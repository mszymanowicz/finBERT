GIP, PSP and APG did not immediately reply to a request for comment.","However, as Britain and the EU are in a last-ditch effort to agree terms to keep trade flowing without tariffs or quotas from the start of 2021, the sale has now stalled and will likely run into the first few months of next year, the sources said.","WPD delivers electricity to about 8 million customers across central and southwest England, and south Wales, according to its website.",($1 = 0.7472 pounds)
