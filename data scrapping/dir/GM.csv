The agency evaluated information related to a lawsuit against the automaker brought by the widower of a 42-year-old woman who died after her 2007 Chevrolet Trailblazer SUV crashed, according to documents Reuters reviewed. The cause, her widower alleges in the lawsuit, was a defective steering sensor that the automaker failed to adequately warn drivers about despite long knowing the component had issues.","The lawsuit, filed in a local Georgia court in 2016 and updated in 2020, is ongoing. GM, the top-selling automaker in the United States, denies the allegations and declined to comment on the decision by NHTSA, the primary U.S. vehicle safety regulator.","The lawyer representing the widower, Lance Cooper, wrote to NHTSA in February 2020 urging it to investigate GM for failing to alert regulators to alleged issues with the sensor in a timely manner and recall affected vehicles, according to the letter, which was reviewed by Reuters. Cooper previously unearthed evidence in another case that helped expose GM’s failure to recall millions of vehicles with defective ignition switches, a crisis that eventually led the automaker to resolve criminal charges in a 2015 deferred prosecution agreement.","Following a request for information from regulators, GM provided documents produced in the recent case focused on the steering sensor, according to court documents.","On Jan. 28, NHTSA officials determined there was “insufficient evidence to lead to a formal investigation at this time,” the agency told Reuters, adding it would take future action if warranted. The agency said the vehicles Cooper highlighted were built before a U.S. regulation began mandating electronic stability control in September 2011.","The sensor is a key part of GM’s version of electronic stability control, called StabiliTrak. Like other such systems, StabiliTrak adjusts brakes and engine power to help drivers avoid losing control and crashing.","Cooper told Reuters he was disappointed with NHTSA’s decision to not pursue an investigation. The risk of the sensor failing and disabling electronic stability control “unquestionably relates to automotive safety,” he said.","Two former heads of NHTSA questioned the agency’s decision not to open an investigation. One said the technology, even if not required, was well on its way to becoming mainstream at the time.","A Reuters review of hundreds of pages of documents submitted in the litigation shows that GM has since 2007 confronted a series of issues with the steering sensor, including high levels of warranty claims and a manufacturing flaw, without recalling affected vehicles.","GM, in responses to questions from Reuters, said it had conducted thorough investigations involving experts across many disciplines. After “a rigorous analysis of internal and external data,” the company said, “we’re not aware of any other complaints alleging accidents” that involve StabiliTrak disengaging due to a faulty steering sensor.","Current and former GM employees have testified as part of the litigation that even after losing StabiliTrak, drivers can still steer and brake, so vehicles remain safe."

General Motors swerved around Covid-19 potholes in third-quarter results released on Thursday. The $50 billion automaker’s adjusted earnings per share of $2.83 were over twice analysts’ estimate, according to Refinitiv. U.S. consumers – possibly buoyed by stimulus or less spending on services – scooped up trucks and SUVs. Belt-tightening, like salary reductions, also helped the North American business post adjusted operating profit margins of 15% — over four percentage points higher than in the same period last year.","And Covid-19 may have actually helped the financing unit. Its adjusted pre-tax earnings of $1.2 billion roughly equaled the total for the entire second half of 2019 – driven by higher used vehicle prices. Demand was likely boosted by consumers worried about public transportation. And constrained supply issues may have also pushed more toward this market. But if government stimulus fails to pump up consumer wallets and repossessions increase, some of these positive trends could go into reverse. (By Anna Szymanski)","COVID RELIEF. America’s biggest companies are toughing out the pandemic. Over 80% of the S&P 500 Index members have now published third-quarter earnings, according to Refinitiv. As the period began, analysts expected them to report, on average, 25% less profit than a year earlier. As things turned out, the year-on-year earnings decline is looking like a mere 8%.","Part of the explanation is an economic rebound. In the second quarter, U.S. GDP slumped 9% from a first-quarter level already dented by early lockdown damage. Last quarter, it rebounded more than 7%, according to an initial estimate from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, leaving output down 3.5% from the final three months of 2019.","Full-year earnings are currently forecast to be 16% below last year’s level, with only technology and healthcare companies bucking the trend with meaningful growth. Analysts foresee 2021 more than compensating. But whether the coronavirus, the economy and whoever occupies the White House help or hinder remains up in the air. (By Richard Beales)","NOW OR LATER. U.S. health insurers have had a good pandemic, but Cigna’s third-quarter results show they will do fine afterwards, too. In the year’s first half, premiums poured in but fewer people visited doctors for fear of catching Covid-19. Even if some of these are postponed indefinitely, patients are now somewhat catching up. Cigna’s medical care ratio – or the percentage of premiums spent on healthcare – rose to 82.6% compared to 80.5% in the same period last year.","Earnings per share rose 6% though, beating analyst expectations on both the top and bottom line. Cigna raised its revenue estimate for the rest of the year. Even once life returns to normal, Cigna is well-positioned. The health insurance industry simply isn’t that competitive. Three-quarters of American metro areas have highly concentrated insurance markets, using the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index. That’s something even Democrats in Washington have struggled to change.

Despite making about half of its revenue in places like Germany, Austria and Eastern Europe, the bank run by Jean-Pierre Mustier suffered a risk premium due to Italy’s wobbly public finances. This meant UniCredit had to pay more for its capital than northern European rivals. In response, Mustier even unveiled a plan last year to hive off UniCredit’s foreign operations into a sub-holding company.","Such a carve-out is no longer needed, Mustier said on Thursday. The European Central Bank’s bond-buying spree has compressed Italian sovereign yields so much that the gap between Italian 10-year state bonds and their German equivalent is now just 126 basis points, from nearly 290 in mid-2019. As such, the expensive reorganisation no longer makes sense. Then again, Mustier could dust it off if M&A options materialised at home or abroad. (By Lisa Jucca)","END OF THE SHOW. Milan’s famed La Scala opera house has become the latest cultural victim of the pandemic. A new lockdown set to start in Italy’s financial capital on Friday and a rash of Covid-19 infections among its musicians and singers forced the 18th-century theatre to scrap its usually bedazzling premiere, scheduled for Dec. 7, for the first time since World War Two.","This will be a sad loss for all the bankers, politicians and VIPs that annually attend Italy’s most sought-after gala.

Investors may be getting overexcited about Covid-19 treatments. The head of the United Kingdom’s Vaccine Taskforce said on Wednesday that AstraZeneca could release a booster by the end of the year. This could in theory see it take a share of a $10 billion market, according to analysts at Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse. The estimates assume the general public will need a dose each year and assume a price of $20 per shot.","AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson have already promised to make successful vaccines available at cost during the pandemic. Although the treatment may become as ubiquitous as the annual flu jab, it will be difficult for pharmaceutical giants, already under scrutiny for price-gouging, to make too much money.

The Penfolds demerger, originally slated for next year, promised to uncork value, but the latest disappointments erased another 7% of market value.","Boss Tim Ford pointed to an uptick in premium sales, or bottles that cost at least A$10 ($7.16).

Deutsche Lufthansa’s 10 billion euro state-supplied parachute is starting to look a bit small. Lower costs and the resumption of limited flights mean the German carrier is burning through 200 million euros of cash a month. That’s a massive improvement from April, when the airline was incinerating as much as 1 million euros an hour. Worryingly, it may not be able to maintain such a lean course.","Unveiling third-quarter results on Thursday, Chief Executive Carsten Spohr admitted the cash drain might climb to 350 million euros per month as the normal winter slowdown hits revenue. That implies Lufthansa’s day-to-day operations will have burnt through 2.1 billion euros by March. Throw in limited capital spending and finance charges, and Lufthansa will have eaten up more than a quarter of its reserves. Without a summer 2021 recovery, Spohr might be in need of a bigger parachute. (By Ed Cropley)"

Cadillac is on a path to very heavy electrification. Buick is also going to heavily electrify,” said Blissett, adding that GM’s Chinese brands Baojun and Wuling would also go down the electric route.",“The market is changing dramatically. So the concept of standing still in China doesn’t work.”,"GM sells its Chevrolets, Buicks and Cadillacs in China as well as its local brands Wuling and Baojun and has been one of the foreign success stories in the world's biggest auto market along with Germany's Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE.","But GM sales have taken a hit, falling to 3.1 million vehicles in 2019 from a record 4 million in 2017.","A slowdown in China’s economy and the resulting weakness in its auto market have been a big factor behind GM’s sales slump, but analysts say competition has become fierce too.","Toyota 7203.T, Volkswagen and Honda 7267.T have been eating into GM's business while Chinese automakers such as Geely 0175.HK and Great Wall 601633.SS are making better-quality cars that can compete more effectively with the global giants.","GM is also facing competition from Tesla TSLA.O while Lynk & Co and Polestar, brands affiliated with Volvo, have rolled out sleek eye-catching designs that Chinese consumers crave.","In 2017, GM China had a 14.3% share of overall sales of 28.2 million vehicles. By 2019, that had fallen to a share of 12.2% out of 25.4 million cars.",Blissett said the key objective of its strategy was to get back to sales of 4 million vehicles a year as soon as possible.,"“Our business is a high engineering cost, high capital cost business, so, without scale, it’s quite difficult to make money. We do need to return to that,” he told Reuters.",He said he could not give a precise timeframe for when GM would hit its goal because of the uncertainty about how fast economies around the world recover from the coronavirus fallout.,"Some GM officials have admitted privately that its brands, especially Chevrolet, have been slow to introduce more SUVs in China as they became increasingly popular.","However, both Buick and Chevrolet now have four SUVs each and Cadillac has three, Blissett said.","Analysts have also said the promotion of its top-end Cadillac brand came at the expense of Buick and Chevy sales, and that it failed to match rivals with their sleeker designs.","Blissett said GM would sell bigger SUVs, many of them electric, for its Chevy, Buick and Cadillac brands, though traditional gasoline-powered SUVs still offered GM “huge opportunities” to boost sales in China.","GM also wants to transform Wuling into a brand more focused on micro, electric “people-mover” vans, he said.","“In the next five years, more than 50% of our capital and engineering deployment will go towards electrification and autonomous-drive technology. That should give you an indication where GM is betting on its future,” GM’s Blissett said.","“Chinese consumers are very embracing of technology, be that technology on the phone, be that e-commerce, be that intelligent driving technology, be that electrification. Although Europe and the U.S. have fairly significant plans on a governmental and market point of view, the electrification of cars is going to happen much faster here in China,” he said.","“We intend to be right in the heart of that market. So, we will heavily play in the EV space. And that’s the reason why we are investing as we are.”",GM’s Wuling and Baojun brands have borne the brunt of falling sales over the past two years as lower-income consumers bought fewer cars in the face of slower growth and as competition from Chinese rivals at the entry level intensified.,"There are signs of life at Wuling, however, with sales up 9.7% in the second quarter of 2020.","GM hopes its new Wuling MINI EV launched this year, a micro two-door car, and a series of similar cars in the pipeline, will help it win back share. Before EV subsidies, the MINI EV can cost as little as 28,800 yuan ($4,150) for a basic model.",‘WINNERS AND LOSERS’,"To be sure, GM has made blunders, such as equipping some compact cars with unpopular three-cylinder engines. That hit GM sales significantly and it had to resurrect a four-cylinder gasoline engine for some models.","Still, analysts said much of the body blow GM’s brands took in China has come from local brands that have significantly improved the quality of their cars and as Japanese and German rivals boosted sales despite a weaker overall market.","Beijing’s emphasis on greener vehicles has also significantly pushed up the costs associated with the designing and manufacturing cars, which have combined to trigger a shake-up of China’s auto industry.","Already, small Chinese brands such as Lifan have gone out of business while French carmaker PSA PEUP.PA has scaled back its operations significantly and Renault RENA.PA, which is in a global alliance with Nissan 7201.T, packed up and left.","“There is a revolution going on in the industry,” said Blissett. “There are also winners and losers in the global brands. The trend is actually for the local brands to lose share if you look at the total trend. Luxury is a gain in share.”","Analysts expect the consolidation in the auto industry to continue unabated in the coming years, with more failures, and also more mergers and acquisitions.","China auto industry expert Michael Dunne said if GM failed to manage its numerous brands in China properly, one might end up becoming a casualty.","“The introduction of Cadillac has had the effect of knocking Buick down a notch in the eyes of Chinese consumers,” he said. “Buick is tilting more towards where Chevy plays, and as a result the two brands are crowding each other and are now throwing weaker punches.”"

She said in that scenario GM should generate cash flow of between $7 billion and $9 billion during the second half.",Analysts were expecting second-half operating earnings of more than $4.4 billion.,"Suryadevara also said GM should repay its $16 billion revolving credit line by the end of 2020, an action that again depends on a continued economic recovery and annual industry-wide U.S. new vehicle sales of 14 million units this year.",But spiking COVID-19 cases across Southern and Southwestern U.S. states have left that recovery in doubt.,"Weekly jobless claims numbers from the Labor Department released last week showed the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits rose, unexpectedly, for the first time in nearly four months, suggesting the labor market was stalling amid the resurgence in new COVID-19 cases and depressed demand.","Asked whether spiking COVID-19 infection rates were hurting demand anywhere, Chief Executive Mary Barra told analysts GM was “cautiously optimistic,” citing improving China and U.S. sales.",GM said it was “working all avenues” to boost U.S. dealer inventories and all of its U.S. full-size pickup truck and full-size SUV plants are back at three shifts.

It also included a US$10.5bn five-year facility, said several sources familiar with the original refinancing discussions.","The new plan has only refinanced the short-term maturities, including the US$2bn loan that has been reduced to US$1.95bn, and the US$4bn three-year loan, the sources said.","GM’s change of plans is indicative of three things: increased pricing in the market, strong preference for shorter-dated commitments and concerns about the auto sector, a third banking source said.","The spreading virus forced most of North America’s auto plants to close, at least temporarily.

We’re taking our mainstream vehicles, our most iconic vehicles, and we’re electrifying them.”",But it is hard to detect a major change of direction from the companies’ production plans.,"According to data from AutoForecast Solutions seen by Reuters, North American production of SUV models by GM and Ford will outpace production of traditional cars by more than eight to one in 2026, and 93% of those SUVs are expected to be gas-fueled.

A global recession triggered by the epidemic “could add strain to balance sheets and ability to fund aggressive technology shifts,” said Morgan Stanley auto analyst Adam Jonas.","In such an environment, automakers are not looking to depart from their winning formula.","They make more profit on each luxury SUV - such as GM’s $80,000 Cadillac Escalade or Ford’s $76,000 Lincoln Navigator - than they do on a dozen compact cars, according to analysts.","Because of that, automakers are replacing compact sedans with small SUVs that share many of the car’s mechanical parts, but sell for more. Ford discontinued the Focus compact sedan in the United States, which gets 31 miles per gallon of gas. Ford customers who want a similar-sized vehicle now can buy a 26 miles-per-gallon Ford Escape compact SUV, whose starting price is $6,000 higher.","That may be good for automakers’ finances, but probably not for the environment.","SUVs and pickups burn more fuel and emit more carbon dioxide than comparable sedans, and those with larger “footprints,” - the area between the points where the wheels touch the ground - are subject to looser emissions standards.","Meanwhile, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump is threatening to roll back tougher fuel economy and emissions standards proposed by his predecessor, Barack Obama, removing an incentive for automakers to make more fuel-efficient vehicles.","That all indicates that any overall reduction in greenhouse gas emissions enabled by new electric vehicles will be largely, or entirely, offset by the continued substitution of gasoline-fueled SUVs for cars, experts say.","The International Energy Agency (IEA) warned of this outcome in October, in a report that showed growing demand for SUVs across the world was the second-largest contributor to the increase in global carbon dioxide emissions from 2010 to 2018.","“If consumers’ appetite for SUVs continues to grow at a similar pace seen in the last decade, SUVs would add nearly 2 million barrels a day in global oil demand by 2040, offsetting the savings from nearly 150 million electric cars,” said the IEA report. The IEA declined to comment on this story.",The Obama White House predicted that doubling average car and truck fuel efficiency from 2011 to 2025 would cut greenhouse gas emissions by 6 billion tons.

The much-anticipated spending bill does not make specific mention of automakers, but sets aside US$454bn to make loans or loan guarantees for companies across all sectors, according to Reuters.","“They want to show liquidity,” a banking source said. “In order to qualify for the government bailout you need to keep your employees on the payroll.”","Companies use revolving credit facilities, known as revolvers, as backstop financing in case short-term commercial paper lines that cover for expenses such as payroll fail to roll over.

This situation is unprecedented. It’s a game changer for the entire market.”","GM could go ahead with the transaction as it was originally offered, reduce the overall size of the financing, or address only near-term maturities, three banking sources said.","The company has two upcoming maturities, including a US$4bn, three-year loan and a US$2bn, 364-day loan, both set to mature in April 2021, according to a second filing with the SEC.","GM may ultimately decide to put the refinancing on hold, the three banking sources said.",The car maker also has a US$10.5bn credit facility that matures in April 2023.,"The debt refinancing was meant to extend maturities, but leave pricing unchanged. It’s an exercise the car maker performs every two years, according to bankers.","The deadline for commitments was Wednesday. Target closing for the financing is mid-April, the banking sources said.","GM drew down on its revolving line of credit to ensure it had access to those funds during this uncertain situation, a GM spokesperson said in an email.","The company, which prior to the draw was projected to have between US$15bn-US$16bn of cash on its balance sheet at the end of the quarter, did not have any immediate cash needs when it made the decision, the spokesperson said in the email.",A JP Morgan spokesperson declined to comment.,"GM’s decision to borrow as early as Friday comes on the heels of a similar choice by rival Ford Motor Co that canceled a debt refinancing transaction after it also announced plans to draw down on its credit facility, two banking sources said.","In February, Ford also asked its JP Morgan-led bank group to refinance US$15.4bn in revolving credits but in March decided to draw down on the facility and postponed its refinancing plans as market conditions deteriorated, two banking sources said.","Ford drew US$13.4bn under its corporate credit facility and US$2bn under its supplemental credit facility, for a total of US$15.4bn. The borrowings will be used to “offset the temporary working capital impacts of the coronavirus-related production shutdowns and to preserve Ford’s financial flexibility,” according to a March 19 Ford press release.","Ford has said it would revisit its refinancing plans as early as September, two banking sources said. GM could decide to do the same, they said.","On Wednesday, Moody’s downgraded Ford further into junk territory, cutting the company’s rating to Ba2, from Ba1, citing “the severe shock of the coronavirus pandemic combined with Ford’s already-weak operating performance and a years-long restructuring that is a drain on cash flow.”","Also on Wednesady, S&P Global downgraded the company’s credit rating into junk, lowering its long-term issuer credit rating to BB+ from BBB-.",Fitch on Monday cut Ford’s credit rating one notch to BBB- with a negative outlook.,A Ford spokesperson referred questions to the March 19 news release.,"Due to its reliance on international supply chains, automakers were one of the sectors expected to be hit hardest by coronavirus.","Ford, GM and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles said March 18 they would shut down their North American plants to stop the spread of the virus, as they bowed to pressure from the union representing about 150,000 hourly workers at those facilities, Reuters reported.","On Monday, trade groups representing automakers including GM, Volkswagen AG and Toyota Motor Corp said in a letter to congressional leadership that the US Congress should set up facilities to provide loans and loan guarantees to large employers, medium-size manufacturers and small businesses facing revenue losses due to COVID-19. The trade groups expect retail sales to be down by as much as 40% in March compared to the same month in 2019.",GM and Ford join a list of companies that have funded their credit lines in order to boost liquidity and preserve financial flexibility in light of the coronavirus pandemic.

But in the electric vehicle market, Tesla is the leader.","Last year, Tesla sold 367,500 electric vehicles globally, including 223,000 in the United States.

Nuro also confirmed it is in talks with NHTSA.","GM Chief Executive Mary Barra and U.S. Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao last week met and discussed the petition at a high level, officials said, but significant work remains at the technical level. Owens said NHTSA officials are “crawling through these petitions because we want to make sure” they are at least as safe as cars on the roads.","“There’s a lot of back and forth between us and the companies,” Owens said during a Reuters interview that also included Chao and other Transportation Department officials. “We’re sharing with them thoughts and ideas and concerns.

The petitions are for up to 2,500 vehicles per manufacturer.","GM initially said it hoped to win approval to deploy the vehicles by the end of this year. But in July its self-driving unit, Cruise, said it was delaying commercial deployment of cars as more testing of the vehicles was required without specifying a new target date.","Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Waymo unit this year began offering some rides with no human driver in its limited autonomous ride-hailing service in Arizona, but with steering wheels and employees watching remote feeds of the vehicles' cameras.","“We’re in communication with them about how they are ensuring the safe operation of the vehicle,” Owens said. “We will continue having a back and forth with them.”"

Passengers in the third row of seats get 10 inches more legroom and a better ride thanks to a more car-like independent rear suspension.",The new Chevy Suburban will grow by 1.3 inches to 225.7 inches long - making it one of the longest passenger vehicles on the market. GM’s big SUVs will be powered by eight cylinder gasoline engines or six cylinder diesel motors.,"The vehicles have a new digital electronic architecture that enables over-the-air software updates and new revenue opportunities, Reuss told Reuters.","""It's huge,"" Reuss said of the potential to sell customers new digital functions or avoid warranty repairs with a software update. Electric car maker Tesla Inc TSLA.O has used over-the-air upgrades as money makers and to fix problems at low cost.","As the industry moves toward electric vehicles, profits from large SUVs will help pay for investments, Reuss said. Those include GM’s plans to build a new battery plant and offer an electric pick-up truck.","The new SUVs are assembled at a complex in Arlington, Texas, a state where many of them will be sold. GM has invested $1.4 billion to expand the Arlington operation, and that gives the company the option to manufacture additional models, Reuss said.","“We don’t want to invest that much..and not have agility,” he said.","The Tahoe and Suburban unveilings cap a substantial investment by GM over the past five years in its largest pickup trucks and SUVs. GM's Detroit rivals, Ford Motor CoF.N and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCHA.MI, are also expanding their large SUV lineups, even as they promise more electrified cars for the future.",Detroit automakers are doubling down again on big SUVs for a simple reason: It pays.,"The Arlington, Texas factory is running 24 hours a day to meet demand, and profit margins on large SUVs can be as high as 30%, or more than $15,000 a vehicle, industry executives and analysts said. Barclays estimated large pickup trucks and SUVs accounted for 72% of GM’s North American profit in 2018.","GM did not disclose pricing or fuel consumption data on the new SUVs, but the average Tahoe sold for $57,414 in November, according to data from ALG, a unit of TrueCar.","U.S. fuel economy rules, instituted under President Barack Obama, encourage automakers to make sport utilities even bigger. Vehicles that have a larger “footprint” because they are long and wide have easier mileage and CO2 emissions targets to meet.","President Donald Trump has said he wants to ease vehicle CO2 standards but has not released a final plan. GM has sided with Trump on fuel economy policy in a dispute with California, which has sued to maintain the stronger Obama era standards.","GM’s sales of big utilities through the end of November were roughly steady year over year, according to sales figures from Automotive News.",But GM faces tougher competition in the segment going forward. Ford has boosted sales of its competing Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator large utilities by 45% through Nov. 30. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV plans to launch a new Grand Wagoneer in 2021.

Together, the improving data appear to validate the Federal Reserve’s decision in October to signal no further interest rate cuts are needed for now. The U.S. central bank cut rates three times this year, starting in July when it reduced borrowing costs for the first time since 2008.","U.S. central bank policymakers are expected to highlight the economy’s resilience when they meet on Dec. 10-11, though trade tensions continue to reverberate in the background.","“This was a strong report, with a solid rise in payrolls, another drop in the unemployment rate, and decent growth in hourly earnings,” said Chris Low, chief economist at FHN Financial in New York. “The Fed will see this as clear vindication of their decision to stop cutting rates.”","Nonfarm payrolls increased by 266,000 jobs last month, lifted by the gain of 60,200 healthcare workers, the most since March, and increased hiring at restaurants and bars, the government’s survey of establishments showed. Manufacturing recouped all the 43,000 positions lost in October.",But colder-than-normal temperatures in November curbed hiring at construction sites and helped to sink mining payrolls.,"The largest increase in payrolls since January pushed job growth well above its monthly average of 180,000 this year. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls rising by 180,000 jobs in November. The economy created 41,000 more jobs in September and October than previously estimated.","Even discounting the roughly 46,000 GM returnees, employment growth exceeded 200,000 jobs last month. The robust payroll gains suggest the Trump administration’s 17-month trade war with China, which has plunged manufacturing into recession, has not yet spilled over to the broader economy.","Some economists said this could buy the Trump administration more time as it negotiates a “phase one” trade deal with China. Top White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow said on Friday the Dec. 15 deadline remained in place for a new round of U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods set to kick in, adding “there’s no arbitrary deadline,” on trade talks.","“The report alleviates pressure on the Trump administration to make a trade deal with China, giving negotiators more leverage to push for a harder line,” said Daniel Zhao, a senior economist at Glassdoor in San Francisco.","The dollar .DXY strengthened against a basket of currencies, snapping a five-day losing streak. U.S. Treasury prices fell. Stocks on Wall Street rallied after a roller-coaster week.","The U.S.-China trade spat has bruised business confidence and undercut capital expenditure, tipping manufacturing into recession. The magnitude of last month’s increase in payrolls is at odds with other labor market data.","Job openings are near a 1-1/2-year low, small business hiring intentions have softened relative to 2018 and the Institute for Supply Management survey’s measure of factory employment has contracted for four straight months.","“While this morning’s reading is a definite improvement, it does little to explain waning momentum over the past ten months,” said Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Stifel in Chicago. “It remains to be seen if such strength signals a turning point to more robust hiring patterns.”","Though the labor market remains resilient despite the business investment downturn, hiring has slowed from last year’s average monthly gain of 223,000 because of ebbing demand and a shortage of workers. The government has said it could cut job growth for the 12 months through March 2019 by at least 500,000 jobs when it publishes its annual revision next February.","Still, job creation is well over the roughly 100,000 jobs per month needed to keep up with growth in the working-age population. The unemployment rate fell one-tenth of a percentage point to 3.5% percent, matching September’s reading, which was the lowest level since December 1969.","A broader measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, fell to 6.9% from 7.0% in October. The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, dipped to 63.2% in November from more than a six-year high of 63.3% in October.","Average hourly earnings rose seven cents, or 0.2%, after increasing 0.4% in October. In the 12 months through November, wages rose 3.1% after advancing 3.2% in October. Wages were held back by the concentration of hiring in low-paying industries.","Average hourly earnings for production and non-supervisory workers, considered a more reliable wage measure, increased 0.3% and were up 3.7% on a year-on-year basis in November.","“That should keep consumer spending in good shape in the coming months,” said Sarah House, a senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities in Charlotte, North Carolina.","Manufacturing employment rebounded by 54,000 jobs in November. Construction hiring rose by only 1,000 jobs, while mining shed 7,000 jobs.","The leisure and hospitality industry hired 45,000 workers. It has added 219,000 jobs over the last four months, with about two-thirds of the gains at restaurants and bars.","There were also increases in professional and business services, financial activities, and transportation and warehousing jobs last month.

The top-line number came in well above the average jobs gains we’ve seen all year, revisions were higher, unemployment rate ticked down, average hourly earnings ticked up and then areas that were previously weak or struggling like manufacturing and retail trade rebounded a bit and other job gains were pretty broad. Health care continues to be a strength of the jobs market.",“Overall this was a very solid report and should put those fears of recession firmly in the rear view.,"“Not only the jobs data, but most economic data will continue to take a back seat to the U.S.-China trade negotiations and that the Dec. 15th date continues to loom over markets in terms of whether we’ll make some significant announcement or progress in terms of delaying those tariffs that are scheduled into effect on Dec. 15. That will continue to be the driver of market action for most of this month.”","SAMEER SAMANA, SENIOR GLOBAL MARKET STRATEGIST, WELLS FARGO INVESTMENT INSTITUTE, ST. LOUIS",“The U.S. consumer has been driving not just the U.S. economy but the global economy. The U.S. is one of the largest consumers in the world. The fact the U.S. consumer continues to chug away continues to be something that’s holding up U.S. growth and has been a stabilizer in the global outlook.”,“It’s a great number. There’s not much in here to look at and say the labor market is slowing meaningfully.”,“One thing that’s been really interesting is that the participation rate has been grinding higher. Not only do you have an improving labor market but you have more people coming in off the sidelines. The 12 month average for the participation rate is 63%. The current number is 63.2 and last time it was 63.3. Now those might not sound like big improvements but when you’re talking about an economy as big as the U.S. every little bit helps.”,“It was a really good number and a lot of our forecast for 2020 is built off the back off the U.S. consumer continuing to spend. This jobs report reinforces that outlook and shows investors they should continue to make sure they’re maintaining their equity allocations while not leaning out over their skis and that they should fight urge to get too defensive too early.”,“You’ve stocks up and yields up and the dollar. At some point yields and the dollar will start to become a headwind for equities. We’re not there yet.”,"“Certainly these numbers are way out of bounds compared with anyone’s expectations. We knew the autoworkers would be returning, but health & education were big numbers as well. You’ve got an outlier number and the market reacts the way it was supposed to based on the labor market.

But it is interesting to see manufacturing plus 54,000. I guess some of that is GM, but overall I would still think that is a positive. Healthcare and business-to-business, as usual, they come to play every single month. The other good trend we are seeing that we saw the last couple of months and continuing this month is the transportation and warehousing.

(Reuters) - Long before the pistons for General Motors Co V-6 engines reach the U.S. No. 1 automaker’s Romulus, Michigan plant, they are seasoned international travelers.","Powdered aluminum from Tennessee is shipped to Pennsylvania and forged at high temperatures into connecting rods for the pistons, which are then sent to Canada to be shaped and polished. They are then shipped to Mexico for sub-assembly and finally the finished pistons are loaded onto trucks bound for Romulus to become part of a GM V-6 engine.","The parts make four international border crossings in all, without a single tariff levied.","“They already have their passports,” said Jim Bovenzi, GM’s executive director of global supply chain on a recent tour of the Romulus plant. “We look at North America as a borderless region. We have parts and components coming back and forth across the border all the time.”","GM’s V-6 engine is just one example of how GM and rivals Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV have used the 25-year-old North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) to shift work to lower-cost facilities across the continent, cutting expenses and boosting returns from the region that represents the bulk of their global profits.","U.S. President Donald Trump now seeks to replace NAFTA with the new United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), signed by the countries’ leaders last November, which he says will boost American jobs.","U.S. automakers have lobbied hard for the new treaty to preserve NAFTA’s effective lack of borders, and say they can work with it because it does just that.","However, if Trump follows through on his repeated threats to pull the United States out of NAFTA if the U.S. Congress does not ratify USMCA, automakers would be forced to pay a patchwork of tariffs under World Trade Organization rules.","That would destroy the cost advantages of their cross-border supply chains - which include U.S. companies employing American workers - and would likely force automakers to redesign their manufacturing models and find cheaper alternatives elsewhere, industry experts say.",The uncertainty means automakers and manufacturers are holding off on key investments.,"“A lot of our production is very, very capital intensive and when you’re deploying that much capital you want to have a clear sense of what the rules are,” said Everett Eissenstat, GM’s vice president for global public policy. “It’s quite important for us to get those (USMCA) rules in place so we can have some stability and predictability to continue to produce and invest here in the United States.”","U.S. business investments fell 3% in the third quarter and 1% in the second quarter, due to concerns over mounting trade tensions, including the issue of NAFTA and tariffs worldwide.","“Businesses are already becoming more cautious about investments,” said Michael Gregory, head of U.S. economics at BMO Capital Markets. “If we get to the point where the administration is actively talking about tearing up NAFTA, I think that would trump any concern about China.”","Democrats, who are pushing for more labor and environmental protections in the new treaty, say they are making progress toward passing USMCA in 2019. But if that does not happen, it risks being postponed in 2020 ahead of the next presidential election, which would mean an extended period of uncertainty.","GM’s Romulus Powertrain plant makes about 400,000 V-6 engines a year for high-margin Cadillac SUVs, light pickup trucks and other GM vehicles","The pistons that end their long journey there are only a small part of the 70-plus trucks bearing parts such as engine blocks or cylinder heads, that arrive there daily.","The Romulus-built V-6 uses 235 parts from 100 primary suppliers. Sixty-seven ship from factories in the United States, 13 from Mexico, 8 from Canada and 12 from elsewhere in the world. Most of the electronics come from Asia.","All told, GM spends $71 billion a year on materials, sourcing 133,000 different parts from 3,100 primary suppliers.","At Romulus, five trucks daily carrying 288 100-pound (45 kg) engine blocks - the heart of the V-6 engine - each come from either a GM casting operation in Saginaw, Michigan, or a supplier in Mexico.","The Mexican parts are cheaper, GM’s Bovenzi said, but using dual suppliers reduces the risk of relying on one plant for a critical part like the engine block.","The more labor intensive it is to make, the more likely a part is sourced from Mexico, according to James Rubenstein, a professor of geography at Oxford, Ohio-based Miami University who has studied the automobile industry and NAFTA.","“Final assembly costs don’t affect the overall cost of a vehicle that much,” he said. “Focusing on labor-intensive parts further down the chain is what really makes a difference.”","When the V-6 engines - now weighing around 500 pounds - are unloaded at GM’s Spring Hill plant near Nashville, an even bigger marriage of components takes place.","As individually labeled V-6 engines move down the line - for Cadillacs and Acadias - about 200 parts from 88 different suppliers are attached. Fifty-eight are American, 12 Mexican, 5 Canadian and 13 from elsewhere.","Spring Hill workers install an automatic transmission from a GM plant in San Luis Potosi, Mexico, a starter and generator made in Tennessee by Japanese supplier Denso Corp, an air conditioning compressor made by Denso in Michigan, a drive belt made by Gates Industrial Corp Plc in Mexico, tensioners and a pulley made by Gates in Canada, converters made in Tennessee by Tenneco Inc and battery cables from China.","Ford and Fiat Chrysler, alongside other major automakers like Japan’s Toyota Motor Corp and Nissan Motor Co, have all built up similar international supply chains to support their North American assembly operations.","The lower costs achieved by such diverse sourcing means better margins on higher-priced vehicles like the Cadillac XT6. The SUV retails for $55,490, almost $20,000 above the average U.S. new car price, and is one of GM’s higher-margin vehicles.","The use of lower-cost countries for more labor intensive parts is now “part of the recipe to compete in the global market,” said Kristin Dziczek, vice president of industry, labor and economics at the Center for Automotive Research (CAR) in Michigan.","European automakers, for instance, have similarly moved production of parts to cheaper, tariff-free countries within the European Union.","Tearing up NAFTA or imposing tariffs would hurt U.S. automakers’ competitiveness, according to Dziczek.","CAR estimated in June that the average price of a U.S.-made vehicle would rise $1,100 if Trump carried out his threat of levying tariffs of up to 25% on Mexican imports over illegal immigration.","North American tariffs would force automakers to move sourcing of lower-cost parts from Mexico to other cheap markets like Vietnam, Dziczek said.","That would be bad for Mexican suppliers, but would also hurt U.S. suppliers and defeat Trump’s aim to boost U.S. jobs, as shuttling parts back and forth between Asia and the United States would not be cost effective.","“If we weren’t getting it from Mexico, we’d be getting it from somebody else’s ‘Mexico’,” Dziczek said. “And the further away that ‘Mexico’ is, the less likely it is American suppliers would benefit from that business.”"

It was one of thousands of lawsuits GM and other automakers faced over the years that claimed that the roofs of their vehicles easily crumpled in rollovers, resulting in severe injury and death.","GM invariably denied the allegations, arguing that roof strength made little difference. Now, Lawlor had in hand evidence to the contrary. Among other documents were 1980s test results showing that people wearing seatbelts in vehicles with stronger roofs were likely to suffer less severe injuries in a rollover.","Such evidence helped persuade a jury to award the plaintiff $15.4 million. But something continued to trouble Lawlor. Only a small fraction of the evidence was aired publicly at trial. Worse, to her mind, was that while dozens of plaintiff lawyers suing GM over roof-crush deaths and injuries had seen much of the same evidence over the previous decade, most of it remained hidden under court-mandated secrecy the lawyers had accepted.","In those 10 years, more than 5,000 seatbelt-wearing passengers died in GM rollover accidents, many more were injured, and the company was still pumping out new vehicles with similar roofs.","As Lawlor saw it, the plaintiff lawyers should have raised alarms. “If you see something so egregious, don’t you think you have a responsibility to do something?” she said.","Lawlor did do something. She embarked on a years-long campaign in and out of the courts to expose the evidence about GM vehicles’ roof strength — a personal mission that culminated in 2016, when tougher federal standards for vehicle roofs took effect.","The secrecy that prompted her to action, however, has remained pervasive in U.S. courts. And as Reuters found, plaintiff lawyers in big product liability cases are often complicit in perpetuating it. Their willing participation in a process that hides critical information about potentially harmful and even deadly products prevents consumers from making informed choices and regulators from taking corrective action.","“Far too many plaintiff lawyers miss the big picture about the good that can be done” by pushing for more transparency in court, said Drew Ashby, a plaintiff lawyer with The Ashby Firm in Atlanta.","That clashes with the image plaintiff lawyers cultivate as champions of transparency, fighting to hold corporate America accountable for making and selling harmful products. As the then-president of the American Association for Justice, the plaintiff bar’s main lobbying group, said in 2014: “Whether it’s dangerous cribs, defective drugs or exploding tires, court secrecy endangers consumers and allows corporations to hide wrongdoing. Americans have a right to know about hazardous and defective products.”","Dozens of plaintiff lawyers told Reuters they feel compelled to go along with entrenched court secrecy. The main reason, they said, is their duty to their clients, as spelled out in state bar association rules. Many plaintiffs have suffered catastrophic injuries and other hardships and literally can’t afford to wait for disputes over what can and can’t be made public as bills mount. Of course, such delays can also be costly to the lawyers, who get paid only when a case is settled or decided in their favor.","“You have to balance the need … for an attempt at prompt resolution for the people who are actually the victims of the defendants’ conduct, and the need for public disclosure,” said Ellen Relkin, a New York plaintiff lawyer who has litigated several high-profile product liability cases.",Plaintiff lawyers’ interests are thus aligned with those of judges who want to keep the wheels of justice moving and of defendants — usually big companies — that prefer to keep details of their inner workings hidden.,"As Reuters reported in June, judges regularly allow information pertinent to public health and safety to be filed under seal, even though court documents are, by law, presumed to be public. In nearly all jurisdictions, judges are required to provide an on-the-record rationale for allowing litigants to file information under seal — to protect trade secrets, for example, or an individual’s medical records — but they rarely do that.","In its analysis, Reuters found that information pertinent to public health and safety was filed under seal in 55 of the 115 biggest product liability cases consolidated in federal courts over the past 20 years. These mega-cases, known as multidistrict litigation (MDL), involved products used by millions of consumers.","The secrecy exacts a heavy toll. In just a handful of cases Reuters analyzed, hundreds of thousands of people were killed or seriously injured by allegedly defective products – including cars, drugs and guns – after judges allowed litigants to file under seal evidence that could have alerted consumers and regulators to potential danger.","It’s a measure of their role in maintaining court secrecy that in nearly all of the 55 big cases, it was plaintiff lawyers who filed the information under seal. That’s because of the way secrecy is baked into the process early on.","During pretrial discovery, when the opposing sides request information from each other to prepare their cases, the defendant usually won’t give plaintiffs any information until they agree to a protective order. In theory, these agreements are meant to keep under wraps potentially damaging proprietary or personal information. But in many cases, nearly everything ends up being stamped “confidential,” and plaintiff lawyers often just agree to the secrecy without complaint.","Later, when plaintiff lawyers begin filing motions or presenting their cases in court, the standard for imposing secrecy moves higher. Material obtained through discovery that is later submitted as evidence becomes part of the court record; as a matter of law, litigants must provide a reason for submitting such evidence under seal, and the judge must approve.","In most of the big MDLs, however, plaintiff attorneys actually cited the defense’s earlier claims of confidentiality to justify filing evidence under seal. Since judges rarely ask for a more specific rationale for the secrecy, documents marked as confidential remain so.","That’s true when the parties settle, which is how most product liability cases end. It can also be true after a jury decides in favor of the plaintiff. Sometimes, plaintiff lawyers even agree to keep evidence confidential that has already been aired in open court in other cases.",Lawyers who do fight secrecy seldom succeed. They challenged defendants’ claims of confidentiality for material relating to public health and safety in 23 of the 55 big cases Reuters analyzed. Judges nearly always refused to unseal the evidence.,"In a GM roof-crush case in the 1990s, Donald Friedman, a former GM engineer, served as an expert witness, analyzing the company’s crash test data. That and most of the other evidence cited in court was marked confidential. After a jury awarded the plaintiff $8.8 million, Friedman determined that everyone should be able to see what he had seen.","Acting on Friedman’s request, Thadd Llaurado, a lawyer on the case, challenged the sealing of GM’s records. After nearly a year of briefs and hearings, the judge turned down Llaurado’s request to lift the protective order.","“GM has shown that the testing information is of value to GM’s competitors,” the judge said in his 1993 decision. Among the records the judge kept under seal were about 10 exhibits that had been cited openly in the trial.","GM declined to comment on past roof-crush litigation. It said that in general, confidentiality safeguards under the law “have not been an obstacle to continuous improvements in safety.”","Yet potentially harmful flaws in many products remain secret years after the first lawsuits are filed. Overly broad protective orders are a big part of the problem, legal experts and plaintiff lawyers said. In 45 of the 55 big MDLs Reuters analyzed, the protective order allowed most any document to be marked as confidential.",One solution is for plaintiff lawyers to push for protective orders that more narrowly define what can be kept confidential.,"The strategy worked for Eric Holland. In July 2018, his legal team won a huge victory when a St. Louis jury ordered Johnson & Johnson to pay $4.7 billion to 22 women who had alleged that their ovarian cancer was caused by Baby Powder and other J&J talc products tainted with carcinogenic asbestos. J&J has appealed the verdict.","Holland told Reuters that many of the documents he thought revealed the full story about talc and asbestos hadn’t come out in the trial and were still deemed confidential. He thought they should be made public. In a separate talc case, he negotiated a protective order with J&J that limited what the company could mark confidential to trade secrets, personal information and the like.",The more specific order made public internal J&J documents showing that the company knew its talc had sometimes tested positive for asbestos. Scientists used that information in a presentation to U.S. Food and Drug Administration officials earlier this year. The agency has since said it may consider new rules to improve talc safety.,"J&J, in a statement to Reuters, noted that it has made thousands of documents available for use in the courts and on its website. The company also said it “has continued to work with plaintiffs’ counsel to negotiate appropriate protective orders to protect documents that contain confidential information.”","For help drafting the narrower protective order, Holland turned to Public Justice, a nonprofit organization that intervenes in cases to get court records unsealed. The group has developed a model protective order that lays out narrow definitions of what can be marked confidential and makes clear that simply marking a document as confidential is not a sufficient reason to later file the information under seal during court proceedings.","As the first and sometimes only people to know that potentially life-saving documents are being sealed, plaintiff lawyers should be the “first line of defense” against harmful secrecy, said Jennifer Bennett, a lawyer with Public Justice.","Court secrecy wasn’t on Paula Lawlor’s radar when she stumbled into a job as a researcher for Michael Piuze, a Los Angeles personal injury and product liability lawyer who has notched big court victories against cigarette maker Philip Morris. Lawlor had been helping him on several different cases when he asked her in 2000 to focus on roof crush.","Piuze’s client was Robbie Lambert, who in 1990 fell asleep at the wheel of his Chevrolet Blazer, which veered off the road and flipped. Lambert was wearing a seatbelt, but the SUV’s roof crumpled inward. The then 18-year-old Lambert, who had just been named to the training team for U.S. Olympic hockey, was left a quadriplegic.","Lambert’s was only the latest among hundreds of lawsuits alleging that roofs on some GM vehicles were too weak to prevent serious injuries and deaths in rollovers. By then, thousands of people had died or been seriously injured in GM rollovers, though it’s impossible to determine whether roof crush was responsible.","Lawlor, a then-47-year-old mother of seven with no college degree, set to work transforming herself into an expert on all things roof crush. She networked with lawyers across the country, some of them sending her documents they had obtained in discovery in their own lawsuits against GM. Her home became a library of binders. She pulled all-nighters poring over documents. She talked about little else with her family.","“Coming home and not thinking about work, that’s not for her,” said Jennifer Preston, Lawlor’s daughter.","As Lawlor pieced together the material, a damning picture emerged: In the 1970s, GM and other automakers persuaded the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to weaken its originally proposed roof-strength standards – after GM vehicles failed to meet those standards in crash tests – but by 1990, GM had conducted its own tests showing that stronger roofs were safer.","The more she read, the more she came to “really understanding how they totally misled everybody all of those years,” Lawlor said.","As the trial date approached, Piuze’s team set up a “war room” where they met to discuss strategy, prepare motions and review discovery material to be used as evidence. And thus Lawlor found herself in that hotel room outside of Los Angeles in 2000, going through piles of more GM documents.","After her work helped Piuze win the $15.4 million verdict against GM in 2001, Lawlor still felt she had to do something. “People were dying,” she said.","“Paula knew more about roof crush than most experts and almost all lawyers,” Piuze said. The two had discussed challenging the protective order in the Lambert case, but “I didn’t have time to get involved in the crusade. I had a lot of clients to satisfy,” Piuze said. Still, Lawlor “had my blessing” to bring the full story to light, he said.","In 2003, she got her chance when she began working on a case for Los Angeles lawyer Garo Mardirossian. In 1999, Bing Lin Duan suffered traumatic head injuries when the Chevy Aerostar van his family had rented for a vacation rolled four times on a road near California’s Sequoia National Forest. The roof caved in by 10 inches. Duan persisted in a vegetative state for about two years before dying from his injuries at age 65.","When Lawlor came to the case, NHTSA was seeking public comments on a proposal to strengthen its vehicle roof strength standards. The agency, analyzing its own data, had found that rollovers were the most dangerous types of crashes from 1995 to 1999.",Lawlor approached Mardirossian about using the Duan case to challenge the secrecy shrouding the GM litigation. He agreed with her plan.,"She knew what to request from GM during discovery. She also knew that some of that information had already been used as exhibits in other trials, which should make them public. This included detailed results of tests GM conducted in the 1980s on Chevrolet Malibu cars — film, data and analysis showing that roofs stronger than the NHTSA standard resulted in less severe injuries in rollovers.","In court, GM and other automakers cited summaries of the Malibu tests that GM engineers published in 1985 and 1990 to argue that roof strength doesn’t matter in rollovers. The automakers also used the partial summary results to convince NHTSA that roof standards on the books since 1971 were sufficient.",GM continued to mark all of it – the published summaries and the test details – confidential under protective orders issued in other cases across the country.,"“We all knew in the industry” about the tests, Madirossian said. “We just couldn’t talk about it freely.” Under the protective orders, lawyers could discuss the discovery material only with expert witnesses and others involved in the litigation.","In a motion filed in Los Angeles Superior Court in 2004, Madirossian argued for sharing the information with safety advocates and NHTSA. “The documents are fifteen to forty years old and are of no commercial value. Finally, all of them are of such paramount importance to the health and safety of the public as to outweigh any interest GM might have in keeping them confidential,” the motion said.","Judge Mel Red Recana ruled in favor of Mardirossian’s motion. Mardirossian estimates that the months-long effort to challenge the confidentiality cost about $100,000 in staff time. As the jury entered its second week of deliberation, the two sides settled. Terms weren’t disclosed.",Recana declined to comment.,"The judge’s ruling freed Lawlor. With copies of GM’s records, she left Los Angeles in 2004 and, with her two youngest children, moved to be near the beach in San Diego to focus on her mission. On one of her frequent seaside walks, it hit her: Take the fight to Washington, D.C.","Money was tight, and she worried about how to pay for her efforts. Then, in 2006, her back was injured in a minor traffic accident, resulting in a legal settlement that paid her $70,000. “When I got the money, I was sure it was meant for me to do something big,” Lawlor said.","She flew to the capital to deliver more than 1,000 pages of GM’s records in person to a NHTSA clerk. In 2007 she gathered engineers, politicians, academics, victims, safety advocates and more for a meeting about roof crush in Washington. She launched a public information campaign that included strategically placed billboards.","In 2007, she co-wrote “Deadly by Design,” a self-published study on how automakers fended off stronger roof-strength standards. She sent it to NHTSA and lawmakers, and it was later quoted in a hearing before a Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation.","She also volunteered with the Center for Auto Safety, a Washington-based consumer safety group, putting together reports detailing the history of the roof-crush controversy. The center was joined by Public Citizen and other advocacy groups in pushing NHTSA to upgrade roof-strength standards.","In 2009, NHTSA published a new minimum standard mandating that the roofs of all passenger vehicles be able to withstand three times their empty weight in tests, doubling the earlier requirement. The agency also changed testing procedures to more closely resemble real-world crashes.","At the time, the agency said the upgraded standard would prevent 135 deaths and more than 1,000 injuries a year. In 2010, the agency published a study that “confirms a relationship between greater roof strength and fewer injuries.”","In a statement to Reuters, NHTSA did not address Lawlor’s efforts or the importance of the documents she shared with the agency. “Safety-related information developed or discovered in private litigation is an important resource for NHTSA,” the regulator said.","After the 2009 rule change, Lawlor took some time off and traveled to France, where she had a religious epiphany. These days, she leads pilgrimages to a holy site in southern France.",Starting in September 2016 — 16 years after Lawlor first came across the documents that launched her campaign — every passenger vehicle sold in the United States was required to adhere to the new roof-strength standard.

The report supported the Federal Reserve’s decision on Wednesday to cut interest rates for the third time this year and signal a pause in the easing cycle that started in July when it reduced borrowing costs for the first time since 2008.","The longest economic expansion on record, now in its 11th year, is being largely restrained by an almost 16-month trade war between the United States and China, which has led to a contraction in business investment and manufacturing.","“The expansion looks set to continue at least through the first part of next year despite the trade war drag,” said Gus Faucher, chief economist at PNC Financial in Pittsburgh. “Today’s solid jobs report means that the Fed is likely to keep rates steady in the near term.”","Nonfarm payrolls increased by 128,000 jobs last month, with manufacturing shedding 36,000 positions because of the strike - the most since October 2009, the government’s survey of establishments showed. Striking workers who do not receive a paycheck during the payrolls survey period are treated as unemployed. The strike by about 46,000 workers at GM plants in Michigan and Kentucky ended last Friday.","Job growth in October was also held back by the release of 20,000 temporary workers hired by the government for the 2020 Census. Excluding the strike and Census temporary hires, economists estimate payrolls rose by about 190,000 last month.","Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls rising by only 89,000 jobs in October. The economy created 95,000 more jobs in August and September than previously estimated.","Manufacturing continues to loom large over the labor market and overall economy, with a survey from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) on Friday showing factory activity firmly stuck in recession in October.","“The longer the drag from the manufacturing recession goes on it will increasingly weigh on service sector businesses and the health of the overall labor market,” said Scott Anderson, chief economist at Bank of the West in San Francisco.","The White House on Friday struck an optimistic note on trade negotiations, with economic adviser Larry Kudlow saying Washington was still aiming to sign an initial deal this month.","U.S. stocks rose on the payrolls data and trade hopes, with the Nasdaq .IXIC and benchmark S&P 500 .SPX hitting record highs. The dollar dipped against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices fell.","Job growth has slowed this year, averaging 167,000 per month compared with an average monthly gain of 223,000 in 2018, in part because of the U.S-China trade spat, ebbing demand and a shortage of workers.","The ISM said its index of national factory activity rose to a reading of 48.3 last month from 47.8 in September, which was the lowest level since June 2009. A reading below 50 indicates contraction in manufacturing, which accounts for 11% of the economy. October marked the third straight month the index was below the 50 threshold.","The index had declined for six straight months. Though the ISM’s new orders and factory employment measures rose, they remained mired in contraction territory.","There are fears the business investment malaise could spill over to the labor market, which is underpinning consumer spending. Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday said he did not see this risk as the labor market remains healthy. Others agreed, citing the stock market gains.","“A stable equity market at the very least loops right back into supporting consumer spending,” said Steve Blitz, chief U.S. economist at TS Lombard in New York.",Solid consumer spending blunted some of the hit on the economy from weak business investment to limit the slowdown in growth to a 1.9% annualized rate in the third quarter. The economy grew at a 2.0% pace in the April-June quarter.,"Consumers are likely to continue carrying the economy. Average hourly earnings increased six cents, or 0.2% last month after being unchanged in September. That kept the annual increase in wages to 3.0% in October.","The one-tenth of a percentage point rise in the unemployment rate to 3.6% last month reflected 325,000 people rushing into the labor force. A broader measure of unemployment, which includes people who want to work but have given up searching and those working part-time because they cannot find full-time employment, increased to 7.0% last month from 6.9% in September, which was the lowest level since December 2000.","The labor force participation rate, or the proportion of working-age Americans who have a job or are looking for one, increased to 63.3% last month, the highest since August 2013, from 63.2% in September.","October’s plunge in manufacturing employment reflected the strike-driven 41,600 tumble in payrolls in the auto sector.
