The existence of the dossier had not been previously reported. Herbalife did not respond to a request for comment and a spokesman for Ackman declined to comment.","Ackman is described in the dossier as being “fiercely competitive,” “extremely smart,” and “aggressive and competitive in all things,” Wapner writes, quoting the report. Ackman “believes he is in the right and stubbornly, inflexibly, sticks to his positions,” Wapner adds, quoting the report.","The battle over Herbalife’s future pitted Ackman, who runs $8.2 billion Pershing Square Capital Management, against Wall Street rivals including Carl Icahn, who bought a big stake in the company in 2013, making it one of Wall Street’s most expensive and enduring fights.","Forensic psychiatrist Park Dietz relied on media reports and television clips to compile the dossier and did not interview his subject directly, Wapner wrote.","Ackman exited the Herbalife short bet this year, ending his six-year long mission. While Ackman lost money on the bet, the Federal Trade Commission investigated Herbalife and settled with the company in July 2016.
