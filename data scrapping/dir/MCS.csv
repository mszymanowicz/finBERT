(tmsnrt.rs/2DbEu6z)","“Yes we are worried about Marcus, we have seen significant outflows from our savings products although I question if they can keep growing at that speed,” a senior executive at one of Britain’s biggest lenders told Reuters.","Marcus has signed up 100,000 customers since its launch, its managing director Des McDaid told Reuters, adding that it wanted to put the lethargy in Britain’s savings market on the agenda.","Since the financial crisis, Goldman Sachs has been trying to attract mass-market deposits to fund its other activities. It launched Marcus, whose emphasis on a customer-friendly image and simplicity contrasts with public perceptions of Goldman Sachs as a pillar of the financial elite, in 2016 in the United States.","But while some such as Royal Bank of Scotland RBS.L and Nottingham Building Society matched Marcus after its British launch, most bank rates are still well below 1.5 percent.",A top executive at another of Britain’s biggest banks said he was more worried about Marcus than other rivals because of the hefty financial firepower and institutional backing that Goldman Sachs provides as one of the biggest investment banks.,"“We worry more about firms who start to play that already have capital... big, meaty players that can stay the course are more concerning than what’s going on in a garage in Shoreditch,” he said, referring to the London home of a number of start-ups.","Start-up digital-only banks like Monzo, Starling and Tandem have succeeded in attracting hundreds of thousands of users in Britain, but have yet to turn that into consistent profits."
