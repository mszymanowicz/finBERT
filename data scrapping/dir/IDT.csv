To take on additional clients, they have to postpone other customers.","IDT is working with the German Centre for Infection Research (DZIF) and partners in Munich, Marburg and Hamburg on its own so-called viral vector vaccine and hopes to start early-stage testing on some 100 people in Germany in September.","It aims to have capacity to produce up to 50 million doses per year of the experimental vaccine which is based on the Modified Vaccinia Ankara Virus developed for smallpox, Betzing said.","Because the new vaccine is underpinned by proven technology, it is likely to be safe and therefore potentially useful for certain risk groups, such as elderly people, he added.","More than 150 vaccine candidates are in various stages of development, with 23 prospects in human trials across the globe. Moderna and Pfizer have launched two late-stage studies that could clear the way for regulatory approval by the end of the year."
