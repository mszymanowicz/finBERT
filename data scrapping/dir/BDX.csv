Six doses can be drawn with low dead space syringes, which minimize the amount of vaccine left in the syringe after use.","If healthcare providers can reliably extract the sixth dose it would allow supplies to be stretched 20% further and could be a financial boost for Pfizer, which is paid per dose.","The U.S. government has begun giving healthcare providers new syringe kits to extract six shots from each vial. It said that three of the low dead space syringes in each six-needle kit would allow extraction, according to an email reviewed by Reuters. A CDC spokeswoman said the new kits would contain a “majority” of low dead space syringes.","Syringe maker Becton Dickinson has contracted with the U.S. government to provide 286 million syringes for use with COVID-19 vaccines, including around 40 million low dead space syringes, and is fully prepared to deliver on that agreement, said Troy Kirkpatrick, the company’s senior director of public relations.","Low dead space syringes are a niche product and Becton Dickinson had not discussed plans with the U.S. government to substantially boost their output when they began preparing for the vaccine rollout last year, he said.","“We are ready to support the U.S. government but we are trying to make sure everyone understands that those devices are not something we have infinite capacity to produce and bringing up new lines does take time,” Kirkpatrick said.","The Franklin Lakes, New Jersey-based company is the largest syringe and needle maker in the world, according to 360iResearch, and Kirkpatrick said it has boosted overall production capacity by about 1 billion syringes for 2021, with most of the capacity allocated.","A new production line for syringes will be functional by July but was not designed to produce additional low dead space syringes, he said. Kirkpatrick said Becton Dickinson is also discussing plans with the U.S. government to deploy pre-filled syringes, which negate the need for vials and can help get more out of existing vaccine supplies.","The federal government has contracts with other manufacturers, and it was not immediately clear whether they could supply more of the specialty syringes.","The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), a federal organizer of the vaccination drive, told providers in an email reviewed by Reuters it has started giving healthcare providers packages including both types of needles.",The email said early testing showed that three low dead space syringes used in combination with three standard syringes may yield the sixth dose.,"“Every effort is being made to reconfigure the ancillary kits with syringes that enable the six-dose draw without impacting the availability or slowing the delivery of supplies to jurisdictions,” the email said.","President Joe Biden has described the vaccine rollout so far as a “dismal failure” and said he will use wartime powers to secure more supplies for the campaign, including low dead space syringes, but experts say that such efforts will still run up against production constraints.","Healthcare distributor McKesson Corp is responsible for assembling the accompanying kits of vaccination supplies, including syringes, that are paired with each tray of Pfizer vaccines. The supplies themselves are procured by the U.S. government.","Moderna Inc, which makes the other vaccine authorized for use in the United States, says it puts 10 doses in each of its vials, but New York State public health officials have said providers can extract 11 doses."

Fitch has also assigned a ‘BBB-’ rating to the company’s unsecured notes issuance.","The bond offering is effectively leverage neutral, excluding the temporary impact from the coronavirus pandemic. The affirmation is supported by the company’s offering of value-based products and technologies that help improve treatment outcomes and restrain unnecessary costs. Continued focus on operational efficiencies should drive consistently positive cash generation, enabling the company to continue to reduce debt over the next two years. BDX successfully reached Fitch’s target of gross debt/EBITDA of 3.5x following the acquisition of C.R. Bard, which is commensurate with the ‘BBB-’ IDR. BDX’s commitment to continued debt reduction could result in positive momentum for the IDR. The ratings apply to $19.4 billion of debt at Dec. 31, 2019.",Key Rating Drivers,"Coronavirus Impact: COVID-19 has had a mixed impact on BDX’s overall business, as the company’s critical care solutions are in high demand but this likely will not fully offset near-term pressures in businesses tied to routine and non-acute care, elective procedures and research. The COVID-19 outbreak primarily impacts the interventional business through reduced elective procedures, the life sciences business due to temporary research lab closures and reduced clinical testing, and the medication management solutions business due to some delays of instrument installations. While Fitch expects near-term demand for select business segments to be dampened, we currently forecast improved healthcare utilization in the second half of CY2020.","Fitch anticipates FY2020 EBITDA margin pressure because of the loss of higher-margin elective procedures and products and a product mix shift to lower-margin items. These effects will not be fully offset by BDX’s temporary cost reduction measures. Fitch still forecasts relatively robust FCF that will continue to support operations and should allow for some debt reduction this year. Fitch assumes the $1 billion debt reduction that BDX has committed to publicly will likely span into CY2021, resulting in a longer timeframe to reach the company’s goal of 3.0x leverage by the end of CY2020. Affirmation of the ‘BBB-’ IDR with a Stable Outlook contemplates the long-term viability and demand of the business and the commitment to debt reduction that may be slightly delayed.","Broadened Portfolio Positioned for Long-Term: The evolving dynamics of healthcare reimbursement, including the increasing need for manufacturers and innovators to demonstrate the value of their products to command market share and pricing growth, contributes to consolidation in the medical device industry. Favorable demographics and ongoing technological advancements will continue to support relatively reliable end-market demand growth. BDX, through its global leadership positions, scale and distribution network, is able to provide a fairly comprehensive product portfolio to healthcare providers and act as a one-stop-shop, creating value and efficiencies for its customer base. BDX is also committed to innovation through its RD pipeline to develop new products and solutions that improve outcomes and reduce healthcare system costs.","Deleveraging In-Line With Rating: The ‘BBB-’ rating reflects that BDX successfully reached gross debt/EBITDA of around 3.5x within two years following the close of the Bard acquisition. Fitch calculates gross debt/EBITDA of 3.6x at Dec. 31, 2019. While the effects of the coronavirus pandemic may stress leverage in the near term, Fitch expects cash generation to remain relatively strong to allow for further debt reduction over the next two years. BDX remains committed to further debt reduction, which could result in positive rating momentum as leverage improves through continued debt paydown and EBITDA margin improvement to normalized levels or beyond. Debt has already been reduced by approximately USD3.0 billion at Dec. 31, 2019, versus the Dec. 31, 2017 level.","BDX increased its acquisitive posture with the 2017 acquisition of Bard and the 2015 acquisition of CareFusion. Prior to these transactions, BDX was historically only modestly acquisitive, evidenced by its cumulative execution of roughly USD500 million of net cash acquisitions since fiscal 2000, excluding Bard and CareFusion.","Further Operational Improvement Expected: BDX continues to improve operations, evidenced by top-line growth, moderately improving margins and increasingly positive FCF. BDX is on track to integrate Bard successfully and to realize the approximately USD300 million of cost synergies targeted within its three-year goal. Revenue synergies are also well under way. Fitch expects margins will decline temporarily in FY2020 in part due to the loss of higher-margin products but will rebound in FY2021 as elective surgeries come back online.","Offering Value to Providers: Many of BDX’s products are on the right side of the value equation in health care. Reducing infection rates, improving medication compliance and increasing provider efficiency all contribute to improving treatment outcomes for patients. Improved outcomes and reduction in medication loss, theft and shelf-life expiries also help reduce costs to providers. The company develops products that offer a strong value proposition, which should support the firm’s ability to continue negotiating favorable payment terms with customers.",Derivation Summary,"BDX is a broadly diversified company with leading market positions in the majority of product platforms and treatment segments in which it operates. The firm is in the top-tier of medical device, diagnostics and product firms in terms of size and scale. BDX is larger and more diversified than Baxter International Inc. (BAX, A-/Stable) and Boston Scientific Corporation (BSX, BBB/Stable). However, its recent acquisitive posture has resulted in higher debt leverage than BAX and BSX. BDX is of similar size and holds leading market positions much like Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. (TMO, BBB/Stable), a life sciences and diagnostics player. TMO maintains an aggressive capital deployment strategy and operates with gross debt/EBITDA around 2.8x-3.2x.","A large portion of sales are generated by consumable and disposable products, reducing BDX’s exposure to potential pricing headwinds to sale of larger and more expensive capital equipment and implantable medical devices. Improving operations, a stable operating environment and an ability to consistently generate meaningfully positive FCF support the company’s credit profile, while its recently increased acquisitive stance weighs on the rating profile.",Key Assumptions,Fitch’s Key Assumptions Within Our Rating Case for the Issuer:,--COVID-19’s largest impact will be to the company’s Q3’20 results with some return to normal utilization starting in company’s Q4’20 results;,--Organic revenue growth in the low- to mid-single digits during normalized periods;,--EBITDA margin pressure in FY2020 due to product mix shift and loss of higher-margin business;,--EBITDA margins rebound to normalized levels of +31% in FY 2021;,--Normalized annual FCF (CFO minus capex and dividends) of over USD2.0 billionؘ;,--Gross debt/EBITDA declines toward 3.0x over 2021-2022 through a combination of EBITDA growth and debt paydown;,--Targeted acquisitions and no share repurchases in the near term.,"Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:",--BDX generates continued strong operating performance that produces consistently positive and increasing FCF;,"--The company demonstrates the willingness, a rationale and an ability to maintain gross debt/EBITDA around 3.0x, with acquisitions driving leverage above that for only relatively short periods of 12-24 months.","Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:","--BDX fails to generate stable operating performance, and FCF materially and durably deteriorates;",--Gross debt/EBITDA maintained above 3.5x due to sustained operational deterioration or a more aggressive capital deployment strategy;,--The negative rating sensitivities are likely to be tripped if the coronavirus outbreak has a greater impact on cash flow that Fitch currently anticipates or BDX recovers lost revenue and EBITDA more slowly than expected beginning in later 2020 and into 2021.,Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario,"International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings, visit here.",Liquidity and Debt Structure,"Sufficient Liquidity: BDX presently has sufficient liquidity, including availability of roughly USD1.9 billion on its USD2.6 billion revolving credit facility at March 31, 2020. Liquidity is bolstered by consistently strong cash generation and cash on hand of USD2.4 billion, which includes a USD1.9 billion short-term unsecured term loan to secure liquidity during market uncertainty related to the coronavirus pandemic. Fitch expects liquidity to remain strong throughout the forecast period.","FCF to Reduce Debt: BDX financed the Bard acquisition with a combination of term loan debt, unsecured bonds and equity. Leverage reduction has been aided by prepayable term loans and near-term bond maturities. Further near-term reduction is expected through repayment of revolver borrowings. Fitch expects BDX will direct most of the cash it generates toward debt repayment until it reaches gross debt/EBITDA of 3.0x.",REFERENCES FOR SUBSTANTIALLY MATERIAL SOURCE CITED AS KEY DRIVER OF RATING,The principal sources of information used in the analysis are described in the Applicable Criteria.,ESG Considerations,"The highest level of ESG credit relevance, if present, is a score of 3.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has confirmed 14 cases of bloodstream infections in children caused by the same strain of the Serratia marcescens bacterium, the agency’s lead investigator on the outbreak said in a telephone interview.","All of the infections occurred in seriously ill children receiving intravenous medications through a catheter or central line, a device used to deliver medications such as chemotherapy. None of the children have died and the number of cases appears to be winding down, the investigator said.","Health officials said they began testing the Becton Dickinson products when their investigation found the syringes had been used to treat several of the infected children. Central lines are often flushed with saline or heparin, a blood thinner, to keep them clear.","So far, none of the Becton Dickinson products have tested positive for the bacterium. Last month, the company recalled 949 lots of its BD PosiFlush Pre-Filled Heparin Lock Flush Syringes and Pre-Filled Normal Saline saline flush syringes sold between February and December 2017 out of “an abundance of caution.” Becton Dickinson said it was cooperating with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and CDC.","“The company immediately initiated an internal investigation after being notified of a potential connection between catheter-related blood stream infections and the Serratia marcescens bacterium,” BD said in an emailed statement on Friday.","BD spokesman Troy Kirkpatrick said the company had checked records from its sterility testing, environmental testing and clean room validation.","“To date, no BD flush product has ever tested positive for this bacterium,” Kirkpatrick said in an email.","Dr. Kiran Mayi Perkins of the CDC’s Public Health Program, who is leading the investigation, said if there is contamination, it’s “probably a very low amount,” which makes it very hard to test for.","“Although the product tests have been negative to date, again, in an abundance of caution, we continue to take the steps we have,” she said. “That’s probably why BD has done the recall as well.”","Perkins said the confirmed infections occurred in Tennessee, Colorado, Minnesota and Ohio and most of the children were recovering well.","Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease expert at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, said Serratia marcescens is found in the environment and is a common cause of bloodstream infections in hospitals.","“What’s dangerous is when it’s in something that’s being directly injected into a person,” he said. “That bacteria doesn’t have to go through any kind of barrier. It’s a superhighway into the bloodstream.”","All of the recalled products were made at Becton Dickinson’s facility in Franklin, Wisconsin.","Becton Dickinson also sells the heparin flush and saline syringe products in Canada, Bermuda, and Brazil. The company said it was working with regulators in those countries to issue advisories and recalls. The recalled products make up about 10 percent of the company’s supply of heparin and flush syringes in the countries involved in the recall."
