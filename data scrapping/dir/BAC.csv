The Department of Justice has so far brought charges against 82 individuals in 56 cases for around $250 million in loans, according to a review by the Project On Government Oversight.","So far, the burden on lenders has mostly been administrative. One veteran attorney who advises major banks on compliance matters said clients were responding to as many as 20 law enforcement subpoenas a week, producing documents and making employees available for interviews.","There is increasing concern, though, that the lenders themselves will face legal challenges over PPP, already leading to internal compliance reviews, investor warnings and even the outright sale of loan portfolios, according to public statements and people familiar with the situation.","At least four banks have warned investors in shareholder filings about PPP regulatory and legal risk. Bank of America, for example, said in a July filing that its participation in government stimulus programs “could result in reputational harm and government actions and proceedings, and has resulted in, and may continue to result in, litigation, including class actions.”","“We fully cooperate with government inquiries,” said Bill Halldin, a Bank Of America spokesperson.","Among the possible hazards, experts have pointed to potential violations of the program’s first-come, first-served application rules, disadvantaging minority-owned and women-owned businesses; maintaining adequate documentation, especially for loan forgiveness applications; and abiding by broader “know your customer” rules, which could have spotted more fraud.","Congress passed the $2.2-trillion Cares Act bailout in March which included nearly $350 billion for PPP loans, with the pot later increasing.","Under pressure to get the cash out the door fast, banks were initially concerned they would be taking on too much liability, even if they stood to earn origination fees of up to 5%, and 1% interest payments on government-guaranteed loans. Lenders secured a promise from the government that they would not be held responsible if borrowers broke the program rules.","An October congressional report said that several lenders, including JPMorgan, PNC Financial Services Group Inc and Truist Financial Corp, processed larger PPP loans for wealthy customers at two to four times the speed of smaller loans for the neediest small businesses.",It also said some banks limited their PPP loan programs to existing customers.,"That decision, the report said, had a disproportionately adverse effect on women-owned and minority-owned businesses, because they are less likely to have pre-existing banking relationships, according to U.S. Federal Reserve data. Depending on the circumstances, policies that hurt such “protected” groups - even if inadvertently - can violate fair lending rules.","Citing an internal April presentation, the report said that Citigroup identified the negative effect on these businesses as a possible compliance risk, but decided to initially prioritize existing customers because demand was high and it required less manual intervention.

It’s not surprising that analysts are taking down earnings estimates.”","The central bank’s change in tack put the brakes on what had been a pattern of quarterly rate hikes, amid signs of slowing economic growth.","Slowdown jitters have also hit 10-year Treasury yields. The benchmark bond’s yield hit a 15-month low in the first quarter, flattening the yield curve and narrowing the gap between the interest banks pay depositors and the interest they charge consumers, which is bad news for profits.","“That’s why the estimates are going down,” Carlson added. “(Analysts are) fearful of interest margins for banks and there’s an underlying concern about loan growth.”","In the first three months of the year, the S&P 500 bounced back from a sell-off in December, gaining 13.1%, its biggest quarterly increase since 2009. But financials underperformed the wider market, gaining 7.9% in the quarter as the new low-interest-rate normal that boosted other sectors was a headwind for banks.","Since October, analysts have drastically lowered their expectations for S&P 500 earnings in 2019, with first-quarter estimates dropping from 8.1% growth to a year-over-year decline of 2.2%. That would mark the first quarter of negative growth since the earnings “recession” that ended in 2016.",The partial federal government shutdown in January and an expected drop in trading revenues provided additional impetus for analysts to cut first-quarter bank earnings estimates.,"In a KBW note dated April 3, lead analyst Brian Kleinhanzl sees median year-on-year revenues from both equities and fixed income, currencies and commodities (FICC) trading to have dropped by 15% in the quarter.","“Within financials, the industry that’s been hit hardest is capital markets,” said Tajinder Dhillon, senior research analyst at Refinitiv on London. “Those downward revisions have intensified over the last 90 days. Of the big 6 banks, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan have seen the biggest declines” in first-quarter earnings estimates.",But some analysts believe the effects on banks of a more accommodative Fed and the flattened yield curve are overstated.,"Oppenheimer lead analyst Chris Kotowski wrote in a March 25 note “to be sure, rates and the yield curve have had an effect on bank earnings.” But he called the impact from the Fed’s decision “a minor one,” and wrote that aside from these impacts, “bank fundamentals are remarkably stable.”","Recent history shows that large U.S. financial institutions have beat analyst estimates at a higher rate than the broader market. In the eight most recent quarters, the six banks have beat earnings estimates 83.3% of the time on average, compared with the S&P 500’s 75.4% average beat rate. Additionally, bank revenues surprised to the upside 79.2% of the time, while S&P 500 company revenues came in ahead of analyst estimates 68.3% of the time, per Refinitiv data.","(For a graphic on 'U.S. banks beat/miss track record' click, tmsnrt.rs/2Vmv2DP)","In today’s late-cycle reality, however, it is not clear that banks can beat even lowered expectations.

The resulting volatility in equity, bond and commodity markets sent many investors to the sidelines, pushing down bond trading volume and hurting the value of credit market assets sitting on banks’ own books.","“You had a one-two punch of market losses on inventory along with a lot of bank clients stepping back from market because you couldn’t have much of an opinion given the uncertainty,” said Jeffery Harte, bank analyst at Sandler O’Neill & Partners.","Credit spreads, the measure of additional compensation investors demand for owning riskier corporate securities over safer U.S. Treasuries, widened in the fourth quarter by the most in more than seven years both for investment-grade and high-yield, or junk, bonds, according to ICE BofAML index data.","Moreover, corporate bond issuance largely dried up, slicing into underwriting fees.","As quarterly results spilled out this week, it became clear that it all added up to a sizable hit for Wall Street’s biggest players.","Bank of America said fixed income fees fell 5 percent because of lower debt underwriting and advisory fees, while its adjusted sales and trading revenue fell 6 percent, with a 15 percent fall in bond trading. Goldman Sachs’ bond trading revenue slid 18 percent to $822 million, far from its peak of more than $6 billion.","In both cases, a big surge in equity trading volumes during the quarter helped offset those losses.",But JPMorgan missed profit estimates for the fourth quarter as its bond trading revenue slump overpowered strong consumer loan growth.,"At Citigroup, Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach said for much of the quarter corporate and investor clients “remained on the sidelines, waiting for some clearer market conditions.” Citi reported a 21 percent fall in revenue in its markets and securities business for the quarter.","After being slow to address the spasms in financial markets, Fed officials in recent weeks have said they are mindful of how such moves have tightened financial conditions. The Fed raised interest rates four times in 2018, but since the start of this year a chorus of Fed officials, including Chairman Jerome Powell, have come out to pledge that they will take it slow from here.",That dovish tone has investors in a better mood so far in the first quarter.,"The S&P 500 is up more than 11 percent from its Dec. 24 low and junk bonds are enjoying their strongest start to a year in a decade, according to ICE BofAML’s high-yield index.","The S&P bank sector has risen 17.5 percent since its Dec. 24 low, including a 5.6 percent gain since Citigroup kicked off earnings season on Monday.","Even as “the potential for tape-bombs from trade and political developments still present challenges, the dovish pivot at the Fed has helped calmed markets,” said Craig Bishop, lead strategist for U.S. fixed income strategies at RBC Wealth Management. “This has contributed to tamping down fixed income volatility, so to me it could be just a matter of one bad month/quarter.”",But no one is quite ready to dismiss the possibility that the environment could change quickly again for the worse.,"“That could change tomorrow,” said Sandler O’Neill’s Harte. “That’s the trouble with trading revenues, they’re awfully volatile. But at least today the first quarter is looking a lot better than the fourth.”"
