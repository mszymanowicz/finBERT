We’re very much working on a set of proposals based on the creative ideas the U.S. came up with in March and I think there was good constructive progress,” she added.",The ministers are expected to meet again on Thursday.,"U.S. President Donald Trump’s negotiators initially demanded that North American-built vehicles contain 85 percent content made in NAFTA countries by value, up from 62.5 percent now. But industry officials say that has been cut to 75 percent, with certain components coming from areas that pay higher wages.","The U.S. trade representative was still pushing its proposal for wage standards for certain auto parts, a person briefed on the talks told Reuters.","This plan would set the overall regional content requirement for autos at 75 percent, but would provide more credit toward reaching that goal for final assembly and manufacturing of certain high value parts like engines in higher wage areas paying around $15 an hour, the source said.","Some lower-value parts and materials would qualify for 70 percent and 65 percent regional thresholds, the source added.",The plan aims to preserve high-value production in the United States and Canada and put upward pressure on auto industry wages in Mexico.,Freeland said Canada remained opposed to the U.S. idea of introducing a “sunset clause” that would allow one of the three NAFTA members to quit the pact after five years.,"“Our view is that this is absolutely unnecessary,” she said, noting that NAFTA already contained a withdrawal mechanism.",Stakeholders argue that putting such a clause in place would create uncertainty for investments.,"Mexico’s negotiators are also unhappy about having to deal with the steel tariff threat in parallel with the NAFTA negotiations, a Mexican source said. The sunset clause likewise remained a sticking point, the source added.","Freeland reiterated Canada’s opposition to the proposed U.S. steel and aluminum duties. Trump unveiled the tariffs in March but suspended them for Canada and Mexico until May 1, citing the wish to see progress at the NAFTA talks.","“Canada’s position has been clear from the outset and that is that Canada expects to have a full and permanent exemption from any quotas or tariffs,” Freeland said.","Separately, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s chief of staff, Katie Telford, who attended some of the most recent NAFTA talks, said late on Wednesday that she would “probably” be flying back to Washington on Thursday.","Although the Trump administration has been pressing for a quick deal, several major topics remain to be settled."

In the U.S. case, critics of Trump’s policy say there is no such threat.",The EU said it wanted to hold consultations with the United States as soon as possible.,"U.S. President Donald Trump announced the tariffs last month, causing a global outcry because the penalties were seen as unjustified and populist.",Countries can claim exemption from many international trade rules if they can show they are imposing tariffs to protect their national security. But those exemptions do not apply for safeguard sanctions.,"The EU and other U.S. allies are not only worried the tariffs will limit that amount of their goods getting into the United States. They also fear steel barred from the United States will flood back into their markets, causing a glut.","China had said it will retaliate by putting duties on up to $3 billion of U.S. imports including fruit, nuts and wine.",The EU is drawing up its own list of duties.
