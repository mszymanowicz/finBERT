In July 2020, the company said it would speed its clean energy transition by selling its non-nuclear power plants, which include over 6,750-megawatt (MW) of gas-, oil- and coal-fired generation.","“The process will accelerate the transformation of our power generation business into a zero carbon emitter,” PSEG CEO Ralph Izzo told Reuters this week.","Izzo said PSEG expects final bids for the plants by May or June. The company, which supplies power and gas to around 2.6 million customers, will remain a major electric generator by investing in offshore wind power and maintaining its three nuclear power plants.","In December, PSEG agreed to buy a 25% interest in the 1,100-MW wind farm Orsted A/S is building off New Jersey. That plant will cost around $5 billion based on industry estimates and is expected to enter service in 2024.","“We intend to participate further in offshore wind opportunities,” Izzo said, noting PSEG has another site it co-owns with Orsted with access to Maryland and New Jersey."

We do not have plans to purchase or expand the gas fleet,” Izzo said, noting the company will shut its last coal-fired power plant in Bridgeport, Connecticut by June 2021.","PSEG has about 11,000 megawatts of generating capacity. About 60% of the power those plants produce comes from nuclear reactors, 30% from gas, 8% from coal and 2% from solar. One megawatt can power about 1,000 U.S. homes.","The three gas plants the company plans to keep through 2046 are in Sewaren, New Jersey, Keys, Maryland, which were completed in 2018, and in Bridgeport, Connecticut, completed earlier this year.","“If energy storage and advanced nuclear technologies come along and allows us to deal with the dispatchability limitations of renewables, then we can face the challenge of retiring the remaining gas plants,” Izzo said.","In addition to shutting all but three of the company’s gas plants by 2046, Izzo said PSEG has no plans at this point to extend the licenses of its three nuclear reactors at the Salem and Hope Creek stations in New Jersey beyond their current operating licenses, which expire between 2036-2046.","To replace the missing generation, Izzo said PSEG would focus on its $2.5 billion energy efficiency program and offshore wind and solar energy projects.","“The goal is to make sure people are using as little energy as possible, that the electricity we generate is as clean as possible and that we electrify as much of the economy as possible,” Izzo said.",Gas overtook coal as the nation’s leading source of power generation in 2016 and is expected to keep that title for the next 30 years.
