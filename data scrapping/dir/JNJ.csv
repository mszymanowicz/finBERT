U.S. officials are continuing their review of what are now eight reported instances of rare clotting combined with low blood platelets in the United States.","Britain's health regulator has recommended people under the age of 30 get an alternative COVID-19 vaccine, if possible, rather than the AstraZeneca shot, while some other European countries are only administering the shot to older people.","Amid concerns that rare side effect reports could undermine confidence, vaccine and immunology experts said clotting risks for both shots remain extremely low and the vaccines are highly effective in preventing COVID-19 death and severe disease.",Here's what we know so far:,WHAT HAS HAPPENED?,"With both the AstraZeneca and J&J vaccines, the reports involve extremely rare clotting, mainly a type of blood clot called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), that were seen in combination with low levels of blood platelets, called thrombocytopenia.",The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said most clots had occurred in the brain and abdomen.,"A U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) committee has scheduled a meeting for April 23 to review clots linked to the J&J vaccine, with a possible decision to follow. The U.S. agencies, like their European counterparts, described the clotting as extremely rare.","There have been more than 300 clotting incidents with low platelets reported worldwide, out of tens of millions of shots administered, according to the EMA.",That includes 287 cases of clotting -- including CVST and splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT) which is clotting in veins in the abdomen -- linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine worldwide.,"Of that total, 142 were in the European Economic Area (EEA) out of more than 30 million AstraZeneca vaccine doses administered in Britain and the European Economic Area over the past three months.","The EMA's J&J review covered eight cases in people who got the shot in the United States. All cases occurred in people below 60 years of age, and most were in women, within three weeks of the person being vaccinated.",About 8 million doses of the J&J vaccine have been given in the United States so far.,Five cases have been reported after administration of Moderna's (MRNA.O) shot and 25 after Pfizer's (PFE.N).,"The EMA said early this month that of the cases that it has reviewed in depth, 18 were fatalities.",WHAT HAVE THE COMPANIES SAID?,"J&J said a new package label will include a warning on the risk of the rare side effect and instructions on how to recognise and treat it. The company said on April 20 it would restart shipments to the European Union, Norway and Iceland, and is working on restarting clinical trials.","AstraZeneca, which is still delivering its vaccines, said it was ""working to understand individual cases and ""possible mechanisms that could explain these extremely rare events"".",WHAT HAVE REGULATORS SAID?,"The U.S. regulator has paused the use of J&J's single-dose vaccine ""out of an abundance of caution"" to ensure that the health care providers are aware of potential side effects and can plan for ""proper recognition and management.""","In part, the pause served to help make sure doctors were aware of treatment options, including what medications to give to help resolve the clots, without further endangering patients’ lives.","Britain's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, meanwhile, has made its recommendation for an alternative vaccine to AstraZeneca's to be used for people under 30 after reviewing 79 cases of rare clotting coupled with low platelets, with 19 fatalities - 13 women and six men.",Eleven of the deaths were of people under the age of 50 and three were under the age of 30.,WHAT TREATMENT IS RECOMMENDED?,"In the United States, health officials said treatment of the blood clots with possible ties to the J&J vaccine differs from what might be considered standard in such situations.","""Usually, an anticoagulant drug called heparin is used to treat blood clots,"" they said. ""In this setting, administration of heparin may be dangerous, and alternative treatments need to be given.""","The EMA, so far, has said heparin should not be given until a diagnosis of a similar condition -- called heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) -- is ruled out. Alternative anti-coagulants can be used, including fondaparinux or argatroban.","But even once HIT is excluded, the EMA says ""it still is unclear whether patients with (the post-vaccination clotting) syndrome could be treated with heparin, mostly because there is little evidence.""","German doctors and scientists investigating clotting associated with AstraZeneca shots havealso said the heparin issue remains ""unclear,"" and have recommended that medical professionals administer intravenous immunoglobulin plus anticoagulant.",HOW DID REGULATORS COME TO THEIR DECISIONS?,"For AstraZeneca's shot, the EMA said in March that, on average, just 1.35 cases of CVST might normally have been expected among people under 50 within 14 days of receiving the vaccine, whereas by the same cut-off date 12 cases had been recorded.","By comparison, four women out of 10,000 would get a blood clot from taking oral contraception.",British officials who recommended people under 30 receive an alternative vaccine drew on statistics from the University of Cambridge's Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication.,"According to the Centre, the risk of serious harm due to vaccination falls the older people get and the number of admissions to intensive care units falls sharply thanks to vaccinations, boosting the AstraZeneca shot's benefit-to-risk ratio.","The Centre concluded that only 0.4 people for every 100,000 in the 50-59 age group would suffer vaccine-linked harm, while 95.6 ICU admissions per 100,000 people would be prevented.",WHAT'S THE EU DOING NOW?,"The EMA, which said the benefits of using AstraZeneca and J&J vaccines continue to outweigh any risks, said that unusual blood clots with low blood platelets should be listed as very rare side effects and has left it up to countriesto decide on how to proceed.","Their decisions may vary from nation to nation, the EMA said, depending on factors like infection rates and whether there are vaccine alternatives. Denmark, for instance, has opted to suspend AstraZeneca’s shot, and is still mulling plans for J&J’s vaccine.",ANY THEORIES ON CAUSE OF THE CLOTS?,"Among possible causes being investigated are that the vaccine triggers an unusual antibody in rare cases. So far, risk factors like age or gender have not been singled out.","While most of the cases reported, so far, involving AstraZeneca have been in women, scientists in Germany say that may be misleading, since women made up most of those people who received the shot.","Health regulators and scientists are also exploring whether the clotting problem may affect the whole class of so-called viral vector vaccines, which EMA said was possible while noting differences in the two shots.","German scientists at Greifswald University have concluded the extremely rare cases of clotting with low platelets - something they are calling ""vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia"", or VITT - are triggered in part by antibodies found in the affected patients following vaccination with AstraZeneca's shot.","Separately, Norwegian scientists have drawn similar conclusions - that AstraZeneca's vaccine triggered an immune response that may have led to clotting in a small number of people - in their own investigations.",J&J has agreed to work with Greifswald scientists to research the potential cause.

To put this into perspective, it’s similar to the chance of being struck by lightning in any given year in the UK. On the other hand, the risks from COVID-19 are substantial.

The $416 billion baby-powder maker isn’t aiming to make a profit from the vaccine during the pandemic anyway.","With similar tiny but serious risks potentially attached to AstraZeneca's (AZN.L) nonprofit jab, it's more an opportunity for Pfizer (PFE.N) and Moderna (MRNA.O). America has already agreed to purchase 600 million doses from the two companies, so they probably won’t sell many more stateside. And their vaccines are too costly for developing economies. Yet rich and middle-income countries still seeking contracts now have an additional reason to pick Pfizer and Moderna. That could be significant gravy for the profit-seeking firms. Pfizer alone estimated in January there would be $15 billion worth of vaccine revenue in 2021.","There's a bigger picture, too.

U.S. officials are continuing their review of what are now eight reported instances of rare clotting combined with low blood platelets in the United States.","Britain's health regulator has recommended people under the age of 30 get an alternative COVID-19 vaccine, if possible, rather than the AstraZeneca shot, while some other European countries are only administering the shot to older people.","Amid concerns that rare side effect reports could undermine confidence, vaccine and immunology experts said clotting risks for both shots remain extremely low and the vaccines are highly effective in preventing COVID-19 death and severe disease.",Here's what we know so far:,WHAT HAS HAPPENED?,"With both the AstraZeneca and J&J vaccines, the reports involve extremely rare clotting, mainly a type of blood clot called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), that were seen in combination with low levels of blood platelets, called thrombocytopenia.",The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said most clots had occurred in the brain and abdomen.,"A U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) committee has scheduled a meeting for April 23 to review clots linked to the J&J vaccine, with a possible decision to follow. The U.S. agencies, like their European counterparts, described the clotting as extremely rare.","There have been more than 300 clotting incidents with low platelets reported worldwide, out of tens of millions of shots administered, according to the EMA.",That includes 287 cases of clotting -- including CVST and splanchnic vein thrombosis (SVT) which is clotting in veins in the abdomen -- linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine worldwide.,"Of that total, 142 were in the European Economic Area (EEA) out of more than 30 million AstraZeneca vaccine doses administered in Britain and the European Economic Area over the past three months.","The EMA's J&J review covered eight cases in people who got the shot in the United States. All cases occurred in people below 60 years of age, and most were in women, within three weeks of the person being vaccinated.",About 8 million doses of the J&J vaccine have been given in the United States so far.,Five cases have been reported after administration of Moderna's (MRNA.O) shot and 25 after Pfizer's (PFE.N).,"The EMA said early this month that of the cases that it has reviewed in depth, 18 were fatalities.",WHAT HAVE THE COMPANIES SAID?,"J&J said a new package label will include a warning on the risk of the rare side effect and instructions on how to recognise and treat it. The company said on April 20 it would restart shipments to the European Union, Norway and Iceland, and is working on restarting clinical trials.","AstraZeneca, which is still delivering its vaccines, said it was ""working to understand individual cases and ""possible mechanisms that could explain these extremely rare events"".",WHAT HAVE REGULATORS SAID?,"The U.S. regulator has paused the use of J&J's single-dose vaccine ""out of an abundance of caution"" to ensure that the health care providers are aware of potential side effects and can plan for ""proper recognition and management.""","In part, the pause served to help make sure doctors were aware of treatment options, including what medications to give to help resolve the clots, without further endangering patients’ lives.","Britain's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, meanwhile, has made its recommendation for an alternative vaccine to AstraZeneca's to be used for people under 30 after reviewing 79 cases of rare clotting coupled with low platelets, with 19 fatalities - 13 women and six men.",Eleven of the deaths were of people under the age of 50 and three were under the age of 30.,WHAT TREATMENT IS RECOMMENDED?,"In the United States, health officials said treatment of the blood clots with possible ties to the J&J vaccine differs from what might be considered standard in such situations.","""Usually, an anticoagulant drug called heparin is used to treat blood clots,"" they said. ""In this setting, administration of heparin may be dangerous, and alternative treatments need to be given.""","The EMA, so far, has said heparin should not be given until a diagnosis of a similar condition -- called heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) -- is ruled out. Alternative anti-coagulants can be used, including fondaparinux or argatroban.","But even once HIT is excluded, the EMA says ""it still is unclear whether patients with (the post-vaccination clotting) syndrome could be treated with heparin, mostly because there is little evidence.""","German doctors and scientists investigating clotting associated with AstraZeneca shots havealso said the heparin issue remains ""unclear,"" and have recommended that medical professionals administer intravenous immunoglobulin plus anticoagulant.",HOW DID REGULATORS COME TO THEIR DECISIONS?,"For AstraZeneca's shot, the EMA said in March that, on average, just 1.35 cases of CVST might normally have been expected among people under 50 within 14 days of receiving the vaccine, whereas by the same cut-off date 12 cases had been recorded.","By comparison, four women out of 10,000 would get a blood clot from taking oral contraception.",British officials who recommended people under 30 receive an alternative vaccine drew on statistics from the University of Cambridge's Winton Centre for Risk and Evidence Communication.,"According to the Centre, the risk of serious harm due to vaccination falls the older people get and the number of admissions to intensive care units falls sharply thanks to vaccinations, boosting the AstraZeneca shot's benefit-to-risk ratio.","The Centre concluded that only 0.4 people for every 100,000 in the 50-59 age group would suffer vaccine-linked harm, while 95.6 ICU admissions per 100,000 people would be prevented.",WHAT'S THE EU DOING NOW?,"The EMA, which said the benefits of using AstraZeneca and J&J vaccines continue to outweigh any risks, said that unusual blood clots with low blood platelets should be listed as very rare side effects and has left it up to countriesto decide on how to proceed.","Their decisions may vary from nation to nation, the EMA said, depending on factors like infection rates and whether there are vaccine alternatives. Denmark, for instance, has opted to suspend AstraZeneca’s shot, and is still mulling plans for J&J’s vaccine.",ANY THEORIES ON CAUSE OF THE CLOTS?,"Among possible causes being investigated are that the vaccine triggers an unusual antibody in rare cases. So far, risk factors like age or gender have not been singled out.","While most of the cases reported, so far, involving AstraZeneca have been in women, scientists in Germany say that may be misleading, since women made up most of those people who received the shot.","Health regulators and scientists are also exploring whether the clotting problem may affect the whole class of so-called viral vector vaccines, which EMA said was possible while noting differences in the two shots.","German scientists at Greifswald University have concluded the extremely rare cases of clotting with low platelets - something they are calling ""vaccine-induced immune thrombotic thrombocytopenia"", or VITT - are triggered in part by antibodies found in the affected patients following vaccination with AstraZeneca's shot.","Separately, Norwegian scientists have drawn similar conclusions - that AstraZeneca's vaccine triggered an immune response that may have led to clotting in a small number of people - in their own investigations.",J&J has agreed to work with Greifswald scientists to research the potential cause.

South Africa also suspended use of J&J’s vaccine.","Acting U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Janet Woodcock said the agency expected the pause to be a matter of days, and was aimed at providing information to healthcare providers on how to diagnose and treat the clots.",The moves come after European regulators said earlier this month they had found a possible link between AstraZeneca’s (AZN.L) COVID-19 vaccine and a similar rare blood clotting problem that led to a small number of deaths.,"FDA official Peter Marks said it was ""plainly obvious"" the J&J cases were ""very similar"" to the AstraZeneca ones.

The FDA will then review the analysis.,"All six cases involved women between the ages of 18 and 48, with symptoms occurring six to 13 days after vaccination. The FDA said patients should watch for up to three weeks for symptoms including severe headache, abdominal pain, leg pain or shortness of breath.","In the cases, a type of blood clot called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) was seen in combination with low levels of blood platelets, or thrombocytopenia.","J&J, whose shares closed down 1.3%, said it was working closely with regulators and noted no clear causal relationship had been established between the clots and its vaccine.","""To put this into perspective, it's similar to the chance of being struck by lightning in any given year in the UK. On the other hand, the risks from COVID-19 are substantial,"" said Ian Douglas from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine.","The J&J and AstraZeneca vaccines both use an adenovirus - a harmless cold virus - as a vector to deliver instructions for human cells to produce a protein found on the surface of the coronavirus, spurring the immune system to recognize and attack the actual virus.",Chinese and Russian COVID-19 vaccine developers CanSino Biological and Gamaleya Institute also rely on this approach. The Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines use messenger RNA (mRNA) technology.,"The European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommends AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine, saying the benefits outweigh the risks. Several EU countries, however, have limited its use to certain age groups.","As of April 4, the EMA said 169 cases of CVST and 53 of splanchnic vein thrombosis had been reported after vaccination with the AstraZeneca shot.

J&J’s challenge to $2 billion talc judgment,"(Reuters) - The biggest corporate trade groups in the country are urging the U.S. Supreme Court in Johnson & Johnson v. Ingham to shut down what they contend to be the latest looming threat from the plaintiffs bar: consolidated trials involving 10, 20 or even more claimants in a single trial. As courts confront COVID-19 backlogs, the groups said, it’s going to be tempting to resort to mass trials – but these consolidated proceedings, they warned, encroach on defendants’ due process rights.","Fourteen pro-business, defense counsel and conservative public interest groups weighed in on Friday and Monday with amicus briefs backing J&J’s petition for Supreme Court review of a Missouri state appellate court decision that resulted in a $2.1 billion judgment against the company. The judgment against J&J arose from a 2018 trial featuring claims by 22 women who alleged that they developed ovarian cancer after using J&J talc products that contained asbestos.",SPECIAL REPORT: Johnson & Johnson knew for decades that asbestos lurked in its Baby Powder ,"J&J maintains there is no credible scientific evidence its talc products were contaminated or can be linked to ovarian cancer. But according to its Supreme Court petition, the company’s defense was undermined by the consolidated proceeding, in which jurors heard emotional testimony from the most sympathetic plaintiffs and endured five hours of jury instructions on the laws of all of the plaintiffs’ different home states. In J&J’s telling, instead of focusing on the specifics of cases by 22 plaintiffs who used different J&J products and had an array of cancer risk profiles and disease outcomes, jurors simply awarded each of the women $25 million in compensatory damages — and socked the company with billions of dollars in punitive damages, to boot.","That’s not a just or, indeed, constitutional outcome, according to J&J’s Supreme Court counsel at Hogan Lovells. The company’s March 2 petition presented three questions: whether a mass trial violates a defendant’s due process rights; whether a punitive damages award that far exceeds compensatory damages is a due process violation; and whether the Missouri courts erred in concluding that out-of-state plaintiffs could establish jurisdiction merely by showing that a J&J talc product was packaged in Missouri by an unrelated company. ","Consolidated jury trials involving claims by multiple defendants were once a regular feature of asbestos litigation, and much of the precedent J&J cites from state and federal courts that have curtailed multi-plaintiff jury trials comes from the days when courts were swamped with asbestos claims.","Mass trials are a rarer occurrence in recent years. The Product Liability Advisory Council, which represents 90 corporations, came up with only a few examples of recent consolidated trials in its amicus brief backing J&J, and each of those involved only four plaintiffs suing over pelvic mesh products.","J&J’s amici nevertheless warned the Supreme Court that COVID is going to give plaintiffs lawyers a new excuse to push for consolidated trials – which is why, they said, the Supreme Court must grant review of the J&J case. “The problem is likely to intensify if it is not urgently addressed,” argued a brief from a bevy of influential trade groups, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Business Roundtable, the National Association of Manufacturers and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America.","Several of J&J’s amici did highlight other issues. Two defense-lawyer groups, the Federation of Defense & Corporate Counsel and DRI-The Voice of the Defense Bar, honed in on the involvement of out-of-state plaintiffs in the J&J trial in Missouri, which the Federation’s counsel, Gallivan White & Boyd, called “a spectacular due process failure.” The Washington Legal Foundation, which describes itself as a free-enterprise public interest group, called for the Supreme Court to look at the punitive damages awarded against J&J, and the International Association of Defense Counsel focused on restricting plaintiffs’ alleged forum shopping.","But most of the corporate defense groups backing J&J seem to believe that the justices are most likely to be interested in whether mass trials compromise defendants’ due process rights. The brief by the Chamber and other groups, filed by Evan Trager of Mayer Brown, argued that mass trials compromise a defendant’s ability to make its case to the jury. When jurors hear causation evidence from dozens of plaintiffs, the brief argued, that sheer repetition is bound to create “false inference” of causation.","“The larger the cohort of plaintiffs, the more likely it becomes that the jurors will believe that it is simply ‘too much of a coincidence’ that every one of the plaintiffs used the product and then developed the disease,” the Chamber brief said. “That reasoning is scientifically unsound, but psychologically compelling when plaintiff after plaintiff conforms to the pattern.”","The Product Liability group, represented by Foley Hoag, cited a study comparing jury verdicts in multi-plaintiff asbestos trials in New York City between 2010 and 2014 with verdicts in trials involving just one plaintiff. Claimants in consolidated trials were vastly more likely to win, according to the brief – and to win big. The mean plaintiffs’ verdict in individual trials was about $9 million. In consolidated trials, the average plaintiff’s verdict was $23 million.","I emailed the plaintiffs’ Supreme Court counsel, Thomas Goldstein of Goldstein & Russell. He referred my query to plaintiffs’ lawyer Mark Lanier of The Lanier Law Firm, who said by email, “These time-worn amicus arguments attempt to rehash the trial on the merits. J&J still begs someone to buy their junk science and deceptive word games.”",J&J lawyers Neal Katyal and Sean Marotta declined to offer a statement on the amicus filings.,Plaintiffs have until May 5 to file a brief opposing Supreme Court review.,"The opinions expressed here are those of the author.

So far it has vaccinated roughly 260,000 people, out of 1.25 million health workers, health ministry data show.","The pace of vaccinations has been slow, with health experts, trade unions and businesses urging the government to ramp up vaccinations once more supplies become available.","The government is also expecting 20 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer, as well as supplies from the COVAX vaccine distribution scheme co-led by the World Health Organization and partners including the Gavi vaccines alliance.","A large clinical trial of J&J’s vaccine, which was conducted in eight countries including South Africa, showed the vaccine was 66% effective in preventing moderate to severe COVID-19 infection and 85% effective in stopping severe disease and hospitalization.","Pfizer’s vaccine was 100% effective in preventing symptomatic cases among trial participants in South Africa, the company said on Thursday, adding, however, that the rate was derived from a group of 800 participants, a relatively small sample."

That increase faces a shareholder vote at J&J’s annual general meeting on April 22, with some investors expressing displeasure, threatening to overshadow the company’s role in producing a vaccine for the coronavirus and the 30% share price rise over the past year.",Such pressure has led to at least one other company involved in the opioid lawsuit settlement discussions to reconsider its position. Drug distributor Cardinal Health Inc has said it will engage with shareholders to incorporate their views in its executive compensation plan after a minority of them revolted in November against a similar executive pay structure. A Cardinal Health spokesman did not respond to questions for details on any potential compensation changes.,"Illinois State Treasurer Michael Frerichs, who manages the state’s $38 billion investment portfolio that includes J&J shares, said the healthcare company’s “significant accomplishment” in producing a COVID-19 vaccine did not give it license to insulate executives from “costs and failures that happened under their watch.”","“Those foul-ups also need to be factored into the assessment,” he said, referring to executive pay. He declined to say how the Illinois fund would vote.","Michael Pryce-Jones, senior corporate governance analyst at the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, estimates Gorsky was paid an additional $4.4 million over the last two years as a result of the compensation structure. The Teamsters, a labor union, has affiliated funds with investments in J&J.",A J&J spokeswoman declined to comment on Pryce-Jones’ estimate or provide the company’s figures on the impact of the litigation on Gorsky’s pay. Gorsky did not respond to a request for comment.,"The J&J spokeswoman said that it was the healthcare company’s “longstanding and publicly disclosed practice” not to include certain non-recurring gains and expenses, such as litigation-related items, in the targets and results of its executives.

That increase faces a shareholder vote at J&J’s annual general meeting on April 22, with some investors expressing displeasure, threatening to overshadow the company’s role in producing a vaccine for the coronavirus and the 30% share price rise over the past year.",Such pressure has led to at least one other company involved in the opioid lawsuit settlement discussions to reconsider its position. Drug distributor Cardinal Health Inc has said it will engage with shareholders to incorporate their views in its executive compensation plan after a minority of them revolted in November against a similar executive pay structure. A Cardinal Health spokesman did not respond to questions for details on any potential compensation changes.,"Illinois State Treasurer Michael Frerichs, who manages the state’s $38 billion investment portfolio that includes J&J shares, said the healthcare company’s “significant accomplishment” in producing a COVID-19 vaccine did not give it license to insulate executives from “costs and failures that happened under their watch.”","“Those foul-ups also need to be factored into the assessment,” he said, referring to executive pay. He declined to say how the Illinois fund would vote. Michael Pryce-Jones, senior corporate governance analyst at the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, estimates Gorsky was paid an additional $4.4 million over the last two years as a result of the compensation structure. The Teamsters, a labor union, has affiliated funds with investments in J&J.",A J&J spokeswoman declined to comment on Pryce-Jones’ estimate or provide the company’s figures on the impact of the litigation on Gorsky’s pay. Gorsky did not respond to a request for comment.,"The J&J spokeswoman said that it was the healthcare company’s “longstanding and publicly disclosed practice” not to include certain non-recurring gains and expenses, such as litigation-related items, in the targets and results of its executives. Litigation items are included in the company’s total shareholder return and free cash flow, which determine other aspects of executive pay, she added.","Some governance experts stressed that J&J’s approach of compensating its chief executive without penalizing him for significant corporate liability exposure did not mean that shareholders would be worse off, given the management team’s other achievements such as the COVID-19 vaccine.","“A company of this size, facing a settlement of this magnitude, will manage (the cost of it) in such a way that there will not be an impact on investors,” said Ric Marshall, executive director in the environmental, social and governance (ESG) research team of MSCI Inc, the world’s largest financial index provider.","The Investors for Opioid & Pharmaceutical Accountability (IOPA), an advocacy group representing about 60 investors with a total of $4.2 trillion in assets under management, wrote to J&J’s board in January asking them to review their pay practices in light of the opioid litigation and agreed-to settlements, said Donna Meyer, director of shareholder advocacy at Mercy Investment Services Inc, which co-leads IOPA.

With Merck on board, we will be north of 2 billion,” he added, referring to a recent agreement for rival Merck & Co to produce J&J’s vaccine.",Stoffels also said he was confident J&J will be able to deliver a planned 55 million doses to the European Union in the second quarter. An EU official told Reuters this week that J&J had flagged possible supply issues that may complicate these plans.,"“We trust that we can deliver close to that amount in Q2,” Stoffels said, adding that final production steps would be the biggest challenge.","“It’s the fill and finish which was the critical part and there we learned we had later access, we started later and had later access to facilities,” he said.","J&J’s shot is the fourth to be endorsed for use in the EU after vaccines from Pfizer/BioNTech, AstraZeneca Plc and Moderna Inc.","Europe is scrambling to get immunization campaigns off the ground after an early supply shortfall from Pfizer, since resolved, and more persistent issues with AstraZeneca.",J&J’s vaccine is expected to be used widely around the globe because of its one-shot convenience and logistical advantage of being shipped and stored at normal refrigerator temperatures. Both the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines require two doses and must be shipped frozen.,"Thursday’s approval included authorization in Europe of Maryland-based Emergent Biosolutions Inc, which is making active drug substance for the vaccine.","“Emergent is a very critical supplier. It’s important for both the U.S. and Europe and other parts of the world,” Stoffels said, adding it can deliver enough drug substance for “up to a billion vaccines a year.”","Stoffels said in the United States, the company was only allowed to seek emergency use authorization for one manufacturing plant to produce drug substance.","Initial U.S. doses are being made at the company’s plant in Leiden, the Netherlands. J&J is awaiting U.S. approvals of the Emergent plant for drug substance, and for Catalent Inc, a contract manufacturer that will handle fill and finish from a new manufacturing line in Bloomington, Indiana.","Stoffels said as soon as J&J received U.S. authorization for the vaccine, U.S. regulators started reviewing the company’s additional production plants.",He said early “hiccups” have been resolved and the company expects to deliver on its promise of 100 million doses before the end of June.,"In Europe, Stoffels said the company plans to significantly scale up production of its Leiden plant. Additional capacity will come on board likely over the summer, he added.",Indian drugmaker Biological E Ltd will handle both drug substance and fill and finish for J&J’s vaccine. The company’s managing director told Reuters last month that Biological E was looking to contract manufacture roughly 600 million doses ofJ&J’s COVID-19 vaccine a year.,"Biological E is in the process of installing and validating equipment in the plant, which Stoffels said he expects to be ready in the second half of this year."

Pfizer and Moderna focused on efficacy against mild-to-moderate sickness, while J&J’s trial looked for efficacy against moderate-to-severe COVID-19.","J&J’s trial was conducted later and included significant numbers of participants in regions where highly transmissible new variants of the virus were circulating, potentially subjecting its shot to a more rigorous test.","Importantly, J&J’s vaccine was about as effective against severe illness and hospitalization as the other vaccines and, like the others, was 100% effective in preventing COVID-19-related death in the trial.","All three vaccines have a similar range of short-lived side effects, including fatigue, aches, injection site soreness, nausea and fever, mostly mild-to-moderate.","IF J&J’S SHOT IS LESS EFFECTIVE, WHY SHOULD I GET IT?",J&J’s vaccine is a single shot. Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines each require two shots three or four weeks apart.,"J&J’s shot is extremely effective at preventing people exposed to COVID-19 from getting severely ill or dying, as well as offering protection against milder cases.","“These vaccines are the path to getting your life back,” said Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. “These are vaccines you should not hesitate to get when offered.”",J&J’s vaccine is one of the few that has been tested in clinical trails against the worrisome virus variant first discovered in South Africa. It demonstrated an ability to provide protection against severe disease and death even for those infected with that variant. Pfizer and Moderna have only tested their vaccines against the variant in the lab and believe they will remain protective.,Experts say that for the next couple of months vaccine supplies will be too scarce for healthcare providers to offer a choice. Most vaccination sites will receive only one of the three vaccines at any given time.,"Patients who prefer a specific vaccine can ask healthcare providers which one they have on hand. Later in the year, greater availability of shots could result in more patient choice, but health experts strongly advise taking whichever vaccine you can get.",HOW MANY DOSES OF J&J’S NEW SHOT WILL BE AVAILABLE?,"J&J said it expects to ship nearly 4 million doses in the first week, and shipments could begin late Sunday or early Monday.",J&J expects to deliver a total of 20 million shots by the end of March and as many as 100 million doses by mid-year.,"The federal government, through distributor McKesson Corp, will ship J&J’s shots to states and territories around the United States. It will also deliver them to select pharmacies and community health centers to make sure they reach underserved populations.","Between J&J, Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, the United States is on track to receive 240 million doses by the end of March, enough to fully inoculate 130 million Americans. The drugmakers have agreed to send 700 million doses of their vaccines by the end of July, more than enough to vaccinate all Americans."

Shipments to vaccination sites are expected to begin Sunday or Monday.,"President Joe Biden hailed the move but cautioned Americans against celebrating too soon. “Things are still likely to get worse again as new variants spread,” he said in a statement, urging people to continue washing their hands, wearing masks, and maintaining social distancing.","“There is light at the end of the tunnel, but we cannot let our guard down now or assume that victory is inevitable,” he said.","Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, which are based on new messenger RNA technology, showed higher efficacy rates in pivotal trials that used two doses versus J&J’s single-shot vaccine. Direct comparison, however, is difficult because the trials had different goals and J&J’s was conducted while more contagious new variants of the virus were circulating.","“We believe that people should take the vaccine they are able to access,” the FDA’s acting commissioner, Dr. Janet Woodcock, said in a call after the authorization, noting the three vaccines had not been studied head-to-head.","“We feel that each of these vaccines will be effective, will prevent hospitalization, deaths and should be used,” she said.","In J&J’s 44,000-person global trial, the vaccine was found to be 66% effective at preventing moderate-to-severe COVID-19 four weeks after inoculation. It was 100% effective in preventing hospitalization and death due to the virus.","There were very few serious side effects reported in the trial, which also offered preliminary evidence that the vaccine reduced asymptomatic infections.",More study is expected. The FDA on Saturday dismissed the idea that evidence proved the vaccine prevented transmission between people and added there was no data to determine how long the vaccine’s protection lasted.,"J&J’s vaccine is expected to be used widely around the globe because it can be shipped and stored at normal refrigerator temperatures, making distribution easier than for the Pfizer/BioNTech SE and Moderna vaccines, which must be shipped frozen.","“It potentially could play a very substantial role if we have enough doses because it’s only a single-dose vaccine and that will make it attractive to people who are difficult to reach,” said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville. “It’s one and done.”","The U.S. government, which has purchased 100 million doses of the J&J vaccine, plans to distribute about 3 million to 4 million next week. That would be on top of the around 16 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines the government already planned to ship across the country.","“We are ready to roll it out,” White House senior adviser Andy Slavitt wrote on Twitter after the authorization. Johnson & Johnson said it had begun shipping vaccines to the government.","J&J plans to provide a total of 20 million doses by the end of March, which along with the more than 220 million total doses expected from Pfizer and Moderna would be enough to fully vaccinate 130 million Americans.","So far, the United States has distributed more than 90 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines, some of which have been used for second shots. About 14% of Americans have received at least one dose, according to U.S. government data.","COVID-19 has claimed more than half a million lives in the United States, and states are clamoring for more doses to stem cases, hospitalizations, and deaths.","Public health officials have warned about a rise in the prevalence of more contagious variants of the virus, adding to the urgency to get millions more people vaccinated as quickly as possible. Meanwhile, they said, mask wearing and other measures to curb the virus spread should remain in place as recent declines in COVID-19 cases appear to be leveling off.","The J&J vaccine is also under review by the European Union, where deliveries are expected starting in April and would build on the region’s thin supplies of the Pfizer/BioNTech, Moderna and AstraZeneca Plc shots.","In South Africa, regulators were awaiting the FDA decision as their government looks to deploy more J&J vaccine against a variant of the virus called B.1.351 that is able to evade some vaccine protection.","J&J’s vaccine is being rolled out there prior to official authorization for about 500,000 healthcare workers in a bid to stem infections from the variant, which has swept across the country and spread globally, including to the United States.",The vaccine is one of the few that has been tested in clinical trials against the variant and had a 64% efficacy rate at preventing moderate-to-severe disease in South Africa.,"J&J said on Friday that the company was developing a second-generation vaccine that would target the concerning South African variant, and it will be ready to start Phase I trials by this summer.","J&J’s vaccine uses a common cold virus known as adenovirus type 26 to introduce coronavirus proteins into cells in the body and trigger an immune response. J&J is testing a two-dose version of its vaccine, with results expected this summer."

(bit.ly/3cmnnk1; reut.rs/3opLsJe)",High antibody levels seen in newborns of COVID-19 survivors,"A mother's COVID-19 antibodies can cross the placenta, potentially protecting her fetus from infection, researchers reported on Friday in JAMA Pediatrics. Several weeks after the mother's infection begins, antibody levels in umbilical cord blood ""can be as high as - or even higher - than the levels in maternal blood,"" said study leaders Dr. Karen Puopolo and Dr. Scott Hensley of the University of Pennsylvania. In their study, out of 83 women who had COVID-19 antibodies when they gave birth, 72 of their newborns also had antibodies but no evidence of direct infection. ""It is reassuring that maternal infection, whether symptomatic or asymptomatic, results in sufficient antibody production for an efficient transplacental antibody transfer to newborns of infected mothers,"" said Dr. Flor Munoz of Baylor College of Medicine in an editorial published with the study. It is possible antibodies created via a vaccine could have the same effect, Munoz noted. Transfer of substances in the mother's blood to the fetus starts around 17 weeks of gestation, she said, which suggests that ""maternal vaccination starting in the early second trimester ... might be optimal to achieve the highest levels of antibodies in the newborn.""

Between April and October, an international registry established by dermatologists received reports of roughly 1,000 COVID-19 patients with itchy welts, rashes, scaly plaques, or pernio, an inflammation of the fingers and toes upon exposure to cold. In half of the cases, the skin problems lasted more than two weeks. That was more often true for patients with scaly plaques and pernio. Given that some of the patients had only mild COVID-19, the data suggest that inflammation from the disease may persist even among those who were not seriously ill, researchers said in The Lancet Infectious Diseases. ""Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, appreciation for persistent morbidity beyond the acute phase of disease has increased,"" they said.

To be approved by regulators, the J&J vaccine must show efficacy as reflected by a lower risk of infections and severe disease in study participants who receive it compared to those who do not. Efficacy data from a large late-stage trial on the vaccine is due by February.

But when people do get COVID-19 a second time, they often have no symptoms, and so they may still be able to carry the coronavirus in their nose and throat and unwittingly pass it on, the researchers wrote in a report published on Wednesday by Public Health England (PHE) ahead of peer review. Experts have said people who contracted COVID-19 in the pandemic's first wave may now be vulnerable to infection again. ""We now know that most of those who have had the virus, and developed antibodies, are protected from reinfection, but this is not total and we do not yet know how long protection lasts,"" said study leader Susan Hopkins, senior medical adviser at PHE in London. ""If you believe you already had the disease and are protected, you can be reassured it is highly unlikely you will develop severe infections. But there is still a risk you could acquire an infection and transmit (it) to others."" (bit.ly/3ihkuBZ; reut.rs/3ieWorA)",Coronavirus targets cells’ energy engines,"Researchers have discovered an important line of attack used by the novel coronavirus: it targets an infected cell's mitochondria. These tiny organelles not only generate the energy that powers a cell's biochemical reactions, but they also play important roles in immune function. ""We knew that when the virus attacks cells, bad things happen - but we didn't know why,"" said Dr. Pinchas Cohen of the University of Southern California, whose team published its findings this month in the journal Scientific Reports. ""Now we can say, when the virus attacks cells, it damages the mitochondria."" In test tube experiments, the researchers found that the virus caused ""dramatic changes and impairment"" in the genes that regulate mitochondrial function, Cohen told Reuters. The implication, Cohen said, is that energy production in the cells and so-called innate immunity - the body's first line of defense against germs - are then impaired. Another implication is that having healthy mitochondria would help people combat the virus if they do become infected. ""We know that a healthy diet and healthy lifestyle promote mitochondrial health,"" Cohen said, whereas mitochondrial function deteriorates with age and with many chronic conditions including diabetes and heart disease. In the future, Cohen added, researchers may develop COVID-19 interventions to help improve mitochondrial health. (go.nature.com/3bFlCyc)","‘Nanobody’ combos block coronavirus, even when it mutates","Combining small antibodies called nanobodies into single molecules to fight the novel coronavirus may be more effective than targeting it with conventional antibodies or single nanobodies, according to a new study. These ""multivalent"" nanobodies - containing multiple nanobody building blocks - ""are substantially better in neutralizing viruses"" and preventing them from breaking into cells, study leaders Florian Schmidt and Paul-Albert König of the University of Bonn told Reuters. The fused nanobodies ""help each other so that the outcome is better than just the sum of the two responses."" The nanobody constructs can target multiple sites on the coronavirus, making it harder for the pathogen to develop mutations that render treatment ineffective, according to a report published on Tuesday in the journal Science. While the researchers saw plenty of mutations that allowed the coronavirus to ""escape"" the effect of a single nanobody, ""we did not find any escape mutants that were able to replicate in the presence of those nanobodies that target two different surfaces at the same time,"" Schmidt and König said. A spin-off company of the University of Bonn, called DiosCURE, expects to start testing the combined nanobody molecules in people later this year.

The study is ongoing, but the protection has lasted 71 days so far.",Similar data in participants over age 65 will be available in late January.,"The study also evaluated the effect of two doses of the vaccine given 56 days apart, and found the booster led to more than double the level in neutralizing antibodies against the virus.","Side effects such as fever, muscle aches and injection site pain, were tolerable and resolved quickly.","Stoffels said the interim data, combined with monkey studies published in the summer showing strong protection against disease and transmission after a single dose, increased his confidence in the vaccine.","“The likelihood that we can now translate this into humans in our Phase III study hopefully is very high,” he said, adding, “We’ll see in a few weeks.”","Although J&J’s clinical trial protocols allowed for an early look at the data after 20 people became infected by the novel coronavirus, the company intends to deliver data on at least 154 confirmed cases - the target needed to fully assess the vaccine’s efficacy - when it releases results. That should come in the last week of January or the first week of February, Stoffels said.",The U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires at least two months of safety data on half of the study participants to ensure no unexpected side effects crop up. The company crossed that two-month threshold earlier this month.,"“That point came so close to the final analysis that we decided not to do an interim analysis,” Stoffels said.","J&J plans to seek emergency use authorization from the FDA based on the study of the vaccine as a single shot, Stoffels said.

J&J told Reuters in September that those hosting trials would have priority for vaccine supply.",Now some in government circles and the public health community fear those deals could be compromised. And local researchers have been left wondering whether they will be fully compensated for their investment in incomplete trials.,J&J has not provided details on where the cap in numbers would impact most. The company did not comment on the status of supply deals or on compensation arrangements for researchers.,"The drugmaker expects an initial analysis of the data by late January. If the trial proves successful, the company plans to seek U.S. authorization in February.","To date, none of the six countries in Latin America participating in the trial has finalized a vaccine supply agreement with J&J, even though they still do not have enough doses from other vaccine makers to inoculate all of their citizens. Health officials in all six countries said that negotiations were still in progress.","Albert Ko, professor of epidemiology at the Yale School of Public Health, who has extensive disease research experience in Latin America, said ensuring both rich and poor countries had good access to vaccines was a “key social justice issue for the world.”","“Countries in Latin America, as they are establishing trial sites, need to pressure for these deals when they are negotiating with the industry. But also it’s on the companies,” he said.","Ko cited the approach of AstraZeneca Plc to helping less wealthy nations produce and distribute its COVID-19 vaccine candidate, developed with Oxford University.",AstraZeneca’s vaccine is viewed as one of the best hopes for many developing countries because of its cheaper price and ability to be transported at normal fridge temperatures.,"J&J turned to Latin America when infection rates there spiked, as a way to accelerate testing of the vaccine and gauge its effectiveness in diverse populations. The drugmaker shared its plans for the region with Reuters in September, saying it aimed to enroll 20,000 participants in the six countries by November.","The J&J vaccine is easier to transport and store and is administered in a single shot, unlike vaccines from front-runners Pfizer Inc and Moderna Inc, which are delivered in two doses.",J&J has signed an agreement in principle to provide the COVAX vaccine program with up to 500 million doses of its vaccine through 2022 for distribution to lower income countries.,"“This vaccine would be a game changer because of that single dose, not just for Latin America but for Asia, South Asia, sub-Saharan Africa and much of the world,” said Ko. “Two doses is exponentially more difficult to administer. I would think countries would jump on this if a safe and effective one-dose vaccine comes onboard.”","Brazil has signed non-binding letters of intent to purchase vaccines from four companies including J&J, with health officials indicating a preference for the J&J single-dose shot.",Mexico’s Deputy Health Minister Hugo Lopez-Gatell said earlier this month at a news conference that hosting the Janssen trial would give the country priority access to the vaccine. Foreign secretary Marcelo Ebrard said last week Mexico could order 22 million doses under a memorandum of understanding.,The Mexican government declined to comment on the halting of trial recruitment and the likelihood now of a priority vaccine supply deal.,"A Peruvian government source told Reuters that new deals could be announced in the coming days, but declined to comment on which companies they could involve.","The source said that there were constant surprises in the fast-moving negotiations taking place between governments and pharmaceutical companies around the world in the race to lock in deals, with intense and regular back-and-forth around price, quantity, delivery times and contractual conditions.","“Things change so fast that I could tell you something now and tomorrow it will be outdated,” he said.","During a conference call that Janssen - J&J’s pharmaceuticals division - convened with scientists from 100 Latin American trial sites on Dec. 9, local researchers, who had been working at full speed to help the company meet its ambitious goals, voiced their anger at the sudden announcement they should now wrap up their operations when their target volunteer numbers were not yet met and they had hundreds of people scheduled to be screened and vaccinated, according to two participants.","J&J in the statement issued on Friday expressed “its thanks to all participants, trial sites and health care professionals involved in the ENSEMBLE study.” It did not comment on the angry reaction over the conference call.","In all, the Latin American sites appear to have enrolled about 16,000 people, according to a Reuters tally of figures reported by trial leaders and governments.","Any shortfall would be meaningful for individual research sites, who are paid based on the number of people they recruit. Reuters could not determine the range of what researchers are paid, which varies depending on a number of factors, including their specific locations, third-party partners and target size of trials.","The urgency to sign people up quickly was evident at a site in Colina, Chile, late November, where a Reuters journalist was among the dozens of volunteers who moved along the queue in a narrow waiting room.","Most of those volunteering were medical workers, the worst-hit by the pandemic, and their families. Trial staff also signed up their own families and friends to help make their numbers, they told Reuters.","The start of trials in Chile, Peru and Mexico were delayed by several weeks, held up by factors like regulatory scrutiny, technical glitches and a scramble to get supplies.","In Brazil, the effort began without a hitch in October, with people from all walks of life taking part, said a researcher.","“There were thousands who volunteered. People are very enthusiastic to help and put up with long waits,” said Eduardo Vasconcellos, trial leader at the L2iP clinical research institute in Brasilia.","Alejandra Camino, a trial investigator at privately-run DIM health clinics in the Argentine capital Buenos Aires, said that, although the abrupt end to enrollment was not ideal, it was important to remain flexible in the fight against COVID-19.","“It’s a disappointment because if you set it up and found a venue, your operation is now going to be out of pocket,” she said of her colleagues’ work on their trials. “But we are talking about a pandemic.”"

He added that the company was likely to favour a single-jab approach, although a final decision on whether a booster would be needed had not yet been made.","Outcomes of large-scale, or Phase III, trials will depend on the incidence of infections, Van Hoof said, with faster results expected with higher virus transmission.","That is why J&J is likely to conduct those trials in the United States and Latin America, the world’s regions currently with the highest number of cases.","If infections drop significantly, J&J is also considering so-called challenge trials, in which volunteers are infected with the virus so that a vaccine candidate can be tested on them.","“We are looking into that possibility,” Van Hoof said, noting though that such trials posed ethical issues that needed to be resolved before they could be conducted. For instance, an effective therapy against the disease should be available to minimise risks for volunteers exposed to the virus.","In May British drugmaker AstraZeneca AZN.L, which is developing a leading coronavirus vaccine with Oxford University, said it was too early to deliberately expose trial participants to the pathogen, but that may become an option if ongoing tests hit a snag.",Van Hoof said that preparations to stock the virus for possible challenge trials were already underway and J&J was part of ongoing discussions with universities and other bodies involved in these projects.,"“We find it a very interesting idea,” he said, adding however, that setting up facilities for such trials would perhaps take longer than testing vaccines on people who are already infected in the community - as long as transmission remained relatively high."

But in a pandemic a single-shot vaccine has a significant advantage, sidestepping a lot of the logistical issues involved in getting people to come back for their second dose.",The company plans to take up the question of one or two doses in its phase 1 trial.,"Depending on those results, J&J plans to start large-scale, phase 3 testing with a single-shot regimen in the second half of September. Around the same time, the company will start a parallel phase 3 study testing a two-shot regimen of the vaccine, Stoffels said.","“The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is exciting because it’s a single dose,” White House Coronavirus Task Force Coordinator Deborah Birx said in an interview with Fox News.","Having one dose “show protection in monkeys like the other vaccines have shown with two doses does shorten the time period for development because your readout becomes 30 days quicker,” she said.","J&J’s vaccine uses a common cold virus known as adenovirus type 26, or Ad26, to ferry coronavirus proteins into cells in the body, causing the body to mount an immune defense against the virus.","In the monkey study, scientists from J&J and Harvard’s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center studied seven different potential vaccines in 32 animals and compared the results to 20 control animals who got placebo shots.","Six weeks later, all of the animals were exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus. All 20 animals that received the placebo developed high levels of virus in their lungs and nasal swabs.","In the best-performing candidate, which J&J selected for human testing, none of the animals had virus in their lungs and only one showed low levels of virus in nasal swabs. Lab tests showed they all had developed antibodies capable of neutralizing the virus after a single shot.","“This study shows that even just a single immunization with the Ad26 vaccine leads to neutralizing antibody responses and robust protection of monkeys against COVID-19,” said Dr. Dan Barouch, a vaccine researcher at Beth Israel Deaconness who led the research in collaboration with J&J.",J&J shares were up nearly 2% at $149.93 before the market open on Thursday.

A vaccine is seen as essential to ending the pandemic that has infected more than 7.2 million people and killed over 412,000 globally, while battering economies worldwide.",J&J initially expected safety trials to start in September. Chief Scientific Officer Paul Stoffels told Reuters the company has been working closely with its U.S. government partners to accelerate that timeline.,"“Based on the strength of the preclinical data we have seen so far and interactions with the regulatory authorities, we have been able to further accelerate the clinical development,” Stoffels said in a statement on Wednesday.","J&J’s study will test the vaccine for safety and early signs of efficacy in 1,045 healthy volunteers aged 18 to 55 years, and in those aged 65 and older. The trial will take place in the United States and Belgium.","The company is also in talks with the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases(NIAID) to start larger, late-stage trials ahead of schedule, depending on results of the early studies and regulatory approval.","The United States is planning to test a handful of coronavirus vaccine candidates in trials that will enroll up to 30,000 subjects with the aim of getting an answer on efficacy as quickly as possible. National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Francis Collins told Reuters that companies will need to complete their safety trials by the end of summer to be included in those studies.",Stoffels said last week that J&J hopes to have results of its vaccine efficacy trials in the first quarter of 2021. He added that the company is “working hard to bring it back to the end of the year.”,"A lot will depend on how much virus is circulating at that time, he said.","“If you have an incidence of 1% a year versus 4% a year, it’s totally different. And that’s where these trials are so unpredictable,” he said referring to the percentage of new cases occurring in the population at the time.","The company plans to test the vaccine in high-transmission regions within the United States. If the incidence is low, “we will complement that with international sites to make sure that we reach enough endpoints quickly to prove the vaccine works,” Stoffels said.","Moderna Inc, which is working in close partnership with NIAID, has started testing its vaccine candidate in a 600-subject mid-stage trial. The company expects to begin late-stage trials in July.","Moderna’s vaccine uses messenger RNA technology, an approach that has yet to produce any approved vaccines. J&J is utilizing the same technology used to make its Ebola vaccine, which won European regulatory approval late last month.","There are about 10 coronavirus vaccines in human testing.

Talc - which is sometimes found in the same rock as asbestos, a potent carcinogen - is used in thousands of cosmetic and personal care products to absorb moisture, prevent caking and add softness.","Thousands of cancer lawsuits, some dating back to 2013, have been filed against body-powder market leader Johnson & Johnson . Allegations that asbestos contamination caused plaintiffs’ cancers began in 2017. Other makers of talc powders also face suits, including Revlon, Chanel and Avon, securities filings and court records show.",Scrutiny of talc products intensified after a 2018 Reuters investigation here reported that J&J knew for decades that asbestos lurked in its talc and powders. The company has disputed Reuters’ report and maintains its powders are safe and asbestos free.,"J&J announced last month that it would stop selling talc Baby Powder in the United States and Canada, attributing the decision to declining sales and negative publicity.","In March, a Chanel representative disclosed in a court deposition that in 2017 the company had stopped making a talc-based body powder, scented with its iconic No. 5 fragrance that it had made since 1924. The deposition was taken in a 2018 case filed in a Los Angeles court. In it, a California woman alleges she got mesothelioma, in part from asbestos-tainted Chanel and J&J powders she used for decades.","Asbestos is the only well established cause of mesothelioma, an incurable rare cancer of the lining of the lungs and other organs.",Chanel representative Amy Wyatt said in the deposition that Chanel was sued for the first time over its talc powder in 2016 and she denied Chanel powders contained asbestos.,"“We know that it was a safe product,” Wyatt said in the deposition. But “we determined from public perception to remove it from the market.”","Wyatt said Chanel had also removed talc from its loose face powder, but she was not sure when the new formulation would be on the market. She did not say what the talc was replaced with.","Chanel told Reuters that it routinely updates its products “to ensure we continue to meet our customers’ changing needs and expectations,” a spokeswoman said in an email.","Chanel, which continues to use talc in other products including pressed powder, blush and eye shadow, said all the talc it uses is “selected according to strict purity criteria, fully complies with current global regulations, and is safe under standard conditions of cosmetic use.”",The privately held company did not respond to questions about the deposition or litigation.,A Revlon spokesman told Reuters the company removed talc from its body products. He declined to say when or why; he also declined to comment on litigation.,L’Oreal said it is looking for a talc replacement but has not found anything that works as well.,"“Well known partial alternatives exist, and we continue to explore and seriously consider performant alternatives,” a spokeswoman told Reuters in an email. “But none meet the same performance for our products.”","L’Oreal - like other companies - requires its suppliers to certify annually that its talc is asbestos-free, and it does in-house testing, she said.","“We have not detected any trace of asbestos in any of our raw materials containing more than 20% talcum powder,” L’Oreal’s spokeswoman said.","Other personal care companies have also stopped selling talc powder. Germany’s Beiersdorf said it switched to corn starch in its Nivea baby powder in 2018. Bausch Health changed the formula of its Shower to Shower powder in 2018 “to keep the product in line with market trends and customer preferences,” and not because of safety concerns, a spokeswoman said.","Bausch, which last sold talc powder in February 2019, has been named in 165 lawsuits; 12 are pending, securities filings show.","Avon, which declined to comment, said in a securities filing that 128 lawsuits were pending against it over talc products.","Sanofi, maker of Gold Bond powder, told Reuters it stood by the safety of its talc powder and was “vigorously” contesting talc lawsuits against it.","“Sanofi will continue to evaluate its product offerings in light of supply and consumer demand,” a spokesman said.","Globally, consumers are expected to purchase 139,350 tonnes of talc this year, down 0.6 percent from last year, according to Euromonitor International.","Last year, during an analysis of 52 talc-containing cosmetic products, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration found asbestos in nine products, including three sold by tween retailer Claire’s and one bottle of Johnson’s Baby Powder. All products were voluntarily recalled.","A spokeswoman said Claire’s had stopped using talc, and replaced it with mica in most of its products.","The FDA is analyzing 50 more samples this year and is considering establishing an asbestos testing standard. Canada’s Health Ministry tentatively concluded in 2018 that talc itself may cause lung problems if inhaled, and ovarian cancer if used in the genital area. A final decision, expected next year, could lead to a ban or restriction on the use of talc in certain products in Canada."

Many are pending before a U.S. district judge in New Jersey.","“I wish my mother could be here to see this day,” said Crystal Deckard, whose mother Darlene Coker alleged Baby Powder caused her mesothelioma. She dropped the suit filed in 1999 after losing her fight to compel J&J to divulge internal records. Coker died of the cancer in 2009.","In its statement, J&J said it “remains steadfastly confident in the safety of talc-based Johnson’s Baby Powder,” citing “decades of scientific studies.”",J&J has faced intense scrutiny of the safety of its baby powder following an investigative report by Reuters here in 2018 that found the company knew for decades that asbestos lurked in its talc.,"Internal company records, trial testimony and other evidence show that from at least 1971 to the early 2000s, the company's raw talc and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos. (here)",The Reuters article prompted a stock selloff that erased about $40 billion from J&J’s market value in one day and created a public relations crisis as the healthcare conglomerate faced widespread questions about the possible health effects of one of its most well-known products.,"J&J has also been the target of a federal criminal investigation into how forthright it has been about its talc products’ safety, an investigation by 41 states into its baby powder sales, which it disclosed in April, and an investigation into health risks of asbestos in talc-containing consumer products by a Congressional subcommittee.","U.S. Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, who led the Congressional inquiry, described J&J’s decision to stop selling talc baby powder as “a major victory for public health”.","“My Subcommittee’s 14-month investigation revealed that Johnson & Johnson knew for decades that its product contains asbestos,” he said.","In response to evidence of asbestos contamination presented in media reports, in the court room and on Capitol Hill, J&J has repeatedly said its talc products are safe, and do not cause cancer.",The company said on Tuesday that its decision to discontinue talc-based Baby Powder in North America was not connected to any of those investigations.,"Apart from the baby powder controversy the company, one of the most trusted brands in America, more recently has faced a series of legal and reputational challenges.","J&J has said it has been named as a defendant, along with other drugmakers, in more than 2,900 lawsuits alleging the companies improperly promoted addictive opioids.","In August, an Oklahoma judge rendered the first verdict in that litigation, ordering J&J to pay $572.1 million to the state for its part in fueling an opioid epidemic by deceptively marketing addictive painkillers.",J&J is appealing the Oklahoma judge’s ruling and has denied it caused the opioid crisis.,"The company said on Tuesday said it had stopped shipping talc baby powder when the COVID-19 crisis led to limits on shopping and manufacturing, and that now it would wind down North American sales.","“Demand for talc-based Johnson’s Baby Powder in North America has been declining due in large part to changes in consumer habits and fueled by misinformation around the safety of the product and a constant barrage of litigation advertising,” it said in a statement.","Sold continuously since 1894, Johnson’s Baby Powder now accounts for only about 0.5% of its U.S. consumer health business, the company said. But it remains a symbol of the company’s family-friendly image.","An internal J&J marketing presentation from 1999 refers to the baby products division, with Baby Powder at the core, as J&J’s “#1 Asset,” grounded in “deep, personal trust” and a 2003 internal memo described it as a “sacred cow,” Reuters reported.","Christie Nordhielm, a professor of marketing at Georgetown, said it appears J&J made its decision to withdraw from the market while consumers were preoccupied with the pandemic. “It’s a nice time to quietly do it,” she said, adding “it will minimize the reputational hit.”",Shares of J&J were up 0.35% at $149.31 on Wednesday morning after the disclosure.,"“We will continue to vigorously defend the product, its safety, and the unfounded allegations against it and the Company in the courtroom,” Johnson & Johnson said. “All verdicts against the company that have been through the appeals process have been overturned.”",‘STEP IN RIGHT DIRECTION’,"Krystal Kim, one of 22 women with ovarian cancer whose case in St. Louis resulted in a 2018 jury verdict of $4.69 billion against J&J, said the decision to discontinue the products was “a step in the right direction.” J&J has appealed that verdict.","Nevertheless, J&J’s legal challenges likely will continue, some lawyers said.","In April, a New Jersey judge ruled that thousands of plaintiffs who allege J&J’s talc products caused cancer can go forward with their claims, but face limits on what expert testimony would be allowed in trials.","“Just taking it off the shelf today doesn’t end the litigation by a long shot,” said Loyola Law Professor Adam Zimmerman.","Asbestos is known to cause cancer that emerges decades after exposure. Cases involving asbestos-containing products removed from the marketplace long ago “continue to be litigated very actively to this day,” Zimmerman said.","Alexandra Lahav, a law professor at the University of Connecticut, said J&J’s decision could help the company reduce the amount of punitive damages by jurors in future trials, however, as those awards are frequently driven by jurors’ desire to punish a company’s ongoing conduct.","J&J said it will continue to sell cornstarch-based baby powder in North America, and will sell both its talc and cornstarch-based products in other markets around the world."

The agency told Reuters it also plans to spend an unnamed amount to ramp up manufacturing for Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate.,Moderna shares rose 1.4% to $30.48.,"BARDA ultimately plans to support five or six experimental vaccine candidates, with the hopes of having two or three successful ones, BARDA director Rick Bright said in a phone interview.",Experts have estimated it could be 12 to 18 months before a safe and effective vaccine wins regulatory approval.,"“Government and industry is working in unprecedented ways,” Bright said. The hope is to work “as quickly as possible and manufacture enough of it for us and the rest of the world in a very short timeframe.”","The agency plans to take over manufacturing of Moderna’s vaccine candidate to enable the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based biotech to focus on testing it in larger trials.","BARDA hopes to speed up the back end of the vaccine manufacturing process, which involves ensuring that they are made and packaged according to standards set by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.",‘A LOT OF RISK INVOLVED’,"There are dozens of coronavirus vaccines in development, according to the World Health Organization. But it is still not clear that people develop lasting immunity to this virus, or what it will take for a vaccine to be protective.","“What you need to do is take an assessment of what the most likely candidates are and invest at risk in those,” said Seth Berkley, chief executive of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization (GAVI).","The earlier you make that decision, the more likely you are to have manufacturing in place, but the less confident you are about whether the vaccine will work, Berkley said.","Typically, decisions on whether to move forward with a vaccine are made after safety trials and preliminary efficacy trials have been completed.","J&J said it will begin human testing in September, with an eye toward having a vaccine ready under an emergency use authorization in early 2021.","J&J Chief Scientific Officer Dr. Paul Stoffels told Reuters the company had to start ramping up manufacturing capacity now, even before it has a signal that its experimental vaccine candidate works.","“That is the only option for us to get it on time,” Stoffels said of the early 2021 target.

Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of stroke more than fivefold, according to the American Heart Association.","Jeff Williams, Apple’s chief operating officer, said the initial study proved the Apple Watch can detect atrial fibrillation with a low rate of false alarms, which helped Apple gain clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for a watch app that takes an electrocardiogram, or EKG, measurement. The study with J&J aims to show if early detection leads to better health outcomes.","“We want to follow the science all the way to the end, no matter what the outcomes are, and run this longitudinal study,” Williams told Reuters in an interview. “It’s not something that we have to do, but it’s the right thing to do.”","The joint effort, called “Heartline,” is significant because J&J is one of the world’s largest medical device makers and pharmaceutical companies.","“What we bring is clinical study capability on a very large scale,” said Paul Stoffels, J&J’s chief scientific officer, who said the study aims to track 150,000 participants with long-term follow-ups over two years.","The study could also reach a different population than Apple’s original heart study, which included 400,000 participants but faced questions from medical experts because more than half of the people who signed up were under 40, a group already at low risk for atrial fibrillation.","J&J targeted the study at population with a higher risk. Paul Burton, vice president of medical affairs at the J&J subsidiary running the study, said 70% of patients experiencing the condition are over 65.","“What we’re trying to do here is definitively answer that question: If you take wearable technology and couple it with an app, can you reduce the risk of a stroke or death?” Burton said.","The J&J study will be open to the more than 40 million people enrolled in traditional Medicare plans, which cover people aged 65 and older as well as the disabled. Study participants will be randomly assigned to either use only an iPhone app or use the app in conjunction with a watch capable of taking an EKG.","If patients who enroll are assigned to the arm of the study using the Apple Watch, they will be prompted to acquire one of the devices, which study officials said the participants can either purchase on their own for personal use for $49 or borrow free of charge for the study.",The latest Apple Watch model starts at list price of $399. Burton said J&J and Apple were sharing the cost of subsidizing the watches.,"The study will pay participants, who must agree to share their Medicare claims data. Apple and J&J officials said that was key to proving whether the use of the app and watch lead to reduced stroke risk.","“With tens of millions of watches on people’s wrists and us delivering this early detection, we have a huge responsibility to make sure that early detection is effective and really helping people with their health in the long haul,” Apple’s Williams told Reuters."

The plaintiffs are clearly going to say this lab director worked for J&J for years, and he found asbestos so there must be asbestos there.”","J&J’s challenge now is to discredit the single test result as erroneous without undermining the reputation and track record of its expert witness, Ausness said.","“J&J could try to frame it as not so much this lab director is unreliable or incompetent, but false positives do happen and additional tests are called for,” Ausness said.","The company appeared to do just that on Tuesday, saying testing done by other laboratories J&J hired had found no asbestos in the same bottle of Baby Powder tested by Saldivar for the FDA, nor in the lot of Baby Powder recalled as a result of Saldivar’s finding.","In an interview with Reuters on Tuesday, FDA officials said they stood by the AMA lab and its results. They also said they were not surprised by J&J’s findings because contaminants are not uniformly dispersed throughout talc and different testing methods can yield varying results.","The company “would say the product is free of asbestos based on their testing, and we would say the opposite for that sample,” said Steve Musser, deputy director for scientific operations in FDA’s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition.","Plaintiffs’ attorneys said Saldivar’s finding for the FDA could be detrimental to J&J’s defense in court. The company faces lawsuits from more than 16,000 people alleging that asbestos in its powders caused cancer.",The impact was immediate in one courtroom.,"Hours after J&J disclosed the FDA’s asbestos finding on Oct. 18, a plaintiff’s lawyer, Nate Finch, asked an Indianapolis judge to let him tell the jury about it in a trial involving a 71-year-old woman who alleged that Baby Powder contributed to her cancer.","J&J’s lawyers opposed the request, arguing that the information could prejudice the jury against the company, but the judge granted Finch’s request. Days later, Finch told the judge his client had come to a confidential resolution with J&J, a trial transcript shows. Finch told Reuters he could not comment on the resolution.","J&J did not respond to questions about the Indianapolis case. The company declined to comment on Saldivar’s role in the FDA testing, or on how it might affect the company’s legal strategy going forward.",Saldivar declined to comment.,"In a June deposition, Saldivar said J&J lawyers had retained him in 2017 as a company expert in “maybe 20 or 30” cases. His firm bills $200 to $350 an hour for his services, he testified.","Under the FDA contract, his lab found asbestos fibers in the Baby Powder sample on Sept. 7, according to the lab’s report. J&J said it was notified of the finding by FDA officials on Oct. 16, prompting the company to recall 33,000 bottles “out of an abundance of caution.”","In response, some major U.S. retailers have said they are removing all 22-ounce bottles of Johnson’s baby powder from their shelves.","At the same time, the company has expressed suspicions about the finding, saying it had launched its own investigation “to determine the integrity of the tested sample, and the validity of the test results.”","On Friday, the FDA posted online Saldivar’s 16-page report to the agency on the analysis of J&J Baby Powder. In samples weighing less than a gram, the lab said it found six chrysotile asbestos fibers. Given that the samples were extremely small, the asbestos could amount to millions of fibers per gram, testing experts told Reuters.","While most people exposed to asbestos never develop cancer, for some, even small amounts are enough to trigger the disease years later. Just how small hasn’t been established. The World Health Organization and other health authorities recognize no safe level of exposure to asbestos, a known carcinogen.","“Since there are no known safe levels of asbestos, the FDA has asked manufacturers to voluntarily recall their products when fibers consistent with asbestos are found in them,” the agency said this month.","Several juries over the past two years have concluded that Baby Powder exposures caused cancer and have awarded plaintiffs more than $5 billion. Other juries have sided with J&J, and some cases have settled.",‘JUST NOT CORRECT’,"The FDA has never before announced that government testing found asbestos in J&J’s Baby Powder. Since the early 1970s, J&J has pushed back hard on reports of asbestos in its talc by outside scientists, plaintiffs’ experts and, on several occasions, by its own testing labs.","In an Oct. 3 deposition in a New York lawsuit, J&J Chief Executive Alex Gorsky dismissed the findings of asbestos over the years, saying “they were later shown to be inaccurate, incomplete and just not correct.”","Attacking Saldivar’s finding, some legal experts told Reuters, could hurt the company’s ability to use him as a witness in lawsuits and undercut its broader message to jurors and consumers. That message boils down to: Trust our experts.","But a product liability defense lawyer who helped organize a recent talc litigation symposium said the impact on pending cases could be limited because asbestos-related cancers are known to take decades to develop. The FDA’s new finding “would be difficult to tie” to cancers allegedly caused by long-ago exposures, said Edward Ulloa, a Los Angeles-based lawyer who does not represent J&J.","The FDA findings are “essentially anecdotal,” Ulloa said, “specific to that product and that particular sample.”","In its Tuesday announcement, J&J said that one of the labs it hired initially found asbestos in three samples of Baby Powder, but the lab determined that a portable air conditioner running when the samples were prepared was contaminated with asbestos. Subsequent tests in a different room found no asbestos, the company said.","In 2010, when the AMA lab tested 34 talc products for the FDA, including Johnson’s Baby Powder, the lab had no experience looking for asbestos fibers in talc milled for powders and cosmetics.","Saldivar testified in several depositions that the lab’s work had previously focused on determining the amount of asbestos in old building products, such as vinyl flooring.","AMA made fast work of the 2010 FDA job, lab records reviewed by Reuters show. His lab examined 102 samples, three from each product, in a single day, using a method called transmission electron microscopy (TEM). That works out to less than five minutes per sample, assuming an eight-hour shift with no breaks.","Experts who have found asbestos in milled talc powders told Reuters they require anywhere from a half hour to a day per sample using TEM, and litigation records show they often look at more talc per sample than Saldivar has testified is the practice at AMA.","In a deposition earlier this year, Saldivar acknowledged that he looked at less talc per sample than others in the field and that looking at more talc “would raise your analytical sensitivity” - the ability to find any contamination. But he said he believed that his methods were sufficient.","After the AMA lab found no asbestos in 2010, the FDA cautioned against reading too much into the results - not because of the sensitivity of the test but because so few products were tested.","Though the agency has described the testing as using the “most sensitive techniques available,” it said the results “do not prove that most or all talc or talc-containing cosmetic products currently marketed in the United States are likely to be free of asbestos contamination.”","When J&J’s lawyers approached Saldivar a few years ago about serving as an expert and testing Baby Powder, they “wanted me to follow my protocols that I used on my FDA testing” in 2010, Saldivar testified in May 2018. In June, he testified that his lab had never found any asbestos in talc samples, including Baby Powder, that it had tested for J&J and other manufacturer defendants.",The testing by Saldivar’s lab for the FDA this year was a different story.,"“This positive test turns up the heat on J&J,” said Nora Freeman Engstrom, a Stanford University law professor who studies complex litigation. “And their expert lit the match.”"

The deposition has not been previously reported.","Gorsky, citing “thousands of tests and studies” to support his testimony, said: “I’m not aware of our baby powder or talc containing asbestos.”","That’s harder for him to say now. Last Wednesday, just 13 days after his deposition, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration told the healthcare giant it had discovered asbestos, a known carcinogen, in a bottle of Johnson’s Baby Powder.","On Friday, a day after getting the full FDA test results, J&J recalled 33,000 bottles of Baby Powder in the United States. It marked the first time the company has recalled Baby Powder for possible asbestos contamination and the first time U.S. regulators have announced finding asbestos in the product.","The recall is the latest blow to a healthcare conglomerate that has for many years tried to project an image as a caring company. It is now facing thousands of lawsuits over a variety of products, including legal action by more than 15,000 consumers claiming its talc powders caused their cancers.","Shares in J&J, which in February said it had received subpoenas from the U.S. Justice Department and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for documents related to the asbestos contamination allegations, dropped almost 6% on Friday after the recall was announced. The inquiries include a criminal grand jury investigation into how forthright J&J has been about the safety of its powders, according to people familiar with the matter.","In the deposition, Gorsky was pressed again and again to say - without qualification - that the company’s powders were asbestos free. But in answering questions under oath for the first time in the talc litigation, he stuck to his statement that he “believed” J&J’s powders were clean.","The FDA finding will make it much more difficult for Gorsky and the company to continue saying that they “believe” the talc powders are free from asbestos, said Elizabeth Burch, a product liability expert at the University of Georgia School of Law. She said the test result and recall lend credibility to what plaintiffs have been arguing in court for months.",J&J stands behind the safety of its talc and said it’s investigating the FDA test result. The company said it proceeded with the recall “out of an abundance of caution.”,"In a statement on Sunday J&J said: “Thousands of tests over the past 40 years repeatedly confirm that our consumer talc products do not contain asbestos, including prior tests by the FDA as recently as last month.”","In a written response to questions from Reuters on Monday, J&J added that Gorsky had no knowledge of the FDA finding of asbestos at the time of his deposition.",The company also said the FDA notified it on Sept. 20 that a test of its Baby Powder did not find any asbestos. Neither had the regulator detected asbestos during testing in 2010 using the “most sophisticated testing techniques available.”,Gorsky’s testimony echoed statements he made after Reuters on Dec. 14 last year published an investigation that found J&J knew for decades asbestos lurked in its talc.,"Internal company records, trial testimony and other evidence show that from at least 1971 to the early 2000s, the company’s raw talc and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos, the Reuters investigation found. Company executives, mine managers, scientists, doctors and lawyers fretted over the problem and how to address it, while failing to disclose it to regulators or the public.","Jim Kramer, the lawyer who deposed Gorsky this month, said he plans to ask the New York state judge in the case to allow him to question the CEO a second time in light of the FDA’s findings and the recall.",J&J declined to comment on the possibility of a second round with Kramer or about its legal strategy following the FDA test result.,"Gorsky faces at least one more deposition, this one ordered by a Missouri judge for Baby Powder cancer cases pending in that state. That has yet to be scheduled.","In his daylong videotaped deposition, Gorsky, a former Army Ranger, recounted his efforts to stem the growing controversy over one of the company’s signature products.","Sitting at the head of a conference table with the blinds drawn in the midtown Manhattan offices of a mediation firm, he testified that J&J considered dropping talc powders.","“We had discussions internally along the way regarding should we leave … talc on the market or not,” Gorsky said at the deposition.","In the end, however, Gorsky said the company, which also sells Baby Powder made from cornstarch, stuck with talc because it was confident about its safety and because many consumers liked its feel.","“We had the right testing procedures in place and so there was … no medical reason or safety reason to withdraw it,” he testified.","“There were in fact differences between cornstarch and talc-based baby powder in its feel, in its absorbency,” said Gorsky, who has been J&J’s CEO since 2012. The company “felt it was important to have different options on the market based upon different consumer needs.”","The plaintiff’s lawyer pressed the 59-year-old Gorsky on his use of the word “believe” when asked about asbestos in J&J’s talc. “My follow up is,” Kramer said, “can you not answer the question as I’ve presented it with a yes or a no?”","Gorsky, who said in the deposition he uses Johnson’s Baby Powder and had also used it on his son, didn’t budge. “I did not personally conduct every single test. I can only … gauge it based upon the data and totality that’s been presented to me.”","In its answers to Reuters questions on Monday, the company reiterated that “Mr. Gorsky is not a scientist and did not conduct the tests. He therefore relies on others to advise him.”","Before the FDA test result, Gorsky’s focus on what he “believed” to be true was helpful to J&J’s legal position, said Andrew Bradt, a Berkeley Law professor at the University of California. Many state laws require plaintiffs to prove companies knew a product was defective, and if Gorsky had unequivocally said talc does not contain asbestos then opposing lawyers could seek to undermine his declaration by contrasting it with the results of tests J&J knew about over the years suggesting otherwise.","However, in light of the FDA asbestos discovery, plaintiff lawyers could now make it sound like he was being hesitant in his deposition, Bradt said.",‘MAD MONEY’,Much of the testimony centered on Gorsky’s efforts to quell public and investor concerns raised by the Dec. 14 Reuters investigation and a story published hours later in the New York Times. The Reuters report had prompted a stock selloff that erased about $40 billion from the company’s market value in one day.,"In the subsequent days, J&J tweeted, posted on Facebook, ran a series of full-page newspaper ads, published a lengthy rebuttal to the Reuters investigation on its website and announced a $5 billion stock buyback.","In video posted in December and still featured on J&J’s website, Gorsky emphasized that regulators “have always found our talc to be asbestos free.”","Jim Cramer, the host of the CNBC investing show “Mad Money,” gave Gorsky the chance to present his side of the story last December, according to copies of emails shown at the deposition.","Hours after the Reuters and New York Times articles were published, Cramer sent a message to Gorsky’s work email, saying: “Dear Alex, if you feel these talc stories are not truthful, I would love to know how to refute them! – all the best, Jim.”","And that evening, Cramer sent a followup: “Thank you, Alex. Do not be afraid to overwhelm me. I will work all weekend to tell the truth about your great company!!! -Jim.”","Gorsky appeared in person in the “Mad Money” studio the following Monday, Dec. 17.","“We want to make sure that our trust and integrity that we’ve earned over the last 130 years is maintained for the next 130 years,” he told viewers.","“We unequivocally believe that our talc, our Baby Powder, does not contain asbestos,” Gorsky said on the broadcast.","In an email to Reuters, Cramer said his goal “was to get Alex Gorsky on CNBC first and to ask all the toughest questions … There were no ground rules and nothing was off the table.” At the end of the Dec. 17 broadcast, there was a disclosure that Cramer’s charitable trust owned J&J shares.","It still has a stake today, Cramer said.","When the question of previous test results came up in the deposition, Gorsky said occasional findings of asbestos in talc haven’t held up under scrutiny. Such tests were subsequently found to be “incomplete or inaccurate,” he said.","A New Jersey judge overseeing thousands of talc lawsuits consolidated in a federal court is expected to rule soon on a J&J request to disqualify expert witnesses hired by plaintiffs, including the head of an asbestos testing lab who testified in earlier trials that he found the contaminant in the company’s powders.","In a filing Friday, plaintiffs’ lawyers drew the judge’s attention to the FDA finding of asbestos in the bottle of Baby Powder and said they have asked J&J to turn over documents related to the FDA test results and any communications with regulators.","In a brief conference call Friday with analysts and journalists, J&J officials called the FDA test results “extremely unusual,” and suggested the sample may have been contaminated by an outside source or come from a counterfeit bottle.","A few hours later, the FDA shot back with a defense of its laboratory analysis, saying it wasn’t aware of “any records pointing to counterfeit Johnson’s Baby Powder in the U.S. market.”",The FDA declined to provide further comment for this article.

Doctors are allowed to prescribe medicines as they see fit, while companies are only allowed to promote their drugs for approved uses.","A jury in 2015 awarded Murray $1.75 million after finding J&J was negligent in failing to warn of the risk of gynecomastia. A state appeals court upheld the verdict in February 2018 but reduced it to $680,000.","Plaintiffs in the mass tort litigation had been barred from seeking punitive damages since 2014, when a state court judge ruled that the law of New Jersey, which prohibits punitive damages and is J&J’s home state, should be applied globally to the cases.","But a Pennsylvania Superior Court ruling in 2018 cleared the way for punitive damages awards, holding that the law of each plaintiff’s state should instead apply."

The litigation, as I’ve told you before, has been counterintuitive from its beginning in March. Scott’s trust is a shareholder of Johnson & Johnson, yet the trust is suing to force J&J to allow it to propose a mandatory arbitration provision to cut off all shareholders’ rights to sue for securities law violations.","J&J, meanwhile, contends that mandatory shareholder arbitration is illegal under state and federal law so it has assumed the weird posture of defending shareholders’ right to file securities class actions. Noting that anomaly, two big state pension funds, the California Public Employees’ Retirement System and the Colorado Public Employees’ Retirement Association, moved last month to intervene in the litigation to assure that U.S. District Judge Michael Shipp of Trenton isn’t depending on J&J alone to represent shareholders’ interests.",Want more On the Case? Listen to the On the Case podcast.,"On Friday, Johnson & Johnson and the pension funds filed separate motions to dismiss the suit by Scott’s client, the Doris Behr 2012 Irrevocable Trust. The two briefs assert overlapping but not identical arguments for why Judge Shipp should end the case now. Judge Shipp has not yet ruled on the funds’ motion to intervene, which may still be opposed by the trust. But the dismissal briefs show, if nothing else, that the pension funds, which own a combined 10 millions shares of J&J, deserve to be heard in a critical test of their right to sue for securities violations.",Harvard professor Scott said in an email that he is not commenting on the litigation.,"The crux of arguments by both J&J and the pension funds is that corporate bylaws govern only a corporation’s internal affairs and cannot be used to restrict shareholders’ external rights under federal securities laws. Both briefs reminded Judge Shipp that the Attorney General of New Jersey, where J&J is headquartered, already made that very point to the Securities and Exchange Commission last January, when the SEC was weighing J&J’s request for permission to exclude the Behr trust’s mandatory arbitration proposal from the proxy materials sent to J&J shareholders.","The New Jersey AG, as the briefs explained, sent the SEC a letter opining that the proposal would be illegal under New Jersey’s corporate law because corporate bylaws cover only internal corporate affairs. The state AG, Gurbir Grewal, cited, among other precedent, a December 2018 opinion from Vice-Chancellor Travis Laster of Delaware Chancery court in Sciabacucchi v. Salzberg, which examined the distinction between internal corporate affairs governed by bylaws and external affairs outside of their case in a case challenging the legality of forum selection clauses. The SEC considered the New Jersey AG’s opinion sufficiently weighty to make it the basis of the commission’s decision in February to bless J&J’s exclusion of the trust’s mandatory arbitration proposal.","The company and the pension fund argued in Friday’s filing that there’s no doubt AG Grewal correctly interpreted the scope of corporate bylaws, citing case law and commentary dating all the back to Sir William Blackstone. “Bylaws are expressly limited to those matters that relate to a … corporation’s internal affairs, or those affairs relating to the rights and duties of the corporation, its officers and directors and its shareholders,” wrote J&J’s lawyers at Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom. Moreover, both briefs pointed out, when New Jersey’s legislature recently amended state corporate law to allow corporations to amend their bylaws to select a forum for certain internal affairs suits by shareholders, lawmakers left federal securities litigation off of the list.","The trust, represented by Walter Zimolong of the Zimolong firm, has argued that under U.S. Supreme Court precedent on the Federal Arbitration Act, most recently in 2018’s Epic Systems v. Lewis, the FAA preempts state laws barring arbitration. Both the J&J and pension fund briefs refuted that assertion. I’m summarizing nuanced and multifaceted arguments, but, in essence, the briefs contend that the FAA preempts only state laws that disfavor arbitration provisions. Because New Jersey corporate law applies generally and doesn’t even mention arbitration, state law does not disfavor arbitration and therefore, according to J&J and the pension funds, is not preempted by the FAA.",The company and the pension funds also argued that corporate bylaws are not a contract between a company and its shareholders – but the contention received considerably more weight in the funds’ brief than in the company’s. I mentioned above that the dismissal briefs underscore the importance of giving the pension funds a say in litigation that could have deep repercussions for shareholders’ rights. The funds’ analysis of whether bylaws should be considered an enforceable contract shows why.,"The funds’ lawyers from Gupta Wessler, Pomerantz and Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossman acknowledged that courts have construed bylaws to imply shareholder assent to their terms, notably in 2013’s Boilermakers v. Chevron, in which Delaware Chancery Court okayed forum selection clauses for shareholder litigation against corporate board members. Such decisions have been based on the premise that when shareholders buy stock, they’re on notice that the company’s board has unilateral power to change the bylaws, and that those bylaws are binding.","But that precedent, according to the pension funds, has looked at the compact between shareholders and corporations as a matter of corporate law – not contract law. As the Supreme Court has interpreted the FAA, arbitration provisions are governed by contract, which means, according to the pension funds, that both companies and shareholders must agree to mandatory arbitration. Under that reasoning, the funds said, shareholder arbitration cannot be imposed by a unilateral corporate bylaw. Shareholder might not even know if a corporation decides to amend its bylaws to impose arbitration of securities claims. “This falls well short of the consent required to manifest agreement to an arbitration agreement,” the pension funds said.","In the J&J case, of course, the Behr trust isn’t asking for J&J unilaterally to change its bylaws to impose arbitration but for the company to allow shareholders to vote on the trusts’ proposal to mandate arbitration. In fact, as I’ve explained, J&J explicitly opposes changing its bylaws, arguing that it would be illegal for the company to require shareholders to arbitrate.","But the pension funds have an interest beyond the J&J case in establishing principles that will shut down shareholder arbitration proposals by companies that, unlike J&J, want to preclude securities class actions.

It was to eventually employ at least 1,500 people and help bring development to a rural area near Hyderabad in southern India.","Yet, three years after the U.S. healthcare company completed construction of production facilities for cosmetics and baby products on the 47-acre site, they stand idle.","Two sources familiar with J&J’s operations in India and one state government official told Reuters production at the plant, at Penjerla in Telangana state, never began because of a slowing in the growth in demand for the products.","One of them said that demand didn’t rise as expected because of two shock policy moves by Prime Minister Narendra Modi: a late 2016 ban on then circulating high-value currency notes, and the nationwide introduction of a goods and services tax (GST) in 2017.","J&J spokespeople in its Mumbai operations in India and at its global headquarters in New Brunswick, New Jersey, declined to respond to a list of questions from Reuters.",Modi’s office did not respond to a call and an email with questions.,"Aimed at rooting out corruption and streamlining the tax system, the double whammy of ‘demonetization’ and GST – were two of Modi’s signature policy moves. But instead of encouraging economic activity as intended, they did the opposite, at least in 2016-2018, by sapping consumer demand, according to some economists.","Many businesses, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, complained publicly – some in their financial statements - that they suffered a drop off in orders. The suspended J&J project stands as one of the most vivid examples of the impact on the broader investment picture.","In the first month after demonetization, some business surveys showed that sales of products such as shampoos and soap fell more than 20 percent.","Lack of jobs growth and a farm-income crisis because of low crop prices have hurt Modi in the current general election, according to several political strategists.","Still, Modi and his ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party are expected by many of the strategists to be in a position to get a second term – probably with support of some other parties - when votes are counted on Thursday, partly because of his strong stance on national security issues.","A range of Modi’s business policies, such as capping prices of medical devices, forcing tech companies to store more data locally and stricter e-commerce regulations have in the past two years hurt plans of American multinationals such as J&J, Mastercard, Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart.","The groundbreaking of the J&J facility in Penjerla, its third in the country, was carried out with much fanfare in 2014, attended by Telangana state’s Chief Minister Chandrashekar Rao, who hailed the foreign investment as a big win for local communities.

After the groundbreaking in 2014, Pradeep Chandra, who was Telangana’s special chief secretary of industries, told Business Today magazine that “based on the extent of land (J&J) have acquired we believe that they are looking at much larger expansion here.”","Local media reports at the time said the J&J facility would employ some 1,500 people.","A J&J official, who was not identified by name, was reported subsequently in December 2016 in India’s Business Standard assaying that the $85 million plant would be operational by 2018 after it had overcome procedural delays.

Talc supplier Luzenac America Inc started including that information on its shipments to J&J and other customers.","J&J, meanwhile, looked for ways to sell more Baby Powder to two key groups of longtime users: African-American and overweight women. The “right place” to focus, according to a 2006 internal J&J marketing presentation, was “under developed geographical areas with hot weather, and higher AA population,” the “AA” referring to African-Americans.","“Powder is still considered a relevant product among AA consumers,” the presentation said. “This could be an opportunity.”","In the following years, J&J turned those proposals into action, internal company documents show. It distributed Baby Powder samples through churches and beauty salons in African-American and Hispanic neighborhoods, ran digital and print promotions with weight-loss and wellness company Weight Watchers and launched a $300,000 radio advertising campaign in a half-dozen markets aiming to reach “curvy Southern women 18-49 skewing African American.”","These are only some of the more recent examples of J&J’s decades-long efforts to offset declining Baby Powder sales amid rising concern about the health effects of talc, based on a Reuters review of years of J&J print, radio and digital advertising campaigns and thousands of pages of internal marketing documents and email correspondence.","Adults have been the main users of Johnson’s Baby Powder since at least the 1970s, after pediatricians started warning of the danger to infants of inhaling talc. As adults became ever more crucial to the brand – accounting for 91 percent of Baby Powder use by the mid-2000s – J&J honed its powder pitches to court a variety of targeted markets, from teen-focused ads touting the product’s “fresh and natural” qualities, to promotions aimed at older minority and overweight women.","Today, women who fall into those categories make up a large number of the 13,000 plaintiffs alleging that J&J’s Baby Powder and Shower to Shower, a powder brand the company sold off in 2012, caused their ovarian cancer or mesothelioma.","Many of the ovarian cancer lawsuits have blamed the disease on perineal use of J&J cosmetic talcs – a claim supported by some studies showing an association between such use and increased cancer risk. The most recent cases have alleged that J&J’s talc products contained asbestos, long a known carcinogen.","In an investigation published Dec. 14 here, Reuters revealed that J&J knew for decades that small amounts of asbestos had occasionally been found in its raw talc and in Baby Powder and Shower to Shower, based on test results from the early 1970s to the early 2000s – information it did not disclose to regulators or the public.","J&J challenged the findings of the Reuters report, describing them as inaccurate and misleading.",BABY POWDER “EVERYWHERE”,"Krystal Kim, a 53-year-old African-American, was one of 22 plaintiffs whose case in St. Louis resulted in a jury verdict last summer of $4.69 billion against J&J. Kim said Baby Powder and Shower to Shower were household staples among her family and friends when she was growing up in New Jersey. Kim played baseball as a teenager, she said, and her mother told her to apply Baby Powder to avoid being “the stinky girl.”","“Every time I took a shower, I put Baby Powder on,” recalled Kim, whose ovarian cancer, first diagnosed in 2014, is now in remission. “I put it on my panties, on my clothes, everywhere.”",J&J is appealing the St. Louis verdict. The company did not respond to requests for an interview with Chief Executive Officer Alex Gorsky or any other executive to discuss the company’s marketing of cosmetic powders.,"In an emailed response to questions from Reuters, J&J said its Baby Powder is safe and asbestos-free. It noted that the company’s marketing over the years has been directed at many demographics and groups, and that “we’re proud pioneers of the practice of multicultural marketing.” It also pointed out that some Baby Powder ads have featured the cornstarch version of Baby Powder, the safety of which isn’t questioned.","Reports by Bloomberg News, the New York Times and the Post and Courier of Charleston, South Carolina, have cited some internal J&J documents revealing the company’s focus on African-American and overweight women at certain times. But the full timeline and scale of the marketing efforts, particularly those aimed at teenage girls, in minority communities and through organizations such as Weight Watchers, are reported here for the first time.","Most businesses know the demographic profiles of those who buy their products and, as a matter of course, direct their marketing at those groups. Some – fast-food companies and soft-drink makers, for example – have courted minority customers to increase sales among heavy users at times of growing public concern about the possible health effects of their products.","In a lawsuit filed in Mississippi state court in 2014, Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood alleges that J&J failed to warn consumers of the risks associated with its talc products and accuses the company of implementing a “racially targeted strategy” for selling Baby Powder after J&J became aware of health concerns. The company focused its marketing on “minority communities expected to be more likely to use the talc products,” Hood claims in the lawsuit.","J&J denied the allegations and last year filed a motion for summary judgment in the suit, arguing that the case involved matters of federal law, beyond the state’s purview. A judge in December denied J&J’s motion, a move the company has appealed. The case is scheduled for trial later this year.","In its response to Reuters’ questions, J&J said: “Suggesting that Johnson & Johnson targeted a particular group with a potentially harmful product is incredibly offensive and patently false.”","“DEEP, PERSONAL TRUST”","Sold continuously since 1894, Johnson’s Baby Powder accounted for less than 1 percent of J&J’s $81.6 billion in revenue last year, but it is deemed critical to the company’s family-friendly image. An internal J&J marketing presentation from 1999 refers to the baby products division, with Baby Powder at the core, as J&J’s “#1 Asset,” grounded in “deep, personal trust.”","Beginning in the 1950s, however, a series of case studies published in medical journals pointed to the dangers of breathing in talc. Pediatricians took notice. By the late 1950s, a third of them were recommending cornstarch or oil to treat diaper rash and chafing “because there is no dangerous dust” in them, according to an internal J&J report.","A report in the June 1966 edition of the American Journal of Diseases of Children, citing the deaths of three children who inhaled large amounts of talcum powder, concluded there was “no justification” for using the product on babies because it has “no medicinal value.”","By 1974, more than 60 percent of Johnson’s Baby Powder sales were “attributable to adults” who used it on themselves, according to a J&J analysis.",Losing the connection to the product’s namesake – babies – left J&J eager to cultivate other markets.,"Beginning in the 1970s, J&J ran ads clearly intended to woo young women, in addition to its traditional marketing aimed at families with babies. “You start being sexy when you stop trying,” was the line from an ad that appeared in Seventeen magazine in 1972. The photo shows a young woman stroking a young man’s curly blond hair.","“It’s a feeling you never outgrow,” is how an ad in Family Circle magazine from the mid-1980s put it, with a photo of a bottle of Baby Powder next to a teddy bear alongside the mirrored reflection of a young woman.","In 1989, advertising firm Young & Rubicam submitted a plan to J&J to “initiate a high level of usage” among young women to “augment the weakening baby link.” Under the plan, ads in style magazines like Seventeen, YM, Glamour and Mademoiselle would try to convince teen girls that Johnson’s Baby Powder, “applied daily after showering, is a simple, feminine way to smell clean and fresh during the day.” Young & Rubicam, now known as VMLY&R, declined to comment on the document and referred questions to J&J.","Baby Powder sales continued to fall throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. Since health professionals had already recommended against using talc on infants, a 1986 internal report warned, a “last straw” safety concern could lead consumers to abandon the product altogether.","As early as 1992, the company keyed in on the sales potential with minority women. A J&J memo that year mentions “high usage” rates for Baby Powder of 52 percent among African-Americans and 37.6 percent among Hispanic customers – and notes that women of both ethnicities use the product more than the general population.","The memo suggests investigating “ethnic (African American/Hispanic) opportunities to grow the franchise,” while referring to “negative publicity from the health community on talc,” including “inhalation, dust, negative doctor endorsement, cancer linkage.” Portions of that memo were cited in reports from Bloomberg and the New York Times.","By 2006, the company was recognizing that “consumers do not see a need for powder,” according to a sales presentation that year. Baby Powder shipments had been “stagnating” in recent years, the presentation said, and it was essential to “find a new business model” that “strategically and efficiently targets high propensity consumers.”","Those groups, according to the presentation: African-Americans, nearly 60 percent of whom used Baby Powder by this time, compared to about 30 percent for the overall population; overweight people; and fitness-conscious people looking to lose weight.","It was also in 2006 that the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), an arm of the World Health Organization, classified perineal use of talc as “possibly carcinogenic,” saying available research provided “limited evidence” it caused cancer in humans. That came about 20 years after IARC classified “talc containing asbestiform fibres” as “carcinogenic to humans,” its highest-risk classification.","After the IARC’s 2006 move, talc supplier Luzenac America started including a note about the agency’s latest classification on a chemical safety document accompanying shipments to all customers, including J&J. Under a heading that reads “carcinogenic status,” the document says IARC “has concluded that perineal use of talc-based body powder is possibly carcinogenic to humans.”","In a deposition for one of the ovarian cancer cases tried in St. Louis, a Luzenac America executive, Shripal Sharma, said the company felt it was important to add what he referred to as a warning to the safety document. Asked whether Luzenac knew that J&J did not pass on this warning, Sharma said: “It is not our job to tell our customers what to do with their products.”","In a statement to Reuters, Imerys Talc America Inc, as Luzenac is now known, said: “Talc’s safe use has been confirmed by multiple regulatory and scientific bodies,” echoing J&J’s response.","Through an Imerys spokeswoman, Sharma declined to comment.","Two years after the IARC classification, J&J sought proposals for an “African American agency” to develop marketing campaigns for the company’s baby products line. A 2008 document sent to prospective agencies summed up the situation: “Johnson’s Baby Oil and Baby Powder products, while traditionally used only on babies, are today primarily consumed by adult AA women for use on themselves.” One way to reverse the brand’s decline, it said, was by “speaking to AA consumers with a more relevant message with the most effective media vehicles.”",“ETHNIC CONSUMERS”,"That year, the company contracted with a North Carolina marketing firm, Segmented Marketing Services Inc, which says it specializes in targeted promotions to “ethnic consumers.” The firm would distribute 100,000 gift bags containing Baby Powder and other Johnson’s baby products in African-American and Hispanic neighborhoods in Chicago, according to a contract with J&J.","Run by African-Americans who had been executives at Procter & Gamble Co and Quaker Oats, Segmented Marketing Services has said in past press releases and its own marketing publications that it hands out millions of free product samples and promotional offers through national networks of more than 10,000 African-American and Hispanic churches, and tens of thousands of “beauty salons, barber shops, entertainment venues and healthcare networks.”","The company published an advertorial in 2008 prepared for distribution with Johnson’s baby products in which the firm’s founders, Sandra Miller Jones and Lafayette Jones, said they “welcome” J&J as a partner.","“When caring rituals started in infancy continue through adulthood, a person’s self-confidence and even faith in the world are often strengthened,” the pamphlet said. “Whether in the gym, at work, at church or at the beach, Johnson’s Baby Powder helps grown-ups feel more comfortable in their own skin.” It came with a coupon for $1 off Baby Powder.","Lafayette Jones and Sandra Miller Jones did not respond to calls, emails and LinkedIn messages seeking comment.","J&J also launched campaigns to boost sales of Baby Powder to “curvy Southern women” and athletic adults who want to smell fresh, according to company documents. It advertised in Weight Watchers magazine and offered promotions through the Lane Bryant clothing chain for plus-size women and Curves, a women’s fitness and weight-loss franchise. Marketing plans also included ads to run in Southern Living magazine and during the Style Network show “Ruby,” a reality TV series that documented an obese Georgia woman on a mission to lose weight.","A 2009 presentation laying out the “Powder media plan” highlights that it will reach 31 million people “in the South (hot climates/overweight states),” and that “43% of our plan will focus on the top 10 overweight states in the nation.”",A 2009 ad in Weight Watchers magazine suggests readers “bust stress with a midday workout” and then “stay fresh post-exercise by applying Johnson’s Baby Powder.”,"Internal J&J marketing emails before the Weight Watchers campaign ran discuss whether the women featured are heavy enough to resonate with the intended audience. “Can you ask WW if they have any images of slightly bigger women? They don’t have to be super curvy, but a little bigger than the current image would be preferable,” wrote Grace Lee, a J&J brand manager, to others at the company and ad agency Lowe New York.","Weight Watchers, now known officially as WW International Inc, declined to comment on the campaign. Lee & Interpublic Group of Companies Inc, which owns the former Lowe New York, didn’t respond to requests for comment.","The Weight Watchers campaign was successful, according to a 2009 internal J&J recap, which showed that sales of Baby Powder at Wal-Mart shot up as much as 9 percent during the summer months when the ads ran from the same months a year earlier, reversing a decline.","J&J’s overall Baby Powder media advertising budget increased to a proposed $495,000 for 2010, up 71 percent from $288,000 in 2009, driven by more dedicated spending toward promotions for overweight women.","The company in 2010 launched a radio campaign in the South targeting “Curvy Southern Women 18‐49 Skewing African American.” A presentation from TMPG, a marketing agency that handles promotions with radio DJs, said the campaign made more than 18 million impressions on the target audience through ads and promotions on “urban adult contemporary” radio stations in Southern markets, including Dallas; Atlanta; Nashville; Mobile, Alabama; and Jackson, Mississippi.",The presentation slides feature some photos of plus-size African-American women holding Baby Powder samples at “targeted station events” that also included spa giveaways and “Baby Powder Stay Cool Cash.” TMPG did not respond to requests for comment.,"In a 2010 email, Debra DeStasio, a J&J promotions and marketing manager who oversaw the baby products line at the time, gave the green light to two proposed radio stations for the campaign in Dallas, saying “we are good with those general market stations that have good Hispanic reach and good AA reach.” In another 2010 email, she said the DJs will be the Baby Powder “brand ambassadors,” charged with “communicating our message, encouraging listeners to call in to talk about how they use Baby Powder and driving to retail where appropriate.”","All the radio promotions would be “based on the weather,” she wrote. “If it’s hot and humid, we’ll run that week. If it’s rainy or colder, we won’t.”","DeStasio, who now works as a promotions and marketing manager at Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, did not respond to requests for comment.","J&J’s spending on Baby Powder promotions – coupons, discounts, and samples – came to about $1.2 million in 2008 and again in 2010, almost half of it directed at overweight and minority women. By 2011, the company cut back its promotional spending to $752,000, mostly aimed at the general consumer market.","In 2013, a jury found J&J negligent in the first case ever to claim that regular use of Baby Powder for feminine hygiene caused ovarian cancer. The jury didn’t award monetary damages, but the verdict spawned a cascade of similar lawsuits.","Of the eight ovarian cancer cases that have gone to trial so far, four have resulted in verdicts for plaintiffs and one for the company. Three other verdicts against J&J were overturned on appeal.","In 12 trials of cases claiming that asbestos in talc caused plaintiffs’ mesothelioma, J&J was cleared of liability in five, and plaintiffs won three, resulting in a total of $172 million in damages. Four others resulted in hung juries and mistrials.",J&J is appealing all the verdicts against it.,"Meanwhile, J&J has pulled back from marketing specifically to minority and overweight women. A 2015 presentation makes no mention of minorities, suggesting the brand “target adults, with a focus on men.”","Plaintiffs’ lawyers and other advocates have become more vocal in criticizing the targeted marketing campaigns. In its most recent newsletter, the National Council of Negro Women, a women’s leadership group with about 30,000 members, drew attention to the issue with an essay penned by civil-rights lawyer Ben Crump, who is representing some Baby Powder plaintiffs.","In an interview, Janice Mathis, the council’s executive director, said: “Lots of products target African-Americans. That’s marketing 101: Go where our customers are. What has me disturbed about this is that you didn’t give any caveat to the customers, once you knew there was a possibility there was some danger.”"

The preliminary injunction motion, filed in federal court in Trenton, New Jersey, will be, to the best of my knowledge, the first courtroom test of the legality of mandatory shareholder arbitration.",Want more On the Case? Listen to the On the Case podcast.,"The injunction motion, which follows a March 1 lawsuit against the company, was filed by the Doris Behr 2012 Irrevocable Trust. The trust, which is advised by Harvard law professor emeritus (and arbitration proponent) Hal Scott, wants the court to compel J&J to allow shareholders to vote on a proposed bylaw precluding securities class actions and directing investors to resolve claims in individual proceedings before the American Arbitration Association. (Yes, that’s right: The trust, a shareholder, wants a bylaw that would end shareholder class actions.)","J&J, as I’ll explain, opposes the bylaw. Its lawyers at Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom didn’t respond to my request for comment on the trust’s preliminary injunction motion but said in a letter Wednesday to the judge overseeing the case that there’s no need for urgency and that the trust’s arguments are contrary to the weight of authority.","Scott and the trust first proposed a shareholder vote on mandatory arbitration last November. That proposal, as you may recall, led to a blowup at the Securities and Exchange Commission. Johnson & Johnson’s Skadden lawyers informed the SEC in December that the company considered the proposal a violation of federal securities law. J&J, they said, intended to exclude the Behr trust’s proposal from proxy materials and from a shareholder vote. The company asked the SEC’s corporate finance division for reassurance that the commission would not bring an enforcement action against the company for blocking the proposed resolution.","In the past, the SEC has pushed back hard against shareholder arbitration, including 2012 proposals by shareholders at Gannett and Pfizer that presaged the Behr trust’s J&J proposal. But some SEC commissioners have lately announced support for mandatory shareholder arbitration provisions and SEC chairman Jay Clayton has been notably non-committal on the issue. Arbitration opponents saw the trust’s J&J proposal as a threat - and mobilized opposition.","The SEC ended up agreeing that J&J could block the proposal, relying mostly on a last-minute opinion from New Jersey’s attorney general that said mandatory arbitration was illegal under state law. Notably, however, the SEC seemed to back away from its previous position that requiring shareholders to arbitrate would violate federal law – possibly in recognition of pro-arbitration rulings by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2013’s American Express v. Italian Colors and 2018’s Epic Systems v. Lewis.","That shift by the SEC, Scott told me Wednesday, was critical to the trust’s decision to go to court to demand J&J put its arbitration proposal to a shareholder vote. By basing its decision on the New Jersey AG’s view of New Jersey law, Scott said, the SEC left open the question of whether the AG’s interpretation is correct – and failed entirely to address the trust’s arguments that the Federal Arbitration Act preempts state law no matter what New Jersey has to say about mandatory shareholder arbitration.","The trust, which is represented in the new litigation against Johnson & Johnson by Jonathan Mitchell of Mitchell Law, lays out its case comprehensively in Tuesday’s preliminary injunction brief, which seeks a declaration that J&J violated federal securities laws by excluding the trust’s proposal and an injunction requiring J&J to announce in a supplemental proxy statement that mandatory shareholder arbitration is legal under state and federal law. J&J has already sent out proxy materials for the scheduled April 25 meeting, omitting mention of the Behr trust’s proposal.","According to the trust’s injunction brief, J&J bears the burden of proving its proposal is illegal and the company has been unable to identify any federal statute or New Jersey law or legal precedent that precludes mandatory shareholder arbitration. The trust argues that after the Supreme Court’s decisions in Epic and Italian Colors, such provisions are permissible under federal law because nothing in the Securities and Exchange Act implies a partial repeal of the Federal Arbitration Act. (I’m condensing a nuanced, multi-pronged argument but that’s the gist.) The trust contends that the New Jersey AG erroneously based his conclusion about the state-law legality of mandatory arbitration on a recent Delaware ruling on forum selection in corporate charters – and even if the AG were correct in his interpretation, the FAA trumps state law.","“There is no need for this court to explore the contours of New Jersey law or engage in … guesses about what the New Jersey courts might do,” the brief said. “If the law of New Jersey purports to prohibit a corporation and its shareholders from agreeing to arbitrate their disputes, then that law is preempted by the FAA.”","In a letter filed Wednesday with U.S. District Judge Michael Shipp of Trenton, J&J counsel Andrew Muscato of Skadden said the trust has manufactured urgency after waiting weeks to file a complaint and injunction motion. “Conspicuously absent from the application is any attempt to demonstrate emergency circumstances,” the letter said. “Plaintiff did not file suit until March 21 — more than four and a half months after it knew Johnson & Johnson intended to exclude the proposal, almost six weeks after the SEC issued its no-action letter and eight days after the company filed (and mailed and/or made available electronically) its proxy materials.”","J&J also previewed the merits of its argument against mandatory shareholder arbitration. “(The trust’s) theory is built upon the notion that everyone else got it wrong,” the company’s letter said. “In actuality, (the trust) has no likelihood of success, as evidenced by the numerous authorities it dismisses as wrong, including the State of New Jersey’s chief legal officer.”","Muscato didn’t respond to my email request for comment. Plaintiffs’ advocacy groups will probably also want a say in this case. After the trust sued, the American Association of Justice and the Secure Our Savings coalition, which is led by Public Justice and the Consumer Federation of America, issued statements warning that the mandatory arbitration provisions the Behr trust is advocating will make it easier for corporations to defraud investors. “We will continue to oppose this effort and any others that aim to shield unscrupulous corporations from accountability by hiding behind forced arbitration clauses,” the AAJ statement said.","Trust lawyer Scott told me he just wants to give J&J shareholders a chance to vote on mandatory arbitration. “I believe it’s they who should make the decision,” he said. “I want to give them a choice.”"

To prevent abuse, patients must take the drug in a doctor’s office or medical facility and cannot take it home.","Currently available anti-depressants such as Eli Lilly and Co’s Prozac work on neurotransmitters like serotonin and norepinephrine, but most drugs take at least four weeks to show effect and fail to produce an adequate response in about 30 percent to 40 percent of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD).","“Spravato has the potential to change the treatment paradigm and offer new hope to the estimated one-third of people with major depressive disorder who have not responded to existing therapies,” said Mathai Mammen, global head of J&J’s Janssen Research & Development.","Spravato has been touted as an asset with blockbuster potential and is expected to improve investor sentiment toward the growth prospects of J&J’s pharma unit Janssen, as its top-selling rheumatoid arthritis drug Remicade faces increased competition from cheaper biosimilars.","The treatment carries a boxed warning - FDA’s harshest - flagging the risk for sedation and difficulty with attention, judgment and thinking, abuse and misuse, and suicidal thoughts after administration of the drug.","Spravato is absorbed by the lining of the nasal passages and into the blood stream and will be used along with a newly prescribed oral antidepressant, Johnson & Johnson said in a statement here.","During clinical trials, Spravato was found to relieve depression symptoms within 24 hours in some patients, said Janssen spokesman Greg Panico.","The approval comes after an FDA advisory panel in February voted heavily in favor of the drug esketamine, saying its benefits outweighed the risks.","However, the panel members echoed concerns raised by FDA staffers regarding the increased risk of sedation, dissociation and higher blood pressure observed in the study.",The drug is also being tested in patients with depression who are at a high risk of committing suicide.,"Recent research shows that depression involves deterioration of the quality and number of nerve cell connections in areas of the brain related to mood.

The company revealed in its annual report on Wednesday that it had received subpoenas from the U.S. Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission related to talc litigation.","Some plaintiffs’ lawyers, however, played down the impact of the ruling.","It was a trial in St. Louis’s 22nd Circuit Court, brought by 21 plaintiffs from outside of the city whose cases were joined to that of a single St. Louis resident, that in July produced a record $4.69 billion talc verdict against J&J. The company is facing several more such lawsuits in St. Louis.","However, Missouri’s high court on Feb. 13 ruled in a separate talc case that allowed a non-resident to participate in joined cases was “a clear and direct violation” of state law barring the use of joinder - combining two or more cases - to allow courts to hear cases they otherwise could not.",Most state courts can only hear cases involving plaintiffs or defendants from that state or alleging injuries occurring within their jurisdiction. The U.S. Supreme Court strengthened those restrictions in a 2017 decision.,"But the St. Louis court had allowed out-of-state residents to continue to sue New Jersey-based J&J through liberal use of joinder. In the case that produced the July verdict, 18 of the plaintiffs were from outside Missouri and three were from outside the city of St. Louis. Of the roughly 700 talc cases filed in St. Louis, only 40 involve Missouri residents, according to court filings.","If the Feb. 13 ruling closes off the St. Louis court to non-resident claims, J&J may have a stronger hand defending itself in smaller talc cases spread out among other, potentially less plaintiff-friendly state and federal courts.","“There’s no real way of reading this decision other than this court clearly saying you can’t join claims if the injury did not occur in the venue,” said Mark Cheffo, a New York-based product liability defense lawyer not involved in talc litigation.","J&J in a statement said it was pleased with the decision. “One claim that is properly before a court cannot provide a basis for drawing into a trial other claims that are not. We believe that decision is clearly correct, and we continue to believe that the science doesn’t support plaintiffs’ claims,” the company said, declining further comment.",Some plaintiffs’ lawyers said the Feb. 13 ruling was not as definitive as Cheffo suggests.,"“If defendants are celebrating this ruling as the end of St. Louis mass tort, they have not read the entire Missouri case law,” said Eric Holland, a St. Louis-based plaintiff lawyer involved in the talc litigation.","Holland pointed to a 2016 Missouri Supreme Court decision that upheld a $38 million verdict in a pharmaceutical product liability case the defendant claimed had been improperly joined. The court let the result stand, saying that even an improper joinder did not render the trial unfair to defendants.","Though the 2016 ruling involved a case already decided, Holland and other plaintiffs’ lawyers said they planned to argue its fairness analysis also applies to out-of-state talc claims in cases yet to go to trial. They said they would also argue joining the cases was the most efficient use of judicial resources.",Defense lawyers said the Feb. 13 decision would likely mean dismissal or severing of the out-of-state claims from four upcoming multi-plaintiff cases scheduled for trial in St. Louis. Two of the cases were halted by the Missouri Supreme Court ahead of its ruling.,Holland and other plaintiff lawyers said they would challenge J&J requests to sever or dismiss talc cases by arguing the Feb. 13 decision did not overrule the 2016 ruling.,Cheffo said the 2016 ruling could make it harder for J&J to overturn the July verdict and its record penalty because the company would have to prove the joinder led to an unfair trial.,‘FORUM SHOPPING’ BY OUT-OF-STATE PLAINTIFFS,"The St. Louis court has been a venue for more talc trials and has seen larger verdicts than any other jurisdiction. Outside of St. Louis, the only other significant talc verdicts against J&J to date have come in lawsuits filed by individual plaintiffs in New Jersey and California, where the company is currently facing jury verdicts totaling $142 million.","A Los Angeles jury delivered a $417 million talc verdict against J&J in 2017, but the judge threw out the award weeks later as unsupported by the evidence. All talc verdicts against J&J are on appeal.",The St. Louis court has a history of issuing large punitive damages against companies and has often been criticized by business groups as allowing “forum-shopping” by out-of-state plaintiffs.,"While J&J faces some trials brought by individuals in other jurisdictions, the multi-plaintiff St. Louis cases are the largest and have the most potential to produce additional billion-dollar verdicts.","Plaintiffs allege that the talc in Johnson’s baby powder and other J&J products causes ovarian cancer, or that asbestos contamination in the talc causes ovarian cancer and mesothelioma. Asbestos is a known carcinogen linked to mesothelioma.","J&J and its talc supplier, Imerys Talc America, a co-defendant in the litigation, deny the allegations, saying numerous studies and tests by regulators worldwide have shown their talc to be safe and asbestos-free.",Reuters on Dec. 14 published a report detailing that J&J knew that the talc in its raw and finished powders sometimes tested positive for small amounts of asbestos from the 1970s into the early 2000s - test results it did not disclose to regulators or consumers. (reut.rs/2Gh88KO),"J&J is currently facing roughly 13,000 lawsuits over talc, most of which have been consolidated in federal court in New Jersey. Many plaintiff’s lawyers have fought to keep cases out of federal court, which they feel favors corporate defendants.","Three juries have rejected claims that Baby Powder was tainted with asbestos or caused plaintiffs’ mesothelioma. Five other juries have failed to reach verdicts, resulting in mistrials.","In a statement, Imerys Talc America said the Missouri ruling affirmed legal arguments it has made in litigation for the last four years. The company filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on Feb. 13, saying it lacked the financial clout to defend against talc lawsuits."

798,https://www.reuters.com/article/legal-us-otc-arbitration/shareholder-arbitration-advocates-see-silver-lining-in-sec-rebuff-in-jj-case-idUSKCN1Q22PR,2019-02-13T20:41:57Z,Shareholder arbitration advocates see silver lining in SEC rebuff in J&J case,"(Reuters) - On Monday, Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton announced that the SEC will not countenance the latest attempt to curtail securities class action litigation via mandatory shareholder arbitration. But for shareholder arbitration advocates, the news wasn’t all bad: The SEC seems to have backed away from its longstanding position that shareholder arbitration runs afoul of federal securities laws, leaving open an avenue for future investor arbitration proposals.","Technically, Clayton simply announced his support for a recommendation from the SEC’s Division of Corporate Finance that the SEC decline to bring an enforcement action against Johnson & Johnson if the company refuses to allow shareholders to vote on a mandatory arbitration proposal by a J&J investor. Harvard emeritus law professor Hal Scott, who serves as trustee of the Doris Behr 2012 Irrevocable Trust, notified J&J in November of the trust’s proposal that the company allow shareholders to vote at their annual meeting in April to amend J&J’s bylaws to require investors to arbitrate any disputes with the company as individuals. (Yes, it may seem counterintuitive that a shareholder wants to force a corporation to allow fellow shareholders to vote to give up their right to sue, but such is the nature of shareholder proposals.)",Want more On the Case? Listen to the On the Case podcast.,"Johnson & Johnson, represented by Skadden Arps Slate Meagher & Flom, sent a letter to the SEC in December, asking for the SEC’s blessing to exclude the trust’s proposal from shareholder proxy materials. J&J’s argument in that December letter was that mandatory shareholder arbitration violates the anti-waiver provisions of federal securities laws, which preclude delegation of enforcement to arbitrators. Skadden pointed out that in 2012, when the SEC was reviewing mandatory arbitration proposals pushed by Michigan law professor Adam Pritchard on behalf of","shareholders at Pfizer and Gannett, SEC staff agreed that such proposals could “cause the company to violate the federal securities laws.” In those cases, the SEC allowed Pfizer and Gannett to exclude the shareholder proposals from a vote based on the potential federal securities law conflict, so, according to Skadden, it should do the same for J&J.","Scott replied that since 2012, the U.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly endorsed arbitration as an alternative forum for the vindication of rights conferred by federal law, most recently in 2018’s Epic Systems v. Lewis. The Epic decision, Scott argued, stands for the proposition that oversight by federal agencies, whether the SEC in the case of mandatory shareholder arbitration or the National Labor Relations Board in the Epic case, is no bar to resolving disputes by arbitration.","In January, the back-and-forth between Scott and J&J in letters to the SEC shifted from federal securities law to state corporate law. (The letters are included in Monday’s public filing by the SEC’s Division of Corporate Finance.) Last December, as you may recall, Vice-Chancellor Travis Laster of Delaware Chancery Court ruled, in a case considered a harbinger of a prospective test of the legality of mandatory arbitration, that Delaware corporate law does not allow companies to select the forum for the resolution of external claims by shareholders, including claims under federal securities law. After Laster’s decision in Sciabacucchi v. Salzberg, Johnson & Johnson, which is incorporated in New Jersey, obtained an opinion from counsel at Lowenstein Sandler that New Jersey law would also preclude mandatory shareholder arbitration.","The attorney general of New Jersey, Gurbir Grewal, subsequently sent the SEC a Jan. 29 letter advising that the J&J shareholder proposal would violate state law. The New Jersey AG cited Delaware’s Sciabacucchi ruling, explaining that New Jersey courts often look to Delaware for guidance. “The proposal’s provisions on mandatory arbitration of federal securities law claims are not ones which New Jersey law permits to be set forth in the bylaws of a business corporation,” the AG letter said. “These provisions would not address the internal concerns of Johnson & Johnson, but rather would seek to regulate external relationships of the company that are governed by federal law. Accordingly, the proposed bylaw amendment would violate New Jersey corporate law.”","The New Jersey AG’s opinion carried the day for the SEC’s corporate finance staff. The SEC’s no-action letter to Johnson & Johnson said it regarded the AG’s letter as “a legally authoritative statement that we are not in a position to question,” and that, in light of the AG’s position, the SEC would not recommend an enforcement action if J&J excluded the mandatory arbitration proposal from a shareholder vote.","The SEC said it was not expressing a view on whether the New Jersey AG was right or wrong, suggesting that if J&J or Hal Scott wanted a definitive determination on the legality of mandatory shareholder arbitration under New Jersey law, they should go to court.","The SEC letter ducked the federal-law question that had dominated early arguments by both Scott and J&J. “We are also not expressing a view as to whether the proposal, if implemented, would cause the company to violate federal law,” the letter said. “Chairman Clayton has stated that questions regarding the federal legality or regulatory implications of mandatory arbitration provisions relating to claims arising under the federal securities laws should be addressed by the Commission in a measured and deliberative manner.”","Clayton’s announcement emphasized that the Corporate Finance division’s no-action recommendation was based on the New Jersey AG’s interpretation of state law – and also warned, once again, that no one should expect quick answers from the SEC on the legality of mandatory shareholder arbitration under federal securities laws. “Since 2012, when this issue was last presented to staff in the Division of Corporation Finance in the context of a shareholder proposal, federal case law regarding mandatory arbitration has continued to evolve,” the SEC chair wrote. “Further, I am not aware of any circumstances where the Commission has weighed in on the legality of mandatory shareholder arbitration in the context of federal securities law. In light of the unsettled and complex nature of this issue, as well as its importance, I agree with the approach taken by the staff to not address the legality of mandatory shareholder arbitration in the context of federal securities laws in this matter, and would expect our staff to take a similar approach if the issue were to arise again.”",So why do Hal Scott and Adam Pritchard say the SEC’s handling of the J&J case represents some progress for shareholder arbitration proponents?,"Because the SEC did not contend mandatory shareholder arbitration is illegal as a matter of federal law, which was the basis of the 2012 no-action letters to Pfizer and Gannett. “The SEC has reversed its position,” Scott told me in an interview Wednesday. “The most significant thing about this letter is that the SEC didn’t say the proposal would be illegal under federal law.”",Added Pritchard: “They’ve backed away from an obviously frivolous position.”,"Scott said he plans to appeal the SEC staff’s recommendation to the commissioners. He said he doesn’t expect to win, but believes that the SEC’s framing of its recommendation as a matter of state law leaves room for him to argue that the commission must confront the federal law issue because federal securities laws preempt state law. In the past, Scott said, the SEC has said it would not issue no-action letters based on ambiguous state law – a rule, he said, that should certainly apply in these circumstances.","At the very least, Scott said, the SEC’s no-action letter leaves open the prospect of mandatory shareholder arbitration for corporations based in states whose corporate codes would permit it. (I should point out that Vice-Chancellor Laster’s Sciabacucchi ruling is on appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court so we can’t be sure even what Delaware’s final word will be on corporations picking a forum for federal securities claims.) I asked Scott whether he’s working on more shareholder proposals calling for mandatory arbitration, perhaps in a state with an AG who won’t put up a fight. He declined to say.","The SEC declined to provide a statement responding to comments from Scott and Pritchard, and J&J counsel Marc Gerber of Skadden declined to comment through a firm spokeswoman.","But I did talk to Paul Bland of Public Justice, whose group has been a stalwart opponent of shareholder arbitration, about whether we should read the SEC’s handling of the J&J case as a sign that the commission will no longer rely on its previous view of mandatory arbitration and federal securities law.","“I don’t see anything in the staff letter or the chairman’s statement that says the Federal Arbitration Act overrides federal securities law,” Bland told me. He said it makes sense that the SEC didn’t address that question because it didn’t need to. The New Jersey AG’s letter made the case an easy call for the SEC, Bland said: “The SEC dodged a thorny legal issue and went with an answer that was much more straightforward.”","I asked Bland whether he’s frustrated that the SEC has assiduously avoided reaching a conclusion, as the debate over mandatory shareholder arbitration has intensified, about whether the FAA trumps federal securities laws. Arbitration proponent Pritchard told me, for instance, that he thinks SEC Chair Clayton is putting off a reckoning on that question because he doesn’t want to face Congressional criticism. (In fairness, Clayton has said repeatedly that when the issue is ripe, the entire commission will reach a decision on shareholder arbitration as a matter of federal law, rather than leaving the matter in the hands of Corporate Finance staffers; his implication in the J&J case was that the New Jersey AG’s opinion obviated the need for a final decision as a matter of federal securities law.)","Bland told me he can’t criticize Clayton at all. “I feel like the chairman did investors a huge service,” he said. “This is a huge victory for shareholders.”"

In 1972, a University of Minnesota scientist found what he called “incontrovertible asbestos” in a sample of Shower to Shower. Other tests by J&J’s own contract labs and others periodically found small amounts of asbestos in talc from mines that supplied the mineral for Baby Powder and other cosmetic products into the early 2000s.",The company did not report to the FDA three tests by three different labs from 1972 to 1975 that found asbestos in the company’s talc.,"The Reuters story drew no conclusions about whether talc itself causes ovarian cancer. Asbestos, however, is a carcinogen. The World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer has listed asbestos-contaminated talc as a carcinogen since 1987. Reuters also found that J&J tested only a fraction of the talc powder it sold. The company never adopted a method for increasing the sensitivity of its tests that was recommended to the company by consultants in 1973 and in a published report in a peer-review scientific journal in 1991.","The ad J&J ran in newspapers Monday also pointed to an online talc fact page the company created with “independent studies from leading universities, research from medical journals and third-party opinions.”","That website has changed since early December, according to a Reuters review of online archives.","The website, for instance, no longer contains a section headlined “Conclusions from Global Authorities” that as recently as Dec. 5 listed organizations including the U.S. FDA, the European Union and Health Canada as among entities that have “reviewed and analyzed all available data and concluded that the evidence is insufficient to link talc use to cancer.”","On Dec. 14, the day Reuters published its report, that section of the website had been removed. It is not clear exactly when the online page changed.",The Canadian government released a draft report this month that found a “consistent and statistically significant positive association” between talc exposure and ovarian cancer. The draft report also said that talc meets criteria to be deemed toxic.,"The draft report put forth proposed conclusions that are subject to a public comment period and confirmation in a so-called final screening assessment, Health Canada said.","If the conclusions are confirmed, Canadian officials will consider adding talc to a government list of toxic substances and implementing measures to prohibit or restrict use of talc in some cosmetics, non-prescription drugs and natural health products, Health Canada said.","A J&J spokeswoman said the company removed the website section after the Canadian government issued the draft report. “We chose to be conservative while that draft is under review,” the spokeswoman said.","While J&J has dominated the talc powder market for more than 100 years, the products contributed less than 0.5 percent of J&J’s $76.5 billion in revenue last year."

That drop was on top of the 10 percent plunge that wiped out about $40 billion of the company's market capitalization following the Reuters report here Friday. J&J also announced Monday that it would be repurchasing up to $5 billion of its common stock.","Senator Edward Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat on the Environment and Public Works Committee, on Friday sent a letter to the head of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration calling on the agency to investigate the findings in the Reuters report to determine whether J&J misled regulators and whether its Baby Powder products threaten public health and safety.","J&J Chief Executive Alex Gorsky, in his first interview since the Reuters article was published, was scheduled to appear on CNBC’s “Mad Money” with host Jim Cramer on Monday night. J&J knew for decades about the presence of small amounts of asbestos in its products dating back to as early as 1971, a Reuters examination of company memos, internal reports and other confidential documents showed. In response to the report, J&J said on Friday that “any suggestion that Johnson & Johnson knew or hid information about the safety of talc is false.”","A Monday full-page ad from J&J -- headlined “Science. Not sensationalism.” -- ran in newspapers including The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. The ad asserted that J&J has scientific evidence its talc is safe and beneficial to use. “If we had any reasons to believe our talc was unsafe, it would be off our shelves,” the ad said.","J&J rebutted Reuters’ report in a lengthy written critique of the article and a video from Gorsky. In the written critique, posted on the company’s website here, J&J said Reuters omitted information it supplied to the news organization that demonstrated the healthcare conglomerate’s Baby Powder is safe and does not cause cancer; that J&J’s baby powder has repeatedly been tested and found to be asbestos-free; and that the company has cooperated with the U.S. FDA and other regulators around the world to provide information requested over decades.","“Since tests for asbestos in talc were first developed, J&J’s Baby Powder has never contained asbestos,” Gorsky said in the video here. He added that regulators “have always found our talc to be asbestos-free.”",A Reuters spokeswoman on Monday said the agency “stands by its reporting.”,"Reuters’ investigation found that while most tests in past decades found no asbestos in J&J talc and talc products, tests on Baby Powder conducted by scientists at Mount Sinai Medical Center in 1971 and Rutgers University in 1991, as well as by labs for plaintiffs in cancer lawsuits, found small amounts of asbestos. In 1972, a University of Minnesota scientist found what he called “incontrovertible asbestos” in a sample of Shower to Shower. Other tests by J&J’s own contract labs and others periodically found small amounts of asbestos in talc from mines that supplied the mineral for Baby Powder and other cosmetic products into the early 2000s.",The company did not report to the FDA three tests by three different labs from 1972 to 1975 that found asbestos in the company’s talc.,"The Reuters story drew no conclusions about whether talc itself causes ovarian cancer. Asbestos, however, is a carcinogen. The World Health Organization’s International Agency for Research on Cancer has listed asbestos-contaminated talc as a carcinogen since 1987. Reuters also found that J&J tested only a fraction of the talc powder it sold. The company never adopted a method for increasing the sensitivity of its tests that was recommended to the company by consultants in 1973 and in a published report in a peer-review scientific journal in 1991.","The ad J&J ran in newspapers Monday also pointed to an online talc fact page the company created with “independent studies from leading universities, research from medical journals and third-party opinions.”","That website has changed since early December, according to a Reuters review of online archives.","The website, for instance, no longer contains a section headlined “Conclusions from Global Authorities” that as recently as Dec. 5 listed organizations including the U.S. FDA, the European Union and Health Canada as among entities that have “reviewed and analyzed all available data and concluded that the evidence is insufficient to link talc use to cancer.”","On Dec. 14, the day Reuters published its report, that section of the website had been removed. It is not clear exactly when the online page changed.",The Canadian government released a draft report this month that found a “consistent and statistically significant positive association” between talc exposure and ovarian cancer. The draft report also said that talc meets criteria to be deemed toxic.,"A J&J spokeswoman said the company removed the website section after the Canadian government issued the draft report. “We chose to be conservative while that draft is under review,” the spokeswoman said.","While J&J has dominated the talc powder market for more than 100 years, the products contributed less than 0.5 percent of J&J’s $76.5 billion in revenue last year."

Investors erased $40 billion of its market value on Friday, after Reuters revealed the U.S. healthcare giant knew for decades its baby powder was sometimes tainted by asbestos. The company says the story is an “absurd conspiracy theory” as “every method available to test J&J’s talc for asbestos has been used by J&J, regulators, or independent experts, and all of these methods have all found that our cosmetic talc is asbestos-free.” If history is a guide the market may have over-reacted, but lawsuits and brand damage don’t easily dissipate.","J&J faces thousands of lawsuits from users that claim the company’s talc resulted in health problems. In July, a jury in Missouri ordered the company to pay $4.7 billion to 22 women who claimed their ovarian cancer was caused by asbestos in J&J’s products. The market had shrugged off that decision. The company’s stock by Thursday had risen nearly 5 percent since January, giving it a market capitalization of almost $400 billion.","Lopping off 10 percent of that may be an overreaction. Investors tend to panic when multibillion-dollar settlements become likely. Drugmaker Merck lost $27 billion, or 27 percent of its market value, when it pulled painkiller Vioxx in 2004 after studies linked it to heart attacks and strokes. The company ended up settling most cases for under $5 billion. Likewise, investors have discounted a $15 billion liability at Bayer for lawsuits that claim a weedkiller made by Monsanto, the U.S. company it acquired this year, caused cancer, according to Bank of America Merrill Lynch. The bank believes the payout will probably be somewhere below $5 billion.","The legal bills won’t abate anytime soon. Merck was still dealing with Vioxx-related litigation more than a decade after the drug was pulled from the market. But the hit to J&J’s reputation may be the most difficult to fix. In the 1980s, seven people died after taking Tylenol painkillers that had been laced with cyanide. The company’s response to that tragedy – recalling 31 million bottles, taking out advertisements warning customers, and introducing tamper-proof packaging – became a staple business-school lesson in reputation-buffing. If the company really sat on troubling data relating to a product used on babies around the world, it might end up being taught as a counter-example."

An early 1970s study of 1,992 Italian talc miners shows how it worked: J&J commissioned and paid for the study, told the researchers the results it wanted, and hired a ghostwriter to redraft the article that presented the findings in a journal.","The effort entailed other attempts to influence research, including a U.S. government study of the health of talc workers in Vermont. J&J’s Windsor Minerals Inc subsidiary, one of several mine operators involved in the study, developed a relationship with the U.S. National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health researchers to “even influence the conclusions” through suggestions of “subjective interpretations,” according to a 1973 Windsor Minerals memo.","Peter Bicks, outside counsel for J&J, told Reuters in an email that for the Vermont study, company “representatives acted in an ‘educational and advisory capacity’ to provide the researchers with a realistic study plan.”","A 1979 article in the Journal of Environmental Pathology and Toxicology detailing the findings of the study was not good news for talc. It reported a “significant increase” in “respiratory cancer mortality” among miners. A subsequent analysis of the underlying data published in 1988 determined that at least one of the workers died of mesothelioma, the cancer most closely associated with asbestos.","The proposal to study the health of miners of the Italian talc used in Baby Powder for decades came from William Ashton, J&J’s longtime talc supply chief. Ashton had obtained a summary of miners’ medical records compiled by an Italian physician, who also happened to control the country’s talc exports.","J&J should use those records “for maximum benefit,” Ashton said in a May 8, 1973, letter to Dr Gavin Hildick-Smith, J&J’s director of medical affairs. “It seems to me that the Italian records give us the opportunity to fortify a position on talc safety.”","At the time, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration was considering a limit on asbestos in talcs. In an Oct. 18, 1973, memo, Hildick-Smith advised J&J: “The risk/benefit ratio of conducting an epidemiological study in these mines must be considered.”","By early 1974, the study was a go. Hildick-Smith sent money to the Italian talc exporter-physician to hire a team of researchers. Hildick-Smith told the lead researcher in a June 26, 1974, letter exactly what J&J wanted: data that “would show that the incidence of cancer in these subjects is no different from that of the Italian population or the rural control group.”","That is exactly what J&J got, Hildick-Smith told colleagues a few months later. At a meeting on Sept. 27, 1974, for a “Talc/powder Safety Studies Review,” he reported the Italian study would dispel the “cancer concern associated with exposure to talc.”","The following spring, Hildick-Smith got a draft of the Italian study from the lead researcher. It needed work to meet the “form and style” requirements of the target journal, he told colleagues in a March 31, 1975, memo. He added that he would send it to a scientific ghostwriter “who will hold it in confidence and rewrite it.”","The article that appeared in 1976 in the Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine reported results even better than J&J had bargained for. The study found fewer lung cancer deaths than expected, a result that the authors said supported “the thesis of no cancerogenic effect attributable to pure talc.”","It also found no mesothelioma, the signature cancer of asbestos exposure. There is no evidence J&J manipulated or misused the data. Experts for plaintiffs have testified that the Italian study was too small to draw any conclusions about the incidence of such a rare cancer. J&J’s expert witnesses have concluded the opposite.","Bicks noted that the Italian study has been updated three times – in 1979, 2003 and 2017 – “confirming the lack of association between exposure to asbestos-free talc, lung cancer and mesothelioma.”","J&J got a lot of mileage out of the study. It was cited in a review article titled “The Biology of Talc,” published Nov. 1, 1976, in the British Journal of Industrial Medicine. In addition to dozens of published studies, the review cited unpublished research, including one experiment that used a doll as a proxy for infants and that supported the company’s position on the safety of talc. It didn’t disclose that J&J had commissioned the unpublished research.",The author of the review article concluded that the “concern that has been expressed about the possible health hazard from consumer exposure to cosmetic talc is unwarranted … There is no evidence that its normal use poses a hazard to health.”,"The author was Hildick-Smith, the J&J physician executive who had overseen the Italian study and played a key role in the company’s talc safety research. The article did not disclose his J&J connection, identifying him only as a Rutgers University clinical assistant professor. Hildick-Smith died in 2006."

The jury reached its decision in less than a day, following five weeks of expert testimony from both sides.","The stakes are potentially high for J&J, which is facing 9,000 cases nationwide over talc. The company has had previous success in overturning large verdicts in talc cases as well as others alleging harm from its products.","But several legal experts said Missouri courts, including at the appellate and supreme court level, were historically plaintiff-friendly and could prove unreceptive to J&J’s arguments.","“J&J has strong arguments, but unless they get to certify this case to the U.S. Supreme Court, which are very long odds, this decision is likely to stand,” said Lars Noah, a law professor at the University of Florida.",He said he expected J&J would go through the appeals process but would ultimately wind up settling the case.,Beisner said he was not aware of any interest in settlement. “Our attention will remain focused on the appeals from this and the other trials awaiting review.”,"Beisner said jurisdiction will be one major basis for J&J to appeal Thursday’s verdict. Most of the 22 plaintiffs were not Missouri residents, and he said they should not have been allowed to sue New Jersey-based Johnson & Johnson in St. Louis under a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision that severely restricted state courts’ jurisdiction over injury lawsuits brought by non-residents against out-of-state companies.",J&J seized on that decision to successfully overturn previous talc verdicts in Missouri.,"Mark Lanier, the plaintiffs’ lawyer who won Thursday’s verdict, said he was ready for that argument.",Lanier said his team amassed “hundreds of pages of evidence” showing lobbying efforts and baby powder focus groups J&J conducted in the state. He also spotlighted the claim by 15 of his non-resident clients that they used a specific short-lived J&J talc-based product manufactured by Missouri-based contractor.,"“I hope they focus their appeal on jurisdiction because I’m confident we’ll win that,” Lanier said. He did say that he expects the punitive damages award to be halved during the appeals process due to a Missouri state law that caps such damages, but is confident the verdict would stand overall.",The $4.69 billion in total damages includes $550 million in compensatory damages and $4.14 billion in punitive damages.,"Elizabeth Burch, a law professor at the University of Georgia, said that even under the new Supreme Court guidance, the women’s claim that they used the specific product, if true, provided “a pretty strong link to Missouri.”","At trial J&J had unsuccessfully sought to cast doubt on the 15 women’s claims to have used the same product that was only available for a few months, depicting it as a ruse designed to bypass the jurisdiction issue. Beisner said J&J would make the same argument on appeal.","Along with jurisdictional arguments, Beisner said the company would continue to put forth its case that scientific studies overwhelmingly show talc itself is safe and the company’s talc-based products never contained asbestos.","“None of plaintiffs’ experts were able to put forward a valid theory and there is simply no science to support what they call asbestos in the product,” said Beisner.","J&J says decades of testing by laboratories and independent agencies, including a study by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, support its position. The company said plaintiffs’ tests showing asbestos contamination were “junk science.”",But Lanier argued that it was the agencies and labs cited by J&J that used flawed testing methods that failed to detect asbestos.,"Noah said Missouri judges have historically applied a lower standard than federal court for admitting scientific evidence. Last year the state passed a law requiring its courts to adopt the federal standard, but he said state courts would be interpreting that requirement for years to come.","“Missouri judges aren’t going to suddenly change their tune,” Noah said."

The company said it remained confident that its products do not contain asbestos or cause cancer.","“Every verdict against Johnson & Johnson in this court that has gone through the appeals process has been reversed and the multiple errors present in this trial were worse than those in the prior trials which have been reversed,” J&J added, saying that it would pursue all available appellate remedies.","J&J has successfully overturned talc verdicts in the past, with appeals courts pointing to a 2017 decision by the U.S. Supreme Court that limits where personal injury lawsuits can be filed.","Of the 22 women in the St. Louis trial, 17 were from outside Missouri, a state generally regarded as friendly towards plaintiffs.

The $117 million verdict by a New Jersey jury last week, however, involved a different form of cancer that is clearly linked to asbestos.",Plaintiffs lawyers claim that internal J&J documents seen in that trial show that baby powder had been contaminated with asbestos. They now plan to use the documents in upcoming ovarian cancer trials to allege that the asbestos contamination also caused that form of cancer.,"J&J and Imerys Talc America, a unit of Imerys SA, have vowed to appeal the New Jersey verdict and deny asbestos has ever been present in their products or that their talc can cause any form of cancer.","The case of Stephen Lanzo, a New Jersey resident who claimed he developed mesothelioma after using baby powder since his birth in 1972, was the first time a jury saw the internal J&J documents which plaintiffs claim show that J&J knew since the 1970s that the talc in its baby powder was contaminated by asbestos during the mining process.","J&J says the documents present no such evidence, but merely show the company’s caution.","Peter Bicks, a lawyer leading J&J’s talc asbestos defense, said that in the early 1970s, the company was looking at how it could potentially remove asbestos from talc if the two became intermingled in the mining process. He says no contamination was ever found, citing decades of testing by independent laboratories and scientists.",Bicks called the claims of a link between talc and asbestos “junk science.”,"Mesothelioma, a rare and deadly form of cancer closely associated with exposure to asbestos, affects the delicate tissue that lines body cavities.","While the link between asbestos and mesothelioma is sufficiently established, scientists are divided on whether asbestos exposure can cause ovarian cancer. Some studies have shown an association between the two, while other studies have found no such link.","Elizabeth Burch, holder of the Charles H. Kirbo Chair of Law at the University of Georgia, said it remained an open question whether talc contained asbestos and that each case would turn on the facts.","But J&J, which had $76.5 billion in sales in 2017, gives the plaintiffs’ bar an enticing new target, said Nathan Schachtman, a lecturer at Columbia University who used to defend asbestos cases.","Some 3,000 people are diagnosed with mesothelioma each year, according to the American Cancer Society, a number that Howard Erichson, a law professor at Fordham University who specializes in mass tort litigation, called significant from a legal standpoint.","But the roughly 22,000 women who were diagnosed with ovarian cancer last year, according to the National Cancer Institute, provide lawyers with a potentially much larger pool of plaintiffs to tap.","“This is just the tip of the iceberg,” said Mark Lanier, one of the lawyers representing consumers, who said plaintiffs would file thousands of additional mesothelioma and ovarian cancer cases.",New Jersey-based J&J in a statement after the Lanzo verdict said plaintiffs’ attorneys had shifted their strategy to focus on asbestos after a series of losses at trial and in court rulings over previous allegations that the talc itself causes cancer.,"Of the six ovarian cancer trials to date, juries found J&J liable five times, but a Missouri appellate court threw out the first verdict and a California judge tossed another. Appeals of the other cases are pending.",J&J in November also won the first trial over allegations that its talc contained asbestos and caused a woman’s mesothelioma. Plaintiffs lawyers say the jury in that case did not see the documents presented during the Lanzo trial.,But Erichson said the widespread use of J&J’s consumer products generally make the company an attractive litigation target.,"“Baby powder is as ubiquitous a product you can think of and there are lots of people who can testify they’ve been exposed to it,” he said."
