This is being discussed, the source said.",Turkey’s banking watchdog says the percentage of NPLs could rise to 6 percent this year and some economists see it going even higher.,"Last month, Standard and Poor’s said it expected the NPL ratio of Turkish banks to top out at around eight percent in 2019, and added that a broader definition of problem loans would reach 15-20 percent.","“Companies such as Japan’s Orix and the U.S.’s Bain Capital have been holding intense talks with financial consultants since September to enter the Turkish market,” another source said.
