The seamless flow of traffic is what really keeps Britain supplied.”","Dover handles 120 billion pounds ($158 billion) worth of goods a year from food to drugs, timber and electronics - around 17% of the world’s fifth’s biggest economy’s commerce in goods.","It spent much of last year testing contingency plans in case Britain left the EU, the world’s biggest trading bloc, without a trade deal. Now it wants the government to set out as soon as possible the outline of a new trade deal to prepare for change.","“We can plan around any scenario, be it summer or winter. The key thing is being able to plan on it with enough lead time,” Bannister said in the control tower, surrounded by banks of CCTV screens.","“Now that we are into a transition period, it will become really important to get the parameters of that trade arrangement known to the industry as quickly as possible so that businesses have the longest opportunity to prepare.”",For many small and medium-sized companies that could mark a significant departure as they start filling out declaration forms for the first time.,“TOTAL CLARITY” NEEDED,"The government has given little detail about how any new free trade deal will work, but Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s spokesman has said companies need to prepare for the “extra processes” required once Britain has left the customs union.","Rod McKenzie, head of policy at the Road Haulage Association, said the time for rhetoric was over.","“Logistics operators need total clarity on what needs to be done and by whom: any fudges will be exposed by events and the peril of queues at Dover or delays elsewhere along the supply chain is a nightmare for business,” he said.","Dover had warned that a two-minute delay in the system could lead to a 17-mile (27-km) queue of lorries, leading to a rupture of intricate supply chains that have built up across Britain and Europe in the 47 years of British EU membership.","Bannister said these close ties had delivered benefits to consumers across the continent, and that this would need to be maintained."

Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said Britain will leave without a deal if the EU refuses him one at a summit on Thursday and Friday, though parliament has passed a law ordering him in that case to seek an extension.","A “no-deal” divorce could disrupt trade between the world’s fifth largest economy and the world’s biggest trading bloc, dislocating supply chains, cutting food imports and turning southern England and northern France into giant lorry parks as congestion brings traffic in Dover and Calais to a standstill.","France has been testing ways to deal with any disruption, including customs declarations done far from the port to reduce congestion.","French customs officials have said a computerized “smart border” and 500 extra customs agents will be ready on Day 1 of Brexit, but have said they are not allowed to coordinate planning directly with their British counterparts while Brexit negotiations are ongoing.",So when will the trouble hit - if it does?,"Bannister, who has warned that a 2-minute delay at Dover could lead to a 17-mile queue of lorries in Kent, said he expected lower traffic volumes in the first days after Brexit, especially with France celebrating All Saints’ Day on Nov. 1.","“If it begins to bite in that second week we will begin to feel it fast,” he said. “I expect that on Nov. 1 it will be okay and that is primarily due to it being a low traffic day.”","While Dover’s famous White Cliffs are just 33 km (21 miles) from France, the port has held immense symbolic, strategic and military significance for centuries as the key to the kingdom.","The Norman Castle which sits atop the cliffs may lie upon a much older Iron Age fort, while in the Cold War, the tunnels deep beneath the castle were designated as a regional power center should London be destroyed by a Soviet nuclear attack.",Bannister said one of the problems is that no-one actually knows on what terms the United Kingdom will be trading after Brexit.,"“If there is a deal, it depends what the nature of the deal is. One of the challenges that we have is that we don’t yet know what the rules of the game are going to be,” he said. “Right now all we can plan on is a no-deal Brexit scenario.”","British government no-deal planning documents from August, known as Operation Yellowhammer, said 50-85% of lorries might not be ready for French customs, reducing the flow rate to 40-60% of current levels within one day.","“That is a pessimistic outlook,” Bannister. “What I am anticipating is that there will be more border-ready vehicles by the time they get to the border.”","On motorways across the United Kingdom, signs warn: “Freight to EU - papers may change 1 Nov. Please check.”",Other uncertainties are what happens on the British road system - whether it clogs up - and what happens on the EU border in Calais.,Bannister said the size of trade with the EU meant that any delays would hurt both sides.,"“Government here in the UK has been very clear and very firm that there will be no incremental checks at the border so traffic will continue to flow - we have not had the same level of assurance from the French authorities,” he said.",($1 = 0.7977 pounds)
