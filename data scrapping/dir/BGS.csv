B&G said in February that freight costs ate into its 2017 income of $217.5 million.","Food companies began to signal possible price hikes this year in response to soaring trucking and rail costs. Industry leaders Nestle NESN.S, Procter & Gamble Co PG.N and Unilever Plc ULVR.L have refrained from doing so as the sector reels from changing consumer tastes and pressure from retail customers to keep prices low.","“It’s a pretty justifiable increase,” B&G Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer Kenneth Romanzi said in an interview on the sidelines of the conference. “Many customers demanded paperwork to see. It was pretty simple to show. We hadn’t taken (an increase)” in a few years.","The hikes should cover the new freight costs, which are likely to remain high, Romanzi said. Changes in trade promotions have been underway for months and the company does not anticipate any further price increases this year, he added.","Costs for making canned goods have also risen due to new tariffs from the Trump Administration on steel and aluminum. Those have largely been tempered by relatively benign inflation in other key commodities costs, he said.",(This version of the story corrects net income in paragraph 4 from $574 million to $217.5 million.)
