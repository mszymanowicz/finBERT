The rate for TAVR was 8.5 percent versus 15.1 percent for surgery, data unveiled at the American College of Cardiology scientific meeting in New Orleans showed.","At 30 days, the Sapien also resulted in a lower rate of stroke - 0.6 percent versus 2.4 percent - which had been the primary safety concern when these systems were first introduced.","Medtronic’s rival Evolut TAVR system met the main goal of its so-called non-inferiority trial in more than 1,400 low-risk patients, proving as safe and effective as surgery, data presented at the same meeting showed.","The combined rate of all-cause death or disabling stroke after two years was 5.3 percent for Evolut versus 6.7 percent for surgery, a difference considered not statistically significant.","At the 30-day mark, Evolut was significantly better on safety. With TAVR, the composite rate of death or disabling stroke was 0.8 percent versus 2.6 percent for surgery. TAVR was also better on other safety measures after 30 days.","TAVR systems can cost about five times as much as traditional replacement heart valves, providing a significant source of revenue for the companies. But they can be more cost effective overall due to much shorter hospital stays and recovery times.","Jefferies analyst Raj Denhoy said he expects the TAVR market to grow in both size and competition, with Boston Scientific’s Lotus system poised for potential U.S. approval this year.","TAVR “is pretty dramatic technology and it should be used in a lot more patients than it’s being used in already,” Denhoy said.","(This story corrects the day of the scheduled presentation, typo on number of patients in paragraph 9)"
