They were discovered by KPMG as the audit firm scrutinized ABB’s books for 2018.","The spokesman declined to describe the weaknesses in detail, calling them “certain IT failures” in some North American and group applications. He also did not say how long the weaknesses existed.","“These control failures did not lead to any financial misstatement and there was no need to restate numbers,” ABB said in a statement.","“However, the controls failures could have led to a potential misstatement of the company’s financial statements and are therefore called out as a material weakness.”","Among remedial plans for the 2018 weaknesses, ABB said it is boosting its risk-identification processes, training and trying to clearly communicate control responsibilities.","“We cannot be certain that the measures we have taken, and expect to take, will be sufficient to address the deficiencies identified or ensure that our internal control over financial reporting is effective,” ABB said in a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing.","The failures have had financial consequences for ABB executive committee members, the Zurich-based company said.","Short-term incentives “reflected, for some executives, the material weakness in controls”, ABB said, without specifying which top managers were affected.","According to ABB’s annual report, Chief Executive Ulrich Spiesshofer’s short-term compensation fell to 2.1 million Swiss francs ($2.1 million) in 2018 from 2.4 million francs a year earlier. His total pay package slipped about 8 percent to 8.5 million francs.","Chief Financial Officer Timo Ihamuotila, who earned 3.5 million francs in 2018, saw his short-term compensation rise, while Americas boss Greg Scheu also saw an increase.",Three division leaders including Power Grids head Claudio Facchin saw their bonuses fall.,"On average, ABB’s executive committee (EC) members including Spiesshofer hit 85 percent of performance objectives, the 2018 annual report showed, well off the 95.4 percent average in 2017.","This is the latest instance of financial controls problems at ABB in recent years.

Future acquisitions would depend on ABB having the management capacity to integrate the target company.","“You should not expect acquisitions in the tens of billions,” Spiesshofer said, adding smaller technology purchases could still be possible in areas like measurement technology.","“At the moment the plan is very clear, we are going to return the money - we have a strong cash flow and a clear direction going forward.”"

If a sale creates no value for ABB there will be no deal,” the source added.","Spiesshofer in October 2016 rejected calls from Cevian Capital, ABB’s second-largest shareholder, to separate Power Grids, which sells equipment like substations and transformers to utilities.","Cevian had argued that the unit lacked synergies with the rest of ABB’s business, and that the company’s conglomerate structure made it too complex to run efficiently.","Since then Power Grids has only slightly improved its performance. Its relatively low profitability compared to other divisions has weighed on ABB’s share price, which recently fell to its lowest level since December 2016.","The company’s share price remains far short of the 35 Swiss francs which Spiesshofer said could be possible if the company retained Power Grids, and the level which Cevian said could be achieved by ABB and a separate listing of Power Grids together.","“It’s been almost two years since the unfavourable decision (to keep Power Grids) and the share price has developed miserably,” Christer Gardell, managing director of Cevian, told Swedish daily Dagens Industri in August.","“ABB must stop with explanations and whitewashes, now they simply have to deliver shareholder value.”","Spiesshofer, who has led ABB since September 2013, hinted this year at a possible separation when he said ABB’s current organisation was not “cast in stone”.","Power Grids employs 36,000 people and had sales of $10.4 billion last year. It had an operating profit margin of 9.7 percent during the second quarter, a decline of 40 basis points from a year earlier and outside its target range of 10 to 14 percent.","If a deal is approved, ABB could concentrate on more profitable areas like electrification and automation. The company could also be interested in buying General Electric’s power conversion unit, the first source said.","Infrastructure funds, which normally invest in public assets like toll roads and airports, are interested in acquiring a stake in Power Grids, while industrial companies including possible bidders from Asia could also enter the bidding, a second source said.","ABB had been in discussions with China’s State Grid on the unit in the past, but no deal ever materialised, another source said.
