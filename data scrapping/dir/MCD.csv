And chains like Shake Shack Inc are known for having some of the fast-food industry’s crispiest french fries.,"With delivery and to-go orders soaring during the pandemic, marketing “crisp” is risky if the food arrives at consumers’ homes limp and listless. In a quest to keep the crunch as long as possible, many chains are tweaking their recipes, trying different additives, formulations, cooking techniques and temperatures.","Delivery orders at U.S. restaurants were 154% higher in January 2021 than they were a year earlier, according to data analytics firm The NPD Group/CREST.","Delivery comprised 12% of all restaurant orders in January 2021, versus just 5% a year prior.

Those whose sales fell less than 25% in the last two weeks of March - about a third of owners - had to pay.,"The remaining 65% of franchisees lost more than 25% of sales in the last half of the month, so their April 10 payments were deferred for four months - totaling $180 million, the company said.","Tovar said in “several” cases, individual owners were on the cusp of the 25% sales loss for the end of March, but McDonald’s agreed to defer those payments anyway to help the franchisee.","March, April and May base rent payments have been deferred for four months for all operators.","The company also reduced national advertising fees by 0.5%,. It is halting store renovations and some new openings, which will save $1 billion in 2020 capital expenditures, it said in regulatory filings. The cuts will save franchisees some money.","“We reserve the right to make additional changes down the road,” Tovar said. (Reporting by Hilary Russ Editing by Leslie Adler)"

The markets cover 85 percent of the company’s global beef supply chain.","Under the McDonald’s policy, medically important antibiotics cannot be used to routinely prevent disease in food animals in the supply chain.","The company does not expect the policy to raise hamburger prices, although franchisees set their own menu prices, spokeswoman Lauren Altmin said.",Franchisees operate about 90 percent of McDonald’s restaurants.,"The Animal Health Institute, which represents pharmaceutical companies, said it supported “judicious” use of antibiotics and that drug makers are developing alternatives.",Merck did not respond to a request for comment.,"Elanco said a small portion of its portfolio includes medically important feed-grade antibiotics. The drugs are used to treat conditions such as liver abscesses and respiratory diseases, for which there are not effective alternatives, spokeswoman Colleen Parr Dekker said","“It is important to ensure that policies do not move faster than science,” she said.","Bob Smith, an Oklahoma-based cattle veterinarian for Veterinary Research and Consulting Services, said farmers have worked to cut back on antibiotic use while keeping cattle healthy. The lack of alternatives limits their options, however, when animals fall ill, he said.","“We will need those medically important antibiotics in meat production for a long, long time,” Smith said. “We want to use those wisely.”","The U.S. Food and Drug Administration last year said sales and distribution of medically important antibiotics for food production fell 14 percent from 2015 to 2016, the first decline in year-to-year sales since the agency began collecting the data in 2009. Chicken accounted for 6 percent of the sales, while swine and cattle came in at 37 percent and 43 percent, respectively.","Many restaurants and meat companies have moved away from using antibiotics in chicken production in recent years, in part because McDonald’s did so. The Chicago-based chain has an outsize influence on farm practices due to its size.","Removing antibiotics from cattle is more difficult, experts said, because the animals live longer than chickens and have more chances to fall ill.",Hamburger chain Wendy’s Co a year ago said it would buy about 15 percent of its beef beginning in 2018 from producers that have pledged to reduce by 20 percent their use of an antibiotic.,"“What McDonald’s is doing will hopefully start to shift the industry all together from over-using antibiotics,” said Matt Wellington, antibiotics program director for advocacy group U.S. PIRG."
