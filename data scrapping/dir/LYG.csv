Well-coiffed Chief Executive António Horta-Osório will leave the 23 billion pound UK bank in 2021, nine months after incoming Chairman Robin Budenberg joins. The smooth transition will reassure shareholders, and give Budenberg time to find a successor to boost fee income and test the waters on M&A.","Horta-Osório’s tenure, which will have lasted for a decade by the time he departs, has been a triumph in relative, if not absolute, terms. Lloyds investors earned a return including reinvested dividends of minus 38% since March 2011. That’s abysmal, but still superior to Barclays’ minus 51% and Royal Bank of Scotland’s minus 69%. Brexit, low interest rates, compensation for mis-selling and the pandemic hurt everyone. But Horta-Osório controlled what he could: Lloyds’ costs were 49% of revenue last year, compared with the 59% average for the UK industry, according to UBS analysts.","The bank’s orderly transition improves its chances of maintaining that lead. Horta-Osório is due to leave in the middle of next year. Incoming Chairman Budenberg, whose appointment was unveiled on Monday, will join the board in October and take over from Norman Blackwell at the start of 2021. That gives the former investment banker, who helped orchestrate the government’s 2008 bailout of UK banks including Lloyds, at least nine months to find a successor. Potential candidates include Chief Financial Officer William Chalmers and Alison Brittain, the CEO of Whitbread who used to run Lloyds’ retail banking arm.","Whoever Budenberg chooses, their skills will have to go beyond Horta-Osório’s knack for cutting costs. The biggest challenge is finding a way to boost revenue while persistent low interest rates squeeze lending margins on core products like mortgages. The obvious solution is to put more resources behind the Scottish Widows insurance division while cranking up fee-based businesses like wealth management. Lloyds’ cost efficiency also puts it in a strong position to absorb smaller lenders like Virgin Money. However, that would require regulators to change their minds about further consolidation in the already concentrated UK banking market.","Finally, the new CEO will have to figure out what retail banking should look like in an increasingly digital economy, while navigating the threat from fintechs and U.S. behemoths like Amazon.com. It’s a tall order. But Lloyds’ board has at least given the bank a good chance of finding the right person."

Lloyds Banking Group is ending its misssold payment protection insurance scandal as it began – with an almighty slap in shareholders’ faces. The UK’s largest domestic-focused bank on Wednesday revised down full-year returns on tangible equity after it posted a 7% decline in first-half pre-tax profits due to a higher than expected PPI charges. Such ‘one-off’ costs should roll off after an August deadline. But it’s still a dent to CEO Antonio Horta-Osorio’s credibility.,"For long-suffering shareholders, the Aug. 29 deadline to claim PPI compensation cannot come soon enough. Back in 2011, the lender took a 3.2 billion pound provision charge in a now-ironic attempt to get out in front of the issue. It has since provisioned more than 20 billion pounds. The first half of 2019 didn’t deviate from this tawdry pattern: Lloyds announced a 550 million pound charge due to higher claimant volumes, roughly 10 times what analysts expected. The fact that shares fell by 4% on Wednesday reflects the fact that Horta-Osorio will still have to pay PPI claims after the deadline, as long as customers get their applications in beforehand.","True, underlying performance is solid enough: the lender posted a respectable 11.5% return on tangible equity. Annual returns will now be around 12%, rather than 14% forecast. And if you take away the PPI provisions and other one-off items then Lloyds’s ROTE rises to a peer-beating 16.3%.","Ordinarily, that should lead to a rally in shares trading at mere tangible book value, assuming a 10% cost of capital. But heady “underlying” returns could yet turn out to be a mirage.","Firstly, Lloyds acknowledged that risks of a ‘no-deal’ Brexit “have increased” – something which would likely lead to a spike in loan losses from historically low levels. Secondly, pressure on lending margins – Lloyds’ net interest margin shrunk by 3 basis points year on year – and the prospect of the Bank of England lowering rates all add up to a new set of headwinds for Horta-Osorio to navigate.","Investors will cheer the end of the miserable PPI saga, and understand the difficulty of forecasting claims. But it shows the dangers inherent in predicting anything other than a worst-case scenario."

So on the consumer side we don’t see any signs of distress,” Horta-Osorio said on Wednesday.","Lloyds has been the only one of Britain’s four biggest lenders not to have taken a provision against a potential Brexit-related increase in bad loans, and its comments contrast with some deteriorating economic indicators.","A survey from the Confederation of British Industry on Wednesday said optimism among smaller British manufacturers tumbled to a three-year low in July, while separate data from Britain’s car sector showed investment fell by more than 70% in the first half of the year.","Lloyds, which has a 15 billion pound ($18 billion) motor finance business, did say weakness in used car prices led to a 27% jump in impairments to 579 million pounds over the six months to the end of June.","The bank said exceptional charges, including the fresh 550 million pound provision for mis-selling payment protection insurance (PPI), would also knock its ability to build capital for 2019.","The PPI provision dragged Lloyds’ pretax profits for the first half of the year down to 2.9 billion pounds, below analysts’ average forecast of 3.45 billion pounds, according to company-provided data.",The lender warned there could be more PPI charges to come.,"“I’d love to be able to tell you that I can guarantee they’ll be no more impact, but I’ve done this for too long and done too many quarters of this.

Investors in the country’s largest retail bank aren’t so sure. Lloyds Banking Group shares look cheap when weighed against CEO Antonio Horta-Osorio’s plan to hit a 15 percent return on equity. That relies on a steep fall in one-off costs and an easy Brexit.,"So far the latter has left Lloyds’ profit blissfully undisturbed. Sure, loan losses increased by nearly one-fifth year-on-year, but from an extremely low base to a manageable 937 million pounds. Rather, it was the fall in so-called ‘one-off’ items which helped drive up profit: pre-tax profit increased by 13 percent year-on-year to 5.9 billion pounds due largely to a decrease in provisions for missold payment protection insurance (PPI). The return on tangible equity rose 2.8 percentage points to 11.7 percent.","Horta-Osorio thinks he can repeat the trick this year, and is promising a 14 percent to 15 percent return. Maybe. PPI provisions should fall further, given an August deadline for compensation. So should nearly 900 million pounds in restructuring charges given the integration of credit card lender MBNA is largely complete. The snag is that supposedly exceptional charges have bedevilled Lloyds for years.","If Lloyds can roughly halve the one-off nasties to 1.4 billion pounds, plus lower operating expenses by another 200 million pounds to around 8 billion pounds, Horta-Osorio can just about hit his 14 percent minimum return target, according to a Breakingviews calculation which assumes flat revenue, a 20 percent rise in bad debts similar to last year, and a 27 percent tax rate. A share buyback would nudge it further towards the 15 percent upper-end target.","The trickier bit is Brexit. A chaotic exit, or even extended period of political uncertainty, would push up loan losses. Analysts are already pencilling in a roughly 37 percent year-on-year jump to 1.3 billion pounds, according to Refinitv. Given that Lloyds has massively grown its share of unsecured lending, where losses heavily correlate with unemployment, that could prove optimistic.","Horta-Osorio can at least plausibly argue that Brexit is out of Lloyds’ control. His stock is trading at 1.1 times book tangible book value, suggesting the market is not panicking, but not giving him full credit for the 15 percent target. Increasing the premium remains contingent on goodwill between London and Brussels. Investors are right to remain nervous."

One is likely to be in Frankfurt and the location of the second is yet to be confirmed, the person said.",The plans by Lloyds - an institution more than 250 years old that has always concentrated its operations in Britain - shows how Brexit is forcing banks to upend history and business models to guarantee they can continue selling their products in Europe.,They are part of a wider trend that is seeing lenders distribute their post-Brexit resources among a number of cities on the continent rather than basing the bulk of operations in one place as they have for decades in London.,"Swiss bank UBS UBSG.S said in March it would pursue a ""decentralized"" model, in line with moves by Goldman Sachs GS.N, Bank of America BAC.N and JPMorgan JPM.N.","Such plans will incur greater costs and complexity, as each subsidiary needs to be capitalized and licensed by regulators.
