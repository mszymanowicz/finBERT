But following the settlement agreement, the court dismissed the action, it added.","MBIA sued Credit Suisse, the second-biggest bank in Switzerland, in 2009 over hundreds of millions of dollars it paid out to compensate investors after thousands of property mortgages failed in the United States.","In November, New York Supreme Court Justice Jennifer Schecter ruled that Credit Suisse breached its representations and warranties to MBIA, which indemnified investors in residential mortgage backed securities issued ahead of the 2008 financial crisis.",The judge found that more than half of the mortgages in the transaction at issue were non-conforming and that MBIA “did not assume the risk of loss that they posed.”,"Credit Suisse had already set aside $300 million in connection to the long dispute with MBIA, but it said in December that it expected the figure to rise to $680 million.","“We are pleased to have resolved this legacy matter,” a Credit Suisse spokeswoman said in a separate emailed statement.","“The settlement amount of $600 million is substantially less than our earlier guidance of up to approximately $680 million and has been fully provisioned for in our 4Q 2020 results, due to be announced on 18th February.” (Reporting by Nandakumar D and Kanishka Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Rashmi Aich)"

The defendants are: UBS Financial Services Inc, UBS Securities LLC, Citigroup Global Markets Inc, Goldman Sachs & Co LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Morgan Stanley & Co LLC; Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc; RBC Capital Markets LLC, and Santander Securities LLC.","MBIA argued that these underwriters failed to do their due diligence on Puerto Rico bonds, which led to disclosures that were “materially false or misleading” and upon which its unit, National Public Finance Guarantee Corporation, relied upon when it decided to insure the debt.",A request for comment from J.P. Morgan was not immediately answered. Representatives of the other banks declined to comment on the lawsuit.,National insured more than $11 billion of Puerto Rico debt. Subsequent defaults led the insurer to make as of July 1 over $720 million in claims payments that the lawsuit seeks to recover in damages from the banks.,The same banks were sued by Puerto Rico’s federally created fiscal oversight board in May for allegedly aiding and abetting the island’s “clearly insolvent” government to issue debt.
