It has steadily moved up the hardware giant’s value chain, from making connector cables for the iPhone and Macbook to manufacturing Airpods.",Last year the company acquired two iPhone assembly plant from Taiwan-based Wistron Corp.,"That move unnerved some executives at Foxconn, the dominant maker of the handsets, and is seen by analysts as a sign of more indigenous Chinese companies making deeper inroads into Apple’s supply chain."
