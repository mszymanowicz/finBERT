8,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-exxon-mobil-trading-insight/exxon-retreated-from-oil-trading-in-pandemic-as-rivals-made-fortunes-idUSKBN2CD19J,"April 27, 2021 9:22 AM UTC",Exxon retreated from oil trading in pandemic as rivals made fortunes,"Exxon Mobil’s effort to build an energy trading business to compete with those of European oil majors unraveled quickly last year as the firm slashed the unit’s funding amid broader spending cuts, 10 people familiar with the matter told Reuters.","The cuts left Exxon traders without the capital they needed to take full advantage of the volatile oil market, these people said. The coronavirus pandemic sent prices to historic lows - with U.S. oil trading below zero at one point - before a strong rebound. That created an immense profit opportunity for trading operations willing to take on the risk.","Exxon instead systematically avoided risk by pulling most of the capital needed for speculative trades, subjecting most trades to high-level management review, and limiting some traders to working only with longtime Exxon customers, according to interviews with 10 former employees and people familiar with Exxon's trading operation. Traders were restricted to mostly routine deals intended as a hedge for Exxon’s more traditional crude and fuel sales rather than gambles seeking to maximize profit, four of the people said.","The trading retreat came after Exxon had worked in the previous three years to bolster its trading unit with revamped facilities, high-level hires and new tools to help traders take on more risk. The company’s cautious strategy in the pandemic sparked the exodus of some of those senior-level new recruits, along with Exxon veterans, as the company downsized the department amid broader spending cuts, according to the people familiar with its trading operation.","""They were careful with capital during a period of time when they maybe shouldn't have,"" one trader who left Exxon in the last year said of its management.","Exxon's trading retreat came as the company overall posted a historic $22.4 billion net loss in 2020. Exxon does not separately report the performance of its trading unit. Reuters was not able to determine the trading department’s overall profit or loss, or the specific reduction it made in capital available for speculative trading.","Some of Exxon’s biggest rivals made enormous trading profits last year as their traders bought oil and stored it when prices plunged, then sold it at higher prices for future delivery. Rival Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) said in March that it doubled its 2020 trading profits to $2.6 billion over the previous year. BP Plc (BP.L)’s trading arm earned about $4 billion, a near record, Reuters reported previously, based on an internal BP presentation. Such profits helped both companies offset massive losses from a collapse in fuel demand and prices as the pandemic curtailed travel worldwide.","Exxon declined to comment on whether it scaled back speculative trading or reduced the department’s capital and staffing. An Exxon spokesman said its trading team continues to have a ""broad footprint.”","""We're pleased with our progress over the past couple of years,"" said spokesman Jeremy Eikenberry.","The cutback in Exxon's trading operation comes amid broader setbacks. The firm's stock, after hitting its lowest level in nearly two decades last year, was removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average, an index of the top 30 U.S. companies. The firm's cash flow declined sharply, and its debt rating was cut two notches in 12 months.",,"Exxon said in October that the firm would eliminate 14,000 jobs, about 15% of its global workforce, by the end of 2021. Among the belt-tightening measures: asking U.S. office workers to empty their own trash bins, two sources said.","HIGH RISKS, REWARDS","Top oil trading firms make money by buying and selling oil to take advantage of price differences in different markets, a strategy known as arbitrage. They also speculate on futures contracts, betting on whether the oil price will rise or fall by specific dates. The big players include trading units at major oil producers such as BP, as well as specialized merchants such as Trafigura AG. (TRAFGF.UL)","The risks are high, but successful trading desks can deliver returns of 20% to 25%, much higher than other parts of the oil-and-gas business, estimated Andy Brogan, a partner at advisory firm EY and leader of its oil-and-gas practice, in an October EY publication.","Exxon, the largest U.S. oil producer, has historically viewed trading skeptically and limited its activity. After Darren Woods became CEO in 2017, however, he broke with tradition and sought to build up the company's small trading unit.","The company began hiring consultants, recruiting veteran traders and revamping its trading floors in Spring, Texas, and Leatherhead, England. Among the hires were well-regarded traders and marketers from firms including commodity trader Glencore Plc (GLEN.L) and U.S. refiners Andeavor and Phillips 66. Exxon equipped the expanded staff with risk management tools to help trading executives assess potential losses, laying the foundation for a bolder strategy, two people familiar with the operation said.","CEO Woods initially pledged last March that the firm would ""lean into"" the oil-market decline by continuing major investments across the company. He reversed course a month later, ordering broad spending cuts as oil fell below $30 a barrel.","Woods vowed to protect a $15-billion-a-year shareholder dividend as Exxon's stock price tumbled. By contrast, Shell and BP reduced their dividends. Exxon’s decision contributed to deep spending cuts and heavy borrowing across the U.S. oil giant, which took on about $21 billion in debt last year. .","The quick retreat of Exxon's revamped trading desk underscores the firm's longstanding aversion to risk, said Anish Kapadia, director of energy at Palissy Advisors.","""The trading business is a risk business,"" he said. ""That has never been one of Exxon's fortes.""",TRADING RETREAT,"Exxon canceled an early 2020 trading strategy meeting at Exxon's Irving, Texas, headquarters. After that, ""everything went on hold,"" said one person close to the company. The oil-market collapse in April triggered a working capital freeze in the trading group, a former Exxon trader told Reuters.","As cost-cutting continued throughout 2020, the trading operations in Texas and England began sending expatriate workers back to their home countries to save on allowances for housing, cars and tuition benefits, said two people familiar with the moves.","Exxon's financial woes and restrictions on trading led to the exodus of many department staffers, including senior traders and managers, according to three former trading employees and others familiar with the operation. Exxon laid off some trading employees and offered others early retirements or severance packages, the people said, while more staffers left through attrition. Reuters could not determine the total number of departures.","Among the prominent departures were Exxon veteran Steve Scott, who led Exxon's British crude oil trading operation in Leatherhead, people familiar with the matter said. They also included Ben Knowles, who was behind Exxon's exports to Europe and Asia; and Nelson Lee, who while at oil producer BHP Billiton orchestrated some of the first exports of U.S. crude in decades before joining Exxon in June 2018.",Scott and Knowles could not be reached for comment.

Production now is about 11 million barrels per day (bpd), down sharply from the record of nearly 13 million bpd hit in late 2019.","The share of drilling activity by Exxon and Chevron in the Permian Basin oil field in Texas and New Mexico dropped to less than 5% this month from 28% last spring, according to data from Rystad Energy.","""We essentially hit a pause button,"" said Chevron Chief Financial Officer Pierre Breber. ""When the world was oversupplied we didn't see the virtue in putting more capital to add barrels."" (Graphic: Exxon and Chevron slash Permian drilling, here)","Neither company is likely to boost spending until next year, according to the companies and analysts. Chevron expects to produce around 1 million barrels daily by 2025 and Exxon 700,000 bpd by 2025, the companies said at investor days this month.","Chevron will increase Permian spending from $2 billion now to pre-Covid levels of $4 billion annually “over the course of the next several years,” Breber said, but the company will not increase drilling in the Permian this year. It is currently running about five rigs in the Permian with two completion crews, down from just under 20 a year ago.","“Although prices are up and underlying fundamentals are strengthening and recovering, we’re not out of the woods yet,” Breber said. “So this year we’re going to stick with our budget.”","Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods recently said the company would use additional profits to reduce debt instead of funding more drilling. Exxon had seven Permian rigs drilling at the start of March and said it expects to keep seven to 10 at work this year, down sharply from 60 at this time last year.","Both companies are likely to increase Permian spending next year, said Stewart Glickman, energy equity analyst at CFRA Research. (Graphic: Permian DUCs slide, )","Five shale companies are driving the recovery through drilling: EOG, Pioneer Natural Resources, Occidental Petroleum, Devon Energy and ConocoPhillips, said Artem Abramov, analyst at Rystad Energy, who also cited activity by smaller, privately owned operators. Producers are also completing backlogs of unfinished wells.","However, output is unlikely to increase dramatically, due to the swift decline rates for shale wells.","“We would need three months of oil prices sustained at current levels followed by six months of drilling activity before production begins to climb higher on a sustained basis,” said Peter McNally at Third Bridge.","Exxon and Chevron are not the only producers keeping spending down. Many shale companies have hedged a majority of expected 2021 oil production at an average price below $45 a barrel, well below current market prices, Enverus' Andy McConn said. The hedges reduce exposure to the recent increase in oil prices, discouraging near-term growth. (Graphic: Permian oil production stalls, )"

But given that its products fuel the world economy, scopes 1 and 2 account for less than 20% of an oil company’s total emissions.","Scope 3, or the impact of its products in use, accounts for the rest. While Exxon recently announced it would begin reporting on its Scope 3 emissions this year, US producers lag far behind European energy majors Royal Dutch Shell, BP, and Total, which last year signed up to in committing to net-zero emissions by 2050 across all three scopes.","Royal Dutch Shell coloured in its net-zero plans for investors in February, announcing that it was cutting back oil production by 1-2% a year and speeding up its timeline to reduce the net carbon intensity of each unit of energy it produces. By 2035 this will be 45% less than 2016, compared to 30% previously, and 100% by mid-century, from 65%.","The oil major will increase investment in renewables, including biofuels and hydrogen, build out its EV charging services network, and boost carbon capture and storage to store an additional 25m tonnes a year by 2035. More controversially, it is also planning a major investment in offsetting, with a target to offset 120m tonnes of its customers emissions by 2030.","Shell’s green energy renewable energy targets aren’t as ambitious as those of BP and Total, which earlier in February announced plans to rebrand itself as TotalEnergies as it transforms into a broad energy company over the next decade.","BP, meanwhile, plans to grow its renewable output 20-fold, while slashing oil output by 40% by 2030, a far more decisive shift than Shell’s 1-2% per year.","Still, in an industry first, shareholders will have an advisory vote on Shell’s transition plan at this year’s general meeting, while the pay of more than 16,500 staff, not just top executives, will be linked to targets to reduce the carbon intensity of its energy products.","It is not just the European energy majors that are far ahead. The Science-based Targets initiative, a partnership between CDP, the United Nations Global Compact, World Resources Institute, and the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), reported in January that 34% of all European companies with the greatest climate impact have committed to, or set, targets in line with science to cut CO2 emissions, in contrast to just 16% in North America and 12% in Asia.",But are even European companies doing enough to bend the curve on dangerous climate change?,"As we reported in the December issue of The Ethical Corporation, until later this year, when the SBTi will publish a new global standard, there has been no standardised mechanism for third-party monitoring and verification, or for companies to report transparently on how they are actually performing against their targets. And even the SBTi does not yet provide rules on reducing scope 3 emissions.","Meanwhile, there has been a proliferation of many more companies setting net-zero targets with no grounding in science, with a major chasm opening between net-zero ambition and concrete action.","According to research by Signal Climate Analytics, about one-third of human-caused greenhouse gas emissions can be tied to the direct and indirect business activities of just 250 companies, which include the world’s biggest oil and gas companies, along with companies in the energy-intensive transport, mining, metals, and manufacturing and consumer goods sectors.","That number excludes privately held and state-owned companies, for which it is much more difficult to obtain high quality, verifiable data. But the direct and indirect emissions of the G250 and their value chains are huge, and they wield enormous power over sector peers, regulatory frameworks and even consumer attitudes about climate change.","In short, where these businesses are going with their treatment of our planet, we are all going.","Over the course of 2021 Reuters and Signal will be delving into the extent to which those 250 companies are taking action to bring their operations in line with 1.5C pathway, focusing on 25 companies per month.","Given the incompleteness of the data, we will list them in their sectors alphabetically, making it easier to draw comparisons between companies within sectors on their climate risk performance, and to answer two key questions: how transparent are they about their total GHG emissions and related environmental impacts, and are they decarbonising fast enough to avoid the worst consequences of an over-heated planet?","The story told by the related chart, looking at the first 25 companies, is not encouraging, given that they alone account for approximately 10% of annual human-caused emissions.","The energy sector dominates, accounting for 17 of the 25, but only three, Royal Dutch Shell, BP and Total, having set a Science Based Target to reduce their emissions. Another nine are doing the bare minimum by admitting that climate change is an important risk, or by disclosing only emission from their own operations.","In other sectors, Thyssenkrupp, Vale, and VW are disclosing plans, although not always including all scopes, to adopt 1.5C aligned science-based targets, showing they are on a path to systematically transform their core products, processes ‒ and in some cases business models ‒ with solutions that reduce or eliminate harmful environmental or climate change impacts.","Among them is U.S.-based diesel-engine manufacturer Cummins, a signatory to the SBTi’s Business Ambition for 1.5C coalition, which has investing meaningfully in a new power segment, combining the company’s electrified powertrains, fuel cells and hydrogen production technology. Over the last three reporting years, GHG emissions across all scopes fell 7% while revenue increased, decoupled from emissions, by 15%. The company also reported record profitability in 2019.","This will be a pivotal year on the climate scene, as big carbon is pushed harder than ever to become better for our global economy and planet. The new Biden administration will bring the United States back to the regulatory discussion, and market signals are likely to continue to increase both the transition opportunity for innovators, and the risk for laggards.","Given this push, many expect the gulf between European companies and in the US on climate risk to narrow, with many more Americans firms among those setting zero-carbon targets in the run-up to the critical COP26 climate conference in Glasgow in November.","As the year progresses, Reuters and Signal Climate Analytics will be updating both the transparency and performance data on our G250 list. Given the urgency of action between now and 2030, we hope to help make a meaningful contribution to revealing where firms are actually turning over a new green leaf, and how the underlying business of carbon intensive industry is transforming.”"

In the fantasy M&A game, Exxon could in theory buy Chevron at a premium, mostly for stock. But Darren Woods may not be investors’ preferred leader for the combined group. Chevron buying Exxon might bring the right chief executive, with Mike Wirth in charge, but a deal that way around could call for too much leverage. There’s a third, way, too: a $400 billion merger of equals.","Exxon is the bigger of the two companies, with a market capitalization of over $210 billion, more than 20% larger than Chevron’s. If it were to offer a 20% premium for its rival, Woods’ Texas-based company could fund the purchase almost entirely with shares and still leave its own shareholders with just over 50% of the combined company, according to a new Breakingviews calculator. And because Chevron has much less debt – and almost as much EBITDA forecast for 2021, according to Refinitiv data – Exxon could close the deal looking less leveraged than it is now.","The trouble is that Chevron’s Wirth has proved a better operator, relatively speaking. Since taking the helm in February 2018, shares are off by just over 25% while Exxon’s stock is down by more than 40%. He has also earned the reputation of being a prudent dealmaker, having walked away from buying Anadarko Petroleum at what was a market high.","Picking the right boss is key to a successful merger. If either company offers a meaningful premium for the other, even cutting 5% of combined operating costs, more than $3 billion a year, wouldn’t compensate, once taxed and capitalized. The chief executive of the new fossil-fuel giant would have to do more with less capital expenditure, too.","But Chevron buying Exxon is a stretch. Wirth would have to issue more than $80 billion of debt so that current shareholders could maintain a majority stake. That would jack up the debt-to-EBITDA ratio at Chexxon to nearly 3 times, more than twice the current level.","A merger of equals is the dream answer, ignoring real-world hurdles like antitrust concerns. The market values of the two companies have been converging. Even now they are close enough, at around 55-45, to argue for an equal union. Then it’s a question of sharing out the chief executive and chairman roles, board seats, headquarter locations, and other sensitive goodies.

He artfully dodged questions about the company’s deals strategy following a Reuters report that said it had conversations with peer Chevron about merging. Woods said the company looks “at a lot of things in that whole space” and that it had been “active in that for quite some time.”,"A deal between the two companies would help to prop them both up in a market with shareholders that are increasingly hostile towards fossil fuels. Woods knows the criticism well – he’s fending off a group of activists. And yet European oil giant BP is facing another type of scrutiny from shareholders, who have yet to reward its pivot to green power. In today’s oil market, chief executives just can’t win.

The rideshare-and-delivery firm is buying the online alcohol dispatch service for $1.1 billion, mostly in stock. Liquor retailers may feel the after-effects for years to come, even if the $105 billion Uber doesn’t.","Uber’s shares, aided by soaring food deliveries during the pandemic, are up 50% in a year. Its enterprise value to forward sales is now a more than 40% premium to ride-sharing competitor Lyft. Drizly, which lets shoppers buy branded drinks from local retailers for rapid delivery, has also experienced a bonanza. In May, for example, sales were five times what it says it would normally expect. It makes sense that Uber would use one inflated valuation to buy another.","Yet the deal could be significant. Uber’s delivery service has already brought restaurants into its sphere of influence. Drizly will add convenience stores too, giving them a new sales channel – but also more intense competition. Drizly is an add-on for Uber, but for thousands of small businesses in its target market, it could be the beginning of an altered state. (By John Foley)","ACT TWO. Former U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has found a new gig. He has formed Ross Acquisition Corp II, a blank-check company that hopes to raise up to $300 million in an initial public offering. It remains to be seen whether his term serving in the turbulent administration of President Donald Trump dents his SPAC goals.","It hasn’t hurt others. Another former Trumper, Gary Cohn, raked in 20% more than expected for his special-purpose acquisition company at $720 million. But he had his Goldman Sachs pedigree behind him, too, and left midway through Trump’s term.","Ross, 83, was a respected billionaire who made his fortune in steel companies and auto parts. But as a government newbie, he was often sidelined in economic battles against China and sometimes fell asleep at meetings. At least a SPAC puts him back on familiar Wall Street ground.

At the high end of its price range of $28 to $30 per share, that values Bumble at around $6 billion.","The company founded by Whitney Wolfe Herd may be learning that modesty is a desirable trait. At $30 a share, and factoring in debt, Bumble is worth around 12 times sales of $543 million for the 12 months ending in September. That’s less than already public rival Match, at roughly 18 times sales, which has seen its market value more than double since Blackstone stumped up $3 billion for Bumble back in November 2019.

That’s great for society but less for pharmaceutical firms. Those earliest out of the gates are doing well. Pfizer said on Tuesday it expects revenue of around $15 billion this year from its shots. It splits this with partner BioNTech, but still expects pre-tax margins nearing 30%. Analysts expect rival Moderna to earn $6 billion, its first year in the black.","In the past week, Johnson & Johnson, Novavax and Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine have all published good results.

Matt Comyn, chief executive of Australia’s largest lender Commonwealth Bank, said on Monday he hopes treating customers properly and helping shield the economy from the worst impact of the pandemic “has gone some way” to doing so.","Two years after a scathing Royal Commission report lambasted the country’s banks, clients are somewhat more satisfied with them than they were in 2019, according to market research firm Roy Morgan. Even so, redemption can take a long time.

Moonpig’s private equity backers are putting a big, fat leaving card in the post. Shares in the e-greetings retailer jumped 24% on its debut on Tuesday. Including debt, that values the group at nearly 19 times 2022 EBITDA, based on its recent growth trajectory.

A wandering eye can cause problems in any union. It seems to be the biggest gripe Elliott Management has with Finnish insurer Sampo, which gobbled up UK peer Hastings Insurance Services amid the pandemic last year. Paul Singer’s fund, which owns a 3% stake in the 20 billion euro insurer, laid out a list of demands on Tuesday including a call to avoid any new deals outside the Nordics. It also wants Sampo to distribute half its 4.3 billion euro stake in Nordea Bank to shareholders.","The Hastings deal has done little for Sampo’s stock market rating. The property and casualty specialist trades on a 14 times forward earnings multiple versus its peer Tryg, valued at 21 times, according to Refinitiv data. Singer’s group says if Sampo follows its advice it can unlock 8 billion euros of value. The insurer’s board may unveil a new strategy on Feb. 24.

Newly formed activist fund Engine No. 1 has taken on the $176 billion oil major, demanding changes. The fund has only about a $40 million stake – or 0.02% to be precise. So Engine needs a few sharks in its corner. Given Exxon’s record of destroying capital and ignoring shareholders, that shouldn’t be hard.","Once the biggest American public company, the Texas-based oil driller is now well down the list. Over the past decade, it has spent $15 billion more on dividends and capital expenditure than cash generated by its business. The result has been a steadily growing debt load and steeply underperforming stock price. The share price has declined about 40% since the start of the year alone, and the company has underperformed rival oil majors over the past five years.",The firm recently begrudgingly acknowledged oil’s difficulties. Next year’s capital spending will fall to between $16 billion and $19 billion. But Chief Executive Darren Woods still says 2025 spending could surpass this year’s roughly $23 billion. And shareholders pleas to consider a greener future hasn’t been met with enthusiasm. Woods rarely joins earnings calls. An initiative passed by shareholders to produce a climate report has resulted in no substantive changes to its business.,"Engine No. 1 has sensible recommendations. It wants Exxon to appoint new independent directors with outside energy experience, invest only in projects with lower break-even oil and gas prices, consider using existing skills and scale to invest in growing areas such as renewable energy, and change compensation policy that has resulted in Woods’ pay increasing about 35% over the past two years, according to the activist.","Still Exxon may not be inclined to give in, so Engine has to enlist others. It already has the California State Teachers’ Retirement System on board, which owns a $300 million stake in Exxon. But BlackRock could be next in line. The fund giant’s boss Larry Fink has said that climate change is fundamentally altering investing, and the investment manager voted earlier this year to split Exxon’s two top roles. That could be a big enough fish to fry Exxon."

Exxon has sold assets in Norway for $4.5 billion and has launched processes in Australia, Malaysia and Nigeria.","The launch of a number of processes, including the sale of its British North Sea oil and gas portfolio have been put on hold following the collapse in oil prices, according to sources.","For Exxon, the sale of its operations in Azerbaijan would mark the end of a 25-year involvement.",Exxon and Chevron were among five U.S. oil companies that helped create Azerbaijan’s current oil industry soon after the collapse of the Soviet Union and acquiring a stake in ACG in 1994.,The deal was dubbed by Azerbaijan and partners as the “the contract of the century” thanks to the field’s large reserves and hopes for future major discoveries that would help Europe diversify away from Russian oil and gas.

The entire oil industry has fallen out of favor with investors, but Exxon, once the industry’s cash flow and profit leader, has tumbled particularly hard.","The company is “mindful of the current market environment,” but will stay with its strategy of “leaning in to this market when others have pulled back,” Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods said at the company’s annual investor day meeting. He first laid out plans to improve profit through investment in 2018, and Thursday’s message did not diverge from that.","The industry faces a drop in demand for its products this year as the coronavirus spreads globally, but “the longer term horizon is more clear,” Woods said, arguing that improving living standards mean the world will need more oil.","But Exxon's total share return is minus 26% over the last five years, far behind the other global oil majors, according to Refinitiv Eikon data, while the broader S&P 500 Index .SPX has returned 49%.","The company plans to spend between $30 billion and $35 billion a year through 2025. Spending will rise from $31 billion last year to about $33 billion this year, though Woods said that number could dip if the company needs to adjust for market conditions or if costs come in lower.","Exxon is “playing the long game,” said Anish Kapadia of Palissy Advisors, hoping that its peers’ underinvestment means commodity prices will rise and it will profit.","“However, this is not a strategy that investors are going to buy in to today as they are more focused on where commodity prices are at currently,” Kapadia said, adding, “There is a fear in the market that global demand for hydrocarbons will stagnate or fall” given investor focus on climate.","Investors, including the world’s top asset manager BlackRock, have warned company boards to step up efforts to tackle climate change.","Exxon is “pursuing a strategy that is destructive of both shareholder value and the planet,” said Edward Mason, head of responsible investment at Church Commissioners for England who co-leads climate talks with Exxon and attended Thursday’s meeting.","Some European oil companies have set ambitious climate goals, but Woods said Exxon was focused on reducing its own emissions and would not engage in a “beauty match” with its peers.","Exxon is likely “in for another tough year,” said Biraj Borkhataria, an analyst with RBC Europe Limited. With weak oil and gas prices and muted refining margins, Exxon will “barely” cover its capital spending with free cash flow and its dividend coverage will be “the worst” among the major oil companies, he said.","Its growth plans include a big bet on U.S. shale, where output has surged, making the United States the world’s largest oil producer, and on Guyana, where an Exxon-led consortium has made one of the biggest discoveries in years.","In the Permian Basin, the top U.S. shale field, Exxon has been expanding production rapidly and expects to produce around 360,000 barrels per day this year. It slightly slowed its aggressive pace, the first such move by an oil major in the field as smaller companies slash budgets and lay down equipment.","Exxon has 58 drilling rigs at work now, but said it will drop that number by 20% this year as it picks up drilling speed.","It is racing its closest U.S. rival, Chevron Corp CVX.N, to reach 1 million barrels of oil-equivalent per day there, and Exxon said it still will surpass that target by 2024.","On Tuesday, Chevron said it had up to $80 billion in its war chest that it could use for shareholder returns over the next five years, regardless of oil prices."

A 2019 IMF report here on Guyana said the country's macroeconomic outlook was ""very favorable"" and that oil revenues would improve infrastructure and development.","The government and Exxon both argue favorable fiscal terms were needed to attract investment into an unproven oil play, but the PPP and Global Witness say the government had the upper hand during the 2016 re-negotiation given that Exxon made commercial discoveries in 2015.","“The conclusions are misleading in that they compare Guyana deep water with mature hydrocarbon-producing provinces which naturally have evolved fiscal frameworks reflecting maturity and lower risk profiles,” Exxon spokesman Todd Spitler said of the report.",‘WHAT DO WE DO WITH THE MONEYS’,"To be sure, it is unlikely the election will spur changes to the Exxon deal, as the PPP has stopped short of saying it would renegotiate the contract terms. Hess Chief Executive John Hess said in an investor call last week that both parties were “pretty clear” they would honor the deal.","But the PPP has pledged to improve “contract administration” by requiring Exxon hire more local firms, and promises to re-examine deals with other companies. Opposition leader Bharrat Jagdeo slammed Greenidge’s comments and said the government “sold out our interests.”","“This is very worrying, that Carl Greenidge will go on an APNU platform in New Amsterdam and try to run down a global organization that tackles corruption, and they talk about clean government and honest government?” Jagdeo, a former president, told reporters last Thursday.",Finance Minister Winston Jordan said Exxon’s discovery of oil before the renegotiation of the original agreement - signed during PPP leadership in 1999 - was not the only factor that should be taken into account.,"The country has a century-long border dispute with neighboring Venezuela, and in 2013 Venezuela’s navy seized a ship exploring for oil on behalf of U.S. oil company Anadarko. That incident added risk, Jordan said. Venezuela in late 2018 halted an Exxon ship conducting a seismic survey.","“We can compare today, tomorrow, about what we got and what we didn’t get, but it seems we don’t want to compare objective conditions,” Jordan said in a late January interview.",Global Witness said in its report it did not believe the Venezuela dispute “can be used to adequately justify the exploitative nature of Exxon’s Stabroek deal.”,"Guyana will receive $280 million-$300 million in oil revenues this year, Jordan said. By comparison, total government revenue in 2018 was just $1 billion.","“More energy should be put into what do we do with the moneys,” he said. “That discussion has to take precedence.” (Reporting by Luc Cohen and Neil Marks in Georgetown Additional reporting by Gary McWilliams in Houston Editing by Leslie Adler)"

The other agreement, the Papua LNG pact, was sealed with France’s Total SA in September.","The government was seeking terms on P’nyang that would give the state more than the 45%-50% take that PNG is set to reap on the returns from the Papua LNG project, and well above the terms Exxon negotiated in 2008 for its PNG LNG project, a person close to the negotiations said.","P’nyang and Total’s Papua LNG project were designed to feed three new processing units, called trains, at Exxon’s PNG LNG plant, with the two projects sharing infrastructure in order to save $2 billion to $3 billion dollars on construction costs.","Oil Search said on Monday it would now focus its attention on the Papua LNG project, which will feed two new trains, adding 5.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) to the plant’s 8 mtpa capacity.

Output rose last summer at the depth of the U.S.-China trade dispute, and industry margins for a key polyethylene fell 30% compared with levels between 2016 and 2018, said James Wilson, analyst at pricing provider ICIS.","“The industry ended up overbuilding,” said Pavel Molchanov, an analyst with investment firm Raymond James. “Exxon, of course, is among the companies that led that build-out.”","In refining, outages and higher maintenance costs at Exxon refineries in the United States, Canada and Saudi Arabia hurt profit, according to regulatory filings.","Crude oil prices and slack global demand from the trade dispute are squeezing profit across the industry, said Garfield Miller, chief executive at Aegis Energy Advisors.","This month, an Exxon regulatory filing implied a loss in chemicals of about $200 million for the fourth quarter, and refining earnings of just $400 million.","In contrast, chemicals and refining delivered $7 billion to $11 billion annually for Exxon between 2013 and 2018. In the first nine months of last year, the combined profit was $2.37 billion. Exxon’s regulatory filing indicates 2019 earnings for the two at about $2.52 billion, the lowest in at least a decade.","Woods has halted the company’s oil output declines by ramping up in shale.

So far, results have been tepid. It expects to receive about $3.6 billion from selling Norwegian oil and gas production assets.","Weak demand for those assets comes as rivals have written off the value of their own properties. BP, Chevron, Equinor ASA EQNR.OL, Repsol SA REP.MC and Royal Dutch Shell Plc RDSa.L last year cut a total of $22 billion primarily on U.S. assets due to sharply lower gas prices.

Exxon has denied the allegations.,"** If the New York and Massachusetts lawsuits are successful, other attorneys general could bring similar cases, said Robert Percival, who heads the environmental law program at the University of Maryland.","** In addition to the litigation by attorneys general, Baltimore, Rhode Island and about a dozen local governments have sued oil and gas companies including BP Plc and Chevron Corp over climate change.

They say the lawsuits will do nothing to stop climate change and that they are working to address the issue.,"** Meanwhile, teenagers across the country have filed more than half a dozen lawsuits accusing states and, in one case, the U.S. government of violating their constitutional rights to life, liberty and property by failing to implement policies that curb climate change.

He declined to name any partners, besides Cimarex. Concho, Devon, EOG, Occidental and Exxon declined to comment.","Chevron’s deals, ranging from large-scale joint ventures to small deals where it has leased land to other operators, give it a share of the oil its partners produce.","They also provide data from thousands of wells stretching back years, allowing Chevron to hone drilling strategies. In return, partners get access to areas adjacent to their wells and pipelines, reducing their costs.",Shale drilling has helped the United States reverse decades of declines in output to become the world’s largest oil producer and all the major U.S. oil companies have jumped on the shale bandwagon to boost their own production.,"Unlike conventional oil fields, however, shale wells decline quickly, producing most of their oil in the first few years, so fields such as the Permian Basin require constant, and costly, drilling just to keep production steady.","“If there’s a downside, that’s the downside,” said Jeff Gustavson, who oversees Chevron’s Permian operations. “You’re always having to put more in.”","At a site near Midland, Texas, know-how gleaned from Cimarex and other partners is helping Chevron drill a series of ultra-deep wells - named after the mythical three-headed hound Cerberus - to reach an oil-rich layer more than a mile underground.","The alliances and vast land holdings Chevron can tap allow it to drill longer wells than some rivals, giving it an edge as long wells generally pump more oil and save money.","Chevron said its Permian wells average nearly 9,000 feet (2,743 meters) this year, while consultancy Wood Mackenzie said the industry average is 8,500 feet.

In the Permian, output leapt 56% from a year earlier to 421,000 bpd and Chevron’s goal is to pump 900,000 bpd from the oilfield by 2023.","Chevron’s Gustavson said its long-standing relationships provide it with “all of the data, all of the cost information” from wells across the basin. “It’s a huge advantage.

Exxon is in the top 10 with production of 274,000 bpd.",For a chart of the top Permian land holders:,"Chevron’s mineral rights reduce its breakeven, or the oil price it needs to make a profit, while other savings come from drilling ventures. Chevron operates 20 rigs, far fewer than the 56 Exxon operated in June and Occidental-Anadarko’s 27.",But Chevron estimates its partners contributed the equivalent of another seven to 10 rigs.,"Cimarex struck a small deal with Chevron in 2009 to drill on its land and share data, and then broadened the agreement in 2013, said Michael DeShazer, Permian manager at Cimarex.","He said the two companies were able to learn faster, deploy faster and, by sharing resources, they could more easily invest in infrastructure such as pipelines, roads and electricity.","Shale output drops sharply the first year and declines 80% to 90% over two to three years, but Chevron has been able to slow the decrease.","In the formation near Midland, Chevron’s wells lost 52% of their output after the first 12 months compared with an average decline of 70% for rivals, according to IHS Markit.

There are assets available in Norway and the UK. We expect to remain active in these markets,” DNO’s Executive Chairman Bijan Mossavar-Rahmani told a quarterly result presentation.",He told Reuters later that the company was also looking at the assets Exxon Mobil is seeking to sell.,"“We are looking because that gives us market information, and maybe opportunities (to buy),” he said.","DNO completed its $780 million purchase of Faroe Petroleum in March 2019, and said it had a $574 million cash balance at the end of the second quarter.","It said it would focus on buying assets which are already producing or under development as it seeks to increase its North Sea output to 50,000 barrels of oil equivalents per day (boepd) in 2021 from around 14,692 boepd in the second quarter.","“It’s an ambitious target, but it’s doable.

With little cash from asset sales and a third straight quarter of weaker year-over-year earnings, Exxon cannot resume share buybacks sought by investors this year, said analysts.","Chief Executive Darren Woods this year set a target of raising $15 billion by trimming its portfolio through 2021, above the average $3.3 billion a year rate between 2017 and 2013. The sales could include more oil-producing properties, compared with prior deals mostly in refining and marketing, he said.","But those goals are proving difficult. In its first quarter, proceeds from sales were just $107 million, the lowest in at least 11 quarters, and analysts expect the second quarter to come in at a similar level. Exxon last quarter agreed to sell a U.S. Gulf of Mexico property for $200 million.","“There’s not enough cash flow for buybacks, which is what people want to see,” said Jennifer Rowland, analyst at Edward Jones, who has a “hold” rating on Exxon. Exxon may have to use debt to help fund its shareholder dividend, she said.","A package of offshore Gulf of Mexico oilfields that Exxon put on the market last autumn has languished, said analysts. More recently, the company has begun to market offshore properties in Nigeria and Norway, according to analysts and people familiar with the matter. Any one could raise several billion dollars in a sale, the people said.","Stephen Greenlee, who oversees divestitures as president of Exxon’s Upstream Business Development group, was not available to address the asset sales, an Exxon spokesman said.","Exxon shares are rated a ""buy"" by just 23% of analysts, below BP PLC's BP.L at 71%, Chevron Corp's CVX.N 74%, Royal Dutch Shell's RDSa.L 80% and Total SA's TOTF.PA 89%, according to Refinitiv.","“The market is not ready to pay what Exxon thinks these assets are worth,” William Turner, a vice president at researcher Welligence, said of the offshore U.S. properties. “A lot of the recent transactions in the Gulf of Mexico have been going at discounted valuations.”","Exxon’s pitches are not the only going unanswered, said a U.S. merger and acquisition advisor who requested anonymity speaking about M&A matters. “There has been less activity. I’m not sure if it is the bid/ask or something else; but they just aren’t there,” the person said.",There is no doubt Exxon’s cash could use a boost. Analysts slashed earnings forecasts to 79 cents a share from 97 cents after the company disclosed operating unit expectations this month.,"""We expect another large funding gap this quarter,” wrote Cowen COWN.O analyst Jason Gabelman, who estimated Exxon's organic free cash flow this quarter will not cover the $3.7 billion needed for dividends.","The two areas expected to show improved margins during the period, crude sales and refining, were offset by weaker natural gas prices and higher maintenance costs. The result was “another disappointing quarter,” wrote Biraj Borkhataria, analyst at RBC Capital Markets, in a client note.","Exxon has been investing to boost production in the Permian Basin, the top U.S. shale field, and in offshore Guyana.

The problem is if they don’t get that soon, they just won’t be here,” ACCC Chairman Rod Sims told reporters at the conference.","However, analysts said imported LNG was unlikely to be this cheap given the distance it has to travel, with new local supplies needed to bring certainty of supply and potentially cheaper prices.","“We are going to have a shortfall from 2021, and new infrastructure in some form is going to be needed to service that,” said Nicholas Mumford, managing director of Mumford Commercial Consulting."

And the volume is insufficient for ExxonMobil and its partner Qatar Petroleum to feed a two-train LNG plant – which had been the partnership’s goal,” he said.",He said Exxon may instead look to cooperate with Calypso finders Eni and Total. “A joint development would potentially serve up enough gas to support a greenfield LNG development.”

However, these proxy figures frequently were not used in its internal planning or cost assumptions, the suit claims.","The company also failed to properly account for such costs in determining its volume of oil and gas reserves, or whether to write down the value of its assets, a metric important to investors, the suit claims.","“The company claimed to be factoring the risk of increasing climate change regulation into its business decisions,” Attorney General Barbara Underwood said in a statement. “Yet as our investigation found, Exxon often did no such thing.”","Exxon “looks forward to refuting these claims as soon as possible and getting this meritless civil lawsuit dismissed,” said spokesman Scott Silvestri in a statement.","He further described the suit as the “product of closed-door lobbying by special interests, political opportunism and the attorney general’s inability to admit that a three-year investigation has uncovered no wrongdoing.”","The suit was brought under the Martin Act, a civil statute that has been used by New York prosecutors to pursue fraud claims against investment and other financial companies.","“In bringing this case, the state is yet again using the Martin Act as a political weapon,” said Lisa Rickard, president of the U.S. Chamber Institute for Legal Reform, calling the case “nothing more than a contortion of the securities litigation system.”",Exxon unsuccessfully fought to halt the New York investigation and a similar probe by the state of Massachusetts that claims Exxon misled consumers with its statements on climate change.,"“This is a very significant lawsuit,” said Ken Kimmell, president of the Union of Concerned Scientists. “The New York state attorney general has gotten a lot of documents and we should assume they filed the suit based on the information received during that process.”","Exxon and other oil companies including BP Plc BP.L, Chevron Corp CVX.N and Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.AS face lawsuits by cities and counties across the United States seeking funds to pay for seawalls and other infrastructure to guard against rising sea levels brought on by climate change."

After several years investigating the company’s communications with shareholders, Barbara Underwood unveiled a suit that claims the $340 billion oil giant has misled investors about how climate change regulation would affect its business. Shareholders weren’t dupes, though. Their revolt last year forced the company to start addressing the issue. Legal heat should prod Exxon’s owners to demand more than baby steps.","The world’s largest independent, publicly-traded oil company was already on the defensive with climate change. Last year shareholders voted to demand that the company disclose more about how carbon-related environmental risks would affect its business. Then there are the rolling lawsuits, including one earlier this year when two California cities sought to make Exxon pay for coastal flooding.","The New York state AG’s lawsuit claims that Exxon didn’t properly account for future regulatory changes when it was valuing its businesses. Exxon called the claims “baseless” and said it is looking forward to refuting them. The company has some tricks up its sleeve. With California, for example, it used some of the government’s disclosures in bond documents to show that the municipalities had hedged their assumptions about climate change when it was trying to raise debt.","Exxon, under pressure from shareholders, has made some changes since Chief Executive Darren Woods took over from Rex Tillerson at the beginning of last year. In March the company attempted to address shareholder concerns about the effect of climate during its investor day. This summer it ended its association with a conservative political lobby group. Then earlier this month it said it made a donation to a campaign that is working to promote a U.S. tax on carbon-gas emissions.","None of that yet amounts to a thorough investigation of the climate risks in Exxon’s businesses. Nor has it mattered much to what shareholders care about the most: Exxon’s stock price. The shares are down almost 8 percent since Woods took over, after accounting for dividends, worse than the energy sector overall. Shareholders have mostly gone quiet, however, and they didn’t urge further action at this year’s annual meeting in May. New York’s lawsuit may just jolt some of them back into action."

Gazprom has the exclusive rights to export pipeline gas from Russia.","Sakhalin-1 has to pump most of the gas back into the ground, while a small amount goes to local customers in the sparsely populated region. Decade-long talks with Gazprom and the consortium over gas sales have not yet yielded any results.","Rosneft, ONGC and SODECO declined to comment. The Russian Energy Ministry and the government also declined to make any immediate comment.","“The Sakhalin-1 consortium continues to explore every opportunity to monetize Sakhalin-1 gas resources,” an ExxonMobil spokeswoman in Moscow said in emailed comments sent in response to Reuters questions.","Igor Sechin, Rosneft chief executive, said in June that the LNG plant would be built just across the Tatarsky strait in the port of De Kastri in Russia’s Khabarovsk region, where Rosneft already has an export terminal for Sakhalin-1 oil.","Sechin said then that the plant’s annual capacity was seen at 6 million tonnes of LNG, with supplies aimed at starting in 2025.

Exxon now aims to trade around more of its growing energy assets to get the best prices for its products and increase earnings, according to an employee familiar with the matter.","Expanded trading could add hundreds of millions of dollars to annual earnings from its own buying and selling of crude and fuels, but also comes with problems, including higher risk. Exxon XOM.N expects to add 1 million barrels per day of output over the next several years as new oilfields and refinery expansions kick in, giving it more assets to trade.","Exxon last year retained John Masek, a former trader at Swiss-based Glencore GLEN.L, the world's second largest buyer and seller of petroleum, to consult on gasoline trading. Earlier this year, it poached four gasoline market specialists from refiner Phillips 66 PSX.N.","This month, Exxon hired former BHP Billiton Plc BLT.L trader Nelson Lee as an international crude trader, the people familiar with the matter said. In 2014, Lee orchestrated BHP's first-ever crude exports by maintaining the lightly refined oil met criteria for an exportable product. The deals helped usher in the end to a U.S. prohibition on crude exports more than a year later.","The company has also added crude, products and liquefied natural gas specialists to London and Singapore offices. It recently hired Paul Butcher, a trader who has worked at BP Plc BP.L, Glencore and Vitol, to advise on North Sea markets and accounting for trading transactions.","“Paul is known for being a very aggressive, old school crude trader. Exxon would have never hired a risk taker of that scale in the old days. The fact that he is consulting them shows they are considering changes in trading very seriously,” said a trading house executive who knows Butcher.",Phillips 66 declined to comment on the employee departures.,"Exxon spokesman Scott Silvestri referred questions about its trading business and recent hiring to regulatory filings, which note the historical use of financial derivatives and geographic scale to manage commodity price risks.","Chief Executive Darren Woods wants to increase Exxon’s profit and appetite for risk at a measured pace, according to people who deal with Exxon. The U.S. operation runs from a trading floor at its Spring, Texas campus that has expanded to as many as 70 workers who will handle everything from Canadian crude to gasoline, jet fuel and diesel.","“Trading has been a virtual four-letter word at Exxon,” said Ehud Ronn, a University of Texas finance professor who studies energy and financial risk management. Exxon has drawn most top managers from engineering backgrounds, not financial services. “A change in their trading policy would indeed be transformational.”","Exxon has long lagged behind rivals BP Plc BP.L, Chevron Corp CVX.N and Royal Dutch Shell Plc RDSa.L, which have created trading units that occasionally generate more profit than their refining businesses.","During the oil price downturn of 2015-2016, companies like Shell RDSa.L often made more profit in refining than in oil production, also known as upstream, and often cited trading as contributing to the success of the refining division.","Shell for example trades more than 8 million barrels per day or 8 percent of global production, twice the size of its own or Exxon’s output. The huge figures come partially thanks to trading barrels of third parties, which Exxon currently does on a very limited scale.","Exxon would also normally hedge only cargoes going from one region to another and where crude is priced according to different benchmarks. BP and Shell would normally hedge all cargoes as well as taking sometimes a pure speculative position on the paper market to make profit, according to traders working for the firms.","“Exxon still doesn’t plan to begin speculative paper trading,” said one source familiar with Exxon’s thinking.",Woods faces pressure from Exxon investors to lift shares that trade at the same price as 10 years ago. He promised shareholders this year that he can double profit and increase its oil and gas output by 25 percent by 2025.,"The company’s expanded focus on trading brings challenges including added risk from options, swaps and other derivatives, and developing risk-management and compensation systems for the larger business.","Exxon has held talks with at least two developers of risk-management software, Enuit LLC and Allegro Development Corp, people familiar with the discussions said. Both offer packages that manage logistics and measure financial exposure. The companies declined to comment on their discussions with Exxon, according to spokespeople.","Exxon has also put company veteran managers in charge of overall trading and risk controls at its Spring, Texas, floor, one person familiar with its operations said, to avoid potential losses as it expands trading.","“We’ve heard whispers in the market about this for a few years, so it’s great to see them finally hiring commercial talent externally,” said an executive recruiter familiar with some of the recent hires but who was not directly involved."

As freshwater is a scarce resource in Iraq, using treated seawater is one of the best alternatives.","The Common Seawater Supply Project (CSSP), which would supply water to more than six southern oilfields, including Exxon's existing West Qurna 1 field and BP's BP.L Rumaila, was initially planned to be completed in 2013 but has now been delayed until 2022.","“The CSSP would be expensive and challenging but there’s opportunity here (for Exxon) ... to get access to resources on a very large scale and to achieve something and really make a difference to its own business,” said Ian Thom, principal analyst at consultancy Wood Mackenzie.","Many of the world's biggest oil companies, like BP, Total TOTF.PA, Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L and Eni ENI.MI, have operations in Iraq, where a low-return environment and strict contract terms have squeezed returns in recent years.","With total oil production at West Qurna 1 at around 430,000 bpd, Exxon’s presence in Iraq is small compared with dominant player BP whose Rumaila oilfield accounts for around a third of the country’s total production of around 4.4 million bpd.","While the Texas-based firm is looking to grow in Iraq, its geographical focus remains on the Americas, including U.S. shale fields and Brazil, in contrast to rivals like France’s Total and Italy’s Eni who have been significantly expanding their activities in the Middle East in recent years.",‘ANOTHER APPROACH’,"The talks between Iraqi authorities and Exxon are still ongoing, according to the industry sources and officials from the Iraqi oil ministry.","However the state-run Basra Oil Company (BOC), which is overseeing the project, said it could now tender the project this month in a parallel process with the aim of completing a first phase by 2022.","“We have this one approach but we can have another approach as well,” Abdul Mahdi al-Ameedi, head of the Iraqi oil ministry’s licensing and contracts office, told Reuters.","Iraq chose Exxon to coordinate the initial studies of the CSSP in 2010 [story here here]. At the time, Baghdad aimed to raise its oil production capacity to 12 million barrels per day (bpd) by 2018, rivaling Saudi Arabia. That target has been missed and now been cut to 6.5 million bpd by 2022 from around 5 million bpd now.","“Iraq can probably get to 5.5 million bpd production without a major seawater supply project, but I think they will struggle to get to 7 million bpd,” said Thom.","Negotiations with Exxon fell through in 2012 due to red tape and cost disputes.
