We are committed to transition New Jersey to 100% clean energy by 2050,” Murphy said.",PennEast obtained approval from the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to build the pipeline in January 2018 and promptly sued in federal court to use the federal government’s eminent domain power to gain access to 131 properties along the route in New Jersey under the U.S. Natural Gas Act.,"New Jersey did not consent to PennEast’s condemnation suits on properties it controls. The state holds interests in most of the properties through easements requiring the land be preserved for recreational, conservation or agricultural use.","PennEast needs the land to build its 120-mile (190-km) pipeline, which is designed to deliver gas from the Marcellus shale formation in Pennsylvania to customers in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.","Patricia Kornick, a spokeswoman for PennEast, said the company “is confident the legal actions will be resolved favorably and the long-standing legal precedent under which FERC has operated ... will be upheld.”",The company has said it anticipates starting construction on the pipeline in 2020.,"The companies seeking to build the PennEast pipeline include units of New Jersey Resources Corp (NJR), South Jersey Industries Inc (SJI), Southern Co, Enbridge Inc and UGI Corp.","The companies with contracts to use the project include units of NJR, SJI, Southern, Public Service Enterprise Group Inc and Consolidated Edison Inc.","PennEast is not the only gas pipeline facing state opposition in the U.S. Northeast. Two of Williams Cos Inc’s proposed pipelines are facing state opposition, including Constitution in New York and Northeast Supply Enhancement in New Jersey."
