The Pennsylvania-based chocolate company found that searches for those products on Pinterest increased in early March, with search volumes for related hashtags increasing more than 1,000% year-over-year.","Based on the trend, Hershey moved quickly to add recipes incorporating Hershey Cadbury crème eggs and Hershey chocolate syrup to the company’s own “Easter” and “Cakes and Cupcakes” boards on Pinterest.","“We are looking at different social sites like Pinterest and we leverage those insights with retailers. ... It definitely is more than usual (this year),” Philip Stanley, Hershey’s chief sales officer, said in a recent telephone interview.","Shoppers plan to spend an average of $179.70 this Easter, the highest figure on record, according to a March 2021 survey of 8,111 respondents conducted by consumer research firm Prosper Insights & Analytics for the National Retail Federation, the U.S. retail trade association.","The COVID-19 pandemic has made it harder for retailers and food companies to predict where and how people will shop. More than two-thirds of Americans will celebrate this weekend’s Easter holiday and spend a collective $21.6 billion, the federation added, with 13% of respondents saying they will shop in a store. This compares with 9% of respondents saying the same in a pre-pandemic survey last year.","“Consumer behavior change was so rapid during COVID, our normal cycle of understanding our annual rituals with our products and consumer insights was not the same,” Hershey spokeswoman Allison Kleinfelter said by phone.","Pinterest operates like an online mood board, where users pin images they like to several different interest-specific boards on their page. These images can then be shared and pinned between users, creating what Pinterest Inc calls “a catalogue of ideas.”","“Because Pinterest is grounded in the future, it gets an earlier indication of where consumers are headed and can help brands better predict what’s to come for their category,” Sibylle Tretera, head of creative strategy for Europe, Middle East and Africa at Pinterest, wrote in a December blog post.","Jonathan Halvorson, global vice president of consumer experience at Mondelez International Inc, said by phone that the Chicago-based company had tripled its marketing budget on Pinterest over the last two years, without giving a specific number. Halvorson said the platform “had made the biggest progression on insights” on which it could act upon, including for Easter.","To be sure, the maker of Oreo cookies still spends the majority of its social media marketing budget on Alphabet Inc’s Google and Facebook, but nevertheless has increased its brand campaigns on Pinterest.",Cadbury’s UK unit was among the first brands to use Pinterest’s Trend Badges feature when it launched in 2020 - which gave advertisers the exclusive opportunity to spotlight their own products based on trending search terms.,"“We’re able to get insight into things like when during the day – morning, evening, meal time, etc. – consumers are searching for snacks, what kind, and where they’re looking to buy them,” said Halvorson of social media sites, including Pinterest.","Even as far back as mid-February, shortly after Valentine’s Day, Pinterest users, who call themselves “Pinners,” showed an interest in baking at home, leading Hershey to focus on 10-ounce (284-gram) Hershey’s kisses and seasonal Reese’s miniatures pieces.","When people posted images suggesting they were planning to take part in more at-home activities, community-led Easter egg hunts and barbecues in the two weeks before Easter Sunday, Hershey focused on selling limited-time products such as Reese’s mallow-top peanut butter cups, as it found marshmallows to be popular around this season.","“It all just shifted so quickly,” Hershey spokeswoman Kleinfelter said, “so social media was really critical in understanding the quick sweeps (in consumer behavior) that we were seeing and when these quick sweeps (are) happening."

But he took a chance and now rings up to 3,500 rupees ($50) in Silk bar sales a month.","“Villagers can afford premium chocolates now,” he said.","As Satish and other Harohalli shopkeepers have found chocolate sales in India are taking off, helped by growth in disposable incomes that extends to the country’s 650,000 poorer villages where more than two-thirds of the population reside.","A boom in e-commerce and a sharp tax cut are also propelling sales higher, spurring global confectioners like Mondelez International Inc, Nestle SA NESN.S and relative newcomer Hershey Co HSY.N to invest further in the still small but rapidly expanding market.","Illinois-based Mondelez, India’s No.1 chocolate maker, told Reuters “the big bulk” of a $150 million increase in global investment this year - the first hike in five years - will be in rural India.","The company, which first started providing Indian store owners with free display coolers in early 2000s, ramped up their distribution to rural areas over the last year. It now plans to be in about 75,000-100,000 villages in the next three years, up from 50,000 in 2018.","To that end, it is also expanding its fleet of refrigerated trucks and building a database that maps India’s small neighborhood stores and monitors sales of its products at those shops.","“There’s a misconception that rural consumers are poor. Not all of them are. There are rich farmers, who are coming into the consuming class,” Deepak Iyer, Mondelez’s managing director for India told Reuters.","Iyer said Mondelez was targeting villages with as few as 3,000 people. “There are families aspiring for premium products because they see them through mobile connectivity today.”",Mondelez CEO Dirk Van de Put said competitors will find it hard to match the firm’s scale in the country.,"Cadbury’s vast, decades-old distribution network in India was a key attraction for Kraft Food in its $19.6 billion takeover of the brand in 2010. Kraft later split into two firms with its global snacks business renamed Mondelez.","“It’s not going to be easy (for rivals) to carve out space, to be really be noticed in the store,” he said an interview, adding that Mondelez has consistently grown market share in India for several years.","Mondelez says it now commands 66% of the Indian chocolate market. Cadbury, a 195-year old British confectionery brand, entered India in 1948 and its Dairy Milk, Silk and 5Star products have since made it a household name. The Dairy Milk brand alone accounts for 40% of the market.","Nestle is ranked No.2, followed by Ferrero and Hershey, according to Euromonitor. The companies have not disclosed market share estimates.","At $1.9 billion in annual sales, India has plenty of room to grow. China, also a developing economy with a similar population size, is a $3.2 billion market but both pale in comparison to the U.S. market of $19.2 billion, Euromonitor data shows.","Last year, chocolate sales in India jumped 15.4% after the government, keen to win re-election, overhauled its national sales tax for many items. The cut in tax to 18% from 28% reduced chocolate retail prices and companies nearly tripled the amount they spent on promotions, according to market research firm Nielsen.","Mondelez says its Cadbury brand, which has worked for decades with WPP's WPP.L Ogilvy India on Bollywood star-studded TV ads, is spending more on marketing. And to tap online demand, the company has created a Cadbury-only store on Amazon.com AMZN.O that personalizes gift boxes for India's year-round festivals.","It is also introducing new products. Last month, it launched a low-sugar Dairy Milk bar, addressing a growing market for healthier products in India where 9% of adults have diabetes.","Nestle, the world’s biggest packaged foods company, has also been investing in counter-top coolers, expanding distribution, running celebrity ads and launching premium products. Last year, it began importing its “hand-crafted artisanal” Les Recettes De L’Atelier bars from Europe.",Hershey is doing its best to catch up.,It entered India’s chocolate market in 2016 with its lesser known Brookside brand and announced plans the next year to spend $50 million in five years.,"Rapid growth has come with the introduction of its 112-year-old Kisses brand last autumn, helping it replace Mars as India’s No. 4 chocolate company, although its products are only available in 14 cities and major online stores like Amazon.com, BigBasket.com and Flipkart.com.","“We’re at an early stage...we will extend this by going national and subsequently we’ll look at going down from urban to rural,” Herjit Bhalla, Hershey India’s managing director, told Reuters.","The unit had spent more than expected over the past year, funding celebrity ad campaigns and technology including hand-held devices that analyze store preferences, Bhalla said.","India’s e-commerce market is a priority, he added, with online orders accounting for over 4% of sales, higher than the 1% seen for India’s overall consumer goods market."
