It ordered the trial judge, Kevin Castel, to recalculate Walters’ $8.88 million in restitution to Dean Foods in light of a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision.","Circuit Judge Dennis Jacobs, in a concurring opinion, called Chaves’ leaks “in some respects more egregious” than Walters’ crimes.","“The FBI depends on the confidence of the public, jurors and judges,” Jacobs wrote. “That confidence is critical to its mission; so this kind of thing is very bad for business.”","Alexandra Shapiro, a lawyer for Walters, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman in Manhattan declined to comment.",Walters had built an estimated $200 million fortune as one of the most successful U.S. sports betters.,"He had maintained his innocence, and told reporters after his conviction: “I just did lose the biggest bet of my life.”","The case drew added attention because of Walters’ relationships with billionaire investor Carl Icahn and champion golfer Phil Mickelson, neither of whom was criminally charged.","Mickelson, who once had gambling debts to Walters, agreed in May 2016 to forfeit $1.03 million he made on Dean Foods shares to settle a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission civil case.","The case is U.S. v.
