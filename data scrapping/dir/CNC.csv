The firm led by Henry Kravis is requesting advisers like law and accounting firms to discount their bills for work performed by some 15% this year, the Financial Times reports. KKR – whose shares have rallied 60% since the March bottom – is using “share the pain” altruism in its appeal, according to the paper. It’s not quite akin to stiffing service providers, as advisers may view discounts as a price to swallow for future business.

That means insurers spend less – but customer premiums come just the same. Moreover, laid-off workers are switching from private health plans to Medicaid, the government-backed program. Most of Centene’s revenue comes from administering such policies, so it wins both ways.","Where’s the catch? It’s simply that there’s a danger in profiting too much from a national crisis.
