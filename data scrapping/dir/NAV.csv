Moves by regulators to phase out internal combustion engines have energized a race to develop commercial vehicles powered by either batteries or hydrogen fuel cells.","Navistar said it plans to offer its International RH Series fuel-cell truck - powered by GM fuel cells - in model year 2024. The target driving range is more than 500 miles, with a hydrogen fueling time of less than 15 minutes. Financial terms were not disclosed.","Hydrogen fuel company OneH2, in which Navistar will take a undisclosed minority stake, will supply a fueling solution and incorporate more than 2,000 of the trucks into existing customer fleets. In addition, J.B. Hunt Transport Services will be the first customer to use the truck.","“Hydrogen fuel cells offer great promise for heavy-duty trucks in applications requiring a higher density of energy, fast refueling and additional range,” Navistar Chief Executive Persio Lisboa said.","Hydrogen backers say it is cleaner than other carbon-cutting technologies because water and heat are the only byproducts and it can be made from numerous sources, including methane, coal, water, and even garbage. Fuel cell vehicles remain a niche technology, as there are not many fueling stations and potential customers also worry about resale values and the risk of hydrogen explosions.","For long-haul transport, proponents say hydrogen-powered trucks have an advantage over electric rivals as they have a greater range and require less time to charge. But they are expensive so their uptake and mass production has been slow.","Last November, Illinois-based Navistar and engine maker Cummins said they would work together on a fuel-cell Class 8 truck. Navistar is also developing battery electric trucks.","Also that month, Volkswagen AG’s truck unit Traton SE agreed to pay $3.7 billion for the outstanding shares of Navistar it doesn’t already own. That deal is expected to close in mid-2021.",Wednesday’s deal comes less than two months after GM announced a non-binding agreement to supply fuel cells to startup Nikola. GM said that deal is not affected by the Navistar agreement.,"Under its agreement with Nikola, which must be finalized by year end, GM will supply its fuel-cell system for Nikola’s Class 7 and 8 commercial semi-trucks","Nikola expects to begin testing prototypes of its fuel-cell trucks by year end, and will break ground on its first commercial hydrogen station in the second quarter.",Nikola has also said it will launch its Tre electric semi-truck with CNH Industrial in the fourth quarter.,"Korea’s Hyundai in December said it was launching a brand dedicated to its hydrogen fuel-cell system, and last year delivered its first H2 Xcient fuel-cell trucks to customers.","Japan’s Toyota has said a demonstration version off its heavy-duty fuel-cell truck, developed with subsidiary Hino Motor Co, would be ready in the first half of 2021.","Germany’s Daimler last June established a separate fuel-cell business unit, and previously announced a team-up with Volvo Trucks to develop fuel-cell systems for heavy-duty vehicles.","Tesla is aiming to compete for commercial customers with its electric Semi truck, which it expects to begin selling this year."

(Reuters) - U.S. truck maker Navistar International Corp NAV.N said on Thursday it will invest more than $250 million in a new, more efficient truck plant in San Antonio, Texas, that will produce three different sized trucks and create around 600 jobs.","The new plant follows an announcement from Navistar in June that it would invest $125 million in its Huntsville, Alabama, engine plant as part of an alliance with German truck maker Traton 8TRA.DE.","Navistar will make Class 6, Class 7 and Class 8 trucks on the same production line in San Antonio. Class 8 trucks, or semi-trucks, are America’s biggest trucks and haul goods along the country’s highways.","Speaking ahead of an investor day on Thursday at Navistar’s Lisle, Illinois, headquarters, Chief Executive Officer Troy Clarke told Reuters that the plant, which will run two shifts more consistently than its older facilities and move between different truck sizes on the same line, was part of the company’s long range plans to raise its margins.","Navistar told investors Thursday it plans to raise its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margin to 10% by 2022 and 12% by 2024, from the 8% margin it expects in 2019.","“The engine (in Huntsville) and the (Texas) plant won’t be what gets us to 10% by 2022, but they will be part of what gets us from 10% to 12% in 2024,” Clarke said. “This will have a longer range effect.”","Navistar will break ground on the new plant later this year and launch production around 24 months after that, which Clarke said should come as the U.S. truck market is on an upswing.","North American orders for Class 8 trucks - of which the U.S. forms the vast majority - have slumped this year after hitting a record of nearly 500,000 in 2018, but truck makers have had a good year so far in 2019 as they worked through large order backlogs. Fleets have plenty of trucks and slowing U.S. economic growth has left many reluctant to order new trucks.","Navistar CEO Clarke said he expects industry Class 8 sales to drop around 20% in 2020, but the impact on the company would offset by its school bus and medium-duty truck businesses.","“Next year will be a good year for Navistar, it just won’t be a great year,” Clarke said.","Navistar said on Thursday it expects 2020 EBITDA in a range from $775 million to $825 million. Analysts have forecast 2020 EBITDA of $794.8 million, according to Refinitiv I/B/E/S.",The company expects 2020 revenue of between $10 billion and $10.5 billion. Analysts have predicted revenue of $10.6 billion.,"In 2016, Traton parent company Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE agreed an engine technology and purchasing alliance with Navistar and bought a 16.6 percent stake in the U.S. firm.","Navistar said on Thursday it is on track to achieve savings of $500 million in the first five years of that alliance, with $200 million in annual savings in the fifth year.","When VW bought the stake, it was widely anticipated the German company would eventually buy all of Navistar.",VW floated an 11.5% stake in Traton in June to give unit to greater independence to pursue growth. Traton executives have made clear they are in no hurry to take over Navistar completely and Clarke echoed that point.,"“Is it (a complete takeover) on their agenda? I would assume so,” Clarke said. “But it’s not something that we anticipate in an imminent nature and it’s okay, we’re getting that we need today.”"

The tariffs would increase monthly to up to 25% on Oct. 1.","This could hurt carmakers and auto parts suppliers, who have been making vehicles and parts in Mexico for years, taking advantage of the country’s cheap labor, trade deals and proximity to the United States, the world’s second largest auto market after China.","“Potential tariffs on Mexico would be a significant headwind,” said JP Morgan analyst Ann Duignan in a note, adding that about 57% of the company’s truck production in Mexico could be subject to tariffs.","Navistar, however, raised its 2019 revenue forecast to $11.25 billion-$11.75 billion from $10.75 billion-$11.25 billion. The outlook does not include the impact of the possible tariffs.","The company beat second quarter estimates for adjusted profit and revenue helped by higher sales of class 6-8 truck, buses in the United States and Canada.","Excluding items, Navistar earned $1.06 per share on revenue of $3 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of 89 cents per share on revenue of $2.7 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.","Shares of the company, which rose as much as 9.2%, pared gains to trade up about 4% at $32.39 by late morning."
