Riyadh’s Public Investment Fund may have found the perfect time to board ship. The country’s sovereign wealth fund has built an 8% stake in Carnival, the cruise group at the waterborne epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic. The company’s shares, down 83% for the year as of Friday, jumped more than 25% on Monday after it persuaded bond and stock investors to stump up $6.25 billion last week – albeit at a pricey 11.5% coupon for senior secured debt.","Carnival’s bosses reckon they now have enough cash for at least 12 months, despite some $1 billion of monthly outgoings and no clue when their ships will sail again. PIF’s stake, which it bought in the market, according to the Financial Times, was worth $369 million at Friday’s close. By Monday, at least, the bet had paid off, soaring by nearly $100 million in value. (By Richard Beales)","WILDFIRE VICTIMS CATCH VIRUS, TOO. California utility PG&E’s complex settlement to emerge from bankruptcy is becoming a bit more tenuous thanks to the pandemic. America’s biggest utility went bust in 2019 after a series of wildfires left it on the hook for damages. In an unusual exit, the company agreed to give victims $13.5 billion, half in stock. The snag is, lawyers for some victims now say they aren’t getting as much as the headline suggests.","The shares being given to the victims’ trust are valued at 14.9 times an estimate of net income. That’s rather rich considering rival Edison International trades at about 11 times forecast earnings for 2021. Receiving overvalued shares is a greater concern after the global market swoon induced by the coronavirus. Victims do get a vote, and they could threaten the agreement and possibly the company’s bankruptcy-exit plan. It won’t be the only stock-based deal of one sort or another that’s at risk thanks to the pandemic. (By Robert Cyran)","INSURANCE COMPANIES OFFER UNEXPECTED DIVIDENDS. Money is tight for many people, and insurance companies need coverage that their customers won’t cancel policies. So they are racing to give cash back. Allstate is providing more than $600 million to customers over the next two months and American Family Insurance is giving back $200 million of premiums. With so many customers sheltering in place, there simply aren’t that many accidents. Both companies cited fewer claims.","Falling accident rates – and generous insurance companies – won’t be the pandemic’s only silver lining. Past recessions have consistently led to increases in life expectancy. In addition to fewer accidents, when people aren’t working, they sleep more, exercise more, drink less and smoke fewer cigarettes. The effects may be even greater this time because of sharp cutbacks in pollution. Actuaries’ pencils may be working overtime, though, when the pandemic’s end brings on a renewed vigor in getting out and about. (By Robert Cyran)","LIGHT TOUCH. Struggling UK department store Debenhams on Monday confirmed it intends to go into administration, amid the fallout from the coronavirus lockdown. The twist, however, is that the 207-year-old business won’t restructure its debts, or be liquidated, as would typically happen when a company fails. Instead, an administrator has been appointed who will keep the existing management team in place, and creditors will not enforce their claims for a period. With any luck, Debenhams will be able to continue trading once the lockdown is lifted.","Such “light-touch” administrations are rare in the UK, although they have been possible under Britain’s insolvency law for many years. Creditors typically want to get whatever money back they can, while companies are keen to restructure debt as soon as possible. Yet, because of the lockdown it is hard to value companies, and lenders are wary of a fire sale. That means it’s probably easier for all to give a sickly company time. With about 20% of its sales coming from the online channel, there are good reasons to keep Debenhams running through the lockdown, rather than shutting up shop.

The virus hit sales, and now it looks like historic revenue was wildly inflated too. With shares down nearly 90% this year, short-selling China bears Muddy Waters and Kynikos Associates look smug. Likewise pleased, perhaps, is American Senator Marco Rubio, who wants to delist Chinese firms that don’t allow full U.S. oversight of mainland auditors.","Beijing cannot be happy with Luckin’s founders Lu Zhengyao and Qian Zhiya. Investors are even dumping shares in Hong Kong-listed CAR, where Lu is chairman and Qian was once chief operating officer. Shares in other U.S.-listed Chinese firms could end up as collateral damage. Locals are rushing to use their Luckin coffee coupons while they are still honoured. Investigators have named the chief operating officer as the primary suspect. The buck might not stop there.

The Abu Dhabi hospital operator – which last month said its debt was $6.6 billion, much of it previously undisclosed – hopes to make the best of a bad situation. Executive Chairman Faisal Belhoul is trying to avoid going into administration, arguing over the weekend that it could cause disruption to the company’s 200 hospitals and clinics at a time when it was playing an ”important role” in the United Arab Emirate’s Covid-19 response. NMC is already failing to pay staff on time, raising fears that it can’t hobble on.","Either way, the saga has infected NMC’s lenders. The UAE’s biggest banks have so far fessed up to owning around $2 billion of the debt pile, with the latest disclosures made on Sunday. That means a significant portion of the remaining debt could still be on European bank balance sheets just as they face the enormous task of keeping lockdown-hit companies afloat with cheap loans. Belhoul’s hopes that Covid-19 can be his company’s saviour will be cold comfort to NMC’s creditors. (By Dasha Afanasieva)"

The news release on the Tubbs fire was issued at about 3:10 p.m. EST, according to CAL FIRE spokesman Scott McLean.","“Even if it was just a lotto ticket trade, it’s an extreme case of leverage paying off,” said Henry Schwartz, president of Trade Alert in New York.","On Wednesday, another 10,000 call contracts betting on PG&E Corp shares rising above $10 by Feb. 1 were bought for $300,000. By the close of trading on Thursday, on paper these contracts were worth $4.7 million.","The two trades are likely to have been made by the same trader, Schwartz said, adding that they are likely to invite regulators’ scrutiny.","Options activity has been known to spike before the public announcement of deals and other news that tends to move stock prices, and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has in the past announced enforcement action for alleged insider trading involving options."

That would include the Camp Fire, the state’s deadliest, in 2018.","“Regardless of today’s announcement, PG&E still faces extensive litigation, significant potential liabilities and a deteriorating financial situation,” the utility said in a statement.","As of Thursday afternoon, PG&E still planned to seek bankruptcy protection around Monday, despite the findings on the 2017 Tubbs Fire, a person familiar with the matter said.","In a brief statement, the California Department of Forestry and Fire said its investigators “did not identify any violations of state law, Public Resources Code, related to the cause of this fire.” It did not mention PG&E specifically.","The Tubbs Fire on Oct. 8, 2017 burned 36,807 acres (14,895 hectares) from Napa County to suburban Santa Rosa, in Sonoma County, killing 22 people and injuring one firefighter, according to CalFire. It was part of a conflagration of more than 170 fires that burned 245,000 acres (99,148 hectares), CalFire said.","PG&E is facing liabilities that could potentially exceed $30 billion because of the possibility that its equipment was involved in starting the devastating wildfires in the state in 2017 and 2018. The mounting liabilities have sent investors fleeing and prompted downgrades of its credit ratings, pushing it to the brink of bankruptcy.","Public outcry over PG&E’s spotty safety record has made lawmakers unwilling to back bailout legislation for the utility, which provides electricity and natural gas to 16 million customers in northern and central California.","California Governor Gavin Newsom told reporters outside his office in Sacramento that the Tubbs Fire liabilities accounted for about half of the $30 billion estimate and called the report a surprise. He added, however, that he did not know whether a reduction in liability would lead the company to pull back from a possible bankruptcy filing.","PG&E will continue to face lawsuits from fire victims and survivors who may not accept the premise of the CalFire report, Newsom said.","“This does not close out all of these lawsuits,” he said. While CalFire did not blame PG&E’s equipment for the Tubbs Fire, the company had been found responsible for 17 other blazes that year, he noted.","According to PG&E, the 2017 wildfires spurred lawsuits from some 3,800 individual plaintiffs. There are another 2,100 individual plaintiffs as a result of 2018 fires. If PG&E files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, wildfire cases would be put on hold, the company has said.","PG&E has stated repeatedly that it should not be held liable for the Tubbs Fire because it involved a private electrical facility. In November, Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note to clients that they were encouraged PG&E would not be held responsible for that fire.","Shares of PG&E rose nearly 75 percent to close at $13.95. After Reuters reported that the company still planned to file for Chapter 11, the shares fell 5.5 percent in extended trading.","PG&E shareholder BlueMountain Capital Management said in an emailed statement that the utility should not rush into a bankruptcy filing, which would be “totally unnecessary and bad for all stakeholders.”","But Moody’s Investors Service said bankruptcy was likely. “PG&E’s numerous regulatory, legislative, and credit challenges are largely unchanged and we still expect them to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the next few days,” Jeff Cassella, vice president and senior credit officer, at Moody’s said in a statement.","State Senator Bill Dodd, who helped pass a bill last year to allow utilities to raise rates to help cover 2017 fire costs, said he believed bankruptcy for PG&E was still a “done deal,” despite CalFire’s findings.","“I don’t think this changes their cash position going forward and doing what they have to do maintain a safe grid,” he said by phone."

This is the second time the hedge fund has run a proxy contest and it did not identify its intended nominees in the letter.","PG&E is reeling from potentially crushing liabilities associated with deadly wildfires in 2017 and 2018 that ripped through California communities, killing dozens of people and destroying homes.",The company forecasts its liabilities from the blazes could exceed $30 billion. The utility owner is facing scrutiny over the role of its equipment in the fires.,"With a new board and fresh oversight, the hedge fund forecast that the company’s share price could trade at $50 in the future. PG&E shares were down 1 percent at $7.91 in morning trading in New York on Thursday, giving the company a market capitalization of $4.2 billion.","“When sound governance is restored, and structural issues addressed, the company will resolve its financial issues,” the hedge fund wrote.","BlueMountain’s move, while a potential distraction for PG&E during its expected debt restructuring, would need additional support from other shareholders, like hedge funds Baupost Group, D.E.

The most recent blaze engulfed the California mountain community of Paradise, destroying homes and killing at least 86 people in the most destructive wildfire in state history.","Once PG&E files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, creditors can no longer call loans or demand interest payments, lawsuits are paused, and other claimants have to get in line and be subject to the reorganization plan that the company develops.","This could allow PG&E to settle disputes more effectively, and negotiate down its legal bill from the wildfires. PG&E is hoping it can exit bankruptcy in as little as two years, according to its advisers. It envisions no negative impact on its customers.","However, exiting bankruptcy could take longer if there are more wildfires while PG&E is in bankruptcy, a real threat given that climate change has turned the blazes into an annual occurrence.","A bankruptcy judge could even refuse to approve PG&E’s reorganization and exit from court proceedings if the judge finds that inverse condemnation calls into question its future as a viable company, according to U.S. law.","“Inverse condemnation is a state law but a bankruptcy judge is god,” said Robert McCullough, principal at energy consulting firm McCullough Research in Portland, Oregon, noting that PG&E faces widespread lawsuits. “He’s going to have to figure out, once he releases the company from bankruptcy, if it’s actually a viable entity.”","Private companies generally are not subject to this law, though it varies state by state, McCullough said. California’s laws are more extreme than most, he said.","In a regulatory filing on Monday, PG&E questioned whether it could continue to operate as a so-called investor-owned utility while being exposed to that risk. PG&E’s exposure to inverse condemnation represents a key issue the utility owner hopes to address should it seek bankruptcy protection, according to a person familiar with the matter.","PG&E challenged inverse condemnation in California’s Supreme Court unsuccessfully late last year. In a legal filing, the company noted that regulators decide how much private utilities such as PG&E can charge customers, limiting their ability to mitigate pain from crushing liabilities.",PG&E also highlighted in the legal argument a decision by regulators to deny another private utility’s request to recover hundreds of millions of dollars in uninsured costs resulting from settling claims related to wildfires.,"That status quo will cause private utilities to “face increasing difficulty in obtaining capital from investors, threatening financial harm to the utilities and potentially rendering them economically unsustainable,” the company said in the petition to California’s highest court.","Absent a court intervention, it would be up to California’s state politicians, including Governor Gavin Newsom, to come up with a legislative fix to inverse condemnation.","“Bankruptcy is PG&E’s response to the risk of (inverse condemnation),” said Severin Borenstein, the faculty director of the Energy Institute at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley.","“That leads to the larger question of whether or not this bankruptcy leads to...how we have utilities in California, and if we move from private firms to government owned,” he said.","PG&E’s subsidiary, Pacific Gas and Electric Company, filed for bankruptcy in 2001, offering hints on how much investors and creditors could recover this time. The subsidiary could not pay its bills during a California energy crisis caused by market manipulation that left consumers dealing with blackouts.","In PG&E’s 2001 bankruptcy, creditors were repaid in full, according to company statements, an unusual scenario most companies in financial distress do not achieve.","What is more, PG&E shares continued trading between 2001 and 2004, while the subsidiary was in bankruptcy, and never dropped below $6 per share, according to Refinitiv data. PG&E shares ended trading on Monday at $8.38. Most companies lose all equity value as they face bankruptcy.","PG&E’s bonds traded sharply lower Monday after the company said it was preparing for bankruptcy, indicating that holders do not expect to recover all of their investment this time."

PG&E is also a key player in helping California meet its ambitious climate goals.",Here are a few of the options California could consider to shore up the utility:,"California policymakers could extend assistance provided in a bill passed last year that allows utilities to raise rates to recover some of the costs related to wildfires. The law mitigates liability from fires in 2017 and others starting in 2019, but made no provision for fires last year.","The move would give PG&E an outlet for recovering billions of dollars in potential liabilities from last year’s fires, but might not be enough to assuage deep investor concerns about its long-term financial health given the increasing regularity of catastrophic fires. Insurance claims from the Camp Fire that erupted on Nov. 8 in PG&E’s service territory have topped $7 billion and are expected to grow.","“I don’t know that that would be enough to put the company in capital markets access, which is where they need to be,” said Michael Wara, a scholar focused on climate and energy policy at Stanford Law School.","It also may be a challenge politically, particularly since public and legislative sentiment has soured since the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) said last month it is considering penalties against PG&E for falsifying safety documents for natural gas pipelines.","“I am not interested in another piece of legislation that allows them to pass cost off to the ratepayers for these liabilities,” Assemblyman James Gallagher said in an interview on Saturday. “We need a much bigger shake-up and reform.”","Ratepayers are already bracing for higher rates due to the increased risks from wildfires. PG&E last month asked the CPUC for a $1.1 billion rate increase, more than half of which would be for wildfire prevention and risk reduction.","The CPUC could possibly interpret last year’s law to include 2018, or new legislation could be passed. A legislative solution would likely be faster.","Asked about PG&E’s fate at a news conference on Tuesday, California’s new governor, Gavin Newsom, said, “I’m not going to make news on that.” But he said he’d had a meeting on the subject at 8:00 a.m.","State lawmakers said they are leery of responding to PG&E’s bankruptcy threat too quickly, saying they have lost their trust in the company.","“I don’t know if I can trust this information,” State Sen. Bill Dodd said in an interview. “It’s really too bad that their credibility has been shattered so gravely. That just puts us and the legislature in a position where we are going to take the time that’s necessary to do this and to do it right.”","California could intervene directly by providing credit support for future debt financings or municipalizing all or some utility assets, Morgan Stanley analyst Stephen Byrd said.","If the utility became state-owned, California would assume all future wildfire risk, Byrd wrote in a client note last week. One scenario would be that the state takes over ownership of all of the electric distribution business and leaves the remaining businesses with shareholders. Byrd said this was the most bullish scenario for shareholders but added that it was unlikely that California would insulate shareholders from future wildfire liability while also giving them full value of the non-electric distribution businesses.","State ownership would not necessarily result in better maintenance of the utility’s distribution system, said Catherine Sandoval, a professor at Santa Clara Law School and former CPUC commissioner.","“If you change to municipal control without changing the underlying dynamics of the maintenance and operation of the utility and its transmission network, you haven’t really solved the problem,” Sandoval said.",State support for debt financing would result in a lower impact on consumer bills because all future wildfire liabilities would be absorbed by the remaining equity rate base in PG&E. This option would be less favorable for shareholders due to the threat of future fire liabilities.,"A perceived bailout of PG&E is losing luster among legislators and regulators and is far from assured, S&P Global said when it stripped the company of its investment-grade rating late on Monday.","“Previously, we assumed that given California’s robust renewable portfolio standards and the increasing risks of climate change, legislators and regulators would proactively work with the utility to preserve credit quality to achieve these goals,” S&P Global analysts said in a note. “However, based on recent developments, we no longer believe this to be true given the utility’s own missteps.”","The CPUC last month said it was considering a range of options for addressing PG&E’s safety problems, including replacing some or all of its directors, splitting the utility’s gas and electric divisions into separate companies, and reforming it into a publicly owned utility.","Since then, PG&E has said it is shaking up its board and reviewing its structure and corporate governance, but has not filed a specific plan with the CPUC.",The CPUC did not return a request for comment.,"California could allow PG&E to go bankrupt, for the second time in its history.","Under that scenario, shareholders would be the big losers. But California could benefit if the utility installs new management and can rebuild trust in Sacramento and on Wall Street. The state would also have time to consider how to reduce the risk from the cost of increasingly devastating wildfires over the long term.","“The fundamental problem is the utility at the current rate structure doesn’t generate enough revenue to cover expenses” from catastrophic wildfires, Stanford’s Wara said. “The utility’s management has gotten understandably very focused on the short term... The most important thing the state could do is slow things down. One way that happens is in bankruptcy.”","Though PG&E can continue to operate in bankruptcy, ratepayers could still see higher bills. When PG&E went bankrupt in 2001 amid the state’s energy crisis, California customers had to pay higher bills for years to help repay $13 billion owed to creditors. Another bankruptcy today could potentially lump individual claims from wildfires in with Wall Street’s claims, possibly ballooning the payout and leaving victims to compete with creditors.","Dodd, the state senator, said on Monday that he would ask the state’s Legislative Analyst’s Office to assess the impact of a PG&E bankruptcy on ratepayers and fire victims.","“I wouldn’t be surprised if a PG&E bankruptcy would lead to much higher rates for ratepayers and devastation for victims of previous wildfires,” Dodd said. “What we need to do is get some independent verification of what those numbers are and that will lead to a determination if legislation is necessary or not.”",PG&E spokesman Andy Castagnola said the utility would not comment.

In its filing, PG&E said it had $1.4 billion of insurance coverage.","It added, however, “if the utility’s equipment is determined to be the cause, the utility could be subject to significant liability in excess of insurance coverage that would be expected to have a material impact on PG&E Corporation’s and the utility’s financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.”","The fires could set off years of litigation to determine how much of the multi-billion insurance gap PG&E would have to fill. The company already faces dozens of lawsuits from owners of homes and other properties that burned during fires in 2017, according to court documents.","Insurers such as State Farm and USAA, which are on the hook for 2017 damage claims to policyholders, filed lawsuits against PG&E in San Francisco.","To keep PG&E from going bankrupt, California policymakers will face pressure to extend assistance provided in a bill approved last September allowing utilities to pass on to customers some of the costs related to wildfires, according to Moody’s. The bill mitigates liability from fires in 2017 and others starting in 2019, but made no provision for fires this year.","PG&E faces about $500 million of maturing floating rate notes later this month, but does not have another batch of principal repayments on its bonds until October 2020, when an $800 million bond comes due. That note, with a 3.5 percent coupon, has fallen by about 10 points since Tuesday afternoon to about 90 cents on the dollar, and its yield rocketed to nearly 9.5 percent from 3.6 percent just 24 hours earlier.","Its yield spread, a measure of additional compensation demanded by investors for holding it relative to safer bonds like U.S. Treasuries, mushroomed to 6.39 percentage points from 0.38 percentage point earlier in the week.","Longer-dated bonds got hit even harder, and all of the roughly $5 billion of PG&E debt due from 2040 and beyond is trading at steep discounts at between 70 and 80 cents on the dollar.","“We’re waiting to see,” said a PG&E bondholder, who asked to remain anonymous for compliance reasons. “Because it’s too hard to quantify the outcomes. You’ve seen some people run for the exit but there wasn’t a buyer, so you get the big trade down in price.”",The company also faces legal threats from fire victims.,"Three law firms representing multiple victims of California’s deadliest wildfire filed a lawsuit against PG&E Corp, alleging negligence and health and safety code violations by the utility.","Credit Suisse analysts estimated insured losses from the Camp, Woolsey and a smaller third fire, the Hill Fire, could range from $5 billion to $10 billion. Insurers incurred losses of around $15 billion from wildfires in the state in 2017, Credit Suisse said.","PG&E Corp’s PG&E utility, which provides power and gas to customers in California, has been in bankruptcy previously.","In 2001, during a California energy crisis when widespread market manipulation and a drought reduced the amount of electricity available for sale, PG&E sought bankruptcy protection because it paid an estimated $9 billion more to buy power for its customers than state regulators allowed the company to charge.","At that time, the state stepped in to buy power for PG&E and another cash-strapped power company, Southern California Edison (SCE), and eventually allowed the utilities to boost customer rates to cover some of their power purchase costs. SCE is a unit of California energy company Edison International."
