First Majestic has said it would appeal the decision.,"Officials last year also drew up criminal charges, in line with a recent reform that classifies tax fraud over 7.8 million pesos as a serious crime. According to an official document dated April 2020, reviewed by Reuters, prosecutors sought to recover from Primero Empresa Minera 426.3 million pesos ($20.71 million) in taxes owed in 2015 alone.","A judge in the northeastern state of Durango however declined to file charges last week, saying the tax authorities’ audit of the company was incomplete.
