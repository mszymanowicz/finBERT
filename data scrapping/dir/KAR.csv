The auto auction company had been taken private once before in 2007 in a $3.7 billion deal, and then went public in 2009.",There had been confusion recently over whether or not KAR’s salvage business would be spun out.,"“That led to the opportunity for us to buy a bunch of stock,” Smith said.",But KAR recently received a private letter ruling from the U.S. Internal Revenue Service deeming the spin-off as tax free and allowing the company to move forward with its plans.,Smith also discussed the firm’s position in healthcare information company Cerner Corp where the hedge fund reached a settlement and obtained board seats last week.,"Smith said that a refreshed board, commitments to buy back more shares and to reach for more aggressive targets will serve the company well. The company’s stock price rose 10 percent last week when the settlement was announced.","During the first quarter of 2019, Starboard was the most active activist investment firm, starting seven new campaigns that pushed for change at companies ranging from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co to pizza chain Papa Johns.","Starboard manages roughly $5 billion in assets, according to a regulatory filing made last month.","Starboard rose to prominence by throwing out the entire board at Darden Restaurants in 2014 and has won board seats this year at eBay, healthcare information company Cerner Corp. and Magellan Health."
