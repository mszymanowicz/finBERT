We’re trying to make sure that we can survive in Europe as a smaller, more profitable company.”","Sources previously told Reuters that Teklas put itself up for sale in a deal that could value the family-owned maker of rubber hoses and metal tubes for use in air conditioning, brakes and electric vehicles at as much as 700 million euros. ($779.17 million)","The sources identified Cooper-Standard as a suitor that was being targeted as a potential buyer of Teklas, which also supplies parts to Daimler, Fiat Chrysler, Toyota and Volkswagen.","Edwards said Cooper-Standard will be more opportunistic as it related to acquisitions, but prices have not been attractive in the last few years.","The main businesses for Cooper-Standard, with about $3.5 billion in annual sales, are sealing systems, fuel and brake delivery systems, and fluid transfer systems."
