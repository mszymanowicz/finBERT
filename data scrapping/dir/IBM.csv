Big Blue is rethinking its U.S. employee needs. More than half of its openings no longer require a bachelor’s degree, for example. It’s one way to meet the challenge of the post-coronavirus economy, in which employers can’t fill vacancies even as central bank boss Jerome Powell frets over lost jobs.","The pandemic has exacerbated inequalities that had begun to ease before the virus hit. The overall unemployment rate was 6.3% in January, compared to 3.5% a year ago. But for a person whose best qualification is a high school diploma, it was 7.1%, 3.4 percentage points higher than a year ago. The January jobless rate for people with at least a bachelor’s degree was just 4%. Noting these gaps, Powell on Wednesday called for a society-wide effort to reach full employment.","Meanwhile, some employers are hiring amid vaccinations and improved management of Covid-19. U.S. monthly job openings rose by 74,000 positions to nearly 6.7 million, the Labor Department said this week. But the National Federation of Independent Business found that one-third of small businesses could not fill vacancies, almost 30% of which were for skilled workers.","IBM is shedding its staid image to pitch innovative ideas to bridge that mismatch. Last month in a letter to nominees to lead the Labor and Education Departments, Obed Louissaint, a senior IBM executive, asked the government to expand eligibility for $130 billion in annual student aid.","About 65% of Americans who are at least 25 years old don’t have a college degree, shutting them out of such assistance. That’s why IBM wants student loans and so-called Pell grants available for part-time students, mid-career professionals, apprenticeships and certificate programs.",Another point of friction IBM points out is the difficulty of transferring academic credit to another institution. That particularly hurts students at community colleges who often intend to move to another school to earn a bachelor’s degree. Making that easier would help low-income students the most.,"Flooding the economy with cash, the main option open to the Fed and the one Congress has largely so far also taken, is one way to counteract the pandemic. IBM’s more nuanced suggestions could help make the economy more resilient next time."

He will replace current boss Virginia Rometty in April, the company announced on Thursday. Shareholders won’t miss her: At $121 billion, Big Blue’s market value has almost halved since she took the reins at the start of 2012. It now has a reputation as a former hardware provider that lost its way when the world moved on. Microsoft’s resurgence under boss Satya Nadella offers the best path ahead.","The two companies were both worth roughly $220 billion when Rometty took charge of IBM. One of her recent strategic moves even echoes those of former Microsoft boss Steve Ballmer. He paid way above the odds for a couple of companies in an attempt to leave behind the company’s stodgy image - before being effectively forced out in 2014. Rometty, meanwhile, splashed out too much in her $34 billion acquisition of Red Hat unveiled in 2018.","Nadella managed to get past Ballmer’s deals, despite adding a pricey-looking takeover of his own with LinkedIn, and has overseen a largely successful upgrade and expansion of its software while also growing its cloud-computing business, where revenue grew 62% in its most recent quarter. That makes it the main contender to industry leader Amazon. Over the past eight years the value of the company has increased six-fold to $1.3 trillion.","There’s plenty that could go wrong, of course. Krishna, who currently leads the cloud division, was instrumental in the Red Hat deal. That was designed to catapult IBM into the cloud business but has yet to show the purchase was worth the price paid. The fate of Finnish telecom company Nokia provides an instrumental lesson on how turnaround attempts can spiral down. It was once, like IBM, a dominant hardware maker before falling on hard times. It sold part of its business to Microsoft – one of Ballmer’s bad deals – and shares in the rest now trade at just 6% of their market high in 2000. Yahoo is another tale of woe. The Internet giant’s main business lost almost all of its value during a 10-year period before it was sold to Verizon.","Krishna has to push to be in Microsoft’s camp, but he’s got his work cut out for him."

That will put it in direct competition with firms like Microsoft, which has a similar mix of software and cloud services.","“We are going to both compete and partner with those other clouds,” Rometty said. “The thing about IBM is, we’ve been around long enough to know this is a multi-cloud world.”","Jim Whitehurst, the CEO of Red Hat, said the use of multiple clouds has been an advantage for Red Hat.","Cloud providers such as Amazon often offer a house-made version of the Linux operating system for free or at little cost.

It underscores IBM Chief Executive Ginni Rometty’s efforts to expand the company’s subscription-based software offerings, as it faces slowing software sales and waning demand for mainframe servers.","IBM, which has a market capitalization of $114 billion, will pay $190 per share in cash for Red Hat, a 63 percent premium to Friday’s closing share price.","Founded in 1993, Red Hat specializes in Linux operating systems, the most popular type of open-source software, which was developed as an alternative to proprietary software made by Microsoft Corp.","Headquartered in Raleigh, North Carolina, Red Hat charges fees to its corporate customers for custom features, maintenance and technical support, offering IBM a lucrative source of subscription revenue.","Red Hat is one of the very few companies in the cloud computing sector that has both revenue growth and free cash flow, Rometty, who has been IBM’s CEO since 2012, said in an interview with Reuters.","“This acquisition we are clearly doing for growth synergies. This is not about cost synergies at all,” Rometty said in the interview.","The acquisition illustrates how older technology companies are turning to dealmaking to gain scale and fend off competition, especially in cloud computing, where customers using enterprise software are seeking to save money by consolidating their vendor relationships.","IBM is hoping the deal will help it catch up with Amazon.com Inc, Alphabet Inc and Microsoft in the rapidly growing cloud business. IBM shares have lost almost a third of their value in the past five years, while Red Hat shares are up 170 percent over the same period.","“This deal represents the culmination of IBM’s existing partnership with Red Hat, and, in our view, allows IBM to gain a highly strategic asset to advance its hybrid cloud initiatives,” Barclays analysts wrote in a research note.","They added that for the deal to work, it was important for IBM to uphold Red Hat’s neutrality when it came to operating platforms and maintain Red Hat’s open-source and multi-cloud position in the market.","IBM was founded in 1911 and is known in the technology industry as Big Blue, a reference to its once ubiquitous blue computers. It has faced years of revenue declines, as it transitions its legacy computer maker business into new technology products and services. Its recent initiatives have included artificial intelligence and business lines around Watson, named after the supercomputer it developed.","To be sure, IBM is no stranger to acquisitions.

It also acquired Canadian business software maker Cognos in 2008 for $5 billion.",Other big technology companies have also recently sought to reinvent themselves through acquisitions. Microsoft this year acquired open source software platform GitHub for $7.5 billion; chip maker Broadcom Inc agreed to acquire software maker CA Inc for nearly $19 billion; and Adobe Inc agreed to acquire marketing software maker Marketo for $5 billion.,"One of IBM’s main competitors, Dell Technologies Inc, made a big bet on software and cloud computing two years ago, when it acquired data storage company EMC for $67 billion.
