As part of that agreement, Celgene shareholders received a so-called CVR, or contingent value right, worth $9 per share if three high-profile drugs in Celgene’s pipeline receive U.S. approvals by March 2021.","“We don’t see why we would not be on track for that,” Bristol-Myers CMO Samit Hirawat said in an interview when asked the prospects for achieving that goal.","The CVR BMY_r.N closed on Wednesday at $3.41 per unit, implying that investors currently give the company a roughly 40% chance of succeeding. That will depend on the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which must still review and approve all three drugs.",The first of the three medicines included in the CVR - Celgene’s multiple sclerosis drug ozanimod - is already being considered for approval by the FDA. A decision is expected by the end of this March.,Bristol-Myers said in December that the lymphoma treatment liso-cel had produced positive results in a clinical trial. It recently submitted an application seeking FDA approval and is awaiting feedback from the agency.,"The final asset included in the CVR is a CAR-T therapy for multiple myeloma known as bb2121, or ide-cel, that has produced promising results in trials.","“We continue to remain on track for filing of ide-cel and are looking forward to that approval based on the data, some of which has been shared,” said Hirawat, who joined Bristol-Myers in June.","Hirawat came to Bristol-Myers from Novartis, where he had run oncology development for the Swiss drugmaker. As chief medical officer, he oversees Bristol’s drug development programs.",Having such a large portfolio of established and experimental assets “opens up the door for opportunities of a proprietary combination” he said of multi-drug therapies that would be fully owned by the company.,"“One that easily comes to mind, for example, would be cell therapies along with a PD-1 inhibitor,” such as Bristol’s blockbuster cancer immunotherapy Opdivo, Hirawat said. That type of combination could be helpful for some patients whose lymphoma has stopped responding to other treatments, he suggested.","Hirawat said Bristol-Myers is currently developing its strategy for selecting which Celgene drugs it will test in new combination therapies, and could begin announcing those plans by the end of the year.","Once viewed as the company’s most important growth driver, Opdivo sales have flattened, hovering at around $1.8 billion a quarter for the past four quarters. The sales have faltered due to the dominance of Merck & Co’s rival immunotherapy Keytruda in newly-diagnosed advanced lung cancer, the most lucrative oncology market.","Opdivo sales are projected to dip in 2020, according to Refinitiv data. But the deal also brought in Celgene’s still growing cash cow Revlimid, which had sales of $2.77 billion in the third quarter.","In addition to Opdivo’s 19 current approvals, there are 20 more opportunities that the company is exploring, Hirawat said. That includes a combination with relatlimab, a new class of immunotherapy called a lag-3 inhibitor.","“That has the potential of bringing a new IO (immuno-oncology) therapy in the armamentarium of treatment of melanoma which currently doesn’t exist,” he said.",Bristol-Myers shares were up nearly 3% on Thursday at $65.69.

There are good reasons to buy rival oncology giant Celgene. But cost cuts don’t cover the 54 percent premium, and the target’s owners get the financial benefit. Bristol is hoping for luck in the courts and multiple regulatory approvals that Celgene’s shareholders were skeptical of.","The two cancer specialists fit well together, so it shouldn’t be too difficult to find a promised $2.5 billion in annual cost savings. Blood-cancer medicine Revlimid brought in about $10 billion in 2018 and has an extremely high margin. And the combination bolsters Bristol’s pipeline significantly, with the company projecting approvals for six new drugs soon.","Celgene has had a rough few years, though. Revlimid accounts for more than 60 percent of revenue. But generic rivals are challenging the patents protecting it and Celgene’s efforts to acquire replacements hit snags: One drug failed in late-stage trials, while regulators said an application to sell another was inadequate.","Sales of new medicine grew more slowly than expected. The shares fell by over half from their high in the summer of 2017, while the biotech index lost just 15 percent over the same period. At close of trading on Wednesday, Celgene shares were trading at just 6.4 times estimated consensus earnings for 2019, according to Refinitiv data, half of its new parent’s multiple.","However, Bristol is paying a premium of more than $25 billion. The current value of the cost cuts, once taxed and capitalized, is some 20 percent short of this, and some of this value will be captured by Celgene stock investors given the deal contains stock. That implies Celgene shareholders are accruing the obvious benefits.","Bristol’s shareholders aren’t impressed, eradicating almost $11 billion, or 13 percent, from its market value in midmorning trading.","Boss Giovanni Caforio has a reasonable shot at proving the skeptics wrong. At slightly less than 10 times earnings, it’s still paying a remarkably cheap price for control of a big pharma company. Celgene’s repeated missteps mean investors have largely given up hope that it will be able to defend Revlimid for an extended period and that new drugs will do well. Bristol’s purchase has the luxury of remarkably low investor expectations."

But the presentation did not include an update on lung cancer patients treated so far.,"Bristol and Nektar said they planned to move forward with late-stage studies of the combination for patients with melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and urothelial cancer.","“For now we are taking a more conservative view ... although we continue to see potential for long-term value creation with ‘214,” JP Morgan analyst Jessica Fye said in a research note on Sunday.","Fye lowered her 2018 price target for Nektar shares, which closed at $90.35 on Friday, to $78 from $90, citing a more conservative estimate for NKTR-214’s potential in lung cancer.","Evercore ISI analyst Umer Raffat said that even though trial response rates had dropped, he believed the collaboration made sense for Bristol-Myers."
