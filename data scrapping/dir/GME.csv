The struggling U.S. videogame retailer has been seeking a new leader to work on its e-commerce transition with chairman Ryan Cohen, the billionaire co-founder and former chief executive of online pet supplies retailer Chewy Inc (CHWY.N).","GameStop decoupled some of Sherman's pay from his performance last year in the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic and granted him stock when its shares were worth a tiny fraction of their current value, according to a Reuters review of security filings and interviews with compensation consultants.","As a condition of his exit, GameStop is speeding up the time frame for Sherman to receive the shares, generating the award.","Sherman, who has been CEO since April 2019, forfeited $98 million worth of stock this month because he did not meet performance targets, GameStop disclosed last week.","Still, he stands to receive a stock payout currently worth $179 million because GameStop granted him more shares linked to his tenure at the company rather than to his performance as most companies do with their CEO, said Eric Hoffmann, a vice president at compensation consultant Farient Advisors LLC.","""Investors like awards that are performance-based, that have hard pre-established financial goals that the executives have to meet to earn, as opposed to time-based shares, where they just have to hang on to get them,"" Hoffmann said.","A spokesman at Grapevine, Texas-based GameStop declined to comment. Sherman did not respond to requests for comment. Cohen, GameStop's largest shareholder with a 13% stake, could not be reached for comment.","The value of Sherman's severance payout surpasses annual salaries given to many top U.S. CEOs. ViacomCBS Inc (VIAC.O) CEO Joseph Ianniello took home $112.9 million in realized pay in 2019, while JPMorgan Chase & Co's (JPM.N) Jamie Dimon's 2019 realized pay hit $107.8 million, according to the most recent tally by corporate governance data provider CGLytics.","Other GameStop employees will not share in Sherman's windfall. The retailer has been shuttering hundreds of stores, according to securities disclosures.","GameStop's shares closed at $158.53 on Tuesday, a stratospheric rise from around $5 last summer, when the company granted the bulk of the stock award to Sherman. They skyrocketed in January as individual traders on Reddit and other social media platforms snapped them up, squeezing short sellers.","Reuters reported last year how some companies were shielding executives from the financial fallout of the pandemic by moving from performance-based to time-based payouts. They reasoned that the market disruption made it difficult to meet financial targets, and Sherman will benefit from that trend.","Sherman, 59, has been credited internally with slashing costs and steering GameStop through the pandemic that put other retailers out of business, Reuters reported last week.","But his 25 years of experience have been largely with brick-and-mortar retailers, such as Advance Auto Parts Inc (AAP.N) and Home Depot Inc (HD.N). Cohen wants a top executive with skills better suited for GameStop's digital transformation, Reuters reported.",VESTING OF SHARES,"GameStop granted Sherman roughly 925,000 shares last June that he was set to receive in thirds over three years, according to regulatory filings.","He is set to receive them all at once upon his exit under terms of a ""transition agreement"" negotiated this month, as well as roughly 200,000 more shares that had not previously vested, the filings show. The filings do not disclose how GameStop's board decided on these awards.","Sherman also stood to eventually receive 308,477 shares awarded last June that were tied to his performance, separate from the stock he forfeited last week.

After a wild ride, he is now up more than 200% and expects the video game retailer to initiate a much-awaited turnaround of its business.","“I am kicking myself for not buying more when it dropped below $50,” said Youngblood. “After research I believe GameStop has a good chance to pull it off.”","The latest resurgence in GameStop shares has reinvigorated true believers. Still, many analysts point to the rally in beaten-down “meme stocks” championed in forums such as Reddit’s WallStreetBets as evidence for speculative excess in stimulus-fueled markets.","“I think this is a cult stock,” said Michael Pachter, managing director of equity research at Wedbush Securities. “The rally is because of demand from the Reddit Raiders, and it’s not clear it will be sustainable as the stock rises to ever higher levels.”","GameStop shares closed on Wednesday up 7% at $265 after hitting a session peak of $348.50, which was 800% above last month’s low. Among the factors driving the stock are bets on improving fundamentals and hopes for another short squeeze like the one in late January, which drove prices as high as $483. Many GameStop investors also hope Americans will plow money from their coming stimulus checks into the stock.","Some expect GameStop to take advantage of the new rally by launching a share offering to pay down debt. Its earnings report, scheduled for March 23, could clear the way.",GameStop did not reply to a request for comment on its stock price.,Analysts who cover GameStop have a median price target of $12.50 on the stock.

Many cheered moves to tap Ryan Cohen, a shareholder and co-founder of online pet products retailer Chewy Inc , to spearhead a committee guiding GameStop’s transition to e-commerce.","Hopeful investors have interpreted Cohen’s cryptic tweets, including a picture of an ice cream cone, as signs he is pushing the retail chain away from its brick-and-mortar model. Still, Pachter said even the most successful transition would not justify such a stratospheric stock price.","For the quarter ended Oct. 31, GameStop reported here a net loss of $18.8 million and a loss per share of 29 cents. To justify a trading price of $235, it would need to earn between $10 and $12 a share annually on a sustainable basis, Pachter said. He expects the company to earn $1 a share for the fiscal year ending in January 2022.","“We don’t know what Ryan Cohen proposes to change, but those numbers sound unattainable in the short term,” he said.",Other analysts were slightly more optimistic.,"“Before, when the stock rallied there was really no legitimate, fundamental reason,” said David Keller, chief market strategist at Stockcharts.com, a technical analysis and charting platform targeted at retail investors. “Now all of a sudden this feels more like a growth stock.”","Some GameStop bulls believe improving fundamentals and a climbing stock price will put bearish investors into another “short squeeze,” forcing them to unwind bets against the company. When this happened in January, GameStop surged by 1,600%. It pared most of those gains in February.",Analysts said a short squeeze is likely accelerating the latest rally.

But, he added, “historically you would say that is one of the riskier parts of the market and the fact that it has moved so aggressively ... is emblematic of high risk appetite.”","More than 80% of the components of the iShares Micro-Cap ETF had posted gains in 2021 as of Tuesday, against over 60% of those in the SPDR S&P 500 ETF, according to Refintiv data.","Among stocks on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq, those that started the year with market values of less than $500 million were up an average 34%, triple the gain of those above $500 million, according to Refinitiv data.","Big micro-cap gains this year include a 177% rise for shares of Esports Entertainment Group and a 178% surge for Energous Corp, a wireless charging company.","“The speculative fever is out there,” said Eric Kuby, chief investment officer at North Star Investment Management, which has run a micro-cap fund for over 20 years. As long as that persists, he said, “it’s good for this class of stocks that are speculative in their nature.”","Since Pfizer’s breakthrough COVID-19 vaccine news in early November, the Russell Microcap index has soared 54% against a nearly 12% rise for the S&P 500.","Until then, the micro-cap index had fallen 2% in 2020 against the S&P 500’s nearly 9% rise, after lagging the S&P in the prior three years.","“You are coming out of this incredibly long period of historic underperformance going into the pandemic,” Kuby said. “One could argue after that period of underperformance, a lot of them had gotten very inexpensive.”","Small-cap funds, which include micro caps, have seen nearly $23 billion in net inflows starting in November after six months of outflows, according to Lipper data.","“They are cheap stocks, they are getting fund flows, they fit some of the themes that I think people are interested in,” said Steven DeSanctis, equity strategist at Jefferies.","Investors noted that money flowing to micro-cap stocks can create outsized moves because they have relatively few shares available to be traded. Micro-cap stocks have an average free float of about 29 million shares compared with an average of about 600 million shares for S&P 500 stocks, according to Refinitiv data.","“Micro caps are particularly unpredictable,” said Joel Schneider, deputy head of portfolio management at Dimensional, “but they do go through periods of very strong performance.”"

The Federal Reserve will buy whatever Treasury debt is appropriate for the central bank’s monetary policy goals, she added.","Asked if she wanted to regulate cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, Yellen called it “a high-risk, speculative investment” that has seen a recent surge in value. The top priority was to ensure that bitcoin is not used as a vehicle for illicit transactions and that investor protections are maintained, she said.","Ensuring that firms dealing in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies “adhere to their regulatory responsibilities I think is certainly important,” Yellen added."

Here is who is probing the saga:",The House Financial Services Committee on Thursday will grill executives involved in the saga.,"Lawmakers have questioned whether the retail trading platforms, by curbing buying in the affected securities, sided with powerful hedge funds over Mom and Pop investors.","On Thursday, they will likely focus on commercial arrangements between trading platforms and market makers they route orders to and whether that “payment for order flow” model may disadvantage retail investors. There are also questions about whether hedge funds that bet against the shares pressured trading platforms to suspend buying and whether Reddit or its users breached the letter or spirit of the law by hyping shares.","Market makers and retail brokers say “payment for order flow” often results in better prices for retail investors than if their orders were sent to the stock exchange. Lawyers say retail trading platforms’ user agreements typically allow them to curb buying, while social media platforms like Reddit are shielded from liability for users’ activity under a 1996 law.","Representative Maxine Waters, the committee chair, has power to subpoena the companies if she is not satisfied on Thursday.","The SEC is looking at every aspect of and parties involved in the episode, suggesting a swath of industry players may be swept up in its review of the trading frenzy.","The potential misconduct the SEC is probing, according to its acting chair Allison Lee, includes: market manipulation; whether retail brokers breached fair access rules by restricting buying; the role of hedge funds with short positions in the companies, including whether there was enough data and transparency around their bets; and whether the companies took advantage of the rally to raise funds.","The agency may also examine whether hedge funds broke risk management rules that aim to ensure investors can make good on their short bets, said lawyers. Consumer advocates expect the SEC will also examine “payment for order flow” arrangements.","The Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin has expressed concern about market integrity and systemic risks. This month, he subpoenaed Keith Gill, a YouTube streamer known as Roaring Kitty who helped drive the surge of GameStop shares.","Last month, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton began probing retail trading firms, alleging “apparent coordination between hedge funds, trading platforms, and [social media platforms] to shut down threats to their market dominance.”",New York Attorney General Letitia James is also reviewing the episode.,The Wall Street Journal reported last week that the Justice Department and the San Francisco U.S. attorney’s office have sought information from brokers and social-media companies.,"Prosecutors are probing whether market manipulation or other types of criminal misconduct fueled the rally, the WSJ said.",It also reported that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) was probing an apparent Reddit rally in silver futures and an exchange-traded fund tied to the metal.,Spokespeople for the Justice Department and CFTC declined to comment on the WSJ report.

""You end up with this situation that could destabilize the financial markets.""","Typically, shorting a stock is a bet that the share price is going to fall.","Short sellers borrow shares from brokers and then sell them into the market, with the agreement that they will buy the shares back and return them to the lender at an agreed upon time. The shares can come from the brokers’ own inventories, or from customers that have allowed the brokers to lend out their shares.","When it’s time to return the shares, if the stock price has fallen, the short seller can buy the shares back at a lower price than they originally paid for them, locking in a profit.","If the price has risen, the short seller must buy back the shares at the higher price, incurring a loss.","In the meantime, the short seller pays the lender interest on the value of the stock, giving the lender extra income.","Not really. The borrower posts collateral, typically here 102% of the prior day's settlement price. The borrower can also request the shares back at any time.","Once the short seller borrows the shares from the lender and then sells them back into the market, the new owner of the shares is free to lend them out, just as the previous owner did, and have no idea they are on the other side of a short sale.","Settlement time is two days after the transaction. In that time, the same shares can be lent out again, and again. This makes it possible, on paper, for more than 100% of the float of a stock to be shorted.","According to financial analytics firm S3, GameStop’s peak short interest was 141.8% of its float on Jan. 4.","S3 argued in a recent research note that the traditional method of calculating the percentage of float is flawed because it uses stale data. U.S. investors are required to mark their shares shorted and regulators report these figures twice a month, with a 10-day delay, S3 said.",There have been calls since the GameStop saga to improve transparency around short selling through more frequent reporting.,"When the price of a heavily shorted stock soars, short-sellers are forced to buy the shares back at a higher prices to close out their positions, pushing the stock price even higher.","Shorting shares in GameStop cost hedge funds a total $12.5 billion over January, according to financial analytics firm Ortex.","Yes.

So are Keith Gill, who helped fuel the surge in GameStop with Reddit posts using the tag Roaring Kitty, and Reddit chief executive Steve Huffman.",The issues to be discussed are detailed in a memo here.,"Founder and CEO Ken Griffin here, 52, built both the Citadel LLC hedge fund and market making business Citadel Securities by investing in technology, data and traders. The businesses operate separately from each other.","During the financial crisis Citadel’s hedge fund stumbled badly to end 2008 with a 55% loss. The hypercompetitive Griffin rebounded, and in 2009 the flagship hedge fund gained 62%. Over its three decades the hedge fund has returned an average 19% a year.","In January, Citadel’s hedge fund and securities trading businesses became central figures in the GameStop story for two reasons: Its order flow from Robinhood, the app many retail traders used to buy GameStop, and its role bailing out Melvin Capital after Melvin’s short position on GameStop soured.","Citadel Securities, led by Peng Zhao, competes with other market makers for Robinhood’s order flow and receives a large percentage of orders based on execution quality. It also pays Robinhood to process orders it receives.","Griffin threw Melvin a $2 billion financial lifeline when it stumbled, saying he has “great confidence” in the team. In return he will get exposure to the fund’s future returns in addition to a share of the revenue for years.","The move was reminiscent of other times Griffin took advantage of trouble. In 2006, he bought an ailing energy portfolio from Amaranth Advisors and in 2007 he snapped up Sowood Capital’s credit portfolio.","Chief Executive Officer Vlad Tenev, 34, co-founded online broker Robinhood Markets Inc in 2013 with the goal of “democratizing finance for all,” by offering commission-free trading.","Tenev was born in Bulgaria, grew up in the Washington, D.C. area, and earned a math degree at Stanford University in California. He dropped out of a PhD program at UCLA to join his Stanford roommate Baiju Bhatt in business ventures. The pair started two New York-based trading software companies before founding Robinhood back in California. Lockdowns during the coronavirus pandemic turbo-charged Robinhood’s growth, especially among younger investors. The company boasts more than 13 million users and is valued at more than $20 billion, Reuters reported in December, with an IPO expected this year.","Lawmakers are likely to question Tenev about the trading app’s decision to restrict trading during the GameStop frenzy, and Robinhood’s role in the “gamification” of stock trading, which may promote risky trading among retail investors and has attracted scrutiny in Washington.","Tenev has faced heavy criticism from some Robinhood customers and has even been the target of death threats, according to Bloomberg. Robinhood declined to comment.","Gabriel Plotkin, one of the world’s most successful hedge fund investors, stated his aim succinctly in August on a YouTube video: “Just get better every day.” He stuck to that motto for years, with 30% average annual returns from 2014 to 2020 at Melvin Capital, the fund named after his grandfather, a small businessman.",Plotkin honed his craft at SAC Capital Advisors. He left when SAC pleaded guilty to insider trading charges but did not cut ties with founder Steven A. Cohen who was among his first investors and had $1 billion invested in Melvin last year.,"Over time, Plotkin developed expensive tastes, say people who know him. Last year he paid $44 million for side-by-side properties overlooking Miami’s Biscayne Bay and in 2019 he bought a minority stake in the Charlotte Hornets basketball team.","In January, the hedge fund lost 53% and its size shriveled from $12.5 billion to $8 billion largely because of a bet that GameStop’s stock would fall. GameStop rose instead thanks to the Reddit rally.","Plotkin’s short position in GameStop enraged some people so much that he received death threats. After GameStop’s Reddit rally swamped Melvin with red ink, stunned investors, regulators and lawmakers want answers to Plotkin’s risk management and how he had left his fund so vulnerable."

But it is another sign of the voracious appetite for risk that has gripped markets in the wake of unprecedented stimulus from the Federal Reserve, expectations of another fiscal package from lawmakers and a rally that has boosted the S&P 500 Index about 80% from its March lows.","In recent weeks, investors looking to capitalize on the sharp rise in the PHLX Semiconductor index have poured money into the Direxion Daily Semiconductor Bull 3X Shares, which seeks to amplify daily moves in the chip index threefold.","The fund is up about 1,000% over the last 11 months compared with a rally of about 150% in the chip index. It has logged inflows for five straight weeks, the longest such stretch since April, helping boost its assets to a record $3.27 billion.","Meanwhile, assets in the ProShares Ultra VIX Short Term Futures ETF, which provides leveraged exposure to short-term volatility futures, hit a record $2.5 billion on Friday, up about 50% since Feb. 3.","Another leveraged ETF, the ProShares UltraPro QQQ which targets 3X the one-day return on the Nasdaq 100 Index, has nearly doubled its assets over the last 9 months to $11.13 billion, according to data from ProShares.","The inflows to these funds come amid signs that investors are becoming increasingly willing to take risks, less than a year since a COVID-19 driven sell-off lopped about a third off the S&P 500 Index.","Although these ETPs are leveraged, investors risk only the amount they invested, unless they bought on margin. Still, when the market moves against some of these trades, the losses can be quick and staggering.The latest fund manager survey by BofA Global Research showed cash allocations down to their lowest level since March 2013, allocations to stocks and commodities at their highest level in around a decade and a record in the net percentage of investors taking higher-than-normal risk.","“Investors are seeing volatility and looking to participate from a short-term perspective,” said Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA, referring to flows into leveraged and inverse ETPs.","ETPs track an underlying security, index, or financial instrument and trade on exchanges like stocks. Exchange traded funds, which contain investments that can include stocks and bonds, are the most popular type of ETPs.","Analysts caution that leveraged and inverse ETPs, many of which are extremely volatile, are designed to be used as quick in-and-out trading vehicles, not as buy-and-hold securities.","Long-term holding of some of these ETPs can rack up significant losses. For instance, UVXY, which appreciates sharply when stocks turn volatile, tends to fall steadily in value when markets remain calm.","Leveraged and inverse ETFs accounted for more than 20% of the ETF closures in 2020, FactSet data showed, when many struggled to deal with intensely volatile markets.","The Securities and Exchange Commission in October put off proposals for controls on the sale of leveraged exchange traded funds to retail investors, saying it would study the issue later.","“I thought maybe, when I saw some of these close at the end of last year, the industry might be taking a different look toward these products,” said Lois Gregson, senior ETF Analyst at FactSet. “But we have seen different ones open up.”"

Far more likely is that GameStop will benefit from faster e-commerce growth while closing stores at a delayed pace with a slower rollout of new services, leaving its shares worth $13 each, he said.","A “storm cloud” scenario, meanwhile, in which customers abandon the store and push the company’s share price to zero, is three times more likely to happen than a successful transition to a digital marketplace, Sebastian said.","The company's current average target price among analysts is nearly double that of November, shortly before Ryan Cohen, one of the company's largest shareholders, urged it in a Nov. 16 letter here to focus on digital sales.","Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, currently has a $16 per share price target for the company but said that “you could convince me that it’s worth $24” per share depending on its ability to transition to a digital-first business.","Yet the stock’s price has become disconnected from its intrinsic value, leaving it inevitable that it will collapse, he said.","“They are a real company with real profits and the management team is good,” Pachter said. “I was telling the shorts when it was at $8 that it’s not going to zero.”"

Hertz declined to comment.,"Over the past few weeks, soaring stock prices of GameStop - along with movie theater chain AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc, home goods retailer Bed, Bath & Beyond Inc and other companies - on the back of Reddit memes and YouTube videos have put company leaders in a similar situation.","The internal Hertz deliberations offer a window into the contours of the ethical and regulatory dilemmas they face. Namely, can they sell stock to raise capital in such a volatile market?","Regulators are watching. The acting head of the SEC has said in recent days that the agency is looking closely at how companies are behaving, including whether they are trying to raise money and adequately disclosing risks associated with it to investors.","“Taking advantage of what could potentially be a manipulated market would trigger both reputational and legal concerns,” said Donald Langevoort, a Georgetown University Law Center professor and former SEC attorney.",The SEC declined to comment.,"As a social-media-fueled retail trading frenzy has whipsawed a series of “stonks” - a Reddit meme for stocks - over the past few weeks, the companies in the eye of the storm have largely kept quiet. But three sources familiar with some of these companies said discussions about surging shares are taking place in their C-suites and boardrooms as well.","Unlike Hertz, these companies are not under bankruptcy protection. So far, they are taking different approaches.","GameStop, whose shares slumped as much as 84% in the first week of February after surging more than 25-fold the previous month, has paperwork lined up to sell $100 million worth of new equity but has not yet disclosed whether it has done so. American Airlines Group Inc pulled the trigger on a plan to sell more than $1 billion of stock after its shares recently rallied as much as 48%.",GameStop and American declined to comment.,"AMC, which previously warned it could file for bankruptcy after the pandemic temporarily closed its cinemas, has raised roughly $1.2 billion through debt and equity deals. It is now racing to file papers with regulators to sell shares possibly worth hundreds of millions of dollars more, two people familiar with the matter said.","“A company would be silly not to” consider selling additional shares, one source close to AMC said. “Any company that is thinking seriously would want to talk it through and decide what strategies are available.”","AMC did not respond to a request for comment. In late January, Chief Executive Adam Aron said recent fundraising meant “any talk of an imminent bankruptcy for AMC is completely off the table.”","That was the dilemma Hertz faced last spring. The company filed for bankruptcy last May, crumbling under roughly $19 billion of debt as the pandemic decimated its business.","Roughly two weeks later, Hertz shares vaulted nearly 16 times to a high of $6.25, almost unheard of at the time for any company, let alone one under bankruptcy protection. Directors, executives and company advisers were befuddled, three sources familiar with the matter said. Calling around, there were no signs that a hedge fund or other large institutional investor was buying shares, one of the sources said.","An adviser talked with an investor who suggested the trading app Robinhood was behind the unexpected rise, the source said. Indeed, Hertz was among the platform’s most popular stocks. “Hertz bankruptcy is CANCELLED by Robinhood ‘investors,’” a Reddit commenter called “itsnotshade” wrote at the time. “Good job guys.”","Some Hertz directors saw an opportunity to bolster its cash coffers with a stock sale. But some in the management, along with other directors, pushed back over concerns the shares were virtually worthless and any offering would take advantage of small-time investors unfamiliar with bankruptcy law, the sources familiar with the discussions at the time said.","Directors favoring a share sale countered that, while rare, shareholders sometimes receive payouts in bankruptcy cases, one of the sources said. Shares of other companies under bankruptcy protection, such as J.C. Penney Co Inc and Whiting Petroleum Corp, were also spiking at the time.","Eventually, the board decided to proceed with selling shares. On June 12, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Mary Walrath approved Hertz’s plan to sell new shares. In court filings, Hertz touted that it would not have to repay the money and that the move was better for its creditors.",Hertz alerted the SEC and warned prospective buyers they would likely lose all their money.,"But the deal was done before it started. In a television interview, then-SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said the agency had informed Hertz it had “comments” on the stock offering, and that most companies do not go forward after hearing from the regulator until the issues are resolved. Reuters could not determine the content of the SEC’s feedback on the offering.","The next day, Hertz, not wanting to antagonize regulators, pulled the offering, two of the sources said."

Shares of cinema operator AMC Entertainment have more than halved from a closing peak of $19.90 and closed down 3.67% on Friday.",(Graphic: Wild ride for Gamestop and AMC: ),"Shares of insurer Clover Health, which on Thursday became the first company to be targeted by a short-selling report in weeks, rose 5.7% due to a late rally sparked by comments from venture capitalist backer Chamath Palihapitiya in response. The company earlier said on Friday it had received a letter from the Securities and Exchange Commission following the report published by Hindenburg Research.","Meanwhile, on WallStreetBets, participants were still urging investors to stick with GameStop.","“GME YOLO/FOMO my second mortgage. 35k to 5mil to 300k.

There was a small-scale online crusade to support Malaysia’s heavily shorted glove makers, and calls in South Korea to retain a ban on short-selling.","But such retail cheerleaders have struggled to attract much of a following. China’s stock market once had the reputation of being a casino, yet the country’s stringent censorship, absence of famous short-sellers and a general tendency to not cross state directives stymie their efforts.","Dean Li, a blogger on Xueqiu.com, a Reddit-like investor community, said the GameStop saga had demonstrated that “if a short-seller dares to rashly announce bearish bets against a listed company, it will be in trouble.” But both short-selling and option trading, the key drivers of GameStop’s stratospheric rise, are restricted in China, making such a duel impossible, he said.","Huang Wei, founder of an online investment community that comprises what he calls “grassroots investors”, said he emphasizes with U.S. retail investors in their “riot” against Wall Street short-sellers, but in China, there’s no grounds for a retail investor uprising.","“It’s a clash of people’s value outlook. It’s like farmers uprising against tyranny,” Huang said.","“There isn’t widespread public discontent at the moment.... so you don’t see Che Guevara or Mao Zedong in the market,” Huang said, referring to the charismatic leaders in Cuban and Chinese revolutions.",The chance of a Chinese equivalent to GameStop emerging has been dimmed further by recent capital market reforms aimed at weeding out weak companies and encouraging long-term investment. Chinese regulators are also cracking down on price manipulation and Internet stock recommendations.,"The China Securities Regulatory Commission campaign last September scrutinized illegitimate stock recommendations, also taking aim at “market black mouths” who spread misleading information to influence stock prices, as well as “black apps”, which attract investor clients using chat groups on social media.","Chinese hedge fund manager Yuan Yuwei said the trading patterns seen in GameStop are not new in China, or Hong Kong, where speculators have talked up stocks in pump-and-dump schemes.","“The pattern is identical. You drive up share prices and attract followers. And then, you dump your holdings to late comers. The only difference is that you have no or little short positions (in China),” he said, adding such practices have become much less common in China in recent years.","Still, Nirgunan Tiruchelvam, head of consumer equity research at Tellimer, said he expected the retail frenzy to flare up soon in Asia, including China.","“That could be a perfect storm where you have the use of these Robinhood-type platforms, plus, the spread of internet chat groups, plus, the highly shorted names. That would create a potent cocktail,” said Tiruchelvam, who identified stocks including China Literature and MTR Corp as potential targets. “This is actually the beginning of a massive wave of investing behavior along these lines.”"

The so-called “Reddit rally” to squeeze shortsellers rocketed GameStop Corp shares from below $18 a share in early January to as high as $483 last week. Diaz sold some to take profits of $1,500 and hold on to the rest, 10 shares.","After watching the shares plunge on Thursday to close at $53.5, Diaz said he plans to buy more if the price keeps dropping.","“At first it was investing in an idea,” said Diaz. “But then after all the shenanigans when retail investors who wanted to purchase were prevented from doing it, it got personal. So I’m just going to hold until it plays out.”","The wild swings of GameStop and other Reddit rally favorites were cast as a David versus Goliath tale of individuals taking on Wall Street hedge funds. With trading volume swelling last week, online broker Robinhood and other investing apps placed restrictions on GameStop and other shares.","The fierce rally damaged some hedge funds when they could not cover short positions. Still, many people on Wall Street have also made money off GameStop, while some small investors were hurt by its rapid decline.","Many financial professionals had warned the rally could not last forever. Still, lawyers said their phones have been ringing with GameStop shareholders hoping to recoup losses. Even during this week’s swoon, many recent Reddit posts pledged to hold GameStop until the stock goes “to the moon.”","“IF HE’S STILL IN, I’M STILL IN”","Those who were late to the party are likely looking at losses, if they did not hedge their long positions somehow.","John Gjolaj, a restaurant manager in New York and longtime user of Reddit’s WallStreetBets forum, invested in over 300 shares of GameStop last week at $269 a share. He plans to hold on. Gjolaj said he believed GameStop’s team can turn around the company.","“I’m hoping I can sell it at $500 or so. But if it takes years, I’ll be holding,” Gjolaj said. “I invested in bitcoin at its height in 2017. I can stomach all this volatility.”","Jerry Corley, a gardener in Arkansas, joined WallStreetBets’ thread on Reddit last week and bought three shares of GameStop on Monday. Looking at a loss, he has drawn encouragement from Roaring Kitty, the online handle of an investor who championed GameStop and whose posts claimed he turned an investment of a few thousand dollars into millions.","“He has got his money where his mouth is. This guy’s no dummy. That’s a great sign right there,” said Corley.","On Wednesday, Roaring Kitty, also known as DeepF***ingValue on WallStreetBets, posted a screenshot on Twitter of the GameStop stock, which was traded at around $4 in July, adding “I like the stock.”","Keith Patrick Gill, a trained financial advisor who is behind the Roaring Kitty streams, did not respond to a request for comment. His recent posts show he still holds a position worth over $8 million in the stock.","Some followers on Reddit posted after his Wednesday tweet: “If he’s still in, I’m still in.”","Diaz tried to get around Robinhood’s trading restrictions by using several trading platforms. But the trading limits quickly drew a backlash from investors and U.S. lawmakers from both parties, and have also sparked lawsuits.",Levin Papantonio Rafferty attorney Michael Bixby said his firm has gotten dozens of calls with “every sort of complaint you could imagine” related to Robinhood’s handling of GameStop trading.,"“If you lost $10,000, that might be a heck of a lot of money to the individual but it would be difficult to justify the cost of litigation,” Bixby said.","A representative for Robinhood declined comment on the lawsuits. Previously, the online broker said the trading restrictions were put in place to because of the collateral it needs to post required by clearinghouses to backstop many of the trades.","Matthew Schwartz, attorney at Kass Shuler in Florida, said most of the calls he received were from individuals trading options that could not buy, or who had traditional equities that were restricted.","The Reddit rally also had winners that remain in play. Bryan Towey, a 20-year-old entrepreneur in New York, said he made over 890% returns on GameStop since he invested in 10,000 shares at an average cost of $22.10 per share in early January after reading about the company’s e-commerce sales growth.","Towey has gradually sold his holdings since it hit $165, but still owns 2,200 shares, in the hope for another breakout.","“I’m like a gut investor type of person,” Towey said. “I have a good feeling about the business. If there is another bubble, I’ll probably get rid of it.”"

The Reddit effect then appeared to spread into the silver market last week.","Several U.S. lawmakers expressed outrage at trading limits on individual investors, and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen convened a meeting of market regulators.","On Monday, acting SEC chair Allison Herren Lee told National Public Radio the agency was examining the conduct of retail brokers, potential market manipulation, the role of hedge funds that bet against the companies, and whether the companies tried to exploit the rally by raising money.","In recent days, questions have grown around the arrangements retail brokers have with market making firms to which they route orders; the role of the clearing houses; and whether some hedge funds jumped on the Reddit bandwagon and bought up GameStop to amplify their rivals’ pain.","GameStop and other Reddit rally stocks have since dropped sharply, with GameStop down 38% on Thursday.","Proving manipulation may be tough due to ambiguous U.S. securities laws, said Joseph Grundfest, a professor at Stanford Law and a former SEC commissioner.","“The law governing market manipulation is almost as chaotic as the trading in GameStop shares,” he said.","Still, the episode is not entirely novel territory. In 2000, the SEC charged individuals in two separate “pump-and-dump” schemes that used internet message boards to drive up stocks. In December, it sued a former day trader who profited from spreading false rumors about public companies in online forums.","The SEC would look beyond generalized hype for users who disseminated false or misleading information about material company issues, such as revenues and products, or coordinated efforts to force buying or selling, said lawyers.","“I think the existing SEC playbook still functions fairly well,” said Philip Moustakis, counsel at Seward & Kissel and a former SEC senior enforcement counsel. If the trading was driven by a decentralized crowd with no organizers, that could pose challenges, he continued. “They might have to rely on a more novel theory of market manipulation.”","The SEC will likely also probe whether hedge funds properly disclosed risky bets to clients and allowed some clients to cash out before others, said Ken C. Joseph, a managing director at Duff & Phelps LLC and former SEC official.","Broker trading restrictions will also raise questions over fair access to markets, said Robert Frenchman, an attorney with Mukasey Frenchman & Sklaroff.","“Fair access to markets has long been a regulatory priority,” he added.",Robinhood has said its decision to suspend trading in some shares was purely a risk management decision and that it is committed to its customers.

Those at risk could include people who bought the stock at recent highs, or on margin, and those using options trading strategies.","Shares of GameStop, which had seen a spectacular rally, fell 31% on Monday to close at $225, 53% lower than their Jan 28 peak of $483.",Analysts worry some new or inexperienced investors could face losses if they bought in as the stock was peaking.,"Particularly vulnerable would be those who bought “on margin,” using money borrowed from brokers to buy extra shares.","The strategy can boost gains when share prices are on the way up, but magnify losses on the way down especially if brokers issue “margin calls” requiring clients to add money or face forced sales to bring an account’s equity back to required levels.","Brokers are not required to notify clients when they sell shares in a margin call, ""although most do so as a courtesy,"" according to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority here, the industry's self-policing body.","Riley Adams, a 31-year-old financial analyst who runs youngandtheinvested.com, a financial blog aimed at millennials, said if investors bought on margin late to the party “you’re definitely exposed right now.”","Thomas Peterffy, chairman of Interactive Brokers, estimated about half the platform’s 1.2 million accounts are margin accounts. Thousands of margin calls occur on a typical day and the rate increased last week, he said. Peterffy said about 27,000 accounts had some sort of position in GameStock, and many positions liquidated were owned by traders who had shorted GameStock.",Representatives for brokerages TD Ameritrade and Robinhood declined to share details about how many clients may have traded GameStop shares on margin. A Schwab representative did not respond to questions.,"However, Robinhood has restricted here buying shares, which limits investor exposure on its platform.",Options bets on GameStop shares helped fuel the stock’s breathtaking rally. Investors are gauging to what extent they could exacerbate a decline.,Some market watchers say a “gamma squeeze” - where market makers who have sold large numbers of calls to investors balance out their positions by buying the underlying stock - was a key driver of GameStop’s sharp rally.,"In theory, a sharp drop in the stock could prompt those same market makers to unload their shares, potentially speeding up a plunge. That’s what happened last September, after investors piled into call options on tech-related companies such as Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc. The unwind of those positions helped fuel a sharp decline in the Nasdaq.","For now, however, it appears that open interest in GameStop calls has not accumulated significantly, as many buyers of those contracts have traded them the same day, according to Christopher Murphy, co-head of derivatives strategy at Susquehanna Financial Group.","More contracts have remained open among GameStop puts, according to data from Trade Alert. Another key risk would be to market participants who sold those puts, wagering that GameStop shares would not fall below a certain level, if the stock were to tumble significantly below their targets.","But because options prices already account for gigantic swings in the stock, “people who are short options might not lose as much as you think,” Murphy said. Overall, GameStop options are now pricing in daily moves of about 27% over the next month, versus around 8.5% at the start of January, according to Trade Alert.","On the other hand, investors who have held onto calls to position for further gains in GameStop shares could lose their entire investment should the stock not hit their targeted price before the options expire.","A slide in GameStop shares would see short sellers looking to capitalize by finding “attractive exit points,” said Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners. Short sellers sell borrowed shares in a bet that prices will fall and the shares can be bought back at a lower level.","At the same time, a slide could draw new shorts looking to jump on any downward price momentum, Dusaniwsky said. The number of GameStop shares shorted has fallen by more than half in the past week, as shorts have covered their bets, Dusaniwsky said.","If new shorts join in as the stock slides, it would exacerbate the selling, as long holders try to exit their positions to realize profits, Dusaniwsky said."

After ethics violations dogged the Trump administration, some groups are urging Yellen to pre-emptively seek a waiver, and set a precedent.","“This example is a good test of Biden’s ethics executive order and the transparency that follows, but it also highlights the revolving door and why restrictions are necessary to protect the integrity of government missions, policies, and programs,” said Scott Amey, general counsel at Project On Government Oversight, a nonpartisan government watchdog group.","The Treasury secretary normally does not get involved in matters involving individual stocks and concentrates instead on broad systemic risks to the financial system, which the department monitors through daily market surveillance.","“Secretary Yellen of course will abide by her ethics agreement and ethics pledge in all instances,” Treasury spokesman Calvin Mitchell said. He did not indicate how she would approach the specific Citadel issue.","Like many former government officials, including here her Federal Reserve chair predecessor Ben Bernanke, Yellen took speaking fees from private companies after she left government.","Yellen filed an ethics agreement here with the Office of Government Ethics in December saying she would ""seek written authorization to participate personally and substantially in any particular matter"" related to any companies that paid her speaking fees prior to joining President Joe Biden's administration - for a year after her last speech to each firm.","Yellen spoke several times at Citadel, most recently on an Oct. 27 webinar, according to the filing. She was paid at least $700,000 in speaking fees by the Citadel while she was in private practice at the Brookings Institution think tank, another disclosure here shows.","These speaking engagements, which also include financial heavyweights such as Barclays, Citigroup, and Goldman Sachs, are not likely to impact her ability to give Biden broad advice on the stock trading matter, government ethics experts say.","“If this becomes a situation where regulators are considering new rulemaking with Citadel as the poster-child, that’s different,” said Lisa Gilbert, executive vice president of Public Citizen, a group pushing for stronger financial regulation.",A major question is whether volatility from Gamestop and similar retail investor revolts against short-squeezes boil over into a systemic event that sends markets crashing broadly.,"Typically a matter involving an individual stock or equity market trading and brokerages would fall to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has said it is examining the matter.","On Friday, SEC commissioners including acting chair Allison Herren Lee said in a statement here they were closely monitoring the extreme volatility in certain stocks and warned market participants to ""uphold their obligations to protect investors and to identify and pursue potential wrongdoing.""","Extreme stock price volatility “has the potential to expose investors to rapid and severe losses and undermine market confidence,” they added.","Biden’s choice to run the SEC, Gary Gensler, awaits Senate hearings.",The FSOC that Yellen chairs is charged with identifying risks and responding to emerging threats to financial stability. It includes the heads of the Federal Reserve and other major U.S. financial regulatory agencies.,It has the authority to designate non-bank financial institutions for consolidated supervision to minimize risk to the financial system or to break up firms that pose a “grave threat.”,"Distress in individual companies rarely rises to such a level. Treasury maintains daily market surveillance, but it is looking for orderly market functioning and broad systemic threats.","Thus far, the situation looks contained, Barclays said in a note to clients on Friday. Short positions in stocks favored on the Reddit social media site total about $40 billion, which would limit the pain to a handful of hedge funds.","“The ongoing short squeeze in a few stocks by retail investors has raised concerns of a broader contagion. While we believe there is more pain to come, we remain optimistic that it is likely to remain localized,” Barclays said.","Unlike many previous Treasury secretaries, Yellen has only worked as an academic and for the government, not at a bank or trading firm.","Richard Painter, a former top ethics lawyer to President George W. Bush, said many Treasury secretaries had a great deal more entanglements that would raise conflict of interest concerns than Yellen.","Henry Paulson, a Republican who was U.S. Treasury secretary during the 2008 financial meltdown, sold half a billion dollars in stock from his former employer Goldman Sachs Group Inc to satisfy ethics concerns. Paulson later forced Goldman and other major banks to take billions of dollars in taxpayer capital at the depth of the financial crisis.","Steven Mnuchin, Yellen's immediate predecessor, pledged here after he was nominated to divest $94 million in investments, and refrain from any decisions involving CIT Group until August 2018, when he was due a payment of $5 million from the company.","“Yellen is going to be about as clean as you can get on this stuff,” Painter said.",(This story refiles to add in paragraph 3 full company name for Citadel entity that executes Robinhood trades)

Here are some answers:,BEHIND THE SURGE IN INTEREST OF RETAIL INVESTORS:,"More individuals have invested in stocks during the COVID-19 pandemic, and experts cite a number of reasons. Lockdowns boosted savings, policy stimulus put cash into people's pockets, and extremely low interest rates drove investors to the stock market. Also, a proliferation of trading apps allowed anyone with a smartphone to buy or sell stocks for free.","Retail investors' participation in U.S. equity order flows increased to nearly 20% in 2020 from 15% in 2019, while orders from long-only funds fell to 6.4% last year from 9.7% in 2019, data from Swiss bank UBS showed.","Data this year suggests further growth. Online broker eToro said it registered more than 380,000 new users in the first 11 days of 2021, adding to the 5 million who used it last year, for example.","Retail investors are also buying stock options, the right to buy or sell shares at set prices without putting cash upfront. That takes their dollars much farther and can turbocharge share price movements.",,WHAT HAS BEEN THE IMPACT OF THIS SURGE IN RETAIL TRADING?,"Big U.S. technology companies were among the beneficiaries last year. Facebook (FB.O), Amazon (AMZN.O), Apple (AAPL.O), Netflix (NFLX.O) and Google-owner Alphabet (GOOGL.O) saw record inflows as their businesses benefited from lockdowns and their stocks soared.","With unprecedented stimulus and easy money policies from central banks, investors then shifted to smaller stocks, especially ones that got beaten down during the pandemic.","Market capitalization of world stocks surged to a record $88 trillion, a whopping $33 trillion jump from the March bottom. In the last few days, GameStop’s shares have jumped 1600%, with big gains also for shares of AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (AMC.N), Blackberry Ltd , Nokia Oyj and others.",WHAT’S HAPPENING ON REDDIT AND SOCIAL MEDIA?,"Online discussions about stocks on social media platforms such as Reddit, Twitter and Facebook are seen by many traders and analysts as fueling massive share price moves that cannot be explained by fundamental news or traditional valuation metrics. Retail investors have long discussed stocks on social media, but during the pandemic these forums appear to be gaining more influence. Investors pointed to discussion threads such as “WallStreetBets” on Reddit for driving the surge in GameStop.","Professional investors are paying attention. Dennis Dick, a stock trader in Las Vegas said he reads the site Seeking Alpha before work and keeps up to the minute by watching Twitter, but last weekend he also joined a group on Reddit ""because I need to know what's going on."" read more",,HOW HAS THIS AFFECTED HEDGE FUNDS AND PROFESSIONAL TRADERS?,"Massive share price swings for no apparent reason have caught Wall Street off guard. Short sellers, or investors who bet the price of a stock would fall, are getting crushed. Melvin Capital, a well-established hedge fund, took massive losses on its bets that GameStop share would fall.","Traders scrambling to cover these short positions and prevent further losses had to pay inflated prices, which added more fuel to the rally. Several traders told Reuters that this phenomenon -- the classic short-squeeze -- drew in still more retail investors hoping to ride the wave.",WHAT ARE THE RISKS?,"With global stock markets surging since March despite the pandemic’s devastation of the real economy, investors and analysts are warning about asset bubbles. If markets turn, overvalued stocks will fall with them. Many trading platforms also offer loans to investors to buy shares and magnify their returns. In a falling market, that could wipe out people caught on the wrong side of the trade.",
