On Sunday, they agreed a new output curb deal but it has done little to lift oil prices.","Franklin Templeton increased its exposure to Oman by 7% and Bahrain and Saudi Arabia by 3% each since mid-March, he said.","“At the depth of the crisis, we shifted slightly down from higher-quality names into higher-yielding names. For example, selling some Abu Dhabi to buy some Saudi or to be able to buy Oman and Bahrain,” Kronfol said.","He said given where Bahrain and Oman’s debt was trading, investors were expecting them to restructure within two years, which he saw as too simplistic. Kronfol expects decisive action from both countries on spending, for them to have enough resources to navigate the next two years, the Gulf states to express support for Oman and oil to recover.",The yield on Bahrain’s 30-year bonds due in 2047 rose to a peak of 10% on March 20 from about 6% at end-February. Oman’s similar bonds due in 2048 rose to a peak of 12.1% yield from 7% in the same period. They have since recovered to 8% and 10% respectively.,"“The GCC Bond Fund was at about $205 million before this crisis and is now closer to $165 million,” he said, with about half lost due to the market and half due to redemptions.",Kronfol expected Gulf assets under management to rise and said outlook for business remained positive for the year.

But to really be able to (do that), it has to be not just (fundraising) in Malaysia but internationally,” he said in a group interview on Wednesday.","He said Malaysia has attracted foreign companies to issue sukuk, but they were predominantly in ringgit and largely domestically bought.","Mohieddine said there should be more transactions in international currencies like the U.S. dollar, and a currency regime or some central bank support that facilitates that.","“If you want to have a more global role, you need to be able to cater to demand that’s outside of Malaysia,” he said.",“That happens when the currency is a little more freely convertible and when you have issues in different currencies.”,Mohieddine said the Chinese interest in sukuk is nascent but the appetite for sukuk would likely start with big issuers like Chinese real estate and financial services companies.,"“If the sukuk market remains healthy and policy makers take steps to make the Malaysian market more international, and the Chinese look to diversify their source of funding ... (it’s) feasible, arguably, to happen in the next few years,” he said.","Franklin Templeton Investments projects global sukuk growth at 15-20 percent this year on the back of stable oil prices, better growth outlook in markets that issue sukuks and sustained demand for Islamic finance.
