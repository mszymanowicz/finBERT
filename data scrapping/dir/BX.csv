Private equity firm Blackstone is betting that plutocrats will be back in the air before the rest of us. Shares in London-listed Signature Aviation – which provides fuelling and ground services to private jets and charter flights – jumped by 40% on Thursday after it revealed Steve Schwarzman’s firm made a $4.3 billion cash takeover offer. A proposal from a rival investment fund, Global Infrastructure Partners, was rejected.","The bid, a respectable 17% premium to Signature’s pre-Covid high in January, looks like a risky punt on a sector shellacked by Covid. The company made a $30 million pre-tax loss in the first half of 2020 whilst net debt of $2.2 billion equals a turbulent 5 times estimated 2021 EBITDA, according to Refinitiv data. Still, a core market of peripatetic executives criss-crossing the United States appears to have already achieved relative lift-off: its U.S. flight activity was down by around one-fifth year-on-year in October, compared to what IATA reckons was a 61% drop in domestic U.S. air travel more generally.

The luxury giant confirmed on Thursday that French prosecutors are investigating it for tax matters, but denied wrongdoing. A similar spat in Italy over transfer pricing at its top brand Gucci led to a 1.25 billion euro settlement last year. Swiss subsidiary LGI, at the centre of that probe, also offered services to Kering’s French brands, before overhauling the whole system in 2017.","It’s not clear whether French authorities will take the same approach as their counterparts across the Alps. But Gucci’s tax bill was 60% of its 2.1 billion euro recurrent operating income in 2017. A similar hit for its French brands Saint Laurent and Balenciaga, which had combined operating income of 500 million euros that year according to Breakingviews estimates, would only imply a hit of a few hundred million euros. With Kering projected to report 3 billion euros of net income next year, Gucci boss François-Henri Pinault would be able to afford it. (By Lisa Jucca)","MAGICALLY DELICIOUS. General Mills is on a lucky streak with more pet owners and bakers staying indoors. The Lucky Charms cereal maker’s fiscal second-quarter net revenue rose 7% to $4.7 billion as sales of dog food and baking stuff surged at double-digit rates. With Covid-19 cases still rising, the Minneapolis-based company expects those trends to stick around for another quarter or so.","Moreover, earnings increased 19% in part because it charged more for premium products, like Blue Buffalo dog chow, offsetting higher advertising spending. Chief Executive Jeff Harmening said the brand, which General Mills bought two years ago, shows its deals “can add value.” Perhaps further acquisitions will be on the Cheerios maker’s 2021 resolutions list.

A year ago the London-listed payments company was worth 1.3 billion pounds ($1.8 billion), but since then the Travelex operator has been hit by an accounting scandal involving $1 billion of undisclosed debt and its shares have been suspended. On Thursday Abu Dhabi’s state-backed Royal Strategic Partners and Prism Advance Solutions, whose non-executive chairman is former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, struck a deal to buy Finablr for a nominal fee of $1.","The joint bidder will provide working capital to maintain the business operation, and will fork out a price of $190 million if the company succeeds in recovering the missing funds. For Abu Dhabi, it’s a way to save 3,000 jobs at Finablr unit UAE Exchange, which helps foreign workers send money home. For both parties, it cements the “normalization agreement” Tel Aviv signed with Abu Dhabi back in August. With $4 billion in expected annual trade between the two, that may make sense.

That’s thanks to 80% of its investors voting in favour of letting the board raise up to 4 billion Norwegian crowns ($458 million) through a sale of hybrid bonds. It’s the second win for the $284 million airline this month, after it secured protection from its creditors in a bid to convert debt to equity. Its shares were up nearly 10% on the news.","Still, clear skies are a long way off. Chief Executive Jacob Schram has to haggle with creditors as he seeks to reduce debt and liabilities of $7 billion. The bigger challenge may be to convince new investors that it has a viable future and secure new investment for its debt sale. But if he fails to raise the necessary funds, Schram reckons the carrier will run out of cash by March. For now, the airline can argue it still has a route back to recovery.

Emmanuel Macron has tested positive for Covid-19, the French presidency announced on Thursday, offering a potent reminder that even as vaccines are rolled out, the virus is still virulent and has no political allegiance. The centrist politician joins other leaders as diverse as Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro, U.S. President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson among those to contract the disease.","Those leaders recovered, which bodes well for the relatively healthy and youthful Macron. Yet his condition could still have consequences. It comes just as the European Union is trying to finalise a trade deal with Britain. Though the European Commission is leading the talks, an active Macron may be needed to approve any last-minute compromise.

That’s the bullish message from WPP, which reckons it can resume share buybacks next year, pay a progressive dividend and ramp up spending by up to 500 million pounds per year to win new clients. Most importantly, the world’s biggest ad agency is aiming to get net sales back to 2019 levels by 2022, one year ahead of the previous schedule.","Chief Executive Mark Read’s plans to juice up the company’s margin caught the most attention. He intends to deliver an operating margin between 15.5% and 16% in 2023, a steep jump from the 11% analysts expect this year, according to Refinitiv. That could be delivered by 600 million pounds of cost savings and working with clients like L’Oreal and Ford Motor to move their marketing and sales online.

It’s “as close as you can get to a true V-shaped recovery”, Kiwibank Chief Economist Jarrod Kerr marvelled.","Strong domestic consumption – likely pent-up demand from strict lockdown measures earlier this year – seems to have offset the toll of closed borders and lost tourism. Fiscal and monetary stimulus also played a role, though house prices now risk overheating.

His anointed successor, Benoit Ribadeau-Dumas, who has never worked in the insurance sector, will become Kessler’s deputy in the interim.","Since rebuffing an 8.2 billion euro takeover bid by Covea in 2018, Scor shares have fallen by 22%, while peers Hannover Re and Munich Re have seen their stock rise.

But in merging Paysafe, a payments company it co-owns with fellow buyout group CVC, with a listed cash shell, Steve Schwarzman’s firm has shown there’s a price for convenience. In this case, it’s around $1.2 billion.","Three years after they bought the digital payments firm, Blackstone and CVC are cutting their stake in Paysafe by just over half and merging it with a special-purpose acquisition company backed by financial mogul Bill Foley. Factoring in a 20% increase in the value of the SPAC’s shares on Monday, Blackstone and CVC will take out $2.3 billion of cash and hold on to just under $4 billion of stock, worth a total of $6.3 billion.","On paper, that means the buyout firms are taking a haircut. Based on the SPAC’s share price on Monday after the deal was announced, investors think Paysafe’s enterprise value is around $10.4 billion. Deduct the $2.9 billion of net debt it has today – in other words, before doing the SPAC deal – and the theoretical value of the private owners’ stock is more like $7.5 billion. It’s as if they’ve given up $1.2 billion, a little more than 15% of their value, to list the shares, extract cash and bring payments expert Foley on board.","While that sounds like a lot, it’s pretty attractive for a buyout firm like Blackstone. In a traditional initial public offering, shareholders would expect the owners to sell shares cheaply enough that the stock can rise on the first day. There would be fees to pay to bankers, perhaps $250 million on a deal of this size. Most importantly, it would be hard to raise a substantial amount of new money and sell lots of shares without sending a negative signal to new buyers, which might punish the valuation.","There are likely to be more where this came from. Paysafe is not Blackstone’s first sale of a company through a SPAC. And many private equity owners have one eye on speedy exits, since U.S. President-elect Joe Biden has vowed to increase the taxes they pay on investment gains. The convenience afforded by SPACs comes at a price, but it’s one buyout firms will be happy enough to pay."

Regulators have suspended the Australian casino operator’s gaming licence for its new luxury Sydney complex. As the company and billionaire James Packer consider their options, private equity firm Blackstone looks well-suited to be a buyer.","Delaying the December opening of the $1.6 billion waterfront property raises the spectre of authorities withholding the licence altogether. The company is trying to appease them, by shaking up its board, pay practices and corporate culture. It also vowed to stop working with unregulated junkets that bring high rollers from China.","A year-long inquiry into compliance and governance took a disturbing turn last week, however. Local gaming officials were clearly rattled after seeing fresh evidence of lapses in Crown’s anti-money laundering protocols. Moody’s downgraded its credit rating on Friday.","That intensifies the pressure on $4.6 billion Crown. Finding a new owner might be the best solution, even if it forces Packer to sell the last piece of his family’s empire with the shares down by a quarter over the last year. He has considered cashing out before. Talks with Wynn Resorts fell apart in 2019. And the billionaire agreed to offload a big slug of his stake to former joint venture partner Melco Resorts & Entertainment, before the arrangement unravelled just as the inquiry began.","Blackstone bought a 10% stake in April and has a track record that suggests it could want more. It is no stranger to the gambling industry and knows how to wheel and deal in real estate. It arranged a leaseback arrangement for the Bellagio in Las Vegas which farmed out management, and risk, to MGM Resorts International while it collected steady rent revenue. Blackstone also sold pieces of Hilton Worldwide during its ownership and profitably broke up Sam Zell’s Equity Office Properties after paying $39 billion for it in 2007.","Its lodging nous also might help reposition Crown as it faces the prospect of fewer Chinese VIPs. When they went missing amid President Xi Jinping’s corruption crackdown, the company’s bottom line shrank considerably in 2015. There will undoubtedly be other possibilities for Crown and Packer, but a Blackstone future may be in the cards."

Blue-chip investors’ endorsement of Tontine indicates Wall Street is confident of Ackman’s ability to find a successful deal.","Guggenheim Partners owns 22 million Tontine shares worth roughly $507 million, while Seth Klarman’s Baupost owns 17.5 million shares or roughly $400 million, the filings show.",Ontario Teachers owns a stake worth $257 million while the T. Rowe Price stake is valued at $174 million.,"Hedge funds Soroban Capital, Millennium Management, Fir Tree Capital Management, Citadel Advisors, Mason Capital Management, Moore Capital Management and Scoggin Management also have stakes in Tontine, according to the filings.","Most Tontine investors are based in North America, but the SPAC also counts sovereign wealth funds in Asia, the Middle East and Europe as shareholders, sources familiar with the matter said.","While many SPACs give their managers so-called founder shares that can result in them owning 20% of the merged company, Ackman opted out of that compensation structure. He is also set to receive warrants that require him to invest more money to own less of the target company than managers of other SPACs.","Tontine shareholders also receive warrants, but unlike with other SPACs they forfeit two-thirds of their value if they cash out when a merger is announced. Ackman did this to discourage investors with a short-term horizon from participating in Tontine’s IPO.","Tontine is not Ackman’s first SPAC. He co-sponsored Justice Holdings in 2011, which raised $1.5 billion and merged with Burger King Worldwide a year later. The company is now called Restaurant Brands International, and remains one of Ackman’s biggest investments.","Ackman is best known for his big wins as an activist shareholder in railroad operator Canadian Pacific and Botox maker Allergan, though he also suffered deep losses at pharmaceutical company Valeant and nutritional supplements manufacturer Herbalife. Since his $12.5 billion firm’s launch in 2004, Ackman has returned an average 16% annually, compared with the Standard & Poor’s 9.3% gain. This year, his Pershing Square Holdings fund is up 55%."

We are very well positioned to navigate the road ahead with our long-term committed capital model and an industry-record $156 billion of dry powder,” Blackstone Chief Executive Steve Schwarzman said in a statement, referring to unspent capital.","Total assets under management, which include real estate, private equity corporate credit and investments in hedge funds, rose to $564.3 billion from $538 billion reported in March, supported by strong fundraising. Many of these assets generated management fees that boosted Blackstone’s fee-related earnings by 28% year-on-year to $541 million. Revenue from performance fees that rely on asset sales, on the other hand, dropped 70% to $102 million.","“Performance fees missed what the street expected, but that’s understandable given the current environment,” said Morgan Stanley analyst Michael Cyprys. “This was partly offset by their beat on fee-related earnings driven by better management fees and lower compensation expenses.”","In June, the U.S. Department of Labor issued guidance allowing private equity funds to be offered as an investment option to defined contribution retirement plans, including 401 (k) plans. Blackstone said it expects to gain a significant share of the capital that will flow into the 401 (k) industry.","“We think this decision by the DOL was a step in the right direction for sure,” Blackstone President Jonathan Gray said in an analyst earnings call on Thursday. “And the size, it could be in the multiple hundred billions dollars for the industry in terms of additional assets.”",Blackstone declared a quarterly dividend of 37 cents per share.

CVC Capital Partners is also among the final bidders, they said.","The sale of Takeda Consumer Healthcare Co, known for its Alinamin line of energy drinks, is part of Takeda’s efforts to shed $10 billion in non-core assets to reduce debt following its $59 billion purchase of Shire Plc.","That deal amount might fall to around 340 billion yen because Blackstone Group BX.N and the private equity firms consider the price too high, said two of those people. Taisho could go as high as 400 billion yen, they said.","Blackstone, Takeda, Taisho and Bain declined to comment.

The U.S. economy ended its longest expansion on record in February and went into recession, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research on Monday. The peak came 128 months after the post-financial crisis recovery began in the middle of President Barack Obama’s first year in office.","The committee that referees such things noted that because of the very sharp dropoff in economic activity in March, the peak quarter for the U.S. economy was the last period of 2019. The date mismatch is one more challenge to traditional data norms created by the coronavirus pandemic. Typically the peak month and quarter are the same or at least adjacent.","The NBER also designated this a recession unusually quickly. That reflects the breadth and depth of the downturn, but it’s also a nod to the possibility that it could be over quickly. Six months is the shortest to date. Maybe that’s yet another record that will fall to the pandemic. (By Richard Beales)","SHOTGUN. Grubhub is trying to take the wheel from Uber Technologies. Rivals Just Eat Takeaway.com and Delivery Hero are also interested in buying the U.S.-based food delivery service, according to CNBC on Friday. Those deals make less sense – unless they were used to force Uber’s hand.","The ride-hailing service and Grubhub are haggling over the exchange ratio for an all-stock deal and the reverse break fee. Because of overlap, watchdogs will likely take a critical view. But market similarities are also crucial: UBS reckons a merger could result in more than $500 million in cost savings.","Meanwhile European competitors would have a lower bar for regulatory clearance, but, consequently, meager benefits from a deal. They could overpay, but a transaction ultimately is less likely. So Grubhub is best sticking to its other power play. Covid-19 has boosted business as delivery has come in high demand. That’s not the case for $65 billion Uber, which is suffering from a dearth of riders. (By Jennifer Saba)","DIFFICULT TAKEOFF. Wanderlust is returning, fitfully. Almost one-fifth of respondents in a UBS survey say they are ready to travel, over twice as many as two months earlier. And over 440,000 people passed through security on June 7, according to the Transportation Security Administration, more than quadruple the average in early April.","It is a start, but there is a long way to go. Airport traffic is still 80% lower than a year ago. American Airlines is preparing severance packages for high-level employees for when the terms of a recent government bailout expire, according to CNBC. Delta Air Lines said last week it will stop serving 11 cities.",Stock prices of major U.S. carriers are above their mid-March levels. But that says more about government support than imminent recovery. Over 40% of UBS respondents still don’t plan to travel for six months or more. That suggests a long summer of empty seats and dwindling cash piles. (By Lauren Silva Laughlin),"FLOWERS FOR BLACKSTONE. Steve Schwarzman’s buyout group in February struck a deal to buy Dutch bank NIBC for 1.3 billion euros. It has been clear for a while that the pre-pandemic price would have to be renegotiated. But Blackstone seems to have turned adversity into opportunity, knocking one-fifth off the price according to a statement on Monday.","Though it’s risky to take a bank private at the start of a downturn, Schwarzman’s dealmakers have a margin of safety. At 7 euros a share, Blackstone is paying investors like J.C. Flowers – which first bought into the bank in 2005 – two-thirds of 2020 tangible book value, using ABN Amro forecasts. That’s roughly where the top 20 European banks trade, before any takeout premium. Moreover, Citigroup analysts are forecasting an 8.5% return on equity for NIBC next year – higher than many other banks. Crisis dealmaking, when sellers have few other alternatives, has its advantages. (By Liam Proud)","TOUGH JOB. Economists are bad at predicting the future – now understanding the present may be tough too. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ jobs report on Friday showed a shocking decline in the unemployment rate to around 13%. But as the bureau conceded, the rate would have been roughly 3 percentage points higher if workers classified as employed but not currently working for “other reasons,” above normal May levels, had been labeled as unemployed.","So does this change the story? Not really, because the same caveat applied in April: The 15% rate for that month would have increased by almost 5 percentage points. The numbers are slippery but the direction still holds.","Monthly economic reports don’t normally deal with such dramatic change, definitional uncertainty or distortion from massive government stimulus. The result, though, is that odd data points can easily appear to contradict other statistics. Financial pundits can still try to find trends – but with a big dose of humility. (By Anna Szymanski)","PUBLI-CAN’T. The British government’s plan to reopen pubs and restaurants on June 22 lifted stocks in chain Mitchells & Butlers by more than 15% while Marston’s, which also has breweries, rose 12%. Allowing establishments with outdoor spaces to operate two weeks earlier than previously expected is obviously good for the sector, but that reaction looks anything but rational.","Analysts are more sober. They predict a revenue decline of 30% for Marston’s and 36% for Mitchells & Butlers in the year ending in September, according to Refinitiv. Social distancing measures, even if reduced to keeping punters a metre apart, are going to eat into capacity, and many punters will stick to parks and gardens this summer. Investors, in their thirst for good news, are getting ahead of themselves. (By Dasha Afanasieva)","ELECTRIC FEEL. Boris Johnson may be following Angela Merkel’s lead. The UK prime minister is considering mimicking Germany’s plan to subsidise electric cars. According to the Telegraph, drivers will be given up to 6,000 pounds if they trade in their gas guzzlers for a battery-powered vehicle. Ironically, emissions-free cars were the only section of the market to register a year-on-year increase in sales last month as the rest of the market collapsed, but only by 429 vehicles, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.","Electric cars have accounted for just 4% of total sales so far this year, or roughly half Germany’s proportion. If Johnson wanted to double that it would cost him around 454 million pounds based on last year’s totals, assuming the full subsidy is applied. Faced with uncertain Brexit negotiations, the move might also buy him some goodwill with Nissan Motor and BMW, both of whom produce electric models in Britain. (By Christopher Thompson)",FASHION FRENZY. Wobbly brand Salvatore Ferragamo is enjoying a market revival. Shares in the Italian maker of finely crafted leather shoes jumped 8% on Friday amid hopes it could fall prey to luxury giant LVMH. This seems premature. The coronavirus crisis has clearly turned the 2.4 billion euro Italian brand into a target. But the French giant remains preoccupied with its $16.2 billion bid for famed U.S. jeweller Tiffany & Co.,"At 2.7 times expected revenue, Ferragamo looks cheap compared to peers. But it’s too small to move the needle at Bernard Arnault’s 200 billion euro behemoth. Ferragamo needs a fresher look and investment. Assuming a 30% premium, a buyer would need to double the company’s operating margin and grow annual revenue by 5% a year until 2025 to earn a positive return on capital, Breakingviews calculations show. A private-equity takeover, or a marriage with a similar-sized local peer like Ermenegildo Zegna makes more sense. (By Lisa Jucca)","CHEQUE PLEASE. Suntory boss and government adviser Takeshi Niinami reckons more than 20% of bars and restaurants could fail due to the coronavirus pandemic. The owner of premium spirits brands Jim Beam and Maker’s Mark depends on the $230 billion local dining scene, and that explains why Suntory is backing Saki-meshi, a dining app that allows customers to pay for meals up to 180 days in advance to help restaurants with cash flow.","It’s similar to how American restaurants have sold dining bonds, or discounted gift certificates, but those unsecured debts can have little recovery value if the lights go out in ramen joints and tapas-style izakaya bars. With Japan’s vast economic stimulus package favouring subsidy support for premium ingredients like wagyu beef and melons over eating establishments, no wonder Suntory is tweaking the menu.

They expressed concerns about aggressive terms both on pricing and in the debt documentation on the Merlin fundraising.,Blackstone did not immediately respond to a request for comment.,Merlin had already taken out a £2.193 billion ($2.81 billion) loan as part of the leveraged buyout.,"On Thursday, Merlin issued around $821 million-equivalent of bonds to help fund the buyout.","Analysts and investors said the bonds, split between a 370 million euro ($411.63 million) eight-year issue with a coupon of 4.5% and a $410 million eight-year dollar tranche with a coupon of 6.625%, was pushing new boundaries in terms of yields achieved on such debt.","“We don’t think at this yield you are remunerated for the risk associated with some of Merlin’s planned projects,” said Benjamin Sabahi, head of credit research at independent analyst firm Spread Research.","“Merlin has a very strong track record, is well diversified, and has long-term agreements in place. But this time it’s something larger, more aggressive from a credit perspective,” he said.",Bond issues for leveraged buyouts generally tend to have a higher yield.,"Blackstone’s buyout of Refinitiv in September 2018 was considered one of the most aggressive deals at that time, International Financing Review, a Refinitiv company, reported.","Thomson Reuters, the parent company of Reuters News, holds 45% of Refinitiv.","Analysts highlighted the terms in the debt documentation on the Merlin debt deal, which was seen by Reuters, as a particular area of concern.","The terms give Merlin significant leeway to raise further debt, allowing it to convert double the amount of its dividend payment allowance into capacity to raise debt, analysts at Covenant Review said. The analysts also said they had never seen such terms in a high-yield deal before.","High-yield bond documents typically include restrictions on how much debt an issuer can raise, as well as how much it can pay in dividends and other distributions away from creditors – known as restricted payments.","Sabahi of Spread Research said the terms allowed the company to take on another 1.2 billion euros of debt for future projects and acquisitions, which would increase leverage by an additional 2.4x. Merlin will have a leverage of 5.9 times after the buyout, analysts said.","There have been a string of aggressively priced deals in the European junk bond market as investors demand for bonds has been supercharged by low supply and the ECB’s decision to restart asset purchases, including corporate bonds.","“ECB purchases are providing a broad-based demand for risk. You go to these [investor roadshow] lunches and they are unbelievably well-attended,” said a London-based senior fixed-income analyst, who asked not to be identified speaking about the Merlin deal.",“I think that the language on these deals is broadly recognized. But the ability for people to do some sort of cohesive pushback against these deals is simply not materializing as people are hunting around for risk.” he said.

The deal is the largest buyout financing since the crisis and its launch has been eagerly awaited since the deal was underwritten in January.","Syndication is likely to overlap with Akzo Nobel’s €7.3 billion-equivalent debt syndication, which backs Carlyle and GIC’s carve-out of the company’s specialty chemicals business, but arranging banks believe that there is sufficient liquidity in the European and US markets to absorb the two jumbo deals.","“The market can take it; there’s a huge amount of liquidity out there,” a senior leveraged finance banker said, adding that the workload on investors will be spread among analysts as the deals are in different sectors.","“The analysts on the buyside looking at these two deals are going to be different people so it shouldn’t be a problem,” the banker said.","Lead banks JP Morgan, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citigroup launched Thomson Reuters’ financing, which comprises a US$8bn Term Loan B and a US$5.5bn bridge loan, to large institutional investors in late June. BAML is leading the loans and JP Morgan the bonds.","The financing package is largely unchanged, bankers said, despite a softening in the market in the early summer in Europe as investors took a tougher line with arranging banks amid a surge in supply.","Indicative pricing on Thomson Reuters term loans is 400bp, of which US$2.5bn-equivalent is expected in euros. Several buyout loans, including a €2.6bn deal backing the buyout of German energy metering business Techem, closed at 375bp in July. Pricing was adjusted higher on Techem’s loan from initial guidance of 350bp.","Ebitda adjustments and leverage for Thomson Reuters’ F&R division have not undergone any material changes from the previously reported numbers of US$650m and leverage of roughly six times respectively, which takes the business’s Ebitda from the $1.7 billion reported number to near US$2.4bn, the senior leveraged finance banker said.","“The deal has a lot of the classic features of a leveraged buyout; there are a lot of opportunities for cost cuts. If anything the leverage may be lower than before but there’s not much change there,” he said.","Leverage was previously expected to be around 4.5 times through the secured debt and 5.6 times total debt after Ebitda adjustments, which could be as much as 30%, as the transaction is a carve-out and involves reallocating costs.","The deal also includes US$1bn of preferred equity – with a 14.5% Payment-In-Kind (PIK) coupon – US$3bn of cash equity from Blackstone and US$2.5bn of existing equity, based on the F&R unit’s $20 billion valuation, that will be rolled over.","While Blackstone’s carve-out is still awaiting further regulatory approvals, including the US, after securing EU approval on July 23, this is unlikely to delay the debt syndication. Loan investors will earn a commitment fee on the bridge loan and a ticking fee on the Term Loan B before the deal closes.","“With any leveraged buyout you don’t want to waste investors’ time if the deal isn’t sure to happen but Thomson Reuters is very well advanced,” the banker added.","Blackstone announced on January 30 that it was buying a 55% majority stake in Thomson Reuters’ F&R unit, which includes LPC.
