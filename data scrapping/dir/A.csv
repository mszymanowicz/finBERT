CMG.N.","Fresh from posting a 58.1% return after fees in 2019, Ackman kicked off 2020 with a portfolio update that also mentioned his latest investment in Agilent Technologies Inc A.N for the first time.","He sees a bright future for the testing-equipment company, saying it is currently underleveraged and that there is “substantial opportunity for further improvement.” He and his analysts see more than 800 basis points margin opportunity, far more than the company’s projected 50 to 70 basis points of annual margin expansion over the next few years.","Ackman said Agilent is delivering strong performance under the current leadership team and that he paid an average $76.58 per share for the stake. The company’s share price, including dividends, has increased 12% from his average purchase cost in 2019 and is off 2% this year.",Agilent was one of two new investments made in 2019.,"Pershing Square, which now manages $8.5 billion in assets, ranks as one of the industry’s most powerful activist investors where managers push corporations to perform better. Several years ago Ackman opted to take on a lower public profile, prompting investors to closely follow anything he says about his positions publicly.",Pershing Square also exited its investment in Starbucks “after prospective returns became more modest following a total shareholder return of 73% in the 19 months that we owned” it.,"He is sticking with Chipotle, last year’s biggest winner for the firm with a 14.7% return, saying management has a “clear plan to drive continued progress in 2020.”","Ackman also reported that David Klafter, a lawyer who had been a member of his investment team, moved to work for Ackman’s family office."

Ackman’s $7 billion fund earlier in the year bought Berkshire Hathaway Inc shares.,"The filing did not say whether the Agilent investment will be active or passive, and Ackman’s spokesman declined to comment. The filing showed that Pershing Square owned 2.9 million shares at the end of September and did not say how big the position is currently. At Monday’s stock price, that stake would be worth $246 million.","Ackman, who cemented his reputation as one of the world’s most widely followed activist investors with bets on Canadian Pacific and Chipotle Mexican Grill, among others, told investors last month that he had a new position but declined to name it.","That hint sparked heavy speculation about the possible target with guesses ranging from Adobe Inc to Yum Brands, but the name was successfully kept under wraps.",The new position was announced at the end of a banner year for Ackman when his publicly traded fund has gained 51%.,"Agilent, which serves the life sciences, diagnostics and applied chemical markets, was created two decades ago when it was spun off from Hewlett-Packard.","In the last year, its stock price has climbed 15.63% while the Standard & Poors 500 index has gained 19%. The company’s biggest investors include index funds Vanguard Group, BlackRock and State Street as well as T.Rowe Price Associates and Wellington Management.",Ackman’s firm has not yet made a so-called 13D filing which is required if an owner’s stake exceeds 5%.,"For roughly two years, Ackman has kept a lower profile and worked to recapture his reputation as a skillful investor after certain bets, including a 2015 investment in Valeant Pharmaceuticals, soured, leaving the firm with heavy losses that sparked investor exits.",He stopped jetting around the world to visit investors. Instead he concentrated on finding new ideas and promised to update investors at periodic dinners and on conference calls.,The Berkshire bet sparked questions about how active Ackman still is and what he is doing to prod management to perform better. He acknowledged that he has not spoken Berkshire’s founder Warren Buffett following his recent investment.
