That means in theory they could justify a premium of about $20 per Hartford share. So far, Chubb’s best offer is about $15 above Hartford’s undisturbed value, nearly a 30% premium.","On that simple math, Chubb has room to go to around $75. The $74 billion company has said, however, that it will be disciplined and investors have sent its shares down around 5% since March. And some analysts peg Hartford’s worth at $80 per share or more. In a conservative industry, Greenberg is already out on a limb making an unsolicited bid. It might be a step too far to bridge the gap.

Building scale in that sector is critical, because small businesses tend to pay small premiums, said analyst Paul Newsome at Piper Sandler in Chicago.","Hartford Financial or “The Hartford” as it is known, dates back to 1810 when it was founded as the Hartford Fire Insurance Co.","Some analysts said the offer undervalued Hartford and suggested the price could rise to more than $29 billion.

If insurers had been required to cover losses from business customers affected by the pandemic, it would cost them as much as $431 billion a month, according to an industry group. Critics have called that figure inflated.",Litigation related to existing policies sent shockwaves through the industry because of potential losses. The new language aims to snuff out ambiguity.,"“Rather than have those terms continue to be undefined, insurers are including definitions to expressly reference COVID-19 or other SARS-related viruses,” said Alan Lyons, who chairs the insurance and reinsurance group at law firm Herrick, Feinstein LLP in New York.","Pandemic-hit U.S. businesses have filed nearly 1,500 lawsuits challenging insurers who denied claims, according to the UPenn litigation tracker.","Judges have handed insurers victories by dismissing about 81% of the 205 state and federal lawsuits decided so far. But among just the state decisions, insurers have lost 65% of cases when policies lacked virus exclusions and 43% even when there was an exclusion, said Tom Baker, professor at UPenn Law.","“Because the governing law is state law, the early decisions from federal courts may not be as predictive of ultimate outcomes as those in state courts,” Baker said.","Insurers have argued that business-interruption policies are intended to cover property damage, which the pandemic did not cause, and that their language does not specifically cover infectious illnesses and often includes exclusionary phrases.","“The policyholders are not entitled to recover because the virus does not damage property,” said Michael Menapace, an insurance lawyer at Wiggin and Dana LLP who also works with the Insurance Information Institute, an industry association.","The court battles are not over, and some insurers have faced legal setbacks.","However, stronger language about communicable diseases has added extra security for insurers, whose own businesses have been hit by the economic decline and near-zero interest rates.","Plaintiffs attorneys remain hopeful. They point to victories in Ohio and in the United Kingdom, where courts found insurers liable for some claims, even on policies with virus exclusions.

Even this year we have so far seen only moderate price increases on average, with higher price jumps for particularly exposed COVID-19 trials,” said Mark Piazzi, senior underwriter liability at Allianz Global Corporate & Specialty (AGCS).","This was echoed by David Briggs, managing director, life sciences practice at Gallagher, who said every trial was rated on its methods and the kinds of patients involved.","Gallagher said premiums in Britain, for example, started at about 5,000 pounds ($6,500) per trial.","Total claims limits in policies were typically set at roughly $6-12 million, depending on the country’s rules, according to several insurance companies interviewed by Reuters.","In Britain, for instance, claim limits were usually set at no lower than 5 million pounds, while in Germany the figure was around 10 million euros ($11.8 million).",‘LOSS EXPERIENCE NOT DRAMATIC’,"However part of the reason why premiums have not risen as sharply as some people might have expected is that claims from trial are generally uncommon, according to executives. This is because patients have often signed so-called informed consent agreements, they said.","Jim Walters, managing director of Life Sciences & Chemical Group at broker Aon AON.N, said such agreements outlined the risks that patients were taking by participating in the trial.","“So, you know, everything from you could have a sore spot on your arm. To you could potentially die. And you know, they would literally go that far in some of these protocols,” he added.",“Those generally tend to hold up in courts and in legal systems around the world. That means that the loss experience coming out of clinical trials is not very dramatic.”,"Claims are often limited to circumstances linked to the improper conduct of trials or any wrongdoing, rather than side-effects of the treatment, executives said.","Such have been the worries about the vaccine race among some members of the public, who fear safety standards could slip, that nine developers issued a joint pledge last month to “uphold the integrity of the scientific process”.",AstraZeneca AZN.L and Oxford University's suspension of global Phase III trials of their experimental COVID-19 vaccine early last month due to a participant's illness brought the risk of side effects in clinical trials to the public fore.,"But the insurers said such delays were not unexpected, and could even reflect the extra caution of vaccine developers given the lack of data about COVID-19.","""Side effects always happen with clinical trials, but these are typically mild and expected. It is not very common to delay or suspend trials, it does happen though,"" said Piazzi at AGCS, whose main peers in underwriting trials include Chubb CB.BN, HDI TLXGn.DE and Fairfax's FFH.TO Newline.","“Pharma companies and insurers alike are even more careful than usual with COVID-19 trials because there is so much at stake, particularly for the patients’ safety.”","All trials of the vaccine candidate have resumed, with the exception of the U.S. study.","There have been examples in recent memory of drug trials going catastrophically wrong, though.","In 2016, for instance, one participant died and five were hospitalised in a Phase I trial run by French company Biotrial in the city of Rennes, testing an experimental mood brightener made by Portuguese drugmaker Bial.","In 2006, six patients required intensive care after receiving a potential treatment against leukaemia and auto-immune disease in London. One was described as looking like “the elephant man” after his head swelled. Another lost fingertips and toes. Germany’s TeGenero, the initial developer of the medicine, folded.","But insurance executives stress such disasters are rare, given the thousands of clinical drug trials being carried out every year.","Walters of Aon, speaking about the 2016 trial, said it was “obviously a horrible situation”.","“But that’s one of very few incidents of really bad loss experience that the industry has faced. So, clinical trial insurance is not hugely expensive. Let’s put it that way.”"

Outbreaks of the novel coronavirus and a related respiratory disease called COVID-19 in such centers only exacerbated the problem.,"""It was already on an upward trajectory but COVID accelerated it,"" Deepa Desai, who heads insurance broker Aon Plc's AON.N healthcare practice, said about rates.","Senior care facilities need general and professional liability insurance, which protect against everything from slip-and-fall incidents to staff-member mistakes that harm patients.","Senior-care providers with expiring policies have struggled to find insurers that will offer coverage in recent months, as some imposed moratoriums on new business deals and others jacked up prices to unaffordable levels, brokers said.","For instance, insurance company Chubb Ltd CB.BN imposed a moratorium on new senior-community clients in March, two sources familiar with the matter said. Chubb recently ended the moratorium but is being highly selective about terms and clients it accepts, they said. A Chubb spokesman declined to comment.","Senior-care communities who can renew policies are paying far more for less coverage, industry sources said. Some insurers are adding exclusions not just for the novel coronavirus, but for communicable diseases at large. Exclusions for costs related to class-action lawsuits are also cropping up.","On June 19, families of three patients who died from COVID-19 at Summit Manor sued the Columbia, Kentucky-based nursing home, saying it failed to protect residents. A spokeswoman for Signature HealthCare, which owns the facility, declined comment.","To mitigate those risks, insurers are requiring customers to answer ""COVID-19 questionnaires"" that ask about previous outbreaks, visitation procedures and preparations for a second wave, said Joanne Wankmiller, national senior care practice leader for Marsh, insurance brokerage unit of Marsh & McLennan Companies Inc MMC.N.",Church Mutual Insurance Co’s five-page questionnaire asks about personal protective gear supplies.,"“We have concerns about new shortages being able to emerge again,” said Jim Ketterson, the company’s senior living director.","It is not yet clear how higher insurance rates are impacting the U.S. senior care industry, but pandemic-related expenses have already pushed some entities into the red.","Hallworth House, a Providence, Rhode Island-based nursing home, said last month that it would close in August after losing more than $1.3 million during the past two years. The pandemic sickened more than half of its 51 residents and 20 staff members in recent months, and 12 residents died.","The industry is also experiencing lower revenue, as the pandemic keeps prospective customers away.","Nursing home occupancy fell nearly 6 percentage points to 79% in April from 85% in February, according to the National Investment Center for Seniors Housing & Care. That is partly because of state and local lockdowns and fewer referrals for care by some insurance plans due to federal restrictions.","The senior-care industry is lobbying for broad federal immunity from lawsuits and also pinning its hopes on efforts in at least 21 states to grant various forms of immunity, including to nursing homes and health care providers.","In the meantime, some senior care companies are thinking about creating insurance cooperatives to offset surging rates, said Barbara Duffy, a Seattle-based lawyer who advises senior communities on insurance.","“These staggering bills could bring the profession to a breaking point,” Duffy said."

COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, would be excluded.","Small businesses would receive a pre-determined payment based on payroll expenses, which the policy would cover for up to three months.","Chubb’s small-business proposal would require all business insurers to participate. Businesses would pay premiums only for the insurers’ share of coverage, not the government’s, making premiums “very affordable,” Greenberg said.","The proposal also includes a program for businesses with more than 500 employees, which would be voluntary for insurers and provide a total of up to $400 billion in coverage through a government reinsurance entity.","Insurers would share up to $15 billion during the program’s first year, rising to $40 billion during its 10th.

Now he fears for the future as he battles for the compensation.","Duckett is one of thousands who have called their insurers to claim on business disruption policies as the spread of the new coronavirus forces large parts of the global economy to shut down, with the answer for most a straight “no”.","As the industry increasingly comes under fire, critics ranging from U.S. President Donald Trump to groups of celebrity chefs have joined the call for payouts to be made.","But insurers, already facing huge payouts on travel and trade credit insurance and the cancellation of sporting events such as the Wimbledon tennis championship, say clauses allowing claims due to government closures or communicable diseases often do not apply to the widespread lockdowns in place to stem the spread of the coronavirus.","Meanwhile, market volatility has also slashed normally comfortable investment income and if insurers were forced to make payouts on policies that do not cover the pandemic, “it would damage or destroy the insurance industry in a terrible way,” Evan Greenberg, CEO of Chubb, one of the world’s largest insurers, said this week.",Greenberg said the pandemic would in any case likely spur the largest single loss in insurance history.,UBS estimates industry insured losses for non-U.S. business interruption total $7-22 billion.,"In the U.S., monthly small business losses are seen at between $255 billion and $431 billion, according to the American Property Casualty Insurance Association, dwarfing the roughly $6 billion a month in premiums the local industry receives for key property insurance lines. It is unclear how much of their losses are insured for the pandemic.","A payout can’t come soon enough for Larry Brehm, owner of a Play It Again Sports store in Torrance, California, who has been told by insurer Nova Casualty Company, a unit of The Hanover Insurance Group that he is not eligible to make a claim as his policy does not cover the virus.","“If I don’t get some kind of help, either from the government or from the...loss of business insurance, then I might have to close. It’s the only way that I feed my family and it’s very sad to think about.”","Hanover said it could not comment on the particular case, but was “committed to delivering on our promises to our customers”.",Lazy Claire’s Duckett is in one of at least three groups of small businesses in Britain squaring up to Lloyd’s of London insurer Hiscox.,Lawyers at Fieldfisher and DMH Stallard also said they had clients seeking payouts from Hiscox and other UK-based insurers.,"Hiscox said this week it would work with the industry, regulators and customers to “seek means of expediting resolution through the range of independent mechanisms available”.","Trump weighed in on the issue during an April 10 briefing, saying he had spoken to restaurateurs who had been paying for business interruption cover for 35 years.","“They’ve been paying a lot of money for a lot of years...And then when they finally need it, the insurance company says, ‘we’re not going to give it’,” Trump said. “We can’t let that happen.”","A group of famed U.S. restaurateurs, including Wolfgang Puck and Thomas Keller, owner of the upmarket French Laundry in California’s Napa Valley, last month banded together with Louisiana lawyer John W. Houghtaling to form the “Business Interruption Group,” or BIG, a non-profit organisation launched to push for payouts.","“If insurers do not start paying...we will bring BIG legal action in every state,” the group said.","In Britain, celebrity chef Raymond Blanc, who runs 36 restaurants through his Brasserie Barco group, has hired law firm Legal Risk.","“We think our policy is bullet-proof,” Brasserie Barco Chairman Mark Derry said.","Analysts say it is hard to strip out business interruption from other commercial property policies, though McKinsey estimates the specific cover earns $40 billion in annual premiums globally.","One issue is whether a virus can be described as causing physical damage, often a pre-requisite to trigger payments.",Epidemics are generally excluded although businesses can buy additional cover. But that extra policy might specify the diseases it covers - meaning the new coronavirus that only appeared in recent months would not be included.,"Some businesses buy extra coverage for a government-mandated shutdown, but again, this may not apply to a pandemic.","Whether businesses will be covered depends on the wording of individual policies, said Ling Ong, vice president of the London Forum of Insurance Lawyers.","Travelers Companies Inc has pushed back against a lawsuit filed in Los Angeles by celebrity criminal defense lawyer Mark Geragos, who said his business had been hurt by shut-down orders.","“Insurers don’t collect premiums to cover losses that policies weren’t written to cover,” said Travelers chief executive officer Alan Schnitzer on Tuesday in an earnings call. Travelers’ standard coverage excludes viruses.",Chubb and Lloyd’s of London are among other insurers facing U.S. class action suits. The insurers declined to comment.,"However, some businesses have found they are covered - the British Columbia Dental Association’s members can claim under Aviva’s pandemic policy, it said this week.","Insurers’ protests may be futile. Eight U.S. states have introduced legislation which would require insurers to pay claims, mainly to small businesses, despite exclusions. Many of the bills would let insurers seek reimbursement from the states.","Pennsylvania State Senator Vincent Hughes, a Democrat, said he introduced the bill after many small businesses told him that insurers wouldn’t pay their claims and government aid programs had ran out of money.","Insurers say such laws make retroactive changes to contracts, with global trade body the Institute of International Finance saying earlier this month in a letter to regulators that this could lead to “decreased availability of insurance, the withdrawal of insurers from certain markets and overall increases in the price of available coverage”.","In France, President Emmanuel Macron said last week that insurers “must be there” to help stabilise the economy.",French insurers have said they would put 3.2 billion euros ($3.47 billion) on the table including a 1.5 billion investment programme and donations to the government’s aid fund.

They stop only after receiving increasingly hefty payments.","The attacks happened less frequently in 2019, but the problem remains significant, cybersecurity experts said.","“Ransomware is more sophisticated and dangerous than we saw in the past,” said Adam Kujawa, director of Malwarebytes Labs.","There were 6% fewer ransomware incidents in 2019 versus the prior year, according to Malwarebytes. However, attacks are now designed to spur deeper and more lasting technological problems, with hackers demanding bigger sums.","The average ransom of $41,198 during the 2019 third quarter more than tripled from the first quarter, according to Coveware, which helps negotiate and facilitate the payments.","Ransoms are becoming disproportionate to the size of targets, said Kelly Castriotta, Allianz SE ALVG.DE North American head of product development for financial lines. Hackers frequently pursue mid-size companies and other organizations that are less technologically adept, but also have less revenue to cover big ransoms.","“You’d expect a ransomware demand that you can pay,” Castriotta said.",The U.S. rate increases underscore broader global ransomware problems from which no company is immune.,"Ransomware recently crippled foreign-exchange firm Travelex Ltd’s [TRVLXP.UL] systems for weeks, leaving staff to serve customers with pens and paper.

The hackers have grown more sophisticated during the past year, cybersecurity experts say, shifting from individuals and mom-and-pop operations to larger companies that can afford bigger ransoms.","The effort, known in the cybersecurity industry as “big game hunting,” has been paying off for hackers. It has also been hurting insurers that provide cyber coverage for victims, which are often mid-sized companies desperate to get their systems restored and running quickly.","“They’re large enough to be worth extorting but not large enough to have sufficient network protections to defeat the ransomware,” said Brad Gow, global cyber product leader for insurer Sompo International 8630.T.","Sompo has been fielding a spate of claims related to a ransomware strain known as “Ryuk,” Gow said. He described the victims as companies with annual revenue between $500 million and $1 billion.",The number of attacks and size of ransom demands have been soaring.,"Businesses detected 365% more ransomware attacks in the second quarter than they did a year earlier, according to Malwarebytes, which sells cybersecurity software. The average ransom nearly tripled, to $36,295, from $12,762 between the first and second quarters of this year, according to Coveware, a firm that helps negotiate and facilitate cyber-ransom payments.","Criminals who dispatched the Ryuk strain have demanded as much as $5 million in bitcoin, the Federal Bureau of Investigation said in May.","“We’ve seen an unprecedented amount of ransomware attacks in 2019,” said Eireann Leverett, a senior risk researcher at the University of Cambridge Centre for Risk Studies. The size of losses for those attacks poses a serious risk to the business, Leverett said.","Companies that have cyber insurance are often covered for a variety of expenses. They include: data recovery, legal liabilities for exposing sensitive customer information, negotiators fluent in hackers’ native languages and the ultimate ransom payments.","Cyber experts say the criminals launching ransomware against companies are organized gangs in Russia and eastern Europe, or hackers sponsored by foreign governments. Insurers sometimes have restrictions in their policies to avoid covering attacks by nations, but it can be difficult to know for sure what type of criminal is launching an attack.",Insurers interviewed by Reuters said ransomware attacks are accelerating but declined to say how much they have paid in total claims.,"Lloyd’s of London insurer Beazley BEZG.L expects to handle double-to-triple the number of ransomware incidents in 2019 as it did last year, including at least another 800 claims by year-end, according to Katherine Keefe, Beazley's global head of breach response services.","Ransomware incidents during the third quarter increased 37% over the prior year quarter, Beazley said.","Similarly, Chubb Ltd CB.BN had already responded to the same number of ransomware events by June of this year as it did for all of 2018, said Michael Tanenbaum, its head of cyber for North America.","The average Ryuk ransomware attack claim from large companies is roughly $2 million, said Wade Chmielinski, a cyber consultant for commercial property insurer FM Global. Claims from smaller companies are typically between $150,000 and $250,000. FM Global does not pay for ransoms, he said.",One prominent attack in March against Norwegian aluminum maker Norsk Hydro NHY.OL turned out to be a lot more expensive.,"Norsk Hydro is among the few public examples available of ransomware striking a business, because publicizing such events can invite more attacks, experts said.","After its systems were paralyzed by the LockerGoga strain of ransomware, Hydro experienced $60.1 million to $71.1 million (550 million to 650 million Norwegian crowns) in related losses during the first half of 2019, the company said in a filing on Wednesday.","In March, Norsk Hydro identified American International Group Inc AIG.N as its lead cyber insurer. An AIG spokesman declined comment.","Norsk received a $3.6 million (33 million Norwegian crowns) insurance payout during the quarter and will report additional payouts when “deemed virtually certain,” the company said on Wednesday.","Global insurers collected $7 billion to $8 billion in cyber-insurance premiums during 2018, up about 13% from 2017, according to ratings agency AM Best.","But insurers are grappling with pricing as ransomware attacks become more common. Many of those attacks occur in the dark, making their frequency hard to know or how severe losses are. Although a simple ransom payment is often the cheapest, easiest solution, it also emboldens hackers, said Robert Hudock, a lawyer in Washington who advises clients on dealing with cyber attacks.","“It’s going to be a hard problem to solve,” he said, “if people keep paying the ransoms and the systems keep getting compromised.”",GRAPHIC: Common industries targeted by ransomware -

It exited some coal projects, on the heels of rival Rio Tinto RIO.L.","Large banks have begun disclosing their carbon exposures while setting targets for clean lending, while insurers including Chubb CB.BNCB.N and Suncorp SUN.AX, have moved away from coverage for new coal projects.",Top U.S. retailer Walmart WMT.N said this month it would stop selling ammunition for handguns in all its stores across the country and Australia's Woolworths WOW.AX became the first supermarket chain in the world to issue a certified climate bond this year.,"Despite a blitz of such corporate announcements, fund managers are constantly trying to differentiate between genuine ESG and spin by looking for deeper disclosures from the companies they screen, in areas such as gender pay gap and relationship with employees and suppliers.","But not all companies publish data on ESG impact yet, and analyzing data from those that do is also challenging. “Data isn’t always readily available, and not all investors have access to advanced analytical tools or various ESG data sets,” said Jessica Huang, head of Americas and APAC platform for Blackrock Sustainable Investing. “Investors often rely too much on historical data, which may not provide an accurate prediction of future trends.”",Some investment managers use so-called ESG ratings provided by firms such as Fitch Ratings.,"One MSCI study found that companies with higher average ESG ratings had lower risks, greater profitability and higher dividend yields. Yet, those ESG scores are based on the levels of disclosure by a company, not an actual assessment of practices.","Worryingly, a comparison of FTSE and MSCI ESG scores has hardly any correlation, said Mike Lubrano, managing director for corporate governance & sustainability at Cartica Management.","Variations in the components and weightings of the underlying metrics used by different index providers also generate widely divergent scores, he noted.","Despite the challenges of measuring ESG performance, investments in the stream are rising. Investors believe that if companies do well on ESG metrics, such focus will make their businesses more sustainable in the long term.","Indeed, an analysis of the top 500 companies in Asia, based on ESG metrics, shows their average returns outperformed the broader MSCI Asia Pacific index .MIAPJ0000PUS each time in the last 10 years.",(GRAPHIC: Asian ESG leaders' price performance - tmsnrt.rs/2Adko9m),"Data from Lipper showed assets under management of ethical, water and alternative energy funds in Asia climbed 16% to $28.5 billion in the first half of 2019 from a year ago.","In debt markets, climate bond issuances surpassed $150 billion this year though still a far cry from the $1 trillion goal for 2020, according to Climate Bonds Initiative.","The increased momentum has meant that banks are engaging more actively with their corporate clients while shareholders are rallying behind green groups demanding companies cut emissions, lift governance and improve social responsibilities.","So called responsible investors also shun industries that negatively affect society, including companies that produce or invest in alcohol, tobacco, gambling and guns.","Such activism prompted Australian supermarket giant Woolworths WOW.AX to finally agree, after years of engagement with investors, to offload its profitable pub and liquor business in July.","“Poker machines are horrible things but they are very profitable,” said Bruce Smith, another portfolio manager at Alphinity. “Once they get rid of that business, Woolworths will become a possible investment for us.”","Woolworths did not specifically comment on its decision, saying only that the move would help it simplify its structure and focus on the retail business."

But forest fires that have torched nearby land in recent years left him concerned.","So Gendelman, who runs an insurance brokerage, tapped into a program that American International Group Inc AIG.N offers to help design luxury properties in ways that mitigate disaster risk. A risk specialist made sure his home had a lightning-repellant system, cisterns to hold water run-off and ceramic shingles that look like wood. Just in case a blaze does break out, his driveway was designed to accommodate a fire truck's maneuvers.","“It’s a very high-end home and we’re dealing with very good contractors,” Gendelman said. “But (the AIG program) brought them systems they never used and resources they never heard of.”","Fires, floods, hurricanes and other catastrophes have cost U.S. insurers more than $170 billion in property losses since 2016, according to Property Claim Services (PCS), part of Verisk Analytics Inc VRSK.O, and the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis.","Few actuaries expect the trend to ease as climate change accelerates, and the swell of claims has prompted some insurers to get involved in the design process for lavish residential properties.","Insurers and industry groups said they do not track data on the service, which is still a tiny part of the property-casualty insurance industry. But executives, real-estate developers and brokers, builders and analysts who spoke to Reuters said they believe it will only expand.","""People don't naturally think of insurance as the first place to go,"" said Jennifer Naughton, head of North American personal insurance risk consulting services at Chubb Ltd CB.BN. ""But an insurance company can give you an advantage of the loss potential and might save you the pain of loss in the future.""","Chubb’s risk managers make sure homeowners who request the service have water storage on the property to supplement the local fire department’s resources, and recommend devices that allow emergency workers to open electronic entry gates, among other measures.","The trend is not entirely new: PURE Insurance has offered the service since its founding in 2007, and others have quietly made risk specialists available to customers who are designing a home and know to ask for the service. But it is now picking up steam as a stand-alone business at some major property-casualty insurers, as more clients worry about extreme weather.","AIG started marketing its service as “Smart Build” in 2015. Initially, only residential construction projects that cost more than $5 million were eligible, but AIG lowered the threshold to $1 million two years later.","AIG would not say how many homes it has helped design in total, but a spokesman said there were 20% more projects enrolled during the first six months of 2019 than in the prior-year period.","Cincinnati Insurance Companies joined the fray more recently, as did Vault, a high net-worth insurer launched in 2017 by a group of former AIG executives. W.R. Berkley Corp is also looking to offer the service as it ramps up business with wealthy clientele.","The home design process typically begins with an insurance risk specialist scoping out a site to assess possible dangers. For instance, if there is a high water table underground or a nearby body of water, they may suggest elevating the home or choosing another place to build to avoid the risk of flooding.","Ken Vona, who heads KVC Builders LLC and frequently teams up with PURE, recalled a couple who decided against a location because the house would have to be raised some 18 feet (5.5 m)off the ground to guard against flood risk.","“A perfect example of ‘bad piece of property, nice view,’” he said.","Once a site is selected, specialists review architectural plans, making sure designs are resistant to water and fire damage, among other risks. They scrutinize plumbing layouts, help design hurricane-proof storage rooms to protect valuables, vet the adequacy of sprinkler systems, measure driveway entrances and make sure there is a hydrant nearby.","Cameron Strothman, a senior risk manager for AIG Private Client Group, said he once had to figure out how to protect a site that was four miles away from the nearest hydrant. He liaised with the local fire department and advised the client to install a 30,000-gallon tank under the driveway so that fire trucks could tap a private water source instead. It cost $35,000.","Risk specialists’ suggestions generally represent 10 to 15% of total building costs, insurance experts said.","Some of the features are things homebuilders would likely install anyway, like a sophisticated fire alarm or sprinkler system, or measures required by building codes. Others cost very little money but can prevent extremely expensive damage. For instance, there is a $100 sensor that shuts off water systems after detecting a leak.","Adding these features at the time of construction is also cheaper than doing so once the home is built, risk experts said. A protective storage room for fine art may run less than $100,000 if designed into the plans compared to millions of dollars later, said Steve Bitterman, Vault’s chief risk services officer.","Gendelman would not disclose the costs associated with building or protecting his home, but said AIG did not charge him for the advice.","“Providing this service free is smart for everyone,” he said. “They help me with ideas and they get a loyal client.”"

New laws may allow you a path to significant financial compensation.”","However, victims and advocates often say the money is secondary, and many sue to expose perpetrators, hold organizations accountable and to further the healing process.","Some organizations, including the Boy Scouts of America, are acknowledging abuse, apologizing and reporting the accused to law enforcement authorities.","Others have offered compensation. The Archdiocese of New York has paid $65 million to 325 people since 2017. Only one person rejected an offer, according to the archdiocese.",Those who accept an offer give up their right to sue. Some victim advocates said compensation programs kept stories of abuse secret.,"“I think the potential is huge for all kinds of things coming to the surface like we’re seeing with Epstein,” said victims’ attorney James Marsh, referring to the criminal sex trafficking charges against the once politically connected American financier Jeffrey Epstein. He pleaded not guilty and is jailed pending trial.",Victims’ lawyers said insurance policies will provide a significant amount of money. The Archdiocese of New York and the Boy Scouts of America have already become embroiled in disputes over insurance coverage.,The Travelers Cos TRV.N and Chubb Ltd CB.BN have said they are planning to bolster reserves related to laws reviving old abuse claims.,"Coordinating scores of lawsuits against an organization could also be difficult, although few New York cases are expected to go to trial.","Many lawyers said they expect organizations to file for bankruptcy, which would stop the litigation and create one forum where all the claims can be settled at once.","“Bankruptcy is the way to go,” said lawyer Tim Kosnoff, who specializes in cases against the Boy Scouts. “Most clients come out of it pretty satisfied.”"

Lloyd’s insures everything from hurricane damage to soccer stars’ legs, but high levels of insured losses from natural catastrophes triggered the two years of poor results.","While Lloyd’s outlined plans last month to set up electronic platforms as soon as next year, its intricate structure involving 99 underwriting syndicate members and hundreds of brokers makes change difficult.","Neal said his strategy includes shifting Lloyd’s geographic focus, including concentrating on developed markets with strong growth potential such as the United States. The United States and Canada accounted for 51% of Lloyd’s business last year.","Lloyd’s kicked off its U.S. strategy during a dinner on Tuesday for top insurance and brokerage executives in New York’s new World Trade Center building, a site that following the destruction of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks was rebuilt partly with $8 billion in claims payments from the Lloyd’s marketplace, its chairman, Bruce Carnegie-Brown, said.","“We are talking to all of the big insurers here...to say, How do you feel about the marketplace and what opportunities can we help you realize in the Lloyd’s marketplace?” Neal said, adding that both AIG and Chubb are interested in the conversation.","Lloyd’s has already been talking to AIG, including CEO Brian Duperreault and Peter Zaffino, CEO of AIG’s General Insurance business, about the possibility of selling more products through the marketplace, Neal said.","AIG acquired Bermuda reinsurer Validus in 2018, partly because of its Talbot unit, a Lloyd’s of London syndicate, Duperreault said at the time.","“Our impression from any conversations with (Duperreault) and Zaffino is that they’d love to grow their business at Lloyd’s,” Neal said.",Neal said his London-based colleagues were surprised when he proposed the United States as a priority because they believed emerging economies had more growth potential.,"He sees growth potential in several U.S. areas, including specialty insurance, which covers unique risks such as damage to a company’s reputation, or liability for a merger deal that goes sour. “Professional lines” insurance, which includes liability coverage for corporate directors and officers, is another possible growth area, Neal said.","The global commercial, corporate, specialty insurance and reinsurance business is worth $750 billion, and half of those premiums are in the United States, Neal said.","“So literally, one dollar in two of everything that would interest Lloyd’s underwriters is here,” he said."

Ruth Smith, who used a walker, fell down two concrete steps in the theater and died about six weeks later. Now Smith’s estate is suing Sunrise, saying that aides did not properly watch her.","As the U.S. society ages, senior living communities are on the rise. So are claims and lawsuits against them. And when they lose, it is usually down to insurers to pay up.","""It's a tremendous opportunity that has pretty specific challenges,"" said Brendan Gallagher, who heads the senior care business at insurance broker Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. AJG.N","Some senior living facilities could see insurance rate hikes in 2019 as high as 30 percent, according to insurance broker Willis Towers Watson. WLTW.O","Fewer insurers are offering coverage today than they were five years ago and some Lloyd’s of London members stopped writing the coverage during the past year, said John Atkinson, managing partner at Willis.","Some insurers are dropping coverage of those communities entirely while others are avoiding litigious locations such as Kentucky, Illinois and Florida, said insurers and brokers.","While the pullback threatens to raise costs for families, other insurers are expanding, betting on the industry’s strong growth prospects.","The number of people living in U.S. residential care facilities has grown by over 10 percent to 812,000 between 2010 and 2016, according to the most recent data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.","As the industry gears up for the arrival of the greying 74-million baby boom generation, senior living facilities have grown even faster. The number of rooms in those centers has risen up by a fifth since 2013, according to the National Investment Center for Seniors Housing & Care (NIC), which collects data for the 99 largest U.S. metro areas.","While aging is a global phenomenon and the U.S. society is relatively younger than those in Europe and north Asia, its greater dependence on senior centers confronts it with challenges other nations may yet have to grapple with.","More so than previous U.S. generations, today’s elderly often live far away from their children. In Europe, seniors tend to live much closer to their relatives or in communities that provide generous government services for the elderly. In many Asian and African communities, multiple generations commonly live together.","Not only do more people move into retirement communities, but they tend to do it later than they used to, resulting in more frequent and severe injuries, insurance professionals say.","""People are living longer and they are more frail,"" said Gloria Holland, vice president of finance at Capital Senior Living Corp CSU.N, a Dallas-based company that runs 129 communities across the country.","A spokeswoman for Sunrise Assisted Living, where Smith lived, said the company had policies and procedures in place to help promote resident safety. “Anytime we lose a member of our community we are deeply saddened,” she said.","Falls are the biggest risk. Allegations of falls account for nearly half of all assisted living claims that insurer CNA Financial Group CNA.N closed in 2016 and 2017, the company said. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2GzYrHM)","Another source of insurance claims are “memory care” centers, which cater to people with Alzheimer’s disease and other types of memory problems.","The nascent sector has grown 52 percent since 2013, according to NIC. A big issue there: residents who wander away.","Last year, the body of 77-year-old Audrey Penn was found in a ditch after she left a senior living community in Allentown, Pennsylvania. A lawsuit filed by her family settled for an undisclosed amount.","Capital Senior Living’s Holland said the average age of residents who moved to its facilities was between 78 and 80 when she joined the company in 2004 and has risen to between 82 to 84 by now. That makes individual claims more expensive to settle. The company anticipates a 5 percent rate increase when it renews its insurance in 2019, Holland said.","Higher rates and deductibles are more likely to affect smaller facilities, which may lack robust compliance programs for preventing accidents and other problems, insurers and brokers say. Smaller centers often ""struggle to keep up with changing regulations,"" said Caroline Clouser, who heads the healthcare industry practice at insurer Chubb Ltd. CB.N","Insurance premiums for senior facilities vary by state. Premiums for each assisted living apartment range from $150 to $600 annually, insurers and brokers say.","Insurance for those facilities makes up less than 1 percent of the $558 billion property and casualty insurers collected in net written premiums in 2017. Yet it is likely to grow as aging boomers fill up senior communities, industry insiders say.","Nationwide is among the companies that have been growing their senior living insurance business while being selective, said Jeremy Moore, senior living underwriting manager.","“You have to understand what the exposures are and the controls in place,” he said.","Nationwide has a team of former senior living executives and administrators who visit communities and look at everything from building maintenance to evacuation procedures, Moore said.","Wisconsin-based Church Mutual Insurance Company, which writes coverage for the industry in 49 states, is planning to expand into Florida, the remaining state, in 2019, according to Jim Ketterson, who heads the insurer’s senior living practice.",Brokers are also working to help senior living communities better manage their risk. Willis recently launched a program to help facilities learn how to more safely lift residents.,"Willis also runs a webinar on active shooter events, including tips such using beds to block doors that do not lock, a common feature in memory care facilities.","Senior living companies also keep reviewing their facilities and procedures, they say. For example, Capital Senior Living is gradually replacing carpet flooring with laminate, which is less of a trip hazard, Holland said. It is also considering a technology that can help track residents’ movements to determine if they are at risk of a fall."

Prices vary based on the coverage, but they are intended for high net-worth families, so expect sticker shock. Along with AIG’s CyberEdge, Chubb Ltd just launched a cyber protection extension to its Masterpiece homeowner policy.","These policies cover for losses up to $250,0000, if, for instance, you need to replace the entire smart lighting system in your house because it has been hacked. The policies also offer ongoing white-glove consulting services to shore up cyber-defenses and also clean up after any incidents.","If these policies work for upper-income families, lower-priced coverage will follow, says independent security expert Robert Siciliano.","“They’re testing the waters, and they’ll see if it’ll be worth it to them to provide it to the masses,” said Siciliano, chief executive of IDTheftSecurity.com.","So far, most of AIG’s CyberEdge clients are asking questions about best safety practices.","“The goal is to provide a lot of consultation up front, and then avoid most of the issues,” said Hourihan.","Chubb’s Masterpiece is front-loading its policies with a lot of prevention, including a special wi-fi router from cyber-security firm Symantec Corp’s Norton, said Mike Tanenbaum, executive vice-president of Chubb’s North American cyber practice.","Without getting an expensive insurance policy, there are steps you can take to limit risk.","Change the locks, so to speak, said Mary Qualls of Florida-based Vault Insurance, catering to high net-worth homeowners. That can involve restarting your router to break any ongoing connection a hacker has into your network and also changing all your passwords.",Siciliano does not understand why everyone does not use a password management program.,"“That is pure laziness,” Siciliano said.","With no universal reporting, it is hard to get a good grasp on cyber security problems and figure out a way to solve them. Eva Velasquez, president of the Identity Theft Resource Center (idtheftcenter.org), said that if more people reported hacking incidents it would help.","Recent data from the Federal Trade Commission found that millennials are reporting fraud a lot more often than other groups, with an average loss around $200, Velasquez said. Seniors reported less, but their average loss is $1,200.","“As you have more resources, your trigger of ‘is that painful enough to report?’ changes. The thieves know that,” said Velasquez.",The result: Hackers keep thefts low enough to fly under the radar and continue to operate with impunity.,"Velasquez, whose organization offers free services for victims of identify theft, said that insurance could be worth it for individuals if they do a cost-benefit analysis.","“Do your homework, make sure it is legit, and know what’s covered,” Velasquez said. “If it brings you peace of mind, that can be of value. At the same time, just because you have insurance, you can’t abdicate responsibility.”"

Alberto forced the evacuation of oil workers in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico on Friday.","In 2017, the hurricane season, which typically runs from June to November, caused more than $250 billion worth of damage in the United States.

In November, the home improvement retailer raised its 2017 profit and sales forecasts in response to increased demand for emergency and rebuilding supplies.","For several hotel operators, the increased demand from guests displaced by hurricanes outweighed the damage the storms wrought on their properties in affected areas.","From June 1 to Dec. 1, shares of Hyatt Hotels Corp H.N jumped 25.8 percent, while La Quinta Holdings Inc LQ.N climbed 24.5 percent. Shares of Marriott International Inc MAR.O, Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc HLT.N and Choice Hotels International Inc CHH.N rose between 15.9 percent and 18.9 percent.","During the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, shares of Kinder Morgan Inc KMI.N, which shut down several of its pipelines and gas facilities as Hurricane Harvey approached, fell 8.3 percent.","Shares of oilfield services companies also slumped. Shares of Baker Hughes BHGE.N, owned by General Electric Co GE.N, dropped 20.6 percent between June 1 and December 1. Halliburton Co HAL.N shares fell 5.3 percent, and Schlumberger NV SLB.N shares declined 7.2 percent.","Florida home insurers' shares slumped on Sept. 7 as investors anticipated heavy losses from Hurricane Irma.
