Production now is about 11 million barrels per day (bpd), down sharply from the record of nearly 13 million bpd hit in late 2019.","The share of drilling activity by Exxon and Chevron in the Permian Basin oil field in Texas and New Mexico dropped to less than 5% this month from 28% last spring, according to data from Rystad Energy.","""We essentially hit a pause button,"" said Chevron Chief Financial Officer Pierre Breber. ""When the world was oversupplied we didn't see the virtue in putting more capital to add barrels.""

Chevron expects to produce around 1 million barrels daily by 2025 and Exxon 700,000 bpd by 2025, the companies said at investor days this month.","Chevron will increase Permian spending from $2 billion now to pre-Covid levels of $4 billion annually “over the course of the next several years,” Breber said, but the company will not increase drilling in the Permian this year. It is currently running about five rigs in the Permian with two completion crews, down from just under 20 a year ago.","“Although prices are up and underlying fundamentals are strengthening and recovering, we’re not out of the woods yet,” Breber said. “So this year we’re going to stick with our budget.”","Exxon Chief Executive Darren Woods recently said the company would use additional profits to reduce debt instead of funding more drilling. Exxon had seven Permian rigs drilling at the start of March and said it expects to keep seven to 10 at work this year, down sharply from 60 at this time last year.","Both companies are likely to increase Permian spending next year, said Stewart Glickman, energy equity analyst at CFRA Research.

Producers are also completing backlogs of unfinished wells.","However, output is unlikely to increase dramatically, due to the swift decline rates for shale wells.","“We would need three months of oil prices sustained at current levels followed by six months of drilling activity before production begins to climb higher on a sustained basis,” said Peter McNally at Third Bridge.","Exxon and Chevron are not the only producers keeping spending down. Many shale companies have hedged a majority of expected 2021 oil production at an average price below $45 a barrel, well below current market prices, Enverus' Andy McConn said. The hedges reduce exposure to the recent increase in oil prices, discouraging near-term growth. (Graphic: Permian oil production stalls, )"

Other partners include Chevron with 28.26%, Thai PTTEP with 25.5% and MOGE with 15%.","Located off Myanmar’s southwest coast in the Gulf of Martaban, the Yadana fields primarily produce gas for delivery to power plants in Thailand.","The fields also supply the domestic market via an offshore pipeline built and operated by MOGE, according to Total.","In 2019, Total produced 1.3 billion cubic metres of gas in Myanmar, equivalent to 16,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed) - a relatively small amount representing 0.5 % of Total’s overall output of 3 million boed.","Over the past decade, the share of Total production from the fields fluctuated between 13,000-21,000 boed.","Even though volumes are modest, they are important for Myanmar.","In 2019, Total paid $229.6 million to Myanmar, including $178.6 million to MOGE for produced and sold gas and $51 million in taxes to the ministry of finance.","According to Total reports, between 2015-2019 the company paid a total of $786.5 million over five years, including $619.9 million to MOGE and $166.6 million to the ministry of finance.","A consortium led by Total also won the rights to develop a terminal to import liquefied natural gas into an offshore terminal at Kanbauk, a 1,230 MW power plant and the supply of electricity to Yangon, to start up in 2023.","Total, which employed 247 people in Myanmar in 2019, has said it was monitoring events and possible sanctions closely and was currently focusing on the safety of its workers. It said new projects in Myanmar were not a priority.","In 2002, four refugees from Myanmar filed a lawsuit against Total in Belgium.","The four refugees also sued Total’s chief at the time, Thierry Desmarest, for complicity in the torture and forced labour of workers who were building a pipeline from Yadana.",Total has denied funding the military but has said the military paid soldiers to protect installations and workers. Total has repeatedly said Yadana was exempt from sanctions and it was acting as a positively engaged actor in the country.,The case was closed in 2008 after several years of deliberations over whether the plaintiffs had the standing to bring the lawsuit because they were not Belgian citizens.,"The United States’ second-biggest energy company Chevron is a partner of Total in Yadana with a 28.3% stake. Its share of production stood at 15,000 boed in 2019, also just a fraction of its global output of 3 million boed.",Chevron says its deal with Myanmar on Yadana expires in 2028.

According to EITI data, Chevron paid around $50 million to Myanmar between 2014 and 2018.","According to EITI’s reports, payments to MOGE are with oil and gas in kind.","According to Reuters calculations, based on figures disclosed by Total for Yadana payments and Chevron’s share in Yadana, Chevron’s payments to MOGE could be around $560 million between 2015 and 2019.","Thailand’s PTT Exploration and Production, the upstream arm of state firm PTT, is a participant in all three major functioning projects in Myanmar. Thailand imports some 1,400 million cubic feet per day (mcfd) of gas, half of which comes from Myanmar. Since the military coup, PTTEP has said operations remain normal.","In Yadana, PTTEP has been a partner of Total, Chevron and MOGE since 1992. According to Reuters calculations, based on figures disclosed by Total and PTTEP’s share in Yadana, PTTEP payments should have amounted to close to $640 million between 2015-2019, including around $500 million to MOGE.","PTTEP also has a 19.3% stake in the Yetagun project (Block M12, M13 and M14) which has been producing gas since 2000. Its partners in the project are Malaysia’s Petronas with 40.91 %, Japan’s Nippon Oil with 19.32% and MOGE with 20.45%.","PTTEP also has an 80% interest in the Zawtika project (M9), which has been producing gas since 2003.

In the fantasy M&A game, Exxon could in theory buy Chevron at a premium, mostly for stock. But Darren Woods may not be investors’ preferred leader for the combined group. Chevron buying Exxon might bring the right chief executive, with Mike Wirth in charge, but a deal that way around could call for too much leverage. There’s a third, way, too: a $400 billion merger of equals.","Exxon is the bigger of the two companies, with a market capitalization of over $210 billion, more than 20% larger than Chevron’s. If it were to offer a 20% premium for its rival, Woods’ Texas-based company could fund the purchase almost entirely with shares and still leave its own shareholders with just over 50% of the combined company, according to a new Breakingviews calculator. And because Chevron has much less debt – and almost as much EBITDA forecast for 2021, according to Refinitiv data – Exxon could close the deal looking less leveraged than it is now.","The trouble is that Chevron’s Wirth has proved a better operator, relatively speaking. Since taking the helm in February 2018, shares are off by just over 25% while Exxon’s stock is down by more than 40%. He has also earned the reputation of being a prudent dealmaker, having walked away from buying Anadarko Petroleum at what was a market high.","Picking the right boss is key to a successful merger. If either company offers a meaningful premium for the other, even cutting 5% of combined operating costs, more than $3 billion a year, wouldn’t compensate, once taxed and capitalized. The chief executive of the new fossil-fuel giant would have to do more with less capital expenditure, too.","But Chevron buying Exxon is a stretch. Wirth would have to issue more than $80 billion of debt so that current shareholders could maintain a majority stake. That would jack up the debt-to-EBITDA ratio at Chexxon to nearly 3 times, more than twice the current level.","A merger of equals is the dream answer, ignoring real-world hurdles like antitrust concerns. The market values of the two companies have been converging. Even now they are close enough, at around 55-45, to argue for an equal union. Then it’s a question of sharing out the chief executive and chairman roles, board seats, headquarter locations, and other sensitive goodies. The closer the two get in size, the better the deal looks.",Run the numbers tmsnrt.rs/3q6LtDo

But the ad agencies behind the campaigns have largely escaped scrutiny.,"That’s changing, as the issue of climate change shoots up the global agenda. Climate activists and some ad industry figures are calling on agencies to declare or dump their Big Oil clients.","Recent lawsuits by four U.S. states, the District of Columbia and a city allege “greenwashing” by oil companies, accusing them of making “misleading and deceptive” claims. The suits don’t name the ad agencies as defendants, but do single out at least 15 campaigns. As a result, the companies could face embarrassment or become embroiled in the litigation.","Sean Corey, a Chevron spokesman, said such lawsuits are “meritless” and “serve only to divert attention and resources away from the collaborative, international efforts that are critical to developing a meaningful solution to climate change.”","Pressure has been building against oil and gas companies in recent years to address dangerously rising global temperatures. The companies, which rank among the world’s worst polluters, have been targeted by protests outside their offices and seen sponsorship deals with museums, art galleries and others canceled in the United States and Europe.","A prominent climate protest group, Extinction Rebellion, last year unfurled a banner reading “TELL THE TRUTH” outside the advertising industry’s top awards ceremony in Cannes, France. Activists in the Netherlands and other European countries are campaigning for a tobacco-style ban on fossil fuel advertising.","All these pressures will likely intensify after the January inauguration of U.S. President-elect Joe Biden, who has vowed to get tough on climate change.","Most major advertising companies with fossil fuel clients, and the U.S. ad industry’s leading trade group, declined to comment for this story or did not respond to requests for comment. However, in a statement, WPP Plc, the world’s largest advertising and public relations holding company, defended its practices.","“WPP recognises the importance of its role in addressing climate change by applying rigorous standards to the content we produce and helping clients to accelerate the world’s transition to a lower-carbon economy,” the agency said. A spokeswoman also said the company “will not undertake work which is intended or designed to mislead.”","WPP did not handle the ad featuring Steve, formally known as “We Agree.” That ad is part of a global campaign created in 2010 by New York-based agency Dentsu McGarryBowen LLC. Jennifer Ferguson, a spokeswoman for McGarryBowen’s holding company, Dentsu Group Inc, declined to comment.",‘A SEA CHANGE’,"Delaware, along with Connecticut, Massachusetts, Minnesota, the District of Columbia and the city of Hoboken, New Jersey, are suing key players in the oil industry for violating consumer protection laws with the help of “greenwashing” ad campaigns.","The new scrutiny of advertising campaigns raises the prospect that ad agencies could see their names dragged into litigation along with their oil company clients, said Karen Sokol, an environmental law professor at Loyola University New Orleans.",Sokol said that similar lawsuits against the tobacco industry brought to light information on the role of advertisers and PR companies in deceiving the public about the dangers of smoking.,"In 1997, R.J. Reynolds tobacco company agreed to pay $10 million to settle a lawsuit over a campaign for its Camel brand, which was accused of targeting children. The “Joe Camel” campaign was executed by large advertising firms that also were sued.","Ultimately, Sokol said, details about advertising and marketing practices that emerged during litigation against the tobacco industry contributed to the companies’ decision in the late 1990s to pay billions of dollars annually in a massive settlement with the vast majority of U.S. states and territories.","“There was a sea change in how we viewed tobacco products after we learned about that industry’s disinformation,” she said. “We’re on the cusp of that with climate.”","Others predict that Big Oil’s message makers will likely avoid costly courtroom verdicts. Douglas Kysar, a professor at Yale Law School who specializes in climate change, among other things, said it was unlikely that ad firms would be held liable for misleading communications by fossil fuel companies. That’s because the primary duty of those firms is to their clients, the companies, and not to the public, he said.","However, he added, given the “existential stakes” of climate change, advertisers likely won’t escape being sued in the first place. “I fully expect that advertising/PR firms, bankers, insurers, accountants, lawyers, and other professionals that support fossil fuel companies, will increasingly find themselves targeted by lawsuits and pressure campaigns.”",‘CREATIVITY HAS CONSEQUENCES’,"The picture is different in Europe, where regulators have taken action against a number of ad campaigns by oil companies.","In 2019, for instance, the UK advertising watchdog upheld a complaint against an ad by Norwegian energy giant Equinor ASA that suggested gas was a “low carbon” energy source. In January, Italy’s competition authority slapped state-backed energy giant Eni SpA with a €5 million ($6.10 million) fine for ads claiming that its diesel was “green” and helped the environment.","In the United States, ad agencies face a more immediate worry.","Several current and former ad executives and industry experts say advertisers for fossil fuel companies face a big challenge in appealing to young people, who polls show are far more concerned about global warming than their elders. In addition, some say, agencies with oil industry clients face a struggle to recruit talented young people with climate concerns.","Ad agency staff “are forced to treat all clients as equal,” said Solitaire Townsend, co-founder of Futerra, a mid-sized advertising firm based in London. “But for the best young talent that simply isn’t good enough anymore. They know that creativity has consequences, so our industry cannot be neutral.”","Futerra has set up an initiative in which agencies voluntarily declare what proportion of their revenue comes from so-called “high-carbon” clients, including not just Big Oil but also the aviation, automobile, concrete and plastics industries.","Futerra disclosed in 2019 that 1% of its revenue was generated by clients involved in plastics or aviation, but otherwise had no high-carbon clients.","Her firm and 244 small to mid-size agencies have signed on to the initiative, she said.","The American Petroleum Institute, the oil industry trade group, criticized the spate of recent efforts to get advertising firms to ditch the oil and gas industry, saying that they were “divisive” and “unfounded.”","“We are focused on being part of the solution, and we welcome debate on the best ways to innovate for a cleaner, reliable and affordable energy future,” said API spokeswoman Bethany Aronhalt.","Together with their subsidiaries, the Big Four advertising companies - WPP, Omnicom Group, Publicis Groupe and Interpublic Group of Companies (IPG) - handle the accounts of many major oil companies. The accounts provide much-needed income for an ad industry financially devastated by the coronavirus pandemic.",WPP and IPG told Reuters they would not disclose their client lists. Omnicom and Publicis didn’t respond to a request for comment.,‘THE CLARION CALL’,"Despite financial strains exacerbated by the pandemic, the oil industry’s spending on advertising and PR will continue, or perhaps rise, as it fights tougher climate-related regulations and shrinking social acceptance in many countries, ad industry experts told Reuters.","“Over the past thirty years, the major oil companies have ramped up their PR activities whenever it appears that the government is considering regulation of their activities,” said Bob Brulle, Visiting Professor of Environment and Society at Brown University in Rhode Island. “It is quite predictable that this will occur as the Biden administration starts acting to control carbon emissions.”",The suits by Delaware and Hoboken cite four WPP campaigns for fossil fuel companies as “misleading” or “greenwashing.”,"WPP, which is not named as a defendant, declined to comment on the lawsuits.","WPP’s website publishes an emphatic statement in favor of addressing climate change by its subsidiary, Ogilvy Consulting. “As industry leaders, we must be the clarion call,” said the article. “We must act now.”","Those actions included helping its clients from the energy sector “accelerate the world’s transition to a lower-carbon economy,” WPP told Reuters.","Christine Arena, CEO of Generous, an ad agency in San Francisco, said big agencies were positioning themselves as saviors of the climate while representing companies accused of wrecking it. In 2015, Arena was one of four executives who left a large U.S. public relations firm to protest its representation of oil companies.","“We’re at the point where you can no longer play both sides credibly or with impunity,” she said.",($1 = 0.8193 euros)

Earlier this week, Exxon said it would cut its workforce by about 15% but kept its fourth-quarter dividend at 87 cents a share, making 2020 the first year since 1982 that it has not raised its shareholder payout.","“It is significant that Exxon is explicitly guiding to maintaining the dividend having reduced capex and potentially adding more divestments,” said Anish Kapadia, director of energy at London-based Palissy Advisors.","Exxon said its North American dry gas assets, worth roughly $25 billion to $30 billion, could be written down if the company decides those holdings are not part of its long-term investment plans.","Next year, the largest U.S. oil producer said capital spending would be between $16 billion to $19 billion, versus an adjusted plan to spend around $23 billion this year.","The company, once the most valuable in the United States by market capitalization, was this month surpassed in value by wind and solar provider NextEra.","In the top U.S. oil field, the Permian Basin shale field, Chevron expects output to dip to around 550,000 barrels of oil and gas per day, from 565,000 barrels per day this quarter, Breber said. It is likely to maintain that level until the global economy recovers.","Exxon’s Permian output was around 401,000 barrels per day in the third quarter and it said its costs there had dropped 20%."

That’s a fundamental shift,” Wirth told Reuters in an interview.","“There’s not a lot of capital investment required in the near term,” he said. “At a time when cash flow matters, that’s a very appealing attribute.”","The deal brings an alliance with Israel that has been smoothed by the narrowing of some historical rifts in the region, such as the establishment of formal ties between Israel and the United Arab Emirates in an agreement signed last month.","Wirth said Middle Eastern commercial and diplomatic relations “are becoming more codified and stronger, that’s a trend that we think augurs well for the region.”","Chevron also made a courtesy call about the Noble deal to officials in Saudi Arabia, a key partner in several Chevron oil projects and a nation with historically strained relations with Israel, according to a senior source at the U.S. company.","The Saudi government media communications office did not respond to a request for comment, while Chevron said it did not discuss details of meetings.",Yet the regional political and security risks that have deterred some companies in recent years still exist.,"Syria and Yemen are riven by wars, with uncertain consequences for a wider region where archrivals Saudi Arabia and Iran are waging a proxy battle.","Just this January, the U.S. killing of Iranian general Qassem Soleimani in Iraq - and a reprisal by Tehran - illustrated the instability of the Middle East and threatened to engulf it in conflict.","Despite such risks, Chevron - which at one point leap-frogged rival ExxonMobil this month to be the largest U.S. oil company by market value - is plowing ahead with efforts across the region.","The Leviathan field and others nearby have the potential to become major factors in regional fuel supplies. Chevron could send gas to a Egyptian liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant that could ship the fuel to Europe or Asia, Wirth said.","European and Asian nations have been moving toward gas, solar and wind, and away from coal and nuclear power.","“The reality is you need gas in tandem with renewables,” said Christopher Kalnin, CEO of Banpu Kalnin Ventures, which invests in U.S. shale gas. Asia in particular will remain dependent on imported gas, he said, because it complements solar and wind.","Global gas demand through 2025 is projected to rise 1.5% per year on average, largely on growing purchases by customers in China and India.","In contrast, oil consumption may have already peaked at last year’s 100 million barrel per day (bpd) level, forecasters say, and this year could sink to 91.7 million bpd, a seven-year low.","The Middle East produces a third of the world’s oil and one sixth of its natural gas, and has long drawn the interest of foreign oil companies. Chevron produces fewer barrels of oil and gas in the region than other majors, according to Rystad Energy data, but it is the only major to have had a continuous presence in Saudi Arabia for 70 years and has maintained good relations with governments in the region.","""Chevron is extremely good at what I would call crown jewel government relations, big assets in challenging countries,"" said Robin West, a board member of Spanish oil major Repsol SA REP.MC and head of Boston Consulting Group's Center for Energy Impact. ""They very quietly work away at things.""","The Noble deal fits Wirth’s effort to adapt to a low-cost energy world and expand in Qatar, Egypt and Iraq. It brought Chevron nearly 1 billion cubic feet of natural gas reserves, and ensures it remains among the world’s top 10 gas suppliers.","“The size of the opportunity was way beyond the capacity of a company like Noble,” said a former Chevron executive who declined to be identified because of ongoing relationships.","The purchase may help Chevron's bid for a stake in Qatar's LNG production expansion, where it is competing with Exxon, Shell and Total SA TOTF.PA, among others. Chevron also recently signed a preliminary agreement for oil exploration in southern Iraq.",Wirth cautioned that negotiations were ongoing: “There’s no certainty of outcome on either of those.”,"Wirth has, meanwhile, intensified his cost-cutting at home.","Chevron has slashed its spending in the top U.S. shale field by half, to around $2 billion this year. It had just four active drilling rigs in the Permian Basin as of September, down from 16 in March, according to consultancy Rystad Energy."

He noted the smaller scale of this deal - $5 billion versus the $33 billion Chevron had offered for Anadarko. He said other “prospective buyers would find it easier to replicate via other means.”","The acquisition will give Chevron a bigger presence in the shale patches of Colorado as well as the Permian Basin, the top U.S. shale field. Chevron has been expanding there, and was under pressure to show how it planned to expand output when existing Permian assets are depleted.","Last year’s bid for Anadarko was an attempt to boost Permian production, but Chevron instead pocketed a $1 billion break fee.","Since then, margins and drilling have been decimated by the coronavirus crisis. Prices have rebounded to around $40 a barrel from an average of around $20 in April, yet they remain depressed and have weighed on energy company valuations. Just seven months ago, Noble had a market capitalization of about $12 billion compared to $4.63 billion on Friday.","Shares of Noble closed up 5.4% to $10.18, after falling more than 60% this year through Friday’s close. Chevron fell 2.2% to $85.27.","The offer values Noble at $10.38 a share, a 7.5% premium to its Friday close. Including the company’s debt pile, the deal is worth roughly $13 billion.","Chevron is paying a “moderate premium” reflecting a cautious outlook for oil and gas deals, said Andrew Dittmar, senior M&A analyst at data provider Enverus.","Noble shareholders will own about 3% of the combined company, after the deal closes, expected in the fourth quarter.","The deal will help save about $300 million on an annual run-rate basis and add to free cash flow and earnings one year after closing, if global oil prices LCOc1 stay at $40, Chevron said.","It would add about 18% to Chevron’s proved reserves.

Chevron had already halted many of the activities Washington has now prohibited.","Seeking to increase pressure on Maduro, the U.S. Treasury Department late on Tuesday imposed tight new restrictions on Chevron’s joint ventures with Venezuelan state-run oil company PDVSA, which could pave the way for the California-based company’s departure, after operating in Venezuela for about 100 years.","The license prohibits Chevron or any American company from drilling, bartering or selling oil or petroleum products with the Maduro government as of Tuesday night, the U.S. official told reporters on a call.","Chevron’s assets “are mothballed and essentially it’s ... a de facto wind-down, which allows them to just ensure that their assets remain viable and that the Venezuelan people that work for them are able to continue getting paid during these dire times,” the official added.","The license gives Chevron until Dec. 1 to “wind down” operations in Venezuela, an OPEC member, but the license could be renewed at a later date, allowing the company to stay there longer.","A second senior U.S. official said the Chevron action, part of U.S. President Donald Trump’s “maximum pressure” strategy aimed at stifling trade in Venezuelan crude, “will further deprive access to financial lifelines” the Venezuelan leader depends on to keep his hold on power.","The Trump administration has waged a campaign of sanctions and diplomatic measures in an effort to oust Maduro, whose 2018 re-election was considered a sham by most Western countries.","Venezuela’s oil exports have dropped by one-third since the United States and dozens of other countries recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as the country’s legitimate interim president in January of last year. Even so, Maduro remains in power, backed by Venezuela’s military as well as Russia, China and Cuba.",Chevron said the new license permits the company to undertake limited maintenance of essential operations in the country.,"“We will continue to comply with applicable laws and regulations,” spokesman Ray Fohr said.",‘WHAT LITTLE WAS LEFT’,"Washington has ramped up sanctions on Venezuela’s key oil industry in recent months. Trump’s hardline approach has strong support in the Cuban-American community in south Florida, a key constituency in an important swing state as he seeks re-election in November.","Still, some U.S. officials have privately said Trump is frustrated over the failure of his Venezuela policy to unseat Maduro.","Chevron’s joint ventures with PDVSA accounted for 23% of Venezuela’s total output of just over 700,000 barrels per day as of late March, according to private estimates. Even before the new restrictions, the company canceled service contracts at its two largest joint ventures, which it attributed to falling crude prices.","“The collapse in prices made it practically irrelevant if Chevron was there or not,” said Francisco Monaldi, an energy economist at Rice University, saying that investing in oil production in Venezuela was not profitable at current prices. “It becomes more relevant in three or four months if oil prices recover.”","The Petropiar <C}RO7309543407> heavy crude upgrader - a Chevron-PDVSA joint venture key for turning Venezuela’s sludgy crude into exportable grades, was operating normally on Wednesday to produce some 90,000 barrels, said one person familiar with the plant’s operations.","The new restrictions also apply to oilfield services companies like Halliburton HAL.N and Schlumberger SLB.N, which have significantly scaled back activities in Venezuela but maintain a presence. The vast majority of their remaining contracts were with Chevron joint ventures, two industry sources said.","“This has dynamited what little was left of the national oil industry,” said one person close to a Western oil company in Venezuela. “If we don’t have contracts with Chevron, well, we don’t have contracts with anybody.",Halliburton declined to comment. Schlumberger said it was working with outside counsel “to interpret the new license and what this means for operations in Venezuela.”,"The U.S. Treasury recently blacklisted two trading units of Russian oil giant Rosneft ROSN.MM, for conducting business with PDVSA. Rosneft had accused Washington of double standards for allowing U.S. companies to continue working in Venezuela.","Rosneft announced last month it was exiting Venezuela and had sold its assets to an unnamed Russian state oil company. The company has since stopped shipping gasoline to Venezuela in exchange for some crude shipments, resulting in acute shortages of motor fuel across the South American country.","Washington has also pressured other companies that swap fuel for Venezuela's crude, including Spain's Repsol REP.MC, to stop. The official said on Wednesday it had made clear to Repsol such swaps were ""sanctionable.""","Asked whether Rosneft has done enough to get sanctions lifted on its trading unit, the official said: “Not yet.”","Washington was watching closely to see whether Rosneft Trading “permanently ceases any interaction with the Maduro regime,” the official said."

U.S. special envoy for Venezuela, Elliott Abrams, declined to comment. The U.S. Treasury did not comment beyond repeating that the license expires on April 22.","“Chevron is a positive presence in Venezuela,” Fohr said. The company’s share of production from its joint ventures with PDVSA averaged some 35,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day in 2019, representing about 6% of the country’s total production.","“If Chevron is forced to leave Venezuela, non-U.S. companies will fill the void and oil production will continue,” he said.","Senior State Department officials had argued against cancelling Chevron’s license for now, but the White House has backed the idea of taking action, one of the sources told Reuters.","Buyers in China, India and Europe continued importing after sanctions last year, so Venezuela’s oil exports did not fall as much as some U.S. officials expected.

Nearly half of U.S. gas production is a by-product of oil drilling, and therefore does not change in response to weak prices, analysts said.","In response, BP Plc, Repsol SA and Equinor ASA have written off more than $11 billion in total from the value of North American shale assets just this year.","Industry players, consultants and analysts all said that Chevron’s announcement on Tuesday that it expects to write down the value of its assets by $10 billion to $11 billion this quarter was a sign of more writedowns, with one brokerage highlighting exposure for Exxon Mobil.","“Chevron writing down assets – especially of this magnitude – isn’t just symbolic, it’s indicative of what’s to come with impairment testing across the entire U.S. exploration and production space,” said Dallas Salazar, head of energy consulting firm Atlas Consulting.","Mizuho Securities analysts urged Exxon’s chief executive, Darren Woods, to write down the full value of the company’s $30 billion acquisition of XTO Energy. Exxon bought XTO in 2009 and booked a $2 billion charge in 2017 against the value of natural gas reserves from the buyout.",Exxon did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment.,Chevron late on Tuesday said that more than half of its expected writedown in the fourth quarter is related to its Appalachia gas shale assets. Shares of the company on Wednesday closed down 1.4%.,The writedowns are broadly the result of oil companies having assumed much higher future prices for natural gas over the past decade.,"Shell, for example, said as recently as its 2018 annual report that it expected prices would rise to $3.50 per million British thermal units (mmbtu) in 2020 and 2021 from $3.25 per mmbtu in 2019. BP said it had determined the size of its recoverable reserves based on a long-term price of $4 per mmbtu.","The main benchmark for natural gas has been below $2.70 for most of this year and currently stands around $2.28. IHS Markit projects U.S. gas prices will average below $2 per mmbtu next year, the lowest prices since 1995.","U.S. drillers seeking out more valuable oil produce a lot of unwanted associated gas, making producers insensitive to gas price declines. U.S. energy firms were on track to flare a record amount of that gas in 2019, especially in places like the Permian in West Texas and eastern New Mexico.","“It is likely that undisciplined, Permian byproduct gas production will continue to account for a significant percentage of gas-production growth in the coming years as oil production continues to increase,” S&P Global Ratings said.","For an interactive graphic on gas producers in the United States, click here:",The low prices are caused by the huge gas produced by the Permian shale oil fields in Texas and New Mexico.,"“The real story is the associated gas that’s being produced out of the Permian. It puts a lot of pressure on organic development of natural gas,” said Ben Cook, portfolio manager with BP Capital Fund Advisors LLC.","Artem Abramov, the head of shale research at consultancy firm Rystad Energy, singled out producers in Pennsylvania’s Appalachian basin, which he said would have to make “material” writedowns.","For an interactive graphic on the top 10 Appalachia basin producers, click here:"

Wirth foreshadowed the move by naming Pierre Breber, another cost cutter, as his finance chief earlier this year.","Shale, which did not exist in Chevron’s portfolio 10 years ago, will make up about 27% of its total production by 2023.

After internal debate here within the administration, Trump in late July renewed the waiver for three months.","Some in the administration, like Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, argued that, were Chevron to leave, Maduro might deliver its assets to Russian or Chinese companies, depriving a potential new government of a chance to rebuild the economy in partnership with the U.S. firm. But others, such as former National Security Advisor John Bolton, argued that forcing Chevron out could prompt a further decline in crude output, adding to the economic pressure on Maduro.","With the new deadline looming, residents of La Cañada de Urdaneta, where Petroboscan’s operations are located, fear the company’s exit would add further misery to a drastic deterioration in their quality of life during the last seven years of recession.","“Chevron has supported everything,” said Yennifer Gonzalez, a parent of three students at the San Agustin school in La Cañada, where the company funds meals for students and staff, and is also paying for a construction project. “If Chevron leaves, here in the field things will not be the same.","By law, PDVSA’s joint ventures are required to invest 1% of their profits in social programs in the areas where they extract crude.

But both have halted production completely at times in recent months, as Washington’s sanctions scare away buyers and Venezuela’s storage tanks near capacity, according to sources and documents seen by Reuters.",None of the dozen pumpjacks that Reuters observed while driving through the Boscan field on Oct. 14 and Oct. 15 were turning.,"Should Chevron be ordered to depart, that would be unlikely to have a major impact on Maduro, analysts said.","“Two million barrels to 600,000 barrels and these guys are still there,” said Francisco Monaldi, an energy economist at Rice University in Houston, referring to Maduro’s government. “And you think that because of 100,000 (fewer bpd) it’s going to make a difference?”","Even with Chevron’s help, Brito’s patience with his miniscule wages is wearing thin. He held back tears when talking about his four children who have moved to Colombia, where he said many Petroboscan workers would emigrate if Chevron left.","“I can tell you because I’m one of them,” he said. “I’ll sell what I have here, pack my bags, and I’ll drive away in my truck.”"

Concho, Devon, EOG, Occidental and Exxon declined to comment.","Chevron’s deals, ranging from large-scale joint ventures to small deals where it has leased land to other operators, give it a share of the oil its partners produce.","They also provide data from thousands of wells stretching back years, allowing Chevron to hone drilling strategies. In return, partners get access to areas adjacent to their wells and pipelines, reducing their costs.",Shale drilling has helped the United States reverse decades of declines in output to become the world’s largest oil producer and all the major U.S. oil companies have jumped on the shale bandwagon to boost their own production.,"Unlike conventional oil fields, however, shale wells decline quickly, producing most of their oil in the first few years, so fields such as the Permian Basin require constant, and costly, drilling just to keep production steady.","“If there’s a downside, that’s the downside,” said Jeff Gustavson, who oversees Chevron’s Permian operations. “You’re always having to put more in.”","At a site near Midland, Texas, know-how gleaned from Cimarex and other partners is helping Chevron drill a series of ultra-deep wells - named after the mythical three-headed hound Cerberus - to reach an oil-rich layer more than a mile underground.","The alliances and vast land holdings Chevron can tap allow it to drill longer wells than some rivals, giving it an edge as long wells generally pump more oil and save money.","Chevron said its Permian wells average nearly 9,000 feet (2,743 meters) this year, while consultancy Wood Mackenzie said the industry average is 8,500 feet. Next year, its wells will stretch almost 10,000 feet on average.","In one formation near Midland, Chevron’s peak average production rate runs at 760 barrels per day (bpd) for each well while rivals are producing at 705 bpd, according to IHS Markit.","Shale drilling combines horizontal wells with hydraulic fracturing, the process of pumping water, sand and chemicals at high pressure to crack rocks that hold oil and gas.","Those wells and partnerships in the Permian, the fastest growing shale field, are critical to Chevron’s future.",It missed the first phase of the shale boom early this decade but reversed course in 2014 when it drilled its first horizontal well in Permian and embarked on an investment spree to try to become the world’s largest shale oil producer.,"It has been shedding assets in the North Sea, Africa and Asia and expects to sell up to another $10 billion worth of properties to focus on projects including the Permian, where it has controlled some of the best and cheapest acreage since the 1920s.","Those holdings helped lift Chevron’s oil and gas output to a record high in the second quarter. In the Permian, output leapt 56% from a year earlier to 421,000 bpd and Chevron’s goal is to pump 900,000 bpd from the oilfield by 2023.","Chevron’s Gustavson said its long-standing relationships provide it with “all of the data, all of the cost information” from wells across the basin. “It’s a huge advantage. Huge.”",For a chart of the top Permian drillers:,Chevron is not the only energy company claiming a unique position in the Permian Basin.,"Occidental outbid Chevron for Anadarko Petroleum in a takeover battle this year, spending $38 billion and vowing to use its technology to squeeze more oil from the deal which gave it a combined 3 million Permian acres.","Exxon, meanwhile, spent $6.6 billion two years ago to buy more Permian land and is now running nearly three times more rigs than Chevron in a race to reach its target of producing 1 million bpd of shale by 2024.","But Chevron has two key advantages: it holds 2.2 million Permian acres, second only to the Occidental-Anadarko trove, and it owns mineral rights on much of its land so it doesn’t pay the 20%-25% production royalties most rivals face.","Chevron’s Permian oil and gas output last quarter was second to Occidental’s 533,000 bpd, but rising faster. Exxon is in the top 10 with production of 274,000 bpd.",For a chart of the top Permian land holders:,"Chevron’s mineral rights reduce its breakeven, or the oil price it needs to make a profit, while other savings come from drilling ventures. Chevron operates 20 rigs, far fewer than the 56 Exxon operated in June and Occidental-Anadarko’s 27.",But Chevron estimates its partners contributed the equivalent of another seven to 10 rigs.,"Cimarex struck a small deal with Chevron in 2009 to drill on its land and share data, and then broadened the agreement in 2013, said Michael DeShazer, Permian manager at Cimarex.","He said the two companies were able to learn faster, deploy faster and, by sharing resources, they could more easily invest in infrastructure such as pipelines, roads and electricity.","Shale output drops sharply the first year and declines 80% to 90% over two to three years, but Chevron has been able to slow the decrease.","In the formation near Midland, Chevron’s wells lost 52% of their output after the first 12 months compared with an average decline of 70% for rivals, according to IHS Markit. Output from Chevron’s wells in the first two years was also 40% higher.","While most shale firms have spent heavily but failed to deliver the returns demanded by investors, Chevron’s “slow and steady” approach to the Permian is welcomed by investor Matrix Asset Advisors, which holds 55,000 Chevron shares.","“They’ve got a game plan. They’re executing on the plan,” said Matrix President David Katz."

Growth in LNG exports has been a big contributor to Australia’s rising CO2 emissions, according to the Environment and Energy Department.","“We are pleased to reach the first milestone of safely starting the operation of the Gorgon carbon dioxide injection system, one of the world’s largest greenhouse gas mitigation projects ever undertaken by industry,” Chevron Australia Managing Director Al Williams said in a statement.","The facility, which will be ramped up over several months, will reduce Gorgon’s emissions by 40 percent over the life of the project, the company said.",Western Australia’s state government approved the $54 billion Gorgon project in 2009 on condition that some carbon dioxide from its gas processing operations would be stored.,"Once fully up and running, between 3.4 million and 4 million tonnes a year of carbon dioxide will be buried, Chevron said.","LNG projects separate carbon dioxide before gas is liquefied to stop the gas from freezing. At other plants, CO2 is vented into the air.","Australia, the world’s largest carbon emitter per capita, emitted 538.2 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2018, up 0.7% from the previous year, mainly due to increased LNG exports.","Gorgon LNG is owned by Chevron, Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N, Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L, and Japan's Osaka Gas 9532.T, Tokyo Gas 9531.T and JERA 9501.T9502.T."

It remains committed to selling about $15 billion in assets through 2021, although proceeds this year have totaled $140 million, down from $1.75 billion a year earlier.","Chevron’s Permian Basin production rose 50% from the same period a year ago and is overall output hit 3.08 million barrels per day, up 9% from a year ago and a record level.","Chevron does not “need to do a deal” in the Permian, said Pierre Breber, chief financial officer, who noted that the company has moved in the past when it saw an opportunity."

Chevron was up 3.8 percent to $121.99 since withdrawing, but is down 5.3 percent in the last 52 weeks.",Chevron has been a poster-child for spending restraint and called the bid for Anadarko a reaction to the “industrial logic” of two companies with similar operations. It pledged to restrict annual capital spending to around $20 billion through next year to return more cash to investors.,"Avoiding overspending on shale is “what shareholders have been advocating for,” said Andrew Dittmar, an M&A analyst at researcher Drillinginfo. “Chevron stock got a decent pop on a lousy day for the market.”","Despite a large acreage position and the “strongest royalty position of anybody in the Permian,” Wirth said the No. 2 U.S. oil producer this year will restrict its drilling program in the top U.S. shale patch to just 20 rigs, less than half that of rival Exxon, while aiming to reach output of 900,000 barrels per day by 2023.","The issue for Chevron and other large producers thinking of expanding in the Permian is how much more production they can wring from an asset, said Kris Nicol, head of U.S. corporate research at consultancy Wood Mackenzie.","“A lot of companies are undervalued,” Nicol said.","There is more involved to making an acquisition pay off than the purchase price. “The question is, once you get that company, what can you do with it?” Nicol asked.","Still, after years of letting small independents dominate shale, the majors have “come around” to the importance of the fields’ fast-cycle production, said Matt Sallee, portfolio manager with Tortoise Capital.","Anadarko’s agreement to be acquired by Occidental for $38 billion in cash and stock “makes it more likely that others will want to do something big to compete,” he said."

By Thursday, Chevron had bowed out.","In edging out Chevron, Hollub leaned on global relationships and knowledge forged from 35 years in the oil industry, according to about a dozen people familiar with the talks leading up to the company’s latest offer.","Occidental had struggled to win over Anadarko because its first public $38 billion offer of 50 percent cash and 50 percent stock, as well as previous offers made privately, required the approval of Occidental shareholders, and Anadarko was not convinced they would go for the deal, two sources familiar with the discussions told Reuters.","Hollub knew she needed to substantially increase the cash offer - thereby making shareholder approval unnecessary - and moved swiftly to secure it, the sources said.","She was in Paris on April 26, just two weeks after Chevron’s announcement, and struck an $8.8 billion deal with French major Total SA to sell Anadarko assets her company didn’t yet own.","Two days later she was in Omaha, Nebraska, securing $10 billion in financing from billionaire investor Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc, who typically does not partner with companies pursuing unsolicited takeovers.",Occidental declined to make Hollub available for an interview for this story. The company’s shares are down 9 percent since making their offer public in late April.,"The combined company would establish Occidental as the largest operator in the Permian basin in west Texas and New Mexico, the heart of the U.S. shale revolution, where a boom in production has propelled the United States into becoming the world’s largest oil producer.","It would make Occidental the third-largest U.S. oil company with a market value of about $80 billion, dwarfed only by global giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron.","“She’s doing the boldest M&A thing that’s happened since the ‘80s,” said Amy Myers Jaffe, energy consultant and senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. “You’re having an atypical M&A battle in a very competitive space where (usually) the bigger you are, the more you’re going to win.”",Hollub’s challenge has stunned an industry where the last attempt to break up an agreed-upon deal between two U.S. oil companies was in 1984 when Texaco challenged Pennzoil’s acquisition of Getty Oil.,It has also angered some Occidental investors who say Hollub is overstretching the company’s balance sheet in an ill-advised quest for size in a volatile industry.,"“Our concern is the willingness of the management team at Occidental to cut very favorable deals against the interests of shareholders on a longer-term basis,” said John Linehan, portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price.","T. Rowe, the sixth-largest holder of Occidental shares, announced it would vote against the board of directors on the annual shareholder meeting Friday. But such a move may be mostly symbolic.",An Occidental spokesman declined to comment on the concerns but pointed to Hollub’s defense of her strategy that it was better to raise cash than issue new debt.,"Hollub’s background in the technical aspects of oil production contrasts with her predecessor, a banker and known dealmaker. She has been described as down to earth by former and current employees, differing from flamboyant energy CEOs.","Buying Anadarko was seen as the best way for Occidental to gain more acreage in the Permian shale basin, where it markets nearly a quarter of all barrels produced in the region.","When Chevron announced a deal on April 12 to buy Anadarko, Hollub gathered the merger team. They were shocked that Anadarko had accepted a bid that was $11 per share below what Occidental had privately offered, three of the people familiar with the discussions said.","“She thought, we’re in it to win it. Let’s make our offer public so their shareholders know what they passed up,” one of the sources said.","In a letter to Anadarko’s board of directors on April 24, Occidental said they “were surprised and disappointed” that Anadarko had not agreed to their previous two offers in April.","Anadarko executives, however, remained concerned that Occidental shareholders could scuttle the deal, leaving them without a buyer, two sources familiar with the situation said. The board of directors wanted to stick with Chevron.","Just two days after sending the letter, Hollub was in Paris meeting with Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne to discuss Anadarko’s African assets, according to two sources familiar with the discussions.","The two already had a relationship stemming from the Dolphin Gas Project, a Middle East cross-border gas initiative where both companies have an equal share. Total had made it known to her that they coveted Anadarko’s properties, including a liquefied natural gas project in Mozambique.","“Vicki wanted to show that she could quickly put the cash on the table. In less than 10 days she had the cash ready,” a Paris-based source said.","Omaha, Nebraska was next. Buffett is known for moving quickly when a deal piques his interest, but he tends to avoid getting involved in hostile takeover bids.","The meeting was set up by BofA CEO Brian Moynihan, whose bank was helping to provide financing for the Anadarko deal. Hollub later said Buffett was “warm and wonderful” in their meeting, a source familiar with the discussions said.","Buffett, cash flush and on the hunt for new deals, agreed to provide $10 billion in financing in return for an 8 percent premium, a concern for dividend-focused shareholders who believe the terms are too pricey.","The two deals enabled Hollub to submit a revised offer on Sunday, increasing the cash component from 50 percent to 78 percent.","On Thursday, Chevron said it would collect its $1 billion termination fee and walk away from the negotiations.",(For a graphic on 'Oxy-Anadarko would be third largest U.S. oil company' click tmsnrt.rs/2VSZ3hY)

Chevron, the No. 2 U.S. oil producer, received a $1 billion breakup fee, which it has said it will apply to a $5 billion share repurchase program.","Chevron shares closed 3.1 percent higher on Thursday at $121.19 while shares of Occidental fell 6.4 percent to $56.33, the lowest in a decade.",Anadarko shares fell 3.3 percent to $73.39.,"Chevron Chief Executive Officer Mike Wirth said the company decided at a board meeting on Wednesday to walk away from the takeover battle, even though it could have matched or beaten Occidental’s offer and saw Anadarko as a strategic fit.","“Make no mistake. We have the financial capacity to outbid Occidental, but we concluded that an increased offer would have eroded value to our shareholders, and it would have diminished returns on capital,” Wirth said. “The bar is high. We don’t have a need to do anything. We are not desperate to do a deal.”","Chevron’s decision demonstrated strong capital discipline, said Jennifer Rowland, analyst with Edward Jones.","“I am a bit surprised that they walked, but am pleased that they didn’t get caught up in a bidding war with Oxy, who comes across as willing to fight to win at all costs,” Rowland said. “Anadarko was a unique fit for Chevron, so I don’t expect them to go on a shopping spree in the Permian.”","Anadarko’s major assets - in U.S. shale, the Gulf of Mexico and an liquefied natural gas project in Mozambique - were seen as a logical fit for Chevron, but not something the company needed. “Chevron has no objective need to acquire Anadarko - or, for that matter, engage in any other large-scale (mergers and acquisitions),” said Pavel Molchanov, an analyst with Raymond James.",Analysts said they do not expect another bidder for Anadarko to emerge.,"“The industry is trying to show investors more capital discipline and if another suitor comes in that would be significantly counter to most companies’ strategies,” analysts at RBC Capital Markets said in a note on Thursday.","Investors have sold off shares of oil companies that increased spending on drilling instead of returning cash to shareholders. They have called for capital discipline, defined as increasing production by 4 percent a year and maintaining a 4 percent dividend.",One result: The value of U.S. oil and gas mergers and acquisitions fell to a 10-year low in the first quarter as investors sold shares of companies that spent more on drilling than on buybacks and dividends.,"The contest for Anadarko underscored the value of its assets in the Permian Basin, the vast shale field with oil and gas deposits that can produce supplies for decades using low-cost drilling techniques.","The region’s soaring production has propelled U.S. oil production to 12 million barrels per day (bpd), more than that of Russia or Saudi Arabia.",Anadarko said on Thursday it had signed a definitive agreement with Occidental and expects the merger to be completed in the second half of the year. The deal still faces antitrust reviews.,"Chevron holds 2.3 million acres in the Permian Basin and has vast mineral ownership there, which reduces its royalty rate. It expects shale production from the basin to reach 600,000 bpd by the end of next year, and 900,000 bpd by the end of 2023.",Occidental outmaneuvered Chevron by gaining cash and allies.,"It got a $10 billion investment from Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc and struck a deal with French oil giant Total SA to take most of Anadarko’s international assets, including a liquefied natural gas project in Mozambique. Total agreed to pay $8.8 billion for the assets once the merger goes ahead.","Several Occidental investors oppose the deal, including its sixth-largest shareholder, T. Rowe Price Group Inc, because they consider it too large a risk if oil prices falter, or if Occidental cannot produce the $3.5 billion a year in cost savings it has promised.","Ratings agency Moody’s Investors Service said on Wednesday it likely would downgrade Occidental if it prevailed in the takeover, noting the deal would add $46 billion of debt before any sale of assets.",Several investors also have criticized Occidental’s decision this week to secure Anadarko’s endorsement by excluding a shareholder vote on the deal.

Chevron walked away from the race on Thursday.,"By keeping those in the know to a minimum, the French CEO was able to stay flexible in negotiations, take a swift decision and ensure there were no leaks until the binding deal worth $8.8 billion was announced on Sunday, a Total source said.","“Pouyanne proceeded in the same way he did with previous deals: a restricted task force, no bankers and no external counsel,” another source, close to the deal, told Reuters.","Throwing out the rulebook that expects CEOs to be surrounded by investment bankers and other advisers when dealmaking has become a trademark for the 55-year-old CEO and chairman of Total, who took the helm of the French energy major in 2014.","He has taken investors by surprise with his acquisitions, such as buying Maersk’s oil and gas business in 2017 and Engie’s upstream LNG operations in 2018, setting one deal in motion after an unsolicited phone call with the controlling shareholder.","His strategy, which one analyst has called “opportunistic”, has rapidly lifted Total’s growth outlook. Total has made acquisitions worth almost $20 billion in the past five years, under Pouyanne’s leadership.","But the buying spree has increased debt and left its shares lagging rivals, such as Royal Dutch Shell and BP . His manner can also come across as brash, and industry sources say it was one reason a deal to buy a Libyan oilfield stake has now run into a roadblock.","Pouyanne’s move to buy Anadarko’s assets, the French firm’s biggest acquisition since taking over Elf almost two decades ago, will add 5 percent to Total’s output by 2025, said Bernstein analysts, who rate Total’s shares “outperform”.","The assets stretching from Algeria to South Africa bolster his effort to refocus Total on operations in Africa, the North Sea, deep offshore and liquefied natural gas (LNG). The deal depends on Occidental (Oxy) completing the Anadarko merger.","“Pouyanne quickly understood that it could be a match made in heaven because Oxy was mainly focused on Anadarko’s Permian assets. And Pouyanne has repeatedly said he was not interested in Permian,” a source close to the deal said, referring to the Permian Basin where the U.S. shale oil industry is concentrated.","Total has built up a strong balance sheet under Pouyanne since the 2014 oil price crash, giving him the firepower to swoop on Anadarko’s assets. But Total was also able to act swiftly because it has long had its eye on the African operations.","“Total was already familiar with Anadarko’s portfolio. At some point, they took a closer look at Anadarko’s assets, particularly in Africa. There were some discussions, but they did not go any further,” an industry source said.",Another source said Anadarko had been looking for a partner for its Mozambique LNG project to tap an estimated 75 trillion cubic feet of recoverable gas.,"Two days after Occidental announced its bid for Anadarko on April 24, Oxy’s corporate jet was on the tarmac in Paris.","Both firms declined to comment on the reason for the jet’s flight to Paris, although an industry source told Reuters the jet was flown in for a meeting with Total.","Another source familiar with the matter said Occidental Chief Executive Officer Vicki Hollub had flown in with another executive, without telling anybody, to discuss Anadarko’s African assets with Total.","“Of course they (Total) had already thought about it. And I think they reached out to her and said ‘Hey Vicki, if you happen to win this, we would really be interested’,” the second source said. “She did not let the phone get cold. She left and flew to Paris overnight, met with them and heard their deal.”",Occidental did not comment on the account.,A banking source said this deal was not the first time Total had held talks without bankers in the room. The source said it made sense in this case because Total did not need financing and wanted to make a quick decision.,"Shell, the world’s top LNG buyer and trader, had been considering an approach to Oxy for the Mozambique asset but was caught off guard by Total’s rapid move, a source close to the company said. A Shell spokeswoman declined to comment.","It was not the first time Pouyanne surprised the market. He first made a splash in 2017 with the purchase of Maersk’s energy business for $7.5 billion after an unsolicited bid made in a phone call to Ane Maersk Mc-Kinney Uggla, chairwoman of the A.P. Moller Foundation, which has a controlling stake, a corporate source said.","“The deal was unplanned but it was a good fit. A banker gave Patrick the idea and he made it happen,” the source said.",Maersk could not immediately be reached for comment.,But Pouyanne’s manner does not always win over partners.,"When he boasted to a U.S. energy conference about the benefits to Total of his deal to buy a $450 million stake in a Libyan field from Marathon Oil last year, Libya’s state-owned National Oil Corporation sought to re-negotiate terms, concerned it was too much of a bargain, industry sources said.",Total has said it was in talks with Libyan authorities to resolve financial issues over the deal.

Another oil company, Occidental Petroleum Corp, launched an unsolicited $38 billion bid for Anadarko on April 24, which Anadarko said on Monday it would negotiate.","The first suspicious purchases were made on Feb. 8, two days after Chevron privately proposed an acquisition to Anadarko, according to the SEC. All told, 1,650 call options were purchased across four transactions between then and April 1. Each purchase accounted for a large portion of such call purchases on each particular day.","Buying a call option conveys the right, but not the obligation, to purchase shares at a fixed price in the future. The value of calls can jump sharply when the underlying stock’s price rises.","For example, in one of the trades laid out in the SEC filing, on April 1, 650 Anadarko contracts betting on the shares rising above $50 by mid-May were bought for $1.07 per contract.","By April 12, these calls traded as high as $13.18, according to Refinitive data.","The SEC said the unknown parties stand to make roughly $2.5 million in illicit profits from the trading, after selling or exercising the options to buy company stock after the potential deal was announced, which sent the company’s stock higher. The day Chevron announced it planned to purchase Anadarko, the company’s stock jumped 32 percent.","While it has not yet identified specific individuals, the SEC believes the traders are located outside the United States, adding there is a “significant risk” the illicit proceeds may move overseas shortly.","The asset freeze orders any parties that receive notice must not withdraw, transfer or dispose of assets related to the allegations.","The SEC declined to comment on the case beyond its complaint, while Anadarko could not immediately be reached for comment.","Options activity has been known to spike before the public announcement of deals and other news that tends to move stock prices, and the SEC has in the past announced enforcement action for alleged insider trading involving options.","Anadarko shares have trailed other energy companies in recent years, but they recently got a boost from the twin takeover offers.","On Monday afternoon, its shares were trading largely steady at about $72.79."

Anadarko announced a deal with Chevron on April 12 after snubbing a higher bid from Occidental, prompting Occidental to try to upend the Chevron deal.","“We hope Anadarko will proceed quickly to secure this superior transaction for its shareholders,” an Occidental spokeswoman said.",Anadarko said its board had unanimously decided that Occidental’s offer could result in a “superior proposal” but added that its deal with Chevron remained in effect until it decided to cut a new deal with Occidental.,"Anadarko asked Chevron on Sunday if it wanted to raise its bid and Chevron declined, people familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday.","Chevron is reluctant to pay more for Anadarko and does not want to be drawn into a bidding war, the sources said. Chevron also wants to see if Occidental will manage to ink a deal for Anadarko, and whether Occidental shareholders will support it, one of the sources said.","“We believe our signed agreement with Anadarko provides the best value and the most certainty to Anadarko’s shareholders,” Chevron said in a statement on Monday.","Chevron and Occidental are vying for one of the biggest prizes in the oil industry: Anadarko’s nearly quarter-million-acre holdings in the core of the Permian Basin, the top U.S. shale field.",The two companies each control land adjacent to Anadarko’s properties and expect a deal will add deposits that can produce supplies for decades using low-cost drilling techniques.,"Occidental unveiled its bid for Anadarko last Wednesday, offering to pay for it half in cash and half with its own shares. Chevron’s deal with Anadarko was structured as 25 percent cash and 75 percent stock. Occidental’s stock was down 2.38 percent to $59.85.","Anadarko shares were up 0.4 percent to $73.05, slightly below the value of Occidental’s offer.","Under the terms of the merger agreement, Chevron has four days after being notified by Anadarko’s board to respond with a counter-offer. If Anadarko proceeds with a sale to Occidental, it will have to pay Chevron a $1 billion deal breakup fee.","The acquisition of Anadarko would add nearly a quarter million acres to Occidental’s holdings in the Permian shale basin, and double its global oil and gas production to 1.4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day.",A key hurdle that Occidental has to overcome in its negotiations with Anadarko is that its proposed deal is contingent on Occidental shareholders voting to approve it.,"These could make a deal more vulnerable to shareholder agitation. For example, activist hedge fund Starboard Value LP tried to shoot down Bristol-Myers Co’s $74 billion deal to acquire biotech Celgene Corp earlier this year by trying to convince Bristol-Myers shareholders to vote it down. It was ultimately unsuccessful.","A deal with Chevron offers more certainty to Anadarko in that regard, because Chevron shareholders will not be given a vote. Anadarko shareholders will be given a vote on the sale of the company, be it with Occidental or Chevron.","Chevron and Occidental also have put forward different estimates on the value of the operational synergies they can derive from Anadarko. Chevron projects the synergies to be worth $1 billion a year, while Occidental says it can extract $2 billion annually in synergies."

Deep-pocketed oil majors such as Chevron can better cope with these costs, because they can get cheaper drilling rates by committing to longer contacts and afford cutting-edge technology to get more out of wells.","Shale producers such as Pioneer Natural Resources, Continental Resources, Diamondback Energy and Concho Resources have already been under pressure from investors to improve their profitability.

The combined company will produce an estimated 3.9 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), trailing only Exxon Mobil Corp among publicly traded companies, up from fourth. It expands Chevron’s reach in two areas where U.S. energy output is breaking records: shale from the Permian Basin of west Texas and New Mexico, and liquefied natural gas (LNG). These have helped make the United States one of the world’s largest energy exporters.","“Chevron now joins the ranks of the ‘ultra majors’ – and the big three becomes the big four,” said Roy Martin, senior analyst at consultants Wood Mackenzie. “The acquisition makes the majors’ peer group much more polarized. Exxon Mobil, Chevron, Shell and BP are now in a league of their own.”","These companies are turning to shale and its revolutionary techniques of fracking, blasting sand and water into formations to extract oil. This is cheaper and produces oil more quickly than costlier offshore and LNG projects that take years to generate cash.","The shale oil-and-gas boom reversed a long decline in U.S. crude production and propelled the country to a record 12 million barrels a day (bpd), more than Russia and Saudi Arabia. The United States is also now the third-largest producer of LNG, super-cooled natural gas that enjoys record demand as a cheaper, cleaner alternative than coal for power generation.","The combined companies are expected to produce more than 1.6 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in the United States this year and 3.9 million boepd globally, according to Wood Mackenzie.","Chevron Chief Executive Officer Mike Wirth said the deal offers a “compelling and unique fit” because the companies operate in similar areas, both with holdings in shale, offshore, and LNG projects. Chevron also expects shale to generate profits for its pipeline, trading and refining units.","“We are the best company to combine with Anadarko and Anadarko is the best company to combine with us,” Wirth said in an interview.","Chevron’s pledge to restrain expenditures has made it a favorite among energy stocks, with its shares up 13.8 percent this year.

Honestly, we don’t have the expertise,” he said. “But if you talk about control, it is a very delicate word in terms of management. I would like to say we both control.”","Jonan added that Indonesia, which produces and exports large amounts of coal, currently viewed the fuel as critical to keeping electricity costs down for its population.","“We have a serious concern about global warming and are trying to reduce the use of coal as the primary energy for our power plants,” he said. “But we go with the affordability for the public.”",He said Indonesia would find it difficult to reach its target of generating 23 percent of its power from renewable sources by 2025 - as pledged under the 2015 Paris Agreement to combat climate change - but remained hopeful it could reach somewhere above 20 percent by that time.

The workers balked at the high costs of the parts and a lack of competitive bids.","Venezuela’s foreign minister, Jorge Arreaza, linked the Chevron arrests to the government anti-corruption probe for the first time on Wednesday.","“In our oil industry and in its relationships with other countries, there has been corruption,” Arreaza said at a news conference at the United Nations headquarters in New York that was broadcast on Venezuela state television. “The decisions of the prosecutor’s office are based on serious investigations to fight corruption ... These two people involved have the right to defense and due process.”","Of Chevron’s evacuation of executives, Arreaza said: “The logical decision would be to turn themselves over to authorities and demonstrate their innocence ... not to flee.”","Chevron spokeswoman Isabel Ordonez responded to the minister’s comments with a written statement that the firm “abides by a code of business ethics, under which we comply with all applicable U.S. and Venezuelan laws.”",Chevron’s move to evacuate its expatriate workforce underscores the how arduous it has become for foreign oil firms and their workers to sustain operations through Venezuela’s accelerating political and economic meltdown. The affected staff numbers about 30 people in the coastal city of Puerto la Cruz.,Chevron’s Ordonez said the company had an executive team overseeing operations in Venezuela but declined to provide details on the leadership there or the number and type of workers the company had withdrawn.,"Last week, the company said it was working for the release of the detained workers, Carlos Algarra and Rene Vasquez, who are represented by Chevron lawyers.","Chevron has no plans to exit the country, according to a person familiar with the thinking of its board of directors. The oil company has not pulled out of other tough environments in the past, the person said - citing the jailing of employees in Indonesia in 2013 - and the firm believes Venezuela will eventually stabilize.","Chevron, the world’s seventh-largest publicly traded oil producer with 2017 revenue of $135 billion, operates in Venezuela mostly through minority stakes in five projects across the OPEC-member nation.","The firm has about 150 employees in its Puerto la Cruz headquarters and has two more offices in the country. Its earnings from Venezuela dropped 18 percent last year, to $329 million, according to regulatory filings.","The arrests mark an escalation of tensions between PDVSA and foreign companies over control of supply contracts and the joint ventures’ governance, sources familiar with the dispute told Reuters.","Outside firms say they are increasingly faced with impossible dilemmas. If their executives sign contracts without following their companies’ due process rules, they run the risk of violating compliance standards meant to control costs and guard against corruption. If they don’t sign, they stoke tension with their partners at PDVSA, which has a controlling interest in all joint ventures.","Companies evaluating an exit from Venezuela have limited options because few if any international firms would pay anything close to full value for assets in the country amid the ongoing turmoil, according to interviews with three executives of oil firms that have operated in Venezuela. But continuing operations often means stomaching steep losses, taking massive write-downs - and, now, the threat of having staff arrested by the embattled socialist government of President Nicolas Maduro.","PDVSA’s deteriorating infrastructure and cash flow have caused oil production to plunge 33 percent in a year, to 1.51 million barrels per day (bpd) in March, according to official data reported to OPEC. Venezuela’s oil output so far this year is at a 33-year low.","The falling production and arrests of PDVSA executives on allegations of corruption picked up speed late last year after Maduro named a military chief with no oil industry experience, Major General Manuel Quevedo, as the nation’s oil minister and president of PDVSA.","Several of Chevron’s foreign staff and some local executives and their families left Venezuela starting last week after the arrests, the four sources familiar with their departures told Reuters. They described the situation as temporary, and said executives may return if proposed talks between Chevron and PDVSA to resolve the dispute are successful.","Chevron executives have had high-level meetings with Venezuelan government officials this week, said two of the people familiar with the matter.","Chevron and other firms aim to avoid a repeat of what happened to Exxon Mobil Corp and ConocoPhillips in Venezuela in 2007, when the government of then-President Hugo Chavez expropriated their assets after they could not reach an agreement to convert their projects into PDVSA-controlled joint ventures.","“No company can leave because it would lose the assets,” said a former negotiator of Exxon’s 2007 exit from Venezuela. “At this point, there are just a few options.”","Chevron employees remaining in Venezuela are concerned they may be vulnerable to detention following the departure of senior management, according to interviews with employees and family members.","The arrested Chevron workers oversaw operations and procurement at Petropiar, an oil production and processing project co-owned by PDVSA and Chevron.","Chevron has asked employees assigned to Petropiar to temporarily work from the firm’s Puerto la Cruz office rather than show up at its partner’s oil production and processing facilities, according to one person familiar with the situation.","The two men had refused to sign a multi-million dollar contract under an emergency decree to buy imported parts required by Petropiar, according to six sources with knowledge of the contract dispute. Such decrees, which skip competitive bidding, have been cited by Venezuelan and U.S. prosecutors as a means of extracting bribes in some recent corruption cases.","Algarra and Vasquez are now being held in a detention center in Barcelona run by Venezuela’s intelligence unit, known as Sebin. Coworkers and relatives have brought them food to supplement what they are provided, a person familiar with the matter said.","Several other foreign energy companies have written down the value of their Venezuela assets by hundreds of millions of dollars or halted most operations, keeping only a skeletal staff in the country.",Spain’s Repsol took a pre-tax charge of about $1 billion on its Venezuelan assets in the prior quarter. Italy’s ENI said it was owed 500 million euros ($615 million) in delinquent payments from PDVSA last year.,"Service provider Schlumberger wrote down its Venezuelan holdings in the fourth quarter by $938 million. Halliburton earlier this month said it wrote off all remaining assets in the country, adding a $312 million charge on top of $647 million in charges last year.","Other international oil firms, including France’s Total SA, have withdrawn foreign staff in recent years and reduced investment as living conditions have deteriorated.","“I can tell you it is difficult for our people because of lack of power, lack of water,” said Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanne last week at an oil summit in Paris.","The company would maintain a presence there, however, on the hope the crisis would ease.","“It is important to stay in a country even in difficult times,” Pouyanne said, “because people will remember it.”"

U.S. oil major Chevron Corp CVX.N has evacuated executives from Venezuela after two of its workers were imprisoned over a contract dispute with state-owned oil company PDVSA, according to four sources familiar with the matter.","“The geopolitical risk in the market has a pretty high premium,” said Gene McGillian, vice president of research at Tradition Energy. “Even with this week’s Department of Energy numbers it hasn’t shaken any of the confidence that the global supply and demand balance continue to tighten.”","Brent crude LCOc1 settled 14 cents higher at $74.00 a barrel, below the November 2014 intraday high of $75.47 reached on Tuesday. U.S. crude futures CLc1 ended up 35 cents at $68.05 a barrel.","The market rebounded quickly from a dip after bearish U.S. inventory data because the build was not as large as it could have been, given the jump in exports, McGillian said.","Crude inventories USOILC=ECI rose 2.2 million barrels last week, compared with expectations for a 2 million-barrel draw. Crude stocks at the Cushing, Oklahoma, delivery hub USOICC=ECI rose 459,000 barrels, EIA said.","A rise in U.S. government borrowing costs to their highest since 2013 this week has tempered some investor appetite for risk, but analysts said Brent crude futures, the global benchmark, may yet rise toward new 2018 peaks above $75 a barrel.","Supplier cutbacks, steady demand growth, geopolitical tensions and a favorable structure in the futures market have attracted record investment in oil this year.","Money managers hold record positions in Brent crude futures and options, lured by the hefty premium of the front-month June contract over subsequent months that makes it profitable to invest in crude over the longer term.","“The prospect of a downside correction in prices is lost on the speculative fraternity. In fact, financial players have rarely felt more optimistic. Bets on rising crude prices are close to a near-record high,” PVM Oil Associates strategist Stephen Brennock said.","“However, given the already vast holdings of long positions in oil, there are doubts over the scope for further inflows.”","The forward curve for Brent <0#LCO:> is now above $70 until the end of 2018, and prices are above $60 through 2020.","But the rise in U.S. Treasury yields above 3 percent has driven the dollar .DXY to three-month highs, making oil more expensive for buyers using other currencies. This might eventually pressure crude prices, even though oil and the dollar have moved in tandem for a few weeks."
