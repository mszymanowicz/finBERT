But it now faces competition from cheaper versions in Europe and a 2023 expiration of its patents in the United States, by far the most profitable market.","AbbVie Chief Executive Richard Gonzalez said the company was able to buy Allergan because of the massive amount of cash that Humira generates. A U.S. corporate tax overhaul under the Trump administration, which helped companies bring back revenue earned overseas, also helped, he said.","“Humira is buying the assets that replace it over the long term,” said Gonzalez, who plans to lead the combined company and remain chairman and CEO through 2023.","Chief among those assets is Allergan’s Botox, an injection of a purified form of botulinum toxin that paralyzes muscles, smoothing frown lines and wrinkles in the forehead and around the eyes. It is also approved to treat chronic migraine headaches, overactive bladder and other medical uses.","But when used as a cosmetic treatment, patients must pay for Botox out of pocket, buffering it from the pricing pressure that health insurers and government health agencies have put on prescription medicines. Gonzalez said he does not expect a biosimilar version of Botox “for a long, long time, if ever.”","Botox had 2018 sales of about $3.6 billion, with $1.55 billion coming from cosmetic uses. Both therapeutic and cosmetic Botox are expected to keep growing, with analysts forecasting total 2019 sales of $3.9 billion and reaching nearly $6 billion by 2025, according to Refinitiv data.","“We believe the increasing concern about AbbVie’s growth potential following the U.S. Humira biosimilar competition in 2023 will be partially alleviated with the increased portfolio of assets that Allergan brings,” said Morningstar analyst Damien Conover.","The deal, coming months after Bristol-Myers Squibb Co agreed to buy Celgene Corp for $74 billion, also highlights renewed interest in major acquisitions by the pharmaceutical industry.","Shares of other specialty drugmakers and potential targets Mylan NV, Bausch Health Co Inc and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd rose, with Teva up 7.6%.","AbbVie shares were down 15.7% at $66.11, while Allergan shares were up 26.7% at $164.20.","AbbVie’s board decided about a year ago that the company needed a major acquisition ahead of Humira’s U.S. patent expiration, Gonzalez said.","He said he first approached Allergan CEO Brent Saunders six or seven weeks ago. In late April, Saunders traveled to Chicago for a meeting and returned a few weeks later to discuss valuation.",AbbVie was looking for a partner with $10 billion to $15 billion in durable revenue that was not expected to decline. Allergan 2019 sales are forecast to be about $15 billion.,"The motivation for this deal differs significantly from AbbVie’s unsuccessful bid in 2014 to buy Irish drugmaker Shire Plc. At that time, AbbVie was looking to take advantage of lower corporate tax rates in Europe, Gonzalez said.","Allergan, formerly based in California, itself was part of a tax “inversion” deal, after European generic drugmaker Actavis bought Allergan for $66 billion in 2015 and adopted the Botox-maker’s name, moving its headquarters to Dublin.",The combined AbbVie and Allergan will be based in AbbVie’s home of North Chicago.,"“The fact that we had tax reform (in the United States) allowed us … to take the company back to the U.S. It reinforces the benefit of tax reform,” Gonzalez told reporters.","The deal follows a string of acquisitions for Allergan under Saunders, who will join AbbVie’s board. Over the last decade, Saunders remade Allergan into one of the world’s biggest pharmaceutical companies, but also saddled it with debt, leaving it less able to invest in research and development",His efforts culminated in a proposed $160 billion purchase by Pfizer Inc. But Pfizer walked away from the transaction in 2016 after the Obama administration cracked down on U.S. companies’ ability to rebase in countries with lower tax rates.,Allergan has since struggled to find new growth. Its shares have lost around half their value and shareholders have pressured Saunders to break up or sell the company. Activist investor David Tepper also ran a campaign urging Allergan to hire an independent chairman.,"Under terms of the deal, Allergan shareholders will receive 0.8660 AbbVie shares and $120.30 in cash for each share held, for a total of $188.24 per Allergan share, a premium of 45% to the stock’s Monday close. Including debt, the deal values Allergan at $83 billion.","The transaction is expected to add 10% to AbbVie’s adjusted earnings per share over the first full year following the close, the companies said.",AbbVie said it expects annual pretax savings and other cost reductions of at least $2 billion in its third year after the deal closes in early 2020. Some cost savings are likely to come cuts to Allergan’s research and development operations.,"“This is yet another transaction driven by diversification, scale and low borrowing costs, rather than portfolio or top line synergies,” SVB Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a note.","Morgan Stanley and PJT Partners were financial advisers to AbbVie, while Kirkland & Ellis provided legal advice. JPMorgan Chase & Co was Allergan’s financial adviser, and its legal counsel were Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz and Arthur Cox."

Allergan has said that it believes the migraine drug could reasonably bring in $500 million a year.","In February, the drug company reported positive results for the 50 and 100mg doses of the pill in another late-stage trial.","This trial backs up those results for the 50mg dose, David Nicholson, Allergan’s Chief Research and Development Officer said in an interview.","“You have to show that a drug reproducibly demonstrates benefit in the population that you intend to treat. We now have two adequate and well controlled studies clearly demonstrating the benefit of ubrogepant in the acute treatment of migraine,” Nicholson said.","In the trial of more than 1,300 patients, 21.8 percent were pain-free two hours after taking the 50mg dose versus 14.3 percent on placebo. About 39 percent in the 50mg group also reported the absence of their most bothersome symptom (MBS), such as nausea or sensitivity to light or sound, compared with 27.4 percent for placebo.

An acquisition of Shire by Takeda would be by far the biggest acquisition of a drug company year-to-date.","Botox-maker Allergan confirmed on Thursday it was considering an offer for Shire after Reuters reported on its interest, sending its shares down 7 percent.","Later on Thursday, Allergan Chief Executive Brent Saunders decided to drop his pursuit of London-listed Shire after receiving pushback from some of his shareholders, who were concerned about the company overstretching its resources, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not be identified discussing confidential talks. Allergan then issued a second announcement stating it did not intend to make an offer for Shire.","Dublin-based Allergan, which has a market capitalization of $52 billion, had $30 billion in debt as of the end of December, the legacy of a string of acquisitions. This has weighed on Allergan’s ability to carry out big acquisitions.","Allergan’s exploration of a bid for Shire was part of its wider strategic review, Allergan said in a statement. This review is currently unlikely to lead either to a major acquisition or a breakup of the company, one of the sources said.","Reuters also first reported on Thursday that Takeda had made a cash-and-stock offer of 46.50 pounds ($66.20) a share for Shire. This prompted both companies to confirm the move and announce that Shire had rejected it, although their negotiations are continuing.","Buying Shire would be the largest ever overseas acquisition by a Japanese company and propel Takeda, led by Frenchman Christophe Weber, into the top ranks of global drugmakers.","It would be Weber’s boldest move by far, significantly boosting Takeda’s position in rare diseases, including a blockbuster hemophilia franchise, gastrointestinal disorders and neuroscience, where Shire is a leader in drugs to treat hyperactivity.","But it would be a big financial stretch since Shire, with a market value of more than 34 billion pounds ($48.3 billion), is worth a lot more than Japan’s biggest drugmaker, which has a market capitalization of 4.1 trillion yen ($31 billion).",An acquisition of Shire would have given Allergan heft in the rare diseases space at a time when Saunders is seeking to cement its status as a purveyor of innovative drugs. Saunders’ plans to sell Allergan to Pfizer for $160 billion were scuppered two years ago after the U.S. Treasury changed the rules on corporate tax inversions.,"Saunders “was a huge deal guy and everyone was kind of waiting for the next big deal,” said Kevin Kedra, an analyst with Gabelli & Co, which holds shares of both Allergan and Shire.","If there was to be a big share component to a deal it would have to come before a vote of shareholders, he noted. “Shareholders seem to be voting this morning,” Kedra said.","Takeda said it would remain disciplined in its approach and intended to maintain its dividend policy and investment-grade credit rating, adding that: “Discussions between the parties regarding a potential offer are ongoing.”","Shire confirmed it had received three conditional proposals from Takeda, but said they significantly undervalued the company’s growth prospects and drugs in development.","Takeda’s latest 46.50 pounds offer was made on April 12 and comprised 17.75 pounds in cash, which would be paid in U.S. dollars, and 28.75 pounds worth of new Takeda shares. Shire said that valued it at approximately 44 billion pounds ($62.6 billion), based on total issued and to be issued share capital.","The two earlier cash-and-share offers were worth 44 and 45.50 pounds per share, respectively.","Under UK takeover rules, Takeda has until April 25 to make a firm offer or walk away, after it said last month it was considering a bid.","Based on Takeda’s market capitalization, Shire shareholders would end up owning approximately 51 percent of the enlarged group, Shire noted.","Bernstein analyst Wimal Kapadia said Shire was likely to be pushing for a larger cash component in current talks but Takeda was already stretched, suggesting the chances of a deal being consummated were still “reasonably risky.”","Shire has been under pressure in the past 12 months, with its shares down by a third before Takeda’s interest was made public, due to greater competition from generic drugs and debts from its $32 billion acquisition of Baxalta in 2016.","Shire said in January it would run its attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) business, which consists mainly of its blockbuster drug Vyvanse, separately and possibly seek a separate listing.",Earlier this week it struck a deal to sell its cancer drugs for $2.4 billion to unlisted French group Servier.
