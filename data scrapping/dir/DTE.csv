The move allows it to raise capital investment to $17 billion over five years, which is important as DTE transitions towards cleaner generation sources, the statement added.",Utilities have shed non-regulated units in recent years as investors prefer the steady earnings performance of regulated power generation.,"Activist investment firm Elliott Management Corp said in a statement it welcomed the announcement, adding it had been talking to DTE management for “several months.” It did not disclose whether it owns shares in DTE Energy.",DTE Energy serves 2.2 million electricity customers and a further 1.3 million gas consumers in Michigan.
