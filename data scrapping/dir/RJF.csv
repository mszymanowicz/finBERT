While shale output was about 8.2 million bpd at the start of the year, at current prices the industry will likely struggle to produce 7 million bpd by 2022, Macklon said.","ConocoPhillips left seven drilling rigs at work in shale fields, but cut all fracking crews earlier this year as oil prices CLc1LCOc1 crashed. It is returning two fracking crews to work, Macklon said.","Some shale producers are stockpiling federal drilling permits ahead of the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election as a hedge against possible rule changes under a Democratic administration.. Just 20% of ConocoPhillips’ Permian Basin acreage is on federal land in New Mexico, while the company expects to receive permits within a month for its Willow project along Alaska’s North Slope, “in which case we wouldn’t be exposed” to changes, Macklon said.","In July it agreed to buy land from Kelt Exploration Ltd in Canada’s Montney shale oil play, in a $375 million deal. The 140,000 acres in British Columbia are adjacent to ConocoPhillips’ own Montney lands.","Asked whether it would consider a purchase in an area where it does not already operate, Macklon said yes, but the preference is for assets “we know and understand well.”"
