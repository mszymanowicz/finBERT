The halt on the ammunition and handgun sales will come into effect when current inventory is sold out.",Kroger had sold guns in 43 of its Fred Meyer stores in the Pacific Northwest and Alaska before announcing in March 2018 that it would exit the firearms business.,The retailers’ latest moves sparked immediate reaction from groups on both sides of the gun control debate.,"“The tide is turning,” said Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action, a gun control advocacy group. The announcements “send a strong cultural signal that when lawmakers don’t protect their constituents, companies will protect their customers.”","The National Rifle Association (NRA), a pro-gun group with deep political ties, said Walmart was succumbing to pressure from “anti-gun elites.”","“Lines at Walmart will soon be replaced by lines at other retailers who are more supportive of America’s fundamental freedoms,” it said. It did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Kroger move.","Walmart said its latest actions would reduce its share of the ammunition market from around 20% to a range of about 6% to 9%, and would trend toward the lower end of that range over time.","U.S. gun and ammunition stores had total sales of about $11 billion last year, of which 19% was ammunition, according to market research firm IBISWorld.",The move reflects growing corporate activism on guns.,"Walmart, like rival Dick’s Sporting Goods, had previously ended sales of assault rifles and raised the minimum age for gun purchases to 21.","Bank of America last year said it would no longer lend to companies making military-style firearms for civilians, and airlines Delta and United last year said they were no longer offering discounted rates to the NRA.","The latest move will leave Walmart focused on weapons for hunting, including deer rifles, shotguns and related ammunition.","“The general principle is if we don’t sell the firearm we wouldn’t sell the ammunition,” a spokesman for Walmart told Reuters.","Just last month, Walmart said it would not change its policy on selling firearms even as it took down signs and playable demos of violent video games.","On Friday, McMillon in his letter to employees said he would send letters urging action on “common sense measures” to the White House and the Congressional leadership, calling for debate of the reauthorization of a ban on assault weapons, to determine its effectiveness, as well."

Just last month, it struck a deal with British online grocer Ocado to build highly automated warehouses.","Kroger Chief Executive Officer Rodney McMullen told Reuters that the non-exclusive partnership with Nuro, announced ahead of the company’s annual shareholder meeting on Thursday, will help shape the grocer’s strategy for giving shoppers at its 2,800 stores in 35 states “anything, anytime and anywhere.”","“It’s one more piece of that puzzle,” McMullen said of the Nuro test.
