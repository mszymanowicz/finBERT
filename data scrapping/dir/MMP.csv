A write off of expenditures related to the project reduced fourth-quarter distributable cash flow by $9 million, an executive said on the call.","The Tulsa, Oklahoma-based pipeline operator had said in 2017 it would build a 60-mile pipeline from Wink to Crane, Texas to supply crude to its large, 275,000-barrel-per-day Longhorn crude pipeline.

The company had followed global commodities trader Trafigura SA and investor Carlyle Group in making plans for export terminals off Corpus Christi.,"A Freeport facility would put Magellan in competition with Enbridge Inc, Kinder Morgan Inc and Oiltanking Partners LP, which have jointly proposed an offshore facility that would load 2 million barrels per day (bpd) onto supertankers 80 miles off Freeport.","Magellan’s potential Corpus Christi terminal would be capable of loading as much as 1.5 million bpd onto supertankers and would have room for up to 20 million barrels of storage capacity, Magellan told Reuters.","The Houston pipeline operator owns a terminal in Corpus Christi’s inner harbor, as well as other undeveloped property that could be used for additional storage tanks to connect to the terminal.","It is in talks with potential customers about the terminal, and has also held discussions about building pipelines between Houston and Corpus Christi and from the U.S. oil storage hub in Cushing, Oklahoma to Houston, the company said.","But the oil flowing to Corpus Christi comes almost exclusively from Texas fields in the Permian Basin and the Eagle Ford Shale, while Freeport pipelines have connections to the U.S. oil storage hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, which holds crude from a variety of basins around the United States, Roles said.","“With all the politics involved, the permitting, I don’t believe more than two of these are going to get built,” Roles said. “We want to be on one that’s successful and has long-term commitments on it.” (Reporting by Collin Eaton Editing by James Dalgleish)"

Other Texas and Louisiana projects have been proposed by companies including Swiss-trader Trafigura AG [TRAFGF.UL] and pipeline operators Enterprise Products Partners LP and Tallgrass Energy LP.","To be sure, Magellan warned that it would take “considerable time” before a final decision on the project is made.","“It’s very competitive ... We’ve got significant interest to date, but we’ll see how it plays out,” said Chief Executive Michael Mears.","U.S. crude production hit a record 11.346 million bpd in August, and exports surged to as much as 3 million bpd in June.","Magellan also said the total cost of its proposed crude oil pipeline from the Permian Basin in West Texas to the Gulf Coast is expected to be about $2 billion with Magellan’s share being about $500 million. Permian production has outpaced pipeline capacity, prompting several new lines to be announced.","Separately, Magellan said volumes on the BridgeTex pipeline, which moves crude from Midland and Colorado City, Texas, to East Houston averaged over 395,000 bpd during the third quarter compared with about 280,000 bpd a year earlier."

But what we don’t know is the full demand,” which would dictate the project’s final cost, Michael Mears, Magellan’s chief executive, said at the Barclays energy conference in New York.","The project cost for the Permian Gulf Coast pipeline will be clear after shippers commit to volume capacity during the so-called open season, Mears said. The bidding process for additional shipper commitments will be launched later this week.","Production in the Permian basin, the biggest oil-producing region in the United States, has outstripped its pipeline transport, sending regional crude prices last month to the lowest levels in six years.","The 600-mile Permian Gulf Coast pipeline is expected to begin operation in mid-2020. Magellan and co-investors Energy Transfer Partners LP, MPLX LP and Delek US Holdings Inc will construct the pipeline.","Magellan said it is also is considering new refined products and crude oil investments in Texas, including additional pipeline, storage and export capabilities.","The Tulsa-based company expects to spend about $2.5 billion from 2018-20 on construction projects currently under way, primarily related to refined products, marine storage and the Permian Gulf Coast project."
