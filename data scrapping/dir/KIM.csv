Morgan advised Weingarten."

The index includes Kimco, Simon Property Group SPG.N, Macerich & Co MAC.N and four other REITs.","Kimco is trading at an implied cap rate of 8.6 percent, Goldfarb said. Cap rates are like bonds; the higher price represents a riskier investment.","The public market is an indicator for private market pricings and usually leads because the ease of selling is greater, according to Scott Crowe, chief investment strategist at CenterSquare Investment Management in Philadelphia.","Shopping centers are undergoing a “permanent repricing” because of online shopping, while cap rates for warehouses used for e-commerce will continue to compress, he said.","“You’re going to see cap rate expansion in retail at this point in time,” Crowe said last week.","CenterSquare recently launched the “REIT Cap Rate Perspective,” which seeks to quantify the valuation gap between the public and private market price of $1.5 trillion in real estate in U.S. REITS and signal the private market’s direction.","CenterSquare began to see data about two years ago in retail that led the asset manager to stop buying traditional retail and private retail real estate, Crowe said.","“We found it really useful in terms of making private real estate decisions,” he said."
