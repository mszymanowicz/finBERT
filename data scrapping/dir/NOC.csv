Representatives for the two Republicans, who both objected to Biden’s certification, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.","The announcements are a sign that some corporate donors, which typically spread their money widely around Capitol Hill, are re-assessing their strategy after supporters of President Donald Trump attacked the Capitol last week in an effort to prevent Congress from formalizing Biden’s victory.","It is unclear whether their decisions will have a lasting impact. Fundraising activity is currently at a post-election lull in Washington, giving businesses and trade groups some time to figure out their approach.","Few companies have gone as far as Dow Inc, which said it would withhold donations for the Republican lawmakers’ entire terms in office - up to six years for those in the Senate. Others said they would withhold donations temporarily, or suspend giving to Republicans and Democrats alike.",GE’s suspension will last through the end of 2022 and then the employee board that oversees its political action committee will consider requests for support for those lawmakers who opposed certification “on a case-by-case basis.”,"At least five people died in last week’s attack, which also forced lawmakers into hiding for several hours.","When they reconvened, 147 Republicans in the House of Representatives and the Senate voted to challenge Biden’s victory in Pennsylvania or Arizona, even though both states already formally certified the results and election officials say there were no significant problems with the vote.","Those voting yes included the top two House Republicans, Kevin McCarthy and Steve Scalise, and Senator Rick Scott, who as incoming head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee will head efforts to win back the Senate in the 2022 elections. All of their jobs require extensive fundraising. McCarthy and Scalise’s offices did not respond to a request for comment. Representatives for Scott declined to comment.",Amazon said it would discuss concerns “directly with those members we have previously supported” before deciding whether to resume contributions.,"The sheer extent of the Republican opposition will make it difficult for businesses to simply cut off those who voted against certifying Biden’s victory, said a senior Republican business strategist, speaking on condition of anonymity. Roughly two-thirds of all House Republicans, including seasoned legislators and vocal Trump partisans, supported the challenge.","Business groups will be watching closely over the coming weeks to see whether those Republicans make gestures to re-establish a sense of normalcy, such as attending Biden’s inauguration, the strategist said.","“Each of those people are going to be scrutinized,” the strategist said. “Are they all going into the bucket of ‘no contributions’? I would be shocked if they all get put in.”","A growing list of companies, including","Copper giant Freeport-McMoRan Inc, Ford Motor Co, Microsoft Corp, American Airlines, Alphabet Inc’s Google, Facebook Inc, Goldman Sachs, BP Plc, Smithfield Foods Inc and Union Pacific Corp said they would temporarily suspend donations to Democrats and Republicans alike.","Late Monday, Northrop Grumman became the first major defense contractor to temporarily halt all donations. “We are pausing political action committee giving and evaluating the way forward,” a spokesman said.","Trade associations, among the biggest donors in Washington, are moving more slowly.","The National Association of Beer Wholesalers, the National Association of Auto Dealers, and the American Bankers Association said they would re-assess their contribution strategy. Other top donors, including the National Association of Homebuilders and the National Association of Realtors, said they have yet to make a decision.","Several analysts said the boycott may not be permanent, as the need for access on Capitol Hill might ultimately outweigh the risk of being seen as an underwriter of those who weaken U.S. democracy.","“It’s very easy to suspend campaign contributions two months after an election. The question is whether these policies will remain in effect,” said Stanford University law professor Nathaniel Persily."

But Bush said Northrop is “fully committed” to the project’s success.,The telescope’s development costs of $8.8 billion have exceeded an $8 billion funding cap set by Congress. NASA is asking lawmakers to approve funding to cover the $800 million difference.,"Asked by the committee’s Republican chairman, Lamar Smith, whether he would agree to pay the extra $800 million instead of the taxpayers, Bush said “that would be the wrong approach” and would “significantly impede and impair the relationship between NASA and Northrop Grumman.”","Having the company pay “would be justified given the poor record and given the poor management,” Smith responded.","“I only wish that Northrop Grumman was willing to take responsibility and show a little bit more good faith, both to the taxpayer and for the cost overruns,” Smith added.","A June 27 report by an independent review board set up by NASA described “human-induced errors” and other problems that forced a postponement of the planned launch by 29 months from October 2018 to March 2021 - at a cost of an extra $1 billion. The problems included loose nuts and bolts, the wrong solvent being used to clean propulsion vales and improper test wiring that caused excess voltage to be applied to devices called transducers.","“Having been delayed 14 years, and now costing 19 times the original cost, is just probably the worst example of bad management any of us have ever seen or heard about,” Smith told Reuters in an interview.","During the hearing, Republican Representative Dana Rohrabacher noted that other deserving NASA missions may have lost out on funding because of this project’s ballooning costs.","“Your group that was handling this, and your company, failed. They failed us, and they failed the American people. ... The question is, is it worth all those other projects that we’ve been unable to fund in this committee because you have failed your job?” Rohrabacher asked Bush."

Northrop has already responded to Japanese requests for information (RFI) and has held preliminary talks with Japanese defense industry officials, he said.","Northrop Grumman has provided Japan with a menu of technologies it could contribute to the next-generation F-3 fighter project, but not yet made any specific proposals to Japan, the sources said.",The sources declined to be identified because they are not authorized to speak to the media.,The company’s bid would compete with Lockheed Martin proposals that include a hybrid stealth design based on its F-35 Lightning II and F-22 Raptor. The F-22 beat Northrop’s YF-23 Black Widow demonstrator to win the lucrative U.S. Advanced Tactical Fighter contract in 1991.,"The F-22 is banned for export and is only used by the U.S. Air Force. But Japan has ordered 42 F-35s to upgrade aging fighters whose designs date back to the 1970s. It plans to increase that order, including purchases of the vertical take off and landing (VTOL) versions suitable for aircraft carrier operations.",Northrop Grumman was unable to immediately comment.,Both it and Lockheed Martin would need U.S. government approval to offer sensitive aircraft technology to Japan.,"Tokyo has also sought offers from Boeing Co, which makes the F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, and has sounded out European defense companies about possible cooperation, including BAE Systems PLC, which is a leading member of the consortium that built Europe’s Typhoon high-altitude interceptor.","The British company has also provided Japan’s Ministry of Defence with a list of technology it could contribute, a fourth defense industry source said.","Bringing in foreign partners would allow Japan to spread development costs, estimated to be around $40 billion, and give it access to technology it would otherwise have to develop from scratch.","Tokyo, however, wants to ensure Japanese companies provide the F-3’s avionics and flight hardware, which include communication and navigation systems, radar, and engines that are being developed by IHI Corp.","The Japanese government has so far issued three RFIs for the F-3 and sent letters to the British and United States governments outlining its requirements in more detail, sources have told Reuters.",Any foreign company picked for the F-3 project will work with Japanese defense contractor Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Ltd.,"The maker of the A6M Zero, which battled Grumman Hellcats and Wildcats over the Pacific in World War Two, last developed a jet fighter two decades ago. That plane, the F-2, was a joint effort with Lockheed Martin.","Mitsubishi Heavy also assembles Japan’s F-35s, a program to which Northrop Grumman contributes components such as wing skins. The U.S. company’s other military aircraft include the E-2 Hawkeye airborne early warning aircraft and the Global Hawk unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), both of which Japan has purchased.","Northrop Grumman built the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber and is developing the new B-21 stealth bomber for the U.S. Air Force. Its last fighter aircraft was the F-14 Tomcat, retired in 2006 from the U.S. Navy but still in service with the Iranian air force.","For now, it is unclear when Japan will begin F-3 development, as Japanese officials juggle spending priorities and military planners mull designs. Defence officials would like to introduce the aircraft in the mid-2030s to deter Chinese and Russian airspace intrusions.","With many of the engineers who designed the F-2 reaching retirement age, Japan, according to a fifth source familiar with Japanese defense industry capabilities, will need to get the project under way within the next two years to ensure it still has the skills to build a fleet of advanced stealth jets."
