Companies “do not face sanctions risk for engaging in transactions with COSCO, its non-blocked” subsidiaries or affiliates, the fact sheet said.","“For anyone not subject to U.S. sanctions jurisdiction it will ultimately come down to a question of risk appetite: Just because the U.S. authorities have the power to list people on this basis does not necessarily mean that they will do so in every instance,” said Anna Bradshaw, a sanctions lawyer and partner with Peters & Peters Solicitors LLP."
