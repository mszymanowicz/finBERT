The same-store sales for the second quarter also missed estimates.,"Under Ellison, who took charge in July, the company has also eliminated four senior positions, while creating two new senior roles for stores and supply chain. On Wednesday, Lowe's named David Denton, a former executive of CVS Health CVS.N, as its chief financial officer.","“We have work to do ... Although it’s never good to be behind, our current position presents significant upside potential for Lowe’s,” Ellison said on a post-earnings call.","Lowe’s said it would shut 99 stores of hardware and garden chain Orchard Supply by the end of the fiscal year, leading to between $390 million and $475 million in charges in the second half.",It also said it would seek to cut back on inventory of slow-selling product lines and reinvest in faster-moving goods.,"At the same time, its forecasts for sales to grow about 4.5 percent in fiscal 2018 and sales at stores open at least a year about 3 percent were reduced from previous targets. It also cut its full-year profit forecast by 90 cents to $4.50-$4.60 per share to account for the Orchard closures and inventory cuts.","“These may be appropriate steps but likely will come with further investment and earnings pressure,” Wedbush Securities analyst Seth Basham said.","Excluding one-time items, the company earned $2.07 per share, topping estimates of $2.02. Net sales rose 7 percent to $20.89 billion, beating expectations.","In the second quarter, same-store sales rose 5.2 percent helped by capitalizing on the delayed demand for spring time goods but missed expectation of a 5.34 percent increase."

The company’s stock price had been moving higher most of the morning and continued to climb after Ackman’s disclosure. The stock ended trading up 10.4 percent at $94.69 on the New York Stock Exchange.,"One day earlier Lowe's announced top management changes, naming J.C. Penney JCP.N Chief Executive Marvin Ellison to replace CEO Robert Niblock, who will retire in July.","With Ackman one of the hedge fund industry’s most closely watched activist investors, his stock bets tend to push up shares of companies he invests in, on speculation that he will agitate for boardroom changes.","The record of Ackman's $8 billion Pershing Square Capital Management has been spotty in recent years. Only a week ago he said his funds were finally making money again after chalking up losses earlier in 2018 on the heels of three years of negative returns, spoiled mainly by a bad bet on Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc VRX.TO.",In January Ackman announced an investment in Nike Inc NKE.N which he exited months later with a $100 million profit. He also exited his long-standing bet against Herbalife and said his firm had made a new investment in United Technologies Corporation UTX.N. Longstanding investments in Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc CMG.N and Automatic Data Processing ADP.O have contributed to recent gains.,"With Lowe’s, Ackman supports Ellison and is not seeking a board seat for Pershing Square, said a person familiar with the investor’s thinking who was not authorized to discuss it publicly. Earlier this year Lowe’s reached a settlement with hedge fund D.E. Shaw Group, which has a roughly $1 billion stake in Lowe’s, to put three new directors on the board.","At the start of 2018 Ackman told clients that he would focus more on the investment business instead of marketing his roughly $8 billion hedge fund. Wall Street took that as a signal that one of the industry’s highest-profile investors was planning to stay out of the limelight. But as Pershing’s returns improved, Ackman has been seen more at conferences and other events.",Ackman quit J.C. Penney’s board five years ago after having tried in vain for years to overhaul the retailer by hiring Ron Johnson as CEO and upgrading the merchandise. He has been following Ellison’s career and had invested in Lowe’s before.,"Ellison, who became J.C. Penney's CEO in 2015, was a senior executive at Lowe's chief rival Home Depot HD.N a decade ago.","In its quarterly results, Lowe’s brushed aside lower-than-expected same-store sales as driven chiefly by cold weather.","A prolonged winter in some U.S. states hit demand for outdoor products at Lowe’s in the February-April period, but the company was optimistic about making up for lost business.","“We are anticipating recovering the majority of the sales miss in the first quarter. ... So that’s what we factored in to maintain our guidance,” Chief Financial Officer Marshall Croom said on a conference call with analysts."

Penney CEO Ellison jumps ship to Lowe's; shares sink,"(Reuters) - J.C. Penney's JCP.N Chief Executive Officer Marvin Ellison is leaving the struggling retailer to join home improvement chain Lowe's Cos Inc LOW.N, the companies said on Tuesday, sending shares in the U.S. department store chain down as much as 8 percent to an all-time low.","Ellison came to Penney in 2014 with a strong reputation honed through 12 years at Lowe's biggest competitor, Home Depot Inc HD.N. Shares of Lowe's gained 3 percent on the news before retreating.",The 52-year-old will take over on July 2.,"At J.C. Penney, Ellison was tasked with stemming a two-year sales decline as the company struggles to stay relevant in a brutal U.S. retail landscape, where customers are increasingly turning to online shopping.","The chain has been among the hardest hit by a collapse in mall traffic, leading to thousands of U.S. stores being closed in the past five years. J.C. Penney’s stock price dwindled to $2.29 per share on Tuesday from $87 a decade ago.","“Marvin Ellison’s departure from J.C. Penney is another signal to investors that the company is distressed,” said Jason Benowitz, a senior portfolio manager with fund managers The Roosevelt Investment Group in New York.",“The captain is not going down with the ship but has chosen instead to save himself.”,Results last week showed J.C. Penney missed same-store sales estimates for the quarter ended May 5 and it cut its full-year profit forecast because of changes to its accounting standards. Shares fell 12 percent on that day.,"Analysts said Ellison had managed to bring about some changes at the retailer, like focusing it on large home appliances, but said it was still trailing far behind others like Macy’s, which is starting to show signs of turning its businesses around.","Macy’s is focusing on upgrading existing businesses, such as its beauty and apparel departments through creative merchandising or adding experiential elements, rather than being distracted by new categories, said Carol Spickerman, a retail analyst.","This embracing of a more agile test-and-learn model by Macy’s is turning out to be more successful than J.C. Penney, which has relied on chain-wide big bets like major appliances.","Analysts also said that without a clear merchandising strategy and no differentiation compared to rivals, J.C. Penney was more vulnerable than Macy’s in apparel.","J.C. Penney said Ellison would stay on until June 1, while they look for a new CEO. He will step down as chairman of the board immediately.",After that a group of four executives including Chief Financial Officer Jeff Davis will take over day-to-day running until a new CEO is appointed.,"Ellison joins Lowe’s at a time it has been losing market share to bigger rival Home Depot. He replaces Robert Niblock, who in March said he was retiring after 13 years on the job.","“While closing the productivity gap with Home Depot will be no small feat, we see the announcement as a favorable development,” Gordon Haskett analyst Chuck Grom wrote in a note."
