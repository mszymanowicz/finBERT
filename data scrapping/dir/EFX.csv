The nationwide settlement was based on Equifax’s alleged negligence, but Frank argued that class members from some states had valuable statutory claims under state data privacy laws. Those class members, he said, should have been represented by separate counsel as a subclass.","The standing and conflict arguments prompted some questions from Brasher, who seemed intrigued by the assertion that class counsel must provide proof of standing, beyond mere allegations in a complaint, to be certified. He also pressed Canfield and Balser about Frank’s argument that the trial judge, U.S. District Judge Thomas Thrash of Atlanta, should have ordered subclasses. Canfield and Balser both said Thrash, who has significant experience overseeing data breach class actions, determined there was no intraclass conflict and thus no need for subclasses.","By far the most animated moments of the argument, which stretched for more than an hour on Zoom, concerned the draft opinion written by class counsel at the request of the trial judge. As I've explained, Thrash originally granted approval of the Equifax settlement in an oral order he delivered from the bench after a fairness hearing in December 2019. At the hearing, the judge asked class counsel to memorialize his decision in a proposed order.","That draft opinion, as Canfield acknowledged to the 11th Circuit in Tuesday’s argument, was circulated to Equifax counsel but not to objectors. The draft was not published in the case docket.","Thrash eventually issued a 122-page written opinion that was harshly critical of Frank and other objectors. In early 2020, Frank litigated unsuccessfully before a motions panel at the 11th Circuit to force disclosure of the draft opinion, suggesting that Thrash may have simply adopted an opinion ghostwritten by class counsel.","Early in Tuesday's argument, 11th Circuit Judge Martin asked Frank about the appellate court's precedent in In re Colony Square, in which the 11th Circuit in 1987 said it ""strongly disapproved"" of a federal bankruptcy judge signing his name to orders ghostwritten by an insurance company – but nevertheless upheld the orders.","“We tell district judges not to do this, and then we let them do it,” Martin said.","Her panel colleagues, however, seemed more troubled by the possibility that Thrash adopted a ghostwritten opinion that was not shown to objectors or entered in the public docket.","“Why in the world shouldn’t the draft order have been published on the district court docket?” Grant abruptly asked Canfield. When Canfield said class counsel would have stipulated to publication of the ex parte order if objectors had agreed not to use it as ammunition on appeal, a skeptical Grant replied, “Is that the rule, that if an order would cause a party to object, the court doesn’t need to enter it on the record?”","Canfield argued that trial courts in the Northern District of Georgia routinely request ex parte draft opinions from the winning side. Brasher, who was a trial judge in Alabama before his elevation to the 11th Circuit, responded, “I was a district court judge and I got those proposed orders – but the other side was always copied.”",Brasher later told Frank it was “concerning” that Thrash did not show the proposed order to objectors before issuing an opinion that included a far more scathing critique of the Equifax objectors than the trial judge’s ruling from the bench.,"Even Equifax counsel Balser conceded that the ex parte opinion was a problem. “I know this is an issue that’s on the panel’s mind,” he said. “And Judge Martin, you’re right. The court has said repeatedly you shouldn’t do this.”","None of the judges, though, seemed to bite at arguments by Frank and Isaacson that settlement approval should be reversed if the trial judge relied on a ghostwritten opinion. Canfield and Balser, meanwhile, argued that regardless of who drafted the written opinion, Thrash had already approved the settlement from the bench, signaling independent decision-making.","Equifax counsel Balser declined to provide a statement. Isaacson, who took great umbrage in his rebuttal to Balser’s comment that some Equifax objectors “have been found to have engaged in extortionate efforts,” said by email ” that it was “disappointing that a lawyer of Mr. Balser’s stature would stoop to ad hominem attacks.” Isaacson, who has recently prevailed for objectors in two 11th Circuit rulings said he was encouraged by the judges’ attention to the undisclosed ex parte draft opinion.","Pro se objector Huang said oral argument confirmed that plaintiffs have not established a constitutional right to sue. Frank said by email that the court should impose consequences for Thrash’s conduct. “No appeals court has ever permitted a district court to do anything close to what the district court did here without reversing, especially in the class action context,” he said.","Class counsel said the deal should be upheld. “We remain confident that the 11th Circuit will affirm the final approval order in all respects, and we look forward to implementing this historic settlement,” they said in an email statement.","Opinions expressed here are those of the author.

Listen to the On the Case podcast.,"Edelson sowed the wind. On Monday, he reaped the whirlwind.","Both Equifax and class counsel filed briefs asking the 11th Circuit to reject Edelson’s amicus filing. Equifax’s lawyers at King & Spalding argued that Edelson is not a proper amicus because, among other things, he represented the city of Chicago in the underlying litigation and may himself be a member of the class of nearly 150 million Americans whose data was compromised in the 2017 Equifax hack. Class counsel from Doffermyre Shields Canfield & Knowles, DiCello Levitt Gutzler and Stueve Siegel Hanson accused Edelson of “touting false assertions” and failing “to disclose key facts that would reveal he is a partisan litigant.""","The tone of both briefs is scornful. Equifax derided Edelson’s “Monday morning quarterbacking” and “biased, hyperbolic rhetoric.” Class counsel suggested that Edelson’s own representation of Chicago undercuts his amicus arguments that the class action deal failed to account for claims by class members from states with big statutory penalties for privacy breaches. Chicago, class counsel said, settled with Equifax for “just $1.5 million” after U.S. District Judge Thomas Thrash approved the consumer class action, with Edelson “abandoning any claim for additional restitutionary relief,” despite the city’s assertion of statutory claims. In that context, class counsel said, Edelson’s criticism of the class settlement “should be of no persuasive value.”","Edelson said by email that he was expecting no less than what Equifax and class counsel dished out in the new briefs. “We knew that they would go after me personally,” he said. “They told us that before we filed.”","But what the Equifax and class counsel briefs don’t address, Edelson said, is his concern that the Equifax settlement reinforces cynicism about a system that rewards class counsel but delivers only pennies on the dollar to class members whose interests are at stake. “Given the prominence of the (Equifax) case,” Edelson said, “it will take a decade to undo the reputational damage done to plaintiffs’ work in the court of public opinion.”",Class counsel Amy Keller of DiCello Levitt declined to comment beyond the filing and Equifax counsel David Balser of K&S did not immediately respond to an email query.,"Edelson is certainly right that the Equifax case has attracted far more public attention than class actions usually do, mostly because of erroneous reports soon after Equifax settled that class members could claim a $125 cash payout even if their data had not been misused. In fact, that $125 payout was not a guarantee but was instead a cap on prospective cash recovery available only to plaintiffs who could prove they were already receiving credit monitoring services. (The actual payout, which has not yet been disclosed, will depend on how many class members have made claims on the alternative recovery fund.) Confusion over the cash payout led to a New York Times op-ed criticizing the Equifax settlement and an unprecedented online campaign to facilitate objections to final approval of the deal.","In his proposed amicus brief, Edelson laid blame for the confusion on class counsel. They rejected that assertion in their new brief, which contends that lead plaintiffs’ firms in the case acted quickly to clarify misleading media reports and assure that class members understood what relief they were entitled to under the terms of the deal.","In fact, class counsel asserted in Monday’s filing, Edelson himself contributed to public misunderstanding about the terms of the Equifax settlement. Edelson was quoted in the New York Times piece criticizing the deal, the brief said, and also “engaged with” class action objectors’ counsel Ted Frank of the Hamilton Lincoln Law Institute in an “anti-settlement Twitter campaign.” When Judge Thrash granted final approval of the settlement in 2019, class counsel said, he called out Frank and other critics of the deal for spreading misinformation. (Frank has suggested at the 11th Circuit that class counsel actually ghostwrote Judge Thrash’s final opinion, including the judge’s harsh words about him. But that’s another story.)","Edelson’s amicus brief, class counsel said, may just be an attempt to mount a collateral attack on Thrash’s criticism of Frank, whom Edelson once represented in a Telephone Consumer Protection Act case.",Edelson didn’t include a point-by-point rebuttal to class counsel’s arguments in his email response to my query on their brief. Frank said via email that the class counsel brief opposing Edelson’s amicus filing is “entirely consistent with their repeated abusive tactics throughout this litigation of trying to distract from the issues with false ad hominem attacks.”,"Judges on the 11th Circuit have recently shown their willingness to disrupt class action. In a 2019 decision in a data breach case against Home Depot, the court barred risk multipliers for plaintiffs’ lawyers when their fees are paid by defendants. And in a ruling just last week, the appeal court abolished incentive awards for lead plaintiffs. Last week’s ruling came in an appeal filed by an objector whose original lawyer was derided by the parties as a “serial objector.” Oral arguments in the Equifax appeal have not yet been scheduled, but it’s definitely a case to watch."

His eponymous firm has had a lead role in some of the biggest cases of the past few years, including a $650 million biometric privacy settlement with Facebook in 2020 and a 2019 jury verdict of more than $900 million in a Telephone Consumer Protection Act case against the telemarketer ViSalus. Edelson has a powerful interest, in other words, in the integrity of the class action system.","He claims that Equifax’s $380.5 million data breach settlement undermines public faith in that system, accusing the judge and class counsel of adding to cynicism about the benefits of class actions.",Want more On the Case? Listen to the On the Case podcast.,"Edelson made that assertion in an amicus brief filed Friday at the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, where objectors are challenging final approval of the settlement by U.S. District Judge Thomas Thrash of Atlanta.","Edelson echoed arguments by objectors' lawyers from the Hamilton Lincoln Law Institute that Judge Thrash and class counsel neglected to account for potential damages for class members in jurisdictions with robust statutory penalties for privacy violations, like Utah and the District of Columbia. At the very least, Edelson said, Judge Thrash should have required class counsel from Doffermyre Shields Canfield & Knowles, DiCello Levitt Gutzler and Stueve Siegel Hanson to submit evidence of the range of potential recovery, based on statutory damages, for the nearly 150 million people whose personal information was compromised in the 2017 Equifax breach. Instead, Edelson’s brief argued, class counsel merely asserted that the settlement would avert the prospect that their entire case might be tossed if they could not show concrete injuries from the breach. Judge Thrash, he said, abused his discretion by failing to calculate how much of a discount the settlement imposes on class members.","I emailed class counsel for a response to Edelson’s brief. They did not provide a statement. It’s worth noting that, according to a declaration class counsel filed to bolster their $77.5 million fee request, state regulators – who presumably have an interest in enforcing the statutory penalties cited by Edelson and objectors – had a strong say in the settlement Judge Thrash approved. For his part, Edelson represented the city of Chicago in the data breach litigation against Equifax. (The company, broadly speaking, claimed that plaintiffs could not trace any alleged injuries to the breach of its data safeguards.) Chicago alleged violations of its consumer fraud statute, which carries penalties of up to $10,000 for each offense. The city settled its claims last April for $1.5 million.","Edelson’s amicus brief doesn’t just assert legal arguments about a trial judge’s discretion, though. The filing alleges that the Equifax settlement process eroded confidence that class actions protect consumers. As you may recall, and as Edelson’s brief recounts, early news of the settlement – including the initial, short-form notice to class members – suggested that class members who had not suffered out-of-pocket losses would be entitled either to credit monitoring or a $125 cash payment. Millions of people attempted to sign up for the $125 payment. But in a subsequent notice to the class, class counsel underscored that the cash payment was available only to class members who could prove they already had credit monitoring services – and that $125 was a ceiling, not a guarantee, from a $31 million cash fund for class members without out-of-pocket claims. Edelson’s brief noted that class counsel have not said precisely what individual class members will end up getting from the fund, but objectors have estimated the amount to be just a few dollars.","Confusion about the settlement terms is entirely the fault of class counsel, Edelson’s brief said. And its effects will taint the entire class action bar, he argued. “This case involved an issue that affected nearly every (if not every) adult American,” the brief said. “The whole country was watching. And when the class action bar stepped up to do its part to help right this wrong, our representatives provided inadequate compensation, misleading notice, and an ad hoc and confusing claims process. It seems no understatement to say that, because of what happened here, no class action notices for some time will carry any air of credibility.”","That’s strong stuff – and from a plaintiffs’ lawyer who will almost certainly cross paths in some future case with the fellow class action lawyers whose work the brief slams. In an email, Edelson told me there’s an “unwritten rule in the plaintiff’s bar that we are not supposed to do things like file amicus briefs criticizing settlements or speaking out against bad settlements publicly.” But the Equifax deal, he said, undermines his firm’s push for class action settlements that deliver cash to class members.","“It will undermine public confidence in class actions generally and privacy deals in particular,” Edelson said. “That is the headwind we are fighting against and why we decided to file the brief.”","Edelson is generally no friend to so-called “serial” class action objectors: His firm last year forced a lawyer who had objected to one of his TCPA settlements to agree not to practice in Illinois. He said, however, that he and Ted Frank of the Hamilton Lincoln Law Institute, who is one of the objectors appealing the Equifax deal, “have some overlapping goals, even though we see the broader world very differently.”","Edelson previously represented Frank as the lead plaintiff in a TCPA suit but the two have not joined forces in a class action objection. Frank joked in an email that if the 11th Circuit overturns approval of the Equifax settlement, Edelson could represent a subclass - with Frank as the class representative.","The appeal is Huang v. Spector and Equifax, No. 20-10249 at the 11th Circuit."

Last Thanksgiving, I made the mistake of leaving a baked-from-scratch pumpkin pie in the middle of the kitchen table while the family ate dinner in the dining room. When we went to fetch dessert from the kitchen, the pie was gone. All of the dogs had access. All of them have criminal intent when it comes to pumpkin pie. Obviously, at least one of them (and probably more than one) stole it. But we couldn’t yell at any of the dogs for pie-snatching because we couldn’t know for sure which of them was responsible. That’s just common sense, right? You can’t hold a dog responsible for wrongdoing unless you’re sure the dog has, in fact, caused harm.","What works for pie-thieving dogs does not, however, work for data breach defendants. On Monday, U.S. District Judge Thomas Thrash of Atlanta became the latest judge to reject defense arguments that Americans’ personal information has been exposed in so many different data breaches that it’s impossible to hold any particular corporation responsible for harm to any particular plaintiff. Thrash, who is overseeing multidistrict litigation against Equifax for the 2017 infiltration in which hackers stole the personal information of nearly 148 million (!) Americans, denied the company’s motion to dismiss a class action by consumers who claim to have been victimized.",Want more On the Case? Listen to the On the Case podcast.,"Equifax’s lawyers at King & Spalding actually based their argument on statistics included in a complaint by a separate class of financial institutions suing the credit reporting company over the 2017 breach. The banks’ complaint, citing a 2017 report by the Identity Theft Resource Center, said there were a record-setting 1,579 data breaches in 2017, exposing more than 178.93 billion records. The banks cited the stat to argue that Equifax should have been more careful to protect confidential data, given the prevalence of hacks and identity theft. Equifax’s lawyers attempted to turn the information to their advantage, claiming that consumers in the class action can’t prove their confidential data wasn’t compromised in some other data hack.","“Certainly, no individual plaintiff has alleged (or could allege) facts tying any actual harm to the Equifax breach,” the dismissal motion said. “Importantly, no plaintiff alleges that her (personal identifying information) was not stolen in other data breaches. Given how often data breaches occur, plaintiffs’ attempt to blame Equifax is guesswork at best.” Without tying specific harms to the theft of information from Equifax, the company argued, consumers can’t claim negligence because they can’t establish proximate cause.","Judge Thrash was having none of it. He held it’s enough for plaintiffs to allege, at this stage of the case, that their personal information was exposed in the Equifax hack and that they’ve suffered some form of identity theft or identity fraud. “The plaintiffs need not explicitly state that other breaches did not cause these alleged injuries, since their allegations that this data breach did cause their injuries implies such an allegation,” the judge wrote.","More broadly, he said, it’s just misguided to conclude that no defendant can be liable because others have committed the same alleged wrongdoing. “Allowing the defendants to rely on other data breaches to defeat a causal connection would ‘create a perverse incentive for companies: So long as enough data breaches take place, individual companies will never be found liable,’” Thrash wrote. “The court declines to create such a perverse incentive.”","Judge Thrash’s opinion cited two rulings by U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh of San Jose in previous data breach class actions against Yahoo and Anthem. In both cases, defense lawyers argued that consumers didn’t have standing to sue because they couldn’t trace their alleged injuries back to specific hacks. Judge Koh had no more patience for those arguments than Judge Thrash. Her most extensive discussion was in the Anthem class action, in which she coined the “perverse incentive” phrase. Judge Koh pointed out that the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals considered – and dismissed – a similar “you can’t blame anyone when everyone could be liable” argument in its landmark 2015 ruling in Remijas v. Neiman Marcus, the first decision to hold that hacking victims have standing because of the mere threat of identity theft. The 7th Circuit, Judge Koh said, said that under the common law of torts, defendants claiming someone else could be responsible for their alleged negligence bear the burden of proving it. “No court,” Judge Koh said in her Anthem opinion, “has ever accepted the Anthem defendants' argument in the data breach context.”","When Yahoo’s lawyers nevertheless tried the same play, Judge Koh smacked them down: “Again, the court is not persuaded by defendants' arguments,” she wrote in a 2017 opinion. “Plaintiffs have plausibly alleged that plaintiffs had accounts with Yahoo, that plaintiffs' account information was accessed in the data breaches, and that hackers used plaintiffs' account information to gain access to plaintiffs' Yahoo email accounts … the existence of other potential data breaches or causes for plaintiffs' injuries does not defeat plaintiffs' standing to sue defendants.”","I suppose Equifax could try to revive its proximate cause arguments later in the case, in a summary judgment motion or in opposition to class certification. But at the dismissal stage, it’s becoming clear that judges are not willing to let specific defendants off the hook because others have been just as allegedly negligent."
