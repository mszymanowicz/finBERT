Rizk was CEO of Mack-Cali from 1997 to 1999, and previously led Cali Realty, whose merger with Mack Company created Mack-Cali in 1997.","UDR and Rizk are discussing whether to make an offer for the entirety of Mack-Cali, using debt financing to help fund the deal, two of the sources said.

It argued such a deal would shortchange Mack-Cali shareholders at a time when its turnaround strategy had not been fully implemented.","Bow Street subsequently succeeded in installing four independent directors to Mack-Cali’s board, expanding it to 11 members.","UDR owned 52,070 apartment homes as of the end of September, including 658 homes under development.
