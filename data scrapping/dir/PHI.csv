China Telecom teamed up with Uy and was the only qualified bid.,"Uy’s business empire has enjoyed explosive growth during the Duterte presidency, with the number of firms held by its flagship, Udenna Corp, quadrupling to over 100.","Several ventures include Chinese firms, private and government, with the China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) among those that have benefited from Duterte’s pro-Beijing stance.","The reclusive Uy last year joined Forbes Magazine’s “richest list” in a month when he acquired half of the country’s natural gas reserves, a high-speed ferry company and exclusive rights to sell Ferrari sports cars.","Experts and bankers have told Reuters that Uy has benefited not from Duterte’s intervention, but a perception their close ties would lead to preferential treatment, which also makes him attractive to Chinese firms seeking a Philippines foothold.",A spokesman for Uy in December told Reuters his spending spree showed his confidence in Duterte creating “an even playing field” and Uy had not used their friendship to gain an advantage.,"Meanwhile, DITO said it would not comment on Duterte’s remarks but was committed to a March 2021 launch.",PLDT declined to comment and Globe said it had improved services.
