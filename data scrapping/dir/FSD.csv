Netter, who first began complaining to FSD a year ago, said the fund’s managers have failed to appropriately swap out certain fixed rate securities at a time interest rates are rising.","“Dolphin now resubmits a revised proposal, which it originally had made to FSD in December 2018, designed to close the persistent and sizable market discount to net asset value or, in the alternative, nearly a year later, promptly liquidate the Fund,” Netter wrote to FSD in a letter seen by Reuters.","To ratchet up the pressure on FSD, Netter said he plans to make his letter public for all investors to see.",Mackay Shields LLC subadvises the fund.

Two years ago, Saba Capital Management, the $1.7 billion hedge fund run by Boaz Weinstein, reached a settlement with the fund that included a cash tender offer for 15% of the fund’s outstanding common shares.","One reason for the persistent discount is that this fund, unlike some other similar offerings from Blackstone, Nuveen and Eaton Vance, is that the FSD fund is a perpetual fund with no target date for it to be wound down."
