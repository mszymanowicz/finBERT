You cannot run this business with a short-term liability structure or a balance sheet that is not conservative,” Kelly said in an interview.","“The lessons were hard-learned. I won’t lie to you, but they’ll never be forgotten.”","Known for his focus on managing risk, the 47-year-old Dubliner is a very different character from Ryan, whose highly leveraged bets built but then destroyed a leasing behemoth.","While Ryan’s career was a rollercoaster that saw his fortune destroyed before a punt on budget airline Ryanair rebuilt it, Kelly’s rise has been slow and steady.",His strategy has been to keep the balance sheet strong to swoop on killer deals when times are tough for rivals.,"Kelly noted that AerCap had bought GECAS for less than its assets were worth on GE’s balance sheet, a move that GE said would trigger a $3 billion charge.","“No other company in aircraft leasing has ever done an M&A trade below book (value). Aercap has done it four times. Why are we able to do that? Because of our conservative balance sheet, because it puts us into a position to act when times are tough.”","However, several aircraft transactions have been followed by asset writedowns by the buyer. Industry executives warned there was a risk of further pressure on the value of the assets being bought by AerCap as the coronavirus crisis hammers airlines.","“There’s always a risk ... but you price all that in when you do the transaction,” Kelly said.","He also dismissed any concerns over $25 billion of fresh debt, saying AerCap had kept a coveted investment-grade rating.",That still leaves a leasing monolith roughly three times the size of its nearest rival facing questions over its size.,"Kelly had himself flagged concerns about growing too big at an Airfinance Journal conference in January last year, when he suggested a fleet of about 2,000 jets would be tricky to run.","On Wednesday, he said he was confident AerCap could manage the volume of business without having to push down the price it charges airlines simply to keep up with the fleet turnover.","A significant number of low-value regional jets in GECAS’ portfolio have been placed until the end of their life, and GECAS has switched a significant number of narrowbodies to freight, he said.",All eyes are now on whether the next tier of lessors will be driven towards further consolidation or press regulators to exact concessions.,"After the long road back from predecessor GPA’s downfall, Kelly vaunted AerCap’s credentials as an independent lessor competing with the units of major banks. But other executives said suppliers, airlines and lessors are still digesting the deal.","“It’s a huge market ... There’s plenty of competition out there,” Kelly said. “We’re competing every day against the behemoth of the biggest banks in the world that own aircraft leasing companies.”"

They speculatively ordered extra planes to rent out, before stumbling when markets headed lower.","Most tellingly, as AerCap and GECAS fine-tuned their possible mega-transaction last week, budget carrier Norwegian Air quietly folded its own leasing experiment by cancelling a related order for Airbus jets.","It is not the first time AerCap has taken control of a major competitor under Aengus Kelly, the candid and tenacious CEO who started as an accountant at what was left of GPA.","In 2013, he agreed to buy International Lease Finance Corp, founded by Ryan’s arch rival and fellow leasing pioneer Steven Udvar-Hazy, after it was weakened by the financial crisis.",Much of today’s leasing industry is run from Dublin by GPA veterans. Many lost small fortunes during the company’s downfall and built their reputations on cautious decision-making.,"But experts say risks remain in aircraft leasing, which depends on constant access to competitive funding and staying on the right side of a sometimes brutal industry cycle.","“AerCap are doubling down here; it’s a gutsy move and I sense them thinking ‘we’re too big to fail,’ but a few banks have thought the same,” said a senior industry executive.","Another said the new group, representing one-fifth of the world’s leased fleet, would require tough cost cutting.","For AerCap, the crisis delivers a chance to bulk up in an industry that rewards scale, though much will depend on the price it pays for assets and the risk of future writedowns.","For GE, the move would complete an exit from direct involvement in aircraft finance and leave it focusing on GE Aviation, whose jet engines tend to hold their value for longer than airframes.","GECAS has been in focus for years. In 2019, Apollo Global Management worked on an offer worth up to $40 billion.","The Wall Street Journal, which first reported talks with AerCap, pegged the new deal’s value closer to $30 billion, highlighting the current plight of the airline industry.","“In terms of asset value, it’s probably not the best moment for the seller, but it does take advantage of the fact there’s a lot of liquidity,” Grabowski said.","A new entity combining a fifth of all leased jets could help meet new competition from China, one industry executive said.","It would also remove an umbilical cord between GE and GECAS, a captive in-house financier for its engines.

They speculatively ordered extra planes to rent out, before stumbling when markets headed lower.","Most tellingly, as AerCap and GECAS fine-tuned their possible mega-transaction last week, budget carrier Norwegian Air (NORR.OL) quietly folded its own leasing experiment by cancelling a related order for Airbus jets.","It is not the first time AerCap has taken control of a major competitor under Aengus Kelly, the candid and tenacious CEO who started as an accountant at what was left of GPA.","In 2013, he agreed to buy International Lease Finance Corp, founded by Ryan's arch rival and fellow leasing pioneer Steven Udvar-Hazy, after it was weakened by the financial crisis.",Much of today's leasing industry is run from Dublin by GPA veterans. Many lost small fortunes during the company's downfall and built their reputations on cautious decision-making.,"But experts say risks remain in aircraft leasing, which depends on constant access to competitive funding and staying on the right side of a sometimes brutal industry cycle.",TIMING CONCERN,"""AerCap are doubling down here; it's a gutsy move and I sense them thinking 'we're too big to fail,' but a few banks have thought the same,"" said a senior industry executive.","Another said the new group, representing one-fifth of the world's leased fleet, would require tough cost cutting.","For AerCap, the crisis delivers a chance to bulk up in an industry that rewards scale, though much will depend on the price it pays for assets and the risk of future writedowns.","For GE, the move would complete an exit from direct involvement in aircraft finance and leave it focusing on GE Aviation, whose jet engines tend to hold their value for longer than airframes.","GECAS has been in focus for years. In 2019, Apollo Global Management (APO.N) worked on an offer worth up to $40 billion.","The Wall Street Journal, which first reported talks with AerCap, pegged the new deal's value closer to $30 billion, highlighting the current plight of the airline industry.","""In terms of asset value, it's probably not the best moment for the seller, but it does take advantage of the fact there's a lot of liquidity,"" Grabowski said.","A new entity combining a fifth of all leased jets could help meet new competition from China, one industry executive said.","It would also remove an umbilical cord between GE and GECAS, a captive in-house financier for its engines.

More than a dozen creditors, mostly lessors, had intervened in court to challenge a proposal that would have meant a haircut for them of 99.7%.",The new proposal for lessors is a key step as the airline looks to win creditors’ approval for its restructuring.,"The proposal seeks to address lessors’ concerns about their forward commercial agreements and the viability of the airline’s business after recapitalisation, according to the document, which comprises slides describing the plan.","Under the revised proposal, AAX said lessors are expected to recover at least 60% of what they are owed.","A person familiar with the matter said the airline deemed the earlier description of the debt haircut inaccurate as they “excluded returns from ongoing leases”, referring to recovery of rental losses and outstanding debt.",AAX urged lessors to agree to a “pre-packaged lock-up” deal to expedite the restructuring process.,"The person, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter, said the airline wanted to lock in terms of the deal with lessors before convening a creditors meeting to vote on the restructuring.","“(It) balances the needs of creditors and new investors without compromising the financial viability of the business plan,” AAX said in the slides.",AAX did not immediately respond to a request seeking confirmation of the proposal.,"Lessors ICBC Leasing, Kayan Aviation, Aviator Capital, Castlelake, Aircastle and Minsheng Financial Leasing did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment. Macquarie AirFinance, BOC Aviation Ltd and AerCap declined to comment.","The revised restructuring plan comes as the Kuala Lumpur High Court on Friday allowed AAX to convene creditor meetings and vote on its restructuring plan, the Edge Financial Daily reported.","The Edge also reported that the court has separated the airline’s creditors into three categories: airport operator Malaysia Airports Holdings Bhd, planemaker Airbus SE and other creditors. The aircraft lessors, for whom AAX has proposed the new plan, will fall in the last category.","The split could give lessors a bigger say in the talks, as Airbus otherwise accounts for most of the debt AAX wants to restructure.",The court has also ordered AAX to convene separate meetings with its different groups of creditors within six months.,"“Lessors have no choice but to go through (with this plan) if they want to recoup their money, however paltry it is,” said Shukor Yusof, head of aviation consultancy Endau Analytics, adding that AAX’s business model needs to be fundamentally reassessed.",BOC Aviation had last year asked the court to dismiss AAX’s restructuring proposal as it ruled out a debt-to-equity swap and gave too much power to Airbus as a creditor. It also said AAX was “hopelessly insolvent.” The airline announced in December plans to raise 500 million ringgit through a rights issue to existing shareholders and a share subscription for new investors after its debt restructuring.
