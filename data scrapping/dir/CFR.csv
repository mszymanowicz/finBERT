The situation is changing day by day, hour by hour, this is the biggest difficulty for any kind of broad solution.”","The scramble for cash bears echoes for many of the financial crisis fallout. Then it was real estate firms hitting the skids, keeping lawyers busy redrafting documentation prepared for stock market launches to allow for rights issues instead.","As of now, most firms are focusing on internal cost-cutting solutions and drawing down credit facilities, two lawyers said.","But they said this was just the first stage and it was only a matter of time before announcements of large distressed, restructuring and rescue deals start hitting the screens.
