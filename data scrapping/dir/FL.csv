I very much hope it will not be a necessary tool in this case,” Schooling Latter said.","Regulators in Britain, the United States and elsewhere want a shift away from Libor after banks were fined a combined $9 billion for trying to rig the rate.","Central banks want to see Libor replaced by “risk-free” rates, like the BoE’s Sonia, which are based on actual market transactions and thus harder to rig. Libor is based on quotes from a panel of banks.","The shift from Libor, a rate used in products like mortgages, company loans and credit cards worth $300 trillion globally as a price reference, is one of the biggest challenges faced by the financial sector.","Schooling Latter said transition to Sonia in the swaps, derivatives, bonds and securitisation markets was going better than many had predicted.","Progress has been slower in loans, which the 50-year old Libor was originally devised for, though “green shoots” are emerging.","“I know there are corporates asking for overnight Sonia referencing loans,” Schooling Latter said.",He welcomed the announcement this week from Natwest bank that it would introduce Sonia-referenced loans this year.,Associated British Ports received consent from its bondholders this month to switch the rate underpinning its 65 million pounds of floating-rate notes due in 2022 from Libor to Sonia.,"“That has established a model that can be used by others. It would be good to see that happening more and more and become something for those who are nervous about it, more comfortable,” Schooling Latter said.","Banks have agree to continue submitting quotes for compiling Libor only until the end of 2021, meaning it could disappear after then, although industry officials say not all outstanding contracts can be amended to use Sonia.","Libor use in new contracts after 2021 could be prohibited if it was no longer “representative” of the market - with knock-on effects on contracts already referencing Libor, Schooling Latter said.",“The market for Libor referenced instruments is going to be really impaired at that point when Libor is found not representative.”

The stock was last up 15 percent at $53 in premarket trading.,"If the gains hold, Foot Locker shares are on track for a five-month high, setting them on course to finish higher in 2018."

For Foot Locker, a tie-up between the e-commerce giant and Nike launched last year has only added to those pressures.","Industry research, however, shows sneaker sales, crucial to Foot Locker’s bottom line, rose 10 percent globally last year and a dog fight between Nike and Adidas has also seen the big brands spending heavily on U.S. sales and marketing.","Sales at the chain’s stores open at least a year dipped 2.8 percent, but that fall was smaller than the decline of 3.6 percent analysts were expecting, according to research firm Consensus Metrix.","Net sales at the New York-based retailer rose 1.2 percent to $2.03 billion, beating analysts’ expectations of $1.96 billion.","“These strong results were led by branded assortments from Nike and Adidas as well as the resurgence of ‘90s influenced brands like Champion and Fila,” Chief Executive Officer Richard Johnson told a post-results call with analysts.","Foot Locker has been revamping its own strategy by setting up stores outside malls, selling relevant and popular products quickly and striving to control inventory more tightly.","The company singled out Nike’s Air Max 270, Max 2.0 and Nike Tuned Air as among its top selling brands and reiterated that it expected to return to growth of comparable store sales this year.","That reflects a booming market in luxury sneakers that has drawn in high-end brands such as Kering's PRTP.PA Gucci, Prada 1913.HK and Balenciaga and seen price tags for limited editions soar.","“The flow of premium product continues to improve, with increasing breadth and depth in the most sought after styles from our key vendors,” Johnson said.",Analysts said the results bode well for Nike in particular.,Telsey Advisory analyst Cristina Fernández said that new product flow from vendors could lead to positive comparable sales in the second quarter.,"The company’s income dipped to $165 million share in the quarter ended May 5, from $180 million, a year earlier.","Excluding items, however, the company earned $1.45 per share, beating analysts’ average estimate by 20 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.","Foot Locker's shares were up 15.7 percent at $53.68 in morning trading, while peer sports good retailer Hibbett Sports Inc's HIBB.O shares fell 14 percent after posting quarterly results that missed estimates."
