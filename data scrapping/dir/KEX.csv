Under his current role as chief administrative officer, Hart was responsible for matters ranging from legal and environmental affairs to corporate real estate, government affairs and corporate communications.","Under the leadership transition effective May 20, Munoz will take on the role of executive chairman. The role of chief administrative officer will not be replaced."
