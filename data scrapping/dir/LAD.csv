Average gross profit per new vehicle jumped 33% to $2,910 in the first quarter ended March 31, while average gross profit per used vehicle rose 9% to $2,307, Lithia said.","“New vehicle margins may remain elevated in the near-term due to continued microchip and other supply chain shortages,” Chief Operating Officer Chris Holzshu said on a post-earnings call.","The company earned an adjusted profit of $5.89 per share, smashing the Refinitiv estimate of $4.76. On Tuesday, rival AutoNation Inc had reported a quarterly adjusted profit that almost tripled.","Lithia’s total revenue surged 55% to $4.34 billion, compared with estimates of $3.91 billion.","The company’s shares rose about 2% to $381.44 in afternoon trade, adding to the about 30% gain this year.","Lithia said it was running ahead of its schedule to hit a target of $50 billion in annual revenue as part of a five-year growth plan, that includes acquisitions, unveiled in July last year.","“With a record $6.5 billion of expected annualized revenue acquired in the first nine months of our five-year plan, we are well ahead of schedule,” said Chief Executive Officer Bryan DeBoer.","Earlier this month, Lithia bought Troy-based auto dealer The Suburban Collection, adding its 56 auto dealerships and an expected $2.4 billion in annualized revenue.",AutoNation has also predicted more consolidation among U.S. auto dealers as buyers increasingly move online.

He declined to say whether talks were ongoing or name the companies he was interested in, but said they had good coverage of the central and southeastern parts of the United States.","Lithia has said it plans to further expand this year by acquiring smaller, individual dealerships.","“(Consolidation) does seem to make sense and could help focus all of our attention, as well as ensuring a greater pipeline of vehicles, eliminate other people from being able to enter the space and be able to compete for those used vehicles,” DeBoer said.","Six other large U.S. dealership groups are listed: AutoNation Inc, Group 1 Automotive Inc, Asbury Automotive Group Inc, Penske Automotive Group Inc, Sonic Automotive Inc. The companies did not immediately respond to a request for comment.","Auto retailers have begun investing in online sales and vehicle delivery platforms after newer online-only companies like Carvana Co, Shift and Vroom saw growing consumer interest, but still largely earn their money through brick-and-mortar showrooms and repair services.","DeBoer said Lithia’s online sales platform, Driveway, was still in the early stages, but said the company planned to make it available across the United States by the end of the year.","Online sales would allow Lithia, which sells new cars to those up to 20 years old, to expand its customer base, rather than shift current retail customers online, DeBoer said."
