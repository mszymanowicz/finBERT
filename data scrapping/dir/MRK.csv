Researchers presented their findings on Saturday at the 2021 Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections but did not publish a formal report. In the 202-patient study, people who had been symptomatic for no more than 7 days and who were not hospitalized received either the oral antiviral molnupravir or a placebo.

Researchers tracked vaccine responses in 11 survivors of mild COVID-19 and 33 never-infected individuals. In everyone, the vaccines induced the immune system to produce antibodies along with so-called B cells that remember the virus and remain ready to produce new antibodies to fight it, although the magnitude of the B cell response was lower in older people. Those not previously infected ""benefited from both doses,"" with additional antibody and memory B cell increases after the second shot, researchers reported on Saturday on medRxiv ahead of peer review. COVID-19 survivors, however, had significant responses to the first dose with no increase in antibodies or memory B cells after the second dose. Survivors' levels of memory B cells before vaccination correlated strongly with their antibody levels post vaccination, ""indicating that these B cells were the likely source"" of survivors' boosted antibody levels after just a single shot, said coauthor John Wherry of the University of Pennsylvania. This suggests memory B cells will play important roles if antibody levels fall over time, he added. Because memory B cells can be the source of new antibodies with some degree of ""adaptability,"" they might play a role in immunity to variant viruses, he speculated.

Those included at least 100 deaths. Before that, in the first 14 years the drug was on the market, the agency received 34 such reports, including 10 deaths.","Annual U.S. prescriptions of finasteride, as the drug is known, for hair loss increased to over 2.4 million in 2020, more than double the number in 2015, according to health data company IQVIA.","European and Canadian regulators, citing similar reports among men taking finasteride, require a warning of suicidal thoughts on the label, though they note that research has not proved that the drug causes such thoughts. To this day, the U.S. label contains no mention of suicide or suicidal thoughts.","As early as 2009, Merck knew of more than 200 reports of depression, including suicidal thoughts, in men taking Propecia, according to an internal “risk management” assessment from that year. The company decided there were too few reports of serious depression and suicidal behavior and not enough specifics about those cases to warrant more than “routine” monitoring of safety data.","In 2011, two years after the Merck risk analysis, the FDA was weighing a company request to add “depression” to the drug’s label as a potential risk, with no warnings related to suicide. FDA analysts disagreed about adding a warning related to suicide, according to previously unreported government documents. But the regulator ultimately agreed with Merck’s request on the grounds that the number of suicides was lower than one would expect in this group of patients.",Some medical researchers and patient advocates said Merck and the FDA have left American consumers in the dark about potentially life-threatening dangers associated with finasteride.,"“No family should ever have to learn about this after the fact,” said Kim Witczak, a consumer advocate who serves on an FDA advisory panel for psychiatric drugs. She has called for drug companies and regulators to issue stronger warnings after her husband died from suicide in 2003 five weeks after being prescribed an antidepressant for insomnia. Merck “had an opportunity to put suicide on the label, but they didn’t want to do that because it’s all about sales.”","Michael Irwig, an endocrinologist and Harvard Medical School faculty member whose own research has found possible links between finasteride and suicidal behaviors, said Merck’s handling of the risk analysis and the FDA’s inaction keep critical information from the public. Merck “definitely should have provided a more complete picture,” Irwig said.","In a statement to Reuters, Merck said that “the scientific evidence does not support a causal link between Propecia and suicide or suicidal ideation and these terms should not be included in the labeling” for the drug. “Merck works continuously with regulators to ensure that potential safety signals are carefully analyzed and, if appropriate, included in the label for Propecia.”","Merck has said in past statements that Propecia has been prescribed safely to millions of men since the late 1990s. It also has argued in court that “premature hair loss itself, the very condition for which Propecia is prescribed, is associated with low self-esteem, poor body image, and depression.”","In a statement, FDA said it “continues to monitor postmarketing safety data for Propecia.” Overall, the agency noted that the presence of a report in the FDA database “does not mean the drug caused the adverse event” and medical problems may stem from the “underlying disease being treated, caused by some other drug being taken concurrently, or occurred for other reasons.”",FDA declined to comment further about its handling of Propecia and reports related to suicide.,"Merck’s analysis of a potential suicide risk stayed secret in court for over three years -- and only became public after Reuters intervened in the proceeding. The insights in the recently unsealed documents echo findings from Reuters’ 2019 investigation, “Hidden Injustice,” which revealed how U.S. judges routinely allow makers of consumer products to file under seal in lawsuits information that is pertinent to public health and safety. They often do so without explanation, though in most jurisdictions, they are required to provide one.","The Reuters investigation found that hundreds of thousands of Americans have been killed or seriously injured in recent decades by allegedly defective products -- including drugs, cars and medical devices -- while evidence that could have alerted consumers and regulators to potential danger remained hidden.","In granting Reuters’ motion to unseal Merck documents, U.S. Magistrate Judge Peggy Kuo last month ruled that the company’s arguments for continued secrecy “are so weak that they would not overcome even a low presumption of access under the common law.”","In addition to the risk management plan, Kuo unsealed other Merck documents including an internal marketing report from prior to the drug’s launch and some communications with regulators regarding sexual dysfunction. Reuters obtained the FDA documents discussing suicide from a separate online repository maintained by the agency.","In 2010, while reviewing Merck’s proposal to add potential depression risk to Propecia’s label, an FDA safety evaluator recommended also adding a warning for suicidal thoughts and behavior, noting nine suicides and reports of other suicidal behaviors among patients who took finasteride, the FDA documents reviewed by Reuters show.","The reports of suicidal behavior analyzed by Merck and government regulators, known as “adverse event” reports, are filed by consumers, doctors and other members of the public. They are compiled in a public database by U.S. regulators, as well as drug-safety agencies in other countries.","In her November 2010 report, FDA safety evaluator Namita Kothary wrote that the nine suicides were difficult to assess due to incomplete information. “However, we cannot exclude that finasteride may have contributed to the events,” she wrote. Kothary did not respond to requests for comment.","Two other FDA reviewers disagreed. The two physicians -- Amy Woitach and David Kettl -- said the data supported adding depression to the label. Suicidal ideation, however, should be left off because the number of suicidal thoughts, attempts and deaths was “lower than would be expected in this patient population,” according to their December 2010 report. Kettl and Woitach did not respond to requests for comment.","The European Medicines Agency found the relationship between finasteride and depression was hard to assess, but still required a warning about suicidal ideation in 2017, in part because Propecia is not prescribed for a serious condition, according to EMA committee meeting minutes. Doctors and patients generally weigh risks differently for a drug to treat a life-threatening health problem, versus something less severe.","When Health Canada required its warning in 2019, it noted 368 international reports of suicidal events reported in patients treated with finasteride through September 2018. Merck did not respond to questions about these regulatory moves.","The FDA approved Propecia in 1997, and sales climbed steadily through the 2000s, peaking at $447 million in 2010. Soon after, Merck’s patent expired. Overall sales of finasteride have remained strong as cheaper generic versions have hit the market.",The new information regarding a potential suicide risk emerged as a result of longstanding controversy about sexual problems associated with the drugs.,"From the beginning, Merck’s label said Propecia caused sexual dysfunction in nearly 4% of its clinical study participants. However, the 2009 risk management report also shows that the company was aware of reports that those sexual problems continued for some men after they stopped taking the drug.","The FDA in 2012 approved Merck’s request to add a warning of erectile dysfunction that continued after stopping the drug, as well as “libido disorders, ejaculation disorders, and orgasm disorders.” Even so, Merck at the time said scientific evidence did not establish that Propecia caused persistent sexual dysfunction.","The warning prompted more than 1,100 lawsuits against Merck by men alleging their sexual problems lasted long after they stopped taking Propecia. Merck in 2018 agreed to settle most of the lawsuits consolidated before Judge Brian Cogan in Brooklyn federal court for a combined $4.3 million.","Reuters reported in 2019 that prior to the settlement, plaintiffs’ lawyers had alleged that Merck, when revising the drug’s original label, understated the number of men who experienced sexual symptoms in clinical trials and how long those symptoms lasted. The allegation was part of a sealed court brief a Reuters reporter was able to read because of a redaction error. The brief cited internal Merck communications, filed under seal. Reuters intervened in the case, seeking to unseal those communications.",“IMPORTANT POTENTIAL RISK”,"The 2009 risk management report unsealed last month shows that while depression did not emerge as a risk in clinical trials, Merck deemed it an “important potential risk” after the company received 218 global reports of depression from 1998 to 2008. Of those, 10 involved serious depression, and an additional nine involved suicidal behavior.","Merck noted limitations with both the depression reports and the nine involving suicidal behavior. Four provided “insufficient information to allow a full evaluation.” Three of the men had other medical conditions, and for two, the symptoms developed after they stopped taking the drug.","“One fatal report was received from a sheriff’s office and described a male who committed suicide by shooting,” according to the report. “The medical examiner did not think this event was related to Propecia, in addition, the report provided insufficient information to allow for assessment.”",The report contained no additional details about the patient’s identity or the medical examiner’s investigation. Merck did not respond to questions about what steps it took to learn more about the case.,"In its statement to Reuters, Merck said adverse event reports reflect only the opinions of the person who files them. “While consumers and healthcare professionals are encouraged to report adverse events, the reaction may have been related to the underlying disease being treated, or caused by some other drug being taken concurrently, or occurred for other reasons,” the company said.","Dr W. Vaughn McCall, chairman of the Department of Psychiatry and Health Behavior at the Medical College of Georgia, agreed that relying on adverse event reports to monitor drug safety has its limitations. However, he said one of those limitations is that injuries and deaths are often underreported because people aren’t familiar with the process or don’t have time to examine a specific case.","He said there is a plausible biological explanation for a potential link between Propecia and suicidal thoughts. The drug reduces a testosterone-related hormone, which in turn could impact an anti-depressive steroid produced in the body.","“There is a reason to be suspicious,” McCall said."

One such post reads: “Vaccine manufacturer Merck scraps COVID vaccine, saying studies show it’s more effective to get the virus and recover than get the vaccine” (here). Another says: “According to Merck, they have determined it's better to just get the virus and develop antibodies than taking a vaccine. They have abandoned vaccine development in favour of alternative therapies” (here).","These posts appear to have misinterpreted a recent statement from Merck, which announced on Jan. 25 that it was dropping research on V590 and V591, its two candidate vaccines for COVID-19, to focus on therapeutics instead (here).","Citing its reasons for discontinuing development, the American pharmaceutical giant said: “This decision follows Merck’s review of findings from Phase 1 clinical studies for the vaccines. In these studies, both V590 and V591 were generally well tolerated, but the immune responses were inferior to those seen following natural infection and those reported for other SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 vaccines.” (here)","Therefore, Merck was referring to trial data showing its own vaccine candidates having an inferior result compared to a natural immune response to COVID-19. It was not advising against delivery of other COVID-19 vaccines. As it noted in its statement, other candidate vaccines have led to recipients showing a stronger immune response.",Misleading. Merck did not say it is better to catch COVID-19 than get vaccinated.

As part of an investigation of the impact of court secrecy on public health and safety, Reuters published an article in 2019 that examined the basis for those allegations, but many internal Merck documents that might have shed further light on the case remained under seal.","Sunday night, 16 months after Reuters filed a motion asking that those documents be unsealed, U.S. Magistrate Judge Peggy Kuo in Brooklyn rejected Merck’s position that the public had no right to access its documents filed in court, which the company said contained proprietary information.","Merck’s arguments for keeping the documents sealed, Kuo wrote, “are so weak that they would not overcome even a low presumption of access under the common law.” As of Monday, the documents were still sealed on the court docket, despite Kuo’s decision.","In a statement to Reuters, Merck said it “interacted appropriately and transparently with global regulators, including FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration), and with physicians and consumers about the safety profile of Propecia. None of millions of pages produced by Merck suggest otherwise, including the documents unsealed by the Court.” The company previously told Reuters it “stands behind the safety and efficacy of Propecia” and noted that the drug had been prescribed safely to millions of men since the late 1990s.","In its 2019 investigation, titled “Hidden Injustice,” Reuters revealed how U.S. judges routinely allow makers of consumer products to file under seal in their courts information that is pertinent to public health and safety.

Merck in 2018 agreed to settle most of them for $4.3 million, to be divided among the plaintiffs.","Prior to the settlement, plaintiffs’ lawyers cited internal company communications to allege that in revisions to the drug’s original label, Merck understated the number of men who experienced sexual symptoms in clinical trials and how long those symptoms lasted. Merck settled before responding to the allegations in court, and Cogan allowed many of the Merck documents to remain under seal without conducting any analysis of whether they merited secrecy.","After Reuters filed its September 2019 motion to unseal, Merck argued that the material should not be considered “judicial documents” -- which are entitled to a presumed public right of access -- in part because the case had already been settled before the allegations were decided.","Kuo, however, ruled that the presumption of public access does not disappear just because a judge never had a chance to rule on a particular motion. “The continuing presumption of access allows the public to see what is going into the sausage factory, even if a particular sausage is never made,” Kuo wrote.",The judge ordered that all the documents sought by Reuters be unsealed.

Those allegations are contained in court filings that had been intended to be filed under seal.","Federal District Judge Brian Cogan has allowed Merck to keep secret internal company documents in litigation brought by Propecia users against the company.

Those are the documents the Reuters motion seeks to make public.","“This is a case of tremendous importance that has been sealed without on-the-record findings explaining that sealing,” Reuters argued in its motion to intervene in the case. “The First Amendment precludes such an outcome.”",Merck did not respond to a request for comment.

Prior to the settlement, plaintiffs’ lawyers cited internal company communications to allege that in revisions to the drug’s original label, Merck understated the number of men who experienced sexual symptoms in clinical trials, and how long those symptoms lasted. Merck settled before responding to the allegation in court.","Under U.S. law, court filings are presumed to be public, and the bar for secrecy is particularly high for the Propecia documents Reuters seeks to unseal, the motion states, because they are essential to plaintiffs’ claim that the drug causes persistent sexual side effects.","“These documents should not remain under seal absent the most compelling reasons,” Reuters argued.",Read the Reuters motion

Merck argued that it cannot be penalized for failing to issue a warning that the FDA had blocked.","Merck in 2008 submitted data to the FDA suggesting Fosamax might be linked to certain bone fractures, but the FDA denied its warning label proposal. After a task force further studied the issue, the FDA in 2010 ordered manufacturers to revise labels to include a warning, which Merck did.",The plaintiffs contend that the FDA rejected only Merck’s proposed language for the warning that focused on relatively minor stress fractures rather than the more serious fractures they suffered.,"In a decision written by Justice Stephen Breyer, the Supreme Court said a drug manufacturer must show it “fully informed” the FDA of the need for a warning before it was rebuffed and that judges, not juries, must decide whether such lawsuits are preempted, as Merck has claimed. Lower courts now must revisit the case reflecting the Supreme Court’s guidance.",Merck’s shares were flat on Monday.,"Fosamax helps prevent and treat osteoporosis, a condition that can lead to bone fractures, in women who have gone through menopause. But it may increase the risk of fractures in the thigh bone or just below the hip joint, often requiring surgical intervention.",‘FULLY COMMITTED’,"In a statement, Merck said it was pleased with the decision and “remains fully committed to defending these cases going forward and will continue to present evidence that it acted appropriately at all times in regard to the potential risk of atypical femur fractures.”","David Frederick, an attorney for the Fosamax users who sued Merck, said Monday’s decision reaffirms patients’ ability to hold drug companies accountable. “This opinion protects access to justice for injured patients,” Frederick said.","Sales of Fosamax, also available as a generic drug, totaled $209 million in 2018, according to New Jersey-based Merck.","Fosamax users sued Merck, alleging the drug caused them to sustain serious thigh bone fractures and that the company failed to warn of the risk.

Conversely, it may increase the risk of fractures in the thigh bone or just below the hip joint.","Sales of Fosamax, which is also available as a generic drug, totaled $241 million in 2017, according to Merck.","Merck in 2008 submitted data to the FDA suggesting Fosamax might be linked to certain bone fractures, but the FDA rejected its proposal to add a warning label to the medication, according to court papers. After further study of the issue, the agency ordered manufacturers to revise labels to include a warning in October 2010, which Merck did the following January.","Hundreds of Fosamax users sued New Jersey-based Merck alleging the drug caused them to suffer serious thigh bone fractures and that the company failed to warn of the risk. The number of cases has swelled to more than 1,000.","Merck tried to have the cases thrown out, arguing that the FDA’s rejection of its proposed warning label should preempt the lawsuits.","A federal trial court in New Jersey sided with Merck, but in March 2017, the Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals allowed the claims to proceed to trial, saying that a jury could find that the FDA had objected only to Merck’s phrasing of the proposed warning label and might have approved “a properly worded warning” about Fosamax.","Backed by President Donald Trump’s administration, Merck asked the Supreme Court to hear the case, saying the appeals court ruling puts drug companies in an impossible position.","“Even if they cooperate with the FDA, share their safety data, and follow the agency’s direction to ‘hold off’ on adding label warnings, they still cannot escape costly, burdensome tort litigation complaining about those labels,” Merck said.","(Corrects paragraph 8 to show lower court ruling was in March 2017, instead of March 2018)"

But it works. It’s amazing that we’re going to be bringing these drugs to the majority of patients with lung cancer in the first-line setting,” Herbst added. “Why would you wait and not give someone immunotherapy up front?”","Bristol-Myers’s combination therapy significantly stalled disease progression versus standard chemotherapy in newly-diagnosed advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) for patients with a high tumor mutational burden (TMB), a potentially important new biomarker for identifying those most likely to benefit from immunotherapy.","But overall survival is considered the gold standard by doctors and investors, giving Keytruda a clear leg up.","The Keytruda plus chemotherapy regimen was approved as an initial, or first-line, treatment for advanced NSCLC patients based on earlier data from a small study. But many clinicians wanted to see validation of a survival benefit in a large trial.","“We were all waiting to see a definitive Phase III study that showed very clear cut results,” said Dr. Leena Gandhi, the study’s primary investigator and director of thoracic medical oncology at NYU Langone in New York.","Keytruda and Opdivo have piled up approvals for advanced cancers, such as for melanoma and bladder cancer. But those drugs and rival immunotherapies from Roche and AstraZeneca are jockeying for pieces of the largest lung cancer market, especially the coveted newly-diagnosed setting.","There are more than 200,000 new cases of NSCLC each year in the United States alone, with about half at advanced stage at the time of initial diagnosis.","In the Merck-sponsored trial of more than 600 patients called Keynote-189, median overall survival was 11.3 months for chemotherapy, about what was expected. After 12 months, 69.2 percent of patients in the Keytruda group were alive compared with 49.4 percent for chemotherapy, researchers reported.","“We don’t know how long their survival is going to be and we’re excited about that,” said Gandhi.","The differences would likely have been more pronounced, but many patients in the chemotherapy group were given Keytruda or a similar drug once their disease progressed.","Keytruda, with a list price of about $13,500 a month before discounts or rebates, was given every three weeks with a standard chemotherapy regimen. It can be given for up to 24 months for those without disease progression, Merck said.","Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical and scientific officer for the American Cancer Society, called both trials “incredibly important studies.”","“I worry about cost. A lot of people won’t be able to afford these drugs,” Brawley said.",There was a small increase in acute kidney injury in the Keytruda group compared with chemotherapy alone. There were also three treatment-related deaths from pneumonitis among Keytruda patients.,"In the study called CheckMate-227, 43 percent of patients with high TMB who received Opdivo and low-dose Yervoy experienced no disease progression after one year versus 13 percent in the chemotherapy group. There was preliminary evidence of a likely survival benefit but it was too early to determine that, researchers said.",The overall response rate - those with significant tumor shrinkage - was 45 percent for the immunotherapies versus 27 percent for chemotherapy.,"Dr. Matthew Hellman of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, who led the study, and others said it was a validation of the TMB biomarker.","“Maybe we can look at the TMB and it can further personalize therapy,” said Herbst.","In both studies, positive results were not dependent on cancer cell’s levels of PD-L1, a marker of inflammation that has been commonly used with drugs like Keytruda and Opdivo to help predict patient responses, with higher PD-L1 levels believed to lead to greater efficacy.","“This is great that there’s new options and improved outcomes” for patients with lung cancer, Hellman said."
