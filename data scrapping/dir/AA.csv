He then argued in vain with others in the administration, including Vice President Dick Cheney, against more cuts that he felt could fuel budget deficits and hurt the economy.","He also earned a reputation as a loose cannon as Treasury secretary with comments that at various times infuriated members of Bush’s inner circle, fellow Republicans in Congress, Wall Street, Latin American governments and others.","It was Cheney, his friend dating to the 1970s in President Gerald Ford’s administration and had recruited O’Neill into the Treasury job, who told him that he was fired. O’Neill said Cheney had asked him to say his departure was his own decision, but O’Neill refused.","“I’m too old to begin telling lies now,” he said.","History bore out his concerns over the Bush tax cuts, which along with the costs of Bush’s wars in Iraq and Afghanistan contributed to soaring U.S. budget deficits in subsequent years.","Regarding Iraq, O’Neill said Bush’s team had decided on a course of war which it then tried to justify by touting the threat posed by Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein’s weapons of mass destruction.

It was about finding a way to do it.”","Asked in 2008 whether he felt bitter about his time in the Bush administration, O’Neill told the New York Times: “No. I’m thankful I got fired when I did so that I didn’t have to be associated with what they subsequently did.”",During his stint as Treasury secretary O’Neill outraged congressional Republicans by calling one of their tax cut measures “show business.” He annoyed others in the administration by telling lawmakers that Bush’s signature tax cut drive was not likely to boost the economy in the short term.,"He dismissed stock, bond and currency traders as “people who sit in front of flickering green screens” whose jobs he could master in “a couple of weeks.” Brazil’s government protested after O’Neill worried publicly that money lent to Latin American countries would vanish into Swiss bank accounts.",He also irked Wall Street with overly optimistic assessments of the economy including an errant forecast after the 2001 attacks that the stock market would swiftly bounce back. His comment that the administration was not interested in pursuing a strong-dollar policy rattled global currency markets.,"O’Neill was born on Dec. 4, 1935, in St. Louis to a family of modest means. After college, he began his career in government in 1961, working for the Veterans Administration.

It rose 14.4 percent last week, when U.S. sanctions on Rusal, the world’s second-biggest aluminum producer, sharply drove up aluminum prices.",Aluminum prices hit their highest level since 2011 this week.,"Investors’ focus is likely to be on the companies’ outlooks, which analysts said could be stronger than expectations given the jump in aluminum and steel prices.","If Alcoa uses the same type of analysis as previously, said David Lipschitz, senior analyst for metals and mining at Macquarie Capital in New York, “My guess is ... their numbers would have to go up if they do it off of what (the spot aluminum price) is today.”","He rates Alcoa “outperform,” though he said plenty of uncertainty remains over the longer-term impact of the sanctions on the market.","The quarterly results could provide among the first comments from companies that are likely to benefit from the tariffs or sanctions, though Lipschitz said the benefit of tariffs for Alcoa is less certain because of its operations in Canada.","Last month, U.S. President Donald Trump moved to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, with initial exemptions for Canada and Mexico. The United States has since granted temporary exemptions to the European Union and six other allies.","“With the tariffs and/or quotas we have to wait and see ... there’s a lot of uncertainty around that in terms of how that plays out,” Lipschitz said.","Steel shares have risen this week as well, although they have been volatile since the tariffs’ announcement, given news over which countries might be exempted.","Shares of Steel Dynamics, also due to report after the bell on Wednesday, are up 7.3 percent so far this week, while Nucor, due to report Thursday, is up 6.2 percent. The S&P 1500 steel index, however, is down 4.7 percent since March 1, when Trump announced the tariffs.","“What investors are going to be keenly aware of is what the outlook is for the second quarter,” said Philip Gibbs, analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets. “For Nucor and Steel Dynamics, it’s going to be very good because these companies have a very high spot orientation and we know spot prices ... have gone up a lot since the announcement of the tariffs.”","All three of the stocks also look less expensive relative to the broader market. Alcoa is trading at about 15.7 times forward earnings compared with 16.7 for the S&P 500, according to Thomson Reuters data.",Steel Dynamics is trading at 10.5 times forward earnings and Nucor at 10.9 times.,"For the first quarter, analysts expect earnings for Alcoa of 70 cents a share. Steel Dynamics is expected to report 91 cents a share and Nucor to report $1.10 a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.
