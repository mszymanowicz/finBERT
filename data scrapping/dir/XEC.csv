Its shares also reversed course after the bell and were down about 2%.","Among others posting production knocks: Cimarex Energy Co (XEC.N) forecast a hit of up to 7% to first-quarter volume. Laredo Petroleum Inc (LPI.N) also said well shut-ins and completion delays will reduce first-quarter total oil and gas production by about 8,000 bpd. Its production is starting to return to pre-storm levels, officials said.","Shale's outlook was challenged even before the recent storm and ""will remain difficult"", said Peter McNally, global sector lead for industrials, materials and energy at research firm Third Bridge.","Diamondback forecast full-year oil and gas production of between 308,000 and 325,000 bpd, higher than the 300,300 bpd it produced in 2020 when production was curbed because of pandemic-driven plunges in crude prices.","Occidental, which cut production guidance to reduce expenses, forecast full year oil and gas output to drop from 2020's 1.35 million bpd to an expected 1.14 million bpd in 2021, as it sells assets to pay off debt it took on to acquire Anadarko Petroleum Corp in 2019."

The seller's third-largest shareholder said last week it would vote against the deal.,"Having called for more than a year for options to boost shareholder value, including a possible sale, Kimmeridge Managing Partner Ben Dell said in a statement the investment firm was “pleased to see that Resolute’s management team has finally acted.”","“However, we feel that the proposed purchase price undervalues Resolute,” Dell added in an emailed statement. A spokeswoman for Kimmeridge declined to comment further.","As part of the deal, Resolute shareholders have the option to receive 0.3943 shares of Cimarex common stock, $35 per share in cash, or a combination of $14 per share in cash and 0.2366 share of Cimarex common stock.","For the all-cash offer, the deal represents a 15 percent premium to Resolute’s Friday closing price of $30.49 per share.","Based on 23.16 million Resolute shares, the deal is worth $810.7 million, according to Reuters’ calculation. Including debt, the deal is worth $1.6 billion, Cimarex said.","Monday’s deal adds 35,000 boe/d to Cimarex’s production base. It is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter.","Shares of Cimarex fell about 0.5 percent to $88.28, while those of Resolute, which have been down 3 percent so far this year, rose 14.4 percent to $34.88 in late-afternoon trade."
