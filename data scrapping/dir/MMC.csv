It will continue for the rest of all of our careers.”","Climate change and the culture of remote working are the other top risks cited by companies, Glaser said. Climate is less immediate than cybersecurity because it is developing slowly and its impact, through such catastrophic events as larger wildfires and more powerful hurricanes, will increase over the next five years or more.","Cultural shifts caused by technology are another top risk. Digital capabilities are “table stakes” for insurers to grow, be efficient and “delight” customers. Yet robotics, remote working and artificial intelligence “are going to have dramatic impact on the workplace and on culture,” Glaser said. “So culture is one of these risks.”","A recent report by Marsh & McLennan unit Oliver Wyman predicted at least another year of disruption from the pandemic, despite recent news about vaccine development, Glaser said.","“It’s just very difficult to get hundreds of millions of vaccines available for use in any short period of time,” Glaser said."
