Elliott Management may help put life into GlaxoSmithKline’s (GSK.L) lengthy turnaround. On Thursday the Financial Times revealed that Paul Singer’s fund had built up a “multibillion-pound” stake in the $92 billion drugmaker. The activist is pouncing at a tricky time for GSK Chief Executive Emma Walmsley: her group’s shares trade on just 12 times forward earnings, a discount to peers like AstraZeneca (AZN.L), which is valued at 18 times, despite her plans to revive drug development and separate the pharmaceutical and consumer businesses.","There’s plenty of scope for change. Elliott could ask GSK to cut back on in-house research and development, and spend more on acquisitions to boost the otherwise lacklustre drug pipeline. Singer’s fund could also insist that Walmsley spin off the consumer division, rather than list it and hang on to a stake, a move that might make a takeover of either business easier. GSK’s shares rose 5% after the news. That suggests that if Elliott does make demands, it may be able to count on other shareholders’ support.

Both of those shots were found to be about 95% effective in successful large-scale trials.","Delays and additional trials are not unusual but the Sanofi/GSK announcement highlights the unique set of challenges facing drugmakers in multitasking science, speed and logistics during a pandemic that has crushed global economies.",It also underscores why governments have spread their bets by securing shots from different developers.,"Australia, meanwhile, cancelled the production of a COVID-19 vaccine developed by the University of Queensland and using an adjuvant made by biotech firm CSL after trials showed it could interfere with HIV diagnosis.","“Science cannot be all about producing positive results; negative results will and must occur,” said Diego Silva, an expert at the University of Sydney School of Public Health.","“Negative results are also as important as success in science, since they, too, form part of the evidence base for future research.”","Sanofi said Friday’s results from Phase I/II trials showed “an immune response comparable to patients who recovered from COVID-19 in adults aged 18 to 49 years, but a low immune response in older adults likely due to an insufficient concentration of the antigen”.","“With this type of vaccine, the result is not a surprise, we know that more antigen is needed in older patients. But when in Phase I and II, drugmakers test tolerance and one cannot test strong dosages,” said Jean-Daniel Lelievre, head of clinic immunology and infectious diseases at Henri-Mondor hospital in Creteil, France.",“I would think Sanofi and GSK will be able to improve their vaccine.”,Phase III studies were expected to start this month.

These include the use of so-called mRNA, pursued by Moderna MRNA.O and Biontech 22UAy.F, where genetic code is injected into the body to instruct human cells to make virus-like proteins that trigger an immune response.","AstraZeneca AZN.L and Oxford University's viral vector approach, where harmless viruses instruct human cells to make virus-like proteins, also needs no adjuvants.",The United States last week secured almost a third of the first 1 billion doses planned for AstraZeneca’s experimental COVID-19 vaccine by pledging up to $1.2 billion.,On Thursday GSK said that making its adjuvant available to the world’s poorest countries will be a key part of its efforts.

The plans, which sued back in 2010, alleged that GSK had falsely touted Avandia as a boon to the cardiovascular health of diabetes patients, which is why health plans were willing to cover the drug’s high cost. But in 2007, the Food and Drug Administration required the company to change Avandia’s label to add a black-box warning that the drug may exacerbate heart conditions in some patients and was available only through a restricted distribution program.","Since that first label change – and while the litigation was ongoing – the FDA has come to believe that the entire body of clinical evidence does not indicate that Avandia is associated with increased risk of myocardial ischemia, or blocked blood flow to the heart. In 2014, the FDA directed GSK to remove information about restricted distribution from Avandia’s label. GSK, at the FDA’s direction, also removed language about myocardial ischemia from Avandia’s black box warning, although that warning continued to advise that the drug may cause or exacerbate congestive heart failure.",Want more On the Case? Listen to the On the Case podcast.,"In her 2017 ruling, Judge Rufe granted summary judgment to GSK on the health plans’ state-law claims. She found that they were preempted under the doctrine of “impossibility preemption”: GSK is bound by state laws, but it is ultimately required to defer to the FDA on drug labeling. Judge Rufe found GSK had proved that in 2006 and 2007, when the company and the FDA were discussing new studies on Avandia’s associated risk of myocardial ischemia, the FDA would not have approved a label change. (The judge also granted GSK summary judgment on the healthcare plans’ claims under the federal racketeering statute, but I’m focusing on the state law preemption issue.)","On Tuesday, two years after Judge Rufe’s summary judgment decision and nine years after the litigation began, the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued an opinion reviving the healthcare plans’ case. (The court entered the opinion on Dec. 3 but did not publish it until this week.) The 3rd Circuit’s preemption analysis hinged on the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling last May in Merck v. Albrecht – which means that a seven-month-old decision salvaged a nine-year-old case. Conventional wisdom is that time favors defendants. Not in this case.","In Merck, the Supreme Court built upon the drug labeling preemption base it established in 2009’s Wyeth v. Levine, in which the justices held that FDA authority does not categorically trump state failure-to-warn claims. The Merck decision provided a two-part test for drug company defendants to show that federal law prohibited them from adding a warning that would satisfy state law: They must prove that they kept the FDA fully informed of the justifications for adding a warning required by state law and they must show that the FDA, in turn, barred them from changing the label to include the warning required by state law.","“In other words,” the 3rd Circuit said in its Avandia decision, “the upshot of Merck is that a drug manufacturer must show that the FDA made a fully informed decision to reject a change to a drug’s label.”",The Supreme Court’s Merck decision – as Judge Luis Restrepo pointed out in Tuesday’s opinion for a panel that also included Judges Brooks Smith and Thomas Ambro – was actually issued after oral arguments last March in the 3rd Circuit’s Avandia case. The 3rd Circuit called for both sides to address how Merck affected their arguments.,"GSK’s lawyers at Kirkland & Ellis said in their brief that the company met both prongs of the Merck test. GSK said that as soon as meta-analysis of clinical data suggested an elevated risk for cardiac complications, it went to the FDA with a proposal to change Avandia’s label. The FDA, in GSK’s telling, said in a 2007 letter that it wouldn’t change the label without more information – but, according to GSK, such information didn’t exist at the time. GSK also argued that it could not have used an alternative process to add a warning on its own because it was on notice, from that 2007 letter, that the FDA would not approve the change.","The 3rd Circuit said GSK could not use that 2007 FDA call for more information as a shield. Under Merck, the appeals court said, the 2007 letter was proof that the FDA was not fully informed about whether cardiac risk required a change in Avandia’s label. By the very words of the letter, according to the 3rd Circuit, GSK failed the first prong of the Merck test.","GSK had argued that it had supplied the FDA with all of the existing data that was material to the FDA’s inquiry. The 3rd Circuit, citing a 2005 meta-analysis that produced results similar to the 2006 study that prompted GSK to go to the FDA, said the company’s argument “turns the regulatory regime on its head,.” Judge Restrepo wrote. Judge Restrepo wrote “GSK is not the arbiter of which data and information is or is not ‘material’ to the FDA’s decision to approve or reject a change to a drug’s label. The FDA, and only the FDA, can determine what information is ‘material.’”","The company also failed the second prong of the Merck test, the 3rd Circuit said, because the FDA did not say it would not approve a label change. The agency said in that 2007 letter that it needed more information and that GSK needed to address the data and information deficiencies – not, according to the 3rd Circuit, that it would reject a label change when it had the requisite information.","“At most, the letter indicates that it is possible that the FDA could have rejected the label change after receiving the various data and information it requested from GSK, but as the Supreme Court has reiterated, the ‘possibility of impossibility (is) not enough,’” the 3rd Circuit said, quoting Merck.","The appeals court reversed Judge Rufe’s summary judgment grant on the health funds’ state-law claims, as well as on the RICO claims. (The 3rd Circuit held that the trial judge hadn’t given the funds an adequate chance to show GSK was part of a racketeering enterprise.)","GSK counsel Jay Lefkowitz of Kirkland did not respond to an email request for comment. Nor did lead counsel for the funds, Thomas Sobol of Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro."

ADC, in turn, are antibodies with a cell toxin as a molecular add-on.","That allows chemotherapeutic agents, which are harmful to all human cells, to be brought to cancer cells at much higher doses than in conventional chemotherapy.","AstraZeneca agreed in March agreed to pay up to $6.9 billion to work with Daiichi Sankyo on an ADC against breast cancer, in a challenge to another ADC called Kadcyla, made by Roche.","Multiple myeloma is the second most common form of blood cancer. While it can be treated, there is no available cure, GSK said.","The condition is expected to claim the lives of 13,000 people in the U.S. in 2019, according to the American Cancer Society.","The BCMA protein that is characteristic of multiple myeloma is also being used as a target in cell therapies developed by Johnson & Johnson, bluebird bio Inc, Celgene Corp."

Thursday’s results showed that doubling the time between injections does not compromise efficacy or safety.,"Injections - targeted at patients unable to take, or not comfortable with, daily pills - are, however, seen as a smaller market opportunity than oral medicines.","“This is further progress in our efforts to reduce the number of medicines a person living with HIV must take while also reducing the frequency of treatments,” said Kimberly Smith, Head of Research & Development at ViiV.","The trial focused on the HIV-1 category of the AIDS virus, which has the most widespread strains.

In certain cases, depending on the drugs used, two-drug regimens will also be significantly cheaper.","Still, some doctors worry that using just two drugs to keep the AIDS virus at bay might risk drug resistance because HIV will only have to evade two drugs rather than three.

While no resistance was seen in the latest 48-week trials, there was a case in an earlier study, although GSK believes this was likely down to failure to take the drugs properly.","As a result, analysts think many physicians may stick with using three-drug combinations for now, suggesting a slow sales ramp-up for GSK.","That is certainly the expectation at Gilead, which anticipates imminent approval of Biktarvy in Europe and will also have some additional data to present in Amsterdam.","“Physicians are interested in anything new that comes along in HIV, as they should be, but are a bit cautious about anything that steps back from established standards,” Mike Elliott, Gilead’s European head of medical affairs, told Reuters.",GSK is more upbeat but acknowledges the HIV community may be divided.,"“Some clinicians will take the 48-week data and be absolutely convinced,” ViiV head of R&D Kimberly Smith told reporters on Wednesday.","“There will be others who, because this is a change in the treatment paradigm, will want to see longer-term data. We will be providing that as the GEMINI studies are designed to go for three years.”",GSK has made HIV a central pillar of the British company’s pharmaceuticals division and its strategy is all about coping with increasingly elderly patients who have to take HIV medicine for decades.,"Nearly half of all HIV patients in the profitable markets of North America and Europe are now over 50 and are vulnerable to side effects from the drugs that keep them alive, making tolerability more important than in the past.","“Quality of life is where the unmet medical need is,” said ViiV CEO Waterhouse."

Doctors will be presented with clinical data from a pivotal study in this patient group at ATS.",The so-called IMPACT study showed GSK’s once-daily Trelegy was superior to other approaches at reducing severe attacks and improving lung function.,"“I think the IMPACT data is going to generate lot of interest and out of that we will see a heightened interest in Trelegy,” Miels said.","Still, pricing pressure in respiratory medicine remains a black cloud, especially with U.S. generic Advair looming.","Although Advair copycats failed to launch in 2017 as U.S. regulators knocked back applications, they are very possible this year, with Mylan due to hear next month whether the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will approve its version.","The price squeeze in the U.S. inhaler market is proving more severe than GSK had anticipated at the start of the year, particularly in the ICS/LABA area, which includes Advair. Another class known as LAMA medicine is faring better.","Since Trelegy includes all three products in a single inhaler, it is potentially caught in the cross-fire.","GSK has priced Trelegy at a 20 percent discount to its components and the company has not reduced the price since its launch, but Miels acknowledged this might change once Advair generics arrive.","“We are not experiencing direct pressure on Trelegy at this point in time. I think it’s reasonable to think there will be some pressure with the introduction of Advair generics but we’re confident we can manage that,” he said.","Outside the United States, which is likely to account for around 60 percent of sales, Trelegy has already launched in Britain and is now being rolled out in Germany and Canada.",Consensus analyst forecasts compiled by Thomson Reuters don’t predict it becoming a $1 billion-a-year blockbuster before 2023 but Miels said such estimates looked conservative.,"“We are more confident,” he said. “Time will tell but I hope that over time the analysts will move their numbers up.”","Miels, who was hired by new CEO Emma Walmsley last year from AstraZeneca, has redeployed resources to focus on such priority products and nearly all of GSK’s more than 2,000 respiratory reps in the United States are now selling Trelegy and Nucala, plus two other relatively new lung drugs Breo and Anoro.",That leaves only a small contract team working on Advair.,GSK will also present long-term data on Nucala - a new kind of biotech drug for severe asthma - at ATS. The medicine has enjoyed a head-start over rivals but now faces competition from AstraZeneca’s Fasenra.

Without generics, earnings would be up 4 to 7 percent.","The timing of generic copies of its blockbuster lung drug arriving in the United States is a big uncertainty in 2018, after copycats failed to launch in 2017 because U.S. regulators knocked back applications.","This year, a substitutable copy of Advair is very possible, with Mylan MYL.O due to hear in June whether the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will approve its version.","Despite this threat, and looming competition from a new Gilead Sciences GILD.O HIV drug, GSK sees growth strengthening over the next few years, helped by the roll-out of newer medicines.","Walmsley, who took over a year ago, is focusing on rebuilding GSK's drug pipeline by overhauling research and appointing heavyweight outsiders, such as veteran Roche ROG.S scientist Hal Barron.","Barron, in turn, earlier this month hired a new head of pharma deal-making, signaling GSK’s intention to boost its drug pipeline through acquisitions and licensing agreements.","The main focus of acquisitions will be early-stage assets that can add to the pipeline of experimental drugs, Walmsley said, adding she was not interested in entering a $64 billion bidding war with Takeda Pharmaceutical 4502.T for Shire SHP.L.","“We have ruled out any interest in Shire,” she said.","Last month, GSK agreed to buy Novartis NOVN.S out of their consumer healthcare joint venture for $13 billion, but Walmsley has made clear the drugs pipeline will have first call on future investment resources."

A critical accompanying editorial, however, may make some doctors think twice before writing prescriptions.","Trelegy is the first once-daily triple medicine for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), putting GSK ahead of rivals such as AstraZeneca and Novartis, and it showed benefits over other treatments in the study.","But Dr. Samy Suissa of Canada’s McGill University and NEJM editor Dr. Jeffrey Drazen said the design of GSK’s clinical trial, known as IMPACT, may have artificially inflated its observed effectiveness.","“As such, we think that the IMPACT trial falls short of providing the awaited robust evidence to better understand the potential for stepping up to single-inhaler triple therapy in clinical practice,” they wrote.","GSK said it did not believe the editorial presented an accurate picture of Trelegy’s benefit-risk profile, adding that the critique reflected the long-held views of Suissa.","The British drugmaker views Trelegy as a critical new product, along with shingles vaccine Shingrix, as it seeks to fill a revenue gap left by falling sales of the older lung drug Advair, which could face U.S. generic competition this year."
