Similarly, the constitutional right of firearms ownership carries with it certain responsibilities and the Company has long advocated the safe and responsible ownership and use of firearms.”",Sturm Ruger representatives did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.,"Second-ranked proxy adviser Glass Lewis made the same recommendations to Sturm Ruger investors on April 14, citing gun violence as a risk to the company’s reputation.",Just what additional steps if any weapons makers should take on safety has drawn renewed interest in the wake of a shooting at a Florida high school in February in which 17 people were killed.,"Banks including Citigroup Inc and Bank of America Corp lately have restricted lending to clients involved with firearms.

It asks the company report on gun safety such as how it monitors violence, research on safer guns, and its assessment of risks to its reputation.","The proposal mentions smart guns, designs with electronic limits on their ability to fire, which it says could help reduce accidental shootings and suicides.",Smart guns have faced opposition from gun rights groups concerned about their practicality and legislative implications.,"ISS wrote the technology could make guns safer, and that a market for smart guns could help overcome engineering problems. ISS noted the proposal does not call for the production of smart guns, but only seeks evidence that Sturm Ruger’s board is properly assessing risks."
