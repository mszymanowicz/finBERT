The following are some of the recent deals, launches and development projects in the space:","- British animal health company Dechra Pharmaceuticals Inc DPH.L agreed to a deal www.akstonbio.com in August to utilize development work by U.S. insulin specialist Akston Biosciences for a once weekly shot for diabetic dogs to replace daily injections, with a view to expanding the collaboration to cats. Dechra has said long-acting insulin, which is typically produced from genetically modified bacteria, should become its biggest product.","- U.S. animal health company Kindred Biosciences Inc KIN.O, which repurposed a human antidepressant to stimulate appetite in underweight cats, has several genetically engineered biologic drugs under development kindredbio.com/pipeline, targeting diseases such as dermatitis in dogs and anemia in cats.",- German early-stage biotech research firm Adivo in April signed a global collaboration deal here with Bayer's BAYGn.DE animal health unit a little over a year after Adivo was spun out of human biotech firm Morphosys MORG.DE with a mission to develop antibodies for dogs.,"- Privately-held German drugmaker Boehringer Ingelheim, the global No. 2 in animal health, in April launched here the first stem cell-based veterinary medicine to treat lameness in horses caused by inflamed joints, a common worry for both recreational and competitive riders.","- Industry leader Zoetis Inc ZTS.N, which has a successful anti-itch biotech drug for dogs on the market, said here in August it was seeking approval for more antibodies, targeting osteoarthritic pain in cats with plans for a 2021 market launch, drawing on its 2017 acquisition of Nexvet Biopharma. A similar product for dogs is also in the pipeline.","- In June of 2018, Zoetis signed a deal here with human biotech firm Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc REGN.O to adopt its antibody technology for animals, targeting inflammatory disease and cancer."

For a FACTBOX, click","Sector leader Zoetis ZTS.N and others say animal drug development is faster, less expensive and more predictable than drugs for people.","“It’s not nearly as common for pivotal studies to fail in animal health as it is in human medicine. Most of them are successful,” said Cheryl London, professor in comparative oncology at Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine at Tufts University in Massachusetts.","Biotech drugs for pets, if proven safe and effective, would be a boon to a $44 billion veterinary medicines market currently dominated by vaccines, flea and tick repellents and anti-infectives.",A recent product launch has galvanized the industry.,"Cytopoint for canine itch relief sold by Zoetis reached blockbuster status by animal health standards in its second year on the market. Launched in late 2016, Cytopoint generated 2018 sales of $129 million, and first-quarter 2019 sales jumped 65% from a year earlier.","Produced from cloned genetically engineered hamster cells over at least eight bio-processing steps, the monoclonal antibody is no less complex than comparable therapeutic proteins used in human medicine. But the cost to consumers is far less.","Like many biotech drugs, dose and cost is determined by weight. Zoetis declined to disclose its prices. But an animal hospital in Stamford, Connecticut, for example, charges $104 for a 40-pound (18 kg) dog. For much smaller dogs, a Cytopoint injection, which lasts about four to eight weeks, costs about $35 to $50. To keep a large dog from scratching itself raw could run $140 per shot.","The cost of a highly effective new anti-itch biotech drug to treat severe atopic dermatitis in humans can run about $30,000 a year.",‘TURNING POINT’,"“Cytopoint was a turning point that has made it clear that (biotech drugs) can be successful in this space,” London said. “Now there are an estimated five to ten companies developing antibodies for the veterinary market.”",That has created increased business for related services.,"“It’s a big challenge for us to keep up with the pace of demand growth,” said Klaus Hellmann, managing director at Munich-based Klifovet AG, Europe’s largest contractor for late-stage clinical trials of veterinary drugs.","While Cytopoint sparked investment interest in biotech treatments for animals, drug development still comes with inherent risks and uncertainty.","Aratana Therapeutics Inc’s canine lymphoma drug, Blontress, was launched in 2015, but later withdrawn after scientific data led the company to determine it was unlikely to be a financial success.",Declining costs has mitigated some of the risk.,"“Over the past several years, human health has been able to advance the technology to improve efficiency of their cell production systems,” said Rob Polzer, head of global therapeutics research for Zoetis.","Zoetis can repurpose and optimize existing procedures, mechanisms of action and technologies, it said.","The company is seeking approval for a biotech medicine to treat osteoarthritic pain in cats, with plans for a 2021 market launch and a similar product for dogs thereafter.",Others have jumped on the bandwagon.,German start-up Adivo was spun out of biotech firm Morphosys MORG.DE in March 2018 out of frustration by its founders that scientific advances for humans were not translating into better treatment options for their dogs.,It has since struck a global collaboration deal with Bayer's BAYGn.DE animal health unit for its early-stage research platform for animal-specific monoclonal antibodies - the backbone of biotechnology.,"“Over the last few years, the veterinary market has seen an incredibly dynamic development,” said Adivo co-founder Kathrin Ladetzki-Baehs.","This could prove a lifesaver for Moose, the bulldog in the oncology drug trial.","In early August, Lescault discovered a mass on Moose’s throat, soon followed by deteriorating health and a diagnosis of canine B-cell lymphoma. Moose was given one to two months to live without treatment or about a year with 25 weeks of punishing chemotherapy.",Lescault’s local vet suggested the Tufts trial testing an experimental protein that could help advance the current immuno-oncology craze into the animal health arena.,"Tufts declined to disclose the compound or the study’s sponsor. But more than three weeks into the trial, Moose’s cough and labored breathing has disappeared and he is back to his playful and boisterous self, Lescault said.","While treatment in a clinical trial is free, Lescault said she would not hesitate to pay thousands of dollars for a safe and effective drug to save Moose. “I wouldn’t blink an eye,” she said.",That is exactly what drug companies are banking on.

King and Associates analyst David Westenberg. “If there’s another bidder, I don’t think Zoetis would go any higher,” he said.","However, should there be a rival offer, the companies most likely to make a bid would be Eli Lilly and Co's LLY.N animal health unit Elanco or candy and pet food company Mars Inc, Westenberg said.","Other possible bidders include dental supply firms Henry Schein Inc HSIC.O and Patterson Companies Inc PDCO.O, which also have animal health divisions, he added.",Zoetis plans to fund the acquisition through cash and new debt.
