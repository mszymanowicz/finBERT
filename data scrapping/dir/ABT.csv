Equally worrying was a precipitous rise in leverage as the pandemic led to deferred sponsorship payments and lost season ticket sales: net debt stood at 474 million pounds, or nearly 4 times trailing EBITDA.","There’s reason to hope for an 89th minute turnaround. The Red Devils managed to grow sales from sponsorships and retail – over half of total revenue – by 1.4% year-on-year. The team which includes French midfielder Paul Pogba qualified for the pan-European Champions League, meaning greater TV money. Deloitte reckons the latter will grow by 68% this season for England’s Premier League collectively, which would more than offset Manchester United’s matchday sales last year. And if a newfangled FIFA-backed European club championship ever happens, Manchester United will definitely be in it. (By Christopher Thompson)","OLD NORMAL. Swedish private equity giant EQT is spending again. The 16 billion euro group run by Christian Sinding invested 6 billion euros in the third quarter of 2020, compared with 3.4 billion euros in the same period a year earlier. That compares with a one-fifth slump for the European private equity market as a whole, according to PitchBook.","One possibility is that Sinding’s EQT is a leading indicator. Buyout groups have raised a lot of money in recent years, but won’t earn big fees unless they spend. The alternative is that it is imprudently splashing cash before it’s clear what the post-virus world will look like. EQT is investing in buzzy trends: 80% of investment over the past 12 months has gone into healthcare, media, telecommunications and technology, which often carry high valuation multiples. Mid-crisis investing has worked for private equity groups in the past – but only when the assets are going cheap. (By Liam Proud)","BEWARE THE DRAGON. Ericsson’s impressive earnings uplift may be short-lived. The Swedish telecoms provider’s share price rose 7% on Wednesday after strong sales in China saw the group report a meaty 8.6 billion Swedish crown ($985 million) operating profit for the third quarter, compared with a loss in the same period in 2019. Despite the pandemic, Chief Executive Borje Ekholm was upbeat about the outlook for 5G contracts in mainland China, a crucial source of earnings growth, given that the country accounts for roughly the entire projected global expansion in 5G network equipment this year.","Such optimism could prove ephemeral. Barely 24 hours earlier, Sweden joined other European countries in banning China’s Huawei Technologies and ZTE, from developing its domestic 5G network due to security concerns. Given that Huawei is Ericsson’s biggest rival, the Swedish company may face a stiff reaction from Chinese regulators, who have already called for stricter supervision of foreign telecoms operators. Ericsson shareholders have been forewarned. (By Christopher Thompson)","RARE OPPORTUNITIES. Australian rare-earth producer Lynas enjoyed a recovery in the first quarter of fiscal 2021, despite and because of the virus. Easing Covid-19 restrictions Down Under and in Malaysia finally allowed production to rev up: the company pointed to a 73% quarter-on-quarter increase in its output of neodymium and praseodymium, vital ingredients for magnets, iPhones and electric cars. Chief Executive Amanda Lacaze also argued in her results review that the pandemic’s squeeze on supplies might push buyers to diversify their sources of rare earths beyond China.","That’s talking her own book, but it holds an element of truth. Washington is keen to lessen its dependence on the People’s Republic, the world’s largest producer of rare earths. Investors seem to buy the thesis, pushing Lynas shares up 4% in Sydney on Wednesday. But the coronavirus is still a wild card. Another outbreak could crimp operations and demand. (By Katrina Hamlin)"

Investors may be focused on how soon a coronavirus vaccine will arrive to end the coronavirus pandemic. But rapid, cheap testing will arrive sooner and may be more important. The emergency approval of Abbott Laboratories’ $5, 15-minute test added $13 billion to its maker’s market value on Thursday morning.","America’s testing campaign has been a disaster, with too few kits and people waiting too long for results – an average of four days in July, a survey shows. That’s roughly the same as April. Such delays make tests close to useless, as outbreaks can fester.","Abbott’s test requires a less invasive nasal swabbing than other iterations and appears reliable, at least in a clinical trial. The company plans to produce 50 million per month starting in October, about twice as many as all Americans tested in July. Assuming Abbott can distribute them effectively, it’s potentially a big step forward. (By Robert Cyran)","BUCK STOPS HERE. Dollar General is hitting the pandemic sweet spot. On Thursday, the $50 billion discount retailer reported an almost 19% second-quarter increase in same-store sales from the same period last year, crushing the average analyst estimate by over 3 percentage points. While its share price has slipped from a record high, it’s still up around 30% this year, outpacing Walmart.","It’s clearly benefitting from 2020 anxiety. Store traffic may have fallen, but average transaction totals rose. Quarantines led consumers to stock up on essentials, while a severe economic contraction left millions out of work or worried about money. Its rival Dollar Tree – which is about half its size – also outperformed quarterly sales estimates, though with more modest results.","Granted, panic-shopping is likely to subside. But people will always need to buy food. And the congressional logjam over the next round of stimulus from Uncle Sam could prompt even more consumers to start counting pennies. (By Anna Szymanski)","JOB CUTS. It bodes ill for the job market when recruiters cull their own staff. Hays said on Thursday that the fees it earns from placing white collar workers in temporary and permanent positions collapsed by 34% in the three months ending June from the same period last year. Chief Executive Alistair Cox plans to cut costs by trimming his workforce, which had already shrunk by nearly a tenth in June compared with a year earlier.",Corporate recruitment in the United States and Europe has stalled since the outbreak of the pandemic in March. Hays said that it was seeing modest signs of improvement in the permanent placements while temporary jobs were stable overall. And Cox sounded an optimistic note on group fees which started to stabilise in May. But its planned layoffs suggest a sustained rebound in the labour market may be some way off. (By Aimee Donnellan),"LOOKING UP. Advertising giant WPP can breathe a little easier. The London-listed company on Thursday said second quarter revenue fell 18.4% from a year earlier and declined 15.1% after deducting costs that are passed onto clients. While grim, the second metric was better than the drop of a fifth that had been expected by analysts. As advertising campaigns resume, so will dividends. Chief Executive Mark Read declared a 10 pence per share interim dividend for 2020, having scrapped the 2019 payout.","It’s not just the pandemic that Read wants to put behind him. The company’s 2.7 billion pound write-down, mainly on a dotcom deal, helps move the company on from his predecessor Martin Sorrell’s era. Shares rose 5% despite the hit to profit because investors viewed the move as a sign of a conservative management in uncertain times: a welcome approach for an industry in flux. (By Dasha Afanasieva)","SAFE AS HOUSES. Lockdowns were a boon for vice industries. Sales of alcohol and cannabis, and traffic to porn sites, surged in March and April. Flutter Entertainment – the 20 billion pound London-listed owner of Paddy Power Betfair, PokerStars and Sky Betting & Gaming – offers another case study. First-half results on Thursday showed that EBITDA rose 35% year-on-year to 684 million pounds, even though key sports-betting divisions were on ice during the soccer season’s hiatus.","Some of the gains may last. Poker players’ average weekly spending rose 5% from a year earlier to 10.40 pounds, while PokerStars’ had 70% more daily customers in the second quarter. The number of online bettors in Flutter’s sports-focused UK and Irish unit is growing more quickly than before Covid-19. Even if customers lay off the booze after lockdowns lift, their penchant for a punt may persist. (By Liam Proud)","SPLIT MILK. China Mengniu Dairy is making the most of a sour situation. First-half net profit at the Hong Kong-listed company fell 42% year-on-year, contracting much faster than revenue, on the back of coronavirus-related expenses. But the $18 billion dairy giant is optimistic about the future, insisting the pandemic has raised consumer interest in health and nutrition and, by extension, dairy products.","That’s some consolation. Mengniu’s dealmaking prospects are less likely to recover anytime soon. On Tuesday, the company effectively gave up on a A$600 million, about $430 million, acquisition of Kirin’s wholly owned Australian dairy business. It followed reports that authorities Down Under might block the sale by the Japanese seller. Countries around the world have become more circumspect about Chinese capital as the People’s Republic leads a global economy recovery. Mengniu’s profits might bounce back but there is still plenty of pandemic-related split milk. (By Sharon Lam)"

Once the desirable target of four suitors, a U.S. broadcaster is finding its partners are dropping like flies because of “market dislocation.” Tegna, which operates 62 local TV stations, said on Sunday that rival Gray Television and private equity firm Apollo Global Management had second thoughts after both parties ended discussions valuing the broadcaster at $8.5 billion including debt. Two other buyers may be interested but it’s looking doubtful after Tegna noted that neither signed NDAs.","Meantime, Tegna is fending off a proxy fight from Standard General, which owns nearly a 10% interest in the $2.3 billion broadcaster. Standard General blamed Tegna on Monday of stalling the auction. In theory a deal could still happen. Tegna benefits in part from political advertising, which, in a presidential election year, is the closest thing to a near certainty. But Morgan Stanley is still forecasting a 9% drop in local TV advertising this year. If Standard General wants a deal, it may only have itself to encourage. (By Jennifer Saba)","DESIGNER HAIR SHIRTS. Carlos Torres Vila can expect to receive fewer Christmas cards this year from European banking peers. The executive chairman of BBVA, Spain’s second largest lender, has renounced the 2020 bonuses of 300 senior staff, including himself, in order to “lead from the front” during the coronavirus crisis. The move heaps pressure on other lenders to follow suit.","BBVA expects to save some 50 million euros, equivalent to 0.8% of annual personnel costs. If the same proportion was applied at BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse, Barclays and Santander, then Europe’s six biggest banks could collectively conserve over half a billion euros, according to their latest results. That would soothe shareholders fretting about dividend cuts and help fend off the kind of anti-bank sentiment seen after the 2008 crisis. Yet, having given up their bonuses, it may be harder for bankers to make the case for such fat payouts when the crisis ends. (By Christopher Thompson)","WALL STREET LOSES AN EXECUTIVE. Jefferies Group’s chief financial officer has died of Covid-19 complications. The Wall Street firm, which typically reports its earnings a month before rivals, is often where investors look to see where the industry is going. Peg Broadbent’s death adds another reminder of how rapidly the world has changed.","Broadbent had worked at Jefferies since 2007, when he joined as the group’s first global risk chief just as the financial crisis hit. The investment bank – now a subsidiary of listed Jefferies Financial – came through the crisis mostly unscathed, and didn’t take government rescue funds.","Last week Jefferies reported record quarterly revenue, as a group and at the investment bank Broadbent helped to oversee. Chief Executive Rich Handler noted that in light of events since its financial quarter ended in February, the result already feels like “ancient history.” He won’t be the last to say so.

The market value of Abbott Laboratories, which obtained approval for a rapid coronavirus test, rocketed over $10 billion at the start of U.S. trading on Monday morning. The five-minute test is the fruit of a merger Abbott didn’t want to do. The company says tests will be available this week and production will rise to 50,000 per day. It could sell more: Quick tests could be crucial to the safe reopening of factories and public spaces, as well as for use in medical facilities.","The irony is that Abbott’s new bounty comes from technology purchased in its acquisition of Alere. Abbott agreed to buy the company for $5.8 billion in 2016, then got cold feet following revelations of improper accounting at Alere as well as allegations of other bad practices. Alere sued because it didn’t want the deal terminated, and Abbott begrudgingly completed the deal in 2017 at a 9% lower price. Its unexpected virus-testing boost is worth twice the purchase price. (By Robert Cyran)","SICKLY M&A. The UK’s most prominent recent fund management deal could fall foul of the coronavirus. A pandemic probably wasn’t high on Chief Executive Andrew Formica’s radar when he announced in February that his Jupiter Fund Management would gobble up smaller rival Merian Global Investors for 370 million pounds. Back then investors seemed happy to forgive Formica for the deal’s vague benefits: Jupiter didn’t say what synergies it expected to get from combining with Merian, other than to promise that the acquired group had “the potential to contribute to” an operating margin of up to 60%.","That may be a stretch now. Merian was losing assets before the virus struck. Now it faces declines in the value of the funds it manages, and possibly even more outflows. The over 50% collapse in Jupiter’s share price since the beginning of the year, worse than peers M&G and Standard Life Aberdeen, suggests investors don’t see much benefit from the deal. They will have the chance to vote on whether to proceed in April. To convince them, Formica will need to come up with some more compelling numbers. (By Aimee Donnellan)","SOCCER SACRIFICE.

Juventus star Cristiano Ronaldo will forfeit four months’ salary, a third of his 31 million euro annual package, according to Sky Italia. His teammates and coach will do the same, saving the club a total of about 90 million euros – meaningful given its 327 million euro net debt.","Not every footballer has volunteered happily. Barcelona, which had sought a 70% salary reduction for players including star forward Lionel Messi, used Spain’s emergency law to unilaterally impose a cut. Swiss club Sion fired nine of its players for refusing to accept part-time contracts. With millions of people facing the prospect of losing their jobs, some soccer self-restraint seems in order.

After Moody’s cut South Africa’s credit to junk status on Friday, in line with other ratings agencies, the Rainbow Nation’s finance minister admitted Treasury officials were “trembling in our boots”. With foreigners owning 37% of South Africa’s 2.2 trillion rand ($120 billion) domestic bond market, his concerns are warranted.","The biggest fear is that South Africa’s impending ejection from investment-grade bond indexes will have overseas investors rushing to the exit. The rand fell 2% to a record low of 18.08 against the U.S. dollar on Monday morning. But it may not be all doom and gloom. South Africa’s trajectory has been obvious for years. The coronavirus-triggered stampede from emerging markets will have cleared out the remaining laggards. Other nations are also facing similar downgrades. For Mboweni and his quaking colleagues, that’s some consolation. (By Ed Cropley)","CHINESE CARMAKERS REV UP. Geely Automobile has warned that this year could be among the most difficult in the group’s history with the fallout from Covid-19 coming on top of an earlier industry-wide slowdown: the $13 billion Chinese carmaker on Monday reported a 35% fall in year-on-year net profit in 2019. The desperation is evident. As China gets back to work, carmakers are aggressively pushing sales, offering steep discounts and turning to social media celebrities to win a slice of limited spending on big-ticket items. Such gimmicks are likely to be repeated worldwide by rivals when they put their foot back on the metal. Credit ratings agency Moody’s expects global auto sales to fall around 14% this year. Autos and much more will become a buyer’s market. (By Sharon Lam)"

More recently, the company has sought to expand access to its so-called continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) devices - traditionally sold to type 1 diabetics in markets with generous insurance coverage.","“It’s not good enough to bring this to a small, wealthy population. Diabetes is such a global epidemic that you need to bring products that can really make a dent in that,” Watkin said.","Launched in Europe in 2014 and in the United States three years later, the FreeStyle Libre allows people with diabetes to track blood sugar levels without multiple daily finger sticks.","A sensor attached to the back of the upper arm uses a thin filament under the skin to measure glucose every minute. Users check their blood sugar levels throughout the day by waving a reader, or smartphone, over the sensor. Major competitors Medtronic Plc MDT.N and Dexcom Inc DXCM.O critique the current Libre's lack of automatic alerts that can help diabetics manage their disease. Yet they also are taking steps to introduce cheaper models themselves, executives told Reuters.","Libre’s sales are expected to reach $1.5 billion this year, the company said. In April, Goldman Sachs estimated the global CGM market could reach $5 billion by 2021, up from $3.7 billion in 2019. Goldman projected Abbott’s 2021 sales at $2.7 billion compared to $1.7 billion for Dexcom and $894 million for Medtronic.",‘SCRATCHING THE SURFACE’,"In the past, CGMs were used almost exclusively by type 1 diabetics, whose bodies do not make insulin and who must inject themselves with the blood-sugar regulating hormone to survive.","Increasingly, people with type 2 diabetes - the kind driven by obesity, lack of exercise and genetics - must also closely monitor their blood glucose and use insulin to manage their disease when it is not controlled by other medications and lifestyle changes.","For now, Libre users include 1 million type 1 diabetic patients and half a million type 2. That’s a tiny sliver of the 425 million people with diabetes worldwide.","Although not all diabetics need glucose monitors, “there is an element of scratching the surface at this point,” Watkin said. “The need to invest and bring up capacity is, we believe, going to be an ongoing activity for us.”","Two 14-day Libre sensors, a month’s supply, retail for $109. Abbott says most of its patients are commercially insured, and many pay as little as $10 out of pocket.","In the United States, the company says, more than half of people in commercial health plans are covered, as well as any eligible diabetic person on Medicare, the federal program for the elderly and disabled. The device is also approved in 45 other countries, including Germany, Japan, Brazil, China and the United Arab Emirates.",Medtronic told Reuters it offers a discounted price of $345 per month for uninsured patients. The company estimates that the typical insured patient pays $50 a month. Medicare does not cover the device.,"Dexcom’s G6 sensors retail online, with a discount, at around $350 for a month’s supply. Dexcom says 98 percent of all U.S. private insurers cover the device, and patients covered by commercial insurance pay an average of $50-$80 per month for sensors through pharmacies or durable medical equipment suppliers. It is covered by Medicare.","Libre’s 14-day sensor is also longer-lasting. Dexcom’s sensors work for 10 days, and Medtronic’s for up to 7.

Sales across all the company’s business units, except in its established pharmaceuticals business, beat expectations.","The established pharmaceuticals, which sells generic drugs in emerging growth countries such as India, raked in sales of 1.04 billion, but missed analysts’ consensus estimates of $1.08 billion.","The weak sales were due to a slowing market growth rate in Russia, Chief Executive Miles White said on a conference call.","“We seem to have a given market that affects our established pharmaceuticals or even our nutrition business from time to time somewhere. And in this particular case, it’s Russia,” White said.","The company reported net earnings of $418 million, or 23 cents per share, in the quarter ended March 31, compared to $419 million, or 24 cents per share, a year earlier.","Profit from Abbott’s medical device business - its largest division - continued to benefit from its $25 billion purchase of St. Jude Medical, and from new device launches. Sales for the unit rose 14.6 percent to $2.74 billion in the quarter."
