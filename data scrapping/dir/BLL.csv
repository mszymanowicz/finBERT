Named after the British yachtswoman who set a record for circumnavigating the globe, it focuses on shifting the economy to a circular model that eliminates waste.","Andrew Morlet, the foundation’s chief executive, said it had previously worked closely with companies, governments and cities and the education system.","“The finance sector is a very important part of accelerating this transition,” he said.","(This story corrects paragraph 3 to show 90% of equity assets, not all assets under management)"
