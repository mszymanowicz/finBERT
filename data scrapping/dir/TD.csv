But slower U.S. expansion more recently, and challenges in other segments like capital markets, will continue to weigh into 2020, he said.","Pressure on net interest margins in the United States could ease as the Federal Reserve pauses rate cuts following three reductions this year. Canada faces the prospect of lower rates if global trade uncertainties escalate, which could pressure margins at home.","As growth slows, banks are seeking to increase longer-term efficiencies through investments in new technologies, and undertaking restructures, which is lifting short-term costs.","“Banks are in a slow-growth environment but are having to continue making these investments,” Teich said.","Despite the challenges, Schwartz said Canadian banks are still worth holding as they are attractively valued.","Canadian banks are trading at between 9.3 and 11.3 times forward earnings, compared with valuations of over 12 times earnings for some of the biggest U.S. banks.",“Where will you find 3-5% dividend (yield and growth in 2020) at 10 times earnings?
