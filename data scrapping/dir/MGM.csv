One of its Asian investors, Snow Lake, wants the U.S. casino operator to sell a fifth of its $6 billion Macau business to a Chinese partner. Although it would complicate deals at home and elsewhere, the idea has plenty of merit.","Macau plans to entertain bids for casino concessions next year. It will be a pivotal time for MGM Resorts, with plenty at stake. The world’s biggest gambling hub accounted for almost a quarter of its $12.9 billion of revenue in 2019. As China’s economy recovers, the post-pandemic prospects are also tantalising for what was a $37 billion market just a year ago.","With China and the United States at loggerheads, both Beijing and Macau might prefer local ownership. The possibility seems to have dawned on shareholders. Macau’s three American operators have been trading at a discount to homegrown companies such as Galaxy Entertainment, SJM and Melco Resorts and Entertainment, in terms of their enterprise value to EBITDA multiples. A partner closer to home might help MGM make a stronger case for a new licence and favourable terms. Snow Lake founder Sean Ma suggested online travel outfit Trip, food-delivery to bookings giant Meituan, hotel chain Huazhu or tourism group Sunac China as possibilities.","The virus has suppressed casino share price, but an MGM China stake sale would still bring a useful chunk of change. An $11 billion offer from MGM Resorts for Entain, the owner of British betting shop Ladbrokes, was rejected this week. MGM Resorts is also poised to apply for a licence in Japan, a project that could require a $10 billion investment.","Taking on a big Chinese backer would ruffle feathers elsewhere, however. It might deter other potential local partners. The gambling industry in particular is vulnerable to concerns over an owner’s so-called “probity”, or suitability to hold a gaming licence. MGM itself endured intense U.S. scrutiny back in 2009 for its connections with Macau’s Ho family. That makes the investor proposal something of a roll of the dice. On balance, though, it’s probably worth a punt."

The UK bookie, which on Monday said it had rebuffed several merger proposals, has good reasons to want more. But its negotiating power is limited.","The American resorts-to-roulette group most recently offered 0.6 of its own shares for each one in Entain, the Ladbrokes parent previously known as GVC. Using MGM’s closing price on Dec. 31 that values the target’s equity at $11 billion, a 22% premium. Entain’s board, led by Chairman Barry Gibson, said the proposal “significantly undervalues” the company, effectively telling MGM Chief Executive Bill Hornbuckle to come up with something better.","Investors who pushed Entain shares up 27% on Monday morning are betting he will. MGM has its eye on the burgeoning American market for online sports-betting. It would be in a much better position to grab a large slice of that business if it had control of Entain’s digital-gaming technology, which is tried and tested in markets like Britain where betting on sports has always been legal. Currently Hornbuckle has to go through a cumbersome joint venture with the UK group, in which both sides own a 50% stake.","Assume Entain’s joint venture with MGM captures 10% of the U.S. sports-betting market, which Jefferies analysts reckon will eventually hit $19 billion. Valued at the same 8.6 times multiple of expected 2023 revenue as fantasy-sports group DraftKings, Entain’s half of the U.S. business would be worth $8.1 billion. That suggests MGM’s offer, which is worth $14 billion including debt, attaches little value to Entain’s non-U.S. assets.","What’s more, many UK-based investors cannot hold U.S. shares, meaning they will miss out on any upside. Famed internet investor Barry Diller, whose IAC owns 12% of MGM, could potentially help by offering to buy more shares.","Entain’s ability to extract a much higher price, however, looks doubtful. MGM could potentially kill any rival bids by threatening to ditch the joint venture. And the UK company’s struggling legacy business means its standalone prospects are dicey. In other words, MGM may be close to its maximum stake."

The data will not be exclusive to MGM, leaving the league open to similar deals with other sportsbooks.","The deal also covers “advanced game data” that the league is currently developing, intended to measure real-time action and is not just static and finite, Bettman said.","“Data’s the key,” said MGM Chief Executive Jim Murren. The data must be trusted, specific, endorsed and real-time, he said.","The monetary value of the deal was not disclosed. But it is a fixed price, not any portion of betting activity, Bettman said."
