Even ‘lactose-free’ might not be allowed... it’s madness.”,"The draft legislation, Amendment 171, gained the support of the European parliament last October with 54% of MEPS in favour, even in the same voting round that overturned a proposed EU ban on the term ‘veggie burger’.","It now needs approval from EU member states and parliament, who will discuss it this week along with the Commission. If eventually signed off, the law would be rolled out across the bloc’s 27 member states.","A Commission representative confirmed that the amendment would be discussed in negotiations this week, but said it could not pre-empt the outcome.","Existing EU regulation prohibits plant-based products from being called names like ‘vegan yoghurt’ or ‘almond milk’, and representatives for Danone, Nestle and Unilever told Reuters they did not see a need for further restrictions on labelling.","“This is unjust discrimination towards plant-based products,” said Danone’s head of regulatory in Iberia, Pedro Neves, adding that overhauling plant-based product branding would carry a high cost for companies.","Critics say the amendment goes against the commitment outlined in Europe’s climate strategy to move consumers towards more plant-based diets, and is caving to pressure from Europe’s dairy industry, which has the largest production of milk relative to population size among the G20.","“We are in a race against the climate clock. To introduce legislative barriers at a point when science shows how important it is to shift towards plant-based diets is absurd,” said Cecilia McAleavy, public affairs director at Swedish plant-based product maker Oatly.","While dairy producers in countries like Australia and the United States are lobbying for the same rule, courts in those countries have largely overruled their proposals as long as product names included a qualifier like ‘plant-based’.","Europe’s Dairy Association argues that labels comparing products to dairy confuse the consumer, and that the plant-based food industry is blurring the lines between product types.","“The term ‘cheese substitute’ misleads consumers’ capacities to choose consciously. This so-called ‘substitute’ clearly differs from real cheese... it is simply a different product,” its secretary-general Alexander Anton told Reuters.",But studies by the European Consumer Organisation on consumer understanding of ‘meaty’ names for vegan alternatives and surveys in Portugal and Spain on perception of dairy alternatives indicate most consumers do not find such comparisons confusing.,"“Descriptive terms such as ‘dairy alternative’ help consumers understand the characteristics of the product, facilitating more sustainable choices,” a Unilever spokeswoman said.","Across Europe, plant-based product sales, currently at 3 billion euros ($3.62 billion), are projected to rise to 5 billion by 2025, according to ING Research – still just 4.1% of dairy sales. Plant-based drinks have the strongest foothold, with 10% of the market for milk."

The company has since replaced its Dutch chairman and chief executive.,"In 2018, Unilever was still reeling from an unexpected $143 billion takeover approach from Kraft Heinz KHC.O and Britain's exit strategy from the European Union was being negotiated.","The new plan is the “best tactical option”, Unilever’s Danish Chairman Nils Andersen told reporters.","Unilever, the world's second biggest packaged food company behind Nestle NESN.S, said the proposal was the result of an 18-month review and was accelerated partly by a decision to demerge its tea business, a review of which is still underway.","The unification would be achieved through a cross-border merger, with shareholders of Dutch Unilever NV UNA.AS getting one share of British Unilever Plc ULVR.L for each share held.",Half of the Dutch shareholders and 75% of the British shareholders will need to approve the plan for it to proceed.,"“It makes sense for the company to have as flexible an operational structure as possible, and this appears to achieve it without any obvious downside,” Steve Clayton, UK fund manager of the Hargreaves Lansdown Select Fund range, which owns Unilever shares.","Unilever’s revenue is under pressure from slowing emerging markets, North American competition and the COVID-19 pandemic, which has hurt outdoor ice cream sales.","Barclays analyst Warren Ackerman said Unilever could be vulnerable to activist investors, given its recent sales performance and valuation.

The consumer giant on Thursday unveiled a plan to unify its dual holding companies in London, less than two years after UK shareholders rejected an attempt to create a single Dutch parent. This attempt has a greater chance of success.","The $143 billion group has long wanted to ditch its Anglo-Dutch structure, which makes it harder to carve out unwanted businesses and almost impossible to pay for acquisitions by issuing stock. In 2018 former Chief Executive Paul Polman tried to fold the two holding companies into a single parent based in Rotterdam.","But some shareholders in London, which accounts for about 45% of the group’s market capitalisation, rebelled. The move would have ejected Unilever from the FTSE 100 index, which tracks companies whose primary listing is in London, forcing shareholders whose mandate is restricted to UK shares to sell. FTSE Russell, which administers the benchmark, rejected requests for an exemption.",New boss Alan Jope is now trying the same move in reverse by offering shareholders in the Amsterdam-listed unit an equivalent share in London-listed Unilever PLC. As the deal requires approval from just 50% of Dutch shareholders – compared with 75% in the United Kingdom – the bar for rebellion is higher.,"Unilever insists it will not close offices or move jobs due to the merger. It’s still a snub for the Netherlands, though. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte – a former Unilever executive – had promised to reform the country’s dividend taxes to lure the company. Though Unilever has pledged to list its foods and refreshment unit in Amsterdam if it is ever spun off, there are no plans to do so.","A simpler structure should make it easier for Jope to spin off Unilever’s tea business and accelerate other disposals or acquisitions. Meanwhile, shareholders who fretted that Unilever was seeking protection from possible hostile takeovers or activist investors in the Netherlands will be reassured that the company remains bound by London’s shareholder-friendly regime.","At best, however, Unilever will still have faced two years of delay. As Polman was preparing his doomed plan in 2018, another Anglo-Dutch business, the information group RELX, merged into a London-listed company. The plan was approved by 99.99% of shareholders on both sides. The lure of the FTSE 100 index remains hard to resist."

Options include a partial or full sale, he said without giving a timeframe.","The company said the review was triggered by the sales slowdown of traditional black tea in developed markets as consumers shift towards herbal tea. Black tea is the dominant part of Unilever’s tea business, Pitkethly said, selling in 60 countries and generating 3 billion euros ($3.3 billion) in annual sales.","Unilever has been suffering elsewhere, too, with stuttering growth in India and China, two of its biggest emerging markets, while intense competition in North America and Europe has also hampered efforts to hit full-year growth targets.","“The decision to launch a strategic review of its tea business reflects an attempt under CEO Alan Jope to reposition the company towards areas of higher potential after a period in which growth has been harder to come by,” said AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould.",The food and refreshment business - which makes Lipton teas and Hellmann’s mayonnaise among other products and contributes 40% to group sales - has been hit particularly hard in North America and Europe as consumers reach for healthier options.,"“We are pleased to see some progress on the disposals strategy,” Liberum analyst Anubhav Malhotra said of the review, while Jefferies analysts said it could kickstart further moves to unlock value in the food and refreshment division.","Six months after taking the helm in January last year Jope announced his attention to target sustainability even at the cost of losing some revenue. The CEO said he would streamline Unilever’s vast portfolio by focusing on what he described as “brands with purpose”, adding that these were its fastest-growing assets.","The so-called brands with purpose, including Dove, Knorr and Persil, contributed almost two thirds of revenue and drove 75% of sales growth in the first half of 2019, the company said. Brands thought to be among those that didn’t have purpose were Marmite, Magnum Ice Cream and Pot Noodle.","There have been no disposals as yet, though rivals Nestle NESN.S and ABInBev ABI.BR have each sold food operations worth billions of dollars over the past year to refocus on their core businesses.","The maker of products as diverse as Dove soap and Ben & Jerry’s ice cream reported fourth-quarter underlying sales up by a slightly better than expected 1.5%, though this was still the slowest quarterly growth since at least 2009.",Graphic: Estimated impact on Unilever from F&R disposals -,"“There is no clarity around the two key issues: how will sales growth rise back to the top end of the 3-5% target range, and is this something management are focusing on, or are their 2020 margin targets more of a focus,” said Freddie Lait, founder of Unilever shareholder Latitude Investment Management.","Jope’s focus, however, is on growth, he said on Thursday after the results from his first full year in charge showed annual turnover grew 2% while underlying sales gained 2.9%.","“If it does come to a trade-off between margin and growth, we will certainly prioritize growth,” he told analysts.",On its long-term outlook the company said it would step up execution and improve brand awareness and availability while seeking to accelerate innovation in on-trend areas such as plant-based foods.,"Shares in Unilever were up 1.5% at 45.06 pounds by 1252 GMT, the second-biggest gainer on the blue-chip FTSE 100 index .FTSE.","The stock is up 11% over the past year, slightly outperforming the FTSE 100, which has been roiled in recent weeks by growing concerns over the potential economic damage from the coronavirus outbreak in China.",Unilever said the impact of the coronavirus outbreak was too early to quantify but it could affect a fifth of its China professional food service business because fewer people will eat out.

The $161 billion maker of Bovril meat paste warned revenue in 2019 will grow below its 3%-5% target. Lucky that CEO Alan Jope doesn’t have the likes of Dan Loeb’s Third Point snapping at him, like Swiss rival Nestlé. But channelling the spirit of an activist would help avoid any more misses.","Jope blames the economic slowdown in south Asia, one of Unilever’s largest markets, and trading conditions in west Africa for the miss. But neither of these issues are new, making it hard to blame them entirely for the sudden revision to 2019 targets just 14 days before the end of the year. And even the revised target has been flattered by temporary factors: a change in the way Unilever accounts for hyperinflation added 30 basis points to sales growth in the first half, for example.","Unilever’s problems run deeper than temporary slowdowns. Consumer goods groups are facing stiff competition from smaller, nimbler players and changing consumer tastes. And the Anglo-Dutch company’s sprawling network of local brands doesn’t seem to benefit much from being part of a larger entity, as it grows in line with or slower than the market. The activist remedy, as adopted by Nestlé, is to sell the weaker or smaller brands, and focus on strengthening what’s left. Jope’s predecessor, Paul Polman, took some steps in this direction when he sold off the spreads business in 2017.","To be fair to Jope, he has only been in the job for less than a year. And he is open to disposals, telling investors as recently as November that he was evaluating all Unilever’s brands, and that there were no “sacred cows”. Yet he could outline what he plans to sell. Liberum analysts say the food division has seven big brands, including Ben and Jerry’s ice cream and soup maker Knorr, which make up 70% of the business.

Like its Swiss rival Nestlé, the Anglo-Dutch giant beat sales growth forecasts in the first quarter by growing its top line 3.1 percent on a like-for-like basis, according to Thursday’s report. New Chief Executive Alan Jope is sticking with his targets for the year and, like Nestlé, to a 20 percent operating margin goal by 2020. Beauty and homecare are doing fine, but Unilever’s foods and refreshment segment is looking less fresh.","In Jope’s first quarter in charge, the food division’s sales grew just 1.5 percent organically from a year earlier – down from a 2.3 percent expansion in 2018. While ice cream, which includes fast-growing Ben & Jerry’s, performed well, sales in tea and savoury items were flat. The category including ketchup and mayonnaise declined. The acquisition of nuts and healthy snack company Graze, announced in February, was a nod to consumer trends. But while the deal value was not disclosed, old revenue figures for Graze suggest it was a very small step.","Packaged victuals are tricky overall but food-heavy Nestlé, with overall underlying growth of 3.4 percent year-on-year in the first quarter, seems to do better at refreshing its range. For example, it recently used its meats division, which is now for sale, to launch vegan meat substitutes.","Jope is awake to the trends, pointing out that healthier green teas are among the fastest growing Lipton brands. Yet slowing food sales growth suggests he’s not acting fast enough. That helps explain the rival companies’ respective valuations. The $165 billion Unilever trades at an enterprise value of around 15 times EBITDA compared to close to 17 times for $289 billion Nestlé, according to Refinitiv data.","To be fair, Unilever is shifting gradually away from foods and towards faster-growing beauty and personal care, which includes brands such as Dove and Simple. It sold its Flora-making spreads unit last year. But foods and refreshment still represents 36 percent of Unilever’s turnover, on first-quarter numbers. The required diet may involve selected healthier acquisitions like Graze – and cutting out more existing lines that aren’t worth their salt."

Its Anglo-Dutch quarry’s stock also got a boost. How the tables have turned. The Cheez Whiz giant has melted down since offering to buy Unilever: its $40 billion market value is now just a quarter of its erstwhile prey’s. Unilever, meantime, has blossomed into a $155 billion behemoth.","The Kraft-Unilever merger dance was a short one – lasting one long weekend in February 2017. But it unlocked a broader debate about the appropriate model for a modern corporation. Is the role of the company, as the monetarist Milton Friedman argued decades ago, solely to produce profit, and pay dividends, to shareholders? Or must it consider other constituents, like workers, the communities in which it operates and the environment – as well as stock owners?","The divergent fortunes of Kraft and Unilever since their dalliance would suggest the Friedman view embraced by Kraft’s top owners is outdated, and the more expansive one, which undergirded Unilever’s lightning defense against Kraft’s bid, is ascendant. But in that brief interlude when Unilever was forced to weigh all its strategic options, one that emerged is what investment bankers call a “Pac-Man defense,” where a takeover target flips the script and bids for its would-be acquirer.","Chicago-based Kraft is a shell of its former financial self. The rent-seeking, dividend-paying model of its overlords at Brazilian investment group 3G, with an assist from Warren Buffett’s investment company Berkshire Hathaway, appears to be in tatters. What better way for Unilever to show the world that its more inclusive form of capitalism is dominant than to pounce on Kraft, revive the business and make a fortune for shareholders all at once?","Unilever can afford to swallow the much-diminished Kraft, led by 3G partner Bernardo Hees. In a straight takeover, rather than a merger like the one Kraft sort-of proposed two years ago, Unilever would also be in a prime position to call the shots, and export its culture and management approach – one where growth is not sacrificed at the altar of cost savings. Nonetheless, there would be copious synergies to harvest from combining overlapping functions, from corporate overheads to global procurement.","Consider the arithmetic of a hypothetical Unilever bid mimicking Kraft’s from two years ago. At a 20 percent premium to current market prices, a bit more than the markup Kraft offered, a deal would cost Unilever about $48 billion. At the same ratio of cash and stock as Kraft had proposed, that would leave Unilever needing to hustle up $29 billion in cash. That would take the debt load of the combined group close to a punchy $80 billion, or more than four times EBITDA for this year, according to I/B/E/S estimates from Refinitiv. But with as much as $4 billion worth of cost savings potentially achievable, the ratio might drop to below 3.5 times EBITDA.","And there are other ways to reduce indebtedness. Buffett might be persuaded to take only equity. Perhaps even 3G could do the same. Together they own 49 percent of Kraft. That would bring debt to well below three times EBITDA. And then there are potential disposals of parts of Kraft. Unilever, for instance, might want to focus on its Hellmann’s mayonnaise and jettison Kraft’s Miracle Whip. Or it might sell its Maille brand of Dijon mustard to focus on Kraft’s Grey Poupon, and so on and so forth.","Which gets to the reason Unilever would probably decide against a bid: Kraft’s portfolio. Many Kraft brands – think Velveeta, Oscar Mayer and Jell-O - give off a bouquet of flavor attributes that might best be described as over-processed, under-nourishing and ultra-long shelf-life. Revenue excluding rebates and returns at Kraft rose just 0.8 percent in 2018.","Unilever has some more appealing food brands, for sure, like Ben & Jerry’s and Magnum ice creams. And its consolidated underlying sales growth, adjusted for the divestiture of its margarine-spreads business, came to 3.1 percent for 2018. But the victuals line’s growth, at 2 percent, lagged beauty and personal care, at 3.1 percent; and home care, which grew 4.2 percent. Even if Unilever could get Kraft’s food businesses to grow at the same rate as its own, a deal would drag down the overall top line. All of which raises the question of why Unilever is in the edibles business at all.","That’s a matter the company’s new chief executive, Alan Jope, will need to address when he takes over at May’s annual meeting. While the Scotsman looks as if he might enjoy a Magnum or two, he ascends to the top job after running the bigger arm that includes Dove soap and Axe body wash. Snagging Kraft, while it’s cheap, might make a nice prelude to splitting the whole food complex off down the road."

That angered UK-based shareholders as Unilever would have left the UK FTSE 100 share index, forcing some to sell.","Unilever’s board, led by Chairman Marijn Dekkers, ditched the HQ move plan on Oct. 5 after it became clear that it could fall short of the investor approval needed.",Dekkers denied the row had accelerated Polman’s retirement.,"“The appointment of Alan Jope as the successor of Paul has nothing to do with the simplification process,” he told reporters on Thursday.","Polman’s decision to retire was not unexpected and the board had started a process a year ago to consider appropriate replacements, Dekkers added.","“That’s why we were able to appoint Alan immediately,” he said.",Polman’s reputation as a champion of issues like sustainability and the company’s social impact wasn’t always appreciated. Bernstein analyst Andrew Wood said some investors were irked by what they considered a “preachy” style but added that Polman had a strong record over the past decade.,"“Just like one of Unilever’s highest profile products, Marmite, Polman engenders strongly differing opinions from investors,” Wood said.","“We consider that Polman has been an exceptionally good CEO of Unilever,” Wood added.","Dekkers said that Jope’s appointment “stands for continuity”, reassuring investors that the company was on track to meet guidance set by Polman, that includes a target for underlying operating margin of 20 percent by 2020.",Unilever investor Skagen Global Fund said it hoped that Jope would build on Polman’s legacy.,"“Jope is an impressive executive and we congratulate the board on an excellent choice of successor,” Skagen Global fund portfolio manager Knut Gezelius said.",“Choosing Jope over presumably a long list of strong external candidates is another testament to the strength of the internal bench and management quality at Unilever.”,"The appointment of Jope rebalances the Anglo-Dutch leadership of the company in favor of the British-side. While Dekkers is Dutch, Unilever’s Chief Financial Officer Graeme Pitkethly is also British.",Dekkers said that nationality played no role in how Unilever made appointment decisions.,"Pitkethly, who was involved in the media campaign defending the plan to move the HQ, had also been rumored as a possible replacement for Polman.",Jope joined Unilever as a graduate trainee in 1985. He will be paid a fixed salary of 1.45 million euros ($1.65 million) plus a target annual bonus of 150 percent of fixed pay in his new role as CEO.,"Investors will not have to wait long for a chance to quiz the company on its future - Unilever is due to hold an investor day in Mumbai, India on Dec. 4 and 5.","On the new CEO's agenda will be Unilever's bid for GlaxoSmithKline's GSK.L Indian Horlicks nutrition business, where it is competing against consumer giant Nestle NESN.S, as well as handling any fallout from a possible no-deal Brexit as Britain is due to leave the EU in March 2019.","Polman, who was paid a fixed annual salary of 1.4 million pounds but with bonuses took home a total package of about 10 million pounds, will stay on for six months to support Jope’s transition into the role, Unilever added in its statement.","Shares in Unilever traded 0.2 percent higher in midafternoon. The stock has risen 170 percent since Polman took the top job, outperforming Britain's bluechip index .FTSE which is up about 75 percent."

The consumer giant’s new chief executive can cruise until 2020, but may then have to revisit controversial reforms to its dual-share structure.","Change at the top of the 130 billion euro company was expected: the Anglo-Dutch group has been planning for current boss Paul Polman’s retirement for a while. Jope, a Unilever lifer who runs its biggest division, beauty and personal care, takes over at the beginning of next year and will have Polman on hand for six months to help with the transition.","Jope will change little in the short term. Unilever’s strategy of raising its operating margin to 20 percent by 2020, from 17.5 percent last year, is sound. Its Amsterdam-listed shares have risen 4 percent this year compared with a one-third decline for Warren Buffett-backed Kraft-Heinz, which tried to buy Unilever last year. And Jope has the right skills to deliver Polman’s plan. His personal care business grew nearly 3 percent in 2017 excluding currency moves and M&A - faster than the second-biggest business food’s 1 percent expansion. Its 2017 operating margin of 21.1 percent is above where the whole group needs to be by 2020.","His challenge comes after that date. Unilever’s older businesses are growing more slowly than new entrants who can sell directly to consumers and also losing pricing power. Brokers Bryan, Garnier & Co reckon price hikes boosted sales by about 3.3 percent in 2012 but only 0.2 percent in the first half of 2018. Currently Unilever buys smaller business and folds them into the group’s vast marketing and distribution networks. Still, analysts expect its sales to barely grow next year, according to Refinitiv estimates.",One solution is to buy more brands in faster-growing businesses like skincare and vitamins. But Jope’s ability to pay for deals with shares will be constrained by Unilever’s odd dual-share structure. That was part of Polman’s reasoning for trying earlier this year to collapse the group into a single Dutch holding. That plan went nowhere because of a bruising fight with British fund managers who would have had to sell shares in the solely listed Dutch entity. Expect round two in 2020 after Jope has found his feet.

Charging more for products helped Unilever and Nestlé boost underlying revenue by 3.8 percent and 2.8 percent, respectively, in the third quarter. Both need the hikes to offset rising costs. The risk is that price-conscious customers go elsewhere.","Rising commodity prices can hit consumers’ pockets in multiple ways. The prospect of a barrel of oil once again rising above $80 is pushing up the cost of myriad products including water bottles and containers for Dove shampoo. Unilever and Nestlé had previously swallowed these extra expenses, but now they are passing them on. The Swiss giant has raised the price of sparkling water brands including Perrier and S.Pellegrino by 2.3 percent this year. Anglo-Dutch Unilever increased overall prices by 1.4 percent in the third quarter.","With wages on the rise in the United States, China and even Europe, consumers should be able to pay a bit more. And it’s not just about charging more for ice cream. Unilever and Nestlé are also deploying their hefty marketing budgets to persuade customers to trade up to more expensive brands. In India, Unilever is pushing customers to try Surf Excel laundry detergent, which is nearly double the price of its cheaper Wheel brand. Nestlé’s “premiumisation” strategy involves flogging organic and flavoured coffee.",The question is how much customers will put up with. Smaller and nimbler private companies are attempting to undercut larger global brands. Economic turmoil in developing markets like Turkey also hurts revenue growth.,"For now, the approach is working. Despite higher prices, Unilever boosted sales volumes by 2.4 percent in the three months to September. That’s necessary if the company is to hit its operating margin target of 20 percent. The strategy is effectively a test of whether, after a long period of subdued inflation, developed economies can cope with rising prices. It’s not just shareholders in large consumer goods companies who will be watching."

However, his campaign lacks punch. A growing number of voters declare their dissent. As the ballot approaches, the result is too close to call.","The parallels between Unilever’s failed plan to shift its head office to Rotterdam and Britain’s Brexit referendum are almost too neat. Chief Executive Paul Polman’s belief that UK shareholders would meekly approve the plan echoes Prime Minister David Cameron’s hubris in promising a referendum on membership of the European Union. Both were surprised by the force of the opposition, and failed to make a compelling case. The only difference is that the Anglo-Dutch giant’s board on Friday withdrew its proposal, just three weeks before the vote.","The Bovril-to-Ben & Jerry’s group’s bungled move offers two broad lessons. First, it demonstrates the limited scope for multinationals to boss politicians around. Polman turned the choice of a global headquarters into a contest between governments in London and The Hague. Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte – a former Unilever human resources manager – helped swing the decision by promising to scrap the country’s withholding tax on dividends. That sparked a parliamentary rebellion. Now that Rutte can no longer point to Unilever’s arrival as a reason to approve the policy, he may have to perform a U-turn.","The second takeaway is that investors can exert their authority by joining forces. Some UK shareholders objected to Unilever dropping out of the benchmark FTSE 100 index, which would have forced them to sell their shares. Others worried that choosing Rotterdam would allow Unilever to shelter behind Dutch protections against unwanted takeovers, even though the company insisted it would not. But the biggest objection was that the $146 billion company offered few positive reasons for the change. A protest vote therefore carried little cost: Unilever’s London-listed shares fell just 0.5 percent on Friday morning.","Unlike Cameron, Polman probably won’t resign right away. But the Dutchman who has been CEO for almost a decade was already expected to step down next year. This setback will tarnish his legacy. Meanwhile UK shareholders – like Britons who voted to leave the European Union – are unsure what to do next. The debate over Unilever’s dual structure is unresolved. Another referendum seems likely."

The stated aim was to make it more efficient and agile in a consumer market rocked by e-commerce, social media and upstart rivals.","But at least 10 shareholders, which collectively own around 12 percent of Unilever PLC, had publicly opposed the move. They were worried about the effective forced selling of their shares with no premium, uncertainty around the future tax treatment of Dutch dividends and a perception that the move was partly aimed at securing greater takeover protection under Dutch law.","Unilever’s U-turn comes at a sensitive time for the British government, which is battling to protect jobs and investment as Prime Minister Theresa May fights for her proposed divorce plan from the European Union.","“The UK is one of the best places in the world to grow a business, and our modern Industrial Strategy commits us to being an open and competitive economy and a great place to locate global headquarters,” Business Secretary Greg Clark said.","Even with a single corporate entity domiciled in the Netherlands, Unilever was keeping two of its three business units in Britain, allowing it to maintain its UK staff of 7,300.","In the Netherlands, the decision has triggered political fallout for Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte over his unpopular proposal to scrap a withholding tax on dividends that was seen as helping to woo Unilever.",He said on Friday the government was reconsidering the plan.,"Deputy Finance Minister Menno Snel said the Dutch cabinet was meeting to discuss the consequences. “We would have liked to have seen this turn out differently,” he told reporters.","Unilever’s exit from the FTSE would have forced funds mandated to track the index to sell their shares. That may have pressured the price for the remaining shareholders, some of whom worried that shares in the new Unilever would be less liquid.","The plan’s highest hurdle was that it needed backing of a majority of UK shareholders, holding at least 75 percent of the shares. Those two conditions meant that small shareholders, often overlooked, could have swung the vote.","As such, a number of independent investors holding their shares in nominee accounts had contacted their administrators in recent days to make adjustments needed to vote themselves, according to two trading platforms.","The Investor Forum, which works to escalate investor","concerns to companies, said it worked with over 20 institutions on this issue.","“This demonstrates the value of asset managers actively engaging with their investee companies,” said Rupert Krefting, head of corporate governance and stewardship, at M&G Investments, which opposed the proposal.","Unilever took the unusual step of putting a full-page advert in the British press to try to sell the idea to skeptical investors, and executives gave a round of interviews last week to make their point.",But on Friday Unilever recognized that the proposal had not received support from a significant group of shareholders.,"“The board will now consider its next steps and will continue to engage with our shareholders,” Dekkers said, adding Unilever will proceed with the plan to cancel its Dutch preference shares.","Earlier this week, influential proxy advisory firm PIRC recommended shareholders vote against the move.","Another service, IVIS - the corporate governance research service of the Investment Association - issued a “red top” recommendation on the move on Friday, its strongest level of concern.",Sources said Unilever saw the writing on the wall.,"“It’s always common for a vote to be pulled when it’s going to lose,” said Tim Bush, head of governance and financial analysis at PIRC.",Unilever's Anglo-Dutch structure dates back to 1929 when British soap maker Lever Brothers combined with Dutch margarine company Margarine Unie.

One concern is whether future dividends paid to UK shareholders will be subject to Dutch withholding tax. The government in the Netherlands has promised to abolish the levy, but is facing opposition. Investors will have to decide whether to back Unilever before the Dutch Senate votes on the tax bill in December.",Unilever has a backup plan to sidestep the tax by distributing capital rather than paying dividends out of earnings. But it can’t to do this forever.

Tide, also known as Ariel, has 14.3 percent of the global laundry care market versus Omo's 5.2 percent, Euromonitor International says.","For decades, Unilever and P&G have pitched new and improved laundry detergents and fabric softeners, primarily to women using washing machines. But millennials are less loyal to traditional brands and have new demands, including that products save time and be environmentally sustainable.","Many, like 36-year-old Olivia Tusinski, want to spend as little time as possible on laundry. Plus, washing too often wears your clothes out faster, she says.","“I don’t like to waste water or energy,” said Tusinski, a government employee in London.",P&G tested a line to woo the wash-weary a decade ago after discovering how common re-wearing clothes was. The Swash brand was parlayed into a $499 de-wrinkling appliance in partnership with Whirlpool but two products made it to market as Downy Wrinkle Releaser spray and Tide Stain Pen.,"Now, Unilever is having a go with Day 2, an aerosol spray that went on sale online only last week that it says refreshes, reshapes and dewrinkles clothes on the chairdrobe, using technology like fabric-stiffening molecules.","There are versions for denim and delicates, in addition to the original. Denim jeans are by far the most reworn garment, Unilever says. “That’s a high pride point for a lot of millennials, you know, ensuring that their denim is as pristine as possible,” said Day 2’s co-founder and marketing head Nathan Olivieri.","Denim aficionados have warned for years against washing jeans. Levi Strauss CEO Chip Bergh, a 28-year veteran of P&G, told a conference in 2014 that the jeans he was wearing that day were a year old and had never been washed.","Unilever’s home care president Kees Kruythoff calls catering to millennials’ mindset a way of “future-proofing” the portfolio. In addition to Day 2 in the United Kingdom, Unilever is testing a portion-controlled detergent in the Netherlands called Less. Both projects have been structured as if the developers were small and agile start-ups, not a multinational.","The global laundry detergent market is expected to reach $205.2 billion by 2025, up from $133.3 billion in 2016, according to Grand View Research, which predicts 4.9 percent annual growth fueled by the rising penetration of washing machines in developing countries.","In more developed markets, growth is helped by eco-friendly brands like Seventh Generation, now owned by Unilever, and Method, Grand View said.","These upstart brands, which boast fewer chemicals and packaging with recycled plastic, are part of the wave of disruption that earlier slammed food and personal care and has finally shaken up home care.","Laundry leaders P&G, Unilever and Henkel HNKG_p.DE are aiming to save consumers time with pre-measured or all-in-one offerings. Meanwhile, start-up subscription brands deliver soap to consumers' homes, while new mobile apps offer laundry services on demand.",Unilever’s detergent Skip has partnered in Paris with the mobile app Cowash to connect people with neighbors willing to wash and iron their laundry for a fee.,"Cowash says about 80 percent of its customers have washing machines and wash some of their clothes, but use the service to avoid time-consuming items like shirts that need ironing.","“They don’t do it because they don’t have washing machines, they do it because they don’t have time,” Cowash founder Adrien Hugon said.","Indeed, the project brief Unilever handed down to Olivieri some 10 months ago was to create a product that would give millennials more confidence to rewear worn clothes, since there was nothing on the market that explicitly targeted the issue and addressed smell, wrinkles and shape, the 25-year-old told Reuters.","While P&G’s Febreze spray can be used to remove odours from clothes, for example, it more often focuses on hard-to-clean fabrics in the home or car such as upholstery and curtains.","Over the course of one month last autumn, Olivieri’s ten-person team developed the brand away from corporate headquarters in a rented house in a village outside Liverpool, frequently inviting consumers in for real-time feedback.",The project is representative of how Unilever is approaching new brand development with research that engages consumers early in the process.,"The premium all-in-one product is delivered in packaging meant to be attractive enough to be displayed in a bedroom, Olivieri said. It’s a proposition that was never going to be cheap: a 200-ml can that can treat 25 garments costs 7.50 pounds ($9.68), compared to the roughly 7 pounds it costs to buy enough of Unilever’s Persil Powercaps to wash 30 loads of laundry.","“We know the chairdrobe is a universal concept ... but as we move into a modern age where we’re more time-poor than ever, that’s becoming an even more relevant consumer problem,” Olivieri said."
