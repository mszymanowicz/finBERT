It involves a short sea crossing between Dublin and Holyhead in Wales and then a hop between Dover and Calais. Every year 150,000 lorries would use the route.","But post-Brexit paperwork and delays in customs clearance are snarling up the process, adding hours or days to journeys and ratcheting up costs. Many companies are switching routes.","“This is a game-changer,” said Chris Smyth, commercial director at Ireland’s Perennial Freight. Demand was huge for freight space to ship to Cherbourg, Dunkirk, Rotterdam and Zeebrugge, he added.","Cherbourg’s business before Brexit had been evenly split between Ireland and Britain. Now, the port would orient itself towards Ireland, Millet said.","“I thought traffic would double but it has tripled,” he said. “The question now is whether the traffic volumes we see today will hold in the months to come.”","Stena Line, the largest Irish Sea operator, has doubled its services on the booming Rosslare-Cherbourg route, temporarily cancelling some sailings to Britain after freight volumes fell 60% in the first half of January.","Irish Ferries has deployed a larger vessel out of Dublin and planned to add more weekly rotations next month, the Port of Cherbourg said. Brittany Ferries also brought forward a planned sailing linking France and Ireland.",Danish operator DFDS said the freight ferries plying its new 23-hour crossing from Rosslare to Dunkirk six days a week were “pretty much full”. Route director Aidan Coffey said capturing 30% of “land bridge” traffic would make the route viable and DFDS might soon add up to two more sailings per week.,"“We’re blown away by the demand,” Coffey said.",No one knows if the shift is permanent.,"The Irish Maritime Development Office, a government shipping promotion body, said a return to pre-Brexit logistic chains would depend on the speed of customs formalities along the land bridge and that ferries linking Ireland and mainland Europe could not replicate its volumes.","Eddie Burke, a senior official at Ireland’s transport department, said the route through Britain would undoubtedly come back into play again.","Ferry operators were taking decisions on capacity week by week, said Ole Bockmann, Stena’s operations chief in Cherbourg. Reverting to land bridge routes was simple, he said. “We just take the ships off and go back to the old system.”",It gives ports like Cherbourg and Ireland’s Rosslare a narrow window to persuade traders that the longer sea crossing between Ireland and mainland Europe is commercially viable for just-in-time logistics.,"Eighteen months ago, Rosslare on the southeastern tip of Ireland was struggling. Its traffic volumes were stagnant while rivals were enjoying a 10-year run of growth.","Now its general manager, Glenn Carr, is fending off complaints about the number trucks passing through after freight traffic increased 500% in the first half of January.","Carr said the old perception that direct crossings from Ireland were too long for fresh food and just-in-time supply chains was changing. Many of the companies that had switched from the land bridge would remain, he forecast.","“I was talking to some multinationals only this week and the question they asked me was, ‘Glenn, are you putting on more services?’”","An 18-hour ferry ride away, Cherbourg port’s Millet said his immediate priority was responding to shipping companies demands for better restaurants and washrooms for truckers and ironing out quayside glitches in the loading of extra vessels.","“Brexit has for us been an opportunity to rethink our port,” he said."

LOUIS (Reuters) - St. Louis Federal Reserve President James Bullard said on Tuesday that he had been approached by the White House about a possible seat on the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, but said he would not consider leaving his current job.","Bullard said the conversations occurred “in recent months” as President Donald Trump pressed the Fed to reduce interest rates and considered candidates for two open board seats.

I am happy in my current position,” Bullard said in remarks to reporters ahead of an event at the St. Louis Fed. “I think these kinds of discussions are exploratory in nature and it’d be very unclear whether it would go any further.”","Trump has grown increasingly critical of Fed Chairman Jerome Powell in recent months, slamming him for steering the Fed to hike interest rate four times last year, which the president says has curbed economic growth and made it harder for him to negotiate a trade deal with China.",But Trump has also struggled to fill two open seats on the Fed’s seven-member board. Fed governors set interest-rate policy along with five of the 12 reserve bank presidents who rotate through voting seats on the central bank’s rate-setting committee; the two appointees on their own would have a limited voice in the matter.,Members of the Board of Governors are appointed by the president and are subject to Senate confirmation. The heads of the 12 regional banks are nominated by the directors of the local Fed boards and require no such confirmation.,"Trump hopes to have nominees for the open Board of Governor seats soon, an administration official said on Tuesday.","Bullard, who holds a doctorate in economics, would check a number of boxes for Trump as a candidate whose deep experience in central banking would likely clear the Senate, and who also argued early on that the Fed should stop hiking rates.","Bullard, who currently holds a vote on the Fed’s rate-setting committee, said in comments to reporters that he felt the Fed should make an initial reduction of a quarter of a percentage point at an upcoming meeting, and make a second reduction later in the year. That, he said, would set the stage for an economic “soft landing” and help ensure continued growth into 2020.","“I felt we are a little bit restrictive,” Bullard said. “If you went one move now and another later you would be slightly accommodative and that would shore up” the outlook for inflation and growth.","Trump’s two candidates for the open board seats withdrew from consideration earlier this year, after some Republican senators expressed reservations, indicating that both would likely struggle to win confirmation in the Republican-controlled Senate.","Herman Cain, the former head of the Godfather’s Pizza restaurant chain who had made a bid for the presidency in 2012 was a public advocate of many of Trump’s policies, withdrew from consideration in late April. In early May, economics commentator Stephen Moore also withdrew from consideration after weeks of criticism about his political partisanship, shifting views on rate policy and sexist comments about women."

They have surcharges to help cover the extra expense, but retailers are pushing back as they work to lower the cost of ever-faster - and still free - shipping, said Satish Jindel, founder of ShipMatrix.","The lower-cost, part-time drivers will use company vehicles, receive no benefits, work no more than four weekly shifts, and be paid $17.10 per hour in most markets - including Paducah, Kentucky; Roswell, New Mexico; and Jacksonville, Florida.

Those low-cost gig workers help open up Amazon’s delivery markets. They also handle overflow and re-deliveries from the independent van owners that Amazon hires for daily routes.","“It sounds to me like they’re moving toward the gig economy,” John Haber, chief executive of consultancy Spend Management Experts, said of FedEx Express.","The project comes as Don Colleran - who was appointed CEO of FedEx Express in March - works to turn around the division now grappling with higher-than-expected costs related to integrating its European TNT Express business, a cooling global economy, and margin-squeezing e-commerce growth.",Haber and other consultants said the new part-time drivers could support FedEx Express’ “Extra Hours” service that allows retailers like Walmart Inc to fulfill online orders into the evening for next-day local delivery.,"“They’ve got a ton of Walmart business. If these drivers are rural, this fits the Walmart model,” Haber said.",Others said the move takes FedEx in the wrong direction.,"“They should be downsizing the Express network, not expanding it,” said Jindel, who is advocating for FedEx to merge Express with its more efficient North American Ground operation that outsources delivery to a network of independent providers.","“Why don’t they use their Ground contractors to deliver (those packages) for them?” said Jindel, who helped found Roadway Package System (RPS), which was rebranded as FedEx Ground in 2000 - two years after FedEx bought its parent company.","Meanwhile, FedEx Ground is working to ring out more residential profits by shifting the delivery of nearly 2 million SmartPost packages from and the U.S. Postal Service mail carriers to its own drivers.

They expect those calls to intensify after FedEx Corp over the weekend became embroiled in U.S.-China frictions and an ongoing spat over Chinese tech giant Huawei.,"Further rattling nerves are Beijing’s plans to unveil an unprecedented hit-list of “unreliable” foreign firms, groups and individuals that harm the interests of Chinese companies. China’s commerce ministry announced the move on Friday without singling out any country or company.","The US-China Business Council (USCBC), which represents roughly 200 American companies that do business in China, told Reuters on Monday that anxiety among its members was on the rise, especially over the list.","“The key point for them is that there’s a great deal of uncertainty on how the list will be implemented and what negative repercussions will be brought about should a company be added to the list,” said its vice president of China operations, Jacob Parker.","“At the moment many of our companies are wondering whether this is an attempt by the Chinese government to increase their potential leverage in the trade negotiations, or if it’s an actual effort to force companies into an unenviable position of choosing between the two markets.”","Analysts said U.S. companies had been more sanguine in the initial stage of the trade war, with many believing that it could not possibly go on, but that began to change after Washington last month accused Beijing of reneging on previous promises, prompting fresh tit-for-tat tariffs.","The United States also last month put China’s Huawei on a blacklist that effectively blocks U.S. firms from doing business with the Shenzhen-based telecoms equipment maker, aggravating existing frictions.","“We have in the last three weeks fielded more calls from firms wondering about the political risk here than we probably have in the last 10 years,” said Ben Cavender, an analyst at China Market Research Group, whose clients have ranged from clothing retailers to chemical firms.","“Right now there’s a lot more concern that the situation regarding the negotiations has become so unstable and so emotional, when or if there’s going to be a resolution.”","It is unclear exactly how many U.S. companies do business with China, but the American Chambers of Commerce (AmCham) in Beijing and Shanghai count more than 2,000 member firms between them.","“This is a discouraging development,” said AmCham Shanghai President Ker Gibbs. “We are concerned and have requested more information about the list. We hope that both sides can refrain from this type of tit-for-tat behavior and get back to the negotiating table.”",Beijing-based AmCham China did not respond to a request for comment.,"“At least three clients have asked us about how the entity list might affect their business,” said a Shanghai-based consultant, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the situation.","Even some British firms had sought advice, he added, saying they were expressing worry over U.S. President Donald Trump’s visit to Britain this week, when he is expected to demand that Prime Minister Theresa May’s successor ban Huawei from 5G networks.","“They fear that the U.S. president might pressure the incoming prime minister to follow his policies,” the consultant said.","One big concern, analysts said, was that U.S. firms could start to experience similar treatment to that doled out to South Korean companies in 2017, after China opposed Seoul’s decision to install a U.S. missile system.","South Korea’s fifth-largest conglomerate Lotte, was among the worst hit. Chinese authorities suspended its work on a $2.6 billion project and ordered Lotte Mart stores to shut over what they said were fire safety violations. Company officials privately linked the action to the missile spat.","“It would not be inconceivable that China will look at, for example, large retail brands that are operating here and saying, well maybe they should also have fire code violations too. That would create immediate harm to a lot of businesses,” Cavender said.","Another worry is that U.S. corporate officials could personally start to face scrutiny or be investigated in China as a result of the trade frictions, one China-based foreign executive told Reuters on condition of anonymity.","Some, he added, were “exploring summer plans abroad”, having not previously considered doing so, because they were worried about getting caught in the crossfire.",“Many U.S. senior executives in China that I know have this growing concern right now.”

He argues that HP itself, a “vast but floundering company”, botched the acquisition.","Autonomy was a market leader in software for unstructured data, helping companies extract the meaning from emails, video or voice calls, which are hard to analyze in traditional ways.","And Leo Apotheker, architect of the deal and HP’s CEO between November 2010 and September 2011, had sought to boost HP’s languishing profitability by integrating its legacy computer and printer business with higher-margin software.",But the former CEO of Europe’s leading business software group SAP resisted suggestions from Lynch’s defense lawyer in London’s High Court that the acquisition of Autonomy was central to a desperate strategy.,"“Unstructured data was at the center of your plans,” Robert Miles QC, acting for Lynch, told Apotheker, who was called as a witness in the case.","“No, that’s not right, it was part of the plan,” Apotheker said, adding that HP had considered buying either Autonomy or German group Software AG in the first half of 2011, but decided on the British firm because it would provide the “technological uplift” that HP wanted.","It was not clear cut, Apotheker said:","“Looking at financial markets, investors, I think they would have preferred Software AG,” he said.","Apotheker who said in his witness statement that he had “never told the due diligence team to prioritize due diligence of Autonomy’s technology over its financials”, also rejected the idea that HP was in crisis.",“But it wasn’t doing well.

At least nine of the Fed’s 17 policymakers reduced their outlook for the fed funds rate, a comparatively large number.","“It may be some time before the outlook for jobs and inflation calls clearly for a change in policy ,” Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said in a press conference following the policy meeting, at which policymakers reaffirmed they will be “patient” before moving rates again.","“Patient means that we see no need to rush to judgment,” Powell said.","Continued growth and a healthy jobs market remains “the most likely” scenario for the U.S. economy, the Fed’s rate-setting committee said in a policy statement on Wednesday.","But doubts have accumulated, with a slowdown in household spending and business investment at the start of this year possibly signaling an early end to a growth spurt triggered in 2018 by a massive tax cut package and government spending.","The economic projections released on Wednesday showed policymakers at the median see the U.S. economy growing only 2.1 percent in 2019, a full percentage point below the roughly 3 percent growth that was seen in 2018 and which the Trump administration contends will continue.",‘MORE DOVISH’,The new rate view brings the Fed in line with investors who have argued the central bank would not raise rates this year.,"“I didn’t think they’d do it, but they came across as more dovish than what was expected,” said Brian Jacobsen, senior investment strategist for Wells Fargo Asset Management.","The outlook is now also in line with President Donald Trump’s criticism of Fed rate hikes as endangering the recovery, though for the awkward reason that Fed officials do not see his policies having a lasting impact on growth.",Fed funds futures contracts began pricing in a better-than-even chance of a rate cut by next year after the release of the policy statement and projections.,"Powell pushed back on that view, saying the U.S. economy is in a “good place” and that the outlook is “positive.”","Still, he said, there are ongoing risks, including those related to Britain’s exit from the European Union, U.S. trade talks with China, and even the outlook for the U.S. economy, which he said the Fed is watching closely.","“The data are not currently sending a signal that we need to move in one direction or another, in my view,” he said. “It’s a great time for us to be patient.”","Benchmark U.S. stock market indexes swung higher after the Fed’s statement was released before giving up the gains later in the trading session, and key Treasury security yields dropped to the lowest levels since early January. The dollar weakened broadly against major trading partners’ currencies.","“The Fed exceeded markets’ dovish expectations, which took a toll on the greenback,” said Joe Manimbo, senior market analyst at Western Union Business Solutions in Washington. “The Fed did a big about-face on policy. The fact that the Fed threw in the towel on a 2019 rate hike was particularly dovish.”","The new economic projections showed weakening on all fronts compared to the Fed’s forecasts from December. In addition to the growth slowdown, the unemployment rate for 2019 is forecast at 3.7 percent, slightly higher than forecast three months ago.","Inflation for the year is now seen at 1.8 percent, compared to the December forecast of 1.9 percent.","“Growth of economic activity has slowed from its solid rate in the fourth quarter,” the Fed said. “Recent indicators point to slower growth of household spending and business fixed investment in the first quarter ... overall inflation has declined.”"

A business and investment shift away from the firearms industry is happening more subtly. FedEx, the U.S. shipping group, is ending a program that offers discounts for business members of the National Rifle Association, the company confirmed to Breakingviews.","It’s a quiet reversal: eight months ago, FedEx stood by the gun-rights lobby group as other companies scrapped deals. They were reacting to the NRA’s stance after 17 students and staff members were murdered at a Florida high school by a former student. Companies including Delta Air Lines, United Airlines and car-rental firm Enterprise swiftly ended member discounts. At the time, FedEx said that while assault rifles of the kind used in most American mass shootings shouldn’t be in civilian hands, it did not believe in “discriminating” between organizations it works with.","The change of tack comes just days after a gunman killed 11 people in a Pittsburgh synagogue. The $56 billion logistics company says the closure of its NRA discount program from Nov. 4 has no connection to that incident or any other shooting. Rather, the NRA just didn’t bring in enough business to merit its own deal. It’s among dozens of organizations FedEx plans to move to new pricing programs, and the company has been notifying customers since early October.","That, though, is still significant – perhaps more so than largely political gestures. It suggests the NRA no longer has the economic clout to inspire fear in the corporate world. The group nearly put gunmaker Smith & Wesson out of business in 2000 when it branded the company a “sellout” for agreeing to back stronger gun controls. Boycotts from NRA members followed, and Smith & Wesson’s chief executive lost his job.","Gun-rights lobbyists have resisted both technology that could make firearms safer and no-brainer efforts like making more federal data on firearms incidents readily available. But companies are becoming less timid. When retailers Dick’s Sporting Goods, Walmart and Kroger pledged to end sales of assault rifles earlier this year, their shares didn’t suffer. As customers and investors change their views, businesses no longer need to take an overtly political stance – they can just follow the money."

Before this week, the policy rate had approached but never landed on the rate the Fed pays banks on excess reserves (IOER), activated in 2015 to keep the policy rate contained.","The policy rate has drifted higher in its range throughout the year, causing the Fed in June to tweak the IOER lower. To provide a buffer, it now sits 0.05 percent below the upper end of the overall policy range of 2.00-2.25 percent.","The upward drift has renewed a debate over whether the Fed's reduction of its massive bond holdings, which started a year ago, has made it more expensive for banks to borrow excess reserves to meet regulatory requirements or fund their daily needs. (Graphic: Bank excess reserves held at the Fed - tmsnrt.rs/2Jh0PPN)","Reserves have fallen more quickly than the Fed’s portfolio, leading some in the market to believe a scarcity is behind the upward creep in the policy rate, and that the portfolio trimming would have to stop soon. That, in turn, could leave the Fed with a more accommodative policy stance overall.","“If one thought that the drift higher in the funds rate were the result of growing scarcity of reserves in the interbank market, then it would signal to the Fed a need to slow or stop pulling reserves out of the banking system via their balance sheet normalization,” wrote Michael Feroli, chief U.S. economist at JPMorgan.","He added, however, that there was so far “little evidence that reserves are becoming scarce.”",Central bankers agree.,"Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester discussed the issue twice over two days of events in New York, telling investors on Thursday that a series of other one-off factors was driving the policy rate’s upward drift, including the supply of fed funds from government-sponsored home-loan banks.","Another downward tweak to the IOER, to provide more of a buffer, “wouldn’t bother me,” she said. “We can think about that separately from” the ultimate size of the balance sheet and longer-term operating framework, Mester added.","Hours later, at a conference on Friday at the Bank of France in Paris, the Fed official running market operations argued that even if the effective policy rate rose above IOER, it would not signal reserves scarcity. At any rate, it was unrelated to any future decision on how much to shrink the current $4 trillion in bonds on the Fed’s balance sheet, said Simon Potter, executive vice president at the New York Fed.","“Let me be clear: observing the (policy rate) and other rates above the (IOER) is not a sufficient condition for reserve scarcity,” Potter said at the conference.","The Fed bought some $3.5 trillion in bonds to spur recovery from recession in the last decade, leaving it with a total of $4.5 trillion in overall assets as of October last year.","Since then, it has shed some $250 billion, even as bank reserves have dropped by more than twice that value. The Fed has never specified how much it wants to trim its asset holdings."

The insurer has historically competed for pension transfer deals with less than $1 million in premiums, Dargan wrote.","Some life insurers, including Prudential Financial Inc PRU.N and MetLife, take over corporate pension plans from companies that want to offload them. The insurers then use a group annuity to make regular payments to the retirees and beneficiaries who are entitled to benefits under those pensions.","These deals, known as pension risk transfers, have been around for at least 90 years, but rising interest rates and stock market values are expected to make it easier for more companies unload their plans to insurers.","In 2017, MetLife disclosed that it had failed to make payments to pensioners whom it could not locate after taking over their plans from private companies. MetLife since been trying to locate the individuals, whom it intends to pay, the company has said.","The deal “is a vote of confidence after MET’s group annuitant issues and charges of the recent past,” Dargan wrote.","FedEx’s purchase of the group annuity contract will be funded by assets of its pension plan, the company said.","The amount of monthly payments to the pensioners will not change, the companies said."
