Floods in the Midwest hampered Union Pacific’s business in the first half of the year, along with concerns about the trade spat with China.","Fritz would not say how much of Union Pacific’s business originates and terminates in China, but said Asia accounts for an important portion of its revenue.","U.S. exports to China tumbled 30% in the first quarter, while U.S. imports from China fell 9%, according to International Monetary Fund trade data analyzed by trade credit insurance firm Atradius.","That has hit close to home for Union Pacific, which said in April that agricultural shipments from its home state and around the Midwest tumbled since China slapped retaliatory tariffs on U.S. soybeans. The railroad’s agriculture products revenue fell 3% to almost $1.1 billion in the first quarter, hurt by a 7% drop in grain carloads due to reduced exports to China.","The pressure increased on June 1, when Washington hiked tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods to 25% from 10% and Beijing retaliated by boosting tariffs on $60 billion in U.S. goods to 25% from 5%.","The trans-Pacific standoff comes as the railroad, one of the nation’s largest, has been grappling with a softening in the truck market that makes highway shipments more competitive with rail."

Railroads boost profits by lowering their operating ratio.","“Network performance improved significantly coming out of the first quarter, but a tunnel outage and train-crew shortages created a headwind in June,” Chief Executive Officer Lance Fritz said.","A tunnel collapse in Oregon in late May forced the railroad to reroute traffic, which added 4 to 5 days of travel time and sparked a cascade of disruptions and unexpected expenses.","The company, which connects 23 states in the western two-thirds of the United States by rail, warned in April that it was unlikely to achieve an operating ratio of 60 percent in 2019 due to service problems and congestion on its rail network.","Fritz told Reuters on Thursday he was confident the company will hit that target in 2020, primarily through more efficient use of locomotives and crews, increased train sizes and reduced fuel consumption.","Union Pacific’s freight revenue increased 8 percent in the latest quarter, driven by an increase in volume and a 4 percent improvement in average revenue per car.","Still, core pricing was flat sequentially, disappointing analysts and investors who expected an acceleration.","“We would have thought contract renewals and a tighter truck market would be having a greater impact by now,” Bernstein analyst David Vernon said in a note.","Net income increased 29 percent to $1.51 billion, or $1.98 per share, helped by an effective tax rate that dropped to 22.1 percent from 37.5 percent a year earlier. Revenue rose 8 percent to $5.67 billion.","Analysts, on average, expected profit of $1.95 per share on revenue of $5.66 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.",Shares in the company fell $1.97 to $139.28.,"Rival CSX Corp CSX.O, which is in the middle of an aggressive turnaround effort, on Tuesday posted a second-quarter profit that topped estimates as its operating ratio fell more than expected to 58.6 percent from 67.4 percent a year ago."

In the first quarter, Union Pacific reported an operating ratio of 64.6 percent, compared with 65.2 percent from a year ago.","But Chief Financial Officer Robert Knight said on a post-earnings call with analysts the railroad was unlikely to achieve an operating ratio of 60 percent given service problems and congestion on its network, which spans the western half of the United States.","Union Pacific, Norfolk Southern Corp NSC.N and other top U.S. railroads are facing scrutiny from the nation's top federal rail regulator over persistent service complaints.",Chief Executive Lance Fritz said in an interview the railroad was working to streamline operations and said strong volumes and other cargo coupled with higher freight rates would drive efficiency.,"“We feel good about our ability to take advantage of the tighter truck market and continue to win really attractive business in the domestic (consumer goods) space,” Fritz said.","Union Pacific, Norfolk Southern and other railroads have benefited from one of the tightest trucking markets in years, which has caused shippers to transfer freight to rail to find capacity and cheaper prices, despite complaints over service delays and rail car shortages.","“Although the market is taking the announcement negatively, with the stronger volumes that Union Pacific is seeing, the company is essentially focusing more on growth and bettering its service,” Edward Jones analyst Dan Sherman said.","Overall freight revenue rose 6.8 percent in the first quarter, led by a 14.6 percent jump from its energy segment, the company said.","Overall volumes, as measured by total revenue carloads, increased 1.8 percent in the quarter, compared with a year earlier.","Net income rose to $1.31 billion, or $1.68 per share, in the latest quarter from $1.07 billion, or $1.32 per share, a year earlier.",Total operating revenue rose 6.7 percent to $5.48 billion.,"Analysts on average had expected profit of $1.66 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S."
