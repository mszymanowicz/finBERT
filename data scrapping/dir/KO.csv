Corporate America's battle with social activism,"(Reuters) - Earlier this year, a flood of major U.S. companies pledged to address racial inequality and promote social justice after Minneapolis police killed George Floyd, a Black man, setting off protests across the country.","Companies that rushed to take a stand include household names like Home Depot Inc, Procter & Gamble Co and Coca-Cola Co. Corporate America pledged billions to promote diversity in employee ranks and the communities in which they operate, including banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co, which recently made a $30 billion commitment over the next five years.","Another set of companies, particularly in Silicon Valley, are turning more cautious, according to interviews with more than a dozen investors, entrepreneurs, executive coaches and recruiters.","Companies and employees should avoid taking public stances that stoke controversy in an increasingly polarized America, proponents of this view and their advisers told Reuters. Instead, they should focus on strategic initiatives and meeting financial targets, they said.","Management teams and boards of directors are discussing how to handle the issue, sources said, with some staying silent as a strategy and others laying out formalized ground rules detailing how executives can discuss sensitive social and political issues.","“People are struggling with employees expecting companies to solve problems that are beyond the purview of the company,” said executive coach Stephen Miles of the Miles Group.","Miles has spoken to at least 10 CEOs in recent weeks who commiserated with Brian Armstrong, the chief executive of Coinbase, whose Sept. 27 blog post explaining why the cryptocurrency company would remain apolitical brought the debate into the public square. (Blog: bit.ly/2IG9BMm)","Coinbase and its employees should pay attention to the corporate “mission” and not delve into broader societal problems that distract and decrease productivity, Armstrong wrote. The company declined to comment further for this story.","After he shared it on Twitter, some founders and former senior executives of prominent tech companies replied supportively. The view may be shared even more widely in corporate America than it appears.","“People aren’t taking a public stand about this, but they are asking about it in the boardroom: ‘What should we do?’” said Kathleen Utecht, managing partner at venture-capital firm Core Innovation Capital.","Utecht agrees with Armstrong. His position is more common than people may realize, she said, especially at smaller companies where management teams do not want to devote limited resources to fixing complex societal issues.","The unprecedented outpour of corporate support for racial justice lately follows several years of companies taking a stand on other issues that activists criticize them about, including climate change, the gender wage gap and LGBTQ rights.","Blue-chip corporations have not wavered from their announcements and smaller companies have taken a stand, too. On Friday, Expensify CEO David Barrett emailed the software company’s 10 million users urging them to vote for Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden.","These declarations get attention, partly because of how unusual they are historically, said Harvard University professor Mike Toffel, who has studied CEO activism. It is more common now than it was five or 10 years ago, but still rare, he said, and the feeling that companies should get involved in politics is far from universal.","“You can count on a couple of hands how many examples you can find,” he said. “Many are not engaging.”","Roughly half of the companies in the Russell 1000 did not make statements about racial inequality last summer, according to preliminary data from As You Sow, a nonprofit that advocates for corporate accountability.","Of those that did make statements, 195 were in hard-to-find locations like a CEO’s LinkedIn page or staff Facebook page, not the corporate website, said Andrew Behar, As You Sow’s chief executive.","Lloyd Carney, a former tech executive who sits on the boards of companies including artificial intelligence provider Nuance Communications Inc, said “smart” companies are taking steps to address social causes internally, but not in a splashy way. That allows them to avoid backlash from employees, customers or politicians, he said.","“It’s one of those things where it’s better to make quiet noise,” said Carney. “A press release is the worst thing you can do in this highly politicized environment.”","About half a dozen companies outside Silicon Valley recently set up “guardrails” for how executives can discuss sensitive social and political issues, like Black Lives Matter, one adviser to boards told Reuters. Executives must make it clear that they are speaking in a personal capacity on certain issues and notify boards about their comments, the adviser said.","For instance, high-tech manufacturer Sono-Tek Corp adopted a similar code of conduct in September that forbids employees from participating in politics on the job or with company resources.","The provision is especially important in today’s tumultuous world and is meant to help employees feel comfortable at work, said the company’s chief financial officer, Steve Bagley.","“Large businesses want people to buy their product, to support their company, whether they are hardcore Democrats or hardcore Republicans, or in between,” said Ronn Torossian, head of 5W Public Relations, who talks to CEOs across a wide swath of industries. “A week doesn’t pass that major companies aren’t discussing this.”"

It promised earlier this month to introduce two new variants of its smartwater brand on the U.S. West coast.,"The strategy, which follows Quincey’s appointment last year, has drawn support from Wall Street analysts and investors.",A 2 percent gain on Tuesday took its shares back into positive territory for this year and compared to a near 6-percent decline for Pepsi and an almost 5- percent drop in the S&P consumer staples index over the same period.,Net income attributable to the company’s shareholders rose 30 percent on the year in the three months ended Sept. 28.,"Excluding one-time items, Coca-Cola said it earned 58 cents per share, beating analysts’ average estimate by 3 cents, according to Refinitiv data.","Revenue fell 9 percent to $8.25 billion, due to the disposal of its low-margin bottling operations, but beat expectations.","“We are impressed with Coca-Cola’s ability to deliver a strong and balanced top line, suggesting that its refranchising and portfolio transformation are paying off,” Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog said."

The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2019.,"Whitbread shares closed 14.3 percent higher following news of the deal, which analysts said was priced at a punchy 16.4 times Costa’s latest annual earnings.","“Coca-Cola are one of the few companies in the world that could justify the valuation,” said Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown.","“Its global reach should turbo-charge growth in the years to come, and hot drinks are one of the few areas of the wider beverages sector where the soft drinks giant doesn’t have a killer brand. Costa will get lots of care and attention.”","Whitbread had been in the process of demerging Costa from its hotel group Premier Inn, and the sale marks the latest transformation in a business that was established in 1742 as a brewer and which has also owned sports clubs and restaurants.","Whitbread bought Costa, founded in 1971 in London by Italian brothers Sergio and Bruno Costa, for 19 million pounds in 1995. It only had 39 shops then, but now its maroon shop front is one of the most ubiquitous sights on British high streets, with 2,422 outlets in the UK and a further 1,399 in international markets, operated as franchises, joint ventures and wholesale outlets.",Whitbread Chief Executive Alison Brittain said the price tag represented “a substantial premium” to what would have been created through a demerger.,“We were not interested in a sale other than to somebody who had a strategic rationale and therefore would be able to create significantly more value than Costa could create on its own.”,"Some of the proceeds will go toward reducing Whitbread’s pension deficit and financial debt to ease expansion of the Premier Inn hotel chain in the UK and Germany, but Brittain said a “significant majority” of the cash would go to shareholders.","Brittain also denied Whitbread had been pressured to accelerate the sale by activist investor Elliott and other hedge funds. “I would imagine they would be as delighted and surprised as anybody else this morning,” she told reporters.",Elliott congratulated the board on the deal and said it “looks forward to continuing to engage with them to maximize the value of the remaining businesses”.,"The global market for packaged coffee and drinks was worth about $83 billion in 2017, a fraction of the $513 billion market for soft drinks, according to Euromonitor International, but it is growing faster. What is more, sales at coffee shops like Starbucks and Costa are growing even faster, as people increasingly indulge their habit on the go, rather than at home.","Costa recently expanded into China to try to offset an increasingly saturated market in Britain, where chains such as Starbucks and Caffe Nero vie with thousands of independents.","A burgeoning cafe culture in China provides an encouraging backdrop, but Costa faces intensifying competition there as well. Starbucks, which has 3,400 stores in China, plans to almost double that by 2022, while partnering with Chinese tech giant Alibaba BABA.N to start delivery services.","Local rival Luckin also plans to more than double its Chinese store count to 2,000 by the end of 2018.","Rothschild advised Coke on the deal while Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank advised Whitbread.",($1 = 0.7679 pounds)
