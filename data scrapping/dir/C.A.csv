Much of what the $150 billion U.S. lender does at the moment is middling. If Fraser can clean up Citi’s tattered image, brilliance could come from bulking up. Otherwise, a breakup could shine more brightly. Both routes come with challenges.","The Scot hinted at the slimming-down approach last week when she said Citi will sell a collectively unprofitable group of retail networks across Asia and Europe, barely two months into her tenure as chief executive. While Fraser isn’t talking about dismantling the empire, which reaped $73 billion in revenue over the last four quarters, it’s worth totting up the value of its three main chunks.",,3 x 1 = 2.5,"Start with Citi’s banking business in the United States. While it’s a huge credit-card issuer, both under its own name and for brands like Best Buy (BBY.N) and Macy’s (M.N), Citi’s assets place it a distant fourth after JPMorgan (JPM.N), Bank of America (BAC.N) and Wells Fargo (WFC.N), according to Federal Reserve data. That jars with Fraser’s claim that she wants Citi’s divisions to occupy market-leading positions.","Even so, it’s a big portion of Citi’s market value. The consumer business makes around $9 billion of operating profit a year before provisions against bad debt. Next-smallest rival U.S. Bancorp (USB.N) trades at 8.7 times its own pre-provision profit. On the same multiple, Citi’s home-turf retail bank could be worth $80 billion.","Then there’s Mexican lender Banamex, which by Fraser’s reckoning has a decent market share of around 20%, plus a selection of Asian credit card and retail bank operations. Collectively they make a little more than $2 billion in net income a year. Put those on a 10 times multiple, roughly where bigger and more efficient rivals Santander Mexico and Banorte trade, and they’re worth $20 billion.","That leaves Citi's institutional business – a trading, lending and cash management beast with tentacles extending across the globe. While Citi doesn’t have the flashiness of Goldman Sachs (GS.N), its corporate connections suggest its $14 billion of institutional net profit over the past four quarters could be valued on a par with Goldman’s 8 times earnings, according to Refinitiv, giving it a value of $110 billion.","Put it all together, and Citi’s parts could be worth over $200 billion, more than a third above its current market value. A broader manifestation of the same problem is that for most of the past decade, Citi’s market capitalization has been less than its net assets, which normally act as a floor for a bank’s valuation.",,BUILDING UP,"To realize some of that buried value, Fraser could go shopping. Put Citi and U.S. Bancorp together, for example, and the result would be a consumer bank with $43 billion of annual revenue, bigger than Bank of America’s business and with more highly profitable credit cards. Citi has branches in places like New York where U.S. Bancorp, which is mostly spread across the Midwest and West Coast, doesn’t.","It would be a quicker way to create a top-ranked U.S. retail presence than fighting for business one person at a time. Fraser thinks she can add customers with apps and digital services, but that’s a slog, and her rivals are all trying to do the same thing. Moreover, crunching together two banking franchises can generate substantial cost savings. In M&T Bank's (MTB.N) deal to buy People’s United Financial (PBCT.O), announced in February, the two reckon on cutting one-third of the smaller bank’s operating costs. In U.S. Bancorp’s case, that would be $4 billion a year.","The problem is that there’s virtually no chance of Washington's regulators letting a company as accident-prone as Citi make a huge acquisition for the next couple of years at least. Recent gaffes include a $400 million fine over its sloppy processes and accidentally wiring nearly $1 billion to a group of hedge funds. In time Fraser might get permission from the regulators to grow to greatness, but only if she can do what her predecessor Mike Corbat didn’t, and keep Citi’s nose clean.",,TAKING DOWN,"If bulking up doesn't work out, Fraser's other option is to shrink. Ditching small markets like Poland and Vietnam, as she is now doing, isn’t really significant. But selling the U.S. consumer bank would be a bold step that might unwind Citi's so-called conglomerate discount, which amounts to a kind of punishment for sprawl inflicted by investors.","Dismantling Citi as aggressively as that would also need to wait, though. The U.S. retail bank's deposits are a cheap form of funding, and there’s no obvious taker, either. Wells Fargo might covet Citi’s credit card business, but Charlie Scharf, the San Francisco-based lender's newish boss, is still trying to mend fences with regulators after his bank’s fraud problems. Retail banking is also a way to snare wealth management customers, which for now is part of Fraser’s grand plan.","Selling Banamex would be an easier interim step towards a more focused bank. But it would only be a start, and Fraser would have to have a bigger plan in mind. The business it's hardest to imagine Citi parting with, and the one that in any case punches its weight, is the institutional behemoth.","In the long term, keeping today's middling Citi muddling along isn't an option. Fraser has one thing in her favor though: investor tolerance. Corbat left an institution that had delivered shareholders a total return of only around a third of what they would have got from Bank of America or JPMorgan during his eight-year tenure. Even then, shareholders weren’t clamoring for a breakup. Fraser has time to think bigger.",,Follow @johnsfoley on Twitter,,"- For previous columns by the author, Reuters customers can click on",

Effectively, Mishra said, the accounts remain frozen until the amount is moved to the state-run bank.","ByteDance in a statement said the court had agreed with the company that its accounts “should be unblocked” and that will allow it to continue operations. “We are prepared to take further steps required by the court and are confident in our position on this tax matter,” it said.",ByteDance did not comment on government counsel Mishra’s statement and it is unclear how the company will deposit the amount ordered by court while also funding operations.,"ByteDance in January reduced its Indian workforce after New Delhi maintained a ban on video app TikTok, imposed last year after a border clash between India and China.

Some, such as Delta Air Lines and Coca-Cola Co., are based in Georgia, where state lawmakers have the power to raise state taxes. Delta CEO Ed Bastian said in a public memo that his decision to speak out was informed by discussions with leaders and employees in the Black community.","The companies criticizing the law so far represent a sliver of the U.S. business landscape. Yet they are part of a growing group of companies shedding their reluctance to speak out on politically controversial social issues that matter to many of their employees and customers globally, business leaders interviewed by Reuters said.","“Young people want more than words, they want action,” Debra Lee, the former chair and CEO of BET Networks, a TV network owned by ViacomCBS Inc, said in an interview on Thursday. ViacomCBS has also criticized the Georgia law.","A new focus from investors on environmental, social and governance issues such as climate change and the Black Lives Matter and #MeToo movements has also emboldened companies.","Recent examples range from companies criticizing former President Donald Trump’s claims of election fraud, to Washington Redskins football stadium sponsor Fedex Corp asking for a team name change. Retailers Walmart Inc and Dick’s Sporting Goods Inc, for example, have adopted new restrictions on gun sales following mass shootings.","Some companies that are reluctant to criticize specific laws or policies are still willing to come out with more general statements. For example, roughly 330 of the 500 companies in the S&P 500 Index issued comments last year in support of social justice in the wake of the death of George Floyd, a Black man, in the custody of Minneapolis police, according to shareholder advocacy group As You Sow.","This approach, however, does not always appease activists looking for bigger change. Olivia Knight, the group’s racial justice initiative coordinator, said companies often did not follow up with any action, and that many were limited to vague statements of support.","“I don’t think we can make the assumption the corporate world is a pot of social justice advocacy and should be looked to for guidance on these issues,” she said.","On Thursday, Reuters reported that Ford Motor Co’s political action committee is resuming making political donations. It said it will not rule out making donations to Republican lawmakers who voted against President Joe Biden’s election certification on Jan. 6. Former American Express Co CEO Ken Chenault, who co-authored a letter with other Black business leaders this week calling on companies to condemn the Georgia voting law, said in an interview that some firms may be hesitant to speak out for fear of appearing partisan.","But he noted that more than 60 big U.S. companies recently signed a statement opposing state bills focused on sexual orientation, showing a willingness to weigh in at least on some topics. In the battle on voting bills, “we are in the early stages,” Chenault said.","Speaking out against politically sensitive issues can be risky. Shares of some western apparel companies declined after they faced boycotts in China over their statements expressing concern about labor conditions, amid investor worries they would lose access to a vast, growing market. However, companies that spoke out against the Georgia voting law saw little impact on their share price.","Shivaram Rajgopal, a Columbia Business School professor who follows corporate cultural issues, said corporate America is focused on satisfying its skilled young workers, who are getting more politically active on social media.","“The younger workforce expects you to take a stand on these social justice issues,” Rajgopol said.","A 2019 study by the Pew Research Center found members of the U.S. generations known as Millennials, born between 1981 and 1996, and Gen Z, born after 1996, share more liberal attitudes than older generations on a range of issues, such as favoring more racial diversity and activist government.","“If we are not speaking up against these voter suppression efforts, we’re really taking a chunk out of ourselves and who we are as aviation,” said Sara Nelson, president of the Association of Flight Attendants, speaking at a U.S. aviation summit on Wednesday.","The views of global customers and investors also matter more to international conglomerates like Coke and Delta than local politics, said Ric Marshall, executive director at sustainability ratings firm MSCI.","“Management at these companies is much more beholden to this broader stakeholder group,” Marshall said. Conversely, companies that have said less about voting rights could be wary of alienating a more domestic customer base, he said."
