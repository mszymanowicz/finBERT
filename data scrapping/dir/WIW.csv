Ten-year yields rose 80 basis points in the first quarter, climbing above 1.77% before easing last week to around 1.5%.","But even after the sell-off, corporate debt yields remain near all-time lows, so borrowers are hurrying to refinance existing debt. With the Federal Reserve broadly expected to taper stimulus from 2022, borrowing costs could rise above 2% by year-end.","“Volatility and the sharp upward moves in yields served as a gentle reminder that low base rates weren’t necessarily going to be here forever. That motivated borrowers to start thinking about (refinancing) if they hadn’t already,” said Chris Munro, head of global leveraged finance at BofA in New York.","Even as Treasury markets were roiled during the first quarter, junk-rated firms raced to tap markets and raised a record $205 billion, according to Refinitiv.","In the U.S. junk bond market, the world’s biggest, 77% of the issuance was aimed at refinancing, compared with 66% in all 2020. At $122 billion, refinancing volumes were the highest ever, JP Morgan estimates.","Leveraged loans, also used by junk-rated companies, saw $301 billion raised in the United States for the second-highest quarter ever, according to JP Morgan.

Vast cash balances following last year’s funding spree could be the reason.","The incremental increase in Treasury yields is also less significant for investment-grade companies from a cost perspective, as their debt has an average maturity of over 10 years, said Shobhit Gupta, head of U.S. credit strategy at Barclays.","Longer maturities mean the amount of debt needing refinancing every year is low, so rising borrowing costs have less effect on those companies’ debt-servicing costs.","Even so, if issuers believe rates will keep going higher, some companies could “bring forward their supply and also perhaps change the nature of it a little bit, maybe issue longer-dated paper on the margin,” Gupta said."

Treasury said the expansion aims to provide providing additional liquidity to countries struggling with the coronavirus pandemic, helping to avoid debt problems.","U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen first backed the SDR allocation - previously opposed by the Trump administration - in late February. Last week, IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva said she would present the fund’s smaller executive board with a $650 billion SDR expansion proposal by June.","Some Republicans in Congress have criticized the move for providing reserves to rich countries that don’t need them, as well as to countries they view as U.S. adversaries, including China, Russia, Iran and Venezuela. They have also raised concerns about more U.S. borrowing needed for countries to convert their SDRs to hard currency.","The U.S. Treasury officials said that only about 2% of the last SDR allocation of about $250 billion in 2009 was exchanged for underlying currencies. SDRs are made up of dollars, euros, yen, sterling and yuan.","This time around, the percentage is likely to be higher, given countries’ continued spending needs to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, but still small. About 70% of the allocation will go to G20 countries, which have more resources and are seen as unlikely to cash in their SDRs, the officials said.","According to a Treasury fact sheet here, low-income countries would get $21 billion in SDR reserves, with about $212 billion going to other emerging market and developing countries excluding China.","“The United States retains the right to refuse to purchase SDRs from any country whose policies run counter to U.S. interests,” the Treasury fact sheet said. “Many large countries, such as most advanced economies and China, already hold excess SDRs and are very unlikely to request to exchange their new SDRs for hard currency.”","Dollars exchanged for SDRs would come from Treasury’s Exchange Stabilization Fund, but these would need to be replenished by issuing new Treasury debt. Yellen has said the net cost to taxpayers is “a wash” because interest collected on the SDR holdings would offset interest paid on the debt.","The Treasury officials said progress had been made on increasing transparency about the use of the SDRs, but said work was still continuing on ways for richer countries to loan their SDRs to countries that needed them.","The current system allows such donations only to the poorest countries, but U.N. officials and civil society groups are pushing to ensure access for heavily-indebted middle-income countries as well."

The administration says the plan will discourage the shifting of jobs overseas.,INTERNATIONAL TAX NEGOTIATIONS,"The Biden administration says it wants to end a global ""race to the bottom"" on corporate taxes. The U.S. Treasury is currently seeking a global agreement on international taxation of companies and digital commerce through the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) that would create a global minimum tax.

Biden is proposing a tax credit for U.S. firms that move jobs back to the United States.,INTANGIBLE INCOME LOOPHOLE,"The administration is proposing to eliminate tax breaks on foreign income derived from intangible assets such as software services, trademark royalties, intellectual property licenses on technology, pharmaceuticals and other products. These are generally taxed at a rate of around 13%, far less than the headline 21% rate.",LARGE CORPORATION MINIMUM TAX,"The plan would enact a 15% minimum tax on the ""book income"" that the largest corporations report to investors to ensure that they cannot use tax code loopholes to completely eliminate their tax liability. In presenting his plan, Biden singled out Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) for paying ""not a single penny"" in federal income taxes. read more",FOSSIL FUELS,Tax credits and deductions for fossil fuel producers would be eliminated under the plan as part of Biden's drive to cut taxes.,IRS ENFORCEMENT,"The administration would boost resources for the Internal Revenue Service to ensure that it can effectively enforce U.S. tax laws after years of cuts that has left it with 15,000 fewer revenue agents than a decade ago. The administration's plan says this is aimed at keeping corporations from evading taxes, but additional IRS funding also would likely be directed at wealthy individuals.

Stock markets, which for years surfed the cheap-money wave, tumbled.",The selloff was driven by concerns that adding enormous buckets of government spending to a fast-recovering U.S. economy would push inflation above the Federal Reserve’s target sooner than anticipated.,"In theory, that would force the Fed’s hand in raising interest rates, wiping out investors’ bond market returns.","In reality, a lasting inflation rise is likely years off -- Fed boss Jerome Powell reckons three years.

Another market revolt erupted in late 2018, egged on by then President Donald Trump. The Fed soon pivoted from raising rates to cutting them.",So markets have seen this movie before.,"But this time there is a plot twist: Central bank stimulus, aimed at lifting growth and inflation, has helped boost stock and bond prices, but now government spending on top of that could fuel price pressures - which hurt bonds and stocks.","Salman Ahmed, head of global macro at Fidelity International, expects another selloff when the $1.9 trillion stimulus starts to trickle through the U.S. economy.","Yields 25-40 bps above recent highs would worry the Fed, he believes, adding that words won’t placate markets next time.

Inflation fears helped to send yields on longer-dated Treasuries last week to one-year highs, while flooded money markets briefly sent a key overnight borrowing rate below zero.","On March 31, a regulatory break that big banks have enjoyed regarding SLR is scheduled to expire. Unless the Federal Reserve extends the break, banks will have to hold more capital against Treasury bonds, as well as deposits they keep at the Fed.","That could cut bank demand for government debt and reduce the funding for other investors to buy bonds, resulting in increased market volatility, which was a factor last March that prompted the Fed to offer banks SLR leniency.",Two prominent Democratic senators urged the Fed in a Feb. 26 letter to let the SLR break expire.,"The regulator will make a decision soon, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said last week.","Some market expectations that the exemption would be extended “started to price out last week when Powell was noncommittal on the topic,” said Dan Krieter, a director in fixed income strategy at BMO Capital Markets in Chicago, pointing to movements in interest rate swaps.","SLR is part of a broader set of capital rules that were reworked after the 2007-2009 financial crisis to dissuade excessive risk taking at big Wall Street banks. The industry considers deposits held at the Fed – also known as “reserves” – to be essentially risk-free, and bankers have long argued against including them in SLR calculations.","As of year-end, big banks, including JPMorgan Chase & Co, Bank of America Corp and Citigroup Inc were well above the SLR requirement to hold capital equal to at least 5% of total assets.","However, the calculation would almost certainly change if the Fed does not extend relief, because bank balance sheets have swollen with the trillions of dollars the Fed and Treasury Department injected into the financial system to offset effects of the pandemic.","Bank reserves have doubled to $3.4 trillion since the pandemic began, according to Fed data. Additional stimulus measures could add another $2 trillion, according to a Treasury committee report.","If the Fed does nothing, banks have a few options for compliance.","They can get rid of deposits, back away from Treasuries and overnight lending, pare corporate and mortgage loans, raise capital and reduce stock buybacks that the Fed recently allowed them to resume. Each option has pros and cons for market stability and profits.","For instance, JPMorgan might issue preferred securities to boost capital, Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Piepszak said in January. The cost of such securities could reduce earnings per share at big banks by a couple of percentage points, Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck said in a recent report.","Credit Suisse analyst Zoltan Pozsar recently summed up the situation in a report, saying: “The banking system is running out of balance sheet.

What matters for broader markets is QE and fiscal stimulus rather than growth in reserves.”",They argue the Fed can address falling T-bill yields or overnight interbank rates by hiking the IOER - the interest it pays banks for holding reserves above the required minimum.,"And if Congress does approve President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion spending plan, Treasury borrowing will rise again, easing the T-bill shortage."

For a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs/3aT8V0K",The SBV did not respond to requests for comment.,"There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by Vietnam. Many central banks intervene regularly in currency markets. Vietnam has consistently said its currency policies aimed to maintain stability and control inflation, not seek trade advantage.","“We do not have anything public to share at this time,” a Treasury official said in an emailed response to Reuters’ queries about Vietnam’s foreign exchange practices.","Vietnam, which has seen a surge in export-led growth as manufacturing of electronics and other goods, has increasingly shifted to the Southeast Asian nation, especially from China after its trade war with Washington.",A higher value of the dong because of its trade surplus could hurt this growth in the middle of a pandemic.,"Nguyen Xuan Binh, who is head of research at KB Securities in Hanoi and familiar with the trades but not directly involved with them, said the delayed delivery of dollars meant Vietnam’s central bank could avoid triggering one of the conditions behind the U.S. label: buying dollars in six of 12 consecutive months.","The Treasury’s semi-annual report to Congress, which examines exchange rate policies of major trading partners, said in December that Vietnam’s currency management was aimed at creating “unfair competitive advantage in international trade.”","It said Vietnam met all the conditions that trigger the currency manipulator designation, including “persistent, one-sided intervention” in the currency market.","The stakes are high for Vietnam since further interventions after the currency manipulator label could trigger a U.S. response, such as new tariffs on its goods. The next U.S. review is slated for April.","Under its January deals, the SBV offered the local banks an above-market rate of 23,125 dong per dollar, according to the three sources and written trading messages sent by the central bank. That rate is a premium of about 0.5% on current spot prices.","If the dong were to rise further between January and June, it would increase the premium over spot prices for the banks. And if the dong were to weaken below 23,125, they could then cancel the deal and sell dollars in the spot market instead.","Reuters could not determine the size of the SBV’s intervention, but the three traders said it was large enough to create demand for dollars in the market, which put downward pressure on the dong.","The currency’s value in the black market, where the dong is often traded in the real economy, has fallen 1.1% as the traders said dollar supply may have dried up.","SBV’s new transactions resemble financial derivatives known as forwards, which bind parties to exchange currencies at a future date at an agreed upon rate, the three sources said.","Forwards contracts offer several advantages to central banks. They do not require cash up-front and can help smooth out sudden shifts in reserves. Indeed, they are popular with other Asian central banks, such as those in India, Taiwan and South Korea.","But four of the people familiar with the transactions said SBV’s agreements were not typical forward contracts, as they gave banks the option to cancel the deal without significant costs.","Two of them said the SBV had offered similar options previously, around 2015, although then it had been selling dollar forwards in order to try and support a sliding value of the dong.","As the SBV previously preferred to use three-month forward contracts, all six sources familiar with the transactions said the shift to a longer time frame suggested a desire to buy time before the intervention drew U.S. attention or pressure.",The SBV did not respond to questions about its approach.

In an ethics agreement here, she pledged not to involve herself in specific matters involving the firm - as well as major banks including Citigroup, Barclays and Goldman Sachs - without first seeking authorization.","Treasury ethics attorneys have given Yellen flexibility to work on any related markets or broad financial services sector issues, with no limits on current or future matters, the Treasury official said. She may need to seek further authorization to deal with specific firms she listed.","In the memo granting Yellen permission to call the meeting of regulators, a Treasury ethics official, Brian Sonfield, said it would be “difficult, if not impossible” for Yellen to recuse herself from matters involving market volatility.","“You are the Secretary of the Treasury, the duties of which require you to be involved in a broad array of matters focused on these sectors,” Sonfield wrote.","“Issues relating to these sectors could arise at any time without the opportunity for consultation with the ethics office,” and “argue in favor of prior authorization.”"

His appointment comes as the world's top economies are struggling to manage the coronavirus pandemic and ensure a nascent global recovery stays on course.",The White House and Treasury had no comment. Lipton did not respond to an emailed request for comment.,"Bringing Lipton on board to guide international matters will free Yellen to focus on the U.S. economy and work to ensure passage of President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion economic rescue plan, the sources said.

He had served nearly 8-1/2 years in the role.","Widely respected in economic circles, Lipton, 67, was often critical of former President Donald Trump's trade policies and tariff actions, which triggered heavy costs for U.S. companies and farmers and spawned significant tensions with allies.","Lipton began his professional career as an economist at the IMF in 1981, and in addition to his role in the Clinton administration, he held a senior role in the administration of former President Barack Obama.","Allies are looking for more muscular U.S. leadership on global issues ranging from climate change, battling the pandemic and staving off a wave of sovereign debt defaults among low-income countries.

Citadel Securities, a separate trading arm, pays Robinhood to execute its users’ trades, a practice that has drawn some concern from investor advocates.","The White House has said Yellen is among a handful of officials monitoring the fracas. As head of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), Yellen is broadly responsible for the health of the entire trading and investing system.","A sticking point for her to clear, though, may be $700,000 in speaking fees she accepted from Citadel, as recently as last fall. Yellen has pledged not to involve herself in an official capacity in matters involving the firm without first seeking a written waiver from Treasury ethics officials.","Ethics experts say that pledge is not a hard wall for her to scale should the need arise. After ethics violations dogged the Trump administration, some groups are urging Yellen to pre-emptively seek a waiver, and set a precedent.","“This example is a good test of Biden’s ethics executive order and the transparency that follows, but it also highlights the revolving door and why restrictions are necessary to protect the integrity of government missions, policies, and programs,” said Scott Amey, general counsel at Project On Government Oversight, a nonpartisan government watchdog group.","The Treasury secretary normally does not get involved in matters involving individual stocks and concentrates instead on broad systemic risks to the financial system, which the department monitors through daily market surveillance.","“Secretary Yellen of course will abide by her ethics agreement and ethics pledge in all instances,” Treasury spokesman Calvin Mitchell said. He did not indicate how she would approach the specific Citadel issue.","Like many former government officials, including here her Federal Reserve chair predecessor Ben Bernanke, Yellen took speaking fees from private companies after she left government.","Yellen filed an ethics agreement here with the Office of Government Ethics in December saying she would ""seek written authorization to participate personally and substantially in any particular matter"" related to any companies that paid her speaking fees prior to joining President Joe Biden's administration - for a year after her last speech to each firm.","Yellen spoke several times at Citadel, most recently on an Oct. 27 webinar, according to the filing. She was paid at least $700,000 in speaking fees by the Citadel while she was in private practice at the Brookings Institution think tank, another disclosure here shows.","These speaking engagements, which also include financial heavyweights such as Barclays, Citigroup, and Goldman Sachs, are not likely to impact her ability to give Biden broad advice on the stock trading matter, government ethics experts say.","“If this becomes a situation where regulators are considering new rulemaking with Citadel as the poster-child, that’s different,” said Lisa Gilbert, executive vice president of Public Citizen, a group pushing for stronger financial regulation.",A major question is whether volatility from Gamestop and similar retail investor revolts against short-squeezes boil over into a systemic event that sends markets crashing broadly.,"Typically a matter involving an individual stock or equity market trading and brokerages would fall to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has said it is examining the matter.","On Friday, SEC commissioners including acting chair Allison Herren Lee said in a statement here they were closely monitoring the extreme volatility in certain stocks and warned market participants to ""uphold their obligations to protect investors and to identify and pursue potential wrongdoing.""","Extreme stock price volatility “has the potential to expose investors to rapid and severe losses and undermine market confidence,” they added.","Biden’s choice to run the SEC, Gary Gensler, awaits Senate hearings.",The FSOC that Yellen chairs is charged with identifying risks and responding to emerging threats to financial stability. It includes the heads of the Federal Reserve and other major U.S. financial regulatory agencies.,It has the authority to designate non-bank financial institutions for consolidated supervision to minimize risk to the financial system or to break up firms that pose a “grave threat.”,"Distress in individual companies rarely rises to such a level. Treasury maintains daily market surveillance, but it is looking for orderly market functioning and broad systemic threats.","Thus far, the situation looks contained, Barclays said in a note to clients on Friday. Short positions in stocks favored on the Reddit social media site total about $40 billion, which would limit the pain to a handful of hedge funds.","“The ongoing short squeeze in a few stocks by retail investors has raised concerns of a broader contagion. While we believe there is more pain to come, we remain optimistic that it is likely to remain localized,” Barclays said.","Unlike many previous Treasury secretaries, Yellen has only worked as an academic and for the government, not at a bank or trading firm.","Richard Painter, a former top ethics lawyer to President George W. Bush, said many Treasury secretaries had a great deal more entanglements that would raise conflict of interest concerns than Yellen.","Henry Paulson, a Republican who was U.S. Treasury secretary during the 2008 financial meltdown, sold half a billion dollars in stock from his former employer Goldman Sachs Group Inc to satisfy ethics concerns. Paulson later forced Goldman and other major banks to take billions of dollars in taxpayer capital at the depth of the financial crisis.","Steven Mnuchin, Yellen's immediate predecessor, pledged here after he was nominated to divest $94 million in investments, and refrain from any decisions involving CIT Group until August 2018, when he was due a payment of $5 million from the company.","“Yellen is going to be about as clean as you can get on this stuff,” Painter said.",(This story refiles to add in paragraph 3 full company name for Citadel entity that executes Robinhood trades)

It puts debt repayments due this year at 16 billion dinars, up from 11 billion dinars in 2020.","Kooli said Tunisia wants a new $1 billion loan guarantee arrangement from the United States, which he said could help it secure the $3 billion in bond issuance, the first time he has given that figure.","The government also hopes to reach agreement with the International Monetary Fund on a new financing programme, and he said recent Article IV consultations were a step towards that.","However, Kooli said Tunisia had not yet decided how much new international debt to seek and that it was taking steps to improve its credit rating and gain IMF blessing for the move.","“I believe there is a real possibility to go to the markets for at least $1 billion during 2021,” he said, adding that the higher sum of $3 billion would also be possible.","Tunisia is looking at various instruments including a sukuk for the first time, a club deal, a specific action for the Asian market or a dollar-denominated bond issue, Kooli said, without elaborating.","The government may also issue, separately, a sukuk for the domestic market before July, he said, adding that it could be in the region of around 300 million dinars.","Tunisia will switch to targeted subsidies in coming months, he said, and will announce restructuring plans for state-owned companies after Ramadan, which this year ends in mid-May.","However, the pandemic may delay some reforms both to avoid increasing the economic pain for ordinary Tunisians and because it is not a good time to attract potential investment in state companies.","Targeted subsidies will involve distributing digital cards for lower-income Tunisians as well as other measures, he said.","However, the government is still assessing how many people require help, what price different products should be and how to avoid a big rise in inflation, he said.","Although Prime Minister Hichem Mechichi has already announced a new unit to take over state-owned companies from direct control by government ministries, the details of reforms will not be announced until they are finalised, Kooli said.","He confirmed the government would sell its share in some firms but did not identify them. He questioned whether the state needed to hold minority shares in companies, whether it needed to own stock in 12 banks, as now, or in gambling.","Any revenues raised by privatisation would be pumped back into other state-owned companies that the government wants to restructure, he said.","Tunisia’s main labour union, the UGTT, has previously resisted any privatisation, but Kooli said he expected no trouble there, adding the government was “not looking for a fight”.","On the public sector wage bill, Kooli said the government was looking at different ways to reduce it, for example by offering slightly lower pay for greatly reduced hours.","“The possibility to work half time and be paid a little bit more than half salary is an avenue we are considering,” he said.",($1 = 2.7014 Tunisian dinars)

Anything that benefits from rising prices is going to do well.,"“The market had a one-way bet that the Republicans were going to win both seats in the Georgia runoff...but as we found out that didn’t happen, and that changes a lot.","“The reason why there’s a reflation trade is when you look at the policy settings they are trying to get through, it’s about printing to the Main Street and not Wall Street.","“Taxes and regulations will go up, but they will be printing a lot more money and giving a lot more support for consumer spending, so it favours the domestic economy over support for corporate profits.","“A huge amount of money has come out of the bond market. Even though only a portion of that went into equities, it’s jammed up equities. When passive money moves around this is what happens.”","AKIRA TAKEI, GLOBAL FIXED INCOME FUND MANAGER, ASSET MANAGEMENT ONE, TOKYO","“The rise in yields and stocks can be explained by the Blue Wave and expectations that Biden’s win will lead to massive fiscal stimulus, but I think fiscal stimulus is an old story.",“The events in Washington show that the United States is divided and we have to question whether the people will be united once again. It looks like maybe not.,“This is bad for equities and the dollar. The equities rally is already over-extended and looks like a bubble. I can’t see Treasury yields rising much further from here. It looks like a good level to buy Treasuries.”,"JASON TEH, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, VERTIUM ASSET MANAGEMENT, SYDNEY","“Commodities are up and banks are up. The catalyst for that is really the Democrat win of the Senate, and in fact you can see it in the intra-market movements.",“Tech came off and anything considered value - or really ‘old-economy’ stocks - moved up.,“Biden now has a greater pathway to approve his laws.,"“There’s only one way a riot can de-rail the stock market and that’s if it spills over into the economy. If a riot results in a lockdown, like what you would expect with a COVID lockdown, then you could potentially see stock market ramifications - but these feel more like skirmishes rather than a wide lockdown.”","MASAFUMI YAMAMOTO, CHIEF CURRENCY STRATEGIST, MIZUHO SECURITIES, TOKYO","“The mob has interrupted to the process of Biden’s confirmation, but the mob will not overturn the process because Republicans are saying no to that.",“The market is optimistic that Biden’s victory will not be overturned.,"“Realisation of the Democratic sweep will be positive for the U.S. economy, U.S. stocks, and the dollar.","“Higher Treasury yields should benefit the dollar against the euro and the yen, because the dollar has underpriced the potential for U.S economic recovery under Biden.","“However, the dollar will remain weaker against commodity currencies like the Aussie and emerging market currencies.",“Markets are trying to position for a U.S. economic recovery. This is easy to do in Treasuries and stocks.”,"TIM CHUBB, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, GIRARD, WEST CHESTER, PENNSYLVANIA","“What give us a little bit of a pause is that the economy is still very fragile and I think it’s unlikely that Democrats are going to have as easy of a time as markets are trying to predict in passing some of these policies. Especially when it comes to tax reform, I think the window is relatively small. It’s going to be difficult to achieve that level of tax reform and some of these restrictive policies as cooler heads prevail and the Democratic process works itself out.”","“What market is really (keen on) is more stimulus. We’ve seen over the course of 2020 Democratic party be much more open to providing stimulus to vulnerable Americans. That, along with additional support for greater fiscal policy as we climb out of COVID-19 downdraft in the economy and hopes for an infrastructure bill.”","GUY LEBAS, CHIEF FIXED INCOME STRATEGIST, JANNEY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, PHILADELPHIA","“The Georgia senatorial elections tipped in favor of the two Democratic candidates, which gives Democrats, with Vice President Harris’ vote, a narrow majority in the Senate and that increases the odds of greater fiscal stimulus and a proposed infrastructure spending package.”","“With those programs two things happen. One, there’s a chance that greater fiscal spending generates inflation. Two, there’s a high probability of greater long-duration Treasury supply. The usual supply-demand dynamics in the market mean that greater supply will push yields a little bit higher.”","KEN POLCARI, MANAGING PARTNER, KACE CAPITAL ADVISORS, JUPITER, FLORIDA","“It’s a re-positioning. I’ve been saying this for a couple of weeks, if there was a Democratic sweep the market has to reprice a little bit. It doesn’t mean it has to fall out of bed. A five percent or seven percent move lower is well within the normal trading band and wouldn’t be out of the question at all before the market finds stability. The market will figure it out but the path of least resistance is right now is lower before it goes higher. Five to seven percent is well within normal and actually it is probably very healthy if it does that anyway.”","SEBASTIEN GALY, SENIOR MACRO STRATEGIST, NORDEA ASSET MANAGEMENT, LUXEMBOURG","“We are trading as if Democrats have won both of the races, which mean more fiscal deficits and a steeper Treasury curve and there we enter into the psychological level of 1% in the 10-year treasury yield and that seems to have caused a significant move in growth (stocks).",“Growth of course depends on the expectations that rates stay very low so the two are related phenomenally. It’s interesting because it shows that everybody expects that eventually we get a tapering and we get higher yields and of course growth is going to tank and value is going to outperform. We are seeing a preview of it right now. That’s the surprising message of the market.”,“If Democrats hold both houses then there will be more pressure to regulate some of the bigger play within growth. Most of the (market) gains are concentrated in them and hence they are very sensitive to this.”,"JIM VOGEL, INTEREST RATE STRATEGIST, FHN FINANCIAL, MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE","“There were a lot of people lined up to buy (Treasuries) if there was a blue wave election in November, and they got disappointed and instead it was the sellers at the long-end emphasizing TIPS purchases and all sorts of inflation-protection strategies that carried the day. Now you’re going to be dealing far more with fundamentals, and what’s the ‘real economy’ going to look like when we end 2021, as opposed to what might happen. All the things that fell into a ‘what if this happens,’ such as senate control changing, are now here and so we can start to deal with what’s here.”","“I think the big thing is you could see easily another half a trillion in terms of direct aid to states. That idea has never died. I don’t know what the exact amount would be but it’s something on that order, which is real, versus where we were before the Georgia runoffs. But it’s not so big that it changes everything.”","OLIVIER KONZEOUE, FX SALES TRADER, SAXO MARKETS, LONDON (email)","“This means markets will anticipate more fiscal stimulus which could prop up inflation and mechanically push US interest rates higher but this also increases the prospect of more regulation imposed on technology companies as well as corporate tax hikes.“This could naturally drive interest rates-sensitive growth stocks lower, typically technology stocks, as NASDAQ Futures illustrate by extending losses to 2% this morning.“With 10-Year Treasury yields above 1% on expectations of a Democratic Senate and the Fed committed to support the market, the US Dollar would be expected to further tilt lower versus its main peers.”","DAVID BAHNSEN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, THE BAHNSEN GROUP, NEWPORT BEACH, CALIFORNIA (emailed)","“I don’t expect major stock market implications surrounding a 50-50 tie in the Senate. While the Vice President’s vote means that a straight party line vote would belong to the Democrats, some of the market unfriendly policies that investors have been worried about in the event of a Blue Wave are still not going to come so easily. There are now three moderate Democrat Senators (most notably Joe Manchin of West Virginia) and House Democrats maintain a small lead.”","“The Democrats’ small lead in both the Senate and the House will make it tougher than many believe to pass tax hikes, impose regulation and enact some of the other market unfriendly policies that investors have been worried about under a Blue Wave scenario.”","“Investors should not be making any portfolio reallocations based off of the Georgia Senate results. If an investor’s asset allocation was to be substantially altered by a 50-50 Senate vs. a 51-49 Senate split, that asset allocation was never constructed well from the outset.”","PETER CARDILLO, CHIEF MARKET ECONOMIST, SPARTAN CAPITAL SECURITIES, NEW YORK","“It’s even if the Republicans should hold on to the Senate, it’s by a very slim margin. That means the Democrats can say it’s a victory. That means they have a better chance of passing legislation since they can always capture an independent or a more progressive Republican.","“In the short term, it could be a catalyst to correct. The market is overbought and is looking for a catalyst to correct. And today’s election results is the perfect catalyst for the market to pull back. That doesn’t mean it’s going to happen immediately.","“If you look what’s happening this morning financials, energy, sectors related to infrastructure are strong, and tech stocks are getting badly beaten. What is that suggesting? Taxes will probably go up and certain sectors of the market could get hit. What we’re seeing this morning is somewhat of a snapshot of what may be in store 3 to 6 months down the road.”","GUY LEBAS, CHIEF FIXED INCOME STRATEGIST, JANNEY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, PHILADELPHIA","“The Georgia senatorial elections tipped in favor of the two Democratic candidates, which gives Democrats, with Vice President Harris’ vote, a narrow majority in the Senate and that increases the odds of greater fiscal stimulus and a proposed infrastructure spending package.”","“With those programs two things happen.

Biden is expected to nominate former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen as U.S. Treasury secretary.,"“If Janet Yellen is the next Secretary of the Treasury, she loves to print and spend money,” Rogers said.","Taking a contrarian view, Rogers said he was not bearish on the U.S. dollar after its correction and on its safe haven appeal.","“There are many bears right now, which usually leads to a rally; so, I’m not bearish on the U.S. dollar,” he said.","Bets against the U.S. dollar were expected to linger or even increase in the aftermath of the Nov. 3 presidential election, a Reuters poll found.","Rogers said he was not buying gold or silver at current prices, but was looking at declines in both precious metals to add to his portfolio. He was one of the earliest investors to predict the boom in commodities in the early-2000s.","“Silver is much cheaper than gold on a historical basis. I will buy both (silver and gold), but I will buy more silver.”","For other news from Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit 2021, click here",Follow Reuters Summits on Twitter @Reuters_Summits,"(This interview was conducted in the Reuters Global Markets Forum, a chat room hosted on the Refinitiv Messenger platform.

But it’s still some 20% above its mean since 2005 - a period that takes in whirlwinds surrounding this pandemic and the Great Financial Crisis of 2007/08.","The U.S. Treasury bond market’s equivalent index, the MOVE, is by contrast now almost 50% below its mean over the same 15-year period.","The Federal Reserve’s expected suppression of borrowing rates close to likely floor near zero largely explains the bond side of that picture, with post-election government gridlock expected to rein in more extreme fiscal spending speculation.","That said, the confidence is impressive given the Federal Reserve has so far eschewed any formal government yield cap and has stopped short to date of extending the maturity of its bond buying programmes to longer-dated issues.","But if bond markets’ assumption of subdued Treasury volatility going forward proves true, then implied equity caution is even more puzzling - not least given the outsize forecasts being clocked for the S&P500 over the coming year.",Both banking giants JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs now forecast the S&P500 to gain a further 25% at least over the next two years - with JPM seeing that possible by the end of this year.,"While a gain of 25% would still be less that 2019’s full-year surge, there have only been 10 other years since 1970 that have managed gains of more than 25%. And next year it will most likely be starting close to record highs.",“AWFULLY MISPRICED”,Citi analysts describe the behaviour of equity and bond market volatility as an “interesting medium-term dynamic” that should rectify gradually as the recovery kicks in next year.,"“We view next year as being a positive backdrop for equities with potential for further curve steepening,” they wrote. “Historically, such an environment sees fixed income volatility rise while equity volatility is flat or falls.”",Morgan Stanley concurs on the Treasury side at least and their rationale perhaps squares the circle to some degree.,"Forecasting a boom in nominal U.S. gross domestic product growth next year of 7.5% as vaccines kick in, they claim that 10-year Treasury yield of 1% for next 12 months looks “awfully mispriced”.","What’s more, even many of the economists who do expect the Fed to conduct either an explicit or implicit yield cap policy don’t expect it to draw the line until 10-year rates hit 1.50% at least - almost twice where they are at the moment.",Morgan Stanley reckons this bond risk has significant implications for the valuation of “long duration” sectors such as technology stocks so beloved during the pandemic lockdowns. And this is hurrying the sharp rotation we’ve seen this month out of these stocks and into cyclicals and small cap firms.,"As vaccine breakthroughs hit the headlines this month, the Russell 2000 capturing the wider universe of smaller U.S. equities has gained almost 20% - twice the rise in the S&P500, far ahead of the 8% gain in the Nasdaq100 and almost four times the narrow grouping of tech leaders of the FANG+TM index.","“The real opportunity next year for investors is likely to take place below the surface in smaller-cap stocks that have greater sensitivity to what is likely to be a very strong economic recovery,” Morgan Stanley conclude.","While the overall equity bull market can continue, it can also contain some violent switches that can make for quite volatile gains. What’s more, expected vaccine rollouts early next year will take time and, until then, there’s still a pandemic, periodic lockdowns and economic damage to negotiate.","That’s also true for bonds and may be keeping some investors in those bunkers for longer, while the assumption of Fed policy support has rarely been disappointed in the past.","But the historically skewed pricing of risk may have to shift once a truer, post-pandemic rebound finally gets underway.",-- The author is editor-at-large for finance and markets at Reuters News.

Mnuchin extended some of the programs, including those supporting money market funds and the market for commercial paper, for an additional 90 days beyond year-end.","While some of the programs were lightly used, Fed officials said having them open as a backstop helped to stabilize markets during the pandemic.","Here’s a look at where the various programs stand, how much they were used, and when they expire. EXPIRING DEC. 31:","** MAIN STREET LENDING FACILITY Loans extended through Nov. 18: $5.4 billion The Fed has made several changes to the $600 billion Main Street program, including as recently as last month, in an effort to boost participation. The Fed opened the program to nonprofit groups and reduced the minimum loan amount to $100,000. But use of the program remained tepid. ** MUNICIPAL LIQUIDITY FACILITY Loans extended through Nov. 18: $1.7 billion The Municipal Liquidity Facility made up to $500 billion available for state and local governments, but it was only tapped by two borrowers - Illinois and New York’s cash-strapped Metropolitan Transportation Authority.","** TERM ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES LOAN FACILITY Loans extended through Nov. 18: $3.8 billion The TALF program purchased bundles of assets secured by auto loans, credit cards, student loans, loans backed by the Small Business Administration and other types of credit. Its aim is to make sure banks and other lenders such as auto finance companies have the cash to keep making loans to consumers and businesses. ** PRIMARY MARKET CORPORATE CREDIT FACILITY Loans extended through Nov. 18: $0 This program is meant to serve as a backstop for corporate debt, with the Fed offering to buy bonds and issue loans to companies. But issuers never tapped the facility for support. ** SECONDARY MARKET CORPORATE CREDIT FACILITY Loans extended through Nov. 18: $13.5 billion The Fed used this program to boost liquidity in the corporate credit market, at first by purchasing exchange-traded funds that invest in corporate bonds. The central bank then pivoted to purchasing individual corporate credit bonds in the secondary market, using an indexing approach to create broad market exposure. EXTENDED FOR 90 DAYS AFTER DEC. 31:","** COMMERCIAL PAPER FUNDING FACILITY Loans extended through Nov. 18: $0 The Fed reintroduced the CPFF, a tool it used during the last financial crisis, to get money directly into the hands of large businesses, which are major employers. The market for commercial paper, an essential source of short-term funding for many companies, had come under strain amid worries that companies affected by the pandemic would not be able to repay their IOUs. ** PRIMARY DEALER CREDIT FACILITY Loans extended through Nov. 18: $255 million Through this facility, the Fed offers short-term loans to the two dozen Wall Street firms authorized to transact directly with the central bank. The program offers funding of up to 90 days to primary dealers. A similar program run from 2008 to 2010 only offered overnight loans. ** MONEY MARKET MUTUAL FUND LIQUIDITY FACILITY Loans extended through Nov. 18: $5.2 billion This facility was established to keep the money market mutual fund industry functioning at a time when investors were withdrawing money at a fast clip. The tool offers loans of up to one year to financial institutions that pledge as collateral high-quality assets like U.S. Treasury bonds that they have purchased from money market mutual funds."
