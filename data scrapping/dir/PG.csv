Online retailers have scrambled to expand capacity as more people buy goods online, while food and other types of factories have seen automation as a tool to keep lines running and workers safely separated.","Shipments of robots rose to 31,044 in 2020, a 3.5% increase over the prior year, with 52% going to plants that make things such as consumer goods and pharmaceuticals, according to data compiled by industry group the Association for Advancing Automation.",The orders were valued at $1.57 billion in total.,"Orders by life sciences, pharmaceutical and biomedical companies rose 69% last year, the group reported, while demand from food and consumer goods companies grew by 56%.","“There’s definitely been an upturn in particular areas because of the pandemic,” said Alex Shikany, the group’s vice president of membership and business intelligence. “The value proposition of automation is always efficiency, but with a pandemic it’s also a way to space workers out and to run factories 24 hours a day without disruptions.”","The robot industry, like most manufacturers, was hit hard during the pandemic as global supply chains ground to a halt and businesses closed. But business snapped back later in the year. Robot shipments in the fourth quarter were the second highest in history, up nearly 64% from the year-ago period, the report said.","The auto industry, a mix of assembly plants and parts suppliers, has long dominated the market for robots, although the level of demand can fluctuate depending on how many automakers are retooling for new models. Automotive accounted for two-thirds of robot shipments in 2017.",Procter & Gamble Co. is among the non-automotive companies using more automation in its factories and warehouses.,"Mark Lewandowski, the company’s director of robotics innovation, said that a decade ago, there was less machinery specifically designed for factories that made things like food or soap.","“Automotive was the big gorilla in the room,” he said, but that’s changed. Over the past year, for instance, P&G was able to move quickly in response to the pandemic to install more robots in facilities that bundle together goods into special packaging.","“Traditionally that was done manually,” he said, because the machines that could have automated it were expensive and lacked the flexibility needed to constantly switch between packaging different combinations of goods. But with new urgency to separate workers to keep them safe and the availability to cheaper and more flexible machines, it was doable, he said."

Procter & Gamble, which has already teamed up with Dunkin’ Brands to promote the use of its cleaning products in restaurants, is looking for more partners -- and it’s hoping for a payoff in the grocery store aisle.","Procter & Gamble PG.N is chasing deals with fast-food, hospitality, transportation and healthcare companies to stick P&G branding for products like Dawn dish soap and Spic and Span counter scrubs prominently on walls and windows  to help lure back customers who began to shy away from places like restaurants and hotels in March as fears of the coronavirus took hold, the company told Reuters.",P&G  in July  struck agreements with several  existing restaurant partners - including Dunkin' Brands' DNKN.O donut shops and Denny's DENN.O coffee shops - to tout their use of Dawn and Spic and Span counter scrubs.,"It’s a “halo effect,” Paul Edmondson, the head of P&G Professional North America, said of the promotion’s marketing advantage.  ”It’s the  same consumer  that’s shopping in stores that’s eating out at one of the restaurants.”","P&G, one of the top  advertising  spenders in the United States,  is racing against  Clorox CLX.N and Lysol maker Reckitt Benckiser RB.L to  plug home cleaning brands at  restaurants  and  other businesses.","“The reason why P&G wants to do this is because...it can produce free publicity,” said Kimberly Whitler, an associate professor of business at University of Virginia Darden School of Business and a former P&G marketing executive. “It’s a new outlet where consumers are not necessarily thinking about P&G products, and suddenly they’re seeing them there.”","Promoting household products such as  Spic and Span, Dawn and Microban 24  sanitizer at  major restaurant chains  can serve as a  cheap form of marketing  for P&G, said Lisa Kane,  group director for strategy at branding firm  Siegel+Gale.","“It gives them more control, and they can choose who they partner with and allow this co-branding with,” Kane said. P&G’s clients may tout their locations as deep-cleaned and disinfected frequently, although the promotion doesn’t require an inspection or any independent verification by P&G that the locations are  actually clean.","Disinfectants kill whatever is on a surface, but not long term - these businesses would have to spray things down over and over again if people are constantly sitting on chairs or using bathrooms, regulatory consultant Kevin Kutcel said. “Legally, ‘deep-cleaning’ doesn’t mean anything,” he added.","In May, Reckitt Benckiser signed  a deal with  Hilton Hotels HLT.N,  which put up signs and labels in hotel lobbies saying its bed sheets and common spaces are cleaned using Lysol or Dettol products. Rival Clorox Co CLX.N recently  began  working in some cities with  ride-sharing company Uber RIC, whose users now get a notification with each booking confirmation that their driver has Clorox wipes available - with the Clorox logo prominently displayed.","“We believe that advertising is our way to play offense, gain market share and benefit disproportionately for years to come,”  Clorox’s chief executive, Benno Dorer, told Reuters in an interview. “We can grow market share when others do the opposite.”","Clorox, which plans to spend an amount representing about 11% of sales on advertising  during this fiscal full year, said it is in talks with “a lot more companies” for corporate deals, but declined to name any in the works.","“There’s enough research suggesting that during a recession, market share gains are much stickier and have a much more profound long-term effect,” Dorer  said.","P&G says marketing its products is not the main goal of its deals, and it is not forcing any restaurants to use stickers that specifically cite P&G brands.","To lure customers who may be nervous about dining out, some restaurant chains have begun putting signs in visible locations stating that they are  participating in safety “seal of approval” programs run by the National Restaurant Association and other groups.","Nearly all  advertisers  have confronted a chaotic marketing landscape on TV and social media this year, reworking ads to be sensitive to national reckonings over the health crisis as well as racism.","P&G has spent more than $65 million to  advertise  Mr. Clean on TV so far this year, and more than $36 million on commercials for  its home cleaner  Microban, according to data from TV ad tracking firm  iSpot."

The company had offered refills at its stores in the early 1990s, but discontinued them in 2003, citing a lack of consumer demand.","Unilever, which has set targets for reducing and recycling plastic by 2025, in October announced the planned launch of “refill sticks” of deodorants under its Dove line of personal care products on Loopstore.com. The website, operated by recycling company TerraCycle, offers consumers the chance to buy some household products in ultra-durable packaging with refills delivered to their doors, milkman-style.","Across the consumer goods industry, results for refillable products have been mixed so far as many shoppers are far too set in their ways to be easily weaned from living in a throwaway culture. While refills are less expensive to purchase - generally priced at 20% to 30% less per item than the containers they are aimed to replenish, according to Unilever - shoppers have so far, for the most part, failed to snap them up, the companies said.","SC Johnson & Son Inc, marketer of Windex and Pledge, said refills and concentrates so far have not played well with either Americans or Europeans over the decade they have been offered, with unit sales of such products pretty much flat. It pulled concentrated refills for Shout stain remover off the shelves because they were not selling very well.","In 2010, Unilever put 20-liter tanks to dispense detergents in Walmart Inc's WMT.N British supermarket chain Asda, and provided flexible pouches for customers to refill. But with leaky machines, safety and maintenance problems and the high costs of upkeep, Unilever said the tests fell short of expectations. Asda was also unhappy because the tanks occupied a lot of space.","“None of them sell very well – it is a convenience issue,” SC Johnson CEO Fisk Johnson told Reuters. Johnson said some people find it painstaking to wash and refill bottles themselves while others worry that smaller bottles filled with concentrates are less “bang-for-your-buck” than the larger ones they have used for years.","Still, the privately held company said it was expanding its refill offerings this year to address concerns surrounding plastic waste and is also testing refill stations for cleaning products with UK retailer Waitrose, owned by Britain’s John Lewis [JLPLC.UL]. The Waitrose tests are showing the first signs of progress in refill sales, Johnson said, and the company is now thinking of expanding the project.","Even if consumers are comfortable using refills for some household goods, it is more complicated to sell them for products like Pantene shampoo and Olay creams, P&G spokesman Jones said. For instance, with beauty products, the look and feel of packaging is a big factor in creating and maintaining customer loyalty, while delivering an environmental benefit, he said.","Some shoppers say they want to buy refillable products, but that the offerings are not available at many stores. Earlier this year, dozens of consumers took to social media to urge The Body Shop to bring back its refill counters.","“Refill, refill, refill!” Twitter user @JaiChipperfield said on July 22, joining a thread in which several other shoppers demanded the return of refills. “Seems to me that judging by these comments your customers want to see the return of refills,” @JaiChipperfield added. “Me too, it would be brilliant to see that return.”",The Body Shop eventually responded to those pleas.,"“Now with the renewed focus on sustainability, we believe it is the right time to return with it,” Body Shop spokeswoman Lucy Muircroft told Reuters this week."

We have an attitude at Trian, we steal any good idea. We’d rather be rich than right.”",The partnership is clearly paying off for all shareholders as P&G’s share price has surged 50% since before Peltz joined the board and has gained 32% in 2019 alone.,"“I don’t have to be right. I have to get the right thing done,” Taylor said.","Peltz joked that he had promised to shave his beard when P&G hit a price of $120 per share and he made good on that Wednesday when he cut it off, with P&G razors, of course.","As the men bantered, their once bitter fight brought home some parallels to a contest taking shape between AT&T T.N and Elliott Management.","Investors in the audience, including powerful pension funds from Massachusetts and Florida, got a glimpse at how activists and companies can work together, as AT&T undertakes a review of suggestions for a corporate overhaul from Elliott.","Elliott has urged AT&T to divest some units, save $5 billion in costs, stop acquiring more companies and review its leadership.

For the same period last year, P&G’s net income was $1.89 billion, or 72 cents per share.","Cincinnati-based P&G, which operates in 80 countries, sells Gillette razors, gels and foams worldwide and said the writedown was due primarily to currency fluctuations - enduring strength in the U.S. economy in recent years has strengthened the dollar. The charge was also driven by more competition over the past three years and a shrinking market for blades and razors as consumers in developed markets shave less frequently. Net sales in the grooming business, which includes Gillette, have declined in 11 out of the last 12 quarters.","“Initial carrying values for Gillette were established nearly 14 years ago in 2005. ... New competitors have entered at prices below the category average,” Chief Financial Officer Jon Moeller said on a call.","P&G paid $57 billion in 2005 for Gillette, the world’s No.1 shaving brand that is more than a century old. But in the 2010s technology altered the way consumers purchased razors, and relaxed social norms prompted men to shave less often, according to a Euromonitor report. In the past 5 years, the U.S. men’s market for shaving products has shrunk by over 11%, the data firm said.","For a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs/2LOT0X1.","P&G has been cutting prices and investing in new products at its grooming business, hoping to claw back market share from upstart shaving brands bought by rivals, such as Unilever's ULVR.L Dollar Shave Club and Edgewell Personal Care's EPC.N recent acquisition of Harry's.","For instance, P&G recently launched a razor called SkinGuard, designed for men with sensitive skin prone to irritation. Gillette’s share of the U.S. men’s razors and blades market slipped in 2018 while that of Harry’s and Unilever grew, Euromonitor data showed.","P&G has signaled to analysts for some time that it might write down Gillette, given the market’s issues; the charge is just an accounting expression of what we knew was happening to the business, Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj said.","Excluding items, the company earned $1.10 per share, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.05 as strong demand for SK-II and Olay beauty products drove P&G’s organic sales up 7%. Price hikes contributed 3 percentage points to organic sales growth, a closely watched metric which excludes items like acquisitions, divestitures and currency effects. Organic sales for all 10 of P&G’s global categories grew.","Shares rose nearly 5% to a record high of $121.76, before paring gains to 4.2% at midday.","P&G, like other consumer goods companies, has been raising prices on many of its products to tackle soaring freight and raw material costs that have dented margins. Organic sales in P&G’s beauty business rose 8%, boosted by demand for its super-premium SK-II brand and Olay skin care products. In the fabric and home care unit, the company’s biggest business which sells Tide detergent and Febreze air fresheners, organic sales climbed 10%.","“Expectations were creeping higher into the print, but P&G far exceeded even the most optimistic expectations,” Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog said, adding that P&G’s organic sales growth of 7% was its strongest in 13 years.","The company’s net sales rose 3.6% to $17.09 billion in the fourth quarter, beating analysts’ average estimate of $16.86 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv."

In the long term, it hopes to use 100 percent renewable or recycled materials for all products and packaging.","Roberto Marinucci, P&G’s vice president of global baby wipes, sustainability and the joint venture, said the company had still not established whether consumers would be willing to pay a premium for diapers they know are going to be recycled, but it was clear they want brands to care about the environment.","“We believe that the first reason, which is doing the right thing for the consumer, is sufficient enough to convince us to go ahead with the project,” Marinucci said in an interview.","Under EU regulations, Fater cannot sell the output of its diaper recycling operation, located near Venice, until it proves there is a market for it. To that end, it has been working on prospective clients and now has 11 letters of intent with businesses like bioplastic manufacturers and paper mills.","P&G is also part of an EU-backed group of 13 companies developing end products for the output. They include bioplastic manufacturer, Novamont, which can use the cellulose to make pharmaceutical ingredients.","Fater says the plastic from recycled diapers can be used to make school desks and urban playgrounds, cellulose can become viscose fabric or specialty paper, and super-absorbent polymer can be used in gardening and flood barriers.","P&G has no plans to use Fater’s output in its diapers, which include Pampers and Luvs, until it completes consumer research on the idea, Marinucci said. In the interim, he said, the company may use the plastics for bottle caps.","The biggest delay to the project has been regulatory, Marinucci said, but he predicts it will get the EU green light in the next 12 months.","In the meantime, after several years in development, Fater’s plant is operating at about a third of its 10,000-tonne annual capacity to provide samples and build stockpiles.","The plant expects to generate annual revenue equal to 50 percent of the cost of its machinery, Marinucci said.","“We’re working on well-grounded assumptions, but they’re still assumptions,” he said. If it works, it could be expanded.",Government efforts to resolve the problem of plastics pollution gained urgency last year when China announced it would stop importing foreign waste. China in 2016 took in 7.3 million tonnes of waste plastics - 56 percent of world imports.,"Fater is not the first to attempt diaper recycling. UK-based Knowaste was forced to close its 70,000 tonne-per-year recycling plant in Holland in 2007 after a new incinerator beat it on cost and it was unable to find markets for the final product.",Efforts to open another facility have failed so far but Knowaste continues to invest in technology and is now considering a plant in the Middle East.,"“We were way ahead of the curve and maybe went too soon. But the market is now showing clear signs of maturing,” said company CEO Roy Brown.","Fater’s patented process starts with local waste management utility Contarina SpA, which collects used diapers and other AHP from curbside bins or large users like hospitals from more than 50 local towns, trucking them in to the 1,000-sq meter plant.","After dry cleaning the diapers using contact steam and disposing of the human waste in waste water treatment plants, one ton of AHP waste can yield 150 kg of cellulose, 75 kg of absorbing material and 75 kg of mixed plastic.","Starting at the end of 2020, a small-scale biorefinery in Amsterdam will be able to process the recovered secondary raw materials and convert them into biologically-based products like biodegradable plastics and biofertilizers.","Guy Schanschieff, founder of UK-based reusable diaper brand Bambino Mio, says he has seen others try and fail to recycle diapers over the years. For one thing, busy parents can’t always deposit diapers in the required bins, he said.","“At the end of the day, it’s a disposable product and it’s going to be thrown away,” said Schanschieff, who is also chairman of the Nappy Alliance trade group.",“Not creating the waste in the first place is always going to be the best thing.”

Is P&G still theoretically on the hunt for Pfizer?”",Bernstein analysts noted that the Pfizer business “may still be an acquisition candidate (for P&G) since it doesn’t seem to raise anti-trust concerns on the surface.”

The large retailers they sell through face their own pressure to keep prices down, as they battle new competition from drugstores and Amazon.com.","The result has been mounting tension, which recently erupted in a clash between Nestle and European retailers that saw some of the Swiss company’s goods briefly taken off store shelves. That row was itself an echo of a 2016 standoff between Unilever and British supermarket giant Tesco.","On Thursday, results from both European manufacturers suggested those tensions remain high. Nestle’s 2.8-percent underlying sales growth only got a 0.2 percent boost from higher prices, and Unilever’s 3.4 percent growth just a 0.1 percent lift.","“We expect chronically weak pricing from both Unilever and Nestle to play to the market’s fears of weak pricing power, fueled by channel shift, in the face of rising commodities (prices),” Jefferies analyst Martin Deboo said.","The pricing pressure was even tougher for Procter & Gamble, the world’s largest consumer goods maker, which on Thursday reported a disappointing 1-percent rise in third-quarter organic sales as lower prices offset a 2-percent rise in the volume of goods moved.","“What is clear is what it takes to win has gotten more difficult,” P&G Chief Executive David Taylor said on a post-earnings call.","The maker of Gillette razors, which said sales would continue to hurt from pricing in the fourth quarter, flagged higher transportation costs in addition to pressure from struggling retailers and rising commodities prices.","Railroads and truck fleets have raised prices amid a shortage of drivers, reduced capacity, higher fuel prices and a strengthening U.S. economy.","“I think everybody is feeling this a little bit,” Unilever Finance Chief Graeme Pitkethly said, predicting that industrywide freight costs in the U.S. could rise by a high single-digit to double digit rate.","P&G and Unilever shares fell more than 2 percent, while Nestle’s were up 0.2 percent. Nestle investors looked past the pricing issue at the Swiss food giant to the fact its overall sales exceeded expectations after several disappointing quarters.","That beat, and a pick-up in volume, is welcome news for Nestle’s new CEO Mark Schneider, who took the top job at the maker of KitKat chocolate bars and Maggi soups in 2017 with the mission to return it to solid growth after six years of decline.",Schneider said underlying growth would improve during 2018.,"“The mood of European consumers is proving to be rather less optimistic in the first quarter of 2018 than at the end of last year,” the group said on Thursday. “In France and Austria, in particular, the euphoria appears to have diminished temporarily in the wake of the elections.”","Consumer goods makers and retailers are always in complex negotiations around pricing and promotions to suit their ambitions. If a manufacturer wants to take market share, it might discount; alternately, it may seek price increases to boost margins.","Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said trends suggested Unilever and some of its peers had “blinked a little” on pricing due to growing competition, even though they represent powerful, established brands.","“Brands are still a vital part of any company’s pricing power armoury but ... some companies are stronger in the food chain than others, depending on size, route to market and the availability of alternatives,” Mould said.","This is Unilever’s second quarter of volume-led sales growth, after several quarters fueled by pricing. CFO Pitkethly said the earlier price rises, and corresponding weak volume, were partly due to currency-related inflationary pressures in certain markets that have since abated, giving consumers more confidence to spend on everyday items.","As a result, sales volume in emerging markets, where Unilever does the majority of its sales, was ahead of expectations, according to Barclays analysts.","“The good news is when you have more muted pricing, more consumers buy more of your brands,” Pitkethly said, adding that minimal commodity price inflation had also inhibited the ability to raise prices.","He said the main pricing trouble spots were Brazil and Indonesia, which both saw prices fall due to weak consumer sentiment; India, due to a tax change put through last year; and Britain, where retail competition is fierce.","These four countries make up 25 percent of Unilever’s sales, Pitkethly said. Other countries, such as Turkey and Mexico, saw a good balance, he said.","The overall balance of price and volume would improve in the second half of the year, Pitkethly said. P&G CFO Jon Moeller also said he expects pricing pressures to ease later this year.","All three companies confirmed their sales guidance for the year, with Nestle aiming for 2 percent to 4 percent underlying sales growth, Unilever looking for 3 to 5 percent growth and P&G saying organic sales would be at the lower end of its 2 to 3 percent range.",Unilever said growth in the second quarter would be near the lower end of the range. Nestle also said it was on track to return to mid-single-digit underlying sales growth by 2020.

Procter & Gamble’s 3.4 billion euro splurge on Merck KGaA’s consumer unit, the maker of Seven Seas vitamin pills, will need a booster shot to earn the support of newly appointed board member Nelson Peltz.","Parting with its portfolio of self-declared “lovebrands” is a good move for the German group, which is unconnected to the U.S. pharmaceutical giant of the same name. Merck makes most of its revenue selling prescription medicines and crystals used in smartphones or televisions. That makes it an illogical owner for over-the-counter drugs like pregnancy supplement Femibion. The sector is consolidating, and may come under pressure as consumers switch to online suppliers such as Amazon.","Given those challenges, Merck has secured a good price. The deal values the business at 3.7 times last year’s sales, higher than the 3.3 times that Nestlé paid for vitamin maker Atrium in December.","The appeal for P&G is less clear. Admittedly it is buying a relatively robust business which has seen revenue grow by 6 percent annually over the past two years. That sounds appealing given the sluggish 1 percent sales growth P&G reported in its healthcare division in the quarter ending March. The new owner should also be able to boost margins. The Merck business generated operating profit of 140 million euros last year, equivalent to a margin of just over 15 percent.","Assume P&G can ramp up the unit’s sales growth to 8 percent a year, and slice 10 percent off its cost base, boosting the operating margin to 25 percent. After five years, the business would bring in roughly 244 million euros after tax. The return on invested capital would just scrape over 7 percent, in line with P&G’s cost of capital.","Those are quite bold assumptions. And P&G might struggle to integrate the business. Peltz argued last year that the Cincinnati-based company should do more deals, but criticised its integration of past acquisitions. True, the latest purchase is relatively small for the $197 billion group. But P&G will have to work hard for it to pass the Peltz test."
