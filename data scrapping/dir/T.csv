Already one of the corporate world’s top dividend payers with $14.9 billion spent in 2019, AT&T had raised its common dividend by 2% and bought back $7.5 billion of its stock.","“We are the face of AT&T and we go out of our way to help customers communicate with their families,” said Darren Miller, a 35-year-old technician whose job was cut last July. “But we are a dime a dozen to them. If they can get someone cheaper to do the job, they will do it.”","Miller, who worked in Reseda, California, said he accepted a buyout offer after managers told him he might be laid off later on less generous terms, something he said his local union representatives told him happened to dozens of other employees in the state.","AT&T spokesman Jim Kimberly said most of the workforce reductions “were from voluntary departure offers and attrition” and declined to comment on individual cases. He added the company had for years practiced a “meaningful commitment to all stakeholders” through programs that include worker retraining and environmental and social justice efforts. AT&T also ended share buybacks once the pandemic hit, and has not increased its dividend since, Kimberly said.",Elliott declined to comment.,Some advocates of a socially-minded stakeholder capitalism say AT&T’s case is representative of the hurdles they face in challenging the leverage investors have over U.S. companies.,"The voluntary governance pledge signed by the CEOs didn't spell out specific actions, but had the stated aim of moving away from ""shareholder primacy"". here","Yet while signatories subsequently reduced payouts to shareholders as companies put away cash to shield themselves from the financial fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic, they still give a greater share to investors than those companies that did not sign the pledge, according to a Reuters analysis of data compiled by financial information provider Refinitiv.","The analysis found that the 171 publicly traded companies that signed the pledge returned a median 60% of net income to shareholders during the first three quarters of 2020 through dividends and buybacks, versus a 50% return among the 355 S&P 500 firms that did not sign the statement.","By comparison, in the first three quarters of 2019, the signatories returned a median 73% of net income to shareholders versus a 68% return among the firms that did not sign the pledge, the analysis found.","Tim Gaumer, Refinitiv’s director of fundamental research, said pledge signatories returned more to investors because they had the ability to do so. “It is easier to pay out dividends and buybacks with confidence if your income stream is less volatile,” he added.","Business Roundtable spokeswoman Jessica Boulanger said the analysis didn’t account for how companies spent money they did not return to shareholders, nor for “industry differences, company size and longevity and trends in shareholder returns over time.” She added that signatories had upheld their commitment to work for all stakeholders.",(Graphic: Roundtable signatory companies slash buybacks : ),(Graphic: Roundtable signatory dividends hold up Roundtable signatory dividends hold up: ),‘SIGNALING EXERCISE’,"The CEOs signed the pledge without legally binding their companies and largely without approval from their boards. COVID-19 stress-tested their commitments, as large swathes of the economy were forced to shut down.","The pledge’s lack of detail gave signatories wide discretion in deciding how the pandemic pain would be spread among shareholders, employees and other stakeholders.","“It’s a political signaling exercise that doesn’t mean very much,” said Harvard Law School professor Jesse Fried, who is on the research advisory council of Glass, Lewis & Co which advises investors over how to vote on corporate governance.","Defenders of the Business Roundtable pledge say many contributions to society cannot be measured as easily as shareholder spending or layoffs. For example, JP Morgan Chase & Co pledged $30 billion to address racial injustices, and Apple Inc launched a $100 million diversity drive.","Indeed, some signatories have won praise from progressive-leaning organizations for standing by employees during the pandemic.","Among them, Target Corp raised its minimum wage to $15 an hour in July from $13, which was already well above the $7.25 national level.","Some executives and investors argue that unless companies are attractive to shareholders and keep their stock highly valued, they won’t have the money to invest in their businesses for the benefit of all stakeholders.","“If you don’t have access to capital, then you’re not going to be around long enough to face tough societal issues like climate change,” said Todd Ahlsten, chief investment officer for Parnassus Investments, a San Francisco-based firm with $40 billion under management.","Less than two years after the signing of the pledge, key protagonists at AT&T moved on. Stephenson passed the reins to a successor, and Elliott sold what was once a $3.2 billion stake in the company.","AT&T’s layoffs during the pandemic attracted the attention of Democratic senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, who wrote to the company last July objecting to “corporations using the pandemic as justification for continuing to make anti-worker decisions that are aimed at boosting share price.”","“The long-term interests of our communities and employees cannot be met without attracting investor capital,” AT&T executive vice president Timothy McKone responded in a letter.","BlackRock Inc and Vanguard Group Inc, whose CEOs also signed up to the pledge, were among the AT&T investors who voted down a proposal last April to have an employee representative on the company’s board - a step its advocates argued would give stakeholders a voice.

Firms from JPMorgan to AT&T are rethinking political donations after last week’s Capitol violence. But it’s people like the late Sheldon Adelson and Mike Bloomberg who have far deeper pockets.,"The storming of the seat of U.S. government has spurred a sea change in corporate America. AT&T, the biggest company spender in the last election cycle, said on Monday that it is suspending political donations to Republican lawmakers who objected without evidence to the November presidential election, in which Joe Biden defeated Donald Trump. Others, like JPMorgan, paused their giving altogether to reassess their strategy.","If the funding hiatus continues, that will hurt Republicans, especially, as they seek to gain majorities in Congress in the 2022 midterm elections. Through political action committees, or PACs, AT&T contributed more than $2.6 million to candidates in the last cycle while JPMorgan doled out about $1 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.","But wealthy individuals give far more. Casino mogul Adelson, who died on Monday, and his wife Miriam were the top contributors for the 2020 election, spending $218 million to back Republicans. Bloomberg came in second with $152 million to support Democrats.","An end or pause in spending by these billionaires would have a big direct impact on candidates. Blackstone’s Steve Schwarzman gave $20 million to the Senate Leadership Fund in the months leading up to the November election and then handed out another $15 million to the group to help two Republican candidates in this month’s Georgia runoff races for the upper chamber, which collectively cost more than $830 million. Democrats ended up winning, splitting the Senate 50-50 with Vice President-elect Kamala Harris set to cast tie-breaking votes.","One Republican feeling heat is Senator Josh Hawley of Missouri, who spearheaded the challenge to the election results and showed support for Trump supporters before they ransacked the Capitol. Hallmark Cards said it had asked Hawley to return $7,000 in PAC donations over the last two years. But that pales compared to the $250,000 that Citadel’s Ken Griffin gave to a so-called super PAC that supported him in his 2018 Senate bid. Taking that kind of money out of campaigns would really make candidates sit up and listen."

It’s a big blow to chains like AMC Entertainment, which depend on opening box office weekends to rake in money.","The decision can be deciphered in two ways. It signals doubt people will rush back to the movies anytime soon. But perhaps more telling, it says that AT&T wants to reserve its content to help boost its streaming efforts.

But if the script is a hit, it may spawn several sequels unwanted by exhibitors. (By Jennifer Saba)","K STREET. The decline in U.S. advertising spending this year will likely be not as bad as originally feared. A new forecast from GroupM, the media arm of ad giant WPP, believes advertising will fall 9% to about $215 billion rather than the 13% predicted in June. Throw in political campaigns and the picture looks even better with a decline of 4%. The pandemic has pushed small businesses to advertise online who otherwise might not have – presumably because real-world customers are harder to come by.","The recovery though will be K-shaped – one part going up while another goes down. Digital advertising is expected to rise 5% partly on the strong third-quarter performances of Alphabet’s Google, Facebook and Amazon.com, and could next year represent 55% of all ad spending. The outlook is grim for print, though: a 20% decline for magazines and a 30% drop for newspapers. Combined, they’re unlikely to top $10 billion in ad spend, versus a peak of more than $90 billion more than a decade ago. With regulators already concerned about the dominance of technology firms, these figures could strengthen their hand. (By Jennifer Saba)","GHOST RIDER. Brooks Running, the Berkshire Hathaway-owned sports shoe and apparel company, could see its 2020 revenue jump 27% versus 2019, with $1 billion in sales possible next year. While runners weren’t able to compete in races like the Boston Marathon this year, the company gained 1.6 million new runners, chief executive Jim Weber highlighted this week. Free time and closed gyms may have pushed many stir-crazy people to lace up.","Like many Warren Buffett-approved firms, Brooks has brand power. In a 2020 Running USA survey, it was voted the top running shoe brand by a wide margin. That may be why the Seattle-based company posted an almost 50% year-over-year sales spike in the third quarter, while revenue at Adidas and Asics dropped. These firms also aren’t pure plays on running. Brooks may not be able to keep up this rapid pace, but pent-up demand for racing next year suggests it could still hit a PR.

The Zoom boom has been a godsend for the United Kingdom’s cosmetic industry, as flourishing videoconference insecurity leads to a surge in nip and tuck procedures, according to research by care data analysts LaingBuisson. While surgical interventions such as liposuction and breast augmentation were down in the months to August, interest in less invasive “tweakments” – including Botox, laser treatment and “plumpers” – has already returned to pre-Covid levels, when the industry had estimated annual sales of around 3 billion pounds.","Plastic surgery is reckoned to pull in only about a tenth of that, although industry professionals point to a steep rise in male hair restoration as homebound executives fret about their receding manes.

Autumn store closures at the low-end fashion chain will cost it 430 million pounds, worse than the 375 million pound hit it had predicted, its parent Associated British Foods said on Friday. Yet the emergence of “phenomenal” sales as soon as countries including Britain and France lifted their latest lockdowns makes it confident it can grow annual sales and adjusted operating profit in the year to September 2021.","Primark’s resilience is somewhat surprising: the retailer doesn’t rely on online sales, helpful to cushion the blow of store closures.

Extending opening times to 24 hours a day in some stores during the busy Christmas season, as Primark has done, will further help. (By Dasha Afanasieva)","CROSSED WIRES. Covid-19 has slowed economic activity and energy consumption, but the planet might still be worse off when it comes to carbon emissions.

As of September, about 30% of the $12 trillion in fiscal stimulus announced targets sectors that impact the environment, estimates the World Resources Institute.

In the past all the rhetoric typically led to mild fines. This follows Facebook’s July of 2018 record-breaking $5 billion penalty, to settle Federal Trade Commission charges that the company violated a 2012 FTC order by deceiving users about their ability to control the privacy of their personal information. In September of 2019, Google LLC and its subsidiary YouTube, paid a record $170 million to settle allegations by the Federal Trade Commission and the New York Attorney General that the YouTube video sharing service illegally collected personal information from children without their parents’ consent. It looks like Alphabet will be forced to pay some additional fines going forward and submit plans to reconfigure its corporate structure to suffice the U.S. Justice Dept’s concerns.”","DAVID CICILLINE, CHAIRMAN, HOUSE ANTITRUST SUBCOMMITTEE, U.S. HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES","“Antitrust enforcement against Google is long overdue. The Subcommittee’s investigation uncovered extensive evidence showing that Google maintained and extended its monopoly to harm competition. It is critical that the Justice Department’s lawsuit focuses on Google’s monopolization of search and search advertising, while also targeting the anticompetitive business practices Google is using to leverage this monopoly into other areas, such as maps, browsers, video, and voice assistants.”","“The lawsuit will likely take years to be argued in court, and at this stage, the DOJ is not proposing any extreme remedial action, such as breaking apart the company. Such recommendations could be made, however, further into the proceedings. We feel that with over $120 billion of cash, Alphabet is financially able to fight the allegations and pay fines that might result from any government actions. We continue to feel positive about Google’s long-term growth from search advertising, YouTube advertising, and cloud computing, and we are maintaining our Buy rating.”","MICHAEL PURVES, CHIEF EXECUTIVE, TALLBACKEN CAPITAL ADVISORS, NEW YORK","“The market is ignoring this because it’s sort of been factored in for a while. We’ve seen these antitrust things, with Microsoft back several years ago, and we’ve seen Google get slammed with these giant fines – basically it ends up being like parking tickets. Like in Europe, they get these multi-billion dollar fines, and it sucks, and they pay it, and then life goes on. So Google is going to litigate. And the thing is the litigation takes place over a period of years, not months. It’s very hard to price it in. You have to assume this kind of stuff is not going away. Google’s margins are ultimately going to be punished here a bit because they’re going to have take fines or have to redefine their business model in some way. But (Google is) not necessarily going to be disrupted.”",“(The lawsuit) is political theater under the guise of protecting market integrity.”,"“Fierce competition among digital companies vying for small businesses’ advertising and marketing dollars has produced an abundance of free and low-cost digital tools that countless small businesses use to run and grow their business in normal times and that comprise the Digital Safety Net that helps sustain them in times of crisis,” Ward said in a statement.","ANDREW GAVIL, PROFESSOR AT HOWARD UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW AND SENIOR OF COUNSEL, CROWELL & MORING LLP",“It is easier to file an antitrust lawsuit than it is to win one.”,“(States joining the lawsuit is) one of those things where it adds heft but makes it complicated.”,"ART HOGAN, CHIEF MARKET STRATEGIST AT NATIONAL SECURITIES IN NEW YORK",“It’s not that there are no other players in search but people seem to like Google more.

It’s true with Amazon as well, like the Amazon Web Services.”",“It’s very hard for investors to make a decision at this stage.”,“This will be the first time Google has to go to Washington and sit down with regulators and talk about their business.”,"“In a much longer run, there might be a different Google with some of the parts, may be that’s the end result.”","KIM FORREST, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, BOKEH CAPITAL PARTNERS, PITTSBURGH","“It feels like 1998 all over again, with Google replacing Microsoft. It really does feel like the same kind of structure of the lawsuit that Microsoft went through in the 90s.”",“I don’t think anybody wanted to select their own browser. Ultimately they could. This is stuff people weren’t paying for.”,"“What we’re talking about in this new Google lawsuit is the advertisers being hurt. It’s going to raise the price of advertising if you have a monopoly. In the browser wars and even in this you have to ask yourself is a monopoly better serving the participants of the market in the long run? Regardless, governments see monopoly and jump into action.”","“On the plus side, as an advertiser you want to get your ads to the right people. Having a monopoly that understands the people you want to reach is better than you calling every tiny newspaper in America … sometimes you can’t stuff the genie back in the bottle.”",“I love magazines and newspapers ... Advertising has been killed by Google and social networks because that’s where the eyeballs are.”,“In the short term it doesn’t mean anything to investors. In the longer term this is just one more shot at the tech oriented media platforms … this is just one more arrow legislators and regulators are going to be able to throw at electronic or internet advertising platforms. Are advertisers going to elsewhere? I say no because that’s where the eyeballs are for better or worse.”,"NEIL CAMPLING, HEAD OF TMT RESEARCH, MIRABAUD SECURITIES, LONDON","“It’s like locking the proverbial door after the horse has bolted! Google has already got the monopolistic position, has invested billions in infrastructure, AI, technologies, software, engineering and talent. You can’t simply unwind a decade of significant progress, or create new alternative powerhouses or tech ecosystems out of thin air.”","ROBERT PAVLIK, CHIEF INVESTMENT STRATEGIST, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER, SLATESTONE WEALTH LLC, NEW YORK","“(The DOJ) can charge them all they want but these companies probably have more money than the Treasury.

U.S. President Donald Trump, a frequent critic of U.S. cable news channel CNN, which is owned by AT&T, called Elliott’s announcement “great news.”","The New York-based hedge fund, one of the world’s most successful activists, wrote to Dallas-headquartered AT&T on Monday morning, sending a four-part proposal that it said could help lift its stock price by at least 60% by the end of 2021.","The plan ranges from divesting certain businesses, eliminating $5 billion in costs, reviewing how it allocates capital and urging CEO Randall Stephenson, who has led the company since the financial crisis, to stop making acquisitions.","“AT&T has been an outlier in terms of its M&A strategy: Most companies today no longer seek to assemble conglomerates,” the letter said.","Elliott also may push for new directors with operating skills and domain expertise to join the company’s 13-member board, and it noted that investors have previously raised concerns that Stephenson holds both the CEO and chairman titles.","News of Elliott’s stake helped push AT&T’s stock price up more than 4% to a high of $37.78, its peak for the year, though by midday on Monday the gain was 2.7%. AT&T said it would engage with Elliott and review the firm’s views.","For Elliott, which invests some $38 billion in assets and has been working on the investment for over a year, AT&T marks one of its biggest corporate targets to date.","There are some similarities with last year's campaign against Sempra Energy SRE.N, when Elliott also highlighted a conglomerate strategy that it said had failed and cost shareholders considerable cash.","But there are differences as well, with some analysts saying that Elliott had learned lessons on how to approach its targets after the Sempra campaign where it asked for six board seats and settled for two that both sides agreed to.","At AT&T, Elliott struck a conciliatory tone at the start of its letter, calling the company one of the world’s most important companies before critiquing its strategy, leadership and sluggish share price. It stopped short of asking for a specific number of seats and naming the people who might fill them.",People familiar with the situation suggested negotiations between the hedge fund and company may occur quickly and be resolved relatively soon as other shareholders are also concerned by the company’s lack of stock market gains.,Elliott took aim at AT&T’s $85 billion acquisition of media company TimeWarner Inc last year and the $49 billion purchase of satellite television provider DirecTV in 2015.,"“Despite nearly 600 days passing between signing and closing (and more than a year passing since), AT&T has yet to articulate a clear strategic rationale for why AT&T needs to own Time Warner,” Elliott said in a letter to the company’s board of directors.","The TimeWarner acquisition gave it control of HBO and CNN and took more than two years to close, as it was heavily scrutinized by antitrust authorities and even questioned by Trump.","Elliott did not offer details on any missteps it saw in the deal, but said it remained cautious about the benefits of the combination that also brought the TBS and TNT networks, as well as the Warner Bros film studio, producer of the “Batman” and “Harry Potter” films, under AT&T.","The deal was seen as a turning point for a media industry that has been upended by companies like Netflix Inc NFLX.O and Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google, which produce content and sell it online directly to consumers without a cable subscription.","The hedge fund listed businesses, including home security, DirecTV, regional sports networks, CME, Sky Mexico, its Latin American pay TV business (Vrio), Puerto Rican operations and other units as possible sale candidates.","It said AT&T should also appoint third-party advisers to evaluate its operations and organizational structure, with a focus on eliminating inefficiency and creating a faster-moving organization.","AT&T has missed revenue expectations five times in the past eight quarters, according to Refinitiv data.",Elliott said a strategic review will help AT&T to pay down debt rapidly through divestment and increase its financial profile.

AT&T’s wireless network provides the phone location data to illustrate store visits, while its broadband business gives information on website visits, Welch said.",A major reason behind AT&T’s purchase of media company Time Warner was the desire to exploit customer usage data from AT&T’s 25 million TV households and an estimated 150 million U.S. wireless customers by WarnerMedia’s networks. Advertisers have long sought to use customer data to boost chances of a sale by tailoring advertisements to households based on their interests.,"Turner and Xandr executives said customer data will remain anonymous and will be tracked in aggregate, never narrowed down to one particular household. Instead, the companies can produce a report that compares households that saw an ad and subsequently visited a business versus households that were not served the ad, without identifying the customers.","“The holy grail is getting clients off of guaranteeing on traditional audience measurement...and taking it a step further and guaranteeing against a business outcome,” said Donna Speciale, president of Turner ad sales, in an interview last week.",The companies also said branded content created by advertisers in partnership with Turner can now be targeted for delivery to specific households among the more than 15 million that have upgraded set-top boxes able to receive so-called addressable advertising.,Advertisers can now also use Xandr data to help them place ads on Turner’s digital properties like CNN Digital and sports website Bleacher Report.

First, President Donald Trump, who has famously tangled with Time Warner’s CNN, has vociferously opposed the deal. Second, it is a rare instance of the government seeking to stop a merger of a distributor and a supplier.","Much of the argument focused on how AT&T, which owns DirecTV, would use the threat of withholding Time Warner’s Turner content, including CNN, in licensing disputes with rival pay TV companies. The government had argued that the threat of a blackout, withholding the content, would force the smaller companies to pay more, thus raising prices for consumers.","AT&T lawyer Peter Keisler cast doubt on this economic model but faced questions over an arbitration offer that AT&T made to smaller pay-TV companies, pledging that it would not black out Time Warner’s Turner content for seven years. “Of course, we will honor it,” he said.","The Justice Department’s Murray said the offer was “too little, too late.” He said the smaller pay-TV companies worried that it was inadequate to protect them.",The government is asking for the lower court case to be reversed and remanded.,"The merger, which was announced in October 2016, closed on June 14 shortly after Leon ruled the deal was legal under antitrust law.","AT&T, the No. 2 U.S. wireless carrier by subscribers, agreed in June to manage Time Warner’s Turner networks separately from DirecTV, including setting prices and managing personnel, until February 2019 or the conclusion of the government’s appeal.","The deal was seen as a turning point for a media industry that has been upended by companies like Netflix Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google which produce content and sell it online directly to consumers, without requiring a pricey cable subscription."

For AT&T, the answer seems to be about $100 million. That’s how much the telecoms group may charge streaming service Netflix to show the hit TV show of that name for another year. Given AT&T’s plans to launch its own video service, depriving a rival of a blockbuster might have been smarter.","Netflix founder Reed Hastings has done a service to die-hard Ross and Rachel fans who had an online meltdown when it appeared “Friends” might be leaving the platform. On the face of it, though, he is paying a high price. The $100 million reported by the New York Times is more than triple what Netflix originally paid.","That said, the $120 billion Netflix ought to be able to tell a bad deal from a good one. The service has a vast trove of data on what its 130 million viewers want to watch. Sure, Hastings is spending on programming like a drunken sailor – Netflix’s streaming content obligations are nearly $19 billion – but that is because he anticipated a bitter war with other media companies. Walt Disney’s Bob Iger, for instance, is pulling most of the Magic Kingdom’s fare off Netflix in preparation for its own forthcoming video product.","The big mystery is why Dallas-based AT&T would want Netflix to have “Friends” at all. It is planning to roll out its own direct-to-consumer video service in the fourth quarter of next year, having bought Time Warner for $85 billion. AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson said on Tuesday the goal is not to become another Netflix. But it’s not like that would be a bad thing: Netflix’s stock has doubled in two years, even after the recent tumble in tech shares.","Stephenson could have held out, watched Netflix users weep via Twitter, and transferred the show to, say, his own struggling DirecTV Now service. The fact he didn’t raises the possibility that AT&T really wants the money. A $220 billion company shouldn’t need to scrape around for such relatively tiny amounts, but this one has roughly $180 billion in debt to pay down. Either way, sharing “Friends” with Netflix suggests AT&T isn’t cut out for the media shark-tank."

The merger, first announced in October 2016, was also opposed by President Donald Trump.",Leon ruled that the tie-up between AT&T’s wireless and satellite businesses with Time Warner’s movies and television shows was legal under antitrust law.,"AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson told reporters on Thursday at a conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, that the company was not surprised about the Justice Department’s decision to appeal.","“They have the right to appeal. Everyone has the right to appeal. We have a very fact-based thoughtful order. It will be evaluated on those grounds,” he said.",A Justice Department spokesman declined to comment.,"The Justice Department opted in June not to seek an immediate stay of the court’s approval of the merger, allowing the deal to close on June 14. The Justice Department still had 60 days, however, to appeal the decision approving the merger.",The government’s notice of appeal filed in U.S. District Court in Washington did not disclose on what grounds it intends to challenge the approval.,"Michael Carrier, an antitrust expert at Rutgers University, said the Justice Department could challenge Leon’s analysis of the facts of the case, the economic arguments given or what Carrier described as an apparent pro-defendant approach by the judge.","Leon had sharply urged the Justice Department not to seek a stay of his ruling, saying it would be “manifestly unjust” to do so and not likely to succeed. In his ruling, he said the government had failed to show competitive harm.",AT&T told the Justice Department in a June 14 letter that it would manage Time Warner’s Turner cable television networks as part of a separate business unit and take other steps until February 2019 or until any government appeal.,"AT&T also said that in the short term, it would have no role in setting Turner prices and the number of Turner employees and target compensation and benefits would remain “largely unchanged.” AT&T also said it would implement a firewall between Turner and AT&T to prevent the exchange of sensitive information of unaffiliated programmers or distributors.","In 2016, the Justice Department had demanded that AT&T sell the Turner networks, which include CNN, as part of approving the merger.","John Bergmayer, senior counsel at advocacy group Public Knowledge, said that since the deal was approved, AT&T had raised prices for some video and wireless services.","“The AT&T-Time Warner transaction is a bad deal for consumers and competition,” he said. “Judge Leon’s decision contained numerous errors, and we believe the DOJ’s position should be vindicated.”",Deals approved by a federal judge have been undone on appeal in the past.,"In 2001, H.J. Heinz Co called off its acquisition of Beech-Nut after an appeals court overturned a lower court’s decision to allow the merger. The Federal Trade Commission had argued the deal would have merged the No. 2 and No. 3 baby food makers and that competition would be “lessened substantially” if it were to go forward."

In April, the company said it lined up £23bn (US$32bn) of loans led by BAML and Wells Fargo.","The existing credit comprises up to £16bn of 364-day bridge loans and up to £7bn of term loans, with the bridge expected to be replaced in part or in full by senior unsecured bonds, LPC previously reported.",BAML and Wells Fargo declined to comment.,"The AT&T victory “does make people feel a bit more of a risk appetite for complex transactions on the regulatory front,” said another banker.","Vertical transactions tend to be better for the M&A market because they allow companies to get into complementary areas for growth, as opposed to horizontal deals which focus more on synergies and cost cutting, he said. “That can be pretty helpful to the overall M&A market.”","Corporations buying other companies for growth have helped drive total M&A lending up to US$326bn so far this year, a 39% leap above the same time last year, according to LPC data.","Attention shifts next to Disney, and whether it answers Comcast’s bid by increasing its US$52bn all-stock agreement to purchase Fox’s film, television and international businesses.","And still in the regulatory review line is T-Mobile’s US$26bn proposed merger with Sprint, two leading wireless carrier competitors, in what is considered a horizontal deal.","As for Comcast’s new financing, banks typically provide “highly confident” letters as a tactic used for large hostile takeovers, that allows borrowers to avoid paying fees on funds committed by banks to a huge deal that may not take place.","Banks do not immediately tie up their balance sheets, as a result, while signaling to markets that financing will be there if the deal is approved.","Similarly, five initial banks indicated their confidence this way last November for chipmaker Broadcom’s unsolicited bid to buy rival Qualcomm. The lending group was later expanded and provided US$100bn of financing – the largest loan package ever – before the deal was ultimately canceled as President Trump blocked the merger over national security concerns.",Banks remain eager to put money to work and see a more open dealmaking path after the AT&T/Time Warner merger outcome.,"“Now that the judge has given the all-clear, without conditions, it’s basically a free ride, and this will open up other opportunities for companies in the space that need to position themselves,” a third banker said."

The U.S. Department of Justice’s total loss in court batters the tough but savvy reputation earned years ago under President Barack Obama. Flimsy legal theories flummoxed experts while stalling other possible deals like a Comcast bid for assets of Twenty-First Century Fox. After Tuesday’s court decision, the watchdog can expect fresh charges of putting politics over the law.","Federal Judge Richard Leon’s ruling allowing the $85 billion merger to proceed was, in legal terms, a slam dunk. His refusal even to impose any conditions on the deal vindicates serious doubts about whether the challenge should have ever been brought.","The Justice Department hasn’t sued to block this kind of transaction – a so-called vertical merger – since 1977, when it failed to squelch Hammermill Paper’s acquisition of two distributors. Combining companies in different, if complementary, businesses just doesn’t raise the anticompetitive concerns of horizontal mergers, which involve direct rivals and might result in raised prices or reduced quality if they are allowed to combine.","AT&T, essentially a distributor of shows and other content, and Time Warner, a content creator, overlap in the horizontal sense only to the extent of AT&T’s indirect stake in MLB Network and a few similar channels. Otherwise, this was a classic vertical merger that the companies argued would strengthen competition against tech giants like Amazon and Netflix.","Trump’s trustbusters disagreed, contending the combined firm might charge cable competitors more for HBO and other Time Warner content, withhold programming over pricing disputes and undermine emerging online alternative distributors like Sling TV. That was always a stretch, considering that Time Warner derives about half of its revenue from fees charged to an array of distributors and denying them content could eat into those sales. And nothing about the merger seemed to make higher prices likelier than they were before the transaction. What’s more, Justice Department projections of the deal’s cost to consumers proved significantly exaggerated at trial.","DOJ antitrust boss Makan Delrahim tried to calm fears and confusion over his aggressive tack with assurances that “our approach to vertical mergers has not changed ... most vertical mergers are procompetitive or competitively neutral.” Yet targeting the AT&T-Time Warner deal injected damaging uncertainty into the market. For example, it handed the Fox board, which had agreed to a $52 billion asset sale to Walt Disney, an excuse to dismiss a competing and perhaps superior bid from Comcast because of “regulatory risks.”","The real damage, though, may have been done to the Justice Department itself. After weak efforts under President George W. Bush, antitrust enforcers flexed their muscles under the Obama administration, gunning down major beer, hospital and airline deals. Pummeling the likes of food-service giants Sysco and US Foods at trial gave the DOJ credibility in court. The clear message that department lawyers would go to the mat killed, for example, General Electric’s sale of its stoves, cook-tops and ovens business to Sweden’s Electrolux. Even overreaches such as a challenge to the merger between US Airways and American Airlines parent AMR ended in face-saving settlements.","Critics of Obama’s antitrust enforcers might say they had a strong track record only because they played it safe – or, more charitably, knew how to pick their spots – and that Delrahim was at least trying to get more aggressive. Even allowing an element of that, the AT&T case was a bad call. The current watchdogs have now largely squandered their department’s hard-earned credibility – and with a lawsuit whose origins always raised questions.","In 2016, then-candidate Trump had already slammed Time Warner-owned CNN as “fake news” and said his administration would not approve an AT&T merger with Time Warner “because it’s too much concentration of power in the hands of too few.” He and Delrahim have denied any White House pressure, but it’s reasonable to wonder how else such a boneheaded legal move could have happened.","The potential harm is serious. Even the perception of weakness could skew the give-and-take over future antitrust enforcement in favor of companies. Dealmakers may take threats to block mergers less seriously and trustbusters might more readily back down, fearing another embarrassing loss. Dodgy deals could go unchallenged. What’s more, judges may now view the government’s allegations of antitrust violations with greater skepticism.","These developments come as legitimate concerns are brewing over vertical combinations that create tightly integrated companies. Thanks to the influence of Yale law professor Robert Bork, current U.S. antitrust law says size doesn’t matter as much as competitive pricing and efficiency. Yet the rise and influence of Alphabet’s Google, Amazon and other mega-firms has cast doubt on that proposition, especially in the media industry: Unlike Hammermill paper products, shows like “Game of Thrones” are not fungible.","As Europe has already acknowledged, sheer size may alone amount to a sort of market power. Exactly how has not been tested recently in American courts, and it probably deserves to be. The Justice Department’s failure to show that it’s up to the task may be the real significance of this week’s loss in court."

Cable network owner Discovery Inc saw shares increase 3.2 percent while mobile providers, Sprint Corp and T-Mobile US Inc, which are waiting for a government approval of their own, also saw a bump following the decision.",AT&T said that controlling Time Warner’s cable brands will help it craft new types of content to retain its customers as web-based rivals like Netflix Inc woo audiences away from traditional pay-TV subscriptions.,"For cable companies feeling the pain of cord-cutting, similar deals for coveted media brands could help them build out new content offerings and offset expected declines in revenues, analysts and dealmakers told Reuters.","The Justice Department had argued that AT&T’s acquisition of Time Warner would allow it to charge premium prices to rivals who relied on its Turner and HBO channels to woo customers to their cable plans, potentially giving it an unfair advantage in the pay-TV market. Now this will be a less of a concern for companies.","“This decision could serve as a ‘green light’ for other potential M&A, including Comcast’s ongoing pursuit of FOX,” said John Hodulik, an analyst at UBS, in a note.","Regulators will still likely scrutinize similar deals, and there is no guarantee that the district court’s approval of AT&T’s merger with Time Warner means that other major media acquisitions would be approved, several antitrust attorneys told Reuters.","Still, at least one company, Comcast, the largest U.S. cable provider, had been waiting for the court decision before making any large M&A moves in media, sources have said.","Rival cable company Comcast is now likely to go ahead with its planned attempt to woo Fox away from Walt Disney Co, which said it would acquire most assets of the media company for around $50 billion last year.","“Regardless of what happens on the appeal front, expect Comcast to put forth an all-cash bid in the next day or so at a premium to Disney,” said Mary Ann Halford, senior adviser to OC&C Strategy Consultants.","Comcast is aiming to gain control over Fox assets such as its Twentieth Century Fox Film and TV studios, which includes brands ranging from X-Men to The Simpsons, as well many of its cable networks.","The court ruling could also open the door for Verizon, AT&T’S main rival, to bid for a media company, UBS’ Hodulik added.","However, in Verizon’s most recent quarterly earnings call, executives said they would rather sit out the current consolidation, and instead build out its content offerings through partnerships with independent media companies.","It also appointed a new chief executive officer earlier this month, Hans Vestberg, the company’s chief technology officer, in a move that signaled Verizon would likely double down on its existing telecommunications business.","Still, one potential target for Verizon would be a combined CBS Corp and Viacom Inc, analysts have said, assuming that on ongoing legal battle between CBS’s controlling shareholder, Shari Redstone, and the company’s board, is resolved.","In a recent court filing, Redstone said her long-term plan was to create a combined company, which would unite media assets including CBS’ broadcast networks, Showtime, MTV, Comedy Central and Nickelodeon, and then sell it.","Halford, from OC&C added, “All I know is that this will be a blockbuster summer for media mergers!”"

This is a judge who is very good and takes the law seriously, and he just didn’t have the stepping stones to get to where the Department of Justice wanted him to go.”","DAVID GLICKMAN, CEO, ULTRA MOBILE AND MINT MOBILE, CALIFORNIA:","“I’m not sure the judge or the Justice Department considered all the impacts this merger could have on smaller competitors,” Glickman said, who said he tried to buy an advertisement on DirecTV, but was rejected because his company is a competitor of AT&T. “At the same time, if this decision helps T-Mobile and Sprint complete their merger, that’s better for consumers.”","BURNS MCKINNEY, PORTFOLIO MANAGER WHO OWNS AT&T, ALLIANZ GLOBAL INVESTORS, DALLAS:","“I wouldn’t call it a huge victory for AT&T, it’s more that they just didn’t lose. You always wonder in these cases if there’s a winner’s curse, given the risk [AT&T] can’t get the desired synergies and they’re taking on a lot of debt with the merger.”","GENE KIMMELMAN, PRESIDENT AND CEO OF PUBLIC KNOWLEDGE, FORMER CHIEF COUNSEL FOR U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE’S ANTITRUST DIVISION, WASHINGTON:","“This is a very disappointing result. We’re most concerned that this will open the floodgates to mergers among the largest and entertainment and transmission companies, further consolidating the power of dominant cable and satellite companies. The end result for consumers is that online video is unlikely to break the large bundles and high monthly charges that consumers have been oppressed with for decades. All video will effectively go through the portals of these dominant providers and Internet video will remain and add on to the high price of broadband and cable service.”",“It’s a very disappointing result for consumers. I think it also sends the wrong signal to the market place at a time when the public is increasingly worried about giant tech companies’ growing dominance over the market place. This unfortunately sends the signal that those companies as well can continue to gobble up adjacent properties and grow their market power.”,"“This is all headed in the wrong direction for the goal of promoting more consumer choices, lower prices and greater innovation in the market place.”","“This was much what we expected would happen almost two years ago that the deal would eventually go through. Obviously, it’s not a done deal yet, it sounds like appeals are still possible. But, in terms of progressing toward the kind of outcome we always expected would occur, we are here.","Given what’s evolved over the last year in particular, it does mean there will be more M&A to the extent that there were mergers or acquisitions which were held up because they wanted to see how this plays out so, I think Comcast has already indicated it will bid for Fox, that could have happened regardless of this ruling but, it almost certainly will now.","This trend toward consolidation among conglomerates has been persistent. If AT&T had lost, that might have caused less M&A, but this keeps open the realm of possibilities of combinations.”","J.B. HEATON, ATTORNEY AND CONSULTANT ON LITIGATION AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS, INDEPENDENT PRACTICE, CHICAGO:","“In 18 years of legal practice, I’ve never heard a judge say you should not appeal. That’s as close to him saying the government’s case was frivolous. That’s a legal shocker. I think we’ll see now that companies will be much more confident about vertical mergers.”","“The ruling ... represents a major turning point in U.S. antitrust law, as it limits the power of the federal government to block vertical mergers purely out of a desire for structural rather than behavioral remedies. This policy point has been the cornerstone of antitrust policy under the Trump administration. The decision will make it more difficult for the DOJ and FTC to block vertical deals in the future, and will likely lead to a wave of vertical M&A in the near term. This decision bodes well for other vertical deals currently under review such as (Aetna Inc-CVS Health Corp) AET/CVS, (Express Scripts Holding Co-Cigna Corp) ESRX/CI, and Twenty-first Century Fox Inc-Walt Disney Co) FOX/Disney.”","ERIC SCHIFFER, CHAIRMAN AND CEO OF PRIVATE EQUITY FIRM PATRIARCH, GREATER LOS ANGELES AREA:",“You are witnessing the single biggest day this century in the marriage of large media with giant distribution. Fox surges in interest because of this ruling with a voracious Comcast that won’t want to back down. Verizon now will go into massive hunting mode and a CBS Verizon tie-up is a real possibility. The probabilities of a Sprint/T-Mobile deal became powerfully more realistic.”,"BRETT SAPPINGTON, DIGITAL ENTERTAINMENT RESEARCH DIRECTOR, PARKS ASSOCIATES, DALLAS:","“If you’re AT&T, who do you want to include in your own skinny bundle? The channels you own. This means if you’re a small content network, you have less negotiating power, because the bundler owns its own content.”","Sappington added that without conditions, AT&T doesn’t have to guarantee anything other than its promise that it will play nice with other distributors and content providers.",“That’s a big win for AT&T.”,“We are disappointed with the Court’s decision today. We continue to believe that the pay-TV market will be less competitive and less innovative as a result of the proposed merger between AT&T and Time Warner. We will closely review the Court’s opinion and consider next steps in light of our commitment to preserving competition for the benefit of American consumers.”,"DANIEL IVES, CHIEF STRATEGY OFFICER AND HEAD OF TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH, GBH INSIGHTS, GREATER NEW YORK:","“With Judge Leon ruling in favor of letting the landmark AT&T/Time Warner $85 billion deal to go ahead as planned this afternoon despite DOJ anti-trust concerns, the impact from this decision will have wide reaching ramifications across the telecommunications, media, and tech industry for decades to come.”",“For AT&T and Time Warner this is a ‘major victory lap’ as having these combined media and entertainment assets under the hood of AT&T will significantly enhance streaming endeavors and cross pollination going forward with a major shot across the bow toward other cable and wireless players as this telecommunications and media behemoth is now hitting the ground running.”,"“In particular we would expect aggressive bundling of HBO, CNN, and other proprietary sports content (NBA, NCAA, MLB) from Time Warner into the AT&T network as a key incentive for current and new AT&T wireless customers.”","“With the AT&T ruling to move the deal forward, Comcast and Roberts will likely throw their hat in the ring in its quest to battle Iger and Disney for these unique entertainment assets that will propel the eventual winner to become a major streaming player and content rich behemoth for years to come.”","JEFFREY LOGSDON, MANAGING DIRECTOR, JBL ADVISORS, CALIFORNIA:","“For AT&T, birth of vision in deal to buy TWX.

U.S. District Judge Richard Leon found little to support the government’s arguments that the deal would harm consumers, calling one position “gossamer thin” and another “poppycock.”","The ruling could also prompt a cascade of pay TV companies buying television and movie makers, with Comcast Corp’s bid for some Twenty-First Century Fox Inc assets potentially the first out of the gate.","The merger, including debt, would be the fourth largest deal ever attempted in the global telecom, media and entertainment space, according to Thomson Reuters data.

If it’s narrow, like ‘I don’t think Time Warner content is that must-have,’ that may have implications in a similar merger in the telecommunications space but may not have a drastic effect in other vertical mergers,” said Caroline Holland, who was in the Antitrust Division during the administration of former President Barack Obama.",A big win for the Justice Department would send shudders down the spines of M&A bankers pursuing deals where a company seeks to merge with a supplier.,"Already one deal depends on the ruling: Comcast Corp CMCSA.O said in May that it was preparing a higher, all-cash offer for most of the media assets of Twenty-First Century Fox FOXA.O, but sources say it will only proceed if AT&T wins its case.",Two other vertical deals under review are Cigna Corp's CI.N plan to buy Express Scripts Holding Co ESRX.O for $52 billion and CVS Health Corp's CVS.N planned merger with Aetna Inc AET.N for $69 billion.,"Ahead of the court ruling, a top antitrust official at the Justice Department urged investors not to read too much into the decision to sue to stop AT&T from buying Time Warner.","Most proposed transactions were either good for consumers or neutral, said Makan Delrahim, the assistant attorney general for antitrust.","“I understand that some journalists and observers have recently expressed concern that the antitrust division no longer believes that vertical mergers can be efficient and beneficial to competition and consumers,” he said. “Rest assured these concerns are misplaced.”"

It offered an arbitration agreement to small pay TV companies and promised not to black out Turner channels if conflicts arose over pricing Turner content for seven years.,UBS said in a June 6 research note that Time Warner’s share price shows about a 50 percent probability of the deal closing.,Neither the Justice Department nor AT&T will say if they would appeal a loss in court.,Here are some of the scenarios for a ruling on June 12:,"This is obviously the outcome that AT&T seeks, and would allow it to add content sales to its revenue stream, which now depends on wireless sales in a maturing market, landlines and the shrinking pay TV market.","“AT&T clearly is looking for a diversification strategy from a revenue perspective. DirecTV is under strain. This (deal) was a hedge against content costs,” said Mike McCormack, a senior analyst for telecom services at Guggenheim.",This ruling would embolden other pay TV companies or internet platforms -- like Comcast or Google -- to buy content.,"Comcast said in May it was preparing an all-cash offer of more than $50 billion for most of Fox’s media assets, competing with a Disney offer. Sources say it will only go forward if the judge allows the AT&T merger with Time Warner.","If the deal is stopped, AT&T, in particular, would need a new strategy.","Time Warner is in a stronger position to go it alone, and has had a string of solid quarterly earnings reports with unique content like HBO’s “Game of Thrones,” CNN, and Turner Sports’ March Madness basketball.","In contrast, AT&T’s quarterly reports have been up and down over the past two years; with the ups attributed to stronger wireless subscriptions in some instances and the downs often blamed on lost DirecTV subscriptions.","That said, while AT&T has fought tooth and nail to save this deal, one industry analyst argued that losing Time Warner might be good for AT&T.","“I think AT&T would probably be better off if the deal fell through. The value it gets for it (Time Warner) doesn’t generate a sufficient return to justify the cost of the deal,” said Allan Nichols at Morningstar.","The companies may decide to appeal a ruling that requires AT&T to sell DirecTV, with 20 million subscribers, or orders Time Warner to sell Turner to get the deal done.","When the government suggested at trial that AT&T sell DirecTV as an alternative to stopping the deal entirely, Daniel Petrocelli, speaking for the companies, objected strongly, saying: “That is an effort to kill the deal.”","During the trial, Leon asked few questions but many of them focused on the adequacy of the arbitration proposal.","AT&T offered last year to submit pricing disputes with other pay TV companies over Turner’s CNN, sports and other channels to third-party arbitration. The companies offered not to black out programming during arbitration for seven years.","In a court filing, cable provider RCN and others urged the judge to include all Time Warner assets, especially HBO, in the offer and to allow broadcasters to learn what other distributors paid for content as part of the process."

The FCC has never moved to finalize the fine.,"The FCC said at the time that it was the largest such fine proposal.

The Justice Department has said it is illegal because consumers would end up paying more for television while AT&T and Time Warner say they need the deal to compete with internet titans like Facebook Inc and Netflix Inc,"“The government did not even begin to make a credible case that the merger would likely harm competition, substantially or even just a little,” AT&T said in its closing brief. “This is not a close case.

In the absence of blocking it, Conrath urged the judge to consider a divestiture, or asset sale.","Judge Richard Leon asked about the possibility of imposing a remedy, like saying the deal could go forward if the companies sell a particular asset. Conrath said that if the judge found the deal to be anti-competitive then he could impose a fix or a remedy.","In his summation, Daniel Petrocelli, speaking for AT&T and Time Warner, argued against any ruling that would, for example, require AT&T to sell DirecTV, which has more than 20 million subscribers, in order to purchase Time Warner. “That is an effort to kill the deal,” he said.",Leon said that he would likely have a decision on June 12.,"The judge’s decision will guide dealmakers on how aggressive they can be with ‘vertical mergers’, where one company buys another in the same industry but operating at a different point in the supply chain. Regulators approve the vast majority of vertical deals.",‘FAILURE OF PROOF’,"In his closing remarks, Petrocelli argued that the government had failed to prove that the merger was illegal because they had not shown that it would lead to higher prices.","“We have a complete failure of proof,” he said at one point. He argued that the deal would mean half a billion dollars per year in price decreases for pay TV subscribers.","He also criticized a report by economist Carl Shapiro, who has testified that the deal would cost consumers more money because AT&T would have the incentive to withhold Time Warner content like CNN or March Madness basketball from pay TV rivals, both pricey cable companies and cheaper online startups.","And Petrocelli argued that an arbitration offer given by AT&T would take away much of the power to raise prices. In hopes of preventing a court fight, AT&T proposed that for seven years it would submit to third-party arbitration any disagreement with distributors over the pricing for Time Warner’s networks and promise not to black out programming during arbitration.","In his final argument, the Justice Department’s Conrath told the court that AT&T’s Chief Executive Randall Stephenson, who said it was “absurd” that they would withhold content from competitors, also wrote an email to Time Warner’s chief executive Jeff Bewkes to complain after Time Warner took a stake in Hulu, a cheaper online competitor.","“‘It’s hard to imagine how it won’t impact all of our relationships,’” Conrath quoted Stephenson as writing.","Referring to DirecTV, Conrath said that AT&T “wanted to preserve that ‘cash cow’ for as long as they can.” DirecTV lost 187,000 traditional U.S. video customers in the first quarter of 2018.","Two key witnesses at the trial were Stephenson and Bewkes, who is retiring if the transaction goes through. Both were present for the closing arguments, and Stephenson shook Petrocelli’s hand during a break after his summation.","The two executives argued in the trial that marrying AT&T’s granular information about customers with Time Warner’s ability to create compelling video would allow the merged company to advertise more effectively, giving it a fighting chance to compete with internet advertising titans like Facebook Inc and Alphabet Inc’s Google."

Dennis Carlton, from the University of Chicago, testified earlier in the trial that the deal would provide a net benefit to consumers of 52 cents per pay TV subscriber a month.","The government has argued that the proposed deal would spur AT&T to charge its pay TV rivals more for Time Warner content, in particular the Turner family of news and sports shows. It has also said that the combined company would have an incentive to decline to offer content to cheaper online video services in order to slow their development.","The trial, which began in mid-March , is expected to wrap up this month.

He said he was interested in using the new platform.","Advertisers’ spending on TV ads in 2018 is expected to be around $70 billion, a 1.45 percent increase from three years ago, according to research firm eMarketer.","In cross examination, Justice Department lawyer Claude Scott pointed to efforts that Time Warner was already making to move into targeted advertising and online distribution, including contracting with tech companies, an apparent attempt to call into question the need for the megamerger.","Scott referred to Bewkes’ compensation package, noting that he would be leaving the company when the deal closed and that he owned more than 2 million Time Warner shares. AT&T’s deal for Time Warner is about a 35 percent premium over the market price.",The trial has seen a parade of witnesses testifying about how the merger would affect them. Executives from smaller pay TV companies talked about how important it was to have access to Time Warner’s movies and television shows.,"The trial, which began in mid-March in U.S. District Court in Washington, is expected to wrap up this month."
