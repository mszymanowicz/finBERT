The U.S.-based miner told Reuters that the information it has provided already goes beyond Chilean requirements.","Albemarle won approval in 2016 to hike its production from the Atacama flat, by far the biggest source of supply in South America’s so-called ‘lithium triangle.’","Its export permit requires the miner prove its reserves can sustain the increased output. That information is provided to Chilean nuclear agency CCHEN, which oversees lithium exports.","Should CCHEN decide that Albemarle is not complying with its rules, it could suspend that permit.","The high-stakes feud comes as Albemarle pushes to expand production in Chile and take control of Australia’s Greenbushes, the world’s largest lithium mine, to meet an expected tripling in demand for the key battery metal by 2025 as automakers produce more electric vehicles.","Globally, both companies and countries are racing to secure the resources necessary to ramp up EV production, including copper, cobalt and lithium.","Albemarle submitted a report in August 2019 with estimates of its Atacama reserves, documents requested by Reuters under Chile’s Transparency Act show. But when regulators questioned the firm’s methodology, Albemarle declined to provide any more detail.",An attorney for the firm wrote in a December 2019 letter that U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules meant Albemarle was “impeded from providing CCHEN information beyond that already delivered.”,"In late August CCHEN rejected that argument, according to the filing seen by Reuters. It said the “requirements of foreign institutions are not enforceable or applicable in Chile.” The regulator has given Albemarle until Sept. 16 to provide the additional data.","The Chilean agency said Albemarle’s initial report did not include baseline data, calculations or models, making it “impossible” for the regulator to establish how the company had arrived at its resource and reserve estimates.","Albemarle said in a statement sent to Reuters that it had gone above and beyond the regulator’s requirements in its report and had invited CCHEN to its offices to review its “material and supporting documents in detail,” an invitation it said had not been taken up.","“We do not understand CCHEN’s insistence on this point,” Albemarle said in response to questions from Reuters. “We believe that it is an artificial conflict whose origin we cannot understand.”","The salt flat, home to both Albemarle and top competitor SQM, lies amid the world’s driest desert and questions remain about lithium mining’s impact on its fragile ecosystem. Carmakers including Volkswagen and Daimler have ratcheted up scrutiny of the region’s miners ahead of the expected spike in demand.","Chilean regulators said last month they were planning a new, comprehensive management plan of the salt flat. Chile’s government has also long promised, but has yet to deliver, a water study of the Atacama basin to ensure sustainability.","Albemarle has emphasized that it cares for the environment and local communities, including in the Atacama."

Residents and environmental groups worry that mining of lithium and copper is damaging a regional ecosystem home to an ancient indigenous culture and turquoise lagoons inhabited with rare pink Chilean flamingos.,"For Albemarle, the world’s largest producer of lithium, resolving the water issue is a “business decision”, Lenny-Pessagno said, adding the firm was open to working with other miners on the matter including rival SQM.","“Whatever happens in the salar will ultimately impact our business,” she said, confirming the plan for a two-decade monitoring network, beyond what its environmental permits call for, to get a fuller picture of the issue.",SQM said it too was constantly “seeking to improve its production and make it increasingly sustainable.”,"“The company supports any initiative that gives more transparency,” SQM said in a statement emailed to Reuters on Monday.","A separate, government-funded study intended to bolster publicly available information about the salt flat has been repeatedly delayed since 2018, sowing uncertainty. A spokeswoman for Chile development agency Corfo, which is managing that process, said the report was nearing completion.",Salt-rich brine holds in suspension the lithium that automakers covet. Miners use freshwater beneath the flats for industrial processes. Both water and brine are scarce commodities in the world´s driest desert.,"Last week miner BHP BHP.AX scrapped plans to continue pumping water from the Atacama basin to feed its massive Escondida copper mine, the world's largest. It said it would use desalinated water instead.","Albemarle, too, shelved longer-term plans to expand its operations at Atacama following questions from regulators in 2018 about technologies that would allow the company to produce more lithium without pumping more brine.",Rival SQM’s operations are also in limbo after a plan to lessen its environmental impact was thrown out by judges who said a green light from regulators had relied on junk science and warned about a “high level of scientific uncertainty” about the behavior of the Atacama’s water table.,SQM has criticized the court’s ruling and appealed to the Supreme Court. A decision is pending.,Lenny-Pessagno said Albemarle’s near-term focus would be developing technologies to extract more lithium from the brine it already had permits for. She said the company had “no intention of asking to increase our pumping rate.”,"She confirmed plans to open the La Negra III and IV lithium processing plants in Chile by next year, boosting the firm’s production capacity in the country to 85,000 tonnes.","Last May, Albemarle announced a project to boost its Atacama lithium production by 30% without extracting more brine.","When asked if that technology, or others, might help revive plans to produce over 85,000 tonnes, she said both the market and technology would dictate timing.","“These technological improvements take time, it’s still a work in progress. We want to be rational in terms of what our goals are,” she said."

But shortly after applying to renew those permits in 2017, authorities warned the aquifer was overdrawn, stalling the process.",The global miner said in a statement Tuesday it would now substitute its pumping from Atacama with desalinated water from its coastal Chilean plants.,"BHP’s decision is a step toward reducing pumping pressure on the vast, lithium-rich salt flat. The basin sits amid the world’s driest desert, where annual rainfall is often measured in millimeters.","Soaring demand for ultralight battery metal lithium has raised questions about whether Atacama can support future levels of production along with the needs of nearby copper mines, a booming tourism industry and indigenous communities.","“BHP’s decision advances by 10 years its commitment to stop extracting high Andean water for Escondida,” the miner said in the statement.

The agency says the company has yet to explain how its technology will allow it to extract more lithium from the same amount of brine in the world’s driest desert.",Albemarle has been reluctant to provide specific details of the new process first announced in September 2017. The Chilean Nuclear Energy Commission (CCHEN) began asking last March for specifics on the process.,"Albemarle says it “is preparing a revised request addressing CCHEN’s concerns, which are of a technical nature” and that it expects to ultimately receive approval to produce more lithium.","Asked by Reuters in late October for more concrete details on the new technology, Eric Norris, head of Albemarle’s lithium division, said the new process was “very efficient and it’s obviously very sustainable” but gave few other specific details.","“It’s likely some process or technology where you don’t lose lithium to the salts that evaporate out of the ponds,” said Robert Baylis, a lithium analyst with Roskill.","Norris said Albemarle would spend “hundreds of millions of dollars” to build a plant in the Atacama that would further refine brine concentrate to increase the amount of lithium recovered to 80 percent, up from “about half” today. Some industry analysts say the current lithium recovery figure is lower, around 30 percent.","Norris also said the company was spending $1 billion in Chile, its largest area of operations, and hiring more than 1,700 people. But he offered no timeline for the spending and hiring.","""I don't know if they're doing anything proprietary or revolutionary,"" said David Deak, an independent battery industry consultant and former lithium buyer for electric carmarker Tesla Inc TSLA.O. ""It's unclear really what Albemarle has here, and what it means in terms of water usage.""","That usage is closely watched by Chilean regulators, despite the $100 million in royalties the country collects annually from Albemarle, due to concerns about water and brine levels in the Atacama.","Albemarle entered Chile as part of its 2015 buyout of smaller rival Rockwood Holdings, inheriting access to massive lithium reserves.","The company’s lithium process, which relies heavily on evaporation ponds, was designed to extract potash fertilizer from salts, with lithium only as a byproduct.","Tweaking that technology to boost lithium recovery has long been an obsession of Albemarle and SQM. Indeed, rivals in Argentina, including Livent Corp LTHM.N, have developed methods that allow for nearly all lithium in brine to be recovered, a step made possible in part by the different chemical composition of Argentine brine.","Norris said that Albemarle’s process is not the same as Livent’s, without elaborating. Livent, for its part, believes there may be some crossover.","In Chile, Albemarle has repeatedly assured regulators that it is now capable of sharply increasing the amount of lithium it can extract from brine, according to documents obtained by Reuters via a Chilean freedom of information request.","“The modification is made possible because Albemarle has developed a sustainable technology that allows us to increase the efficiency of our processes in the Salar de Atacama without using more brine or water, and as a consequence, produce more tons of lithium carbonate,” Stephen Elgueta, Albemarle’s Chilean manager, wrote to nuclear agency CCHEN on March 23.","On May 3, CCHEN asked Albemarle to provide “details with respect to the technology that would enable the increase.”","The following month, three executives from Albemarle met with CCHEN director Patricio Aguilera at Santiago’s La Reina Center for Nuclear Studies.","According to Chile’s lobbyist transparency website, Albemarle presented its production projections through 2044 during the hour-long June meeting, as well as “some process improvements it is implementing.”",But officials from CCHEN remained unconvinced.,"“The details provided ... during the meeting are insufficient,” wrote Aguilera on June 20, adding that the efficiency improvements touted by Albemarle in the meeting only “justified a percentage of the total [increase in quota]” requested by the company.","Albemarle provided no more information to CCHEN during the nearly three months that followed, according to Chilean regulatory filings.","On Sept. 12, CCHEN formally rejected Albemarle’s March request to increase its quota to sell lithium outside the country.

Lithium-ion batteries are key components for most consumer electronics, from cellphones and laptops to electric cars.","In celebrating the new contracts, the two companies said they were confident they could significantly boost output without drawing more than their current quotas of lithium-rich brine, or saltwater, that has for millennia accumulated in pools beneath the Atacama. The rivals said each had all the brine they needed for current and future production.","“I don’t see any issue with our ability to get (the brine) ... today, tomorrow and throughout the term of that agreement,” which ends in 2043, Albemarle CEO Luke Kissam told investors in August.","But a Reuters review of filings with Chile’s environmental regulator shows Albemarle striking a different tone, expressing concern about how much brine rival SQM had been drawing and the impact that could have on future production from the area.","The true state of the Salar’s water supply, both fresh and saltwater, has become an obsession of lithium industry watchers because of the area’s huge importance in satisfying soaring global demand for the powdery white metal. The area is the most cost-efficient place in the world to mine the metal, and both SQM and Albemarle have staked much of their future production on the Salar.","In the filings, which have not been previously reported, Albemarle voices concern about a 2016 investigation by Chilean authorities that found over a period of several years SQM sucked up more of the lithium-rich brine from beneath the Salar than its permits allowed. ","In a March 2017 filing, for example, Albemarle said it was critical for the authorities to determine how much SQM had overdrawn because that could affect the availability of brine for other projects.","That filing came a month after Eduardo Bitran, who was then head of Chile's state development agency, Corfo, raised similar concerns about the amount of brine SQM had been drawing and other infractions. In a letter to the environmental regulator, Bitran wrote that SQM's actions pose a ""severe risk"" to the ecosystem of the Salar and its brine reserves. ","Chile's environmental regulator has said SQM made changes to how it monitors wells without authorization, making it difficult to track the impact of SQM's pumping on brine supplies.","SQM has not confirmed overdrawing brine. But over nearly two years it has filed four plans with regulators to bring its operations back into line with environmental approvals, which, among other things, specify how much brine SQM can pump. The first three plans were returned to SQM by regulators for further revisions; the latest, filed in September, has yet to receive a response.","Meanwhile, SQM has accused Albemarle of overdrawing brine at its mine and questioned in a filing whether its rival's actions could have repercussions on the availability of brine reserves in the Salar. Albemarle declined comment when asked by Reuters whether that was correct.",Hydro-geologists and environmental chemists consulted by Reuters on the filings said the back-and-forth between the miners underscores widespread concerns over just how much brine is left and how long it will last. They said the filings show that neither the Chilean authorities nor the companies have a clear picture of the water situation at a time when the miners have been given the green light to boost production.,"Lithium analyst Joe Lowry said the filings had potential implications for the global production of lithium, which has become one of the world’s hottest commodities.","“The lithium world is on pins and needles,” he said. When it comes to the Salar, “What is SQM going to be able to do, what is Albemarle going to be able to do production-wise?”",‘RAISES DOUBTS’,"In a recent interview with Reuters, Kissam, Albemarle’s CEO, insisted there was “no question” that there was enough water in the Salar to maintain lithium operations. The company can produce 80,000 metric tons of lithium annually in the Salar - roughly 36 percent of global demand in 2017 - helped by technology it has developed that will allow it to extract more lithium from the same amount of brine, he said.","He declined to comment on the concerns expressed by his company in the regulatory filings about the area’s water supplies. In one such filing, Albemarle said its rival’s compliance plan failed to sufficiently address regulators’ concerns and “raises doubts ... about the sustainability in time of both companies’ operations.”","Kissam also said his company was currently using only the amount of water allowed by regulators. “We´re not overdrawing. We´re pumping at the rates well within our permits,” he said.","For its part, SQM, controlled by Julio Ponce Lerou, a reclusive Chilean billionaire, says it already has all the brine it needs to produce more lithium.","SQM declined to comment on its water fight with Albemarle. It said in a statement to Reuters that its submissions to the regulator spoke for themselves. But, it added, “Our conclusions indicate that neither the environmental sustainability nor productivity of the Salar de Atacama are compromised.”","For Mariana Cervetto, a hydro-geologist who has reviewed technical aspects of the case for both Corfo, the state development agency, and the local indigenous communities that surround the Atacama salt flat, questions still outweigh answers.","“When people ask me, ‘Is the water going to run out?’ I tell them, ‘The truth is, we don’t know,” Cervetto said.","The spat between Albemarle and SQM can be traced back to 2013, when government inspectors arrived at SQM’s installations and found something amiss.",Native Algarrobo trees - hardy desert hardwoods that survive by sending shoots deep into underground aquifers - were shedding their leaves and dying.,"The 23 dead trees represented one-third of those SQM had committed to monitor. Like canaries in a coal mine, the health of the trees was meant to act as an early warning signal of water problems. Two years later, more trees were dying but SQM failed to notify authorities, according to government inspection reports reviewed by Reuters.","“If SQM is extracting more brine than it is permitted from the Salar, that can have repercussions on the availability of reserves in the basin for other projects,” wrote lawyers for Albemarle subsidiary Rockwood Lithium Ltd in the March 2017 filing.",SQM hit back the following month. It wrote to the regulator saying it was “outrageous” that Albemarle was presenting itself as a defender of the environment when Albemarle had acknowledged overdrawing water in 2008 and between 2010-2012. Albemarle declined comment when asked by Reuters whether that was correct.,Corfo submitted a new study on the availability of water in the Salar to the environmental regulator in March that found more water and brine was leaving the system through pumping and evaporation than was coming back in via rain and snowfall.,"In the filing, Corfo said, however, the study couldn't pinpoint which of the copper or lithium miners operating in the Salar was to blame for the imbalance. It said this uncertainty was reason enough for regulators to take steps to restrict extraction. ",That process is now underway. Reuters reported exclusively in August that Chile’s water regulator was preparing restrictions on new water rights in the Salar in part because of uncertainty over how much extraction it can support..

Now, the company is diverging from rivals and developing dozens of lithium products that can help boost electricity storage and increase a battery’s charge.","“What we are doing is not a moonshot, but rather just good engineering,” Albemarle’s lithium unit head, Eric Norris, said at a private dinner earlier this summer attended by State Street Global Advisors, Goldman Sachs Group Inc and other top shareholders, according to two sources.","As more lithium production comes online in the Americas and Asia, concerns about oversupply are high, making a push into specialized lithium a crucial step for Albemarle.","“Lithium is much more a specialty chemical than a mined product,” said Joe Lowry, an independent lithium industry consultant. “It’s definitely not a commodity because it’s not a fungible good.”",Albemarle is now trying to use its technical know-how and clout to forge customer partnerships that it hopes guarantee profit for decades.,"“If every new lithium project that’s been announced does come online, that could cause market oversupply,” said Deutsche Bank mining analyst Chris Terry. “There’s a lot of bearishness in the market and differentiation is the key to success.”",R&D,"By treating the metal with various chemicals and other processing steps, lithium’s chemical structure can be rearranged to boost electricity storage and increase charge, which Albemarle hopes will make it even more indispensable to battery makers and the electric car industry, Norris told the investor dinner.","“Battery requirements are becoming more stringent and there is a definitive move toward higher energy density batteries,” Albemarle spokeswoman Hailey Cobb said.","Longer term, Albemarle is studying so-called “solid state” batteries, which contains no liquid and theoretically can store more electricity than the lithium ion battery, Norris told investors.","While solid-state batteries are not expected to replace lithium ion batteries as the industry standard, they are seen as a promising technological evolution. And importantly for Albemarle, they will consume even more lithium.","So far, Wall Street is rooting for Albemarle’s success. Seventeen of the 22 analysts that cover the stock recommend buying it.
