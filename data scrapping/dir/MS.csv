On Wednesday the company run by James Gorman reported a 57% increase in earnings over 2020, driven by a surge in its stock and bond trading business. Banks can’t rely on a repeat of that, but a stock-fueled M&A spree leaves Morgan Stanley well placed for what comes after.","The $5 billion increase in trading revenue Morgan Stanley reaped last year reflects a street-wide windfall. The biggest five investment banks collectively made $28 billion more than a year earlier, thanks to volatile markets that were kept in working order by supportive central banks. Morgan Stanley isn’t the most sensitive to that kind of move – trading provides just under 40% of total revenue, versus nearly half at Goldman Sachs – but its 30% annual increase in the fourth quarter comfortably beat peers.",Gorman put the odds of that continuing at “less than 50%” on Wednesday; Goldman warned something similar the day before. So the question becomes which of the Wall Street firms is best positioned to live without profitable market swings. Big lenders like JPMorgan and Bank of America suffer when interest rates and loan demand fall. Goldman too has been pushing into retail banking.,"Conversely Gorman’s focus is on the stable business of wealth management. Last year he bought online brokerage E*Trade Financial and is in the process of acquiring asset manager Eaton Vance for a combined $20 billion, most of it in shares. E*Trade attracted almost 1 million new accounts just in the second half of last year. On Wednesday Morgan Stanley raised its estimate of how much money it will save from bringing E*Trade’s low-cost deposits onto its own balance sheet.","That hasn’t gone unnoticed – at $136 billion Morgan Stanley trades at almost 1.5 times its estimated book value a year from now, according to Refinitiv, its highest since at least the financial crisis. The post-Covid-19 world may be different, but still weird in its way. Retail investors have piled frantically into online stock trading, and rising markets together with rock-bottom savings rates may continue that trend.

Logical as that sounds, it’s also rather daring. Handing over big sums to traders and dealmakers is a potentially touchy subject in a pandemic that has cost millions of Americans their livelihood, and brought Wall Street firms’ market makers huge profits. Fortunately, Morgan Stanley is better placed than some peers to share the wealth.","The three months ending in September were kind to the $92 billion firm. Morgan Stanley’s earnings increased by 26% year-on-year, and its $2.3 billion in equities revenue put it back at the top of Wall Street’s slippery pole for stock trading, after sliding behind Goldman Sachs the previous quarter. CEO James Gorman was able to buy brokerage E*Trade Financial, and intends to buy asset manager Eaton Vance, while still having more capital than regulators say he needs.","As a result, this year is shaping up to be a good one for Gorman’s underlings. Trading and investment-banking revenue rose 24% over the year to date, compared with the same nine months in 2019, and pay earmarked for that division rose 26%. That made Morgan Stanley an outlier, at least for now. Goldman paid more in dollars, but less as a share of revenue. JPMorgan’s comparable revenue rose by nearly 30%, but its bankers’ pay increased just 10%.","Gorman has more freedom over pay than some of his rivals. His firm isn’t a giant lender to American consumers and businesses, for one, which puts him less in the crosshairs of progressive politicians. It also means that Morgan Stanley overall isn’t facing a huge slump in earnings this year, unlike all of the big main-street banks against which its traders and rainmakers compete. Gorman’s own relatively low profile doesn’t hurt either.","There’s another difference: Morgan Stanley won props last year for being restrained in Gorman’s pay. Make no mistake, a $27 million award for 2019 is still astronomical by real-world standards. But the Australian-born bank chief took a pay cut in 2019 of $2 million, even though his full-year profit fell less than at his four biggest rivals’ banks. Goldman, in an exceptionally tin-eared moment, awarded David Solomon a 20% raise, after a year when earnings fell by one-fifth. Those are the kind of gestures that endure."

Adding Eaton Vance would nearly double assets under management within the investment management division compared with June 30 and boost the business’s annual revenue by about one-third. “Eaton Vance is a perfect fit,” Gorman said.","Eaton Vance shareholders will receive $28.25 per share in cash and 0.5833 Morgan Stanley shares for each share they hold, representing a 38% premium to Eaton’s closing price on Wednesday. They will also get a one-time $4.25 dividend paid by Eaton Vance before the deal closes.","Subject to regulatory approvals, the two companies expect the transaction to close in the second quarter of 2021.","The deal is good for Morgan Stanley because it will help the bank distribute funds to retail investors since Eaton Vance is the top U.S. distributor of individual separate accounts, Barclays analyst Jason Goldberg said. It may also help grow revenue in an inexpensive way while growing assets, he said.","However, the deal still dilutes shareholders and involves “execution risks” for a bank that has bought a couple of other companies lately, including online retail brokerage E*Trade Financial.","“Morgan Stanley is undertaking another acquisition so soon after E*Trade,” Goldberg wrote in a note to clients.","The Eaton Vance deal bolsters Gorman’s reputation as a CEO who acquires his way to growth, then finds efficiencies to bolster profits.","The most emblematic deal of his tenure was Morgan Stanley’s decision to buy Smith Barney, which was announced in 2009 when he ran the bank’s wealth management business. Gorman was crucial in forging the massive deal, and combining the two companies became his chief task when he was elevated to CEO the next year.","During that time, Gorman boosted the wealth management’s profit margins from single digits to 25-30% in more recent periods.","After a long pause in acquisitions, Morgan Stanley announced last year that it would purchase an employee stock-plan manager for $850 million, and in February said it would buy online stock brokerage E*Trade for $13 billion.","Although Gorman has turned around wealth management through deals, investment management has long been a sore point for the bank.","After the financial crisis, executives tried without much success in turning around performance. The crisis crushed values in some funds, especially real estate, while FrontPoint, a prominent hedge fund it owned, got entangled in insider trading charges.","By 2010, Morgan Stanley also had to comply with the Volcker rule, which limited its own financial commitment to private equity and hedge funds it managed.","Nonetheless, management set growth targets Morgan Stanley struggled to meet.","For instance, in 2014, Morgan Stanley set a goal for its investment management unit of $500 billion in assets under management and a 20% return-on-equity (ROE) by 2016, neither of which it reached in time. It is now surpassing both targets, partly due to soaring market values.","The Eaton Vance deal will certainly help with assets, boosting AUM to $1.2 trillion from $665 billion at June 30. The bank expects combined annual revenue of about $5 billion, compared with $3.8 billion last year.","Morgan Stanley has been looking at Eaton Vance for several years, Gorman said on a conference call with analysts to discuss the deal. He dismissed the idea that Morgan Stanley had overpaid, saying “you pay quality for quality.”","After Eaton Vance, Morgan Stanley is done with deals for awhile, Gorman said. The bank will then focus on incorporating all the companies it has bought and finding ways to make them gel with one another.","Morgan Stanley expects to realize $150 million in annual savings through the transaction. It will have a break-even effect on earnings per share immediately and then become marginally beneficial to EPS, the bank said.","The deal also helps the bank use extra capital in a way that still leaves it about 300 basis points above what the Federal Reserve requires, Morgan Stanley said.","Morgan Stanley shares rose 1.2% to $49.29 in morning trading, while Eaton Vance shares jumped 47.7% to $60.45."

His $13 billion all-share deal to buy online brokerage E*Trade Financial gives Morgan Stanley more stable revenue, higher returns and cheaper funding – in short, just what Solomon’s strategy is designed to achieve.","Gorman’s dive into retail brokerage comes just weeks after Solomon laid out his own grand plan. Part of that entails cutting the cost of funding by $1 billion, which in turn involves replacing expensive debt with customer deposits. Yet building a retail bank takes time. Goldman’s consumer deposits totaled $60 billion at the end of 2019. Morgan Stanley’s E*Trade deal would add almost that much in one go.","Then there’s diversification. Gorman already had a head start after branching into wealth management over a decade ago. Last year, volatile trading income made up around one-third of Morgan Stanley’s total revenue, compared with more than 40% at Goldman. Taking E*Trade’s revenue into account, Morgan Stanley’s reliance on trading would have been around 30%.","Buying a giant online broker isn’t without risk. For Morgan Stanley’s 15,000-plus financial advisers, it might feel like inviting cannibals in for dinner – after all, E*Trade and its rivals recently cut trading commissions to zero. But at least the price is reasonable. The $400 million of expected cost savings alone are worth just over $3 billion today, taxed and capitalized. That neatly covers the $3 billion premium in the announced deal – and the cost reductions will boost Morgan Stanley’s return on equity, too.","So why didn’t Goldman pounce on E*Trade? At $84 billion as of Wednesday, it’s in the same market-value ballpark as Morgan Stanley. One answer is the bank prefers to build its own businesses, and is focusing on other areas like credit cards and transaction banking. But Solomon also has yet to resolve issues surrounding the bank’s role in Malaysia’s 1MDB corruption scandal, potentially making approval from regulators for a big acquisition more of a hurdle.","The window for doing deals may not be open for long. Morgan Stanley expects to own E*Trade by the end of 2020. Soon after, the United States could have a new, less Wall Street-friendly president. There’s probably no better time for Gorman’s move – especially if it puts Solomon on the back foot."

That announcement came just days after federal bank regulators approved the $28 billion merger of BB&T Corp and SunTrust into a new firm called Truist Financial Corp in just nine months.","But such a bold move by Morgan Stanley, one of the riskiest banks in the United States with roughly $900 billion in assets, will test regulators’ limits during an election year in which Democratic primary candidates are burnishing their bank-bashing credentials.","The deal would have to get the green light from the Federal Reserve, and potentially other financial watchdogs. Progressive Democrats say mega-banks put the financial system and consumers at risk, and have called for big lenders to be broken up.","“This is not going to be an easy deal to move through the Federal Reserve. Morgan Stanley is a globally significant financial institution, which means any sizable deal is subject to strict review,” said Jaret Seiberg of Cowen Washington Research Group in a note on Thursday.","Casting doubt on Gorman’s timeline, Seiberg said the approval process could spill beyond the November election during which time the CEOs of both companies would likely have to justify the deal before Congress. The election also poses a risk to the deal, he added, although terms for some key Fed officials do not expire until 2021.",The Federal Reserve declined to comment on the deal.,"Banking deals languished after the financial crisis due to strict capital and liquidity rules imposed on lenders with more than $50 billion in assets, making it unattractive for mid-size lenders to acquire more assets. Regulators also aggressively enforced rules that allow them to bar firms with compliance issues from expanding.","That freeze has thawed in recent years partly because Congress eased some post-crisis constraints in 2018, and partly because Trump-appointed Fed officials have sped up approvals and been more flexible on compliance hurdles. The central bank’s approval period fell from an average of 297 days in 2015 to 135 during the first half of 2019, its data shows.","The value of M&A among commercial, savings and investment banks reached $54.66 billion by November, the highest since 2009, according to data from Dealogic.","While that bodes well for Morgan Stanley, the Wall Street giant’s size, complexity and push into retail banking poses heightened regulatory and political risk for the deal. Morgan Stanley is among the top five riskiest banks in the United States by some key measures, including short-term wholesale funding needs and leverage, according to U.S. Treasury’s Office of Financial Research.","E*Trade also ranks in the top 20 financial firms in the United States measured by leverage, according to the Treasury’s research. That will likely spark calls from Democrats such as progressive firebrand and presidential candidate Senator Elizabeth Warren for the Fed to block the deal, said analysts.","“Any giant Wall Street bank buying a household name company is a tempting talking point for progressive Dem(ocrats),” said Capital Alpha Partners in a note on Thursday, adding though that the Fed is unlikely to bow to that pressure. “They will listen to but probably won’t be swayed by arguments against the deal.”"

(reut.rs/37b9508)","Analysts had expected a profit of 99 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.","The bank’s net revenue rose 27% to $10.9 billion. It set new records for annual profit and revenue, and met or exceeded full-year performance targets Gorman laid out last January.","Since taking over a decade ago, the 61-year-old CEO has transformed Morgan Stanley from a Wall Street firm heavily weighted in money-losing trading businesses into a more balanced bank. He was the driving force behind Morgan Stanley’s decision to acquire Smith Barney, and made wealth management the cornerstone of his plan to stabilize revenue.","Morgan Stanley's stock has risen about 79% during Gorman's tenure, while the S&P 500 Banks index .SPXBK and S&P 500 .SPX have nearly tripled.","During an analyst call on Thursday, Gorman described the first five years of his tenure as a clean-up period after the financial crisis, and the second five as a time when he focused on growing businesses without sacrificing profitability.","Gorman noted that Morgan Stanley’s wealth business now generates about three times as much daily revenue as it did five years ago, and its securities business has snatched market share from rivals at a time when industry revenue has shrunk.","(For a graphic on Morgan Stanley's institutional securites revenue, click here: tmsnrt.rs/2TrH94a)",‘TRANSFORMED’ BUSINESS,"“We have meaningfully and with intent transformed this business into what it is today,” he said. “As we execute on the next phase of the firm’s journey, the objectives listed here, assuming a normal market environment, should result as a natural consequence.”","Over the next two years, Gorman wants Morgan Stanley to hit an efficiency ratio of 70-72%. Over the long-term, he is hoping the bank can get to 70% or less.","That metric, which measures costs relative to revenue, is watched closely by investors as a symbol of whether a company spends wisely. Morgan Stanley met its prior goal of 73% or less in 2019.","Keeping costs under control will help the bank reach another metric Gorman set for returns on equity (ROE), which shows how profitably a bank uses shareholder funds.","Morgan Stanley now aims to produce ROE of 13-15% through 2022, and 15-17% after that. Its 11.7% ROE last year was within Gorman’s prior targeted range of 10-13%.","Finally, he now wants the wealth unit to generate a pre-tax profit margin of 28-30% over the next two years, and 30% or more after that. The business’s 27.2% margin last year was comfortably within the prior goal of 26-28%.","On the call, some analysts probed the assumptions behind those figures, asking what might happen if markets collapse. On the other hand, Wells Fargo’s Mike Mayo - who has repeatedly pressed management to raise targets - asked why they should not be higher.","Gorman recalled a time when analysts were skeptical that Morgan Stanley could achieve much lower goals he had set, when its ROE was just 2-4% and its wealth margins were only 10%. He compared them to children in the back of a car asking, “When are we going to get there?”","“What I’ve always tried to do with these targets is set a range where the bottom of the range is what we should be able to deliver in all normal circumstances,” he said. “The top of the range is obviously a little more sporty.”","Morgan Stanley is the last of the major U.S. banks to report results this week, with JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, Citigroup Inc C.N and Bank of America Corp BAC.N posting similar trends in their Wall Street businesses.","However, its performance came in a stark contrast to its closest rival, Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N, which reported a profit decline on Thursday. Goldman is now in the middle of its own strategic turnaround, expanding into areas like consumer banking and corporate cash management to make profits less volatile."

Warburg Pincus and ESR also declined to comment.","Banks worldwide jostle fiercely for top billing on IPOs, decided by which ones are listed at the top and which are listed first, or to the left, of each category. Position matters for publicity as well as league-table credit - and is usually reflected in the fees each bank will take.","Although Morgan Stanley had no role in the first IPO attempt, it has usurped its rivals and is now leading the relaunched offering as the so-called ‘lead left’ JGC.","“It’s very rare to see a bank not working on a deal at first get a senior role as JGC (joint global coordinator) - not to mention in ESR’s case, the new bank is actually leading the relaunched deal,” said one senior equity capital banker not involved in this transaction.","The top-ranked banks in a Hong Kong IPO are known as sponsors, who carry legal liability for the accuracy of the prospectus. Under them are joint global coordinators. The bottom rung are joint bookrunners (JBRs), who collect orders from would-be investors but do not usually play a bigger role.","“It’s certainly not common in the Hong Kong IPO market,” said one source involved in the transaction. “Several existing banks couldn’t sell the deal as well as the issuer and its main backer expected, due to the high target valuation last time.”","The June deal was led by Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE and CLSA as the lead sponsors with Citigroup C.N, Credit Suisse CSGN.S, DBS DBSM.SI and Goldman Sachs GS.N listed as joint global coordinators.","This time however Morgan Stanley is leading investor meetings for the deal in London on Wednesday, continuing a roadshow which has already taken in Singapore and Hong Kong and will head to New York on Thursday.",Only Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank analysts are producing research on the deal - typically also a sign of which banks are leading the transaction.,"Both Deutsche Bank and CLSA retain their official roles as sponsors because changing sponsors would have involved restarting the entire IPO application process, said two sources.","While Deutsche Bank is also still listed as a JGC, CLSA has been dropped to a bookrunner role.","ESR Cayman made the decision to pull its deal in June on the day it was due to price, citing “market conditions”. Sources at the time told Reuters that the company had targeted a relatively aggressive valuation that had made the deal a hard sell in volatile markets.

That business has been a stabilizing force for Morgan Stanley during volatile times.,"The business is trying to add new clients in Asia and lend to them more, Gorman said. Morgan Stanley’s loan book grew 8% rise in the third quarter, but net interest income stayed flat due to declining rates.","In investment management, its smallest business, Morgan Stanley reported a 17% rise in revenue, to $764 million.","Gorman complimented Morgan Stanley’s trading and investment banking businesses for being resilient in a shaky quarter, and said management is focused on keeping the bank stable and prosperous over the long term.","“There remains tremendous upside here,” he said."

By providing wealth services to companies, they hope to start relationships with young workers that could develop into one-on-one wealth management relationships later.","The investments Morgan Stanley and Bank of America are making in workplace benefits services reflect the global banking industry’s shift toward steadier, fee-driven businesses to offset a secular decline in trading revenue since the 2007-2009 financial crisis.","However, the business has become more competitive in recent years. Fidelity, Vanguard and TIAA are consistently ranked as the top three employee-benefits providers, and Charles Schwab Corp SCHW.N and E*Trade Financial Corp ETFC.O have substantial stock plan businesses.","Companies only consider changing financial institutions about once a decade, and retirement products are fairly standardized, leaving little incentive to switch.","Combined with a push to reduce investor fees and the hefty expense of operating an employee-benefits operation at scale, it could be hard for Morgan Stanley and Bank of America to succeed, analysts said.","“This is a very fee-sensitive industry,” said Anastasia Krymkowski, an associate director at research firm Cerulli Associates specializing in retirement. “It’s an even bigger deal in 401(k) plan management because you have this idea of being a good fiduciary.”","Nonetheless, executives at the two banks told Reuters in separate interviews that they see opportunity to grow revenues and gain clients through these businesses.","Bank of America believes it can pick up clients left behind by JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N and Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N, which both quit the 401(k) business in recent years.","And Morgan Stanley bought the most popular software platform for employee stock plans, making it difficult for rivals to compete.","Morgan Stanley has added 200 new corporate clients since the acquisition and estimates that, overall, employees on Shareworks’ platform have $1.5 trillion in other accounts.","Executives predict that, over the next decade, they can turn hundreds of thousands of employees into customers of the firm’s robo-adviser or its full-service brokerage.","“It creates value for the employer, the employee and creates a new source of potential clients for us,” said Jed Finn, chief operating officer of Morgan Stanley’s wealth unit.",Analysts said revenues earned from Shareworks will be minimal in the near-term but later could create substantial business.,"Bank of America’s strategy to market a full suite of employee benefit products, including 401(k)s, equity compensation plans and health savings accounts, to existing clients in other parts of the bank also makes it money now.","Bank of America added nearly 3,000 corporate clients to its institutional retirement business in 2018, up about 50% from the prior year. So far this year, it has added another 2,190 of them. That includes 401(k)s, HSAs, employee stock and defined benefit plans.","“The vast amount of wins come from existing clients,” said Alastair Borthwick, Bank of America’s global head of commercial banking.","Still, only about 10% of Bank of America’s corporate clients use its retirement services, presenting the bank with an opportunity, Borthwick said. The institutional retirement business is hiring more retirement specialists to help pitch these products.","“Getting a company to turn on a 401(k) or a stock plan administration takes time,” said Glenn Schorr, analyst at Evercore ISI. “The good news is that they already have relationships with their target market customer and now it is up to them to convince them.”"

Birkey declined to comment on the lawsuit.","Neil Shapiro, a spokesman for Stifel, said the company does not comment on pending litigation.",Morgan Stanley’s lawsuit said the brokers each signed an agreement not to solicit the company’s clients for one year after leaving the firm for any reason. It asked the court to order the brokers to stop soliciting clients or using any of Morgan Stanley’s information.,"The complaint said the brokers also may be making false statements about their former employer. Some clients have been asking Morgan Stanley if its Bourbonnais office is closing or if Morgan Stanley is going bankrupt, the complaint said.","Files for one large client also appear to be missing, the complaint said.","Lawsuits over broker defections had dropped after major Wall Street firms signed a pact in 2004 agreeing not to sue if brokers left for rival firms and took clients with them. Morgan Stanley left the so-called Protocol for Broker Recruiting last October, saying the move would allow it to invest more in its advisers."

A failure to meet the requirement would normally result in an outright failure.,"The tests, set up to prevent a repeat of the 2007-2009 financial crisis, have become “increasingly more demanding” each year, and are now more severe than what the banks experienced during the crisis itself, Chief Executive Officer James Gorman said on a conference call with analysts.","“Ten years on, it’s time to take a fresh look,” he said. “We don’t want to be chasing in the last crisis, we’re trying to figure out the next one.”","Officials Gorman has spoken with at the Fed have sympathy with his argument that rules about banks’ capital ratios should be reexamined, he said.","Appearing before Congress on Tuesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell was questioned extensively on the central bank’s approach to this year’s stress tests, with Democrats criticizing the Fed for passing Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc even though their capital levels fell below the minimum required.","Powell told lawmakers that there had been no “haggling” or negotiations with Morgan Stanley over its stress tests results and capital plan, and added that the Fed was committed to the stress testing process. “It’s a very important thing for us and we’ll make sure to keep it stringent.”",The Fed purposefully increased the stringency of the stress test this year because firms are more likely to take on greater risk as the broader economic environment improves.,Gorman said that he does not expect Morgan Stanley will need to cut its capital distribution program going forward as a result of the tests.,"The 60-year-old CEO has restored Morgan Stanley to health since taking over in 2010, when the bank was still reeling from the financial crisis.

He became CEO in 2010, as the bank was still reeling from the financial crisis.","His tenure has been defined by reducing risk, exiting problematic businesses and emphasizing steadier ones that can generate reliable revenue.","During the call, Gorman made frequent references to how far Morgan Stanley has come since he took the helm, calling it a “different planet now.”","He noted that when he joined, the bank’s wealth business generated $1.25 million in quarterly revenue, a tiny fraction of the $4.4 billion it printed last quarter.","Overall, Morgan Stanley had been generating returns-on-equity of just 2 percent or so, compared with the annualized return of 14.9 percent last quarter.","That means it is well above the 10 percent minimum investors generally like to see, above the 10 percent to 13 percent target range Gorman set a few months ago, and close to Goldman Sachs, which reported a 15.4 percent return-on-equity in the first quarter.","Asked by analysts whether the target should be raised, Gorman said it would be “silly” to change so quickly, but that he would re-evaluate if Morgan Stanley generates returns above that range through the rest of the year.","“Philosophically, the target range is supposed to represent a normal set of outcomes under kind of tough market environment and a good market environment,” he said. “This was a very good market environment.”"

283,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-morgan-stanley-results-breakingviews/breakingviews-morgan-stanley-hands-investors-volatility-challenge-idUSKBN1HP1S1,2018-04-18T12:50:56Z,Breakingviews - Morgan Stanley hands investors volatility challenge,"NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Morgan Stanley is lumping its shareholders with a volatility challenge. In the first quarter the $94 billion Wall Street firm defended key turf against a surge from rivals and more than doubled fixed-income trading revenue from the last three months of 2017. That – and tax cuts – helped generate its best results in years, handily beating Chief Executive James Gorman’s admittedly underwhelming targets. The dilemma for investors is whether that merits a higher valuation.","The bank’s most recent earnings back up the notion that the overhaul Gorman instituted in 2015 is working. The fixed-income trading unit’s $1.9 billion top line, compared with $800 million in a slow fourth quarter, shows it does have “significant potential upside,” as Gorman put it in January, when volatility picks up.","Retaining its four-year-long ranking as the biggest equity trader was important, too. Morgan Stanley could only manage half the 70 percent or so growth since December racked up by closest rivals Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan. But with $2.6 billion in revenue, Gorman’s bank remains comfortably ahead – and just pipped Goldman to stay top of the equity underwriting heap.","That, along with a wealth-management arm that cranked out a respectable 26.5 percent pre-tax margin, contributed to a 14.9 percent annualized return on equity for the first quarter. That’s only just behind Goldman and JPMorgan and handily bests Gorman’s self-imposed goal of a 10 percent to 13 percent rate of return.","It presents shareholders with another quandary. They are already struggling to decide which of Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs to ascribe a higher multiple to: both trade just shy of 1.4 times current book value. On last quarter’s showing alone, both might warrant an upgrade to the just over 1.6 times that JPMorgan sports.","Trouble is, glimmers of improvements in industry-wide trading revenue – especially in fixed income, currency and commodities – have proven illusory in the past. Tax cuts, economic growth, diverging central bank policies around the world and growing instability in international political relations could all contribute to volatility being here to stay. Shareholders who have been burned before know to tread cautiously."
