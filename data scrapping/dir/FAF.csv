The company’s stock price fell 6.3% on the next trading day.","In a statement on Wednesday, First American said it “strongly disagrees” with the charges.","The Santa Ana, California-based company said its own probe found only a “very limited number” of consumers, none from New York, had personal information accessed without permission, and otherwise found no evidence of misuse.","“We intend to vigorously defend ourselves against the department’s unreasonable charges,” it said.","The financial services department said First American’s own review found more than 350,000 documents had been accessed improperly from June 2018 to May 2019 by automated “bots” or “scraper” programs.","First American was charged with violating six provisions of the department’s cybersecurity regulation, which took effect in March 2017.","It requires that banks and insurers licensed to operate in New York have “robust” cybersecurity programs, and monitor them regularly.",A hearing is scheduled for Oct. 26.
