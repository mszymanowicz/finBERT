The company is contesting that finding.","A week after Barr was nominated for the job of attorney general, Justice officials in Washington told the investigative team in the active criminal probe of Caterpillar to take “no further action” in the case, according to an email written by one of the agents and reviewed by Reuters.","The decision, the email said, came from the Justice Department’s Tax Division and the office of the deputy attorney general, who was then Rod Rosenstein.","“I was instructed on December 13, 2018,” wrote the agent, Jason LeBeau, “that the Tax Division and the Office of the Deputy Attorney General jointly came to the decision that no further action was to be taken on the matter until further notice.” LeBeau, an inspector general agent at the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, declined interview requests from Reuters.","Since then, a source close to the case says, the investigation has “stalled.” The order to freeze the Caterpillar investigation has not been previously reported.","Reuters was unable to determine why Justice issued the “no further action” directive. It was not issued by Barr, as it came before he was confirmed. A Justice Department spokesperson said Barr recused himself from any Caterpillar discussions once he became attorney general, but declined further comment. Barr, in testimony during his confirmation hearings, said rules of legal privilege precluded him from discussing his work for the company.","Rosenstein, who left the government in May 2019, did not respond to a phone message and emails seeking comment. The IRS declined to comment about the case.","Caterpillar, for its part, has reported to investors that the grand jury investigation is ongoing. The company told Reuters the DOJ’s Tax Division is reviewing the investigation. Caterpillar has said for years that it did nothing wrong.","Potential conflicts of interest, whether real or apparent, often arise when high-powered lawyers switch between private practice and government service. Bruce A. Green, a former federal prosecutor who teaches at Fordham Law School, said it is not unheard of for attorney generals to have clients who had business before the DOJ. He noted that in 2009, President Barack Obama’s attorney general, Eric Holder, recused himself from a case involving Swiss Bank UBS, a prior client.",But Green said he could not recall a case where agents were told to take no further action on a matter involving an incoming attorney general’s former client without some kind of explanation. “Why would you just stop?” he asked.,"A source familiar with the progress of the investigation, which is being conducted out of the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Central District of Illinois, said that since December 2018, “it’s slowed, it’s stalled, it’s languishing. Not a lot of action is being taken.” But the source stressed the probe is not technically closed, and couldn’t be called “dead.”","The government’s questions about Caterpillar’s tax structure started with a whistleblower lawsuit in 2009 that laid out what it said was a complex “tax dodge” to route Caterpillar profits on parts sales through a company in Switzerland. Then, in 2014, the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations dug into the issue, and alleged the company adopted a sales strategy that “shifted billions of dollars in profits away from the United States and into Switzerland, where Caterpillar had negotiated an effective corporate tax rate of 4% to 6%.” The Senate investigators quoted company insiders who said the system was structured for “tax avoidance.”","At the time, Caterpillar said the transactions, and tax strategy, were entirely legal. A Caterpillar vice president testified to the committee that having an offshore subsidiary collect profits and pay taxes was “nothing more than the standard business operations and tax planning that any prudent multinational enterprise would employ.”","The next year, a federal grand jury in Illinois launched a criminal investigation. In March 2017, federal agents raided three Caterpillar offices, wheeling out evidence in large black plastic boxes. In a report written for the government, a consultant for the investigators, Leslie Robinson, called the tax strategy “fraudulent rather than negligent.”","Two weeks after the raid, Caterpillar Chief Executive Jim Umpleby announced the hiring of Barr as company counsel. Barr would “take a fresh look at Caterpillar’s disputes with the government, get all the facts, and then help us bring these matters to proper resolution based on the merits.”","Robinson, the investigative consultant who had questioned Caterpillar’s tactics, told Reuters she met with Barr in May 2017, briefing him on why she thought the tax strategy was illegal, and to hear why the company thought it was not. Robinson said she would not discuss the meeting details or the basis for her conclusion in the government’s report.","In November 2018, as the White House scanned potential lawyers to take the job of attorney general, Barr’s name was among those floated. On December 7, the White House announced his selection. “He was my first choice from day one,” Trump said. Barr has emerged as one of Trump’s most aggressive aides, most recently authorizing federal prosecutors to investigate the counting of votes in this month’s presidential election, which Trump lost to Democrat Joe Biden.","In January 2019, Robinson, a professor at Dartmouth College’s Tuck School of Business, sent a note to FDIC agent LeBeau asking if the case was “dead or progressing.” Robinson wrote, “From a personal standpoint, it is a bit peculiar to have spent so much of my time and energy on something and then to have no idea if it will amount to anything concrete.”","“Quite frankly I am somewhat in the dark as well,” LeBeau replied. He said he had understood that a new U.S. attorney was in discussions with Caterpillar, but knew little more. “I know the process is going incredibly slow.”","This October, Robinson communicated again with the investigators. In emails reviewed by Reuters, she asked what had happened to the case, explaining that a Reuters reporter had inquired. That’s when LeBeau explained, copying other agents and a prosecutor on the email, that they had been told to take no further action a week after Barr’s nomination 20 months ago.","“We were given no additional explanation,” he wrote."

The company stepped up investments in such technologies as it emerged in 2017 from the longest downturn in its history, as part of a plan to increase recurring revenue from lucrative sales of services.","But it’s early days, and such tech remains a niche part of Caterpillar’s operations. Though it does not break out the revenue from technology sales, the rising demand is unlikely to make a major impact anytime soon on the group’s revenue, which stood at about $54 billion last year.","It is also a costly endeavor with the company pumping billions into R&D as a whole. Yet it is not clear if demand for autonomous and remote tech will hold up in a post-pandemic world while, in the longer term, there is the risk that a technology-driven improvement in productivity could drive down sales of new equipment.",‘IT HAS GOT CRAZIER’,"Nonetheless, autonomous technology is helping Caterpillar win equipment deals from customers that were previously not buying a lot of its machines.","Last year, Rio Tinto RIO.L signed up the company to supply self-driving trucks, autonomous blast drills, loaders and other machines for the construction of the Koodaideri iron ore mine in Australia, which is expected to be operational next year.",Rio Tinto declined to comment on the equipment deal.,"The mining industry has already adopted some technologies for self-driving trucks and remote operation of load-haul-dump machines. However the suspension in activities worldwide following government-mandated lockdowns at the peak of COVID-19, as well as recent outbreaks of infections at coal mines in Poland, have accelerated the deployment of those technologies.","Anthony Cook, general manager for autonomous haulage systems at Caterpillar’s rival Komatsu, said a lot of customers had brought forward their spending plans following the pandemic in a bid to take drivers out of mining trucks.","He said the COVID-19 crisis had not hit the fortunes of his autonomous business: “If anything, it has got crazier.”",Caterpillar and Komatsu hold the lion’s share of the global autonomous haulage system market worldwide.,"But Illinois-based Caterpillar has a competitive advantage, according to some analysts, as its technology can be retrofitted onto competitors’ equipment, making it a better fit for mixed fleets. Komatsu’s technology currently only works with its own machines.","Komatsu’s Cook said that while retrofitting offered a short-term solution, his company was developing technology to allow different brands of equipment to operate together “safely and efficiently”, which he added would offer long-term benefits.","But Jim Hawkins, general manager at Caterpillar’s resource industries division, said the ability to retrofit had helped drive up sales, because mining companies can buy the hardware and software to make machines operate autonomously without paying the much larger cost of overhauling their whole fleet.",That is a selling point at a time when miners are grappling with the virus-induced business uncertainty.,"Caterpillar sells autonomous operation technology separately from its machines. While retrofitting existing fleets has been the biggest driver for growth until now, Hawkins says an increasing number of customers are now ordering autonomous-ready mining trucks.","The company charges mining customers a hardware fee, a software fee and recurring licensing fee. In all, the technology could cost from $50 million to hundreds of millions of dollars, depending upon the size of the fleet and the duration of the contract, Hawkins said.","All these applications are part of the company’s endeavor to increases services revenue, which tends to be more resilient and profitable than equipment sales. It aims to increase services sales to $28 billion by 2026 from $18 billion in 2019.","Rob Wertheimer, machinery analyst at Melius Research, said the need for mining companies to replace an aging mining fleet and their growing demand for autonomous upgrades should help Caterpillar, with its tech giving it a “differential” advantage over rivals.","“Strategically, they are in a better place,” he added."

The UAW blocked the automakers’ plans to restart their factories on May 4.","The union this week signaled its members are ready to go back to work at General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV’s U.S. factories on May 18.","By contrast, the UAW supported Deere’s decision to resume production at two of its facilities within days of employees testing positive for the virus.",Union officials attribute that decision to a safety policy they negotiated with the company that mandates a strict implementation of guidelines prescribed by the nation’s health protection agency and the World Health Organization.,"“One of our priorities on the health and safety issue is to make sure that our members can self-report without any kind of penalty,” said Brian Rothenberg, the UAW’s public relations director. The union is negotiating with all its employers for similar benefits in order to reduce the risk of infection in the workplace.","But it was a provision for expanded benefits that sealed the deal, UAW officials say.","Deere declined to comment officially, citing the quiet period ahead of its earnings report later this month.","Under its agreement with the UAW, Deere is providing paid sick leave to cover the recommended 14 days of self-quarantine, even to workers who think they have been exposed to the virus but are not certain and have not been tested.","“The last thing we wanted was for individuals to feel compelled to come to work to get paid,” a Deere official said.","The Moline, Illinois-based company altered shift schedules to ensure employees from one shift exit before the next shift reports to work. It hired an industrial-hygiene company to audit the sanitization work at some of its larger units.","Additionally, the farm equipment maker enhanced pay provisions to cover the challenges workers face due to day care and school closings. It also waived copays, coinsurance and deductibles for its employees for coronavirus testing.","At Caterpillar, the UAW and the United Steelworkers have negotiated a similar paid sick leave policy for their members.",The heavy equipment maker is offering workers paid sick leave up to 2 weeks if they have been instructed to self-quarantine. The benefit also can be used for taking care of immediate family members.,Production employees are allowed time off up to 10 weeks at 2/3 of their salary for child care.,"Caterpillar spokeswoman Kate Kenny said the benefits are available to all employees, not just union members.","Workers are required to go for temperature checks before entering the facility. To ensure social distancing, lunch hours have been extended and visitor access to facilities has been limited.","It has not been smooth sailing for the two equipment manufacturers. Factories are hobbled by supply shortages, weakened demand and increased absenteeism among workers.","Caterpillar’s retail sales dropped by 20% in North America in March. In response to the virus-induced business disruption, the company is temporarily shutting down facilities and imposed indefinite or temporary layoffs.",Chief Financial Officer Andrew Bonfield said Caterpillar is managing production by segment and adjusting its workforce by facility.,The situation at Deere is also uncertain.

(Reuters) - Orders for the mining machines and construction bulldozers made at this sprawling Caterpillar Inc. CAT.N factory in central Illinois have jumped, in general, three-fold over the past year.","But meeting that boom in demand at the world’s largest heavy equipment manufacturer is a challenge, in part because of Caterpillar suppliers like Steve Kirsh.","Years of watching Caterpillar and other big manufacturers cut inventories, close plants and axe workers in the last downturn has embedded caution in Kirsh’s ambition to expand after the surge in orders, reflecting a more fundamental shift in how many industrial businesses view expansions, according to interviews with Caterpillar executives, more than a half-dozen Caterpillar suppliers and U.S. economic data.","“I just wasn’t sure it was real,” said Kirsh, speaking from a windowless office at the front of Kirsh Foundry Inc., in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin, which makes metal parts for Caterpillar and other customers.","Even with a surplus in demand for its product, Caterpillar CEO Jim Umpleby told investors last month the company will not invest in factory capacity. Instead, it plans to spend more on new technologies, expanding its parts business and selling more rental and used equipment.","The company’s big East Peoria assembly plant runs just one shift and operates only four days a week, while its own parts-making facilities are running three shifts, five days a week to provide it enough components to assemble, according to the company officials. Outside suppliers are similarly scrambling to catch up to the surge in orders.","This has extended the lead-time to deliver final products to dealers. For instance, it takes more than eight months to get one model of its large engines into a customer’s hands.","The Trump administration’s efforts to rewrite trade relations with key partners, especially China, only add to the uncertainty. The latest move to step back from a confrontation with China is good news for many domestic producers, who worry that a trade war could quickly puncture the global expansion, going on nine years, which is feeding the U.S. factory boom, manufacturing executives told Reuters.","The result is a drag on the economic expansion that President Trump and Republicans hoped for coming off U.S. corporate tax reform last year. The idea behind Trump’s tax reform was that companies could pour more money into expansions, hire more workers and lift wages.","There has been an upswing in plans for capital spending, but much of it is concentrated in the technology and energy sectors. Spending plans by industrial companies are up only slightly. For a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs/2IBSzKF","For those companies that do want to expand, from car companies to railroads and engine makers, they often can’t find the workers to expand fast enough.","The contraction of their supply chain in the last downturn thrust many players big and small into a ""just in time delivery"" business model, creating order backlogs, which has led to soaring prices for raw materials in the recent upswing. For a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs/2rY3iZp","The hesitation to expand Caterpillar’s supply chain is rooted in the last bust, notable as the longest downturn in its history - worse than the Great Depression - from 2012 to 2016, when sales dropped more than 40 percent.","Chastised by that slump, the Deerfield, Ill.-based company embarked on a restructuring strategy that aims to squeeze more production from its factories and buy more of what it needs from outside suppliers on a just-in-time basis.","Caterpillar has closed or restructured more than 25 factories and its full-time workforce is smaller now than it was at the end of 2012. And cuts continue. Caterpillar plans to close two more facilities this year and is considering shuttering an engine plant, which would eliminate 880 jobs.",Caterpillar executives said the new strategy is boosting profitability by allowing it to get the best use out of its existing factories. They blame the backlogs on its suppliers’ inability to keep up with the surge in orders.,"Timing is part of the problem. Caterpillar and a host of other industrial companies all ramped up orders at the same time. “That switch got turned on after being turned off for several years - all at the same time,” said Amy Campbell, director of investor relations.","Campbell, however, said the supply situation is improving. The central Illinois plant will go back to the normal five-day shift beginning in June.","Caterpillar’s investors love this approach, since it helps deliver strong margins in the good times and minimizes pain in bad times.","The company recently boosted profit projections for 2018 by about 25 percent, and in the latest quarter, every segment posted better results compared to a year ago. But its stock price took a hit when the company’s CFO warned higher prices for raw materials like steel are going to start squeezing margins even as growth continues.","Supply chain bottlenecks, meanwhile, are hitting companies across the industrial heartland.","The Institute for Supply Management’s index for order backlogs, one of the best U.S. metrics for how quickly manufacturers are meeting demand, now stands at its highest level in 14 years. And many companies remain tight fisted. The Commerce Department recently reported that orders for capital goods, a key measure of business investment, fell in March, the third decline in four months. These numbers show that companies are holding back on spending, even as their order books swell.","“We’re in a period of significant disruption where everyone is scrambling — but it’s the way supply chains work today,” said John Layden, a consultant in Indianapolis who helps companies design and manage supply networks.",Finding employees is another drag on the U.S. manufacturing supply chain.,When Kirsh decided to add people early last year at his foundry - which melts iron and forms it into the rough shapes that will be refined for Caterpillar and others - he could not find them. Wisconsin’s jobless rate has hit an all-time low of 2.8 percent.,"So Kirsh tried something new, hiring a Minnesota staffing company that specializes in parachuting industrial workers into factories that can’t find them locally.","He eventually got about 10 of these workers, who he calls “mercenaries,” who helped get his backlog under control. One came from as far as away as Detroit. But it was a costly fix. Between paying the staffing company, hotels and a per diem for the workers, he estimates they cost about three times more than local labor.","Industrial companies have always struggled with big swings in demand, but the problem of shortages emerges much quicker in today’s super-lean economy.","In the past, manufacturers from Kirsh to Caterpillar often kept more goods on warehouse shelves, creating a built-in buffer that could be absorbed as signals went out to suppliers that the latest upturn is going to continue. That gave more time for everyone to gear up.","It is a luxury that does not exist anymore, said Joe Williams, president of privately-held Wolfe and Swickard Machine Company Inc. in Indianapolis, which buys forged parts from Kirsh and over 20 other foundries that his 85-worker shop shapes and polishes into final machine parts.","Early last year, Williams saw orders from Caterpillar surge 80 percent, a stunning increase that left him scrambling.","“When we get an order, we have to order from a foundry, which has to communicate with the people supplying them metal, so there’s always a lag,” he said.","This time, however, it was particularly difficult. Some foundries simply refused his business because they were swamped with orders from other customers.","Like Kirsh, Williams has had trouble hiring workers and said he still needs at least 15 more machinists. Caterpillar has told him to expect orders to go up another 20 percent this year.","Stephen Volkmann, a machinery industry analyst at Jefferies, said Caterpillar was slow to ramp up production - which frustrated dealers clamoring for machines they could sell.",But he said Caterpillar and its suppliers are smart to be cautious.,"“They all know that (business) could be down again next year,” he said, and so over expanding now “would be an expensive mistake.”",(GRAPHIC: Capex upswing - tmsnrt.rs/2KIXJoH),(GRAPHIC: Order backlog - tmsnrt.rs/2Lpdwdw)

Profits and revenues topped analysts’ estimates, while the world’s largest heavy equipment maker also upgraded its profit outlook for the full year 2018.","Yet investors grew concerned about management’s comments that first-quarter performance was the “high watermark” for the year. While Caterpillar expects earnings to be strong for the rest of 2018, the company cautioned it would not have the same pricing power to pass on increased material costs.","Caterpillar’s shares opened higher on Tuesday and gained as much as 4.6 percent in early trade, buoyed the earnings outlook. The euphoria, however, did not even last two hours.","As soon as the company’s Chief Financial Officer Bradley M. Halverson called the first quarter profits “the high watermark for the year”, the stock began giving up the gains. And when he started talking about the company’s price versus material costs equation for the later parts of the year, the sell-off became more pronounced.","Shares in Caterpillar, part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI, closed down 6.2 percent at $144.44 on the New York Stock Exchange. At one stage, the stock had lost 11 percent from the day's high.","“It’s a negative surprise because the indications had previously been that everything was okay on that front,” said Lawrence T. De Maria, co-group head of Global Industrial Infrastructure at William Blair & Company.","Caterpillar's slide exacerbated the fall in the broader market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI closed the day down 424.56 points, losing 1.74 percent from its close on Monday.","Tuesday’s sell-off coincided with a rise in 10-year Treasury yields which hit the highly anticipated 3 percent mark for the first time in four years, stoking concerns over higher borrowing rates for companies already facing rising costs.","President Donald Trump’s crackdown on steel imports has constrained supplies in the domestic market, inflating costs of the metal. Caterpillar said steel costs for the equipment industry were up about 15 percent in the March quarter.","To compensate, the company is carrying out price increases that would come into effect in the middle of the year.","Other companies also are relying on price increases to protect profit margins. Last week, Donaldson Company Inc DCI.N, which makes filters for heavy equipment makers, announced price increases of 4-15 percent, citing higher steel costs the company said were squeezing profit margins.",The Institute for Supply Management survey published this month showed a surge in the cost of raw materials and worries among manufacturers about the impact of Trump’s steel and aluminum import tariffs.,"The tariffs are pushing up steel prices at a time when inflation could be heating up, prompting the Federal Reserve to hike U.S. interest rates which could in turn slow economic growth and crimp domestic demand.","The Deerfield, Illinois-based company now expects full-year profit to range between $9.75 to $10.75 per share, $2 above its range in January.","Caterpillar, which serves as a bellwether for global economic activity, has benefited as the global economy has had its best run since 2011. With the International Monetary Fund predicting robust global growth for the next two years, demand for its equipment is expected to remain strong.","In the latest quarter, revenues rose 31 percent on year to $12.9 billion, above Wall Street’s expectations, as strong commodity prices and increased construction activities in North America and China drove up sales of mining and construction machines.",Overall sales were also boosted by favorable currency impacts and improved price realization.,"“The first quarter was an exceptional quarter for performance,” said Amy Campbell, head of investor relations at Caterpillar.","While she said the performance would not be repeated, the company still expected “strong” operating margins for the full-year. Caterpillar also said it expected sales volume to grow thanks to higher demand across all regions and most end markets.","Caterpillar’s 2018 forecast did not include potential impact from future geopolitical risks and increased trade restrictions. But in its annual report this year, the company warned that “buy national” policies or retaliation against such policies could hurt operations.",Threats of a global trade war pose the biggest risks for a company that sells more than half of its machines outside the United States.,"The company reported a net profit of $2.74 per share for the quarter, above analysts’ consensus forecast of $2.04 per share. Adjusted net profit was $2.82 per share."
