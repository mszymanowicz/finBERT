He argues that HP itself, a “vast but floundering company”, botched the acquisition.","Autonomy was a market leader in software for unstructured data, helping companies extract the meaning from emails, video or voice calls, which are hard to analyze in traditional ways.","And Leo Apotheker, architect of the deal and HP’s CEO between November 2010 and September 2011, had sought to boost HP’s languishing profitability by integrating its legacy computer and printer business with higher-margin software.",But the former CEO of Europe’s leading business software group SAP resisted suggestions from Lynch’s defense lawyer in London’s High Court that the acquisition of Autonomy was central to a desperate strategy.,"“Unstructured data was at the center of your plans,” Robert Miles QC, acting for Lynch, told Apotheker, who was called as a witness in the case.","“No, that’s not right, it was part of the plan,” Apotheker said, adding that HP had considered buying either Autonomy or German group Software AG in the first half of 2011, but decided on the British firm because it would provide the “technological uplift” that HP wanted.","It was not clear cut, Apotheker said:","“Looking at financial markets, investors, I think they would have preferred Software AG,” he said.","Apotheker who said in his witness statement that he had “never told the due diligence team to prioritize due diligence of Autonomy’s technology over its financials”, also rejected the idea that HP was in crisis.",“But it wasn’t doing well. I was very unhappy with the results but that doesn’t mean the company was about to go under.”,"HP is suing Lynch, once hailed as Britain’s answer to Bill Gates, along with his former finance chief Sushovan Hussain for more than $5 billion. Lynch also faces criminal fraud charges in the United States, which carry a maximum term of 20 years. Hussain has been convicted of fraud in a related U.S. case.","At the opening of the case last week, HP’s lawyer Laurence Rabinowitz QC said the U.S. company believed it was buying a fast-growing software firm with no hardware business.","Apotheker recalled that Lynch told him Autonomy was a “very focused” pure software company when they first met in Palo Alton, California, in April 2011.",He said he understood that to mean Autonomy’s strategy was driven by “software and software only”.,"HP argues that covertly selling hardware was one of the ways that Autonomy inflated its revenue, while Lynch’s lawyers have said it was commercially justified.","Apotheker was replaced by Meg Whitman, who planned to refocus the company on its core hardware strengths after an outcry from shareholders over the new strategy and a steep decline in HP’s share price.",Hewlett Packard Company in 2015 split into two separate publicly traded companies - HP Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise.,"Whitman is expected to be called as a witness later in the trial, while Lynch himself is expected to appear around July.",The case is expected to last until the end of the year.

Hussain also denies any wrongdoing.,"HP wrote down the value of Autonomy by $8.8 billion, saying it had uncovered serious accounting improprieties. HP is suing Lynch and Hussain for $5 billion of that amount making the case Britain’s biggest-ever fraud trial.","HP’s lawyers told the court when the case opened this week that Autonomy had inflated its true value through a series of fraudulent transactions, such as selling hardware at a loss and so-called round-trip deals - a type of barter with no real commercial rationale - masterminded by Lynch.","In his opening argument for Lynch’s defense, Robert Miles QC said HP had only discovered a small number of historical deals which were said to have some or other wrongful feature, despite spending several years and huge sums of money on its search.","“All the deals now attacked were real commercial deals with real counterparties. The suggestion that Dr Lynch was in the business of conning HP is unreal,” he told London’s High Court.","“HP, on the other hand, was a vast but floundering company.”","Lynch also faces criminal fraud charges in the United States, which carry a maximum term of 20 years. Hussain has been convicted of fraud in a U.S. case related to the deal.","A year after acquiring Autonomy, HP threw out Chief Executive Leo Apotheker, the architect of the deal which was supposed to transform the computer and printer maker, one of Silicon Valley’s original companies, into a more profitable group centered on business software and services.","Apotheker was replaced by Meg Whitman, who planned to refocus the company on its core hardware strengths after an outcry from shareholders over the new strategy and a steep decline in HP’s share price.","“Autonomy was left as HP’s unwanted stepchild,” said Miles.",Both Apotheker and Whitman are expected to appear as witnesses in the London trial.,"As the case opened on Monday, HP’s lawyer Laurence Rabinowitz QC said the U.S. company had been led to believe it was buying a fast-growing, pure software company.",He told the court that Lynch and Hussain had knowingly been involved in “widespread and systematic false accounting” to create a materially false picture of Autonomy’s finances.,"Autonomy had engaged in “revenue-pumping” by encouraging customers to buy its products in exchange for buying goods from them that it did not need, restructuring deals to produce upfront license fees, and covertly selling pure hardware not even programmed with its software at a loss, Rabinowitz said.","Lynch’s lawyer told the court that it was absurd to think the 53-year-old was making detailed, day-to-day accounting decisions. Rather he relied on a finance department overseen by an audit committee and the company’s auditors, Miles said.",Miles also said it was impossible to understand why Lynch would have taken an executive position at HP after the deal if he really had committed a huge fraud with the U.S. company as its victim.,"“The case that we’re now hearing being advanced entails that Dr Lynch must have been monumentally dim and, as you’ll see, there’s no chance that he is,” Miles said.",Lynch attended the court session but is not expected to be questioned until around July.,"Miles also told the court that the $5 billion figure for which Lynch and Hussain are being sued was not based on HP’s own commissioned audits, which had not found a basis for writing down Autonomy in the months after the acquisition.",Hewlett Packard Company in 2015 split into two separate publicly traded companies - HP Inc. and Hewlett Packard Enterprise.,The case is expected to last until the end of the year.

Hussain misled the market, the company said.","“That Mr. Hussain attempted to depict the fraud as nothing more than a misunderstanding of international accounting rules was, and still remains, patently ridiculous,” the company said.","HPE last year completed the spin-off of much of its software business, closing the door on the Autonomy deal. HPE was formed when the company once known as Hewlett-Packard split into HPE and HP Inc in November 2015."
