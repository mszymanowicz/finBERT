Heineken has wanted for years to terminate its distribution contract with Femsa in order to build out a distribution network it acquired from Kirin Holdings Co Ltd in 2017.","“The redesign of the distribution agreement between the Coca-Cola system and Heineken in Brazil is an important milestone,” said John Santa Maria Otazua, chief executive officer of Coca-Cola Femsa.","According to the terms of the deal, Heineken will begin to distribute its eponymous Heineken and Amstel beer brands via its in-house distribution channels, while the Femsa network will continue distributing the Kaiser, Bavaria and Sol brands.",The financial terms of the deal were not revealed.

A year earlier, Femsa logged net profit of 5.64 billion pesos.","Revenues for Femsa’s gas stations fell 49%, as stay-at-home measures reduced mobility. Oxxo sales declined 8%, hit by a nearly 25% drop in store traffic driven by lockdown measures as well as “significant” beer shortages, the company said.","In a call with analysts, investor relations director Juan Fonseca said Femsa was evaluating which low-traffic Oxxo stores to close. The company in the second quarter shuttered 24 locations permanently and another 260 temporarily, leaving it with 19,558 operating stores.","Even so, Fonseca said plans were underway to open Oxxo stores in Brazil at the end of the year, without specifying how many.","The only Femsa business that grew was its pharmacy unit, with a 2.5% revenue increase, due to sustained demand.",Chief Executive Eduardo Padilla described the quarter as “challenging” and said the outlook was still uncertain.,"“We are seeing a very tentative recovery that will probably take a long time,” he said in a statement accompanying results."
