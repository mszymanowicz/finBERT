The U.S. aircraft maker may join customers like United Airlines in getting taxpayer help to overcome the Covid-19 fallout. U.S. President Donald Trump said as much on Tuesday – a day after Standard & Poor’s downgraded the company’s credit rating. The coronavirus-related hits have compounded the problems Boeing already had with its grounded 737 MAX jet, leading its shares to plummet more than 60% so far this year.","Its European rival has suffered too, of late, as virus fears halved its market value. But Airbus now has an advantage: It’s hard for aircraft producers to ramp up production quickly. So if airlines buy fewer planes, Airbus will not be so stretched, which may make it easier for customers to switch from Boeing. No wonder, perhaps, that the worse damage to Boeing’s stock has taken its market value closer to Airbus than in a long time. (By Richard Beales)","WOULD YOU CREDIT IT? Some companies are being “relatively irrational” in drawing down bank credit lines. So said Société Générale Chief Executive Frederic Oudea on Tuesday. The French lender was one of several firms that had to hand over their share of a $9 billion credit facility that Anheuser Busch InBev decided to draw in full, according to the Financial Times. But the move is entirely logical for the beer company. The brewer of Budweiser and the now unfortunately named Corona faces lower sales as cities and entire countries ask citizens to stay away from bars and the like. Ensuring it has enough cash makes sense.","The same applies to hotels, airlines and other industries hit by Covid-19. But it’s hard to blame executives in more resilient sectors if they decide to load up on cash, too. They need to be as ready as possible for everything from a sharp rise in employee sickness to banks having too few people in seats to process payments. That might seem unlikely, but right now it doesn’t feel irrational. (By Antony Currie)","SOCIAL DISTANCING SPEEDS RETAIL SHAKEOUT. Amazon.com wants to hire 100,000 warehouse and delivery workers in the United States to keep up with e-commerce orders that are increasing thanks to Covid-19. Grocery chain Costco Wholesale, whose shares are up 8% over the past five days, has pulled off a rare feat for a country in lockdown – a deal. On Tuesday it bought logistics company Innovel Solutions for $1 billion. That’s illustrative of the times: Innovel belonged to the operator of the troubled Sears department stores which have been in long-term decline.","Struggling retail chains like Sears will be in for darker times as they try to cope with the coronavirus. Gap, L Brands, Nordstrom and Macy’s are among those temporarily shutting their stores or reducing hours. That doesn’t bode well for the long term. All in, there could be more than 15,000 U.S. store closures this year, double the number in 2019, according to Coresight Research. That may yet spiral.

Meanwhile America’s Chamber of Commerce, a lobby group for big companies, has issued a laundry list of handout requests.

Central bank Governor Murat Uysal slashed the country’s main interest rate to 9.75% from 10.75% at an emergency meeting on Tuesday. Uysal is doing just what he was hired to do by President Tayyip Erdogan, who thinks tighter monetary policy causes inflation.","Unlike past cuts, this one actually makes sense, with central banks worldwide easing monetary policy to help contain the economic effects of Covid-19. Turkey’s heavy reliance on tourism, which accounts for 12% of GDP, is an acute concern. But Erdogan’s economic response needs to go much further than cheaper borrowing: tax breaks and government-mandated rent relief are probably required. With the budget deficit already expected to be 2.9% of GDP, the next step may be trickier. (By Dasha Afanasieva)","FLOUNDERING AMS RIGHTS ISSUE PUTS UBS AND HSBC IN THE FIRING LINE. The Austrian sensor maker’s 4.6 billion euro takeover of Germany’s Osram Licht has entered another circle of financial hell. With AMS shares trading at around 9 Swiss francs on Tuesday, below the 9.2 Swiss francs offer price for a 1.7 billion euro rights issue meant to pay for the deal, there’s every chance of the deal imploding.","That points to two outcomes. If underwriters UBS and HSBC stick to the script, AMS will get its cash. But the banks will then be 46% owners of the enlarged AMS. The alternative is the duo pulling the ripcord, citing market turmoil. Coronavirus certainly ticks that box. Less certain is how AMS would then repay the 4.4 billion euro bridging loan to Bank of America – and UBS and HSBC. (By Ed Cropley)","ITALIAN IPO SHOWS FLIP SIDE OF LOCKDOWN ECONOMY.

The Belgian brewer’s sale of its Australian business to Asahi for $11.3 billion will cut debt. The Japanese company is paying a lower valuation for the maker of Victoria Bitter than AB InBev wanted from an initial public offering of its Asia business, shelved last week, but probably higher than the multiple investors ascribed to the unit. It keeps the door open for boss Carlos Brito to try again.","The Asia-Pacific IPO was supposed to raise almost $10 billion, helping to solve another problem: The parent had net debt of $102 billion at the end of last year following its 2016 takeover of SABMiller. According to the Wall Street Journal, the brewer wanted to reduce that to $80 billion, a level that would enable it to continue pursuing acquisitions and capital investments without being downgraded below investment grade by credit-ratings firms.","Selling the unit, Carlton & United, will help. At 14.9 times 2018 EBITDA, the valuation paid by the Japanese is less than what AB InBev wanted for the entire Asia business, which was valued at 19.7 times at the low end of a punchy price range in the IPO. However, in attempting to do a sum-of-the-parts assessment, investors might have valued the business Down Under similar to mature-market brewers such as Japan’s Kirin and Sapporo, and Denmark’s Carlsberg, which trade at between 11 and 12 times.","True, Carlton & United’s sales grew by low single digits last year due to heightened competition and declining consumer confidence. But it’s still the number one brewer by volume in Australia, according to Euromonitor, and Asahi is unlikely to sell it back to the company, unlike when AB InBev sold its South Korean business to private equity in 2009 and re-acquired it later. That unit could be worth $8 billion if Brito wanted to repeat the trick to raise more funds.","Disposals, however, don’t provide a currency to do more deals. The upside is that, in its shrunken form, AB InBev’s Asia business will be more reliant on emerging markets like China, India and Vietnam, where peers trade at higher multiples. So if the brewer did re-attempt to list, it might be able to get what it wanted in the first place – a lofty multiple."

Sales of Budweiser, for example, are higher now in China than in the brand’s U.S. home market.","The 2016 purchase of nearest rival SABMiller, which pushed AB InBev’s net debt above $100 billion, has yielded profitable markets in Latin America, such as Colombia, but challenges in South Africa.",M&A DELAY,AB InBev itself described the Asian flotation less as a debt-reduction tool and more as a means to create a regional champion to drive local consolidation.,"The company did not mention would-be partners, but analysts believed the Asian business could have tied up with ThaiBev’s brewing business or San Miguel of the Philippines. Such partnerships are now less likely.","The slower deleveraging also delays AB InBev’s next major deal, which analysts believe could be the African brewing operations of Groupe Castel, controlled by French billionaire Pierre Castel.","AB InBev said on Friday it had cancelled the Asian listing due to factors including market conditions, though sources familiar with the deal have said it was the high valuation that deterred investors. AB InBev declined to comment further.","The company could work to make Asia even more attractive. Trevor Stirling, analyst at Bernstein Securities, suggested brewing Corona lager locally, rather than importing from Mexico, as one way to boost margins.","Otherwise, the implication is that, unless the brewer cuts its asking price - something it was unwilling to do last week - the Asian IPO is cancelled not postponed."

AB InBev shares ended trading in New York down 3%, as investors saw that prospect slipping away.","The canceled IPO is also a setback to the Hong Kong stock exchange, which hoped Budweiser’s listing would help attract other high-profile international companies at a time of increased trade tensions between the United States and China.",UK-based data center operator Global Switch and consumer lender Home Credit Group are among the international companies that have been eying Hong Kong IPOs.,"AB InBev said the decision was due to “several factors, including the prevailing market conditions,” despite the Hong Kong stock market being almost flat on Friday and trading close to its historic highs.",Sources close to the IPO said investors were unwilling to entertain AB InBev’s expectations for the Budweiser APAC business to trade at a valuation multiple above that of peers.,"Budweiser APAC, whose portfolio of more than 50 beer brands includes Stella Artois and Corona, was marketing its shares with an indicative range of HK$40-HK$47. While it received offers within that range from hedge funds and private wealth managers, some large long-only U.S. investors, which are often prioritized in an IPO, made offers below the HK$40 per share level, the sources said.","The indicative price range valued Budweiser at 15.5-18.2 times its enterprise value to its estimated 2020 cash flow, according to the sources. By comparison, AB InBev trades at 10.3 times its projected 12-month earnings, China-focused peer Tsingtao trades at 14.1 times, and Japan’s Kirin, another Asia-centric brewing giant, trades at 9.9 times, according to Refinitiv data.","Unlike U.S. bourses, the Hong Kong stock exchange also restricts companies’ ability to discount their IPOs. Limiting AB InBev’s options was its decision not to take advantage of a provision that would have given it leeway to lower Budweiser’s price range by 10%, as long as it flagged that as a risk in the IPO prospectus.","AB InBev had expected Budweiser’s IPO to eclipse Uber Technologies as the biggest IPO of the year. It ended up being the third-largest listing ever to be withdrawn, after Sociedad Estatal Loterias y Apuestas del Estado in 2011 and AIA Group in early 2010, according to Dealogic.","“It was the right thing to do. I’m glad they didn’t do this if the demand was soft,” Liberum analyst Nico von Stackelberg said of AB InBev’s decision.","AB InBev left the door open to revisit the IPO, saying it “will closely monitor market conditions.”","The canceled IPO is also a blow to the investment banks leading it, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley in the first six months of 2019 earned more fees from Asia Pacific IPOs than any other U.S. or European bank, according to Refinitiv league table data, while JPMorgan was ranked 31st.","Budweiser APAC was seeking to raise between $8.3 billion and $9.8 billion through the float, much of which was to go toward paying down debt at its highly leveraged parent.",AB InBev has been working to reduce a debt pile of more than $100 billion that it built up with the purchase of nearest rival SABMiller in late 2016.,"AB InBev cut its dividend for 2018. It has said it will reduce its net debt-to-EBITDA ratio to below 4.0 by the end of 2020 from 4.6 at the end of last year, saying it is not dependent on the Asian flotation. It puts the optimal ratio at 2.","The company had positioned its Hong Kong listing as creating a champion in Asia-Pacific, where sales are growing as increasingly wealthy consumers turn to premium beer brands.",The IPO was set to precede Alibaba’s plans to raise as much as $20 billion through a Hong Kong listing.,"Last month, logistics real estate developer ESR Cayman Ltd shelved its Hong Kong IPO of up to $1.24 billion “in light of the current market conditions.”"

The currency was seen at 7.7893 per dollar, up 0.1% on the day. It is pegged to the U.S. dollar at a tight range of 7.75 to 7.85.","On top of equity market demand, the strength of the local dollar reflects a massive unwinding of the carry trade, Hao Zhou, a forex analyst at Commerzbank in Singapore, wrote in a note on Thursday.","A previously wide spread between U.S. and Hong Kong rates led investors to borrow Hong Kong dollars cheaply to buy higher-yielding U.S. dollar assets in a ‘carry trade’, spurring capital outflows and pressure on the local currency.","But that gap by-and-large closed in June. The Hong Kong dollar rose 0.33% against the greenback that month, its largest monthly gains since September 2008.","Demand for cash had also surged in June as protesters clashed with police during a mass demonstration against legislation that would allow citizens to be extradited to China. Financial institutions rushed into liquid assets, with interbank interest rates in the city shooting up across the curve.","Traders said the interest rate spike this time, however, was driven mainly by the city’s mega IPO although demand for cash had also bolstered the local currency.","Earlier this week, unrest gripped the city again as hundreds of protesters in the former British colony stormed and ransacked the legislature after a demonstration marking the anniversary of Hong Kong’s return to Chinese rule.","Aninda Mitra, senior sovereign analyst at BNY Mellon Investment Management, said Hong Kong’s credentials as a financial hub will nevertheless stay intact, not least for its role as a key fundraising center for Chinese companies.","“In that context, I don’t think the underlying bedrock of Hong Kong’s status is at risk,” he told a media event in Hong Kong on Thursday. “Will geopolitics somehow destabilize that? It’s a very long shot.”"

The Belgian brewer is considering an initial public offering of part of the unit, Reuters reported on Friday. The region is a fast-growing jewel in AB InBev’s crown, but it faces stiff competition in China, and has struggled in India and Southeast Asia. That makes the mooted price tag tough to swallow.","The Budweiser brewer, having run up $100 billion in debt, needs to detox. A multibillion-dollar Hong Kong listing of its Asian operations would help ease the burden, while giving investors a slice of its fastest-growing business after Latin America. The company is the leading premium brewer in China, where consumers drink more Budweiser than those in the United States, according to Rabobank research. As of June 2018 the company boasted a stellar 35 percent EBITDA margin.","The unit is expected to earn $3 billion this year before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation, according to Bernstein. One third of that will come from developing markets like China and India, and the rest from mature markets like Australia and South Korea, the research outfit reckons. However, while AB InBev leads in China’s premium segment, it faces stiff competition from China Resources Beer, which took control of Heineken’s China business in August and aspires to become the premium market leader.","AB InBev also lags in Southeast Asia’s two most promising markets. In Thailand, Heineken is the clear market leader in the premium beer segment, with a roughly 4 percent share as of 2017, according to Euromonitor; AB InBev has yet to break into the top 10. Heineken also dominates in Vietnam, with a 22 percent share, versus AB InBev’s 0.5 percent. AB InBev owns roughly 20 percent of the Indian market, but that region poses challenges. Consumers there tend to drink in moderation, and prefer spirits to beer. Brewers are also grappling with a price-fixing probe.","This makes the roughly $70 billion valuation, reported by Bloomberg, hard to justify. The price is equivalent to 23 times expected 2018 EBITDA; CR Beer trades closer to 15 times. Those inclined to pay that much should take off the beer goggles."

Previously, the barley price was set each year but farmers found it difficult to plan production and mitigate risk. So in 2009, barley prices were tied to the price of wheat futures on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE).","As part of the merger approval, AB InBev has agreed to increase the amount of barley it buys in South Africa to 475,000 tonnes from the 415,000 it hopes to get in 2018.",The brewer said that meant the industry would have to increase production in drier regions and the new pricing formula rebalanced the competitive position of barley versus wheat in all growing regions.,"South African farmers are expected to have harvested about 300,000 tonnes of barley in 2017.
