Negligence this may be; but defamation of a public figure it plainly is not.”","But in Tuesday’s decision, Walker said Rakoff had improperly relied on testimony from Bennet, who wrote the editorial, at an unusual evidentiary hearing.","Bennet said he had not intended to blame Palin for the 2011 shooting, nor had he closely reviewed coverage at the Times and The Atlantic that showed no connection between her and Loughner, but was simply making a point about the political environment. Bennet had been the Atlantic’s editor-in-chief.","Walker said, however, Rakoff should have relied solely on legal papers when deciding whether Palin could establish actual malice, rather than let Bennet testify at a hearing that ran “headlong” into federal court rules.","“The district court’s crediting his testimony impermissibly anchored the district court’s own negative view of the plausibility of Palin’s allegations,” he wrote.","Walker also rejected the Times’ view that Palin at most showed that Bennet made an unintended mistake, saying she plausibly alleged that Bennet might have been “reckless” in failing to first reacquaint himself with the Atlantic articles.",The judge also said the Times’ decision to swiftly correct the editorial after a social media backlash suggested that readers might have “perceived” the false statements about Palin as based on fact.,"The case is Palin v New York Times Co, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 17-3801."

Does it really make sense to help Netflix build a gigantic base of subscribers to the point where they could actually spend $9 billion a year making their own content and will pay me less and less for my library?” he asked.,"In 2007 the answer for Hollywood was yes. In exchange for billions of dollars, studios helped Netflix launch a fledgling streaming video service by licensing their libraries of shows and movies, but that decision may have sown the seeds of their own demise.","By 2016, Time Warner Inc was forced to sell itself to AT&T Inc and Rupert Murdoch sold his 21st Century Fox film and TV studios to Walt Disney Co.","Apple is the latest company to offer a direct-to-consumer streaming video, along with a news subscription service, by leveraging the power of its more than 1 billion devices.","Through its subscription news service, Apple will charge about $10 monthly for access to a variety of magazine and newspaper content, according to media reports. Apple is expected to take 50 percent of the revenue. The Wall Street Journal has agreed to join Apple’s service, according to a recent New York Times report. News Corp, owner of the Journal, was not immediately reachable for comment.","A monthly digital subscription to the New York Times costs $15, and Thompson said he has no plans to give that up to participate on other platforms such as Apple’s.","Last year, the Times generated over $700 million in digital revenue, close to the company’s target of $800 million in annual digital sales by 2020. Digital ad revenue surpassed print ad revenue for the first time in the fourth quarter of 2018. The Times has plowed investment back into its newsroom, which at 1,550 journalists is now at its largest ever.","Despite the company’s insistence on keeping readers on its own products and platforms, Thompson said it has experimented on other services, highlighting content the Times developed just for Snap Inc’s Snapchat app, which helped reach new, younger readers.","These new audiences, he said, will play a big role in helping the Times reach its new target of 10 million subscribers by 2025."

First, journalism,” Thompson said on a conference call.","Revenue from the Times’ digital-only subscription products, which gives readers access to news as well as its sought-after daily crossword puzzles and cooking recipes, rose 9.3 percent to $105.3 million in the quarter.","Net income attributable to shareholders was $55.2 million, or 33 cents per share, compared to a net loss of $56.8 million, or 35 cents per share, a year earlier, when the company booked one-time charges related to tax reform and pension settlements.","Total revenue rose to $502.7 million from $484.1 million a year earlier, which included an additional week.","Excluding one-time items, the company earned 32 cents per share from continuing operations.","Analysts on average estimated a profit of 28 cents per share and revenue of $477.1 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv."

Concerns over Facebook’s business sparked the biggest one-day wipeout in U.S. stock market history in July.",Systrom wrote in a blog post on Monday that he and Krieger planned to take time off and explore “our curiosity and creativity again”.,"Their announcement came after increasingly frequent clashes with Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg over the direction of Instagram, Bloomberg reported.","In a statement, Zuckerberg described the two as “extraordinary product leaders”.","“I’ve learned a lot working with them for the past six years and have really enjoyed it. I wish them all the best and I’m looking forward to seeing what they build next,” Zuckerberg said.",Koum’s departure in May followed the exit of his WhatsApp co-founder Brian Acton.,"That led to a reshuffling of Facebook’s executive ranks, increasing Zuckerberg’s ability to influence day-to-day operations. Zuckerberg ally Chris Cox, who leads product development for Facebook’s main app, gained oversight of WhatsApp and Instagram, which had been given independence when Facebook bought them.","Adam Mosseri, who had overseen Facebook’s news feed and spent a decade working closely with Zuckerberg, became Instagram’s head of product.","Instagram and Facebook have operated independently and the two services barely mention each other. But as regulators have pushed Facebook to improve information safeguards for individual privacy, to combat addiction to social media, and to stop misinformation or fake news, Zuckerberg and other leaders have been under more pressure to monitor units beyond the core social network.","Systrom and Krieger notified the photo-sharing app’s leadership team and Facebook on Monday about their decision to leave, Instagram said. Their departure would be soon, it said. The New York Times first reported the move.",Systrom and Krieger met through Stanford University and worked separately in Silicon Valley before forming Instagram in 2010.,"Facebook bought Instagram in 2012 for $1 billion. The photo-sharing app has over 1 billion active monthly users and has grown by adding features such as messaging and short videos. In 2016, it added the ability to post slideshows that disappear in 24 hours, mimicking the “stories” feature of Snap Inc’s Snapchat.","The photo app’s global revenue this year is likely to exceed $8 billion, showed data from advertising consultancy EMarketer.",Increased advertising on Instagram has seen the average price-per-ad across Facebook’s apps decline this year after a year of upswing. A new privacy law in Europe also has affected prices.,"Instagram had been hailed in Silicon Valley as a flashy acquisition done right, with the team kept relatively small and Systrom having the freedom to add features such as peer-to-peer messaging, video uploads and advertising.","“I see Mark [Zuckerberg] practice a tremendous amount of restraint in giving us the freedom to run, but the reason why I think he gives us the freedom to run is because when we run, it typically works,” Systrom told Recode last June.","The app’s latest product, IGTV, has been slow to gain traction. Offered through Instagram and as a standalone app, IGTV serves up longer-length video content, mostly from popular Instagram users.",Video content has been a major emphasis for Facebook as it seeks to satisfy advertisers’ desire to stream more commercials online.
