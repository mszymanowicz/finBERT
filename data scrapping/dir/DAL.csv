Trump falsely claims he lost due to widespread voting fraud.,"Representative Diana DeGette, one of nine Democratic impeachment managers who will argue the House’s case against Trump, said House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was working out with Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell when to transmit the article of impeachment to the Senate, triggering the trial process.","“This is a situation where you have the crime pretty much being committed on national television,” DeGette, a former trial lawyer, said, adding: “It’s a shockingly evident case.”","In a 232-197 vote on Wednesday, Trump became the first president to be impeached twice and will likely be the first to face an impeachment trial after leaving office.","Ten Republicans joined the majority Democrats in supporting impeachment, while others argued Trump’s remarks were protected by the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which defends free speech.",The action is highly unlikely to lead to Trump’s ouster before Biden takes office next Wednesday. McConnell has said no trial could begin until the Senate was scheduled to be back in regular session on Tuesday.,"Impeachment managers will be working through the weekend to compile a list of witnesses they want to call to testify and honing their arguments for conviction, DeGette said.","If Trump has left the White House, the Senate could convict him and then vote to ban him from running for office again.","Biden, a Democrat, has urged Senate leaders not to allow the impeachment trial to get in the way of other priorities in his first days in office such as an economic stimulus bill, coronavirus vaccine distribution improvements and confirming crucial Cabinet nominees.","Biden’s inauguration has been scaled back due to security concerns and the COVID-19 pandemic.

The mob disrupted Congress’s certification of Biden’s victory, sent lawmakers into hiding and left five people dead, including a police officer.","A two-thirds majority in the Senate would be needed to convict and remove Trump, meaning at least 17 Republicans in the 100-member chamber would have to join the Democrats.","Republican Senator Lisa Murkowski, who has already called for Trump to resign over his actions on Jan. 6, said on Thursday that the House’s impeachment was appropriate. In a statement, she said that when the case comes before the Senate: “I will listen carefully and consider the arguments of both sides, and will then announce how I will vote.”","In the trial, Trump’s legal team may argue that his comments were not a call to violence and were protected under the First Amendment, some legal experts said.","They said that all sorts of lawful rhetoric could be proper grounds for impeachment, however, and that Congress had wide latitude to define “incitement” as it sees fit in the impeachment process.","“Even if his speech was protected by the First Amendment, he can still be impeached for it,” said Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University. “High-ranking officials get fired for their speech all the time.”",Trump’s team could also argue that holding an impeachment trial after he has left office would violate the Constitution.,"But there is precedent for Congress impeaching former federal officials and the Constitution explicitly says that impeachment is not just for removing officials but also for disqualifying them from future office, the experts said.","Trump also may face state legal actions on leaving office, including a criminal probe in New York into whether he inflated asset values to obtain loans and tax benefits in his business dealings.",The House impeached Trump in 2019 on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress stemming from his request that Ukraine investigate Biden and his son Hunter.

But just like Gol, the Atlanta-based carrier, which said in July it was burning $27 million a day here, has little cash to spare due to the coronavirus pandemic.","Gol’s struggles are just the latest challenge for Delta, whose investments in Latin America, once seen as a growth area, have faltered due to COVID-19.",Delta's 49% stake in Aeromexico and 20% stake in LATAM Airlines Group are at risk of dilution or being wiped here out as both airlines undergo bankruptcy restructurings.,"For Gol, Brazil’s largest carrier, the due date of the Delta-backed private loan comes amid a severe cash crunch. The loan was extended by unidentified private investors.","“Gol is facing constant cash burn without refinancing possibilities,” said Amalia Bulacios, who covers Gol for S&P Global Ratings, which rates its debt as CCC-, at risk of default.","By Monday, before repaying the loan, Gol could have just 1.6 billion reais ($285.19 million) left in cash, Reuters calculated. The calculation is based on Gol’s cash and cash equivalents, as well as its liquid investments, as of June 30, minus its expected cash burn of 3 million reais a day.","“We are three business days away from the deadline and the company has been very silent; it’s not even clear if there is a negotiation under way,” she added.",Gol and Delta declined to confirm if any negotiations were occurring. A source familiar with the matter said negotiations were indeed taking place.,"The situation echoes that of Colombia's Avianca Holdings AVT_p.CN in May, when it filed for bankruptcy because of a debt repayment deadline the next day. Analysts, however, said Gol's restructuring needs are much simpler than Avianca's and could potentially happen out of court.","Raising cash at the 11th hour, however, appears unlikely.","While Brazil’s government has offered Gol 2 billion reais ($356.49 million) in loans, two sources said it would not release the money unless Gol manages to postpone its debt deadline. Brazil wants the funds to be used on the airline’s operations, not to repay creditors.","Meanwhile, Gol executives acknowledged last month that the airline has little prospect of raising fresh capital.","“There’s a certain aversion to Brazil, a certain aversion to airlines, and then we’re kind of in the cross-set of that bucket,” Gol’s CFO Richard Lark said during the company’s earnings call. “It’s not really there, the private market.”",Gol’s debt troubles show how quickly the coronavirus upended the balance sheets of airlines around the world.,"For years, Gol underplayed the significance of the $300 million loan. Executives said not only that they would repay it in full but that they would do so ahead of schedule.","As late as Feb. 25, even as the pandemic raged in Asia and Europe, a Gol presentation said the airline had “no relevant maturities in next five years.”","Now, Gol’s future hangs in the balance because of the once apparently insignificant loan coming due.","Delta, which has long expanded worldwide by buying into other carriers, in 2015 injected $56 million of equity into Gol and guaranteed the $300 million loan. At the time, Gol executives said they could not have raised the debt without Delta’s backing.",Delta sold its stake in Gol in 2019 to buy its stake in Gol rival LATAM Airlines but maintained the loan guarantee.,"If Gol fails to make the payment and Delta is forced to step in, Delta will have the option of seizing the Brazilian airline's stake in its publicly traded loyalty program, Smiles Fidelidade SMLS3.SA, which secured the loan.",But Gol’s stake in Smiles is only worth 954 million reais ($170.04 million). And the loyalty program has little strategic value given that Delta ditched Gol for LATAM Airlines.,"“If Delta does that, it will strangle Gol’s cash position, put Gol’s survival at risk and become a shareholder of Smiles, a company that itself needs Gol to be successful,” said Ricardo Fenelon, a former head of Brazil’s aviation regulator ANAC.",“It doesn’t make much sense.”,($1 = 5.6103 reais)

If the cabin is not up to par, they call back the cleaners.","“Even if that means taking a delay to the flight,” said Medeiros, who is among managers who receive daily cleanliness reports in their inbox based on customer surveys taken after every flight.","“As important as (being) on-time is to our company, we know that cleanliness, particularly in this environment but also going forward, will be just as important,” he said.","Delta’s average clean time for its domestic fleet is now 20 minutes, up from 10 minutes to 15 minutes previously depending on the aircraft size, but it aims to speed up the procedure to protect its turn times once schedules are heavier by adding resources.","To verify levels of cleanliness, Delta is purchasing ATP test kits that measure the amount of bacteria on airplane and airport surfaces. The kits cannot test for COVID-19.","It has already purchased 30 of the hand-held units, which cost about $1,000 each, to test the effectiveness of its cleaning program. The plan is to buy the tests for all of its global airport bases, though details are still being developed.","Among large U.S. rivals, American Airlines AAL.O said it has doubled the strength of its cabin cleaning crews but has not had to add extra time to its turns given lighter passenger loads and fewer scheduled flights.",United Airlines UAL.O said it has added some extra time to its cleaning process but not workers given the lighter loads.,"Southwest Airlines LUV.N, whose low-cost model depends on quick turns, has not added staffing and said this month it was scaling back some pre-flight cleaning with a view to preserving an average 45-minute turn once its schedule ramps up. It is still using an electrostatic and an anti-microbial spray that kill viruses and shield surfaces for 30 days, as well as a broad-spectrum disinfectant for lavatories and tray tables before every flight, but is not wiping down seat belts or arm rests.","All of the airlines are eyeing new cleaning technology. United, for example, is testing ultraviolet sanitation deployed by drones and hand-held wands for airport and aircraft surfaces. Delta is rolling out antimicrobial LED light technology by Vital Vio in all its aircraft restrooms that will continuously prevent the growth of bacteria, fungi, mold and yeast.","The airline is also in talks with Boeing Co BA.N and Airbus SE AIR.PA on developing touchless restrooms and is studying a UV light that would sterilize lavatories when they are not in use, Medeiros said.","Last week Delta said it would continue blocking middle seats through Jan. 6. Southwest is limiting seating capacity through October, while American and United are selling all seats. Beyond the jet, Delta is looking at bipolar ionization to improve air filtration at its airport facilities, including jetways. Airplanes already use hospital-grade HEPA that refresh air every two to four minutes. “We’re not afraid of adding costs to the business, but it has to add value,” said Medeiros. “If people are fearful or uncomfortable, travel won’t come back in the near term.”"

Aeromexico this week became the third Delta partner to file for bankruptcy due to the coronavirus pandemic, following LATAM Airlines Group and Virgin Australia.","In Latin America, Delta spent nearly $3 billion to build up stakes in Aeromexico and LATAM over the past three years.","The investments had promise before the pandemic, but their valuations have since been crushed and could be leveled entirely if equity holders are wiped out, as is common in Chapter 11 reorganizations.","Even if that does not happen, Delta faces diluted equity stakes if other partners come in through the two airlines’ reorganizations, as well as a probable downsizing. Both factors could make them less promising partners to connect with its flights.","In the worst case scenario, it would be at the back of the queue if either company liquidates, getting pennies on the dollar.","But over the longer term, partnerships could be a way for U.S. airlines to reboot international travel, which is expected to recover more slowly than domestic travel.","“A restructured set of partners ... could end up being the way that the U.S. majors reconstruct their global networks,” said Vik Krishnan, who leads McKinsey’s Travel practice in North America. “In other words, they become more reliant on these partnerships rather than less.”","Even if Delta did want to trim back its global partnerships, the bankruptcies mean that any stake sale would make little sense, at a time when Aeromexico and LATAM are valued at record lows.","One consultant said there was a chance Delta could chip in some funds to help Aeromexico survive, given the importance of the market across the southern U.S. border.","“Delta has spent time, money and effort on Aeromexico. If they had to rescue them, I think they would,” said Carlos Ozores, an aviation consultant at ICF.","It might not be as inclined to rescue LATAM, Ozores said, partly because the relationship is much newer.",Delta Chief Executive Ed Bastian has said the company stands by its partners.,"Following Aeromexico’s bankruptcy, Bastian forecast it would emerge from Chapter 11 “well positioned to succeed and will be a stronger partner for Delta.”","But the carrier, which has received $5.4 billion in U.S. government aid to pay employees through September, has shown no willingness to put cash into foreign partners’ restructurings.","The Financial Times on Wednesday reported Delta would support Virgin Atlantic, in which it holds a 49% stake, with deferred payments on branding fees and shared IT platforms.","Its approach contrasts with that of state-controlled Qatar Airways, which owns a 10% in LATAM and has joined other shareholders to commit $900 million in cash to the Chilean carrier.",Delta spokesman Morgan Durrant said the bankruptcies do not affect its financial position or the state of its balance sheet.,"For years Delta built a foothold in new markets through joint ventures, which allow airlines to coordinate fares and schedules. By buying stakes, it also got to appoint board members to have a say in its partners’ strategies.","But with border restrictions and international travel at a near standstill, the partnerships’ economic and strategic value has been vastly curtailed, analysts said.","Three of Latin America's largest airlines - LATAM, Aeromexico and Avianca Holdings AVT_p.CN - are now in Chapter 11, as governments avoided potential bailout packages. Analysts expect a changed post-crisis landscape in the region with fewer competitors and higher ticket prices.","Delta paid $2 billion for a 20% in LATAM just 3-1/2 months before global travel imploded in March. With that money, it could now buy LATAM more than twice over.","It booked the value of its 49% stake in Aeromexico at $833 million in 2019, but as of Wednesday the investment was only worth about $85 million, according to the market cap value from Refinitiv, a data provider.","In its bankruptcy papers, Aeromexico called its relationship with Delta “extremely important in strengthening its position in the Mexico-United States travel market,” the Mexican carrier’s largest and most critical international market.","Delta also owns stakes in Air France KLM and Korean Air, and has a joint venture partnership with Virgin Australia, which is set to be bought out of administration by U.S. private equity group Bain Capital, and joint venture agreement with Canada’s WestJet pending U.S. regulatory approval.","It had been negotiating a stake in Italy’s Alitalia which, since the pandemic, is expected to survive only by being re-nationalized."

In doing so, it has provided Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs) with a rare opportunity to buy a syndicated loan for a company that still carries an investment grade rating from one of the three major ratings agencies.","The US CLO market is the single-largest buyer of new leveraged loans, but as CLO creation remains low, new leveraged transactions will struggle to be broadly syndicated among investors. The coronavirus’ impact has also led to a wave of downgrades to loans owned by CLOs. These vehicles can only hold a limited amount of facilities rated CCC, which is just a few steps above default. Otherwise, the funds run the risk of triggering tests within the CLO that can limit returns for equity holders.","Already this month, 14 institutional term loan borrowers have defaulted on their debt, just one shy of the record set back in 2009, according to a report from Fitch Ratings on Wednesday.","Delta’s new loan, however, is rated Baa2 by Moody’s Investors Service and BBB- by S&P Global Ratings and Fitch. It offers investors not only the safety of a higher credit rating, but security through airport slots and returns typically found in riskier single B rated deals.","“If CLOs have some powder, they will probably provide a bid given the ratings and the spread on offer,” said Tim Gramatovich, chief investment officer at investment advisory firm Gateway Credit Partners.","Delta’s short three-year US$1.5bn loan is being offered at 500bp over Libor at a discount of 97 cents on the dollar, which equals a yield-to-maturity of approximately 7.3%, according to two bankers familiar with the deal terms.","Moreover, if Delta seeks any incremental debt to this loan in the future, it will have to cough up an extra 50bp to lenders in the so-called ‘most favored nation’ protection.",The airline must also maintain at least US$2bn in unrestricted liquidity throughout the life of the loan and has secured the debt against airport slots and routes that Delta operates to Europe and Latin America.,"“CLOs are looking for a combination of security, (high) ratings and coupon. Some new issues will meet all three of these and are a great offset to some of the CCC sales,” said Michael Herzig, a managing director at investment firm First Eagle Investment Management.","Barclays is arranging the loan. Lenders have until April 27 to commit to the terms on offer, the sources said.","A spokesperson for Delta did not respond to a request for comment, and a spokesperson for Barclays declined to comment.","In January, peer American Airlines, rated Ba3 by Moody’s and BB- by S&P Global Ratings, was able to amend its US$1.2bn term loan with investors to a razor-thin margin of 175bp over Libor and extend the maturity to 2027 from 2021, Refinitiv LPC reported at the time.","Fast-forward three months, however, and the higher-rated Delta is offering a significantly juicier coupon with higher ratings to obtain investor support.","Atlanta, Georgia-headquartered Delta posted its first quarterly loss in more than five years, according to the company’s earnings report on Wednesday.",Revenues nose-dived in the first three months of 2020 to US$8.59bn from US$10.47bn in the first quarter of 2019 as the airline took a hit from coronavirus.,"Moody’s, which rates Delta as investment grade at Baa3 and its term loan at Baa2, said the passenger airline sector is “most significantly” affected by the pandemic given the exposure to travel restrictions, the ratings agency said in a report on Thursday.","Last month, S&P Global Ratings downgraded Delta to BB from BBB- due to the drop in passenger demand.","Despite the headwinds, Delta’s new term loan is expected to draw strong demand from investors due to the collateral package on offer and the airline’s significant liquidity, according to a third banking source.",Delta has made a concerted effort to raise cash in the last month.,"The term loan was launched alongside a US$1.5bn bond sale on Thursday, the company’s first as a high-yield issuer, according to Refinitiv data.","On March 20, Delta said it obtained a US$2.6bn secured credit facility and also drew down US$3bn from its revolving credit lines, according to a company press release."

On one side is Korean Air CEO Walter Cho who is a friend of Delta Chief Executive Ed Bastian and is widely believed to backed by Delta. Together, with other Cho family members, they would command about 40% of the voting rights for Hanjin.","On the other is activist fund KCGI, which has built up a near 18% stake to become the top shareholder in Hanjin and has joined hands with Walter Cho’s older sister Heather, a former executive at the airline who lost her job after a famed ‘nut rage’ incident in 2014.","Their camp has roughly 37% of Hanjin’s voting rights and are backing Kim Shin-bae, a former CEO of a telecom company, to replace Walter Cho as a Hanjin board member.","Delta took 4.3% in Hanjin last year, two years after announcing a joint venture with Korean Air and after Walter and Heather Cho’s father died. It has been increasing the stake and new data released on Thursday showed the holding now stands at 13.98%.","That stake build-up is at odds with a public filing Delta made last year that says it will not influence Hanjin’s management, Kang Sung-boo, head of KCGI or Korea Corporate Governance Improvement Fund, told Reuters.","Under Korean law, investors with a stake of 5% or more must declare if they are a passive investor or plan to influence management; if the latter, they are subject to higher scrutiny by regulators.","Kang added that he believes if Delta votes at a March 27 shareholder meeting, it would suggest that the U.S. firm intends to influence management and he might pursue legal action to find out more information.","“I have concerns that Delta’s board and top executives could be violating Korea’s securities laws,” he said, adding that his legal advisor said Delta should have made a filing which made clear its intent to exert influence.",KCGI said it would decide in the coming days whether it would make a direct request to Delta to abstain.,"Delta declined to comment on Kang’s remarks. It has made no public comments about the increase in its stake in Hanjin or whether it backs Walter Cho. But its stake buildup has been interpreted as support for Walter Cho, with the market doubling Hanjin’s stock price this year on expectations of a cut-throat proxy war.",Bastian said last June shortly before the announcement of Delta’s initial purchase in Hanjin that his friendship with Walter Cho stretches back 20 years.,"Legal and corporate governance experts contacted by Reuters said that under South Korean law, Delta can be a passive investor and still retain the right to vote at a shareholders meeting.",The run-up in Hanjin’s share price this year to record levels comes despite Korean Air having to cut 80% of its capacity and put its cabin crew members on leave due to the spread of the coronavirus.,"The airline’s labor union has said it opposes KCGI and Heather Cho’s proposals, arguing their candidates do not have sufficient airline industry experience and has urged shareholders to vote against them."

Eight of every 10 passengers in Latin America traveling outside the region are bound for North America, according to industry group ALTA.","Following its breakup with Chile-based LATAM last month, American Airlines quickly announced new flights next year from Miami to Chile and Peru — destinations where the two had been coordinating their routes with regulatory approval.","“This shows you that the (American-LATAM) partnership ultimately ended up undermining supply,” said Carlos Ozores, a principal at consulting company ICF. “There was no competition because these were two carriers that coordinated their fares and worked as one.”",American said it had “expanded routes and lowered prices” as a result of its coordination with LATAM in Chile and Peru.,"The combined strength of LATAM and American ultimately doomed their partnership, as Chile’s top court ruled in May that they could not expand their cooperation on travel to the United States.","By contrast, Delta’s historic weakness in the region has become a distinct advantage, allowing it to leapfrog competitors without facing as much regulatory scrutiny.","“American and LATAM had a number of overlaps that created issues,” Delta Chief Legal Officer Peter Carter told investors last month. “And we just don’t have that here.”",LATAM declined to comment.,American said in a statement it “remains the largest U.S. carrier to both Latin and South America and we look forward to competing and growing in this region of the world.”,"American also announced an additional daily flight from Miami to Sao Paulo starting in 2020, a market where it did not have the level of coordination as in Chile or Peru. This will create stiffer competition, especially in Miami, a hub for both LATAM and American and a top destination for Latin Americans.","“It’s a very risky move because Delta is not very strong in Miami and American is very strong there,” said Luis Felipe Oliveira, ALTA’s executive director.","Delta has worked for much of the past decade to improve its standing in Latin America, investing in Brazil's Gol Linhas Aereas GOLL4.SA in 2011 and Grupo Aeromexico AEROMEX.MX the next year. In 2016, it made an offer for Colombia's Avianca Holdings AVT_p.CN, but was rebuffed in favor of United.","In recent years, Delta has grown frustrated with the Gol partnership, which did little for its South American push beyond Brazil. LATAM and Avianca have broader regional ambitions, investing in domestic airlines outside their home markets.","“So the natural thought is ... that produces a return that’s below your average return,” Glen Hauenstein, Delta’s president, told investors last month regarding the prior regional strategy.","Delta is in the process of selling its stake in Gol, and redoubling efforts in Colombia, Chile and Peru, which account for a combined 45% of South American travel to the United States, compared with just 29% percent from Brazil.","Air traffic in each of the three countries is expected to more than triple between 2020 and 2040, according to a forecast prepared by CAF, a Latin American development bank owned by countries in the region.","Colombia even rivals Brazil for U.S. travel. Last year, 3 million travelers flew between Brazil and North America, compared with 2.7 million who flew between Colombia and North America, according to worldwide industry group IATA. Colombia, which has a quarter of the population of Brazil, is also expected to grow its economy more quickly than its larger neighbor.","“The major market that we want to be in is Colombia,” Delta’s Hauenstein said.","LATAM is already making ambitious moves there. In May, it announced a $300 million investment in Colombia aimed at challenging market leader Avianca, which has allied with United and Copa Holdings CPA.N in their own regional play.",Delta is hoping it is arriving in time to reap the benefits of LATAM’s groundwork.

Delta declined to comment for this story.,"The company’s move to unload a stake in Monroe Energy could represent the first step in unwinding a bet that owning a refinery would lower its jet fuel costs, among an airline’s highest expense. The 2012 deal was criticized by some investors who saw the airline’s $150 million purchase as drifting from its core business.","The East Coast plant relies largely on imported crude, lacking access to less expensive shale and Canadian crude that benefits U.S. Midwest and Gulf Coast refineries. That means any Monroe sale would need to be at a deep discount to other recent refinery-related transactions, analysts said.","One possible scenario would be to allow a buyer to finance any purchase using the plant as collateral, reducing the initial capital required, analysts say.","“I think a trading company or private equity firm are the two ... most likely (bidders),” said Neil Earnest, president of energy consultancy Muse, Stancil & Co. “I don’t see an existing refiner or producer or retail guy that stands out as wanting that asset or needing that asset.”","Delta’s desire to retain a stake in the plant also means energy traders may be reluctant to bid on a plant they cannot fully control, he added.","While some gasoline retailers have bought refineries, the Trainer plant's lack of an existing distribution network reduces the number of potential buyers, Earnest said.

In the U.S. East Coast, four refineries closed in the past decade due to the rising costs of acquiring crude.","Ed Hirs, a professor of energy economics at the University of Houston, said the attempt to recruit a joint venture partner is no sure thing.","“It was a boneheaded decision then, and they are still paying for it.

The company downplayed the evaluation’s significance at the time, calling it routine.","East Coast refiners got a lifeline from the Bakken shale boom in North Dakota earlier this decade. Production there outpaced pipeline capacity, forcing producers to offer steep discounts to East Coast refiners like Monroe.","However, the discounts have vanished in recent years as more pipeline capacity came online in the upper U.S. Midwest.
