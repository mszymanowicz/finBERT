For instance, the company, like others, abandoned a trial of its older malaria medicine hydroxychloroquine after it failed to help patients in scientific studies.","Moreover, he said Novartis had hoped to be faster in developing new drugs against COVID-19 and could have potentially profited from more cooperation with smaller biotech companies. “We concentrated more on our own in-house activities - and learned a lesson from it,” he said.","Many of the medicines that Novartis is supplying for patients stricken with COVID-19 come from its Sandoz generics unit. For now, Narasimhan said Novartis is not interested in selling Sandoz, but rather continuing work to boost its sales and profit margins squeezed by U.S. price pressure.","“We believe at this time that we can do this best with Sandoz within the Novartis group,” he told the newspaper.","Novartis’ share price has fallen 15% this year, compared to peer Roche Holding AG’s 2% rise.","Beyond recent legal settlements in corruption cases that topped $1 billion, Narasimhan believes safety problems that emerged with new eye medicine Beovu have cost Novartis shares 10% of their value.","“Challenge No. 1 was Beovu’s launch,” he said."

Novartis is hoping to win away business.","“Patients can self-administer the treatment at home, avoiding visits to the infusion center,” Stephen L. Hauser, Director of the UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences and a leader of studies of Kesimpta that led to its approval.","Roche contends twice-yearly injections for Ocrevus, approved for relapsing MS as well as the primary progressive form of the disease, deliver a deep, effective response for patients.","Roche in May won European approval for a shorter, two-hour infusion for Ocrevus as it prepared for the arrival of Novartis’s rival medicine.

But there is not yet scientific proof that it works.",There are currently no approved medicines or vaccines specifically for COVID-19.,"“Right now, we’re in a sea of anecdotes, and a lot of non-professional, poorly-informed people are making recommendations that are swaying how the public and patients view this (drug),” Dr. Richard Chaisson, the Johns Hopkins University professor leading the trial, said in an interview.","Novartis said it got the go-ahead from the FDA for the trial and it hopes to start recruiting 440 patients within weeks at more than a dozen U.S. sites. Results will be reported as soon as possible, the company added.","Use of the drug, which is also approved to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, has soared since Trump started promoting it. But critics have expressed concern that the administration’s advocacy for an unproven medicine has short-circuited the FDA’s oversight process.","“We recognize the importance of answering the scientific question of whether hydroxychloroquine will be beneficial for patients with COVID-19 disease,” said John Tsai, Novartis’s top drug developer. “We mobilized quickly to address this question in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.”","Companies such as Novartis, Roche and Gilead Sciences Inc are testing older medicines developed to treat other diseases for signs they could be repurposed to tackle the coronavirus epidemic.","Gilead just expanded a trial of its antiviral drug remdesivir, which previously failed as a treatment for Ebola.","Still, some fear the championing of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19 has overshadowed potentially dangerous side effects like vision loss and heart problems. Novartis Chief Executive Vas Narasimhan has also said the medicine is one of his biggest hopes against the pandemic.","Chaisson said many of the clinical trials to research the drug are “either small or uncontrolled or overly ambitious.” He said the Novartis trial is designed to test the drug’s effectiveness quickly, and could yield results in June.","There are several additional studies of hydroxychloroquine underway, including at the University of Washington and University of Minnesota, as well as work by the National Institutes of Health in the United States.",Novartis' Sandoz generics unit has pledged to donate 130 million doses of the medicine.

The institute scrutinised Novartis’s Adakveo and GBT’s Oxbryta, both approved last year, and Emmaus Medical’s Endari, to treat the inherited disease that disproportionately affects African Americans.",The finding that the costs of all three medicines would likely have to be slashed to achieve acceptable cost-effectiveness thresholds comes as Congress and U.S. President Donald Trump weigh action over high healthcare costs.,Insurers and governments use privately funded ICER’s conclusions to help set reimbursement rates.,"ICER said it concluded that Adakveo’s annual cost should be $25,410, down from an estimated $88,000 bill, and that Oxbryta must be trimmed to $9,218 from about $84,000, to meet cost-effectiveness thresholds. Endari must be cut to $3,859 from $24,000 to be cost-effective, the group added.","“Treatment costs were the main driver of the cost-effectiveness results,” said ICER, which is taking public comment until Feb. 20 before final publication this year.","Shares in GBT fell more than 5.5% on Friday, while Novartis shares closed 0.3% lower.","ICER seeks to measure how many years of good health - a quality-adjusted life year, or QALY - may be gained with a new treatment, and the incremental cost for that health gain.","At the current estimated costs for Adakveo, Oxbryta and Endari, all the QALYs exceeded $1 million, ICER said, well above the $150,000 the group ordinarily considers an appropriate cost-effectiveness threshold.","Novartis countered that ICER had not appropriately weighed Adakveo’s benefits, including reducing pain crises suffered by sickle cell disease (SCD) patients or potentially helping cut hospital stays.","“We look forward to gaining a better understanding of the approach ICER used to make its assessment and to helping them better understand the value of Adakveo,” Novartis said.","‘FLAWED, PREMATURE’",San Francisco-based GBT contended that ICER’s review conflicts with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s goal of speeding medicines to patients.,"“ICER’s review is flawed, premature and risks adversely impacting access to new, potentially transformative therapies,” GBT said.",U.S.-based Emmaus could not immediately be reached for comment.,"ICER said its draft report may change based on public comments, including from drugmakers. It also acknowledged setting a drug’s price may go beyond traditional measures of clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, to include other, non-financial considerations.",Recent advances in treating long-neglected sickle cell disease include the three medicines reviewed by ICER and an experimental gene therapy from Bluebird Bio Inc..,"Still, costs are of particular interest. More than half of the roughly 100,000 U.S. sickle cell disease patients are covered by government health insurance."

Treatment that includes bypassing agents given to stop bleeding in hemophilia patients with resistance to traditional clotting factor treatments can top $1 million.","Experts see Zolgensma becoming the treatment of choice for newborn patients who test positive for SMA, because gene therapy may offer infants yet to exhibit symptoms hope for normal development.","Risdiplam, seen by analysts as topping $1 billion in annual sales, and Spinraza, already a roughly $2 billion per year seller, are seen competing for older patients. Oral, daily risdiplam may be less complicated, given Spinraza is given every four months via an infusion in the spine.","Zolgensma is also being tested in older patients with a spinal infusion, though the trial has been halted due to safety concerns. Novartis is awaiting the FDA’s go-ahead to restart.","Novartis also is developing an oral drug, branaplam, though its chief researcher, Jay Bradner, in December indicated the company had cooled to the medicine, saying he did not “see a big opportunity for oral therapy there, or we would develop this molecule further”.","Novartis has since clarified its stance, saying its trial of branaplam would continue, with a decision to be made after the study produces data later this year."

Analysts at Cowen & Co forecast peak annual U.S. Oxbryta sales reaching $1.7 billion.","GBT spokesman Steven Immergut said some health plans, including private insurers as well as government-run Medicaid and Medicare, have started to cover Oxbryta on a case-by-case basis. The company said it has received positive feedback from payers in early discussions.","Depending on the state, Medicaid can take as long as 12-to-18 months to approve new medications, particularly expensive ones that put a strain on state budgets. GBT has said it expects most Medicaid programs to take at least three-to-six months to approve its drugs.","The majority of the nearly 100,000 people in the United States with sickle cell anemia are African American. Around 85 percent of sickle cell patients live in 17 U.S. states, including Florida and Alabama, and more than half are insured either by Medicare or Medicaid, according to Novartis and GBT.",‘HISTORIC TIME FOR THE SICKLE CELL COMMUNITY’,Adakveo is a biologic drug delivered as a once-a-month infusion to prevent the pain crises often associated with sickle cell disease.,Oxbryta is a once daily pill that treats the disease’s underlying cause by raising hemoglobin levels and preventing the breakdown of red blood cells into a sickle - or crescent moon - shape.,"Their different impacts on the disease has raised the prospect that both drugs would be prescribed simultaneously, creating a greater cost burden to the U.S. healthcare systems. Florida approved the Novartis drug with a requirement that patients receive prior authorization from their physician, Mallik said, meaning that the state would review any prescriptions to make sure that patients meet certain criteria. Alabama approved it without restrictions, he added.","Although state Medicaid programs cannot simply refuse to cover FDA-approved drugs, they can attempt to save money by moving slowly to place the drug on reimbursement formularies or by requiring patients to go through extra steps to obtain reimbursement. A Novartis cancer therapy, Kymriah, which costs as much as $475,000, is still not covered by Medicaid in every state despite having been approved two years ago, Mallik said.","Both Novartis and GBT began meeting with state Medicaid officials ahead of the FDA approvals to discuss the treatment and have advocated for its inclusion on formularies, or official reimbursement lists, both companies told Reuters.","“We have been meeting with both government and commercial payers for several months – initially educating about sickle hemoglobin polymerization and, more recently, about Oxbryta,” Immergut said. Patient advocacy groups, such as the state-level chapters of the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America (SCDAA), also are meeting with policymakers to encourage them to make the drug accessible to patients, said Biree Andemariam, the group’s chief medical officer.","“This is a really historic time for the sickle cell community,” she said. “Patients are ready to take advantage of these new treatments.”","(The story corrects second paragraph to say Mallik is the U.S., not global head, of Novartis’ oncology division and ninth paragraph to say Adakveo is a once-a-month infusion, not injected several times a month)"

The Food and Drug Administration’s approval came nearly two months ahead of its due date for a decision in January.","Novartis has forecast that the drug’s annual sales will top $1 billion, much of which will likely come from U.S. government payers such as Medicare and Medicaid.","The drug is the first to offer patients with sickle cell disease targeted relief from pain crises, a common symptom of sickle cell disease, which often also causes swelling, infections, and vision problems. Current treatments, which include blood transfusions, drugs that increase haemoglobin, and pain medicines, only alleviate symptoms as they arise.","Novartis’ drug may soon face competition from Voxelotor, a once daily pill developed by Global Blood Therapeutics Inc that is awaiting a decision by the FDA due in February. Voxelotor aims to treat the underlying cause of sickle cell disease by preventing sickle cells from deforming.",Other potential cures for the disease that would alter genetic mutations responsible for blood cell sickling are also undergoing clinical trials run by drugmakers including Bluebird Bio Inc and Pfizer Inc.,"“Hope has never been higher for people living with sickle cell disease and their families and supporters, with a pipeline of new treatments on the horizon, like the one being approved today,” said acting FDA commissioner Brett Giroir.","About 100,000 people in the United States, most of African descent, suffer from the disease in which their red blood cells are sickle-shaped, leading to episodes of intense pain, infections and deadly strokes.","Novartis is targeting patients who suffer two or more pain crises per year, around 60% of the total population with the disease.","According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, 55,349 people who were covered by Medicaid, the government insurance for poor Americans, were identified with sickle cell disease.","Chief Executive Vas Narasimhan has said Novartis placed a “big focus” on access in the lead-up to approval, including discussions with Medicaid.","In 2018, the company launched a campaign that includes enlisting African-American actor Jordin Sparks, the 2007 “American Idol” winner, to help increase awareness in communities where people are most likely to suffer from the disease.","Sickle cell disease remains most prevalent in sub-Saharan African countries, where many of the estimated 300,000 children born annually with the condition may die before the age of 5. The disease is also more common in India.","Novartis’ Narasimhan last year initiated a partnership with Ghana, seeking to boost early childhood diagnosis so kids can get antibiotics needed to keep them alive and to help create a paediatric formulation of a cheap, older drug, hydroxyurea, used for decades to help manage sickle cell disease’s symptoms."

The approval covers babies with the deadliest form of the inherited disease as well as those with types where debilitating symptoms may set in later.","“This is potentially a new standard of care for babies with the most serious form of SMA,” said Dr. Emmanuelle Tiongson, a pediatric neurologist at Children’s Hospital Los Angeles who has provided Zolgensma to patients under an expanded access program. “The job now is trying to negotiate with insurers that this would be a long-term savings.”","Novartis executives defended the price, saying that a one-time treatment is more valuable than expensive long-term treatments that cost several hundred thousand dollars a year.","Novartis touched off a debate over what gene therapy is worth last year, estimating its treatment would be cost-effective at up to $5 million per patient. A review in April by an independent U.S. group, the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER), concluded Novartis’ value estimate for Zolgensma was excessive.","But on Friday, ICER said that based on Novartis’ additional clinical data, the broad FDA label and its launch price, it believed that the drug fell within the upper bound of its range for cost-effectiveness.",Novartis said it was offering health insurers the option of installment payments for Zolgensma as well as refunds if the treatment does not work and upfront discounts for payers who commit to standardized coverage terms.,"Novartis Chief Executive Vas Narasimhan has much riding on Zolgensma, describing it as a near cure for SMA if delivered soon after birth. But data proving its durability extends to only about five years. The therapy uses a virus to provide a normal copy of the SMN1 gene to babies born with a defective gene. It is delivered by infusion.","Novartis is expecting European and Japanese approval later this year. Zolgensma will compete with Biogen Inc’s Spinraza, the first approved treatment for SMA.","The disease often leads to paralysis, breathing difficulty and death within months for babies born with the most serious Type I form. SMA affects about one in every 10,000 live births, with 50 percent to 70 percent having Type I disease.","Spinraza, approved in late 2016, requires infusion into the spinal canal every four months. Its list price of $750,000 for the initial year and $375,000 annually thereafter was also deemed excessive by ICER.","Some neurologists see gene therapy becoming the preferred treatment for newborns with severe SMA, while acknowledging that families may choose to wait for long-term safety and efficacy data for Zolgensma. Novartis is looking into whether the death of one severely ill baby treated with Zolgensma was related to the therapy.","“Most families will want to do the gene therapy since it avoids the frequent spinal taps,” said Dr. Russell Butterfield of the University of Utah in Salt Lake City. Butterfield has received payments from Biogen for consulting.",The FDA said it approved Zolgensma based on clinical trials involving 36 patients aged 2 weeks to 8 months. The agency said patients treated with Zolgensma showed significant improvement in developmental motor milestones such as head control and ability to sit up.,The most common side effects of Zolgensma are elevated liver enzymes and vomiting. The FDA is requiring Zolgensma’s label to include a warning that acute serious liver injury can occur.,"With additional studies underway, Novartis said it has so far treated more than 150 patients with Zolgensma, which was acquired with its $8.7 billion purchase of AveXis last year.","Wall Street analysts have forecast sales of $2 billion by 2022, according to a Refinitiv survey. Spinraza sales hit $1.7 billion last year, and are seen rising to $2.2 billion in 2022. Roche is developing risdiplam, an oral drug, for the condition and plans to file for approval later this year.","Novartis, Biogen and Roche, as well as patient advocates and neurologists, say babies with SMA who receive treatment before symptoms emerge stand the best chance of near-normal development. They are lobbying to make SMA screening standard for newborns in every market.","“Babies (with SMA) are losing motor neurons from the day they are born, so the ability to treat them as early as possible is the way you get maximum value out of the therapy,” David Lennon, who heads Novartis’ AveXis unit, said in a recent interview.","Dr. Laurent Servais, a child neurologist in Liege, Belgium, called any delay in implementing newborn SMA screening “completely unethical.”","Servais helped oversee a screening pilot program sponsored by the three companies. Southern Belgium is now screening 60,000 newborns annually, half the country’s total births. Taiwan has also begun testing babies for SMA.","But widespread adoption has a long way to go. In the United States, only six states have begun active and routine SMA newborn screening since the federal government recommended it in 2018. Patient advocates estimate it could take until 2022 for the testing to be implemented nationwide.","In Europe, it may be even slower.","England recommended against newborn screening in February and will not consider it again before 2021, a spokesman for Public Health England told Reuters. SMA advocates in Germany do not expect action on screening until late 2021.","“It’s astonishing,” said Inge Schwersenz, of the German Society for Neuromuscular Diseases. “But we can’t do anything to speed it up.”"

Zolgensma appears astonishingly effective against a rare, inherited disease, sufferers of which rarely live beyond four. Even so, the high price is likely to fuel the debate about whether any drug should cost that much. Sometimes, the answer is yes.","Health economists often measure a therapy’s value by putting a value of an individual living one year of good health. Countries, and increasingly insurers, use this approach. Novartis Chief Executive Vas Narasimhan said last month that Zolgensma, which is a one-time treatment, was cost-effective at up to a $5 million price tag, based on the assumption that a year of hospital-free healthy existence is worth $500,000. Society already pays high prices for cancer medications that provide a lower bang for their buck.","Bolstering the Swiss drugmaker’s case is the fact that companies need to earn a return on their investment, and if they don’t get it, they might not invest in future. Novartis paid $8.7 billion for AveXis, the developer of Zolgensma, in 2018. Most drugs fail to reach market, and for those that do it can take years before the company knows whether the price it settled on will cover its costs, which in this case include manufacturing a complex modified virus. The number of potential patients is small – perhaps one in 10,000.","The problem is that drugmakers also have an incentive to charge high prices just because the market can bear them. Americans account for about 40% of drug spending worldwide, helped by limited competition, unregulated prices, numerous middlemen and the government’s limited ability to negotiate. Patent-protected cancer drugs in the United States cost, on average, triple what they do in other nations. One sign of a failing market is when drugs boast not just high prices, but huge variation between similarly-wealthy countries.","In pricing terms Novartis has all three factors in its favor. Meanwhile, a rival drug to Zolgensma exists but must be administered every few months and appears less effective. The art for Novartis will be to maximize revenue while minimizing public outcry. Sure, it could set the price at $5 million – but settling for, say, half that would be healthier all around."

It will instead be included in the SMIM index, replacing Aryzta, SIX Swiss Exchange said after Tuesday’s market close.","Dominated by Nestle, Novartis and Roche, the SMI is Switzerland’s most important index. Membership is based on market capitalization, adjusted for the free float of readily tradable shares in its constituents.",Alcon is being spun off in a one-for-five share deal announced by Novartis last June as it focuses on new drugs rather than the surgical devices and contact lenses Alcon makes.,Joining the SMI may boost demand from funds focusing on the top Swiss companies. Yet Alcon’s inclusion means healthcare and medical technology will weigh even more heavily on the SMI.,"Novartis’s weighting had been capped 18 percent, but with Alcon the two will account for up to 21.5 percent of the SMI, Zuercher Kantonalbank analysts estimated on Wednesday.","Novartis’s biggest owners - BlackRock, the Sandoz family, Capital Research Global Investors and Vanguard Group - will have similar holdings in Alcon, between 2.5 percent and 4.5 percent.","“We anticipate incremental buying of Alcon shares by some funds seeking to build a full-size position, offset by others not wanting to own a non-pharma eyecare company,” Jefferies analyst Peter Welford said.","Novartis bought Alcon’s eye surgery and contact lens portfolio in stages through 2010 for $52 billion from Nestle, only to see it lose ground to competitors as sales and profitability slipped.","In surgical equipment, Alcon competes against Johnson & Johnson, Germany’s Zeiss and Bausch in a $9 billion per year market. Rivals in vision care, worth $14 billion annually, include J&J, Cooper and Bausch.","In 2016, a new Alcon head, Mike Ball from Hospira, redoubled research and marketing spending to resurrect revenue, before Novartis chief Vas Narasimhan decided to shed the division.","The last comparable-sized Swiss listing was in 2010, when oil driller Transocean floated on the same day its Deepwater Horizon rig exploded in the Gulf of Mexico."

It said the drug’s benefits were not statistically significant in patients with non-active MS.","In a 1,651-person trial, 26 percent of patients who got Mayzent saw their disability progress after three months, less than the 32 percent of patients who got a placebo, amounting to a relative risk reduction of 21 percent.","The drug’s cost will likely attract attention, as the independent Boston-based group Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) has already suggested in a draft report that Mayzent, at the Novartis price, likely far exceeds levels generally thought to be cost-effective.","“We will find a way to bring it to market, so patients get the best clinical choice,” Hudson said. “I think we’ve been very responsible with the pricing of it.”","So far, however, ICER has concluded Novartis would have to price Mayzent between $680 and $1,000 per month for it be considered cost-effective.","Hudson said ICER’s figures could change in its final report, due out in June. “Wait and see how that plays out,” he said, adding Novartis was still working to help people understand Mayzent’s benefits.","Novartis’ older Gilenya MS drug, its top seller at $3.34 billion annually, has a list price of $95,594 annually. Roche’s new MS drug, Ocrevus, with 2018 sales of $2.4 billion, lists at $65,000. Novartis sees Mayzent, a synthetic derivative of Gilenya modified to reduce side effects like a slow heart rate and better protect nerves from destruction, as a way to help often-older patients whose disease moves past relapsing MS to a progressively worsening condition.","Hudson called Mayzent a potential blockbuster with annual sales of more than $1 billion, while revenue is estimated at about $800 million by 2022, according Refinitiv data.","Stefan Schneider, a Bank Vontobel analyst, forecasts $600 million peak annual sales.","With Mayzent’s approval for the active form of SPMS, Schneider said that leaves it in competition with existing drugs and puts the onus on Novartis’s marketing force to convince doctors to switch from medicines they know better.","“Novartis will need to promote SPMS testing and change of therapy, likely not an easy endeavor,” he said."

Over 2019, the company expects to increase commercial and clinical capacity for Kymriah four-fold after buying more production facilities and deals with partners.","The Swiss firm hopes expanding its treatment geography will narrow the sales gap with Gilead Sciences’ Yescarta, which reaped $183 million in the first nine months of 2018.",Novartis already has NICE’s go-ahead for children and young people with aggressive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) when other drugs have failed.,"The Basel-based company now has 26 treatment centers in the European Union and Kymriah is now commercially available to patients from 10 countries, it said.","Kymriah belongs to a new class of treatments, like Yescarta, called CAR-T therapies where disease-fighting T cells are removed from a patient and genetically modified to better recognize and attack cancer.",They are then re-infused into the same patient where they can circulate for years to seek out and fight the disease.,"Novartis is also working with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to resolve a snag in which some batches of Kymriah did not meet commercial specifications, forcing the company to give it away for free to some patients.","“We expect resolution ... soon,” a spokeswoman said."

Credit Suisse analysts said the projections appeared “light of expectations”.","Narasimhan, who took over last February, has unloaded an over-the-counter drugs joint venture to GlaxoSmithKline, is selling Novartis’ U.S. generics pills business, and aims to spin off the Alcon eyecare unit to shareholders.","Simultaneously, he is loading up on gene and cell therapies and radioactive cancer drugs via acquisitions as he turns Novartis from a healthcare conglomerate into a more-focused prescription drugs company.","“A company of our size and with a goal to really re-imagine medicine needs to have a leading position in the next wave of therapeutics,” Narasimhan told reporters.","Fourth-quarter core operating profit rose to $3.39 billion, shy of the average $3.44 billion in a Reuters poll of analysts.","Sales rose to $13.3 billion, matching the poll. Full-year sales rose 5 percent to $51.9 billion, delivering on Novartis’s 2018 goal of mid-single-digit percentage growth.",A 2019 outlook devoid of fireworks left analysts underwhelmed.,"“With ... 2019 guidance at the bottom end of our expectations, we hope new catalysts will emerge to support the investment case,” wrote Eric Le Berrigaud of Bryan, Garnier & Co. in a note. He rates the shares “buy.”","Novartis said 2018 sales of its Entresto heart failure medicine doubled to $1 billion, while revenue from psoriasis-and-arthritis medicine Cosentyx rose more than a third to $2.8 billion. It added two more $1 billion-plus “blockbusters”, Promacta and skin-cancer combination Tafinlar-Mekinist, each hitting $1.2 billion.","Narasimhan is seeking bolt-on acquisitions up to $10 billion, but not deals like Bristol Myers-Squibb’s $74 billion offer for Celgene this month.","“Large M&A is not our focus,” Narasimhan said. “In the $5 billion-or-higher range, it tends to be more difficult to justify a premium that can create an attractive return.”","Novartis booked 2018 net profit of $12.6 billion, up 64 percent, on proceeds from the joint venture disposal to Glaxo. Still, it is raising its dividend just 1.8 percent, to 2.85 Swiss francs per share, less than the 2.93 francs poll forecast.","Chief Financial Officer Harry Kirsch defended the modest hike, given Novartis does not plan to reduce its dividend next year after shedding its eyecare business.","The company’s 2018 operating profit fell 5 percent to $8.2 billion, hurt by restructuring charges as it cuts 2,550 jobs in Switzerland and Britain."

It has been ramping up production for six months, and Germany is the first European market where Novartis will sell its medicine to treat conditions such as arthritis and Crohn’s disease.","After a Swiss newspaper reported on Thursday it could split off Sandoz, Novartis said it was “completely committed” to the business, where it is banking on biosimilars like Zessly to help it raise margins that are under pressure in the United States amid fierce competition for generic pills.","J&J’s Remicade had some $7 billion in sales in 2016, though revenue is eroding as it loses market share to cheaper biosimilars - near copies of biological medicines that have lost patent protection - made by Pfizer and Celltrion, as well as Samsung Bioepis and Merck.","Despite being third to market with its Remicade copy, Novartis is hoping infliximab replicates the success of its copy of Roche’s $7 billion-per-year blockbuster Rituxan: Novartis said its version, called Rixathon, has after 15 months a larger market share in Germany than the original medicine, as well as another biosimilar that also had a head start.","Novartis now has seven approved biosimilars in Europe, where it has enjoyed more success with its portfolio of near-copies than in the more sluggish U.S. market.

[reut.rs/2HojtnT]","NASH, which is closely associated with obesity and diabetes, is emerging as a major global health concern, especially among populations with increasingly fatty diets. Unchecked, it can lead to advanced cirrhosis and liver failure.","Drugmakers like Pfizer, Novartis, Gilead Sciences Inc and Allergan PLC see the potential $20 billion to $35 billion market, according to some estimates, as a source of future growth. Several small companies that have been focused on NASH treatments are well ahead of Pfizer and Novartis in their efforts, including Intercept Pharmaceuticals and France’s Genfit.","While studies have shown increased exercise and altering dietary patterns can be a first-line of defense against the disease, Eric Hughes, who heads Novartis’s hepatology development program, has seen first hand the need for pharmaceutical options.","“As a physician, I told everyone about exercise, lifestyle changes and diet,” Hughes said. “And I was lucky if I got 5 percent that even listened to me.","“This is an epidemic of 38 million people in the U.S., and to treat all those people who are advanced in their disease requires therapy,” Hughes added.","The companies will test Novartis’s tropifexor in various combinations with three experimental Pfizer medicines, with the idea of attacking different aspects of NASH, said Morris Birnbaum, Pfizer Internal Medicine’s chief scientific officer.","“The way this disease develops is, first you get fat in the liver, and then for reasons which nobody understands, the fat provokes an inflammatory response ... and then lastly, you get scarring and fibrosis,” Birnbaum said. The combination therapy would target all three stages of the disease, he said.","Pfizer’s drugs are aimed at steatosis, or fat accumulation in the liver. Novartis’s molecule fights inflammation and fibrotic scarring.","The collaboration is not exclusive. Novartis’s 2017 partnership with Allergan testing tropifexor with an Allergan drug will continue, Hughes said.","It is too early to predict when NASH patients might receive combination Pfizer-Novartis treatments, Hughes said.","But the deal shows there is still an appetite for tackling chronic conditions that affect millions of people at a time when many drugmakers, including Pfizer and Novartis, have increasingly directed resources to treatments for rare diseases that can command extremely high prices."

Sales rose 3 percent to $12.78 billion, shy of the $12.84 billion poll average.","It now sees 2018 revenue growing by a mid-single-digit percentage range, above the previous forecast of low-to-mid-single-digit growth.","But analysts said investors were more keen on Narasimhan’s progress in recasting the broad European healthcare giant that former Chairman Daniel Vasella envisioned before his 2013 exit into a focused, data-driven drugmaker.","“Today is less about the earnings number and more about the company’s transition to much more of a pure-play pharma business, which seems to be going down well with investors,” Berenberg analyst Laura Sutcliffe said.","Novartis, whose shares were up 1.7 percent at 0830 GMT, has agreed to pay $24 per share in cash for Endocyte, more than 15 times its value in September 2017 and a 54 percent premium to Wednesday’s closing price.",‘BELOW-AVERAGE REACTION TIME’,"Still, some analysts worried Narasimhan waited too long.","“Note a below-average reaction time at the business development department considering that the Endocyte market cap was at $110 million only 12 months ago,” Baader Helvea’s Bruno Bulic said.","Endocyte complements the nuclear medicine technology Novartis acquired with France’s AAA, including its Lutathera medicine for neuroendocrine tumors like the one that killed Apple founder Steve Jobs.","Narasimhan said that transaction prompted Novartis to expand relationships with U.S. and European nuclear medicine centers. After building his supply chain, Narasimhan needed more treatments.","“We said, ‘What other products can we bring in to leverage that global network we acquired earlier this year?’” he said. “With Endocyte, we saw a great fit.”","Endocyte’s and AAA’s treatments attach a radioactive atom to a molecule attracted to certain tumors, a process meant to kill the cancer while bypassing healthy tissues.","Endocyte Chief Executive Mike Sherman cited Novartis’s “global reach and expertise” as critical to getting its main medicine, PSMA-617 for castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), as well as its broader portfolio quickly to patients.","Centerview Partners advised Endocyte, with Jefferies assisting.

No one has been reported as sickened by the toxin, once used in the production of liquid rocket fuel.","Regulators and industry experts say the toxin almost certainly was introduced when Huahai changed the way it produced valsartan in 2012 - a modification that was signed off on by the European body that sets standards. Subsequent inspections by European, U.S. and Chinese regulators also found no problem.","“Everyone failed – the company, the inspectors, the FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration), the Europeans, the Chinese,” said Philippe André, an independent pharmaceutical auditor who inspected two Huahai facilities last August and found no critical concerns. “It’s a system failure.”","Reuters was unable to determine how Huahai first discovered the problem. In a July 7 statement released through the Shanghai Stock Exchange, it said it detected the toxin during the “optimization and evaluation” of its manufacturing process.","A Novartis spokesman told Reuters that its generic drugs arm, Sandoz, spotted the NDMA in the course of intensive testing to prepare for expanding its purchases of valsartan. He declined to comment further, including on the identity of the manufacturer or when the tests took place.",Two other smaller bulk suppliers - Zhejiang Tianyu Pharmaceutical 300702.SZ and a unit of India's Hetero Drugs - have since also discovered traces of NDMA in some of their valsartan.,The three companies declined to comment to comment about the case.,"For a graphic on heart drug widely used, click tmsnrt.rs/2KnaxAx",Huahai said in a document released through the Shanghai Stock Exchange it changed the production process to reduce waste and improve yields.,"“The NDMA impurity was produced in trace amounts during the normal manufacturing process according to the company’s current registered process,” it said in a statement on July 24.","“All changes in the company’s valsartan manufacturing process have been approved by each country’s drug regulator, and the company manufactures in compliance with legal and regulatory standards.”","The European Medicines Agency (EMA) regulator, which first publicly raised the alarm in a statement on July 5, told valsartan suppliers in a subsequent memo dated July 16 that the NDMA may have been connected to the combined use of the solvent dimethylformamide and sodium nitrite.","The FDA is also going on that hypothesis, said Janet Woodcock, director of its Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. She stressed the investigation was still going on.","“This (NDMA) was not what you look for in an inspection,” Woodcock said in an interview. “If you don’t test for this you’re not going to have an idea that it’s in there, and you’re not going to see it on an inspection.”","The European Directorate for the Quality of Medicines (EDQM), responsible for setting manufacturing standards, told Reuters it was aware the solvent was being used when it approved the changed process, but that NDMA as a by-product was unexpected and not tested for.","Detecting NDMA would have required gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, a very sensitive level of testing, an EDQM spokeswoman said.","“These techniques are not normally used routinely to test pharmaceutical products,” she said.","Built by Novartis into the $6 billion-a-year brand Diovan, valsartan’s European and U.S. patents expired in 2011 and 2012.","Global sales totaled 10.4 billion pills last year, including combination products, healthcare data consultancy IQVIA estimates. People with high blood pressure typically take one pill daily and heart failure patients two.","More than 50 companies around the world making finished tablets from the tainted valsartan have recalled products in recent weeks, according a Reuters analysis of national medicines agencies' records. They include major generic drug manufacturers such as Teva Pharmaceutical Industries TEVA.TA, Ranbaxy Laboratories and Sandoz.","Based on the average NDMA impurity detected at Huahai of 60 parts per million (ppm), the EMA says there could be one additional case of cancer in every 5,000 people taking the highest dose for seven years.","The contamination puts a spotlight on manufacturers in China and India, which supply more than two-thirds of all active pharmaceutical ingredients used in medicines, industry executives estimate. China accounts for the lion’s share.","Huahai, founded in 1989 and listed in Shanghai in 2003, was one of the first Chinese companies to get drugs approved in the U.S. market.","The FDA has inspected the site that made the contaminated valsartan three times since 2010, its records show. European inspectors also visited regularly.","The provincial branch of the Chinese FDA (CFDA) also inspected Huahai facilities 10 times in connection with new drug applications between January 2016 and June 2018, the national online database shows.",U.S. and European regulators have increased scrutiny of Chinese and Indian drug factories after the adulteration of the blood thinner heparin sickened hundreds and caused the deaths of at least 81 Americans in 2007 and 2008.,The CFDA is also on alert.,"Last month, it revealed that Changsheng Bio-technology 002680.SZ, a vaccine maker, had fabricated data and sold ineffective vaccines for children. It also found that a diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis vaccine sold by the state-owned Wuhan Institute of Biological Products was substandard.","The fact that international inspections do not appear to have detected the NDMA contamination alarms Anders Fuglsang, a former European medicines regulator who runs a pharmaceutical consultancy in Denmark.","“We need to ask ourselves how it is possible - despite pharmacopoeias and agency guidelines, inspection programs with coordination across continents, a system of public quality control, and companies complying with all rules - that a nasty carcinogen can find its way into our drugs and be there for years without anyone noticing,” he said."

Sales rose 4 percent in constant currencies to $12.7 billion, beating forecasts for $12.3 billion.","Narasimhan, who took over Feb. 1, has other reasons for encouragement.","His cancer drugs portfolio enjoyed 6 percent growth in the first three months of 2018, heart-failure drug Entresto sales finally hit $200 million, more than double a year ago, and Novartis’s resurgent Alcon eye care unit profited from demand for products like implantable lenses.","Alcon’s $1.8 billion sales, up 7 percent, beat analysts’ $1.6 billion forecast and could increase Novartis’s options as it considers spinning off the unit to shareholders to focus on prescription drugs.","A spin-off could come as early as first-half 2019, Novartis said.",He also announced that he had poached Amgen’s John Tsai as his new chief drug developer.,"Novartis is on track for 2018 core operating profit to rise by a mid-to-high single-digit percentage, it said.","Even so, Narasimhan, a U.S. citizen and Harvard-trained doctor, is not there yet: First-quarter core operating profit rose only 4 percent to $3.34 billion, so improvements are needed by year’s end, with Narasimhan saying Alcon performance, manufacturing cost cuts and rising Cosentyx and Entresto sales will drive that.","“We’ve made the big investments in Cosentyx and Entresto,” Narasimhan said. “As the sales grow, we expect the profit to flow down, and that should give us operating leverage over the latter part of the year.”","To start 2018, Narasimhan has been aggressively managing his portfolio, unloading a consumer health venture to GlaxoSmithKline and adding gene therapy hopeful AveXis for $8.7 billion.","Narasimhan said he remains on the hunt for bolt-on acquisitions, with deals ranging up to around $10 billion."
