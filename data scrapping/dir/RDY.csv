They will be able to control our pandemic in terms of the numbers of doses required.”","Paul said the government was also watching the progress of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, both of which have said interim results of last-stage trials of their candidates showed that they were more than 90% effective.","Unlike Pfizer’s vaccine which must be kept at minus 70 degrees Celsius or below, Moderna’s can be stored at normal fridge temperatures, making it more suited for poorer countries such as India where cold chains are limited.","“This obviously will be a very big hindrance to scale up the vaccine,” Paul said of Pfizer’s, adding that if India finds itself needing to do so it will pursue this option.","“If we are required to form our strategy on this particular vaccine, then we will proceed with it.

It tempered expectations for initial sales of Sublocade at the launch, saying it did not want investors to be unrealistic about its prospects in its first year.","The company stuck to its 2018 revenue guidance despite Dr. Reddy’s getting the go-ahead for its product launch, but said it would revisit the forecast if the move goes ahead.",Indivior is set to report first-half results on July 25. Jefferies analysts said reassurance from the company on the progress of Sublocade will be key to sentiment and share price support.
