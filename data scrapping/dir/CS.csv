Yet the need to avoid further expensive disasters at the bank undermines the chief executive’s previous strategy of boosting growth and returns. A major rethink under incoming Chairman António Horta-Osório is even more urgent than before.,"The twin collapses of clients Archegos Capital Management and Greensill Capital have made a mockery of the 21 billion Swiss franc bank’s risk management in recent months. Unveiling a pre-tax loss of 757 million Swiss francs for the first quarter on Thursday, Gottstein started the cleanup operation.","To start with, he’s hiking capital by issuing bonds which convert into shares after six months. That should raise about 1.7 billion Swiss francs, helping to lift the bank’s common equity Tier 1 capital ratio towards 13% from 12.2% at the end of March. Second, Gottstein is shrinking the unit that services hedge funds, which lost 4.4 billion Swiss francs on Archegos, and launching a “group-wide review of risk positions”.","Both steps are necessary to restore investor confidence after Credit Suisse shares fell by a third in less than two months. The problem is that dialing down risk-taking is at odds with Gottstein’s strategy of growing his way towards higher returns. That plan, which he outlined in December, involved boosting pre-tax profit in the lender’s Asian wealth management unit and doubling down on investment banking strengths like structured credit. It’s hard now to see Credit Suisse’s traders, bankers and wealth advisers getting the go-ahead to aggressively chase business.","That sharpens an existing dilemma. Credit Suisse has a relatively high level of capital as a proportion of its total assets, partly because international Basel standards judge its exposures to be comparatively risky. Risk-weighted assets were 36% of total assets on March 31, compared with 26% for cross-town rival UBS (UBSG.S) at the end of 2020. To hit the same return on regulatory capital, Credit Suisse must therefore earn a higher overall yield on its total asset base. This usually means placing bigger bets.",But Gottstein may now end up carrying more capital than before while also taking less risk. Resolving that dilemma looks tricky. Shedding investment banking assets would boost returns over time but may be costly in the short term.

Many lenders continued to make generous payouts in 2009, even though taxpayers had just bailed them out. Credit Suisse (CSGN.S) Chief Executive Thomas Gottstein may take a different tack out of necessity. It could serve as an overdue test of the market for bank talent.","The Swiss bank set aside less than usual for bonuses in the first quarter, the Financial Times reported on Monday. That helped add about $600 million to its pre-tax profit, buffering the near-$5 billion hit from the collapse of hedge fund Archegos. Roaring markets and a boom in special purpose acquisition companies also contributed. As a result, Credit Suisse’s first-quarter loss will be less than $1 billion.","Gottstein had little choice. Even with the bonus savings, Credit Suisse’s common equity Tier 1 capital ratio will probably dip below 12.5%. With a further possible hit pending from funds linked to bankrupt supply chain financier Greensill, which have $2.3 billion of exposure to three particularly dicey clients, the bank was in danger of needing to raise capital. Gottstein could also still reverse course. Banks accrue payments for future bonuses each quarter but don’t pay them out until the end of the year. Credit Suisse could in theory make up for lost time if it performs well.","Still, pay restraint would serve as a useful experiment. The old argument is that banks need to keep paying star traders and rainmakers, even during a crisis, to ensure they have a competitive franchise. Credit Suisse’s SPAC bankers, who topped the global league tables for blank-cheque companies in 2020 according to Refinitiv, could jump ship to a rival. A probable risk clampdown at Credit Suisse, and higher capital charges, may prompt traders to head for the exit.","Yet the market for investment banking is hardly roaring.

The outgoing Lloyds Banking Group chief executive, who joins the Zurich-based lender in May, could rescue some value with radical surgery.","Horta-Osório is already in contact with Chief Executive Thomas Gottstein over the twin crises engulfing Credit Suisse. First is Archegos Capital Management, a hedge fund that defaulted on margin calls last week. Credit Suisse may also take losses on loans in funds linked to collapsed financier Greensill Capital.","Though the size of the double hit is unclear, investors wiped 23% off Credit Suisse’s shares in March – equivalent to 7.2 billion Swiss francs ($7.9 billion) of losses. That scale of a blow could push the bank’s common equity Tier 1 capital ratio as low as 10.7% according to a Breakingviews calculation, below its 12.5% target. It might need to suspend dividends and buybacks or even raise capital.","The crisis should, however, trigger long-overdue reforms. Credit Suisse’s collection of businesses, many of which have scant relevance to the private banking core, trade at a huge discount to the sum of their parts. Even assuming the investment bank has no value, the remaining private bank, Swiss unit, asset management and Asia divisions could between them be worth 35 billion Swiss francs – 41% above the current market capitalisation. That’s according to a Breakingviews calculation using 2022 consensus estimates and rivals’ price-earnings multiples.","Reining in the traders is the first step. Even before the Archegos crisis, the investment bank only made an average return on capital of 9% over the last three years. Exiting the business completely would be difficult, so Horta-Osório’s best bet is to shrink it massively. That means cutting exposure to prime broking and debt trading, which mesh poorly with the core private bank.","Horta-Osório’s next step should be to revive a much-touted listing of the domestic Swiss business. That could be worth 15 billion Swiss francs on the average 9.7 times 2022 earnings multiple for European banks. Lastly, the asset management unit remains sub-scale. Selling that to peers like UBS or Deutsche Bank would raise 3 billion Swiss francs.","Those moves would reduce the discount at which Credit Suisse trades, and leave a leaner company focused on private banking, with exposure to fast-growing Asia.

Nomura shares closed down 16.3%, a record one-day drop, while Credit Suisse shares tumbled 14%, their biggest fall in a year. Deutsche Bank dropped 5% and UBS was off 3.8%.","Losses at Archegos Capital Management, a family office run by former Tiger Asia manager Bill Hwang, sparked a fire sale of stocks including ViacomCBS and Discovery on Friday, a source familiar with the matter said.","“This is a challenging time for the family office of Archegos Capital Management, our partners and employees,” company spokesperson Karen Kessler said in a statement. “All plans are being discussed as Mr. Hwang and the team determine the best path forward.”","Archegos was unable to meet banks’ calls for more collateral to secure equity swap trades they had partly financed. After those positions fell sharply in value, lenders sold big blocks of securities to recoup what they were owed, the sources said.","“When you have people making certain bets based on what has outperformed in the past and the tide turns they get burned. The question is how much leverage they used,” said Richard Bernstein, chief executive of Richard Bernstein Advisors.","The problems started last week when a disappointing stock sale by media giant ViacomCBS triggered devastating bank margin calls for Archegos, three sources familiar with the matter said on Monday.","Shares in ViacomCBS fell 23% last Wednesday after the media company sold shares at a price which diluted its value. While stocks typically decline after share sales, ViacomCBS was also hurt by analyst downgrades concerned its stock had become over-valued.","ViacomCBS’s shares extended their declines on Thursday to be down 30% from the previous Monday’s close, setting off alarm bells at Archegos’ prime brokers and prompting them to offload stock in all of Archegos’ investments.","Goldman and Morgan Stanley were quick to offload shares on Friday, averting a material financial impact, sources familiar with the trades said.","Deutsche Bank said it had significantly de-risked its Archegos exposure without incurring any losses and was managing down its “immaterial remaining client positions,” on which it did not expect to incur a loss.","However, other banks faced more serious repercussions.","Nomura, Japan’s largest investment bank, warned of a possible $2 billion loss, while Credit Suisse said a default on margin calls by a U.S.-based fund could be “highly significant and material” to its first-quarter results. The banks did not identify the fund.","Credit Suisse’s losses were likely to be at least $1 billion, two sources said. The losses could reach $4 billion, a figure, one source said. Credit Suisse declined to comment on loss estimates.",Investors questioned if the full impact of Archegos’ problem had been realized.,"Market observers noted that only in February, hedge funds took major losses on short positions during the run-up in GameStop Corp stock. Hedge fund de-leveraging also contributed toward turmoil in the U.S. Treasuries market in March 2020.","In the case of Archegos, the opaque and complex nature of its derivative trades, lightly regulated structure as a family office and high leverage - fueled by historically low interest rates - prompted concern about potential systemic risk.","Regulators in the United States, UK, Switzerland and Japan said they were closely monitoring developments.","Archegos bought derivatives known as total return swaps, which allow investors to bet on stock price moves without owning the underlying securities, according to one source familiar with the trades. The fund posts collateral against the securities rather than buying them outright with cash.","Archegos’ positions were highly leveraged. The firm had assets of around $10 billion but held positions worth more than $50 billion, according to the source who declined to be identified.","Thomas Hayes, chairman of Great Hill Capital LLC in New York, said Hwang was known to run “a very concentrated, highly leveraged book.”","The underlying shares were held by Archegos’ prime brokers, which lent it money and structured and processed its trades. They included Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Deutsche Bank, Credit Suisse and Nomura.","Unwinding the positions led banks to sell large blocks of stock. Shares of ViacomCBS and Discovery each tumbled around 27% on Friday, while U.S.-listed shares of China-based Baidu and Tencent Music plunged as much as 33.5% and 48.5% last week.","Other stocks caught up in Archegos-related liquidations included Baidu Inc, Tencent Music Entertainment Group, Vipshop Holdings Ltd, Farfetch Ltd, iQIYI Inc and GSX Techedu Inc.","Hwang, who ran Tiger Asia from 2001 to 2012, renamed the hedge fund Archegos Capital and converted it to a family office, according to a page capture of the fund’s website. Family offices act as private wealth managers and have lower disclosure requirements than other investment companies.","Hedge fund managers said they wondered why Hwang, whom several described as a “smart guy,” had made such big bets on ViacomCBS and Discovery, given the large wagers against the companies. The pair are not seen as high-growth plays, in contrast to other media stocks that have outperformed during the COVID-19 pandemic, the sources said.",Hwang and his firm in 2012 paid $44 million to settle Securities and Exchange Commission insider trading charges.

It looks like it may have been as high as 10:1 leverage.","“The Viacom trade was brilliant. The stock was at all-time highs, it was completely over overvalued in the short term and they said ‘OK, let’s sell the stock.’ Smart cookie. That was the right thing to do. It was dilutive, an analyst downgraded it, the stock came down a little bit and that caused one of Archegos’ prime brokers to do a margin call and that gets around the Street pretty quick.","“(Hwang) had in his concentrated book quite a few U.S.-listed Chinese stocks. Like BIDU (Baidu Inc) like IQ (iQIYI Inc), like TME (Tencent Music Entertainment Group) and that’s worrisome because of what happened with China National Oil Co and China Mobile Ltd when they got delisted effectively overnight. The stocks dropped because people couldn’t get out of them.","“In the U.S. people are a little worried about the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act that was signed in December. While it seems they’ll have a couple years to comply or get delisted, things can trigger pre-eminent listings and the previous administration had warned larger pensions to get out of U.S.-Chinese listed stocks, so you don’t want to be caught holding the bag.","“It was a confluence of several events compounded by the recent sell-off and weakness in the tech sector, which most hedge funds are leveraged to. It’s likely a confined event but you never know going into quarter-end, weird stuff can happen with rebalancing, with funds that are maybe over leveraged. Maybe some of these funds want to take a number of these Chinese stocks off the book.”","RICK MECKLER, PARTNER, CHERRY LANE INVESTMENTS, A FAMILY INVESTMENT OFFICE IN NEW VERNON, NEW JERSEY","“It’s reflective of some of the excesses the market has seen over the last month with wild gyrations in some specific stocks without much explanation. This certainly explains the trading in VIAB and Discover and some of the Chinese issues. It’s a black eye for the industry because it suggests that the problems that they had over 10 years ago now, there still may not be a full handle on risk control when it comes to leveraged trading.”",“It’s effect on the broad market is probably pretty limited. It doesn’t change much about the economy or it doesn’t impact a vast majority of U.S. stocks.

After the 2008 crash, the bank paid bosses’ bonuses in instruments linked to risky assets acquired during the preceding boom. Reviving the Partner Asset Facility (PAF) offers a way to share the pain with investors in funds linked to the collapsed supply-chain financier.","The funds, which had about $10 billion of assets when they were suspended at the start of March, contain $3 billion of dodgy loans, the Financial Times reported on Thursday. The lion’s share are owed by steel magnate Sanjeev Gupta’s GFG Alliance and coal miner Bluestone Resources. Credit Suisse expects actual losses, after factoring in recoveries and insurance payouts, may be as low as $1 billion.","It’s a thorny dilemma for Chief Executive Thomas Gottstein. Doing nothing would mean passing the losses to fund investors who could in theory get back just 70 cents to 90 cents on the dollar. That risks souring relationships with important corporate and wealthy clients, who thought they were buying a cash-like product. Inevitable lawsuits mean any recovery could take years.","That’s why the bank may shoulder 50% of the burden, Reuters reported on Thursday. Absorbing half of the potential $1 billion to $3 billion of losses could knock 17 basis points to 51 basis points off its common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, which stood at 12.9% at the end of December. The problem with that plan is that supervisor FINMA may also force Gottstein to hold more equity against future missteps.","There’s a third way: make Credit Suisse’s senior staff eat their own cooking. A PAF-style vehicle could buy troubled assets from the fund’s investors. Executive board members and senior managers in the asset and wealth management businesses would receive units in the PAF fund in lieu of bonus payments, effectively landing them with the risk that credit insurers which insured the Greensill assets refuse to pay out.","Another option would be to structure cash flows from the dodgy assets like collateralised loan obligations – a specialism of Credit Suisse’s bankers. Fund investors would have first dibs on any recoveries, with the riskier tranches held by the bank and its high-ranking employees. Aside from the pleasing karma of such an arrangement, it might smooth relations with angry fund investors. Credit Suisse’s structured finance nerds have a shot at retribution."

His efforts might not be enough to reassure clients of his asset management business, which is winding down $10 billion of funds linked to the collapsed supply-chain financier. Fierce industry pressures strengthen the case for selling it to a rival like UBS.","Barely a year into his tenure at the helm of the Zurich-based bank, Gottstein on Thursday said he would separate the asset management division, which oversees $477 billion, from the wider wealth-management business. Ulrich Koerner, who previously ran the equivalent division of UBS, will take charge. Outgoing boss Eric Varvel will focus on his other roles at Credit Suisse.","Koerner’s immediate challenge is reassuring asset management clients spooked by risk-management issues highlighted by the Greensill episode. Though Credit Suisse has already returned $3.1 billion to investors in the four funds, the bank’s annual report on Thursday said there was still “considerable uncertainty” over how much of the remaining $7 billion they will get back. Some of the trade-finance notes sourced by Greensill will not be repaid. Meanwhile credit insurers may resist stumping up for losses.","The saga strikes at the heart of Credit Suisse’s asset management growth strategy, which involved persuading clients to buy higher-margin alternative investments rather than traditional equity and bond funds. Varvel recently boasted that products like leveraged loans and the supply-chain funds accounted for 75% of the core fund management division’s revenue growth between 2016 and 2019. A key source of future growth, he explained, was winning more business through Credit Suisse’s private banking unit. Referrals from wealthy individuals and families accounted for only around 15% of assets at Credit Suisse’s funds business in September.","The Greensill disaster casts doubt over both parts of that strategy. Throw in the industry-wide pressure on fees, driven by the popularity of low-cost passive funds, and the case for Credit Suisse continuing to own its asset management business is weaker than before. A combination with cross-town rival UBS could yield $284 million of annual cost savings, Deutsche Bank analysts have estimated.","Appointing a heavy hitter to run the business suggests selling is not on Gottstein’s agenda. But if Koerner’s cleanup fails to deliver viable results while avoiding scandals, the question will be back on the CEO’s desk before long."

Now Greensill Capital has demonstrated how sharing clients between asset management, wealth and lending units can also increase risks. Though the financial hit from the supply-chain lender’s collapse looks manageable for Credit Suisse Chief Executive Thomas Gottstein, it exposes one downside of his strategy.","The scandal affects almost every division of the Zurich-based bank. Credit Suisse Asset Management oversaw $10 billion of funds that invested in Greensill’s trade-finance assets. Founder Lex Greensill was a private bank client. Meanwhile Gottstein’s investment bankers advised the SoftBank Group-backed company on a planned capital raise, and the bank lent it $140 million.","The relationship leaves Credit Suisse facing setbacks on several fronts. Start with the asset-management unit, which precipitated Greensill’s collapse when it froze its funds last week. Assets in three of the four funds are covered by credit insurance, leaving investors directly exposed to $1.8 billion. Strip out cash and loans to relatively safe borrowers, and there’s about $400 million of junk-rated exposure that could go bad. Though Credit Suisse is not liable for fund losses, Gottstein might have to cover them to avoid investor ire and lawsuits.","Then there’s the loan to Greensill. Credit Suisse is confident of recovering the credit, which according to a person familiar with the matter is secured against cash and trade receivables on Greensill’s balance sheet. Conservatively assume the bank writes off half of it, or $70 million. Add that to the potential fund losses, and the total hit would be $470 million, equivalent to just 0.16 percentage points off the bank’s Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio. Gottstein’s headache would get much worse, however, if Greensill’s credit insurance fails to pay out. Japan’s Tokio Marine, the main owner of the policies, on Wednesday told the Financial Times that it was studying whether they were valid.","Whatever the financial outcome, the episode exposes deeper problems. Persuading the bank’s different business lines to work in tandem is laudable, but also makes it more sensitive to failures. Credit Suisse has been embroiled in a few of these recently, including German payments processor Wirecard and China’s collapsed Luckin Coffee, whose Chairman Charles Zhengyao Lu was a wealth-management client.","Gottstein is doubling down on cross-business collaboration to hit his ambitious growth targets. Christian Meissner, a former Bank of America rainmaker, joined last year with a brief to help strengthen ties between the investment bank and wealth management. That’s long been the holy grail for Credit Suisse CEOs. Greensill shows it has a dark side."

His eponymous supply-chain finance group suffered a blow on Monday when Credit Suisse suspended $10 billion of funds backed by assets the SoftBank-backed group had created for it. The question now is who will fill the funding gap for the company’s products and its clients, like steel magnate Sanjeev Gupta.","Greensill, whose advisers include former British Prime Minister David Cameron, added rocket fuel to the humdrum business of invoice discounting. That’s where banks provide funding to companies by paying their suppliers early, allowing the borrower to spread payments over time. Instead of just keeping the invoices on its balance sheet, Greensill would package up claims into bonds, and sell them through vehicles like the Credit Suisse Asset Management’s supply-chain funds, which were placed with cash-rich companies and other investors. Greensill arranged $143 billion of financing in 2019.","Credit Suisse has now frozen redemptions on its four funds which sourced their assets through Greensill, citing “considerable uncertainties with respect to their accurate valuation”. The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that the Swiss bank was worried about the funds’ exposure to industrialist Gupta, whose sprawling GFG Alliance empire has borrowed heavily through Greensill.","Greensill’s first issue seems to be overconcentration of risk in a single credit, although the Credit Suisse funds do not disclose how much Gupta-linked debt they hold. German regulator BaFin has also pushed Greensill to reduce its exposures to the industrialist, made through a local Greensill-controlled bank, the Financial Times says. The second problem was channelling relatively risk-averse investors’ cash into esoteric assets that aren’t publicly traded. One of the Credit Suisse funds targeted a low 0.8% return above three-month LIBOR and touted a “short term maturity profile”. Now its investors are stuck because Credit Suisse can’t work out what the assets are worth.","The risk for Greensill, and its clients like Gupta, is that such cheap, short-term funding now becomes scarcer, or more expensive. Alternative potential backers may expect higher returns to compensate for the risks, hurting future growth. Bloomberg reported on Monday that SoftBank was considering writing down the value of its equity investment in Greensill to almost zero. The supply-chain finance revolution may have run its course."

They consume about two-fifths of Credit Suisse’s risk-weighted assets, UBS analysts reckon, compared with one-third at the bigger Swiss bank.","The new plan offers hope. Merging investment banking and trading, and folding in the Asian trading operations, will boost transparency. It would make sense for Gottstein to focus cost cuts on businesses offering debt, equity and M&A advice: they had a higher cost base last year than in 2015, after stripping out one-offs. Finally, his ambition to allocate two-thirds of capital to wealth management over time means sidelining capital-intensive trading operations.","There’s still scope to improve. Gottstein wants to reinvest his savings, whereas shareholders might prefer to receive them in the form of buybacks or dividends. But it’s a step in the right direction. Credit Suisse would be worth 45% more than its current 23.1 billion franc market capitalisation if the lender were to trade on UBS’s multiple of tangible book value. Imitation looks like the surest route to riches."
