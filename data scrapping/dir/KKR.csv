The Nashville, Tennessee-based company’s doctors are needed more than ever as the number of COVID-19 cases soars. Yet its revenue has collapsed as patients who have not contracted the virus are avoiding elective procedures and are staying clear of emergency rooms for fear of being infected.","Envision has hired investment bank Houlihan Lokey Inc HLI.N to explore a range of debt restructuring options, according to the sources. Envision's recent offer to creditors to exchange some of its bonds with loan borrowings will not be enough to keep the company afloat, the sources said. The healthcare services provider will have to make more significant cuts to its debt, the sources added.","The sources cautioned that no decision on a course of action had yet been taken and asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Envision, KKR and Houlihan Lokey declined to comment.","The novel coronavirus, which first broke out in the Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019, has infected more than 1.4 million people around the world, killing more than 87,700. In the United States, the number of those infected topped 459,000 on Thursday, with deaths soaring to more than 16,400.","Elective surgeries that Envision provides are among the most lucrative medical procedures, while intensive care, which COVID-19 patients require, is far more expensive. Envision’s business of staffing emergency rooms has also suffered because it gets compensated per visit rather than for the time patients spent there. As a result, the typical two-week period that many COVID-19 patients spend in intensive care is a further drag on Envision’s revenue.","Moreover, it not just the non-COVID-19 patients who are avoiding hospital treatment when possible. Acute care hospitals are postponing non-essential elective surgical procedures to make room for COVID-19 patients. Ambulatory surgery centers are doing the same on the advice of health officials and to conserve surgical supplies, such as personal protective equipment.","Envision said this week that patient volumes are down by as much as 70% in its ambulatory surgery and anesthesia services since the onset of the pandemic, while emergency room visits are down by 30%.","The company also said that it would cut senior staffers’ salaries by 50%, reduce doctors’ pay in areas where patient visits are down, and furlough non-clinical workers.","A portion of Envision’s roughly $5 billion term loan was trading at 60 cents on the dollar this week, according to Refinitiv Eikon data, indicating investor concerns about being paid back in full.","The $2 trillion coronavirus stimulus package approved by Congress includes a $100 billion relief fund to reimburse medical providers. However, many large doctors’ groups such as Envision, which has more than 25,000 physicians, anesthesiologists and other medical staff, are not eligible for aid. The only relief Envision has secured so far is a three-month advance on Medicare fee-for-service payments, which has made little difference to its finances, according to one of the sources.","“The ongoing spread of the coronavirus will make it increasingly challenging for Envision to manage its labor costs, sustain consistent revenue cycle management, and maintain subsidies that it receives from hospitals,” credit ratings agency Moody’s Investors Service Inc said this week.","Much of Envision's debt is the legacy of KKR's $9.9 billion leveraged buyout of the company in 2018. Its rival, TeamHealth Inc, which is owned by private equity firm Blackstone Group Inc BX.N, has also been hit by a severe decline in revenue and cash flow, according to Moody's.","Envision provides medical staff to more than 1,800 clinical departments in healthcare facilities in 45 states and the District of Columbia. It also owns and operates 257 surgery centers and one surgical hospital in 35 states and the District of Columbia.","The company faced financial threats even before the emergence of the pandemic. U.S. lawmakers are considering proposals that would reduce reimbursement that Envision collects on out-of-network claims. Some patients have criticized it for so-called “surprise billing,” after unknowingly seeing a doctor who was not covered by their health insurance, even though the visit may have occurred in an in-network facility.","In February, Envision replaced its chief executive officer Chris Holden with healthcare services company OptumCare president James Rechtin. The company said this week said it would deploy a total of 200 doctors to the Mount Sinai Health System and nearby hospitals in New York to help with the coronavirus crisis."

KKR last year raised $9.3 billion - a regional record - in its third Asia-focused buyout fund.","MYOB disclosed the proposal in a statement and said its board was studying the non-binding offer, which was conditional on KKR obtaining financing for the deal and getting a unanimous recommendation from the target’s directors.","A spokeswoman for KKR confirmed the A$3.7 per share offer for the remaining 80.1 percent of the company, and declined to comment further. The offer price, a premium of 24 percent to MYOB’s last closing price, values it at A$2.18 billion.","In building its stake, KKR paid A$327 million to buy 17 percent of MYOB from its biggest shareholder, an affiliate of private equity firm Bain Capital, leaving the affiliate with a 6.1 percent stake, MYOB said.","MYOB shares soared by over a fifth to A$3.6, their highest intraday price in almost nine months, after news of the unsolicited offer. But they stayed below the KKR offer price, indicating investors did not think a higher counteroffer was on the anvil. They closed at A$3.55.","“With 19.9 percent of the register, KKR effectively own a blocking stake in the company. We think this could be enough of a deterrent for a potential interloper,” JPMorgan analysts said in a note.","MYOB did not specify if Bain, which acquired the then privately owned MYOB in 2011 and listed it in 2015, was endorsing KKR’s takeover offer, and a spokesman for Bain did not return calls seeking comment.","Once the dominant provider of accounting software to small and medium-sized businesses in Australia, MYOB has in recent years struggled to compete for market share with cloud-based administrative software company Xero Ltd XRO.AX.","Together they service more than 80 percent of the local market, according to Wilsons Equity Research, though the research also showed Xero’s growth has outpaced MYOB’s. Xero’s market value, at around A$6.88 billion, is more than thrice MYOB’s.","JPMorgan analysts said KKR's stake would make it hard for strategic investors such as Sage Group SGE.L, which had attempted to buy MYOB back in 2011, and American peer Intuit Inc.INTU.O, maker of popular software QuickBooks, to rival KKR's bid.",An Australian-based spokeswoman for Intuit said it did not comment on market speculation. Spokespeople for Sage did not return an email seeking comment outside of office hours.,"The proposed deal comes after KKR acquired U.S. business software company BMC Software in May in its largest deal since the 2008 financial crisis, underscoring how deal sizes are growing bigger again as private equity seeks to put a record $1 trillion of unused investor money to work.","For KKR, the more than A$2 billion price tag for MYOB would make it one of its largest takeovers in Australia. Its first foray in the country was a A$1.83 billion acquisition of Brambles Industries’ waste management and industrial services businesses.","Last year, KKR bought Australian non-bank lender Pepper Group for about A$682 million."
