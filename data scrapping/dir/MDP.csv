Meredith reported earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $223 million for its local media group for the 2018 fiscal year.","The sources, who asked not to be named because the matter is confidential, cautioned that no deal is certain.","Apollo and Meredith, which had a market capitalization of $2.62 billion on Wednesday, both declined to comment.","The divestment would come after Meredith acquired media company Time Inc last year for $2.8 billion, in a deal that built out its suite of national print and digital media brands.","Since the acquisition, Meredith has moved to simplify its business and focus on its most profitable media properties. It has already sold off its Time and Fortune magazines, and has also been trying to sell Sports Illustrated.","A sale of its broadcasting business would leave Des Moines, Iowa-based Meredith with just its digital and print media business, which targets primarily women and focuses on topics including food, lifestyle and parenting.","Meredith’s stations, which are mostly affiliates of Fox Corp or CBS Corp, reach 11 percent of U.S. households in cities such as Portland, Oregon and Las Vegas.","It a deal is completed, it would be the latest in a flurry of consolidation that has hit local broadcasting in recent years.","Broadcast television operators are looking to either gain scale or exit the space as viewership, and advertising dollars, increasingly shift to providers of web-based, streaming content.","Meanwhile, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission is expected to relax restrictions on how many stations broadcasters can operate, a move that could further boost dealmaking.","Apollo in February agreed to acquire a majority stake in 14 television stations from privately held Cox Media Group, which set it up to become a player in broadcasting. Reuters reported that the transaction was valued at around $3 billion.","Apollo has been on the prowl for more assets to build up its portfolio. Earlier this week, it lost out on a deal when Nexstar Media Group Inc agreed to sell 19 television stations to Tegna Inc and E.W.

It has already sold off its Time and Fortune magazines and is exploring a sale of Money Magazine.","Bridgeman is in the final stages of negotiating a deal for Sports Illustrated after lining up acquisition financing, the sources added. If his effort is successful, a deal announcement could come by the end of the year, according to the sources.","One aspect of the deal still being hashed out in the negotiations is the outsourcing agreements related to printing and paper costs of the magazine, one of the sources said. These discussions are common when a buyer who does not own a media company purchases a magazine, the source added.","For example, when Marc and Lynne Benioff bought Time magazine for $190 million in cash in September, Meredith entered into a multiyear agreement with them to provide services such as subscription fulfillment, paper purchasing and printing.",The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Bridgeman and Meredith declined to comment.

Earlier this year, Marc Benioff, founder of Salesforce.com CRM.N, bought Time Magazine from Meredith for $190 million. Chatchaval Jiaravanon, a Thai businessman, bought Fortune for $150 million.","Meredith, which owns lifestyle magazines such as Better Homes & Gardens and Family Circle, also said it would cut more than 1,000 jobs in the wake of the merger. The sale of Sports Illustrated would further Meredith’s push to streamline its business by shedding brands that have less appeal to its core readership, which is predominantly female.","First published in 1954, Sports Illustrated is a U.S. magazine brand best known for its annual swimsuit issue. It has nearly 3 million subscribers but has been scaling back in recent years, reducing its print edition to 24 issues annually, in the face of pressure from online media.","With its roots in traditional publishing, Meredith has been facing a fierce competitive online race against internet giants such as Alphabet Inc’s GOOGL.O Google and Facebook Inc FB.O for consumer eyeballs and advertising dollars.","Bridgeman played for the Milwaukee Bucks and the Los Angeles Clippers during his career with the National Basketball Association, which ran from 1975 to 1987.
