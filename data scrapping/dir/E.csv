But for Eni, which has said its oil output will start tapering off after 2025, the JV model offers a way to cut costs and squeeze more money out of the oil and gas division.","Eni, headed by veteran oilman Claudio Descalzi, is also mulling spinning off its new retail and renewable energy business next year in order to raise funds. It could list a minority stake in a unit that could be worth around 10 billion euros, according to sources.","Like its peers, Eni has set ambitious targets to slash planet-warming emissions to net-zero by 2050 while rapidly expanding its renewable power generation and biofuel capacity.","The joint ventures model offers companies a way to build a new low-carbon business centred around renewables, power trading and retail, while jettisoning legacy oil and gas businesses which will be wound down over time, a senior source close to Eni said.","The new model also offers transparency to investors regarding greenhouse gas emissions, he added.","""If you still co-own the new company you're still liable for the emissions.

Last year, Egypt exported more than 3 million tonnes of LNG, up from 1.5 million tonnes in 2018 and 850,000 tonnes in 2017.","The Damietta plant was 80% owned by Union Fenosa Gas (UFG), the joint venture between Eni and Naturgy, with the rest split evenly between the Egyptian Natural Gas Holding Company (EGAS) and Egyptian General Petroleum Corporation (EGPC).","Under Thursday’s agreement, the plant will now be 50% owned by Eni, 40% by EGAS and 10% by EGPC.","Eni, the biggest foreign oil and gas producer Libya, discovered Egypt’s biggest-ever gas field Zohr in 2015 and has a series of other assets in the Mediterranean.","It will take over the contract for the purchase of natural gas for the Damietta plant and secure corresponding liquefaction rights, increasing its LNG portfolio by 3.78 billion cubic metres per year.","Eni, like other majors, is looking to decarbonise its business activities and sees LNG and gas as important resources in that transition.","Naturgy, meanwhile, hailed the agreement as a positive step in its plan to reduce its exposure to gas procurement contracts. LNG prices are trading at multi-year lows.","The Spanish firm will also pocket $600 million in cash and most of UFG’s $300 million-worth of assets outside Egypt, not including its Spanish business.","Since a management reshuffle in 2018, Naturgy has focused on cutting costs and moving out of countries including Colombia, Italy, Moldova and South Africa.","Eni said it would take over UFG’s marketing of natural gas in Spain, bolstering its presence in the European gas market.

Descalzi denies any wrongdoing.","However, Rome is keen for an experienced leader with a track record of dealing with geopolitically sensitive areas such as Africa and the Middle East to oversee interests there, and to help Eni ENI.MI shift toward cleaner sources of energy without inflicting too much damage on profitability.","“No final decision has been made yet, but Descalzi has a good chance to be reappointed,” a government member of the ruling center-left Democratic Party (PD) said, asking not to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter.","Eni, a rich source of dividends for stretched state coffers, has traditionally been seen as a key piece of Italy’s energy policy and also important for foreign policy because of its extensive overseas presence.",Descalzi’s second term leading the company comes to an end in May and the government is expected to flag as soon as March whether or not he will be kept on. The 64-year old executive is due to present Eni’s latest business plan on Feb. 28.,"Economy Minister Roberto Gualtieri, a PD minister, said on Friday that ""very valuable people"" were running state-owned companies, which also include utility giant Enel ENEI.MI and defense group Leonardo LDOF.MI, but did not elaborate.","The 5-Star Movement is not opposing Descalzi’s reappointment as long as he is prepared to work with a new board to accelerate moves to cut carbon emissions, a prominent member of the movement said.","“He is winning round key figures in the party,” the official said, also asking not to be named.",The nomination process at Italy’s state-controlled companies is traditionally the subject of intense political horse trading because of their size and importance.

He has shunned costly bets on North American shale gas and more recently won accolades from investors by signing a flurry of deals in the Gulf.","However, his leadership has not been without controversy.","In one of the oil industry's biggest ever scandals, Italian prosecutors allege Eni and Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L bought a Nigerian oilfield in 2011 knowing most of the $1.3 billion purchase price would go to agents and middlemen in bribes.","The trial, which includes Descalzi because he led Eni’s exploration and production business at the time of the transaction, is drawing to a close, but is not expected to conclude until after the nomination process for a new CEO.","Eni and Shell, like Descalzi, have denied wrongdoing.","Despite the allegations, two of the sources said Rome was drawn to keeping Descalzi as a steady pair of hands at a time of increasing turmoil in Libya, where Eni is the biggest foreign oil and gas producer. “The (Italian) government at the moment is weak and the message coming out of Rome is to rock the boat as little as possible,” one of them said.",Descalzi’s experience could also help Eni meet growing pressure from politicians and investors for oil companies to do more to address global warming.,"The CEO, a physicist by training, set up Eni’s green energy unit in 2015 and introduced a target for net-zero carbon emissions from exploration and production operations by 2030.","However, rivals such as Repsol REP.MC, Shell RDSa.L and, more recently, BP BP.L, have gone further, and Descalzi is under pressure to set bolder targets.","“He’s got the ball rolling but now he’s got to raise the bar,” one of the sources said."

It is alleged that about $1.1 billion of the total was siphoned to agents and middlemen.,"The Milan judge made the comment in her written reasons for the September conviction of Obi and Italian Gianluca Di Nardo, both middlemen in the OPL 245 deal, for corruption. The pair were jailed for four years.","Obi and Di Nardo have been tried separately from Eni and Shell, which also face corruption allegations over the same deal in a hearing that is expected to drag on for months.",Obi brought the Swiss case to keep the contents of the suitcase - seized in Geneva in April 2016 in an inquiry unrelated to the corruption case - from being shared with foreign authorities.,"Its confiscation led Geneva prosecutors to open a criminal case for suspected corruption of foreign officials and money-laundering.

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo discussed it with Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi twice in three days, including during a surprise visit to Baghdad. Abdul Mahdi, meanwhile, said Iraq was close to signing the agreement with the American company and its venture partner PetroChina.","But negotiations subsequently became protracted over contract conditions and escalating tensions between Iraq’s bigger neighbor Iran and the United States, Baghdad’s two main allies.","Talks to reach at least an initial agreement were held up by two separate evacuations of Exxon’s foreign staff from Iraq, the first after Washington warned of Iranian threats to U.S. interests there, and the second prompted by a rocket attack that appeared to target the company.",The five senior Iraqi oil officials said the delays had forced Iraq to consider other companies to help construct infrastructure for its offshore export terminals.,"“We can’t wait for Exxon forever. We have serious problems with our sea pipelines and urgently need to find partners to help build new ones. Further delays could harm our sea export infrastructure,” said one of the officials, who oversees export infrastructure in the south of the country.","The project that Iraq is discussing with BP and Eni involves the replacement of two old seabed pipelines, including an idled one which transports crude to the Khor al-Amaya terminal.","Loading operations have been halted at Khor al-Amaya since 2017 when the pipeline suffered ruptures and leakages and had to be shut, oil officials said. The other pipeline is operating at partial capacity to ship crude oil to the Basra offshore terminal.","Under the proposed deal, BP would finance the project and Eni would handle the procurement, engineering and construction tendering aspects, the sources said.",The negotiations are in their final stages after the parties worked out a mechanism to allow the British company to recover its financing payments.,"“In principle we agreed BP could recover its payments by taking oil shipments instead of cash, just like the mechanism we’re following to pay the company to develop Rumaila oilfields,” said one of the Iraqi officials.","Eni will be paid in cash for its work, the officials said.","The seawater injection project, which Hyundai has been selected for, was also originally part of Exxon’s planned deal to develop Iraq’s southern energy installations.","Iraq has no major water injection plant and needs one for its wells or would risk losing pressure and face severe production decline, especially at its mature oilfields. As freshwater is a scarce resource in Iraq, using treated seawater is one of the best alternatives.","Three of the oil officials said Exxon had costed the project at higher than Hyundai’s $2.4 billion. They said other parts of the proposed Exxon project could go to other companies if they offered lower costs, including a project to build additional crude storage.","The Hyundai deal, announced by the state-run Basra Oil Co, still requires the final approval of the oil ministry.

He said Eni had signed a deal giving it the right to use the project’s intellectual property.","“The eventual stake we’ll have in the company will be decided when there is an overall investment agreement, depending also on how much they will raise,” Casula said.","The MIT project is vying with research teams in France, China and Britain to develop a reactor that can generate more energy than the enormous amount that fusion consumes, and can also safely contain a mass of super-hot gases or plasma.","Italy also recently entered the race, though Eni is sticking with MIT, saying the Boston project is unique in its aim to produce electricity, while others have scientific objectives.","All projects are based on a system known as tokamak, which uses superconducting magnets to hold the plasma at temperatures of up to 100 million degrees, suspending it inside a vacuum chamber without it touching the chamber’s walls.","To make electricity, heat produced by the fusion of hydrogen isotopes is used to spin steam turbines in the conventional way.","The France-based ITER project is the largest endeavor, with a budget of around 20 billion euros. A collaboration between Europe, the United States, China, India, Japan, Russia and South Korea, it is more than halfway towards the first test of its super-heated plasma by 2025 and first full-power fusion by 2035.","Unlike the MIT project, the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) team does not plan to generate electricity, saying this will be further in the future, and is being supported by governments rather than the private sector.","“Based on our experience with the ITER project, we feel the MIT timeline to a power plant in 15 years is very ambitious, if not overly ambitious,” ITER chief scientist Tim Luce said.","“But if they succeed, we will celebrate their success.”","ITER director Bernard Bigot said nuclear fusion research and development were being driven mainly by governments, likening it to the early days of space technology and suggesting the time had yet to arrive when private investors would take the lead.","“In fusion research we are only about in the 1960s, before anybody got to the moon,” Bigot said.",MIT and Eni are more optimistic.,"The Boston-based team, which has built a bedroom-sized experimental tokamak reactor, plans to develop a larger-scale system of superconducting magnets within three years and build a fusion reactor within eight before finally, within 15 years, completing a nuclear-fusion power plant generating electricity.","“Our goal is to do things even faster than that because it is a unique opportunity right now and with climate change we should be aggressive and ambitious,” said Bob Mumgaard, chief executive of MIT project company Commonwealth Fusion System.","He said the MIT and ITER projects differed mainly in their magnet technologies, and that MIT’s system enabled it to contain plasma in a smaller chamber.","“In fusion devices the magnetic field is very important and this will allow us to build a device which is one sixtieth the volume of ITER,” Mumgaard said, adding that MIT’s final-stage reactor would be the size of a basketball court.","Though research into nuclear fusion dates to the 1950s, some scientists doubt the technology can become a commercial energy source within MIT’s 15-year timeframe.","“The ability to make these components work in the desired way in the presence of such intense fields of irradiation ... is a very big challenge,” said Matteo Passoni, a nuclear engineer and expert on plasma physics at Milan’s Polytechnic University.","For Eni, though, its investment in fusion represents a modest bet on a potentially big discovery, a familiar equation to its upstream division when it explores for oil and gas.","“Arriving within 15-16 years at a commercial reactor is exactly the timeframe we use in upstream,” Casula said."

He said Eni had signed a deal giving it the right to use the project’s intellectual property.","“The eventual stake we’ll have in the company will be decided when there is an overall investment agreement, depending also on how much they will raise,” Casula said.","The MIT project is vying with research teams in France, China and Britain to develop a reactor that can generate more energy than the enormous amount that fusion consumes, and can also safely contain a mass of super-hot gases or plasma.","Italy also recently entered the race, though Eni is sticking with MIT, saying the Boston project is unique in its aim to produce electricity, while others have scientific objectives.","All projects are based on a system known as tokamak, which uses superconducting magnets to hold the plasma at temperatures of up to 100 million degrees, suspending it inside a vacuum chamber without it touching the chamber’s walls.","To make electricity, heat produced by the fusion of hydrogen isotopes is used to spin steam turbines in the conventional way.","The France-based ITER project is the largest endeavour, with a budget of around 20 billion euros. A collaboration between Europe, the United States, China, India, Japan, Russia and South Korea, it is more than halfway towards the first test of its super-heated plasma by 2025 and first full-power fusion by 2035.","Unlike the MIT project, the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) team does not plan to generate electricity, saying this will be further in the future, and is being supported by governments rather than the private sector.","“Based on our experience with the ITER project, we feel the MIT timeline to a power plant in 15 years is very ambitious, if not overly ambitious,” ITER chief scientist Tim Luce said.","“But if they succeed, we will celebrate their success.”","ITER director Bernard Bigot said nuclear fusion research and development were being driven mainly by governments, likening it to the early days of space technology and suggesting the time had yet to arrive when private investors would take the lead.","“In fusion research we are only about in the 1960s, before anybody got to the moon,” Bigot said.",MIT and Eni are more optimistic.,"The Boston-based team, which has built a bedroom-sized experimental tokamak reactor, plans to develop a larger-scale system of superconducting magnets within three years and build a fusion reactor within eight before finally, within 15 years, completing a nuclear-fusion power plant generating electricity.","“Our goal is to do things even faster than that because it is a unique opportunity right now and with climate change we should be aggressive and ambitious,” said Bob Mumgaard, chief executive of MIT project company Commonwealth Fusion System.","He said the MIT and ITER projects differed mainly in their magnet technologies, and that MIT’s system enabled it to contain plasma in a smaller chamber.","“In fusion devices the magnetic field is very important and this will allow us to build a device which is one sixtieth the volume of ITER,” Mumgaard said, adding that MIT’s final-stage reactor would be the size of a basketball court.","Though research into nuclear fusion dates to the 1950s, some scientists doubt the technology can become a commercial energy source within MIT’s 15-year timeframe.","“The ability to make these components work in the desired way in the presence of such intense fields of irradiation ... is a very big challenge,” said Matteo Passoni, a nuclear engineer and expert on plasma physics at Milan’s Polytechnic University.","For Eni, though, its investment in fusion represents a modest bet on a potentially big discovery, a familiar equation to its upstream division when it explores for oil and gas.","“Arriving within 15-16 years at a commercial reactor is exactly the timeframe we use in upstream,” Casula said.
