On Tuesday, BOJ Governor Haruhiko Kuroda said the central bank would not hesitate to take additional easing steps if risks to the economy grow and threaten momentum towards its 2% inflation target. There has been speculation that Japan’s banks might start charging fees for account holders if the central bank deepens negative interest rates and puts more pressure on banks’ profits. Fujiwara, however, said that the idea should not be directly linked with monetary policy.","While nothing had been decided about the fees, he said, the bank was as a stage where it should develop its pricing strategy “as a whole”. That comes after the bank recently said it would raise transfer fees from March 2020 for customers using ATMs and telephone.","As the domestic market is expected to shrink, Mizuho's bigger competitors such as Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group 8306.T and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group 8316.T have aggressively tapped into Asia by investing in local commercial banks.","While Mizuho looks at the growing market, it will possibly consider another approach: business tie-ups with non-financial firms. Earlier this year, Mizuho agreed with Japanese messaging app operator Line Corp 3938.T to establish a new bank, aiming to take in Line's vast platform which has more than 80 million monthly active users.","“When it comes to expanding business into Asia, it has often meant acquiring a financial firm. But in the future, a business partnership with non-financial company will be one of our options,” said Fujiwara."

But now that he has it, he is coming to grips with the scale of the turnaround needed for Mizuho, which has the best blue-chip corporate client base in Japan but worst profits among the country’s three megabanks.","“My biggest mission is to improve profitability in terms of both revenues and costs. We are beginning to see the problems we need to address. The current objective is to work on them,” he told Reuters in an interview.","Just two of the 14 analysts following the company and tracked by Reuters rate it a “buy,” compared with at least three-quarters of those following its peers, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (SMFG).","Mizuho’s core business profits in its last financial year dropped to 457.8 billion yen - barely half what they were three years ago, as costs bloomed and lending revenue dwindled.","“Mizuho’s strength has been said to be its vast client base. But its recent profit falls have made me wonder if it is really the case,” said Keisuke Moriyama, analyst at Macquarie Capital.","Investors have reacted cautiously to Sakai. Since his appointment was announced in January, Mizuho’s shares have fallen 11 percent - outperforming MUFG shares, which fell 25 percent, and SMFG’s, which dropped 18 percent.","Sakai said that although his reputation was less colourful than that of his predecessor, they shared some qualities: “He was good at presenting concepts and ideas in a very understandable form and in energizing everyone. Actually, no one says this but I am also good at that.”",Mizuho observers consider Sakai to embody the next step in the bank’s transformation efforts.,"“In phase one, Sato tried to unite the bank under ‘One Mizuho’ slogan, and he succeeded – but his efforts did not result in numbers. In phase two, Mizuho has to make money,” said a senior banking analyst, who declined to be named because he was not authorised to speak to media.",Japan’s megabanks are among the biggest in the world – all three rank in the top 20 by asset value - but profitability has been crushed by the low and negative interest rate policies the Bank of Japan has pursued to foster inflation.,"This has spurred a search for higher-margin opportunities. MUFG focused on buying overseas businesses, while SMFG ramped up its lending to smaller companies.","Mizuho, meanwhile, sought to replicate its strong client relationships at home with overseas blue-chips - big-name behemoths like Xerox Corp, Unilever and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd - expecting that lending would lead to other opportunities such as bond underwriting and transaction banking.","Under Sato, net interest income - the profits from lending over the costs of those funds - fell 7 percent to 807.4 billion yen ($7.31 billion) in its last financial year to March 31.","“One of the reasons for Mizuho’s low profitability is it is not taking necessary risks. Targeting global blue chips is a case in point. It should have taken steps to increase lending to non-investment grade companies a lot earlier,” said SBI Securities analyst Toyoki Sameshima.","Sakai told Reuters he has already moved to lend more to sub-investment grade companies, among other measures, in an effort to shake up a risk-averse corporate culture.","“My biggest mission is to improve profitability in terms of both revenues and costs,” he said. “We need to change our mindset. Instead of saying superfluous things, we should stick to results. We should be obsessed with what kind of results our business produces for customers.”","Sakai is steeped in Japanese banking; in 1984 he joined Industrial Bank of Japan, one of the three institutions that merged about 20 years ago to create Mizuho.","His roles have included investment banking and a stint in New York. He also spent 10 years in Mizuho’s elite corporate planning unit, which makes its strategic decisions - a highly sought-after role in Japanese banks.","As head of Mizuho, he must contend with the fact he wasn’t considered the first choice for his job. The smart money was on Akira Sugano, then head of global corporate division, while Sakai was president of Mizuho Securities, a role that signalled the twilight of a career.",Those who know him describe him as serious and a stickler for detail. One executive at a company with close ties to Mizuho said he talked mostly about business when they had dinner.,Sakai agreed that abstraction and meandering were not in his nature.,"“I visualize things, quantify things,” he said. “I would not leave vague concepts as they are. Numbers do not lie. We need to look at numbers and discuss the business behind these numbers. Good, strong companies are those which do these things.”","His supporters suggest that his brand of quiet, straight-talking pragmatism are just what Mizuho needs.","“As CEO, Sato should have focused on work.

Unlike peers Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc 8306.T and Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group Inc 8316.T, Mizuho has not splurged abroad in search of growth to offset stagnation at home where aggressive central bank policy eats into lending income.","One criticism analysts often level at Mizuho is an apparent focus on large, blue-chip firms which have a very low chance of defaulting on loan repayments and so are able to borrow cheaply - something which also makes them not very profitable customers.","Tatsufumi Sakai, who assumed his role in April, said Mizuho must change its risk-averse culture to improve profitability.","“We are taking various measures to improve our risk-taking capabilities,” Sakai said in an interview. “For instance, we are making conscious efforts in the overseas non-investment grade field, where we had a tendency to seek safety and avoid errors.”","Mizuho’s domestic loan-deposit rate margin - the difference between interest earned from loans and paid for deposits - was 0.84 percent for October-March, compared with 0.97 percent at SMFG. It was 1.24 percent five years earlier, just before the central bank began a policy aimed at reducing lending costs.","Under another initiative, Sakai, 58, said credit officers responsible for screening loans are being embedded with each business unit rather than grouped in an independent department, to make the whole process of lending more responsive to clients.","“We cannot help customers when they really need it by just playing safe,” said Sakai, a career Mizuho banker.","On expanding abroad, Sakai said Mizuho is unlikely to buy a full-service bank catering to both retail and business clients, such as MUFG target PT Bank Danamon Indonesia Tbk BDMN.JK.","“Basically, our global business is ‘B2B’ (business to business) and it’s our priority to sharpen our edge there,” he said. “We won’t try to enter B2C (business to consumer) in a single big deal.”","Rather, he said Mizuho is more likely to invest in or buy financial technology (fintech) start-up companies, for which the bank has a dedicated private equity fund.","Traditional financial institutions have been investing in fintech research and start-ups in anticipation of nimbler, innovative rivals attracting younger generations with cheaper, easier-to-use services in areas such as lending and remittance.","“For us, it’s important from the viewpoint of buying seeds for technology and business. It won’t cost much anyway,” Sakai said."
