The wary buyside limited its exposure to low, Single B rated loans that are subject to fall to Triple C, which is just notches above a default.","Default volume for US leveraged loans through mid-June totaled US$36.9bn, including US$14.6bn in May, which was the most defaults in a month since April 2014, according to a June 19 report from Fitch Ratings.","“The loan market is healing and getting back to more normal terms,” said Michael Marzouk, managing director for bank loan strategies at Pacific Asset Management. “Loan volumes are lower, but the secondary market has tightened and there is much more fluidity in the asset class.”","The LPC 100, a cohort of the 100 most liquid US leveraged loans, recovered to 93.07 cents on the dollar on Tuesday, from a nadir of 77.87 cents on March 23.","Leveraged loan issuance tallied roughly US$113.8bn for the second quarter, a sharp drop from the US$271.5bn raised in the first quarter of this year, according to data from Refinitiv LPC.","Of the US$113.8bn of volume, only US$11.4bn of the loans carried a rating of Single B, underscoring investor reluctance to commit to borrowers exposed to potential downgrades to Triple C. In the first quarter, US$94.7bn of loan issuance was rated Single B, according to the data.","Collateralized Loan Obligations (CLOs), the single-largest buyer of new leveraged loans, can only hold a certain portion of facilities rated Triple C before triggering tests within the fund. Investing in higher-rated loans allows CLOs to improve the average rating within their portfolios.","“Some of these downgrades happened amid market uncertainty,” said Lauren Basmadjian, a senior portfolio manager at the Carlyle Group. “And Covid-19 was the straw that broke the camel’s back for companies that had already been struggling pre-Covid.”","Investment-grade and leveraged merger and acquisition loans fell to US$52.4bn in the second quarter from US$79.3bn in the first, according to Refinitiv LPC data.",The dip in M&A comes as market players struggle to evaluate risk in a global economy still grappling with the consequences of the economic slowdown brought on by Covid-19.,"However, intervention from the US Federal Reserve to partake in bond-buying has buoyed credit markets. Bankers leveraged that momentum in the second quarter to syndicate bonds and loans for M&A deals that were underwritten before the pandemic halted new issuance, leaving banks stuck holding onto the debt.","In June, technology services provider Tech Data raised roughly US$2bn in loans to fund its buyout by private equity firm Apollo Global Management. Casino operator Caesars raised US$1.8bn in loans that backed its acquisition by peer Eldorado Resorts and German elevator manufacturer ThyssenKrupp on Tuesday finalized roughly US$4bn in loans to back its buyout by a consortium of investors led by Advent International and Cinven.","In order to offload these loans, underwriters sold the debt with steeper original issue discounts and juicier coupons. In fact, the average three-year yield on first-lien loans widened to 7.55% in the second quarter from 5.04% in the first three months of the year. And throughout June, the average discount for new, first-lien leveraged loans was roughly 97.1 cents, compared to 99.7 cents for new leveraged loans issued in February, Refinitiv LPC data showed.","In particular, a US$537m loan supporting energy business Apergy’s tie-up with Ecolab’s upstream business cleared at a discount of 94.5 cents on the dollar in early June. Just days later, entertainment technology firm Xperi’s US$1.05bn loan supporting its merger with TiVo was offloaded at a discount of 90.5 cents as skeptical investors pushed back on new money transactions amid heightened economic uncertainty.","“We’re hopeful of moving beyond the crisis, but each day the headlines change and prognostications about a recovery or a second lockdown create uncertainty for the marketplace,” said a senior banker."

They were required to self-isolate for 14 days.",A Carnival Australia spokesman said on Monday the company would cooperate with the probe.,"The ship has remained in Australian waters and on Monday docked at Port Kembla, with the remaining crew from 50 different countries on board to stay in isolation.",The government banned cruise ships from docking except for emergencies as of mid-March and has sent off most of the cruise ships that remained in Australian waters over the past week.,"Australia has seen a sharp drop in the rate of new cases after closing national and state borders, quarantining people on all incoming flights in hotels for 14 days, restricting public gatherings to two, and shutting pubs, restaurants, and gyms.","While the growth in new cases slows, the number of people contracting the virus from an unknown local source is steadily growing, particularly in NSW.",Australia’s Deputy Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly said 8% of coronavirus cases are now locally acquired.,"Authorities remain concerned that some Australians are flouting social distancing rules, particularly around the country’s renowned beaches.","After weekend crowds gathered on Sydney’s northern beaches and beaches along Queensland’s famed tourist strip the Gold Coast, local governments announced several beach closures.","Australia’s most famous beach Bondi has been closed for the past two weeks, with police fining people who trespass.",In efforts to better monitor local infections testing criteria will be widened beyond people who have been in contact with COVID-19 cases.,"The state of Victoria will now test anyone over 65, teachers and child care workers if they display any of symptom of coronavirus, while Western Australia will do the same.","“If we can focus on those with compatible symptoms, coughs, sore throat, runny nose with or without a fever, and get them tested, then we will be able to see how much community transmission there might be,” said Victoria state’s Chief Medical Officer, Andrew Wilson.","Pacific nations have so far avoided some of the more devastating effects of COVID-19 suffered in China, parts of Europe and the United States.","New Zealand, which has been in lock-down since March 25, has recorded just over 1,100 confirmed cases. It has suffered one death linked to the virus.",New Zealand’s Director-General of Health Ashley Bloomfield said on Monday that the rate of increase in COVID-19 cases was “levelling off”.
