While many companies use cost cuts to launch takeovers, the $27.7 billion offer that Marc Benioff’s firm has made for Slack may be more about revenue synergies.","Salesforce sells software that helps salespeople be more productive and Benioff has repeatedly bought companies to add useful functions. Layering on a service that allows people to collaborate online – like the one that Slack sells – makes logical sense, especially as lockdowns have accelerated the growth of both people and teams working remotely. As Benioff put it repeatedly on Tuesday’s call, Slack will be the user interface running on top of Salesforce’s software channels.","The trouble, as in any acquisition, is justifying the price. Slack loses money now, but Salesforce is paying for what it could become. The company is currently growing revenue about 50% annually and should have almost $1.1 billion in the next 12 months according to analyst estimates from Refinitiv. Meantime Salesforce grows quickly too, but less than half the rate of Slack.","Slack’s multiple reflects this. Salesforce is paying about 26 times its estimated revenue versus Salesforce’s roughly 9 times. It suggests that Salesforce needs to turn every dollar that Slack makes into three to justify the difference in valuation, or put another way, it would have to add a bit over $3 billion to the purchaser’s top line, or about 13% of estimated revenue of $23.8 billion over time – or prevent it from disappearing – for the acquisition to be a good idea.","That can be either about growth or defense. Microsoft has been heavily pushing Teams, its alternative to Slack. Chief Executive Satya Nadella mentioned in the last earnings call that Teams was driving increased usage of other Microsoft software, including products that compete directly with Salesforce. So its success suggests Salesforce could cross-sell or upsell its products, too, reaching the ever-elusive revenue synergies that companies often try to attain.","But it could also simply be about stopping any future business from migrating over to Microsoft, which is harder for shareholders to see, and Benioff to explain, some three years down the line. Investors have knocked off more than $30 billion off Salesforce’s market capitalization since news of talks emerged. Benioff could be an exception, but if broader merger history is any guide, it suggests they’re rightly taking a skeptical view."

Spending on video games in the United States reached $1.2 billion in June, the highest June total in over a decade, according to research firm NPD.","However, the industry is also grappling with remote-working challenges. On Tuesday 343 Industries, part of Microsoft’s Xbox Game Studios, delayed the release of “Halo Infinite”, a science fiction shoot-’em-up, to 2021. The company blamed development challenges “including the ongoing Covid-related impacts”. This could be a significant blow: The last big-ticket instalment of “Halo” pulled in more than $400 million in its first week, according to the Verge.",Gaming companies have so far adapted relatively well to lockdown; Ubisoft’s annual report noted a “manageable” effect on production schedules.

Marc Benioff’s Salesforce.com has offloaded a stake in Zoom Video Communications it bought in the video-conferencing outfit’s initial public offering, according to a company filing. Salesforce snapped up $100 million of the stock when Zoom went public in April 2019, according to news reports. The company’s ventures arm also bought shares in the Dropbox and SurveyMonkey IPOs, according to CNBC.","Though the exact dates of Salesforce’s second-quarter sales aren’t available, Zoom has been a big beneficiary of remote communication during coronavirus lockdowns. It went public at $36 a share. Between April and June 2020, the stock traded between $109 and $262, by Refinitiv data.

A deal in February to buy Forever 21, also with Authentic Brands, suggests that it is becoming ever more eager to go further than usual to ensure its bills are paid.","Meanwhile boss David Simon’s decision to walk away from one of his company’s commitments in July, ditching a deal to buy rival mall owner Taubman Centers, isn’t exactly a vote of confidence in his day job. Without shoppers trotting back into malls, there is only so much Simon can do. (By Lauren Silva Laughlin)","DELIVERY BOOM. Online retailers have made the most of lockdown. Fashion group ASOS said on Wednesday that sales and pre-tax profit in the current financial year would significantly exceed market expectations. One reason is fewer returned items. The other is a surge in demand for workout gear from its main client base, shoppers in their twenties, while they were housebound. Something similar happened in America, where sweatpant sales leapt 80% in April compared with a month earlier, according to the New York Times.","Sweatpants may come in handy given surging demand for food to be delivered to doorsteps. Just Eat Takeaway.com, the delivery company that in June offered to buy American Grubhub, reported adjusted EBITDA of 177 million euros in the first half of the year, two-fifths more than analysts had expected. With people yet to return to their pre-coronavirus habits, comfort eating and comfy clothes may remain in high demand. (By Aimee Donnellan and Karen Kwok)","BAD RECORD. Britain’s second-quarter recession was brutal. GDP shrank by a record 20.4% compared with the first three months of the year, official data showed on Wednesday. That was worse than even the hardest-hit euro zone country, Spain. The explanation is simple. The tough UK lockdown lasted for more of the second quarter than similar measures in the four biggest euro zone countries and the United States.","Still, British GDP has fallen by more than any other Group of Seven industrial nation even over the first half of 2020. A recovery started in June. How fast will it be? The Bank of England predicted last week that GDP won’t exceed its pre-Covid peak until the end of 2021. Finance minister Rishi Sunak opposes extending a furlough scheme that expires in October. Other stimulus plans may be needed to ensure the rebound is no slower. (By Swaha Pattanaik)","CLIPPED WINGS. The skies remain dark for Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific. The troubled air carrier recorded a $1.3 billion net loss for the first half of 2020. Chairman Patrick Healy called the period “the most challenging the group has ever faced”, as travel restrictions slashed passenger numbers by 76% year-on-year, with recovery nowhere in sight.","Its only hope now is freight. The airline had an 8.8% boost in cargo revenue, in line with regional peers. Singapore Airlines enjoyed a 35% jump in the same category in the second quarter, while Taiwan media reported that the island’s China Airlines avoided a loss entirely due to record income from hauling goods. However, the freight fairy tale might be short-lived as fees return to normal. Cathay shares are now trading at around a quarter of their 2010 peak, and its home market remains in deep recession. It may not regain altitude any time soon. (By Jamie Lo)"

A new book by the Salesforce.Com boss argues that doing good is a business imperative. Though his call to action at times reads like an advertisement for the $128 billion company, he demonstrates how helping society can also boost the bottom line.","“Trailblazer: The Power of Business as the Greatest Platform for Change”, written with former Wall Street Journal reporter Monica Langley, is well-timed to address the growing questions about capitalism’s negative side effects. The Business Roundtable, which brings together the heads of the biggest U.S. companies, in August called for firms to be run for the benefit of all stakeholders, including employees, rather than just investors. Companies are also stepping in when policymakers fail to act. Walmart announced in September that the retailer would stop selling handgun ammunition in the wake of mass shootings.","Benioff preaches that values create value and calls on other companies to join him. The cloud computing guru makes a business case that younger generations are devoted to higher purposes, which will affect how they decide where to work and what to buy. For businesses to thrive, he says, the question to ask is no longer “are we doing well?” but “are we doing good?”.","This mantra is common among CEOs these days, but the San Francisco native was ahead of his time. When Salesforce started in 1999, its co-founders pledged to donate 1% of its products, 1% of its equity and 1% of its employees’ time to certain causes. This has so far resulted in almost $300 million in grants and workers volunteering four million hours. Meanwhile, shares in the customer-management software provider have generated a 3,500% return since it went public in 2004.","The political dilemmas that Salesforce faced are the most illuminating. In 2015 Mike Pence, then the governor of Indiana, signed a law that critics said would allow discrimination based on sexual orientation. Salesforce workers in the state, home to the company’s second-largest U.S. office, said the measure sparked fear.","At first, it didn’t occur to Benioff to step in. It wasn’t until an executive pointedly asked what he was going to do about the growing backlash that he realized how Salesforce responded would say a lot about the company. He announced on Twitter that the group would dramatically cut its investment in the state.","His efforts to galvanize other executives met with a mixed response. Several ignored him while others criticized him for putting his own values ahead of those of investors. But some rallied round, including Apple boss Tim Cook, and Pence eventually compromised. The incident raised Salesforce’s profile and made it a more attractive place to work. The company’s revenue rose by nearly 25% the following year.","The early lesson in employee activism taught Benioff that if leaders won’t act, “they’ll have to face the bayonets poking up from below.” That’s even more true today. Last year, Alphabet-owned Google dropped out of an artificial intelligence contract with the U.S. Department of Defense after employee protests.","Doing good, or at least avoiding doing bad, is a constant process. Just last year, hundreds of Salesforce employees publicly opposed having the U.S. Customs and Border Protection as a customer at a time when migrant children were being separated and detained at the U.S. border with Mexico. As employees questioned whether Salesforce really stood behind its values, Benioff was cut off from the world on a “digital detox”. When he came back, he decided to appoint a chief ethical and humane use officer to ensure Salesforce technology wouldn’t be used for nefarious purposes.","At times, Benioff comes across as self-serving. The book is sprinkled with laundry lists of causes that he and Salesforce have been involved in, like the water recycling system at the company’s San Francisco headquarters. He also weaves in references to helping customers like Home Depot after the financial crisis.","But Benioff redeems himself by showing he practices what he preaches. One of his most compelling case studies comes at the end of the book. A San Francisco ballot measure to slightly increase taxes for big companies to fund efforts to fight homelessness was unpopular when Benioff became a vocal proponent. Car-hailing service Lyft and payments group Stripe opposed it, as did Twitter Chief Executive Jack Dorsey. The feud between Dorsey and Benioff helped the proposal gain traction and it passed with about 60% approval from voters.","Benioff goes well beyond the platitudes mouthed by other CEOs by taking a stand on controversial topics. Just this week he called for Facebook to be broken up. These high-profile positions beg the question of whether he might follow in the footsteps of his grandfather, a former San Francisco supervisor, and enter politics. Whatever happens next, though, his demonstration of how doing good can pay off makes him a credible agent of change."

Its $26 billion acquisition in 2016 of LinkedIn, perhaps the most common tool used by sales people trying to drum up business, was a key piece of the effort here.","In doing so, both are taking on Salesforce, the cloud software company that offers sales and marketing software, where Adobe and Microsoft lack one or the other.","But by integrating their systems, Adobe and Microsoft can offer something arguably “a lot broader” because Adobe software is how most marketing content gets made, said Melissa Webster, program vice president for content and digital media technologies at research firm IDC.","“There’s no question that Microsoft and Adobe both have a lot to gain from teaming up against Salesforce,” Webster said.",Salesforce could not be reached immediately for comment.,(The story corrects the title of Steve Lucas in paragraph 4)
