Inquiries into British American Tobacco, aero engine maker Rolls-Royce and drugs company GlaxoSmithKline have all been dropped over the past two years.",Some lawyers say lengthy cases need to have their wheels regularly kicked as the SFO can only proceed with criminal investigations if the evidence supports a realistic prospect of conviction and if a prosecution is in the public interest.,"“Closing cases that are ultimately ‘without legs’ evidentially is the right thing to do,” said Sarah Wallace, a lawyer at Constantine Law, adding that this would help to clear desks and capacity for an expected wave of enforcement activity over pandemic-related wrongdoing.",The SFO’s investigation into KBR ended in a tussle at the UK Supreme Court last month over whether it was wrong to try and compel foreign businesses to hand over documents held overseas.,"In a blow to the agency, senior judges ruled that it had no extraterritorial reach -- although they confirmed the agency’s power to compel UK companies to repatriate documents held overseas.",The SFO said the ruling had no bearing on its decision to close the KBR investigation.,"The KBR investigation was originally related to a sprawling inquiry into Unaoil, a Monaco-based oil and gas consultancy, which has led to four men being convicted in Britain of bribery to secure contracts worth $1.7 billion for Unaoil and Western, blue-chip clients.","Unaoil’s former chief executive and chief operating officer, Cyrus and Saman Ahsani, in 2019 pleaded guilty in the United States to being part of a 17-year scheme to pay millions of dollars in bribes to officials in the Middle East, Africa and Central Asia."

But after a degree of initial cooperation, KBR Inc challenged a Section 2 notice handed to a U.S.-based senior executive in July 2017 during a London meeting to discuss the investigation.","KBR Inc said the notice was “ultra vires”, or beyond the SFO’s legal authority, because it sought material held outside the UK, that the agency should have relied on Mutual Legal Assistance (MLA) from U.S. authorities and that the notice could not be handed to an officer temporarily in the jurisdiction.",MLA -- when enforcement authorities exchange information in different nations -- is a more cumbersome route to securing evidence than Section 2 notices. Failure to comply with such an order can lead to imprisonment or a fine.,"But its powers are enshrined in a 1987 law that largely pre-dates complex, multinational corporate structures and the easy digital transfer of documents.",Lawyers said the old law might be ill-suited to the modern age but that it was not the role of the courts to rewrite statutes to further a public interest in investigating crime.,"“The judgment is a welcome reminder of the presumption against extraterritoriality in English criminal law,” said Andrew Smith, a partner at law firm Corker Binning.","Judith Seddon, a partner at Ropes & Gray, called the decision a “victory for principled statutory interpretation”.","The SFO still has Overseas Production Orders, a new power introduced in 2019 to speed up the MLA process to secure electronic data held overseas if a co-operation treaty exists between jurisdictions. Companies seeking to avoid prosecution can also voluntarily cooperate with the agency."
