Prosecutors said he evaded taxes on $16 million laundered through shell companies overseas.,"The talks over a deal come ahead of a planned hearing in Washington on Friday where the judge, among other things, is scheduled to rule on evidence to be allowed at trial. Manafort could plead guilty at the hearing, one of the sources said.","Three members of Manafort’s defense team - Kevin Downing, Thomas Zehnle and Richard Westling - declined to comment as they entered their office on Thursday evening. Mueller’s spokesman Peter Carr declined to comment on the possible deal, which was first reported by ABC News.",Manafort’s wife Kathleen also did not answer questions when she stopped by the lawyers’ office to drop off a navy men’s suit.,‘BLOODIED UP’,"Joshua Dressler, a law professor at Ohio State University, said it made sense that Manafort, 69, was considering cutting his losses and avoiding the time and money needed to defend himself against a second trial.","Manafort is already facing 8 to 10 years in prison from the eight guilty counts in Virginia, terms that may not change significantly no matter the outcome of the second trial.","“With eight convictions already in place, and more possible convictions awaiting him, it seems that he has been bloodied up enough to see the light,” Dressler said.","Manafort worked for five months on Trump’s 2016 campaign, including three as chairman. He resigned in August 2016 following a news report linking him to covert payments from a pro-Kremlin political party in Ukraine.","Rudy Giuliani, the former New York City mayor who is representing Trump in the Russia probe, previously told the Politico news outlet that taking a plea deal to avoid a second trial would not crush Manafort’s chances of receiving an eventual presidential pardon. Trump has not said whether he would pardon Manafort but he has not publicly ruled it out.",Manafort was at a controversial meeting at Trump Tower in 2016 where Russians were offering “dirt” on election opponent Hillary Clinton. Trump’s critics have pointed to the meeting as evidence of the collusion with Russia that Trump denies.,"“I don’t think he has any information that would hurt the president,” Giuliani told Reuters.","Trump praised Manafort last month for not entering into a plea agreement, as the president’s former personal lawyer Michael Cohen had. “Unlike Michael Cohen, he refused to ‘break’ - make up stories in order to get a ‘deal. Such respect for a brave man!”, Trump wrote on Twitter on Aug. 22.","Rick Gates, Manafort’s former business partner and the campaign’s deputy chairman, pleaded guilty to lesser charges in exchange for his cooperation, later testifying against Manafort in Virginia.","Gates could be called as a prosecution witness in his Washington trial as well, as could veteran political operative Samuel Patten, who pleaded guilty to unregistered lobbying for Ukrainian politicians two weeks ago.","A second trial could delve deeper into Manafort’s Russian connections including to Konstantin Kilimnik, a Ukrainian-Russian political consultant who was indicted along with Manafort and who Mueller’s team has linked to Russian intelligence.","Prosecutors have said Manafort and Kilimnik conspired to tamper with witnesses, which prompted U.S. District Court Judge Amy Berman Jackson to revoke his bail and order him jailed pending trial."

Devine’s firm said in a statement he was serving as a fact witness and had been assured he did not have legal exposure.",Manafort has pleaded not guilty to 18 counts of bank and tax fraud and failure to file reports of foreign bank accounts. The charges largely pre-date the five months when Manafort worked on Trump’s campaign in 2016.,"A large number of the witnesses are executives at banks that lent Manafort money, the accounting firm that did his taxes and others involved in financial dealings who could be asked to corroborate documentary evidence showing the alleged bank and tax fraud at the heart of the case.","“The case will be proven by paper and those people who have a transactional relationship to the paper,” said Michael Zeldin, a former federal prosecutor. “All those people to say essentially that Manafort knew what he was doing.”","The trial had been scheduled to start this past Wednesday in the Washington suburb of Alexandria, but U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III delayed it until next Tuesday and directed Mueller to provide a witness list to Manafort’s lawyers.","The list also included people at businesses where Manafort spent money such as the director of ticket operations at the New York Yankees baseball team, the head of a landscaping firm and an executive at a Mercedes-Benz dealership.","Renato Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor who is now a defense lawyer, said prosecutors likely want to show Manafort’s “luxurious lifestyle,” with the aim of making him less likeable to jurors.","Five of the witnesses, all financial professionals, were identified previously when they were granted immunity to testify.","None of the charges relate to possible coordination with Russian officials by Trump’s campaign, an important element of Mueller’s investigation into Moscow’s interference in the election. Russia denies election interference. Trump denies collusion.","Manafort faces a second criminal trial in Washington in September on related charges, including witness tampering, in connection with lobbying work he performed for the pro-Russia Ukrainian government."

Mueller’s office is also looking into possible links between President Donald Trump’s election campaign and Russia.","Even with the additional costs, the official figure is significantly less than what Trump has said the Mueller inquiry is costing taxpayers.","In a Twitter post earlier this month, Trump called the Mueller investigation a “$20,000,000 Witch Hunt”. Five days earlier, he estimated the cost of the probe at $10 million.","The largest direct expenditure by Mueller’s office for the period Oct. 1, 2017 to March 31, 2018 was $2.738 million in salaries and benefits for its employees, the Justice Department report said.","Mueller’s office spent $886,000 on rent, communications and utilities and $264,000 on “contractual services,” most of which involved information technology, according to the report.","Last year, Mueller’s office reported that in its first months from May 17 to Sept. 30, 2017, it spent a total of $3.2 million. Not counting additional spending by the Justice Department, Mueller and his team have spent a total of $7.7 million since his appointment just over a year ago.","The last time a special counsel was investigating a White House occupant, President Bill Clinton between August 1994 and February 1999, then counsel Kenneth Starr’s office spent $52 million in the 4-1/2 years."

In Virginia, he faces charges that include bank fraud and filing false tax returns.","He has pleaded not guilty to all of the charges, none of which are directly related to work he performed for Trump’s campaign.","In both criminal cases, Manafort has asked the courts to dismiss the charges on the grounds that Rosenstein’s May 17, 2017 appointment order hiring Mueller runs afoul of Justice Department rules on special counsels.","He has also argued that Mueller’s case against him has nothing to do with Russian interference in 2016 election, and that the probe by the FBI into his Ukraine dealings predates the Russia probe.",Trump has denied that his campaign colluded with Russia and called the probe that has dogged his presidency a “witch hunt.”,Jackson was not moved by any of Manafort’s assertions.,"“Manafort was, at one time, not merely ‘associated with,’ but the chairman of, the Presidential campaign, and his work on behalf of the Russia-backed Ukrainian political party and connections to other Russian figures are matters of public record,” she wrote, adding that it was “logical” for investigators to probe Manafort’s dealings.",Her ruling also pointed to an August 2017 memo by Rosenstein that further detailed the scope of the probe. That memo explicitly gave Mueller authority to probe all of Manafort’s Ukraine-related work predating the 2016 campaign.,Republicans in the House of Representatives who are critical of the Mueller probe have pressed the Justice Department in recent months to provide them with an unredacted copy of the August memo.,"The ruling marks a setback for Manafort, who last month was buoyed when the judge in the Alexandria case aggressively questioned prosecutors about whether their case was overly broad and mused that he believed they were using the charges to get Manafort to turn over dirt on Trump.","That judge, T.S. Ellis III for the Eastern District of Virginia, has yet to rule on whether to dismiss the charges against Manafort.","Ellis, who was appointed to the bench by Republican President Ronald Reagan, has also said he too wants to see an unredacted copy before he can fully form a decision on whether to dismiss the charges.",He told prosecutors to turn over a copy to him by Friday.

Downing asked Jackson to dismiss the Washington indictment.","“Here you have somebody who was a campaign official in the Trump campaign, where he had longstanding ties to Russia-backed politicians in the Ukraine,” Michael Dreeben, a prosecutor on Mueller’s team, said of Manafort. “What (was) the nature of those connections? Did they provide a means for surreptitious communications? Did they provide a back channel to Russia?”","Downing argued that Rosenstein’s order appointing Mueller in May 2017 was overly broad and violated Justice Department rules on the naming of special counsels, and that Mueller exceeded even the wide latitude Rosenstein provided.",Jackson expressed doubts over arguments that Mueller should not have been able to bring charges Downing called unrelated to Russia or Moscow’s potential coordination with Trump’s campaign.,"While Manafort has pleaded not guilty, Mueller has extracted guilty pleas from other former campaign figures including Manafort’s former deputy and business partner Rick Gates.","Downing said the FBI in 2014 closed out an earlier investigation of Manafort’s Ukraine business dealings without pursuing charges, meaning the matter cannot be covered by Mueller’s probe.",Dreeben said the special counsel had explicit authority from Rosenstein to probe Manafort’s Ukraine dealings based on an August 2017 memo.,"“It is not a blank check,” Dreeben said of Rosenstein’s parameters for the probe.","The memo was written a month after the FBI executed a search warrant at Manafort’s home in Alexandria, Virginia.
