Proceeds from the issuance are expected to be used for debt reduction and general corporate purposes, and the transaction is consistent with BSX’s Long-Term Issuer Default Rating of ‘BBB’/Stable Outlook.","Fitch expects the common and preferred stock offerings will generate a minimum of $1.5 billion in proceeds before fees. Fitch expects to apply 100% equity credit to the mandatory convertible preferred stock. BSX stated that $750 million of proceeds will be used to reduce outstanding term loans, and the remaining proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, which may include further debt reduction and funding for acquisitions or investments. Further reduction in debt would be a positive for the credit profile; Fitch considers debt/EBITDA maintained between 2.5x-3.0x as consistent with the ‘BBB’ IDR.","Fitch expects demand for certain of BSX’s products will be dampened in the near-term as volumes of elective surgeries experience a slow recovery following the peak of the pandemic-related business disruption. BSX’s emergent and semi-emergent related medical devices will provide revenue stability as more elective-type procedure demand will return on a regional basis. Temporary cost reduction efforts are assumed to not fully offset the impact of lower demand on a largely fixed cost structure, resulting in near-term EBITDA margin compression.","Bolstered liquidity from the stock issuances and management of capital deployment will help to preserve liquidity and reduce short-term debt over the next year. Fitch also expects relatively strong FCF for 2020, even amid operating pressures from the coronavirus pandemic. Gross debt/EBITDA is expected to peak above 3.0x at the end of 2020 but to decline fairly rapidly in 2021 due to recovery of EBITDA.",Fitch’s most recent rating action commentary can be found on its website or at the below link:,here,Contact:,Caitlin Blalock,Associate Director,"Fitch Ratings, Inc.","111 Congress Ave, Suite 2010","Austin, TX 78701","Media Relations: Elizabeth Fogerty, New York, Tel: +1 212 908 0526, Email: elizabeth.fogerty@thefitchgroup.com.",Additional information is available on www.fitchratings.com,"ALL FITCH CREDIT RATINGS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS.

The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors.

The transaction is expected to be leverage neutral. The ratings are supported by the strength of Boston Scientific’s operational profile, improving FCF profile and liquidity reserves. Gross debt/EBITDA is currently elevated for the rating due to financing the BTG plc acquisition and temporary demand impacts from the coronavirus pandemic. Fitch anticipates leverage will decline below 3.0x by YE 2021 as debt reduction is prioritized over share repurchases.",Key Rating Drivers,"Coronavirus Impact: Fitch expects Boston Scientific’s revenue demand will be dampened over the near term as elective surgeries continue to be deferred and that volumes could come back slowly as the pandemic persists. Temporary cost reduction efforts are assumed to not fully offset the impact of lower demand on a largely fixed cost structure, resulting in near-term EBITDA margin compression. Management of cash spending should help to preserve liquidity, and reduce short-term debt over the next year, supporting the ‘BBB’ Issuer Default Rating (IDR).","Leverage to Moderate Following BTG: The acquisition of BTG plc was largely debt-funded, but Fitch expects debt reduction through term loan repayments and modest cost synergies will help to reduce total debt/EBITDA to roughly below 3.0x by YE 2021. Boston Scientific’s internal focus on revenue growth, cost control and an improving sales mix will support continued EBITDA margin expansion over the long term. Fitch believes that Boston Scientific will focus cash deployment on some debt reduction and targeted acquisitions in areas that offer innovation and growth as the company has committed to suspend share repurchases as it reduces leverage.","Litigation Risk Declining: Boston Scientific has made material progress in resolving litigation issues, resulting in an improved litigation risk profile compared to six years ago. However, some financial risk related to litigation remains. Fitch expects the vast majority of the Pelvic Mesh cash settlements to be resolved by YE 2020. In addition, Fitch expects the company will continue to be disciplined in regards to cash deployment priorities while successful resolution of the litigation profile improves available cash for growth opportunities.","FCF Improving: FCF for the LTM period ended March 31, 2020 has improved materially following an unfavorable swing in working capital largely attributable to legal reserves in 2018. Improving sales and margins aided by continued cost controls and new product introductions should drive positive FCF going forward. The strong operational profile and lack of need to reserve cash for litigation provides more cash for capital deployment starting in 2020. Fitch believes the company will have more flexibility to pursue targeted acquisitions without incurring meaningful debt.","Focus on High-Growth Segments: Boston Scientific continues to focus on its high growth markets, including neuromodulation, peripheral interventions and structural heart. The company’s high growth businesses currently constitute roughly 25% of revenue and contribute high-single to double-digit growth. Approximately half of revenue is attributable to moderate growth businesses, including endoscopy, and core urology and pelvic health, and offer mid-single-digit growth profiles. The remaining portion of the business (pacers, defibrillators, and drug-eluting stents) contributes low to flat growth and Fitch expects revenues will continue to shift to the high-growth markets.","Fitch expects Boston Scientific will continue to launch new products in these respective markets. An already strong internal RD pipeline will likely be further supported by a preference for tuck-in to mid-sized acquisitions going forward. In addition, the company will likely continue to expand its presence in emerging markets.",Derivation Summary,"Boston Scientific Corp. (BBB/Stable) is a large diversified medical device firm focusing on interventional cardiology, peripheral interventions, cardiac rhythm management, electrophysiology, endoscopy, urology, pelvic health and neuromodulation. The company provides physicians with innovative medical devices, which it develops through internal RD, acquisitions or collaborations. Boston Scientific and the industry face some pricing headwinds. However, Boston Scientific continues to develop innovative products that offer value to physicians, patients and providers, helping to mitigate pricing pressure.","Boston Scientific is similar in scale and diversification to Baxter International (A-/Stable), although the companies’ product portfolios differ significantly. Baxter maintains a more conservative capital structure, helping to support the difference in IDRs. While smaller than some of its competitors such as Becton, Dickinson and Company (BBB-/Stable), Boston Scientific has a relatively broad medical device portfolio that enables the company to remain very competitive both domestically and internationally.",Key Assumptions,--Near-term impact of COVID-19 is expected to weaken top-line growth; Mid- to strong-single-digit organic revenue growth expected in normalized periods;,"--Near-term EBITDA margin pressure, assuming temporary cost reductions are not able to fully offset pull-through effect from largely fixed cost structure;","--EBITDA margin gradually improving in normalized periods driven by favorable mix, improving operating efficiencies and synergies from continued acquisition integrations;",--FCF remains relatively stable due to cash management efforts;,"--Some near-term maturities expected to be repaid, but the bulk of debt is expected to be refinanced as it comes due;",--Total debt/EBITDA declining around or below 3.0x by YE 2021 through stabilizing operations and some debt reduction.,"Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade:",--Continued operational improvements that support long-term positive revenue growth and margin stability/improvement;,--An operational profile that could lead to FCF/debt sustained around 20%;,--Cash deployment policy and resulting capital structure that would durably sustain total debt/EBITDA below 2.5x.,"Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade:",--Material and lasting deterioration in operations and FCF that led to FCF/debt durably below 10%;,--Persistent increase in total debt/EBITDA above 3.0x;,--Acquisitions without the prospect of timely debt/leverage reduction;,--Large legal settlements that would need to be funded with significant debt issuances.,Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario,"International scale credit ratings of Non-Financial Corporate issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings, visit here.",Liquidity and Debt Structure,"Sufficient Liquidity: Boston Scientific has sufficient liquidity, including a $2.75 billion committed revolving credit facility, a $2.75 billion CP program fully backed by the revolving credit facility and $370 million of cash on hand at March 31, 2020. Liquidity is bolstered by consistently solid cash generation, and Fitch expects liquidity to remain strong throughout the forecast period.","Debt Maturities Manageable: Boston Scientific’s debt maturities are well laddered and not onerous compared to its improving FCF profile. Fitch expects the company will refinance bond maturities as they come due, outside of larger leveraging transactions.",Date of Relevant Committee,19 December 2019,REFERENCES FOR SUBSTANTIALLY MATERIAL SOURCE CITED AS KEY DRIVER OF RATING,The principal sources of information used in the analysis are described in the Applicable Criteria.,Boston Scientific Corporation,----senior unsecured; Long Term Rating; New Rating; BBB,Contacts:,Primary Rating Analyst,"Caitlin Blalock,",Associate Director,"Fitch Ratings, Inc.",111 Congress Avenue Suite 2010,Austin 78701,Secondary Rating Analyst,"Robert Kirby, CFA",Director,Committee Chairperson,"Patrick Finnegan, CFA, CPA",Senior Director,"Media Relations: Elizabeth Fogerty, New York, Tel: +1 212 908 0526, Email: elizabeth.fogerty@thefitchgroup.com.",Additional information is available on www.fitchratings.com,Applicable Criteria,Corporate Rating Criteria (pub. 01 May 2020) (including rating assumption sensitivity),here,Corporates Notching and Recovery Ratings Criteria (pub. 14 Oct 2019) (including rating assumption sensitivity),here,Applicable Model,Numbers in parentheses accompanying applicable model(s) contain hyperlinks to criteria providing description of model(s).,"Corporate Monitoring & Forecasting Model (COMFORT Model), v7.7.0",1-here,Additional Disclosures,Solicitation Status,here,Endorsement Status,here,Endorsement Policy,here,"ALL FITCH CREDIT RATINGS ARE SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMERS.

The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors.

Ultimately, the issuer and its advisers are responsible for the accuracy of the information they provide to Fitch and to the market in offering documents and other reports. In issuing its ratings and its reports, Fitch must rely on the work of experts, including independent auditors with respect to financial statements and attorneys with respect to legal and tax matters. Further, ratings and forecasts of financial and other information are inherently forward-looking and embody assumptions and predictions about future events that by their nature cannot be verified as facts.

Ratings are not a recommendation to buy, sell, or hold any security.

Such fees generally vary from US$1,000 to US$750,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent) per issue. In certain cases, Fitch will rate all or a number of issues issued by a particular issuer, or insured or guaranteed by a particular insurer or guarantor, for a single annual fee. Such fees are expected to vary from US$10,000 to US$1,500,000 (or the applicable currency equivalent).
