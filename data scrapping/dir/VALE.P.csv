The world’s second largest producer of the key steelmaking ingredient has been under scrutiny from authorities after two deadly dam breaks in 2015 and 2019, and is the subject of several ongoing legal cases that often affect production.","On Monday, Vale said that last week it suspended tailings disposal and works at the B7 dam at Jeceaba, in Minas Gerais state. The company also said it suspended Viga waste disposal plant in Congonhas, in Minas Gerais state.","Both suspensions affect output, since mining sludge from iron ore mining needs to be properly disposed. They came after a court ruling on a public civil action suit filed by the municipality of Jeceaba, the company said.","This is the second time Vale has suspended operations at the waste disposal plant, with impact to production, since acquiring it in August last year.","Vale bought miner Ferrous Resources Limited for $550 million in 2019, including units for mining tailings disposal, after shutting down some of its dams in Minas Gerais state for security risk.","Vale said in the Monday filing the Viga operational unit fulfills the necessary requirements for the issuance of the B7 dam operating permit, and will try to revert the decision in court.","Two weeks after the acquisition in 2019, Vale said it had identified an inconsistency in the documents related to the operation permit from the municipality of Jeceaba. Operations were suspended for about three months, with a similar impact to production - approximately 330,000 tonnes per month - the company said then.

The company said it has regular meetings with the prosecutors and auditors, it promptly addresses possible risks and is on schedule to fulfill all its commitments.",The task force requested earlier this month that Vale’s top executives in charge of safety operations be removed and for an external expert to be brought in to revamp the company’s strategy and culture around safety. A judge is expected to rule on the request in early October.,"The prosecutor task force, Vitorelli said, still regards Vale’s safety approach as flawed. Both state and federal prosecutors told Reuters that in their view the company fails to take preventative measures, does not proactively disclose safety issues, waiting instead to be pressed by external auditors and authorities before taking action.","They listed, in their request to the judge, what they regarded as repeated failures on the part of Vale to improve safety at its tailings dams.",Their concerns come on top of a separate report by a United Nations’ expert on Wednesday who said Vale’s restoration projects following the dam disaster in 2015 are behind scheduled.,Vale said it has extensive documentation to prove its compliance with commitments made to prosecutors which it will present to the court.,"“It’s not lack time or money to meet the requirements. It’s five years since the first disaster. The problem is the company’s culture,” Vitorelli said.","“If only these events were isolated, but they are not. All the 29 dams are problematic and Vale has been disobeying the agreements to this date,” he added.","On Tuesday, the Brazilian miner said it plans to grow production capacity to 400 million tons of iron ore per year by 2022, up from 318 million today.","Of that, Vale said it expects 54 million tons of annual capacity to come from the state of Minas Gerais where the two mining disasters happened. Future actions from prosecutors potentially put some of that output increase at risk.","The task force says Vale’s response to six dams around its mines at Fabrica, Vargem Grande and Itabira are high risk and that the company’s response to improve safety has been inadequate.","For example, during a routine inspection by prosecutors in July 2019 at Itabira, auditors noticed cracks at the Itabiruçu dam. One of the cracks, they said in a written report, was 1.87-meter (6.1-ft) deep. The dam’s stability, moreover, was being monitored with equipment that produced inaccurate data or had a delay.","The miner in response to this allegation, invested 34 million reais (4.9 million pounds) in new inspection equipment, according to prosecutors. Three months after the visit, it increased the security level of the dam and reduced production levels, according to a previous company statement.","More recently, the external auditors reprimanded the company over dams that store mining waste from the Fabrica complex.","The task force said the company failed to replace a video camera that monitors safety, which had been allegedly stolen from Forquilha III, leaving the dam without proper monitoring since July 27.",Vale disputes the allegation and says the dam was never left without monitoring.,"“The company awaits external complaints before reacting, and this is systemic,” the prosecutor said."

The need to reduce the use of dams became an issue after the 2015 dam burst in Mariana at Samarco’s mine - a joint venture between Vale and Australia’s BHP Billiton Ltd.","New Steel is expected to close 2020 with 110 employees, compared to 60 when Vale bought the company.","Montenegro stressed that, with the help of New Steel, Vale expects to increase the percentage of production that is processed dry or with natural humidity from 60% to 70% by 2024.","Of the remaining percentage, which will be processed wet, more than half will have dry and filtered waste and only 14% will be destined for dams or minefields that are deactivated, as is done today with 40% of Vale’s production.

It was one of the world’s worst mining tragedies.","The final results of a complex study will not be completed until June, they say.","That delay has put the state and federal investigations out of synch, recalling the legal problems that dogged the prosecution of a similar mining disaster in Brazil in 2015.","“The charges are a bit of a surprise,” said Davi Tangerino, a lawyer and law professor at Fundação Getulio Vargas in Sao Paulo, “because of the awaited technical study.”","“I don’t think there are the concrete elements required for homicide charges, precisely because this technical part is missing,” Tangerino added.","A legal source involved in the case, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the divergence between the state and federal prosecutions was likely to be exploited by defense lawyers.","“It gives a lot of ammunition to the defense,” the source said, adding that Vale would seek to portray the lack of a technical study into the disaster as a flaw in the prosecution’s case.","On the day the charges were announced, the Rio de Janeiro-based miner and lawyers for its former chief executive officer, Fabio Schvartsman, stressed that the technical study was not yet complete.",Schvartsman’s lawyers described the murder charges as “hasty and unfair” without the investigation’s conclusions. The others charged were managers at Vale and employees of the auditing company that had vouched for the safety of the dam.,"“Fabio always cooperated with the investigations ... in the belief that any decision about criminal responsibility would be made on technical criteria. Unfortunately that’s not what happened,” his lawyers said in a statement to Reuters for this story.","Vale told Reuters in a statement it “considers it essential to have an expert, technical and scientific conclusion on the causes of the rupture ... before responsibility is pointed out.” The company said it was cooperating with authorities and helping those affected by the disaster.","State prosecutors did not immediately respond to requests for comment. When presenting the charges, they said Vale had internal information showing various dams to have an unacceptable risk profile, including the one that collapsed last year.",Federal prosecutors said they had maintained communication with their state counterparts since the start to gather evidence and secure successful prosecutions.,"For Alberto Zacharias Toron, a lawyer and professor in criminal law, the filing of the murder charges sets up a possible dispute over jurisdiction of the case, which could play into the hands of the defense.","“The Supreme Court could say the case is federal and all this work will be annulled, including the charges,” he said.","Deciding the jurisdiction of a case can be complicated, especially when it involves multiple people, areas and crimes. Certain forests and parks are federal, for example, whereas murder is often regarded as the remit of the state.","The criminal investigation into the similar Mariana dam disaster, which occurred at a mine co-owned by Vale just over three years before the one at Brumadinho, experienced long delays due to arguments over jurisdiction.","The case was finally tried in federal courts, partly because the scale of the disaster meant it polluted a federal river and impacted multiple states.","Toron, who worked for the defense during those investigations, said board members of the joint venture operating the Mariana dam were also accused of murder but the defense successfully had the charges reduced to the lesser charge of flooding resulting in death. That alone caused a seven-month delay.",Even those lesser charges were later rejected by a federal judge last September on the grounds that board members did not “exercise management roles.” Federal prosecutors have appealed.,"In the Brumadinho case, state prosecutors have focused on management, rather than board members, but it remains to be seen whether that will help secure convictions."

At least 259 people were killed here in the incident.,"Following the disaster, miners in the United States can now expect to pay 10% to 20% more to secure environmental and pollution coverage for tailings dams when policies come up for renewal, and securing that coverage has become more challenging, insurance broker Willis Towers Watson (Willis) said.","That cost rise was expected, and mining companies are set to fork out more for property and liability insurance as fewer insurers are willing to cover the riskiest aspects of the mining business.","In an industry beset with tight margins, such cost hikes are not ideal.","The United States has the second-largest number of tailings dams built using an architectural method considered unsafe by many engineers, according to a Reuters analysis of industry data.","Insurers had already begun taking steps to curb their tailings dam exposure before the Vale disaster, in the wake of at least three major dam failures globally in the past six years.","“The market has become much more risk (averse) and scrutiny is increasing,” said Andrew Wheeler, who heads the mining and natural resource practice at Willis.","Vale expects to pay about $8 billion (33.1 billion Brazilian reais) in total costs by 2031, including compensation for “material and moral damages” and efforts to clean and restore the region.","The Vale disaster has encouraged insurers to become sticklers over the wording of all types of mining policies, including property damage, business interruption and potential legal liabilities.","For example, if a policy covers $50 million for debris removal and $100 million for the loss of a tailings facility, insurers want to make it clear that a company cannot collect both amounts.","Last May, American International Group, Inc said it would no longer write any pollution liability coverage for global mining and tailings risks, according to Willis.","An AIG spokesman declined to comment on the change, which followed AIG’s earlier exit from writing U.S. and Canadian pollution liability coverage."

That investigation will take until February and could be crucial in establishing Vale’s culpability, federal prosecutor Jose Adercio Leite Sampaio said in an interview.","Federal and state prosecutors have pledged to coordinate more closely in the Brumadinho investigation, acknowledging that the probe into Brazil's last big mining disaster - a dam burst at a joint venture between Vale and Anglo-Australian miner BHP Group BHP.AX - was undermined by disputes over areas of responsibility.","Prosecutors did not make it clear whether they were planning to charge current or former executives at Vale, which has distanced itself from several people investigated after the Brumadinho disaster. Rescuers have found 259 bodies in the months following the collapse, which swamped nearby buildings, forests and waterways with mud mixed with mining waste. Another 11 people are still missing.",Lanchotti and Sampaio both agreed that Vale may need to make more governance changes to improve risk management practices.,"“The federal public prosecutors’ office has identified serious risk management and corporate governance problems that show a need for profound changes,” Sampaio said.","The Vale spokesman said the company “has always been committed to the safety of people and its structures and continues to improve its risk management processes,” adding that it had “provided all documents and information sought by the competent authorities.”"

It came less than four years after another dam collapse at a joint venture between Vale and BHP Group in the same region, an accident that experts also blamed on water weakening the solid materials composing the dam so that they behave more like a liquid - a phenomenon known as liquefaction.","Massive so-called tailing dams provide the most common waste disposal for mining companies, whether extracting iron ore, gold or copper. While prior experience indicates the dams rarely collapse because of a single cause, the Brumadinho disaster was set in motion by several factors, including poor internal drainage and intense rain that helped cause the excess water, the four-expert panel said.","Vale and its top executives at the time of the disaster have been assailed by politicians and prosecutors for failing to prevent the disaster, despite what critics say were ample warning signs. But the panel’s report said there were “no apparent signs of distress prior to failure.”","The disaster has weighed heavily on Vale’s share price, which is still around 5% lower than the day before the Jan. 25 disaster, while the broader Bovespa index has risen 18% to an all-time high. On Thursday, the shares ticked 1.4% higher.","The panel’s chairman Peter Robertson sidestepped questions at a Sao Paulo news conference about whether the report showed Vale did enough to prevent the disaster and was aware of the risk, saying questions of liability were being examined by a separate panel.","The other committee is still investigating and there is no timeline for when it will finalize its results, a Vale spokeswoman said.",Suspicion that liquefaction caused the Brumadinho collapse was raised by an official in Brazil’s Minas Gerais state as early as February.,"Robertson, a geotechnical consultant and former professor, said it was clear Vale and the consultants it hired to inspect the Brumadinho dam were aware of the issues with excess water.","“It’s fair to say they were aware of the high water level and they were taking actions to lower it and the water levels were slowly going down,” he said.","Vale was less aware of another issue related to high iron content in the mining waste used to build the dam’s successive levels, which promoted “bonding” that made its construction materials “potentially very brittle,” Robertson said.","The phenomenon was analogous to a bridge that becomes rusty over time, although unlike the components of a bridge, those of a tailings dam are difficult to “sample,” he said, adding the mining industry was likely to pay more attention to ire ore bonding as a risk factor going forward.","“We hope that in some way our findings will improve practices in the future so that tragedies like this won’t happen again,” he said."

Ten months and a public relations debacle later, a surfeit of lenders, including relationship banks with established ties to the miner and new lenders looking to forge a bond with one of Latin America’s most frequent borrowers, are expected to flock to the transaction.","A dearth of opportunities to lend to high-quality Latin American corporations has left banks with little option but to aggressively compete for business, giving borrowers cheap access to capital, and clout to dictate lending terms that allow for cost savings and flexibility.","“There are just too many banks in the region,” one senior banker said. “The competition in Latin America, it’s like cowboys.”","Vale, rated Ba1/BBB-, has mandated Citigroup, Credit Agricole, MUFG and SMBC to lead a new five-year revolving credit facility, according to three sources with knowledge of the financing. The leads have offered the loan at just 90bp over Libor and will launch it to additional banks on Thursday during a bank meeting in New York.",Spokespersons for Vale were not immediately available for comment.,"In the first quarter of 2019, Brazilian corporate borrowers, including paper producer Klabin, oil and gas giant Petróleo Brasileiro (Petrobras) and energy company Raízen, among others, brought to the syndicated loan market a collective US$4.85bn in loans. Banks’ appetite for some of Brazil’s strongest credits enabled the companies to price their loans at razor-thin levels between 105bp-150bp over Libor.","With Vale’s new deal, syndicated loan issuance in Latin America will tick over US$50bn, a number not reached since 2007, according to data from Refinitiv LPC.","A few jumbo transactions from blue chip borrowers have helped bloat that volume. Mexican telecommunications firm América Movil signed a US$2.5bn loan in August, Mexican oil company Petróleos Mexicanos raised a mammoth US$8bn in July and French energy company Engie obtained roughly US$6bn from banks to back its purchase of the TAG natural gas pipeline from Petrobras in April.","“We’ve seen a number of big, liquid banks with appetite in the region. Unlike the US, most banks are only focused on certain names, particularly the companies you can cross-sell. This makes pricing more competitive,” a second banker said.",Vale has long been expected to return to the syndicated loan market this year. The company has a US$3bn five-year revolving credit line it signed in May 2015 up for renewal next year and a US$2bn facility maturing in 2022.,"In January, the miner sent out a request for proposals to its relationship banks regarding a new five-year credit line. Vale held off on launching a deal after the tailings dam collapse at its Corrego do Feijão iron ore mine in Brumadinho on January 25 left at least 248 people dead.","The collapse brought into question Vale’s safety record and due diligence practices. The company was hit with various reparation costs and financial obligations related to the incident. It was also less than four years after a similar collapse at the Samarco mine in Brazil, which left 19 people dead in 2015. Vale and Anglo-Australian miner BHP own Samarco through a joint venture.","“They had to get their own house in order before the banks could be seen funding them,” a third syndicated loans banker said.","In September, Fitch Ratings removed Vale’s BBB- rating from negative watch due to improved visibility over potential costs from the tailings dam collapse. This put into motion plans for the company to return to the bank market, sources said.","“In Brazil, pricing has gotten tighter, so it’s ideal timing for Vale to return and refinance,” the first banker said.","Vale is on course to end 2019 with roughly US$18bn in adjusted Ebitda, excluding provisions related to the tailings dam, Fitch said.

That would be roughly 60% lower than the current market price.","Brazil is in the midst of overhauling its natural gas sector, reducing state-owned Petroleo Brasileiro SA’s dominance of the market amid other measures to increase competition and reduce the price of gas.","HBI fetches $250-$300 per tonne on the global market, more than three times the price of iron ore, helped by demand from countries around the world striving to cut greenhouse gas emissions to curb climate change.","The product is a compacted brick of 93% iron with low levels of contaminants.

Its production is so far restricted to locations, such as the Middle East, where gas prices are low.","Brazil Economy Minister Paulo Guedes said the government’s reforms to the gas sector aim to deliver a “cheap energy shock” to feed Brazil’s growth, saying that gas prices could be reduced by up to 50%.",Gas prices could also come down as Brazil ramps up output of its massive “pre-salt” offshore oil find.,"If Vale goes forward with HBI production, it could produce about 20 million tonnes of the material per year, accounting for about 5% of its planned future iron ore production.","Production could begin starting in the middle of the next decade, the source said."

The company repeated the claim in a statement on its website.","Reuters asked Vale for details on these moves on February 5, seven days after Schvartsman’s news conference.","In March, some five weeks later, Vale gave Reuters a list of nine dams that it said it had closed since 2014, a year before the Mariana disaster. They all were smaller structures and not the dangerous upstream type, according to Eduardo Leão, a director of the Brazilian mining regulator ANM, and another expert who reviewed the list for Reuters. Vale also listed the 10 dams that it said it planned to close, including the collapsed one at Brumadinho.","Brazilian prosecutors now are looking into Schvartsman’s declaration that Vale had already shuttered nine upstream dams in response to the 2015 collapse as part of a wider criminal probe into the company’s conduct, an individual close to the investigation said. The widening of the probe has not been previously reported.","For a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs/308r1Iy","The 2015 collapse, at its Samarco joint venture with BHP Group, killed 19 people near the town of Mariana.","“There was a lot of talk about measures being taken to avoid a repetition of what happened, but it was nothing more than talk,” the source added.",Schvartsman’s representatives at the law firm of Bottini & Tamasauskas declined to comment.,"In a statement, Vale said the original figures that Schvartsman provided were based on “information available at the time, provided by employees from the company’s ferrous metals area at the time of the (news conference) and that it had later sent revised data to Reuters and other news outlets.”","Vale said its statements surrounding the dams had been made in good faith, and added that it had done a lot to prevent a recurrence of the Mariana disaster and that much “is still being done.”",The latest development adds to the mining giant’s legal troubles. Brazilian prosecutors have said they are looking into whether senior Vale executives were aware of stability issues at Brumadinho and other dams but failed to disclose them or take adequate actions to resolve them.,"Brazilian market regulator CVM has also opened at least two different administrative probes into Vale’s handling of the disaster, while the company faces U.S. class actions and at least one investor arbitration case in Brazil.",Mining watchdog ANM is carrying out a separate investigation into the causes of the dam burst as well as whether any mining or other administrative rules were broken.,"“In my view, it’s clear that the CEO of any company, public or private, will certainly be held accountable by shareholders and the authorities for any kind of statement, especially if it is proven to be untrue,” said Luigi Bonizzato, a professor of constitutional law at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.","For a multimedia version of this story, click tmsnrt.rs/31nOCT7","Vale operates several different kinds of dams in Brazil to store the muddy detritus of its mining activity known as ""tailings."" The two that collapsed used an upstream technique in which the dam is gradually built upon a reservoir of sludge. For a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs/31riPR3","Such dams are generally cheaper to build, but they run a higher risk of water seeping under the dam and weakening the structure, mining experts told Reuters.","Chile and Peru have long banned the construction of such dams, because of the risks of collapse. In February, Brazil’s ANM banned new upstream tailings dams and told miners they had to decommission existing ones by Aug. 15, 2023, a deadline it recently pushed back by as many as four years.","Vale, the world’s largest iron ore exporter, is not the only big miner that operates upstream dams. At BHP, for example, 43% of its 67 operated dams are upstream, although only five of those are active, according to a slide presentation on its website from June, with the sole active ones among those based in Chile and Australia. BHP verified that the numbers were accurate.",Schvartsman was removed from the CEO job in early March at the urging of prosecutors who said in a letter to the board that his and other top Vale executives’ continued presence at the company posed “immeasurable risks to society.”,"In May, the company told investors that it expected to spend $1.855 billion to shutter the 10 upstream dams it planned to close.","For now, the company’s dams continue to pose risks. In May, one of the upstream dams slated to be decommissioned, called Sul Superior, came close to breaking, Brazilian regulators and Vale said, threatening to force the evacuation of 10,000 people from three historic towns.","Vale said the dam at that mine, known as Gongo Soco, was being monitored in real time by systems capable of detecting millimetric movements, as well as by drones. It added that the company in May started building a concrete containment wall 6 kilometers downstream from the dam that would be able to hold back a large portion of the tailings if the dam collapsed."

In February, Vale’s chief financial officer said senior executives had never been shown internal security documents indicating the dam was at risk of collapse.","The ICMM represents about a third of the mining industry but Butler said the standards, being drawn up by a panel of eight members with expertise on tailings, health, risk and law, could influence the wider sector.","A public consultation period will follow the release of the draft, with the new standards likely to be finalized and disseminated in the first quarter of 2020, he said.","Panel members visited Brazil in July and more recently, British Colombia, the site of a 2014 breach at Imperial Metals Corp's III.TO Mount Polley Mine, which sent billions of gallons of wastewater and sludge into waterways."

The move reflects a radical departure from the way the facilities have operated for more than a century.","Freeport, the world’s largest publicly traded copper producer, spends several hundred millions of dollars per year on tailings dams upkeep and has not had a tailings dam failure since it acquired Phelps Dodge in 2007. Adkerson’s directive underscored his desire not to blemish that record.","“I told my people, ‘If you know of a problem, don’t try to solve it yourself,’” Adkerson told Reuters. “Report it.”","On Tuesday, Adkerson and 26 other CEOs, including leaders from BHP Group Ltd, Vale SA and Glencore Plc , agreed as their first step since the Vale disaster to form a panel that will set international design and maintenance standards for dams and study ways to reduce the volume of water stored behind the dams in waste rock.","“We recognize our responsibility to offer more than just words,” said Donald Lindsey, CEO of Canadian miner Teck Resources Ltd and chair of the International Council on Mining and Metals, the industry trade group that set the standards.","“We owe it to the families impacted (by the Vale disaster) and to our stakeholders to take meaningful action,” he said.","In the weeks after the accident, Brazil’s government banned new upstream mining dams - the type of dam involved in the Vale disaster - and ordered the decommissioning of all such dams by 2021.","But Brazil and the broader mining industry have grappled with how best to codify uniform tailings dam standards, conscious of not only the safety implications but of growing public resentment over the use of tailings dams.","Right now for instance, there are no global mining industry standards defining what a tailings dam is, how to build one and how to care for it after it is decommissioned.","“I’m paranoid about tailings dams,” said Mark Bristow, CEO of Barrick Gold Corp, the world’s largest gold miner, which has assigned full-time engineers to each tailings dam.","In addition to setting global standards for the construction and inspection of tailings dams, the ICMM panel will also study ways to require so-called dry-stack tailings, where water is removed before tailings are stored, thus bolstering a dam’s safety. That likely can happen relatively soon, the ICMM said.","Longer term, ICMM said that in situ mining - in which an acid is pumped underground to leach out copper and other minerals - could become the industry standard, thus eliminating the need for tailings dams entirely.","“We absolutely agree that a fundamental change is required in the industry’s collective approach to safe tailings management,” said BHP CEO Andrew Mackenzie at the BMO Metals & Mining Conference in Florida, where the ICMM approved the panel’s formation.","The new standards to be set by ICMM will apply to all members, regardless of location. Past practices favored a more tailored approach.","The Vale disaster “led us to reconsider how we look at tailings dams and acknowledge we need a step-change,” said Tom Butler, ICMM’s CEO.","Tailings dams in wet locations, for instance, had been held to a higher standard because they were more prone to erosion.

(Reuters) - After last month’s deadly tailings dam disaster at a Vale SA facility in Brazil, Freeport-McMoRan Inc Chief Executive Richard Adkerson sent a memo to his 29,000 employees telling them to immediately report any safety concerns about the scores of dams his company operates.","The disaster, which killed more than 300, has sparked a push to set global standards for the construction and inspection of tailings dams, which store the muddy detritus of the mining process, as well as emergency preparations. The move reflects a radical departure from the way the facilities have operated for more than a century.","Freeport, the world’s largest publicly traded copper producer, spends several hundred millions of dollars per year on tailings dams upkeep and has not had a tailings dam failure since it acquired Phelps Dodge in 2007. Adkerson’s directive underscored his desire not to blemish that record.","“I told my people, ‘If you know of a problem, don’t try to solve it yourself,’” Adkerson told Reuters. “Report it.”","On Tuesday, Adkerson and 26 other CEOs, including leaders from BHP Group Ltd, Vale SA and Glencore Plc, agreed as their first step since the Vale disaster to form a panel that will set international design and maintenance standards for dams and study ways to reduce the volume of water stored behind the dams in waste rock.","“We recognize our responsibility to offer more than just words,” said Donald Lindsey, CEO of Canadian miner Teck Resources Ltd and chair of the International Council on Mining and Metals, the industry trade group that set the standards.","“We owe it to the families impacted (by the Vale disaster) and to our stakeholders to take meaningful action,” he said.","In the weeks after the accident, Brazil’s government banned new upstream mining dams - the type of dam involved in the Vale disaster - and ordered the decommissioning of all such dams by 2021.","But Brazil and the broader mining industry have grappled with how best to codify uniform tailings dam standards, conscious of not only the safety implications but of growing public resentment over the use of tailings dams.","Right now for instance, there are no global mining industry standards defining what a tailings dam is, how to build one and how to care for it after it is decommissioned.","“I’m paranoid about tailings dams,” said Mark Bristow, CEO of Barrick Gold Corp, the world’s largest gold miner, which has assigned full-time engineers to each tailings dam.","In addition to setting global standards for the construction and inspection of tailings dams, the ICMM panel will also study ways to require so-called dry-stack tailings, where water is removed before tailings are stored, thus bolstering a dam’s safety. That likely can happen relatively soon, the ICMM said.","Longer term, ICMM said that in situ mining - in which an acid is pumped underground to leach out copper and other minerals - could become the industry standard, thus eliminating the need for tailings dams entirely.","“We absolutely agree that a fundamental change is required in the industry’s collective approach to safe tailings management,” said BHP CEO Andrew Mackenzie at the BMO Metals & Mining Conference in Florida, where the ICMM approved the panel’s formation.","The new standards to be set by ICMM will apply to all members, regardless of location. Past practices favored a more tailored approach.","The Vale disaster “led us to reconsider how we look at tailings dams and acknowledge we need a step-change,” said Tom Butler, ICMM’s CEO.","Tailings dams in wet locations, for instance, had been held to a higher standard because they were more prone to erosion. But the new standards will favor a uniform approach that industry CEOs hope will greatly reduce the potential for another disaster.","“We cannot have a sense of complacency about this,” Freeport’s Adkerson said."

BHP also produces this type of iron, as well as some lower grades, while Fortescue mainly mines 58 percent iron ore.","Smaller Australian miners are also likely capable of adding a few million more tonnes to the market, most likely by the second half of 2019, if they take the view that the current price spike is sustainable.","South Africa, the third-biggest supplier to China behind Australia and Brazil, is unlikely to add significant volumes to the seaborne market because of capacity constraints, although its higher-grade iron ore would likely find willing buyers.","The problem for Chinese steel mills in switching to lower quality iron ore is that more ore is needed to produce the same amount of steel, and thus more coking coal is also needed.","This adds to costs, but also risks causing issues with authorities, who are still keen to limit pollution from heavy industry as part of national efforts to improve air quality.","The second option of continuing to use higher grade ores, but lowering output, is unlikely to appeal to steel mills given the recovery in steel prices, which encourages production.","The third of option of paying whatever it takes in order to secure supplies of higher-grade iron ore will only work if profit margins remain strong, and this will need steel prices to rise in tandem with iron ore prices.","So far, the prices for different grades of iron ore have not diverged much since the dam disaster, with 62-percent grade MT-IO-QIN62=ARG and 58-percent MT-IO-QIN58=ARG, as assessed by Argus Media, both gaining just over 20 percent since the event of Jan. 25.","Somewhat surprisingly, despite Vale being the biggest producer of higher-grade material, 65-percent iron ore MT-IO-QIN65=ARG has slightly underperformed, gaining only 17 percent to close at $104.35 a tonne on Monday.","Perhaps Chinese steel mills find a price of more than $100 a tonne for iron ore too rich, which may suggest that their preferred option may be to start using more lower-quality ore.

A U.S. law firm filed a shareholder class action lawsuit against the company in New York, seeking to recover investment losses.","Igor Lima, a fund manager at Galt Capital in Rio, said the severe threats from the government and prosecutors drove the shares even lower than many analysts had estimated.","“This reaction has brought quite a lot of uncertainty about the size of the financial punishment Vale will have to handle”, he said.","Senator Renan Calheiros, who is in the thick of a Senate leadership race, on Twitter called for Vale’s top management to be removed urgently “out of respect for the victims ... and to avoid any destruction of evidence.”","One of Vale’s lawyers, Sergio Bermudes, told newspaper Folha de S. Paulo that management should not leave the company and said that Calheiros was trying to profit politically from the tragedy.","Vale’s senior executives have apologized for the disaster but have not accepted responsibility, saying the installations met the highest industry standards.","Brazil’s top prosecutor, Raquel Dodge, said the company should be held strongly responsible and criminally prosecuted. Executives could also be personally held responsible, she said.","The disaster at the Corrego do Feijao mine occurred less than four years after a dam collapsed at a nearby mine run by Samarco Mineracao SA, a joint venture by Vale and BHP Billiton, killing 19 and dumping toxic sludge in a major river.","While the 2015 Samarco disaster unleashed about five times more mining waste, Friday’s dam break was far deadlier as the wall of mud hit Vale’s local offices, including a crowded cafeteria, and tore through a populated area downhill.","“The cafeteria was in a risky area,” Renato Simao de Oliveiras, 32, said while searching for his twin brother, a Vale employee, at an emergency response station. “Just to save money, even if it meant losing the little guy. ... These businessmen, they only think about themselves.”","As search efforts continued on Monday, firefighters laid down wood planks to cross a sea of sludge that is hundreds of meters wide in places, to reach a bus in search of bodies inside. Villagers discovered the bus as they tried to rescue a nearby cow stuck in the mud.",Longtime resident Ademir Rogerio cried as he surveyed the mud where Vale’s facilities once stood on the edge of town.,"“The world is over for us,” he said. “Vale is the top mining company in the world.

He said Vale royalties made up about 60 percent of the town’s 140 million reais in revenue last year.","Siani said a donation of 100,000 reais will be made to each family that lost a relative in the disaster and said Vale would step up investments in dam safety.","The board of Vale, which has raised its dividends over the last year, suspended all shareholder payouts and executive bonuses late on Sunday, as the disaster put its corporate strategy under scrutiny.","Since the disaster, courts have order a freeze on 11.8 billion reais of Vale’s assets to cover damages. State and federal authorities have slapped it with 349 million reais of administrative fines.","German insurer Allianz SE may have to cover some of the costs of the dam collapse, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters.","“I’m not a mining technician. I followed the technicians’ advice and you see what happened. It didn’t work,” Vale CEO Fabio Schvartsman said in a TV interview. “We are 100 percent within all the standards, and that didn’t do it.”","Many wondered if the state of Minas Gerais, named for the mining industry that has shaped its landscape for centuries, should have higher standards.","“There are safe ways of mining,” said Joao Vitor Xavier, head of the mining and energy commission in the state assembly. “It’s just that it diminishes profit margins, so they prefer to do things the cheaper way – and put lives at risk.”","Reaction to the disaster could threaten the plans of Brazil’s newly inaugurated president to relax restrictions on the mining industry, including proposals to open up indigenous reservations and large swaths of the Amazon jungle for mining.","Environment Minister Ricardo Salles said in a TV interview on Monday that Brazil should create new regulation for mining dams, replacing wet tailings dams with dry mining methods.",Mines and Energy Minister Bento Albuquerque proposed in a Sunday newspaper interview that the law be changed to assign responsibility in cases such as Brumadinho to the people responsible for certifying the safety of mining dams.,"“Current law does not prevent disasters like the one we saw on Brumadinho,” he said. “The model for verifying the state of mining dams will have to be reconsidered. The model isn’t good.”"

Executives could also be personally held responsible, she said.","HSBC and Jefferies have already cut their recommendations for the shares to hold from buy. Other analysts have held back, saying they are trying to figure out potential damages. A law firm filed a class-action lawsuit against Vale and its top executives in a New York court.","Previ, Brazil’s largest pension fund and a major shareholder at the mining company, said in a statement that it could absorb the impact from the steep share price drop without the need to eventually sell any of its holdings.","“Billions of dollars in Vale’s assets have already been frozen as we discussed this weekend,” said Michael Underhill, chief investment officer at Capital Innovations LLC in Milwaukee, adding that the lost production from the affected mine could be made up elsewhere in Vale’s system.","“There remains a fair chance that all of Vale’s dams (which exceed 100 in count) will also be coming under great scrutiny going forward,” said Underhill.","Vale bond prices also fell, with the yield on its August 2026 bonds jumping to 5.7 percent from 4.6 percent early on Friday before the dam bust, according to Market Axess Bondticker.","Fitch downgraded the company’s debt on Monday to BBB- and placed it on ratings watch negative. Late on Friday, Standard & Poor’s put Vale’s debt under review for possible downgrade.","So far, Brazilian courts have issued orders to freeze 11.8 billion reais ($3.1 billion) in Vale’s accounts to cover rescue efforts and damages. The company had around 24 billion reais in cash and equivalents at the end of the third quarter.","Analysts at Credit Suisse said in a note to clients they anticipated regulatory changes for tailings dams because it was the second disaster in less than four years, after the fatal 2015 dam burst at Samarco Mineracao, a joint venture by Vale and BHP Group."

That has created an opening for suppliers of higher-quality ore such as Vale.","“What will define Chinese demand for iron ore is continued urbanization, infrastructure investments, auto production,” Siani said, adding that the Chinese government tends to stimulate internal demand when the economy slows down.","Chinese iron ore futures hit their highest level in almost eight months on Monday, supported by firm demand for the raw ingredient in steel as stockpiles at ports dropped last week.","Still, Siani said it was hard to make forecasts beyond 2019.","The Chinese government is trying to make peace with Brazilian President-elect Jair Bolsonaro, whose China-bashing threatens to chill a profitable trading relationship that has benefited both countries.","Siani said a business plan for Samarco, a joint venture of Vale and BHP Ltd in Brazil, had been sent to the company’s creditors this week, a key step toward resuming operations at the troubled iron ore mine.","The Samarco mine has been paralyzed since 2015, when a tailings dam burst, killing 19 people and devastating a major watershed in Brazil’s worst man-made environmental disaster.","Last month, Chief Executive Officer Fabio Schvartsman said he thought the mine could resume production in 2020, after Samarco, Vale and BHP inked a deal with Brazilian authorities settling a 20 billion reais ($5.3 billion) lawsuit.","Vale, the world’s largest nickel producer, is still struggling with plans for that segment. The company has been seeking without luck to find a partner to invest in its New Caledonia nickel mine. Speculation has swirled over whether it could mothball the project.","“I would say the pendulum is swinging more in the direction of keeping the asset (operating) because of its strategic importance to the electric vehicle market,” Siani said.","The nickel mine needs a $350 million investment in a waste deposit system to continue functioning, he added.","Siani ruled out investing in lithium, reiterating that the company was seeking out small, cheap acquisitions near current operations, in minerals that the company already mines.
