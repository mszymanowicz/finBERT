But of course, where we currently see an explosion of ... five to ten times more - that will normalise.”",Ecolab said on Thursday that two products - a hand-rub and a surface disinfectant - had been shown to be specifically effective against SARS-CoV-2 following tests in Germany.,The World Health Organization says the coronavirus can be spread via surfaces though the main route is through droplets.,"British health minister Matt Hancock has said society should start getting back to normal after Easter, but that increased hand-washing was a “no regrets thing” that would become commonplace.","De Boo said: “In the past, when you did not see, let’s say any dirt or any soil, you felt it was clean and it was trusted. People who have ... lived through this pandemic, I think, will have a very different understanding on that going forward.",“I think there is a mindset change.” (Writing by Alistair Smout; editing by Stephen Addison)

Well completions in Texas, home of the largest shale field, are down about 16% from a year ago.","The deal is worth $3.89 billion based on Apergy’s closing price on Wednesday. Apergy also will assume $492 million in debt from the acquisition, which gives the deal an enterprise value of about $4.4 billion .","Analysts at investment bank Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co said the price tag “appears lofty at first blush but we’d argue this isn’t out of the expectations fairway for a business like this”.","The deal will bring stable oilfield chemicals revenue, helping balance the volatility of equipment sale, the investment bank said.",Apergy shares were up 6% at $32.52 in early trading.
