Those programs do not tabulate the votes themselves.","Tyler said it is cooperating with the FBI, which has declined to comment. It declined to say which customers had detected improper logins or when those suspected intrusions occurred.","A great number of criminals use ransomware to encrypt a target’s files and demand payment, and many city departments have been forced to pay thousands or even millions of dollars in the past few years.","Because many counties run elections, the Department of Homeland Security has warned generally that ransomware that strikes them could disrupt voting, or use that threat to extort more money.","In addition, some major criminal groups and countries have used ransomware as a distraction while they remove data or destroy it.",The Department of Homeland Security did not immediately return a message seeking comment.

Because this is an active investigation, we will not provide any additional specifics relating to our incident response or our investigation at this time,” said the company, based in Plano, Texas.","“All indications are that the impact of this incident is limited to our internal corporate network and phone systems, and that there has been no impact on software we host for our clients. Our hosted environment is separate and segregated from our internal corporate environment.”",The company said Wednesday it had notified law enforcement and brought in security specialists.,"The hack prompted wide concern among local officials because some of Tyler’s programs are used to display election results, and U.S. intelligence agencies recently warned that foreign governments might try to sow mistrust by altering sites that report votes, which is seen as easier than changing the results themselves.","Some clients also said they were worried the hacker could use Tyler’s administrative access to breach local versions of its programs, such as those for dispatching emergency responders.","Though Thursday’s disclosures make those scenarios less likely, they do not rule them out. Some national governments have worked in league with ransomware gangs or used the malicious programs as cover for espionage or destructive missions.","Tyler, the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security all declined to answer questions on the extent of the hack, the risk of related breaches and the suspected identity of the perpetrators."

The company did not say whether there had been a ransomware demand or how it had learned of the breach, and it did not respond to questions.",The FBI and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security warned this week that foreign hackers might attempt to access and alter websites reporting election results. Neither responded to requests for comment after East Coast working hours.,"In the email to customers, Tyler said there had been a “security incident involving unauthorized access to our internal phone and information technology systems by an unknown third party.”",The email did not say what internal systems were breached.,"“We currently have no reason to believe that any client data, client servers, or hosted systems were affected,” it said.","Although election results and their reporting are a major concern for security officials, a financially motivated attack could wreak havoc as well if it spread to Tyler’s customers.","Mike Hamilton, chief information security officer at CI Security, said counties should immediately reset the passwords they use to log into Tyler’s systems. Tyler can log in remotely to some software it sells, and so it is safest to assume that the hackers could do so as well, said Hamilton, who is a former chief information security officer for the city of Seattle.","Since the breach at Tyler may have happened some time ago, it is possible that any stored passwords might have already been taken and used, Hamilton said."
