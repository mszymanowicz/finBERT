The overall offering size over the next three months of $54 billion is more than recommended by the Treasury Borrowing Advisory Committee.","A senior Treasury official told reporters strong demand was anticipated for the 20-year bond, and that the difference was partly due to the committee’s estimate having been formulated before the coronavirus outbreak.","“It’s clear that the Treasury is starting to finance out the debt faster than most people anticipated.
