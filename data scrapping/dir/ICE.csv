Traders often purchase physical deliveries through the ICE Futures U.S. contract. That sugar can come from one of 29 origins, according to the exchange website.","The amendment ensures that sugar delivered against the No 11 contract from any of those origins cannot be sent into the United States under the CAFTA quota, ICE said in a notice published on Tuesday.",The rules of delivery against the No 11 previously had a similar rule that applied to any similar preferential agreements for sugar into the European Union.,"The change is effective with the March 2019 expiry, the notice said.
