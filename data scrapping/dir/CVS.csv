The two pharmacies are working with about 40% of the state’s facilities. Some of those were told that they were scheduled for February or March, said Dr. Joe Thompson, former Arkansas surgeon general and chief executive of the Arkansas Center for Health Improvement","“This is not acceptable,” said Thompson. “We’re seeing a failure in deployment by CVS and Walgreens.”","Federal health officials in recent days have urged broadening vaccine eligibility to tens of millions of Americans to speed the national inoculation program rollout. Meanwhile, seniors at some long-term care facilities - who account for about 1% of the U.S. population but 40% of COVID-19 deaths and were supposed to be at the front of the line - continue to wait.","State and local officials and long-term care operators in states including Florida, California, Arizona, Indiana and Pennsylvania told Reuters they have turned to alternative providers for vaccinations for their residents or staff because the pharmacy chains were scheduling shots weeks out.","Some 75,000 long-term care facilities signed up to receive vaccines from CVS Health Corp and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc under the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s (CDC) Pharmacy Partnership Program.","“I think they face serious bandwidth issues in terms of scheduling,” said David Grabowski, a Harvard Medical School professor and healthcare policy expert. “I find it very distressing that we haven’t been doing this more rapidly. This is really a matter of life or death.”",Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson in a statement on Thursday said the two pharmacy chains assured him that all long-term care residents assigned to them would be vaccinated by the end of this month.,"Many states prioritized homes with patients requiring medical care, which contributed to delays at other long-term care facilities.","CVS said it plans to finish all shots at assigned facilities within nine to 12 weeks of the first dose. That means states like California, Florida, Arizona, Alabama, Oklahoma and Pennsylvania, which were among the last to activate the second-phase of facility vaccinations, may not be finished until April.","“State decisions on which facilities are activated when have a significant impact on timing,” CVS spokesman T.J. Crawford said, noting that the company has administered 1 million shots and is on track with its federal agreement.","Others hurdles included confirming vaccine availability, the winter holidays, vaccine hesitancy and fresh COVID-19 outbreaks, the companies said.","That resulted in “a little bit slower start than what we were hoping for.

U.S. regulators approved a joint COVID-19 and flu test in July.,"The same people who are most vulnerable to risks from COVID-19, such as the elderly and those with respiratory conditions, are also at greatest risk for the flu, Tan added.","The U.S. healthcare system is already expected to be strained in the fall by a resurgence in COVID-19. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation is anticipating an uptick in COVID-19 cases in the coming months, resulting in around 300,000 total deaths by December, up from the current figure of roughly 160,000, and a nearly 75% increase in hospitalizations.","There is evidence that social distancing measures for COVID-19 reduce the transmission rate of the flu as well, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, meaning that continued measures in the U.S. could potentially slow flu transmission this season.","However, efforts to inoculate patients for the flu could be complicated by the need to safeguard patients and healthcare workers from COVID-19.","“If a patient has a fever or other symptoms associated with illness, they will be referred to their healthcare provider and immunizations will be deferred,” a Walgreens spokeswoman told Reuters.","CVS plans to begin inoculating patients earlier than usual - possibly by the end of this month - to get a jump start on preparing for this year’s flu season, which usually starts around October.","However, studies show there is a risk that getting inoculated against the flu too early can leave a patient vulnerable to contracting the virus later on in winter, if the shot wears off.","Other physicians are also starting this month, though it will still take months to fully distribute all the needed inoculations, Tan said.","The flu vaccine “comes out over time so you want to make sure people continue to seek flu vaccines” through Thanksgiving and beyond, Tan said.

Rival Walgreens Boots Alliance WBA.O reported a similar trend when it announced quarterly results last month.","“We are seeing that as shelter-in orders are lifting, and we return our hours of operation to normal hours, we’re beginning to see sales improve,” said Chief Operating Officer Jonathan Roberts.","The company was seeing some benefit from its prescription home delivery initiatives, and highlighted efforts to expand COVID-19 testing. The company expects to have up to 1,000 locations across the country offering self-swab coronavirus tests.","“I will say that the nature of our business is, to a degree, recession resistant,” Chief Executive Larry Merlo said on a conference call.","Sales at CVS’ retail unit jumped 7.7% to $22.75 billion in the first quarter, helped by strength in its pharmacy and over-the-counter consumer health products.","Aetna fared well in the first quarter as it spent less on medical claims, with patients staying away from doctors’ offices and hospitals over coronavirus fears and elective procedures were delayed or canceled to preserve capacity for COVID-19 patients.","That trend continued in April, with a 30% decline in use of medical services overall and 50% drop in laboratory and radiology services.","The company’s large pharmacy benefits business also benefited from consumer stockpiling of medicines in the first quarter, but the company said that trend had since reversed. Sales rose 4.2% to $34.98 billion.","CVS said it had an adjusted first-quarter profit of $1.91 per share, topping analysts’ average expectations by 28 cents, according to Refinitiv IBES data.","Overall sales rose 8.3% to $66.76 billion, beating estimates by $2.66 billion."

It had announced last year that it was working on a home hemodialysis system, which would enable patients with end stage renal disease to have more frequent dialysis and potentially better health outcomes compared with clinic-based care.","Without a transplant, patients with end-stage kidney disease require dialysis to clear their blood of waste and excess fluid, which involves spending three-to-five hours hooked up to a machine three times a week.","The U.S. government, which covers most patients with end stage renal disease in its Medicare health program, last week announced plans for several pilot programs aimed at overhauling kidney care.

DaVita has said that it is accelerating home dialysis growth by investing in home remote monitoring and a telehealth platform that make the process easier.","CVS Executive Vice President Alan Lotvin said in an interview that by using its home dialysis equipment, patients are expected to undergo dialysis every other day for around 6 hours per day, potentially doubling the amount of dialysis they receive in a one-week period.

In the trial, patients are trained for about six weeks with a nurse either at a clinic or at home and then operate the system themselves for six weeks.","Nurses and medical workers are one of the factors that drive the costs of dialysis in centers and can be a factor in home care costs. Doctors are also typically reimbursed when patients receive dialysis, a factor government officials have said undercuts earlier treatment of kidney disease.",DaVita shares have gained 12 percent this year since closing 2018 at $51.42.
