And the surge in absentee ballots due to concerns over the coronavirus pandemic overwhelmed election officials.","Heeding the stark warning ahead of Election Day on Nov. 3, U.S. companies are aiming to facilitate what is expected to be a chaotic 2020 U.S. presidential election.

Starbucks is also urging its over 200,000 U.S. employees register to vote from its mobile app.","“We know that barriers exist, notably in Black and Brown communities throughout the nation, that lend to systemic racism and require greater voter access and protections,” Johnson said in an internal memo on Aug. 27. “No (employee) will have to choose between working their shift or voting on or before Election Day.”","Rules securing time off for workers to vote vary by state. In New York, workers can be paid for up to two hours to vote, but they may be required to give advance notice. In Alabama, workers get one hour of unpaid time.","“Voting is always important, but the degree of partisan polarization this year seems to be extraordinarily high. This makes the stakes of the election unusually high as well,” said Jonathan Entin, professor of political science at Case Western Reserve University.","Partisan battles over expanding mail-in voting amid the pandemic have threatened to snarl the political process where more than a third of registered voters are expected to do so by mail or vote early in person, according to a survey published in August from Democracy Fund + UCLA Nationscape project.","President Donald Trump for months has railed against voting by mail citing unfounded fraud concerns and last week encouraged supporters to vote twice, once by mail and again in person, compounding the confusion ahead of Election Day.","Nearly half of voters fear difficulties with voting in the U.S. presidential elections, according to a voter survey by Pew Research.","Companies including Tiffany & Co TIF.N, Levi Strauss LEVI.N and Walmart WMT.N have offered paid time off or flexible hours to workers.","“If any employee needs extra time to vote or work at the polls, they can simply work with their managers on creating a flexible schedule,” a spokesman for packaged food company Conagra Brands CAG.N said.","Some companies, including Kraft Heinz KHC.O and Target TGT.N, have also set up websites to guide employees on registering to vote and learning about candidates in partnership with the League of Women Voters and the National Association of Manufacturers.","Several states have warned in recent months that they may not have enough poll workers, with Maryland at one point estimating it was short 14,000 people.

Covid-19 has given many businesses a beating, but not vegan egg maker Just. The company says it’s likely to pursue an initial public offering earlier than planned, Reuters reported on Wednesday, after sales grew 150% from April to June, year-over-year. Scrambling the recent trend for loss-making IPOs, Just wants an operating profit before it hits the public market.","Even without a pandemic, vegan food was a hot investment category. Shares of Beyond Meat are up more than 80% since its IPO last year. True, bean-based ovo-substitutes are a tougher sell. But the total addressable market, a staple data point for hotshot IPOs, is huge. Around 1.4 trillion chicken eggs are consumed annually, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization.","Aiming to turn an operating profit before going public – which Beyond Meat did not – is wise, if only because Just’s history is complex. Once known as Hampton Creek, it weathered a federal inquiry into fake sales and a mass director walkout before renaming as Eat Just. Getting its ducks in a row is just good business. (By Jennifer Saba)","TARGET PRACTICE. It’s not just products but preparedness that distinguishes retailers in a pandemic. U.S. chain Target’s shares shot up more than 12% on Wednesday after its second-quarter revenue grew by one-quarter. More impressive is that about 17% of sales came from online orders, more than doubling from just over 7% in the same period last year. That switch didn’t impact its operating profit margin either, since the higher cost of delivery was offset by fewer discounts and cost cuts elsewhere.","The reason is that Target started early. The company bought same-day delivery platform Shipt in 2017 for $550 million and has tacked on in-store and drive-by delivery too. A retailer building e-commerce from scratch would struggle to process the equivalent of 10% of its pre-pandemic sales through digital channels at short notice. That also meant that Target’s 195% growth in e-commerce revenue outpaced even giant rival Walmart, whose digital sales almost doubled over the same period. Self-help pays off. (By Amanda Gomez)","NOT TOO BAD. U.S. President Donald Trump claimed New Zealand was suffering from a “terrible” surge in Covid-19 infections this week, using it as an example of something he wanted to avoid. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, coping with six coronavirus cases on Wednesday, took exception, noting that the United States is still handling “tens of thousands” of new cases each day. She has a point: Vermont, the least-hit U.S. state, has an infection rate seven times that of New Zealand.","The fresh outbreak is frustrating; it pushed Auckland back into lockdown and led Ardern to delay an election. The Kiwi economy, notably tourism, is suffering from a ban on visitors, and Westpac analysts predict second-quarter GDP will decline by 13.5%. But domestic activity is strong enough for the government to delay some planned stimulus. The crisis isn’t over – a case has been found in the Hobbiton tourist attraction – but it’s far from terrible. (By Jennifer Hughes)","TRAVELLING FASTER. Since Covid-19 went global in March, public health has largely taken precedence over economic concerns. That’s still the case in New Zealand, but in Britain, a shift is visible. The government now hopes that airport tests can replace quarantines for travellers from some countries. A change will please airlines like Ryanair and easyJet, whose reopening plans have been thrown into disarray.","The UK government’s thinking seems to be that European Covid-related deaths are not rising as fast as cases, and improved tests and more effective tracing can keep the situation under control until vaccines start arriving, hopefully early next year. If that attitude spreads, Germany’s expected extension of its pandemic furlough scheme to 24 months will look excessive. A surge in Covid-19 hospitalisations would lead to a fast U-turn, but if that doesn’t happen, governments may be less cautious about pushing harder for an economic take-off. (By Ed Cropley)","STICKER SHOCK. Predicting long-term consumer price trends has always been hard. These days even short-term forecasting is proving difficult. UK inflation accelerated to 1% in July from 0.6% in June, official data showed on Wednesday. The reading was above all forecasts in a Reuters poll of economists. It mirrored the bigger-than-expected rise in U.S. consumer prices reported on Aug. 12.","Gathering data, a big problem during strict lockdown, is now straightforward. And petrol prices, which boosted inflation on both sides of the Atlantic, are easy enough to track. But the pandemic has disrupted consumer and retail behaviour. In Britain, clothing and footwear prices were the biggest contributors to the rise in the inflation rate because the normal summer discounting was brought forward to the lockdown months. Still, the upside inflation surprises don’t change the big picture. At current levels of activity, high and sustained inflation is some way off. (By Swaha Pattanaik)"

But operating income continues to reflect near-term challenges, Chief Executive Brian Cornell said on an earnings conference call.","The retailer remained confident it could hit its earlier full-year earnings outlook, however, with payoff from investments aimed at warding off competition from Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O and brick-and-mortar rivals expected to pick up later this year.","“The key message from Target’s first-quarter results was the company’s ability to drive transaction growth, but not without investment spending and margin pressures,” Morningstar analysts wrote in a research note.",Target’s operating income margin weakened to 6.2 percent in the first quarter from 7.1 percent a year ago.,"The retailer said margins should improve as seasonal merchandise sales rebound after a delayed spring, pricing investments made last year deliver results, customers react positively to new private-label brands and it focuses on cost-cutting.","Morningstar expects online sales, higher costs associated with delivery and price competition will continue to weigh, however, and did not anticipate a sizeable change to its 5.9 percent average operating margin projection over the next decade.","The retailer has poured billions of dollars into aggressively promoting its products, remodeling stores and keeping grocery prices low to compete with Walmart and supermarket chain Kroger Co KR.N.",It cut its next-day delivery fee for household essentials to $2.99 from $4.99 last week and waived it for customers paying with a Target card.,The retailer said on Wednesday it is rolling out a new drive-up service where shoppers can pick up orders in an hour.,"It is also expanding its delivery services through Shipt, a same-day delivery company it bought for $550 million last year, and partnering with courier services on same-day orders in metro areas.",Amazon’s purchase of Whole Foods rattled the grocery industry on worries the online seller would quickly ramp up delivery of fresh food.,"Last week, Whole Foods debuted a loyalty program for Amazon Prime customers and Kroger said it would partner with British online grocer Ocado OCDO.L to build robot-operated warehouses to support U.S. home delivery.","Target has said it plans $3 billion of capital expenditure this year on its supply chain, online delivery, its own brands and merging online and in-store shopping.",The retailer maintained its full-year forecast of a low to single digit increase in comparable sales and adjusted earnings of $5.15 to $5.45 per share.,"Target shares, which tumbled more than 8 percent in pre-market trade, were last down 5.4 percent at $71.37.",Gross margins remained under pressure at 29.8 percent compared to 30 percent last year. The measure had hit a 20-year low of 26.2 percent in the fourth quarter.,"First-quarter same-store sales were slightly higher than estimates, rising 3 percent. Analysts expected a 2.9 percent increase, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.","In February last year, Target said it would reinvest more than $7 billion through 2020. Cornell said shoppers are reacting positively to remodeled stores, investments in merchandising and speedy delivery.","Strong sales growth in home, essentials, food and beverages, offset weaker sales in weather-sensitive categories.","Online sales rose 28 percent in the first quarter, up from a 21 percent rise a year ago but below the 29 percent rise in the fourth quarter.","Excluding items, Minneapolis-based Target earned a profit of$1.32 per share in the quarter ended May 5, below the average analyst estimate of $1.39.","The big-box chain forecast adjusted earnings of $1.30 to $1.50 per share for the second quarter, compared to the average analyst estimate of $1.35 per share.","First-quarter selling, general and administrative expenses rose to 21.1 percent of sales from 20.7 percent a year ago.","In October, the company said it would hike wages for hourly workers to $12 per hour this spring and $15 per hour by 2020.","Revenue rose to $16.78 billion, topping the average estimate of $16.58 billion.",Shares of the Minneapolis-based chain have risen 16 percent in 2018 and more than 35 percent in the past 12 months.
