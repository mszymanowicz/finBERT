The offering did not go ahead.,Mortgage firms have struggled to attract investors to share offerings due to concerns mortgage activity may have peaked in 2020 as consumers took advantage of historically low interest rates to refinance existing home loans.,"Earlier this month, mortgage lender loanDepot Inc slashed its IPO size and share sale price to ensure it could complete its listing.","Vecchione told Reuters he believed Western Alliance was getting “a fairly priced deal,” and the bank used AmeriHome’s 2019 financial results when evaluating whether to buy the company, to allow for last year’s elevated business levels.","AmeriHome Chief Executive Jim Furash, who will continue to lead the company as a unit within Western Alliance post-completion, added that AmeriHome’s business was weighted more towards new mortgages, which sheltered it from lower refinancing activity expected in 2021.","Evercore and Guggenheim Securities were the financial advisers to Western Alliance on the deal, which is expected to close in the second quarter of 2021. Houlihan Lokey Capital and Wells Fargo Securities advised AmeriHome."
