But that deal fell apart in April, weighed down by the pandemic’s crippling effect on travel and planemakers.","On Friday, Embraer reported its best quarter so far during the COVID-19 pandemic, narrowing losses to just $3 million while delivering more jets in the period than in the first nine months of the year combined.","But it remains unclear if the worst has passed for Embraer or if more challenges lie ahead, because so much of the company’s 2021 sales happened in the last three months of the year. The fourth quarter already tended to be Embraer’s strongest before the pandemic.","The world’s No. 3 planemaker will not issue forward-looking guidance because it says its outlook remains uncertain, but noted that it had had no commercial jet orders canceled and that it had finished downsizing its workforce.","Overall in 2020, Embraer lost $732 million, more than double its loss for 2019, weighed down by its commercial aviation unit, which is also its main business line.","Deliveries fell by half from 2019. While the planemaker delivered 28 commercial jets in the fourth quarter, it only delivered 16 in the previous 9 months.","The result was that Embraer’s fourth-quarter revenue came in at $1.8 billion, just 12% lower than a year earlier, even though full-year revenue was down 31%."

So far this year, Embraer has already lost $728 million, and the company only expects growth to resume perhaps in 2022.","Shares fell 6% in Brazil on the news and the negative outlook, even as markets overall were up.","But Embraer said on Tuesday it had already delivered more planes in October than in all of the third quarter, a promising sign that could darken down the line if the resurging pandemic is not tamed.","Commercial jet revenue was the hardest hit, falling to $177 million in the quarter from $408 million a year ago as the pandemic ravaged commercial travel.","But the executive jets division, which some analysts believed would be a bright spot as the ultra rich would spend heavily to travel in isolation, also fell significantly. Executive jets revenue fell to $212 million from $363 million a year ago.","Its defense division, however, managed to grow its revenue on higher deliveries of military planes. Still, Embraer’s defense division remains a smaller business segment than the one making civilian planes.","The company said it burned through $567 million in cash during the quarter, which was offset by $750 million in new debt raised in the same period."

Boeing says it backed out because Embraer failed to meet unnamed conditions.","Potential dealbreakers are often described in contracts as material adverse events. But Boeing and Embraer wrote out a laundry list in the contract signed in January 2019, which Reuters reviewed, of 10 conditions that would not qualify as the kind of material adverse events that could be a pretext for cancelling the deal. A pandemic and any changes to the global economy were among them.","On Wednesday, S&P lowered Boeing’s credit rating to just one notch above junk. Meanwhile, the U.S. planemaker announced it would lay off 16,000 people - close to the total number of workers Embraer employs - and that it had already drawn down its entire credit line and was working on a bond offering.","“We will be a smaller company for a while,” Boeing Chief Executive David Calhoun said on Wednesday after the planemaker disclosed quarterly results.","However, just days earlier, when Boeing called off its deal with Embraer, the U.S. planemaker did not mention adverse conditions within the company or the economy. Instead, it said its ex partner “failed to satisfy a number of important conditions in the contract.”","Boeing has not publicly disclosed what those conditions were, but sources told Reuters over the weekend that the U.S. planemaker raised objections about funding and legal matters.",Embraer says it did indeed meet all conditions and has taken Boeing to arbitration.,"Either way, the contract says Boeing could have waived any unmet conditions on the part of Embraer, but the U.S. planemaker decided not to do so and canceled the deal instead.",Both Embraer and Boeing declined to comment on the contract.,"“Boeing couldn’t afford this deal and they found a way to get out of their obligations,” said Scott Hamilton, a longtime aviation consultant at Leeham Company. “They just had to find a way to axe the deal and retain those $4 billion.”","Under the contract signed in January 2019, Boeing would have taken over Embraer’s commercial aviation unit, paying $4.21 billion for an 80% stake. At the time, demand for jets was soaring with no end in sight and Embraer was feeling the pinch of fighting against titans Boeing and Airbus as an independent planemaker.","The coronavirus crisis worsened in March and Boeing started openly discussing some form of U.S. government assistance, as it was also getting nearer to closing the Embraer deal. Several countries had granted antitrust approvals and Embraer had finished carving out its commercial aviation unit as well as built new headquarters for after Boeing’s takeover.","Besides “epidemics or pandemics,” and changes in the world’s economy, wars and natural disasters were also barred as reasons to cancel the deal.","Embraer’s market value fell by over two-thirds to $1 billion during the crisis, leading analysts to begin worrying that the deal would fall apart or at least be renegotiated.","“On an ordinary basis, Boeing would have repriced the deal,” Hamilton said.",But the contract banned Boeing from walking away due to “any change in the market price” of Embraer shares. Other conditions that would not allow Boeing to walk away included if Embraer’s credit ratings were downgraded or if it failed to meet its own revenue or earnings forecasts.,It is unclear who requested that the contract be this restrictive.

My favorite airplane is the right plane for the mission,” he added.","Though the Boeing-Embraer deal would cut the number of plane suppliers, airlines say the unique barriers to entry and winner-takes-all mentality of aviation mean playing off the two ultra-competitive industry giants in negotiations can lower prices to levels that standalone smaller competitors cannot match.","“I prefer to have two players really competing than two and a half players failing to do so,” said Antonoaldo Neves, chief executive of airline TAP Portugal.","Price is not the only factor.

Embraer executives said the delivery should spur more orders, helping to fend off fresh competition from Airbus.","“I expect we will close more transactions, I’m hopeful ... before the end of the year,” John Slattery, head of Embraer’s commercial plane division, told Reuters. “I’m not seeing a big wave of people that need to delay, or wish to delay because of the Boeing transaction.”","The new plane comes as the landscape for jets with under 150 seats is changing drastically. Airbus bought control of the Bombardier BBDb.TO division competing directly with Embraer in 2018, followed by Boeing's deal to take over Embraer's commercial plane division.","The result would expand the global duopoly for jumbo jets into a smaller category, as Boeing and Airbus work to lure orders across a broader lineup of commercial aircraft.","Azul was founded by U.S. airline executive David Neeleman, who also founded JetBlue Airways JBLU.O, which was a launch customer and key customer for Embraer's last generation of jets.","“We can have 18 more seats with this plane, with a travel cost that is 15% less,” Neeleman said of the improvements in the new generation. “If you have something that is 15% cheaper, you just want that thing, you don’t want anything else.”","Embraer is banking on the fuel efficiency of this new generation, to the point it has marketed its E195-E2 to customers as the “profit hunter,” painting the jet with livery resembling a shark in the plane’s nose.","But for now, Embraer has struggled to compete directly with Airbus. Carriers and plane lessors had placed 551 orders for the Airbus A220 family as of June, but Embraer had racked up only 168 for its new family of E2 jets, down from 200 in 2014.","Part of Embraer's struggles stem from its smaller E175-E2 plane, which has been a hard sell to U.S. regional airlines due to labor contract restrictions. Embraer dropped 100 of those planes from its order book after resistance from pilots made it unclear if buyer Skywest SKYW.O would be able to fly them.","“We didn’t design an aircraft just for the U.S. market,” Slattery said, adding that he hopes his company will secure an order from a customer somewhere else in the world this year. Currently they have none, although Slattery said Skywest remains committed, if pilots allow it.","JetBlue also dealt a blow to Embraer last year when it decided to replace its old Embraer fleet with Airbus A220s, a decade after Neeleman left the company.","JetBlue cited the advantages of A220’s longer range, as well as a broader package with Airbus including larger planes — the kind of arrangement that Boeing could offer with Embraer’s jets in its portfolio."

JetBlue canceled an order of 24 planes after announcing in July that it would use Airbus jets to replace its aging Embraer fleet.,Embraer also said it had dropped a 100-plane order from Skywest Inc from the backlog due to uncertainty about whether pilots will agree to fly its E175-E2 for U.S. regional carriers.,Sales of Embraer’s commercial jet have faced headwinds this year as it transitions to a new line-up and starts competing with Airbus SE.,Embraer is in the process of selling 80 percent of its commercial jet division to Boeing Co.

Presidential candidates vying to take office in January have come out for and against the deal.",Left-wing politicians and Brazilian labor prosecutors have also launched legal challenges to the deal.,"Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) fell by 83 percent to $44 million, missing an average forecast of $142.5 million."

It’s a clean-sheet design, it’s not a re-engine of an existing platform,” he said, adding its benefit lay in low operating costs and fuel savings.","The E190-E2, which Embraer is showing at Farnborough with a shark painted on its nose, is the first of three new-generation aircraft in Embraer's commercial jet line-up with new wings and new Pratt & Whitney UTX.N engines aimed at improving fuel efficiency.","“The combination of knowledge gained from the first generation and the new technology is what makes us unique,” Rodrigo Silva e Souza, vice president marketing, Embraer Commercial Aviation, said, highlighting fuel burn and longer maintenance intervals as the main savings for operators.","The smallest version of the E2, the E175-E2 has been slowed due to a scope clause in U.S. pilots’ contracts that bars it from the U.S. regional aviation market due to its weight.","Slattery said Embraer was still planning entry into service towards the end of 2021, adding he saw opportunities outside of North America, such as replacing turboprops being flown in south-east Asia and CIS countries.","Bombardier’s Cromer said he didn’t expect the scope clause to be changed any time soon, adding that benefited its CRJ airplane.","Meanwhile, U.S. carriers are still interested in the current version of the E175, Slattery said, adding that jet would continue to be produced as long as it’s required."

They have started to organize in big blocs, making it harder for companies of Embraer’s size to negotiate,” he said.",Embraer shares fell 10 percent in New York and nearly 15 percent in Sao Paulo on disappointment at the financial terms of the long-awaited deal.,"The price tag for Embraer’s commercial aviation unit was “significantly lower” than early reports, according to analysts at Vertical Research Partners, who underscored in a client note that a deal must still clear political and regulatory barriers before closing as proposed at the end of next year.","“We also see strong odds of Embraer shareholders demanding a higher price for the stake in the commercial segment,” wrote BTG Pactual analysts Renato Mimica and Samuel Alves in a note.","The partnership, which adds a 70- to 130-seat family to Boeing’s lineup, is expected to boost the U.S. firm’s earnings per share from 2020, generating annual pre-tax cost savings of about $150 million by the third year, the companies said.",Boeing shares were little changed on Thursday.,"Embraer will transfer much of its debt to the new venture and receive cash from Boeing, Embraer executives told analysts.","About a fifth of the cash payment will go to taxes and the rest could be split between share buybacks, a special dividend, deleveraging and new product development, they said.","Silva told employees in his note that Embraer would improve its cash position by $1 billion once the deal closes, allowing more investment in new projects.","Embraer will hold the remaining 20 percent of the Boeing joint venture and keep control of its defense and business jet operations. Concern over U.S. influence in military programs had raised flags in the Brazilian government, which holds a strategic veto at Embraer dating back to its privatization.","However, recent signals from Brazil’s President Michel Temer and military officials suggest the government is satisfied with the new structure of the tie-up, as long as Brazilian jobs are maintained and Embraer continues to develop new technology.",One government official said the deal as announced on Thursday was likely to get approval in Brasilia.

The division has combined orders in hand for just for over 100 planes.","Cromer said the CRJ’s new Atmosphere interior, which increases bin space for carry-on luggage and other upgrades, makes the plane more competitive against the E175 which some airlines preferred for its cabin.","“I think there was a perception, depending on which version of the CRJ that the airline was operating, that the Embraer was new and an upgraded cabin versus the CRJ experience and I think we responded to that very effectively with the Atmosphere cabin,” he said.",“There’s no reason why we shouldn’t be saying we can attack half the market.”,"Bombardier, which launched its CRJ program in the early 1990s and has around 2,000 regional jets in the air, has a 30 percent market share in the U.S. over the last two years, a company spokeswoman said.","But Bombardier’s market share in the global 60-to-100 seat market has grown over the last two years to 42 percent, helped by the launch of the Atmosphere cabin, and 90-seat Q400 turboprop, which has lower operating costs, Nathalie Siphengphet said.",Bombardier has disclosed 35 firm orders for the CRJ 900 Atmosphere.
