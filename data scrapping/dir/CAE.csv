Southwest Airlines Co LUV.N and Air Canada AC.TO have removed the plane from their schedules until January 2020, but there is no firm date for MAX to resume flights.","“Clearly there is going to be a lot of training to be done when the aircraft are cleared so I would see pent up demand there when the airlines start to fly,” Parent said.","CAE recorded 47 sales of 737 MAX simulators, with 11 delivered and another 11 to be delivered by December.","MAX simulator sales are driven by plane orders, Parent said, adding that demand was not unusual.","CAE said costs rose with the company’s selling, general and administrative expenses up 10% and finance expenses doubling.","CAE reported a weaker-than-expected negative free cash flow of C$102.1 million, compared with an estimated negative cash flow of C$11 million, according to four analysts polled by Refinitiv.","But Chief Financial Officer Sonya Branco said free cash flow was impacted by simulator deliveries, which are under production for delivery later in the year. CAE delivered five simulators during the quarter compared with 12 during the same period last year.","“We expect those to be delivered over the next three quarters, so really, it’s just a question of timing,” she said.","CAE’s revenue rose 14% to C$825.6 million, but fell short of analysts’ expectations of C$845.96 million.","Net income attributable to shareholders fell 11.4% to C$61.5 million ($46.26 million), or 23 Canadian cents per share, in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 ended June 30.",Analysts on an average had expected 28 Canadian cents per share.,The company raised its quarterly dividend by 10% to 11 Canadian cents per share.
