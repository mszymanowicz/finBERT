These days banks are safer, and the United States is on the cusp of a post-pandemic recovery rather than a post-crisis slump. What remains the same is that such windfalls tend to be fleeting.","Goldman’s first-quarter blowout was even bigger than expected. Its global markets business, which includes trading securities, generated revenue of $7.6 billion, over 50% higher than forecast by analysts polled by Refinitiv. Income from underwriting equities was a record $1.6 billion. It was a similar story at JPMorgan (JPM.N), where income from stock and bond issuance rose 64% and trading income swelled 25%.","Goldman’s annualized return on equity of 31% is all the more remarkable because the denominator is so much bigger. Back in 2009, Goldman had around $64 billion of equity, versus $88 billion now. Regulators have made sure banks are better padded and more able to cope with risks like the collapse of hedge fund Archegos Capital Management, which Goldman appears to have escaped without a scratch.","Outsize gains are likely to be as transitory as they were in 2009, though. Executives aren’t pretending otherwise. Goldman Chairman and Chief Executive David Solomon has been trying to beef up more stable activities like deposit-taking and lending. The more volatile parts of Goldman’s business – trading and investments on its own balance sheet – brought in 55% of revenue in the first quarter, the highest share in eight years.","The catch is that more prosaic business lines are muted right now. JPMorgan made as much revenue from trading and underwriting as from its colossal consumer bank. Total loans at the firm run by Jamie Dimon fell by 4% year-on-year. Lending at Wells Fargo (WFC.N), which also reported first-quarter results on Wednesday, dropped 15%.","That explains why investors aren’t too excited. Back at the end of 2009, Goldman Sachs traded at around 1.3 times its estimated book value for the next 12 months, roughly the same as now. JPMorgan’s multiple has doubled over the same period. Trading booms are great while they last, but experience has taught that they generally don’t.",On Twitter https://twitter.com/johnsfoley,,CONTEXT NEWS,"- Goldman Sachs on April 14 reported a 31% annualized return on equity for the first quarter of 2021, as its trading and underwriting businesses boosted earnings to $6.7 billion from $1.1 billion in the same period a year earlier.","- The Wall Street firm made $5.9 billion from market-making, a 60% increase on the same period in 2020, driven by a 68% increase in equities trading.","- JPMorgan’s earnings rose to $13.9 billion in the first quarter, up 470% year-on-year, similarly buoyed by strong markets-related results, including a 47% increase in equities trading.","- Chief Executive Jamie Dimon described JPMorgan’s lending business as “challenged” because of low demand for loans.

Businesses often seek to limit the ability of plaintiffs to pursue class actions in order to avoid the higher damages often seen in such litigation.,"“How are you defining generic or, stated otherwise, what kinds of statements are not generic?” Justice Brett Kavanaugh asked an attorney for Goldman.",Some justices wondered how courts would analyze a class action against a company that simply called itself “nice.”,"“There are people who would regard, ‘We are a nice company,’ as a fraudulent statement depending upon subsequent events, and how would they make that case?” Chief Justice John Roberts asked.","The case stemmed from Goldman’s sale of collateralized debt obligations including Abacus 2007 AC-1, which it assembled with help from hedge fund manager John Paulson.","In 2010, Goldman reached a $550 million settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to resolve charges that it cheated Abacus investors by concealing Paulson’s role, including how he made a $1 billion profit by betting the sale of collateralized debt obligations would fail.","The plaintiffs said that the share price would have been lower if the truth had been known about the company’s conflicts of interest, adding that they lost more than $13 billion due to Goldman’s conduct.",The Manhattan-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year upheld a federal judge’s decision to let the plaintiffs sue as a group and rejected the company’s argument that generic statements can never impact a stock price.,A ruling is due by the end of June.

Erica P. John Fund.","But it’s clear that plaintiffs' firms in the shareholder class action bar are taking the case seriously. Amicus briefs backing the Arkansas pension fund suing Goldman rolled into the Supreme Court on Wednesday. Shareholder firms turned out in force: Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann for the National Association of Shareholder and Consumer Attorneys. Grant & Eisenhofer for financial economists. Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein for former commissioners and officials of the Securities and Exchange Commission, including two former SEC chairs. Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check for a big group of institutional investors. Cohen Milstein Sellers & Toll for the North American Securities Administrators Association.","Pomerantz, Berger & Montague, Kirby McInerney and Bleichmar Fonti & Auld also signed briefs supporting the Arkansas fund, which is represented in the Goldman class action by Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd and Labaton Sucharow.","These firms gleefully stomp all over each other in lead counsel fights – but those rivalries get put aside when Goldman and the business lobby attempt to curtail securities class actions. It’s kind of like when a grade school bully goes after your sister. No matter how viciously the two of you fight at home, you step up to defend family against outside attacks.","Not all of the briefs include shareholder class action firms. Public Citizen lawyers, for instance, argued that adopting Goldman’s position would add unnecessary cost to securities litigation. The attorneys general of 16 states urged the Supreme Court to remember that shareholder class actions serve the crucial purpose of “remedying actual losses suffered by investors as a result of securities fraud.” I should also point out that shareholder class actions firms were not counsel of record in most of the Supreme Court amicus briefs they signed, deferring to appellate specialists including Deepak Gupta of Gupta Wessler, Daniel Geyser of Alexander Dubose Jefferson, J. Carl Cecere and J.P. Schnapper-Casteras.","The amicus briefs, overall, added to the thrust of the Arkansas fund’s argument in its merits brief that lower courts should rely on empirical evidence, rather than “common sense” or intuition, to decide the price impact of a defendant’s alleged misrepresentations.",I emailed Goldman’s lawyers and counsel to the Arkansas fund for comment on the new round of amicus briefs. Neither side provided a statement in response.,"In the underlying case, you probably recall, plaintiffs claimed that Goldman deceived investors when it said in public filings that it placed customer interests ahead of its own and took care to avoid conflicts. Those statements of business principle, shareholders alleged, were proved false in the financial crisis, when Goldman was revealed to have marketed certain complex financial products to clients without revealing its own bets (or the bets of other clients) against the products.",Goldman has insisted throughout the 10-year history of the case that the alleged misrepresentations were so generic that they could not have mattered to investors. The bank said its share price fell because of news it was under government investigation – not because shareholders suddenly lost faith in its anodyne statements of business principle.,"The Supreme Court ruled in the 2014 Halliburton case, as you know, that securities class action defendants can defeat class certification if they can show their alleged misstatements had no price impact. So the key question in the Goldman case is what evidence judges can consider. To simplify ruthlessly, Goldman’s lawyers at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison and Sullivan & Cromwell urged the Supreme Court in the bank’s merits brief to clarify that judges can consider the nature of the alleged misrepresentations in deciding whether the statements had an impact on the share price.","The U.S. Justice Department, in an amicus brief  filed last month, agreed that the nature of the statements may be relevant to courts weighing price impact. But the Arkansas fund’s Supreme Court counsel from Goldstein & Russell argued in its merits brief that under Supreme Court precedent, class certification is not the time for courts to consider whether alleged misstatements were material. Judges, the fund said, should rely on expert evidence to decide the price impact of the defendant’s statements, leaving aside their subjective view of whether the statements might have swayed investors.",The financial economists who filed an amicus brief on Wednesday assured the justices that they have the analytic tools to analyze price impact empirically. A distinguished cadre of securities law professors told the Supreme Court that adopting Goldman’s position would allow defendants to skirt the justices’ own holding in 2013’s Amgen v. Connecticut Retirement Plans and Trust Funds that securities plaintiffs don’t have to prove materiality to be certified as a class.,"One final note on Wednesday’s amicus filings: Most of the filings were dedicated to refuting Goldman’s arguments about the price impact of allegedly generic misstatements, but a group of law professors who specialize in evidentiary law confronted Goldman’s secondary argument that defendants should bear only the burden of production to show their misstatements had no price impact. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals held in the Goldman case that the bank had to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the generic statements didn’t affect its share price. Goldman contends plaintiffs should have born the burden under Rule 301 of the Federal Rules of Evidence. Twenty-seven law professors said Wednesday that Goldman is wrong.",The Goldman case is set for oral argument on March 29.,"Opinions expressed here are those of the author.

The same is not always true of bankers. Goldman Sachs has lost Omer Ismail, the head of its consumer business, just two months after naming him to that job and almost 20 years after he joined the firm. Ismail is going to Walmart, the $368 billion U.S. grocery chain that’s just about the opposite of Goldman in terms of brand positioning.","As with any high-level departure, the reasons are likely to include a pull and a push. Walmart has been tinkering with the idea of financial services for years. And the thinking that inspired the launch of Goldman’s retail bank back in 2016 – with Ismail as a founding member – applies to the grocer too. Goldman saw that customers were frustrated by their banking experiences and decided it had expertise, and a banking license, that could help.","Walmart doesn’t have a license, for now. But with millions of consumers visiting its 5,000-plus U.S. stores multiple times a month, the company could become a force to be reckoned with in payments, deposit services or even to buy-now-pay-later credit of the kind offered by startups like Affirm. Given Walmart’s sheer scale, and pre-tax profit almost double Goldman’s, boss Doug McMillon can afford to pay enough to make the opportunity interesting. Ismail is taking senior colleague David Stark with him. Greg Berry, the Goldman division’s systems architect, left the bank last year, according to his LinkedIn page.","And the push? Goldman’s retail business, branded Marcus, was once the company’s most exciting growth opportunity. But the prospect of rock-bottom interest rates and uncertain consumer credit has taken away some of the shine. Last year, none of the firm’s new partners came from the consumer division. The relaxed vibe at Marcus, epitomized by Berry’s nose ring, may be less of a fit than Goldman thought.","That leaves Goldman’s retail bank as a nice if small addition to its business. In good years, the returns on equity from credit-card lending and consumer banking are among the highest in finance. It makes $1 billion of annual revenue. But it’s not likely to disrupt the financial services industry. Walmart, if it ramps up its finance activities, is an altogether different beast – unhappily for Wall Street firms hoping to hang on to their top fintech talent."

Back in 1987, when the U.S. Supreme Court was contemplating the fraud-on-the-market principle that is the framework for securities fraud class actions, the Justice Department, on behalf of the Securities and Exchange Commission, filed an amicus brief in Basic v. Levinson, advising the justices to adopt the presumption that in an efficient market, shareholders rely on a defendant’s misrepresentations.","A quarter-century later, when the Supreme Court revisited the Basic presumption in 2014’s Halliburton v. Erica P. John Fund, DOJ and the SEC reminded that justices that the government relies on investor class actions to help police the market. DOJ filed its Halliburton amicus brief in support of shareholders, arguing that the Supreme Court should leave intact the Basic fraud-on-the-market presumption.",Want more On the Case? Listen to the On the Case podcast.,"The Justice Department and the SEC weighed in Monday in Goldman Sachs v. Arkansas Teacher Retirement System, the Supreme Court case that Goldman Sachs has billed as the most important shareholder class action to come before the justices since Halliburton. I’ll admit: The government’s brief surprised me. DOJ and the SEC are backing shareholders on some key points, as I’ll explain. But the government is also urging the Supreme Court to vacate the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision certifying investors as a class, arguing that the justices should instruct lower courts to consider the nature of a defendant’s alleged misrepresentations at the class certification stage of shareholder class actions.",The government said the 2nd Circuit may have viewed the bank’s evidence too narrowly – and it wants the Supreme Court to adopt Goldman’s position that defendants should be permitted to rebut the presumption of reliance by arguing generic statements didn’t impact share price.,"In case you’re wondering, the brief was signed by the Biden administration’s acting Solicitor General, Elizabeth Prelogar, as well as career lawyers from the SEC and Justice Department. (One of the signers is deputy solicitor general Malcolm Stewart, who argued for the government when the Supreme Court heard the Halliburton case.)","As you probably know if you’ve been reading my many, many stories about the Goldman securities case, the bank’s shareholders allege that Goldman lied when it said in public statements before the mortgage crisis that it put customers’ interests before those of the bank and that it strived to avoid conflicts. Those statements, according to shareholders, were proven false by revelations that Goldman sold doomed-to-fail collateralized debt securities, including the notorious Abacus CDO that led to a $550 million settlement between the bank and the SEC. Shareholders claim Goldman shares' value plunged – by as much as $13 billion – when investors realized the falsity of the bank’s assurances of principled business practices.","Goldman, which denied deceiving investors, argued during class certification proceedings that its allegedly fraudulent statements of business principles had no impact on the company’s share price. The Supreme Court’s 2014 ruling in the Halliburton case permits defendants to defeat class certification by breaking the link between alleged misrepresentations and a drop in the defendant’s stock. Goldman offered expert evidence that it was news of a government investigation of the bank’s CDOs – and not investors’ loss of faith in the bank’s generic statements about avoiding conflicts – that erased billions from its market capitalization. Anodyne statements of principle, the bank argued, simply can’t be the basis of a shareholder class action because no reasonable investor places any value on them.","The majority in a divided 2nd Circuit opinion rejected Goldman’s argument, reminding the bank that in 2013’s Amgen v. Connecticut Retirement Systems, the Supreme Court said investors don’t have to prove the materiality of a defendant's misrepresentations in order to be certified as a class. Goldman, the 2nd Circuit majority said, was trying to “smuggle” materiality into the class certification stage of the litigation by arguing that generic statements can’t underlie shareholder class actions.","In DOJ’s new Supreme Court brief, the government told the justices that it believes Goldman overreached in the lower courts when it argued that generic statements should be considered immaterial as a matter of law. The 2nd Circuit correctly rejected that argument, the DOJ brief said.",The government also agreed that the 2nd Circuit applied the correct standard of proof in evaluating Goldman Sachs’ evidence rebutting the price impact of its alleged misstatements. The bank has asked the Supreme Court to hold that defendants must only show by a preponderance of evidence that their misstatements didn’t affect the company’s share price. The 2nd Circuit said defendants bear a burden of persuasion to rebut the presumption that shareholders relied on fraudulent statements. The government’s amicus brief urged the justices to confirm that more stringent standard.,"But DOJ agreed with Goldman’s lawyers at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison and Sullivan & Cromwell that, despite Amgen, lower courts can consider the nature of a defendant’s alleged falsehoods when they’re deciding whether to certify a shareholder class. That inquiry, the brief said, might overlap with the court’s consideration of the materiality of the statements, which is not a matter to be determined in class certification litigation. But the overlap, DOJ said, doesn’t mean courts should ignore the nature of the alleged misrepresentations in weighing their impact on share price.","“Especially if the other evidence about price impact (is) conflicting or ambiguous, evidence about the nature of the misstatement — i.e., evidence about whether the misstatement involved the sort of information that was inherently likely to affect the market price — might reasonably influence the court’s determination whether the defendant had disproved price impact by a preponderance of the evidence,” the DOJ brief said.","It’s not clear, the government said, whether the 2nd Circuit majority took into account that Goldman is accused of deceiving investors in generic, anodyne statements of business principles. To the extent that the majority meant to suggest that any consideration of the generic quality of the statements was impermissible under Amgen, DOJ said, the 2nd Circuit was wrong.","The Supreme Court, DOJ said, should vacate the 2nd Circuit ruling and instruct lower courts that they may consider the nature of the alleged misstatements as relevant evidence reviewing defendants’ rebuttal evidence.","I’m sure shareholders’ Supreme Court counsel from Goldstein & Russell will argue in their merits brief that the DOJ brief underscores that plaintiffs have already won the battle against any Supreme Court ruling that generic corporate statements cannot, as a matter of law, be the basis of a shareholder class action. And, as I mentioned, DOJ is also siding with plaintiffs on defendants’ burden.",But shareholders’ lead counsel from Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd were gearing up for a potential trial against Goldman Sachs before this 11-year-old case went to the Supreme Court. And now the government is calling for the justices to send it back to the 2nd Circuit for another look at class certification. That can’t be good news.,(This story has been corrected. A previous version incorrectly reported that the Justice Department agreed with Goldman Sachs that the 2nd Circuit viewed the bank’s evidence too narrowly.)

Erica P. John Fund has been, well, a flop.","But the bank told the justices they can change that! What the Supreme Court needs to do, Goldman’s lawyers at Paul, Weiss, Rifkin, Wharton & Garrison argued in the bank’s opening brief in Goldman Sachs v. Arkansas Teacher Retirement System, is remind lower courts just how much leeway defendants are supposed to have in opposing shareholder fraud class actions.","In the 2014 decision, as you surely remember, the Supreme Court left intact the structural premise of securities class actions, in which shareholders are entitled to a presumption of reliance on defendants’ alleged misrepresentations as long as they can show the company’s shares traded in an efficient market. (That premise, in turn, is based on the idea that in an efficient market, the share price reflects all public information.)","But the Halliburton decision emphasized that defendants can rebut that presumption of reliance -- and thus prevent shareholders from being certified as a class. The Supreme Court said in Halliburton that securities class action defendants are entitled to offer evidence that their alleged misrepresentations did not actually affect the price of their companies’ shares. If defendants can break the chain between its share price and the alleged fraud, the court said in Halliburton, then shareholders can’t litigate as a class.","Since that 2014 decision, Goldman said in Monday’s brief, Halliburton has benefited defendants in a grand total of five cases, one at the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals (IBEW Local 98 Pension Fund v. Best Buy Co, 818 F.3d 775) and four in trial courts. By Goldman Sachs’ reckoning, no securities class action defendant has managed to rebut the presumption of reliance since 2018. And they’ve had plenty of chances: Shareholders have filed more than 2,000 securities class actions since the Supreme Court’s Halliburton ruling.","The record in cases positing a so-called price maintenance theory is even worse for defendants, Goldman said. These cases, as I’ve explained, are a twist on classic shareholder class actions in which plaintiffs allege that a company’s share price rose in response to a fraudulent statement and then fell when the truth was disclosed. In price maintenance cases, shareholders allege that a company’s misrepresentations allowed its share price to remain at an unwarranted height. The extent of the fraud, according to price maintenance theory, is revealed by the drop in the company’s share price when the truth emerges.","This theory – which underlies the Goldman class action, as I’ll explain – has become increasingly prevalent in shareholder fraud class actions in the last several years, with endorsements by the 2nd, 7th and 11th Circuits. A 2019 Harvard Law Review study found that 60% of a sample of shareholder class action filings between 2014 and 2017 were based on price maintenance. And Halliburton has proved to be singularly ineffective in defeating class certification in these cases. According to Goldman’s brief, defendants in price maintenance cases have never successfully invoked Halliburton to defeat class certification.","The problem, according to Goldman, is that lower courts have failed to strike the proper balance between Halliburton and previous Supreme Court decisions. In 2013’s Amgen v. Connecticut Retirement Plans, the court held that shareholders are not required to prove the materiality of a defendant’s alleged misrepresentations in order to be certified as a class. And in a precursor to the 2014 Halliburton decision, the justices said in a 2011 decision known as Halliburton I that shareholders don’t have to prove price impact at the class certification stage.","Goldman argued that its case exemplifies the imbalance. Goldman shareholders allege that the company’s share price was artificially inflated by statements about its business principles, such as avoiding conflicts of interest and putting customers first. Shareholders posited that when Goldman fell under government investigation for an alleged conflict of interest in the structuring of four collateralized debt offerings, including the Abacus CDO that led the bank to a $550 million settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the market realized the falsity of the bank’s statements of business principle. They attributed declines in Goldman’s share price to the allegedly fraudulent statements of business principles.","Goldman contends – and has expert testimony to back the contention – that declines in its share price were unrelated to those statements. The bank’s experts offered evidence that the market did not react to dozens of news reports on Abacus and other CDOs but was spooked when the government began investigating. The share price drop, according to the bank, wasn’t because investors realized Goldman’s generic statements were false. Those statements, it argued, were not material to investors and had no impact on the price of its shares.","When the 2nd Circuit upheld certification of the shareholder class in Goldman’s case, the majority said the bank’s emphasis on the generic, anodyne nature of the alleged misstatements was an attempt to “smuggle” materiality into litigation over class certification.","That approach, Goldman told the Supreme Court, undermines the intent of the justices’ 2014 Halliburton decision, making it virtually impossible for defendants to rebut the presumption that investors relied on alleged misstatements. The bank called on the Supreme Court to make it clear to the lower courts that they must take defendants’ evidence on materiality and price impact into account during class certification litigation. Amgen and Halliburton I hold that investors are not required to prove those elements at the class certification stage, but, Goldman argued, those rulings do not preclude trial and appellate courts from looking at defendants’ evidence rebutting the presumption of reliance. Defendants’ price impact evidence at the class certification stage, Goldman said, may overlap with evidence on the merits of shareholders’ claims.","It’s time, the bank said, for the Supreme Court to clarify that “a court may not refuse to consider evidence relevant to price impact merely because it is also relevant to materiality and loss causation.”","I asked the Arkansas pension fund’s Supreme Court counsel, Thomas Goldstein of Goldstein & Russell, for comment on Goldman’s brief but didn’t hear back."

The bank’s 2020 performance was buffeted wildly by a combination of good times for traders, terrible times for almost everyone else, and a legacy of bad behavior in Goldman’s own ranks. Remove the noise and Goldman still hit a sweet spot.","Goldman’s earnings grew 13% to $8.9 billion in a year in which most rivals saw double-digit declines. Bank of America on Tuesday reported a 37% drop, following Citigroup, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo southward. The difference is trading income, which accounts for almost half of Goldman’s revenue, and which surged. That more than outweighed the fines the bank paid to settle its role in Malaysia’s 1MDB scandal, an atonement that knocked around $3.4 billion off its net profit.","Look past the 1MDB fine, and Goldman would have made a return on equity of 15%, its best since 2009. That’s not all Solomon’s doing. Deduct the $3 billion increase in markets-related earnings – a Covid-19 windfall – and that figure falls by about 3.8 percentage points. But it’s still higher than the 10% the firm produced in 2019, and above Goldman’s likely cost of equity.","It’s undoubtedly progress. Under the surface, the $100 billion bank is becoming more efficient: It is already half way to its $1.3 billion medium-term cost-cutting target. Furthermore, Goldman’s giant operations are gradually getting cheaper to fund, thanks to its efforts at gathering retail deposits. Those increased by a third. Again, Covid-19 swelled deposits at all big lenders. Even Wells Fargo, which is in the doghouse for years of scamming its customers, grew its retail balances by 21%.","Solomon may have picked an unfortunate moment to set big targets, but his timing when it comes to retail banking is nifty. Goldman benefits from the surge in deposits but isn’t being dragged down by the slump in lending and the sliding rates that have impacted other big lenders.

One of the sources said the bank had M&A bankers crunching numbers on “different ideas.”","Digital banking is one area of interest. The pandemic has strengthened management’s belief that online activity will be central to future growth within the industry and branches will continue to have a diminished role, the source said.","As a result, executives are ruling out any deals that involve acquiring branches. Digital businesses that bring in new customers or unique technologies would be attractive to the bank, the source said.",Goldman Sachs declined to comment.,"Building out Marcus, which is named after one of the bank’s founders, is a key plank of Chief Executive David Solomon’s plan to reduce Goldman’s reliance on volatile trading and investment banking revenues. To do so, Solomon wants to build businesses with predictable revenues such as consumer banking and mass-market wealth management, which most of its main rivals now have.","In January last year, Solomon set out three- and five-year financial goals for Marcus as well as the overall profitability of the firm. The three sources said booming investment banking and trading businesses during the pandemic and cost cuts made possible by remote working have helped Goldman make significant progress on its profitability and cost-cutting goals.","However, worried about the quality of loans in the middle of a recession, executives have said they slowed loan and deposit growth at Marcus.","When Goldman reports its fourth quarter results Tuesday, it is expected to say that loan growth at its consumer business, which includes Marcus and a credit card joint venture with Apple Inc, has been slower than anticipated, the three sources said.","The bank may warn that a target it set to grow consumer loans and credit card balances to over $20 billion over five years, from $7 billion in January 2020, could take longer to achieve if the economic slowdown persists, the sources said.","It is expected to stick with a target to achieve $125 billion of deposits over the same period, anticipating that market conditions will improve, the sources said. Total deposits were $96 billion at the end of third quarter.","Goldman plans to keep the deposit target despite regulatory restrictions in the United Kingdom and its decision to cut rates on U.S. savings accounts slowed growth dramatically in the second half of 2020, the sources said. The bank added just $4 billion of deposits in the third quarter after adding $32 billion during the first half.",Rival Morgan Stanley spent more than $20 billion last year acquiring discount brokerage E*Trade and investment management firm Eaton Vance.,"Analysts and industry insiders have long expected Goldman to try to grow its consumer business through acquisitions, and some said the time was right for the bank to do so now.","Last year, the bank settled long-pending corruption probes involving Malaysia’s sovereign wealth fund 1MDB, lifting a cloud that can often keep regulators from signing off on major acquisitions.","At the same time, regulatory sources said President-elect Joe Biden’s administration may take a more restrictive stance on allowing bank deals than the Trump administration did, meaning there might be a limited window to do large banking deals.","Moreover, the bank has excess capital following U.S. Federal Reserve’s decision last year to restrict payouts."

Erica P. John Fund. The justices will review a split 2020 decision by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which upheld the certification of a class of Goldman Sachs shareholders to proceed with claims that the bank lied to shareholders when it touted its business principles and procedures for averting conflicts with investors.","Goldman’s counsel at Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison pitched the case to the Supreme Court as an opportunity to correct a misreading of its Halliburton precedent before plaintiffs lawyers run wild with a theory of shareholder class actions that the Supreme Court has never even recognized. In Halliburton, Goldman argued, the Supreme Court held that defendants can defeat class certification by showing that their alleged misrepresentations did not impact their share price. According to Goldman, there’s no way that investors relied on its anodyne statements of business principles. By refusing to consider the nature of the alleged misrepresentations in the Goldman case, the 2nd Circuit majority defied Halliburton and gave shareholder lawyers a glide path to class certification, Goldman argued.",Want more On the Case? Listen to the On the Case podcast.,"Shareholders’ counsel from Goldstein & Russell retorted in a brief opposing Supreme Court review that the 2nd Circuit was following the Supreme Court’s own precedent in 2013’s Amgen v. Connecticut Retirement Plans. “In Amgen, this court could not have been clearer that plaintiffs are ‘not required to prove the materiality of (a defendant's) alleged misrepresentations and omissions at the class-certification stage,’” the opposition brief said, quoting the Supreme Court’s Amgen ruling. Shareholders downplayed the significance of the question Goldman presented, arguing that defendants in securities class actions can contest the materiality of alleged misstatements when they first move for shareholder cases to be dismissed. And if the statements are truly immaterial, shareholders said, then defendants ought to be able to muster evidence that the revelation of their falsity did not impact share price.","At least four justices agreed with Goldman that the Supreme Court has to look again at the interplay between its Halliburton and Amgen precedent – which, as the 7th Circuit held in July in In re: Allstate Securities Litigation requires trial judges to “split some very fine hairs.” (Notably, Justice Amy Coney Barrett was on the 7th Circuit’s Allstate panel before she was elevated to the Supreme Court, although she did not write the opinion.) The Allstate decision -- which Goldman and shareholders both cited throughout their briefs – was refreshingly frank about how hard it has been for lower courts to reconcile Amgen’s prohibition on considering the materiality of alleged misstatements with Halliburton’s leeway for defendants to contest the price impact of alleged misrepresentations.","The case, in other words, should bring some clarity to a murky aspect of securities class action litigation. The question is whether that clarity will help shareholders or defendants.","The Goldman case, as you probably recall, stems from the bank’s sale of complex collateralized debt obligations it assembled with the assistance of the hedge fund Paulson & Co. Goldman did not disclose to investors that Paulson was involved in structuring the CDOs – not that Paulson had essentially bet on the CDOs to fail. Goldman ended up reaching a $550 million settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission in 2010 over the CDOs, which included the infamous Abacus security. The bank’s shareholders, led by the Arkansas Teachers Retirement System, alleged that revelations about the CDOs exposed the falsity of Goldman Sachs’ statements about avoiding conflicts of interest and putting its clients’ interests first. Goldman’s exposure in the shareholder class action, according to the bank’s filings at the Supreme Court, is as much as $13 billion.","Shareholders’ theory in the Goldman case is a bit of twist on the classic model of securities fraud class actions, in which a defendant’s share price rises in response to a corporate announcement and then falls when the announcement turns out to be false. Goldman’s shareholders instead asserted that the bank’s share price was maintained at an artificially high level because investors trusted Goldman’s long-running assurances about its ethical conduct. When news of Paulson’s influence on the CDOs emerged, shareholders alleged, the fall in Goldman’s share price revealed the impact of the bank’s alleged misrepresentations.","Price-maintenance class actions like the Goldman case are increasingly common. That’s why Goldman contends the stakes are so high at the Supreme Court. According to the bank -- and the business lobby, which has stood by Goldman’s side during two trips to the 2nd Circuit and in certiorari briefing at the Supreme Court – price-maintenance theories allow shareholders to claim fraud without showing that a specific corporate announcement drove the share price up. And, according to Goldman and its amici, by allowing shareholders to proceed as a class based on the alleged falsity of generic statements of business principles, the 2nd Circuit has exposed companies to price-maintenance securities class actions whenever their share price falls in response to negative news.","“This theory,” said Columbia law professor John Coffee in an email to my colleague Nate Raymond, “spares the plaintiffs from having to prove a specific impact on the stock price.” The Supreme Court has never examined a shareholder class action asserting that the defendant’s share price was artificially propped up by misrepresentations, Coffee said, so the justices’ eventual decision could thwart this burgeoning form of securities litigation.","Or not. Shareholders, after all, argued in their brief opposing certiorari that Goldman had plenty of chances to show that the statement at the heart of the case didn’t matter to shareholders. It argued as much in its motion to dismiss the suit, which failed. And it had an opportunity, as required by the Supreme Court’s Halliburton decision, to rebut shareholders’ evidence of price impact in contesting class certification, shareholders said. The bank’s evidence, including expert studies on why its share price dropped after Abacus revelations, simply failed to persuade the 2nd Circuit that its alleged misrepresentations didn’t affect the share price, according to shareholders.","Shareholder counsel Thomas Goldstein told me by email that the Supreme Court, after all, has already heard defendants argue back in the Amgen case that they should be permitted to challenge materiality to defeat class certification. The court rejected those arguments then, Goldstein said, and should do so again in the Goldman case.","“Goldman’s concern that it needs to be able to disprove materiality early in the case is a red herring, because a defendant can make that motion at any time in a motion to dismiss, including pre-certification,” Goldstein said. “Goldman tried that here, and the district court correctly found that its statements were material.” Goldstein also said that it is “bizarre” for the bank to insist that its shareholders “would have disbelieved its own denials that it had massive, undisclosed conflicts of interest in betting against its own customers.”",Goldman Supreme Court counsel Kannon Shanmugam of Paul Weiss and longtime counsel Robert Giuffra of Sullivan & Cromwell declined to comment.

The move also shows the tension between the growing importance of racial justice to investors and the difficulty of effecting social change in the corporate arena.","After pushing companies in its investment portfolio to include at least one woman director since 2019, Goldman Sachs next year wants boards to have a second director from an under-represented background, Catherine Winner, head of stewardship efforts for the $1.8 trillion unit, said in an interview.","For that second spot, Goldman’s definition of diversity includes gender identity, sexual orientation and under-represented race and ethnic groups, and a board with two white women would meet the standard.",Goldman Sachs itself meets the standard based on details in its proxy.,"Winner said the change will lead more companies to meet investor expectations. “Escalation draws attention,” she said on Wednesday.","The asset-management arm can exert leverage at companies where it is an important shareholder. The firm casts proxy votes at more than 9,000 corporate annual meetings a year, and last year 25% of its votes against directors were due to a lack of a woman on the board.","Winner said Goldman stopped short of urging companies to add a racially or ethnically diverse director outright because of challenges around obtaining this information. Many companies do not disclose directors’ racial and ethnic make-up, and investors are wrestling with how to judge companies’ progress on diversity without such data.","Some activists want asset managers to set targets. “You can find the data, the data is out there,” said Roel Campos, a former member of the U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission who is now chair of the Latino Corporate Directors Association.","The relative ease of knowing which candidates are female is one reason women have made faster gains in the boardroom.

In technology investment banking, a unit the bank has heavily invested in, seven new partners were named.","Jane Dunlevie, 35, is among the youngest partners promoted on Thursday, after spending 11 years with the bank.

On balance, the class of 2020 is a solid B-plus – a little more inclusive than the bank’s overall executive ranks, but still representative of an industry that’s mostly white and male. But Goldman’s picks may say something more decisive about its overall financial trajectory.","Only 60 staff made the partnership this year, winning access to a special bonus pool, as well as other perks and ambassadorial duties. That’s down from 69 last time and the smallest number in at least two decades. In terms of diversity, Chief Executive David Solomon has at least moved in the right direction. Just 27% of the elect are women, for example, and 7% identify as Black. That’s less than the general population, but in Goldman’s top tier of employees more broadly, 23% are women and just under 3% Black or African American, according to its most recent sustainability report.","Perhaps as significant is the diversification of what Goldman and its partners actually do. Solomon has talked about deriving more of Goldman’s income from less volatile activities like advising companies, or making interest on loans rather than the choppy business of trading securities. That slipped out of reach this year, as Covid-19 led to dramatic swings in markets and windfalls for trading desks. Those flightier activities made up 47% of Goldman’s revenue in the past four quarters, compared with 41% a year earlier.","On that score, the partnership looks like a better guide to what Solomon has in mind. Around 35% of the new partner class comes from the firm’s global markets division, which includes trading. Two years ago, 41% were in securities. That suggests the trading desk is becoming less of a stairway to heaven. Meanwhile, for all the sound and fury around Solomon’s consumer banking initiative, it generated no new partners – suggesting that division, and its employees, have a little more work to do."

Goldman’s shares were up 1.4% on the news.","“Getting this overhang off the back of management and the company in general is a very big win,” said Marty Mosby, an analyst at boutique brokerage Vining Sparks.","Under terms of the deal, Goldman agreed to pay a $2.3 billion fine for breaking anti-bribery laws and to disgorge $600 million of ill-gotten gains as part of a deferred prosecution agreement, which also requires it to improve its compliance controls.","The bank also agreed for its Malaysia subsidiary to plead guilty in a U.S. federal court on Thursday, in a victory for prosecutors who rarely extract criminal guilty pleas from corporate entities.","Brian Rabbitt, acting head of the Justice Department’s criminal division, said the penalty was the largest ever levied for a breach of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and that the settlement reflected the “seriousness” of the bank’s role “in a massive global scheme to loot billions of dollars” from 1MDB.","The scandal dates to the government of former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, which set up the 1MDB fund in 2009.","Between 2009 and 2014, Goldman bankers paid more than $1.6 billion in bribes to foreign officials in Malaysia and Abu Dhabi to win 1MDB business, including underwriting $6.5 billion in bond sales, for which it earned $600 million in fees.","But billions of the fund’s money were later stolen by high-level fund officials and their associates to pay for real estate, art and other luxury items, with the help of the Goldman bankers, the Justice Department said.","In 2018, the Justice Department filed criminal charges against two of the former Goldman bankers, Tim Leissner and Roger Ng. Leissner pleaded guilty to the charges last year, while Ng’s case is pending in a New York court.","“While many good people worked on these transactions and tried to do the right thing, we recognize that we did not adequately address red flags and scrutinize the representations of certain members of the deal team,” Solomon wrote in a memo to staff on Thursday, adding the bank had already made several compliance improvements.","He said that the bank would be clawing back compensation from the three bankers involved, and its former executive team “in acknowledgement of the Firm’s institutional failures.”","He and other senior executives would also have their compensation for 2020 reduced, bringing the total of clawbacks and pay reductions to $174 million.",Thursday’s deal follows $3.9 billion the bank paid in Malaysia in July to settle charges there related to the matter.,"Since 2019, Goldman had set aside $4.39 billion to cover legal and regulatory matters. Some $2 billion was for matters it already resolved with the Malaysian government. On Thursday, it said it would increase its provisions for litigation and regulatory proceedings for the third quarter by $250 million.",Odeon Capital analyst Dick Bove scolded Goldman’s management teams for allowing the 1MDB bond deals and commended the board for the clawbacks. He said he expects the financial penalties to affect fourth-quarter results despite Goldman’s existing reserves.,"“Every person that participated in the decisions to proceed with these offerings needs their bonuses recaptured by the company. It is very positive to hear that Goldman may actually do this,” he added.","Despite the costs, analysts anticipated that Thursday’s deal should allow Solomon to accelerate his plan to reshape Goldman as a more conventional bank and be less reliant on volatile trading venues. Some investors and analysts viewed the 1MDB probes as an obstacle to Goldman doing transformative deals, since U.S. regulators will often bar banks from making big acquisitions while they’re being probed for serious misconduct.","With clarity over how much the bank needs to pay and a clean slate with regulators, Goldman may be able to be more aggressive on that front, said Mosby.","“When they had this over their heads they didn’t have that opportunity, they had to take a pause. This is a green light to say they can go ahead and do that.”"

There’s a smaller number, though, that’s arguably much more significant. Goldman plans to claw back around $174 million from current and former executives. The catch is that not all the money is still within the firm’s control.","Goldman last year tweaked some awards granted almost a decade ago so it could hold back payments depending on how the Malaysian 1MDB saga panned out. The recipients include Chief Executive David Solomon’s predecessor Lloyd Blankfein. Another who has already cashed out is former Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn. Goldman says it is in talks to recover past payments to a retired executive – that’s Cohn, according to the Wall Street Journal.","Cohn is, in theory, beyond the reach of Goldman’s clawback. He cut direct ties when he left the firm in 2017 to head President Donald Trump’s National Economic Council. As is normal with the revolving door to D.C. – partly for the valid reason that it avoids future conflicts of interest – he was paid out in full. Cohn’s 2011 award was worth $12.9 million according to a 2017 proxy filing, just a small part of an overall cash payout of around $65 million.","All of these numbers are a pittance next to the $5 billion or so that investors have forgone as a result of 1MDB. But there’s a principle at stake, because a shift to the White House or any government position shouldn’t allow a former top executive to escape past sins. While the retired Goldmanites weren’t directly involved in the 1MDB scandal, they ran the company during the time when rogue employees went undetected.","Cohn, meanwhile, is still trading on his contacts and reputation. Last month a blank-check company he is backing raised $720 million in an initial public offering and the sponsors, including Cohn, could collect as much as 20% of that amount as compensation. Against that backdrop, it wouldn’t cost him much to do the right thing. Next time an executive heads for the revolving door, though, Goldman should make sure it isn’t up for debate."

A lower efficiency ratio means a company is better at managing costs relative to revenue.","Failing to hit the targets would deal a blow to Chief Executive David Solomon, who has pledged to make Goldman Sachs look more like a conventional bank. However, analysts already anticipate target revisions and say there is little Solomon could do about the financial consequences of the pandemic.","Analyst estimates for Goldman’s ROTE do not exceed 12% in the coming years, and the consensus for its efficiency ratio is 63.2% by 2024, suggesting a lack of confidence in the bank’s targets, UBS analyst Brennan Hawken noted in a recent report.","So far this year, Goldman has had to delay the launch of a new digital wealth management initiative and slow hiring of private wealth advisors in response to the pandemic. The bank also slowed loan growth in the consumer division and set aside more money for loans that could go bad.","Helping Goldman’s profits, analysts expect trading revenue to stay aloft through year-end and for the bank to see cost-cutting benefits in 2021.","Goldman has been automating more roles and recently said it was laying off a “modest” number of staff, primarily in back-office functions. Automation is likely to accelerate as the pandemic continues, leading to more job cuts, the sources said.","Although Goldman may miss its pre-pandemic targets, Odeon Capital analyst Dick Bove thinks Solomon is pursuing the correct strategy in shaping Goldman more like a conventional bank.","“Overall, this company is moving in the right direction at the right time,” he said."

Bank of Montreal, which acquired mortgage security broker-dealer KGS-Alpha Capital Markets in 2018, is now actively trading residential mortgage-backed securities or RMBS, according to the source.",Bank of Montreal and JPMorgan did not respond to a request for comment. Goldman Sachs and Citi declined to comment.,"The trading boom is likely to provide a silver lining in an otherwise tough period for U.S. banks amid record low interest rates and rising bad debts. They start reporting third-quarter earnings next week, with JPMorgan and Citi kicking things off on Oct. 13.","The Fed’s coronavirus stimulus measures are responsible for the rally in mortgage bonds guaranteed by government agencies Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, say investors.","The premia that investors demanded to hold these bonds over risk-free Treasury debt, as measured by the Ginnie, Fannie and Freddie MBS ICE BofA indexes, were the widest since the 2007-2009 financial crisis in mid-March. That was just before the Fed announced it would increase its holdings of the securities, which are known as agency RMBS.","Since then, the Fed has bought more than $600 billion of agency RMBS and the spreads have narrowed by more than 50 basis points.",Graphic: U.S. March mortgage trade was golden opportunity -,"But the Fed isn’t the only one buying. Demand for safe-haven assets jumped when the pandemic first roiled financial markets, and has persisted since. Investors have rushed into agency RMBS, which have the benefit of government backing, while also offering a higher yield than Treasury debt.",Yields on Treasury bonds have fallen to all-time lows since the Fed cut interest rates near zero.,"“Agency MBS are Treasuries on steroids,” said Greg Parsons, chief executive officer at Semper Capital Management, a hedge fund specializing in mortgage-backed securities.","Some investors who bought heavily in March are making more than a percentage point in yields above the benchmark, according to investors, a huge return in this rate environment. The PIMCO Ginnie Mae fund has returned 4.59% in the year through August, versus its benchmark at 3.32%.","Average daily trading volume in agency RMBS hit a peak in March of this year, according to data from the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association and new issuance in 2020 stood at a record $2.6 trillion by the end of September.","Agency RMBS differ from the non-agency variety which gained notoriety for their central role in the 2008 crisis. If a homeowner defaults on a mortgage that is packaged into an agency RMBS, the agency -- Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or Ginnie Mae -- makes up for that defaulted principal. Investors in non-agency RMBS, however, absorb the loss.","Though defaults pose less of a problem, agency-backed RMBS do face a significant risk from borrowers pre-paying the mortgage, which shortens the duration of the security, reducing the number of installments paid to investors.",Pre-payments increase dramatically when low interest rates enable borrowers to refinance loans.,Semper Capital is not investing in traditional agency RMBS for precisely that reason.,"“If there’s one specific issue that is limiting the return potential on the agency side it is that pre-payment speeds remain elevated, which on the non-agency side is a strong positive for credit quality and performance, but on the agency side is really holding back price,” said Parsons.","But banks are likely to keep buying. Though they may be overtaken by the Fed this year, commercial banks are still currently the largest holders of agency MBS. Flooded with deposits during the coronavirus crisis, big banks have put that money to work in agency MBS, among other securities, bringing their holdings to $2.3 trillion according to Fed data.","“If you talk to a Wall Street firm, they’re making huge money selling to banks right now,” said Ken Shinoda, portfolio manager at DoubleLine, which manages strategies that invest in both agency and non-agency MBS.",“There is just insatiable demand for agency mortgages by all the depository institutions. And deposits are up. Savings rates are up. Everyone is kind of hoarding cash.”

Major League Baseball has dealt a blow to college sports. On Monday, days after the curtailed season started, the MLB postponed three games because more than a dozen Miami Marlins players and staff tested positive for Covid-19. Unlike many other professional leagues, the sluggers aren’t quarantined in a so-called bubble. Instead, they can move around in line with safety guidelines and even have to travel for games. This may not be a crackerjack plan.",The news calls into question the impending start of the college football season. Unpaid athletes can’t be locked in hotel rooms for months or put in harm’s way. So attempting any fixtures will require strict adherence to rules – a questionable strategy when dealing with 19- and 20-year-olds. Officials should have warned Americans months ago that shunning masks and neglecting to social distance could mean no University of Alabama and Louisiana State University game. That probably would have worked better than talking about a statistical curve. (By Anna Szymanski),"ALL PUMPED UP AND NOWHERE TO GO. Environmental benefits incurred as a result of industrial slowdowns during the Covid-19 pandemic could quickly be reversed. Research group Rystad Energy warned Tuesday that gas production from the Permian Basin could rebound in the second half of the year as pumping in the West Texas region picks up. The problem: Flaring, or burning unwanted gas in a highly pollutive manner, could ramp up too as investment in pipelines has waned.","In May, Stanford University scientist Rob Jackson calculated emissions had dropped as much as 17% globally since lockdowns started – but that the results would be short-lived. He noted carbon emissions dropped roughly 1.5% for a year during the global financial crisis, but roared back 5% the following year “as if nothing had changed.” Upgrading energy infrastructure is one way to sustainably reduce emissions. Perhaps the money not invested in pipelines could be spent on that. (By Lauren Silva Laughlin)","E-BOOM. It took a pandemic to bring the $330 billion luxury industry fully into the digital age. Top players such as Hermes International and LVMH have been relatively slow to embrace online selling. But when Covid-19 closed stores and hampered travel, firing up the internet channel became imperative. Gucci’s owner Kering said on Tuesday online sales increased nearly 50% in the first half of 2020. They now represent 13% of revenue, up from 6% last year.","Reopening physical outlets, even in the all-important mainland Chinese market, has not slowed the digital exuberance, says Kering. No wonder Italy’s Moncler, whose puffer jackets sell for $1000 or more, announced on Monday plans to double online business within three years, from what analysts estimate is currently 10% of revenue. A luxury digital revolution was probably inevitable, thanks to younger clients’ willingness to buy expensive items over the internet. The pandemic has accelerated the timing.

He later told the New York Post the event would never have been permitted the way it ended up. It’s a pity such a high-profile trial run for a Covid-beating event should fall short. Live performers of all stripes need to earn a living, charities need fundraising opportunities, and people need to share experiences.

The world’s best-known maker of protective masks has an oddly high-end challenge: a flourishing grey market. 3M told investors on Tuesday that it is ploughing resources into hotlines, social media monitoring and lawsuits to combat price-gouging and counterfeiting. Demand for life-saving respirators has soared far beyond what it can supply. While the group’s second-quarter revenue fell 12% year-on-year, sales of Covid-related masks grew by $225 million.","Luxury brands like Burberry and Louis Vuitton know the feeling. When a desire outpaces production, the market often finds a way. And winning back control comes at a cost. LVMH spent 43 million euros in 2019 on anti-counterfeiting. Burberry used to literally burn products to keep them out of dishonest hands. Of course, 3M can’t do that. Moreover, it can’t respond to demand by jacking up the price, as luxury houses do. That leaves it with the pitfalls of producing objects of desire, without one of the benefits. (By John Foley)","RAINY-DAY FUNDS. Singapore has dug deep. The government has turned to its sovereign wealth fund GIC’s reserves for an extraordinary $38 billion drawdown. That will help finance more than half of the economic support announced so far this year. This is the fund’s second-ever drawdown in nearly four decades, and is 10 times bigger than the one seen during the global financial crisis. It’s a sharp reminder of the burden the pandemic is placing on economies. Other governments can only borrow.","GIC foresees major changes in the global investment environment as a result of higher debt. Major central banks will now accommodate periods of above-target inflation, even during economic upswings.

If so, lower returns and increased volatility are the future. (By Una Galani)","FULL SPEED AHEAD. Peugeot Chief Executive Carlos Tavares is showing automakers a way out of their post-coronavirus funk. Shares in the $16 billion company rose by 4% on Tuesday after its car business generated 731 million euros operating profit in the first half despite a 35% annual drop in revenue, comfortably beating analysts’ forecasts. Vigorous cost-cutting kept Peugeot’s core operating profit margin positive at 3.7%. The company reckons sales in Europe, its biggest market, will drop by 25% this year compared with 2019. Increased efficiencies should, however, enable Tavares to comfortably beat a minimum 4.5% margin target next year.","Even so, investors remain hard to please. Tavares’s planned union with Italy’s Fiat Chrysler Automobiles, targets synergies with a present value of some 25 billion euros, according to a Breakingviews calculation. That’s only slightly lower than the two automakers’ combined market values. Peugeot’s pandemic performance is a start at winning over sceptics. (By Christopher Thompson)","COVID-19’S CASSANDRA. The world’s next global financial crisis may be on the horizon, the former chief of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has warned. Speaking in a recent interview, Joseph Yam sounded the alarm that the pandemic has brought a sudden stop to the global economy, which will have dire consequences for financial markets.","Too much volatility and money sloshing around – unresolved problems from earlier crashes in 1997 and 2008 – will make this impending financial crisis even harder to manage, Yam reckons.

Tencent may prove to be an exception. The Chinese goliath’s investment portfolio has surpassed $66 billion with stakes in music, fintech and more. Recent successes could validate the deal spree.","Two years ago, an essay entitled “Tencent has no dream” went viral in China. The author, a local tech journalist, accused the company that created WeChat, the world’s first all-in-one messaging “super-app”, of losing its inventive spirit and turning into an investment bank.","That same year, Tencent boss Pony Ma embarked on a frenzied buying binge, snapping up stakes in everything from Amer Sports, the Finnish maker of Wilson tennis racquets and other gear, to real estate conglomerate Dalian Wanda’s commercial property division. As with earlier investments, the strategic rationale was unclear. Research firm ITJuzi estimates that Tencent picked up a record 163 holdings in 2018, an average of three a week.","Even amid the pandemic, Tencent shows no signs of slowing down. Recent purchases include a Malaysian video-streaming service and minority stakes in Universal Music and Warner Music. That’s on top of a flurry of deals involving video-game rivals, e-sports companies, Australia’s Afterpay and Tesla’s Chinese challenger Nio. It is also eyeing a piece of China’s $17 billion iQiyi, according to sources cited by Reuters.","By global tech standards, Tencent stands out. Less acquisitive U.S. peers tend to focus on strategic targets, such as Facebook’s acquisitions of WhatsApp and Instagram or Apple’s purchase of headphone-maker Beats. Others, including Alphabet’s Google, have separate corporate venture arms.","In the People’s Republic, only $580 billion Alibaba has pockets deep enough to match Tencent’s. The e-commerce company’s investments totalled $50 billion as of March, nearly a quarter less than its arch-rival. Alibaba also tends to take full control of business units, including in food delivery and video-streaming, whereas Tencent prefers minority stakes outside of video-games and entertainment.","Its M&A appetite may derive from Goldman Sachs, where two of Ma’s top lieutenants worked before joining Tencent. One is Martin Lau, who chairs the investment committee. The other is the company’s chief strategy officer, James Mitchell. The duo is widely regarded as the driving force behind Tencent’s acquisitive nature. At a conference in January, Lau said the company had invested in over 800 companies since 2008, a fifth of which are valued at $1 billion or more. Returns last year hit some $2 billion, accounting for roughly 12% of the company’s total annual earnings.","As investments play a bigger and more important role, Tencent increasingly resembles Masayoshi Son’s SoftBank. Costly misadventures in WeWork and Uber left the Saudi-backed Vision Fund valued at just $70 billion in March, not much larger than Tencent’s portfolio.","Some of the deals are doing well. In 2012, Tencent bought a 40% stake in U.S.-based Epic Games at a valuation of less than $1 billion. The company behind “Fortnite”, even more popular during Covid-19 lockdowns, is now raising fresh funds at a $17 billion valuation, according to Bloomberg. Chinese e-commerce challenger Pinduoduo, which Tencent backed in its early days, is now worth over $100 billion. Its New York-listed shares have more than quadrupled since its initial public offering in 2018.","What’s more, Tencent benefits strategically too. E-commerce outfits, for example, can broaden the range of services offered on WeChat, making the all-in-one app and its mobile payments system even more indispensable to more than 1 billion monthly active users. Pinduoduo’s Groupon-like site, for instance, links directly to Tencent’s social network, which has benefitted both. Indeed, Lau has defended the company’s investment record by saying it cannot do everything itself and relies on outside partners.","Opacity has been a problem for shareholders. The company is spelling out more these days, including an annual return on its investment portfolio. It also created a separate website for the holdings. Because of Tencent’s size, however, even some large deals can be kept quiet.","Disclosure is also patchy. For example, a 5% stake in Tesla was revealed in 2017 with the electric-car maker’s boss, Elon Musk, tweeting his delight and Tencent extolling his “vision, ambition and execution.” The strategic rationale was unclear, though, and Tencent won’t even say if it still owns any shares. It does not appear as a significant owner, according to Eikon.",Messaging app operator Snap also said in its annual report that because of its capital structure neither it nor Tencent are obligated to say whether anything changes about the stake the Chinese company bought a few years ago.,"There may have been a few visible successes, but analyst Mark Artherton, who publishes on Smartkarma, estimates that more than 80% of Tencent’s balance sheet is in cash and investments that generate little meaningful profit.","That may not be much of an issue now with the company’s video-games division doing so well. Tencent is expected to generate some $26 billion in operating cash flow this year, based on forecasts compiled by Refinitiv. That would be up over a quarter from 2019, but growth is expected to slow to less than 15% by 2022. As that happens, the more scrutiny there will be on the expanding investment portfolio – and whether it is the best use of Tencent’s capital."

I sincerely doubt the 2nd Circuit will grant the stay. As I’ll explain, the court has twice agreed to Goldman’s interlocutory requests to review class certification rulings by the trial judge, U.S. District Judge Paul Crotty of Manhattan. And after the 2nd Circuit’s ruling in April, the bank asked for a rehearing, mustering considerable amicus support from the business lobby. The 2nd Circuit denied that request on June 15. The new stay motion, in other words, isn’t telling the 2nd Circuit anything it hasn’t already heard from Goldman and its supporters.",Want more On the Case? Listen to the On the Case podcast.,"But the stay motion serves as a preview of the arguments that Goldman Sachs will eventually make at the Supreme Court in a case that – at least according to the bank and the business lobby – gives shareholders nearly unfettered power to win certification of class actions based on anodyne and ubiquitous corporate mission statements. The Supreme Court, as you know, held in 2014’s Halliburton v. Erica P. John Fund that defendants are entitled to attempt to rebut the presumption that investors relied on corporate misrepresentations, the keystone of shareholder class actions. Goldman is poised to argue that the 2nd Circuit has tied defendants’ hands by refusing to consider the nature of the alleged corporate lies.","I reached out to Thomas Goldstein of Goldstein & Russell, who successfully represented the shareholders suing Goldman at the 2nd Circuit. He did not provide comment on Goldman’s motion. The lead plaintiff in the class action is the Arkansas Teacher Retirement System. Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd and Labaton Sucharow are lead counsel.","The case is based on Goldman Sachs’ notorious Abacus collateralized debt obligation, a subprime mortgage-based financial instrument that Goldman assembled in 2007 at the request of, and with assistance from, the hedge fund Paulson & Co. In 2010, Goldman reached a $550 million settlement with the Securities & Exchange Commission to resolve allegations that it duped Abacus investors by failing to disclose Paulson’s involvement – and failing to reveal that the hedge fund had simultaneously bet on the CDO to fail. (Goldman acknowledged in the settlement that its marketing materials contained incomplete information.)",The Arkansas Teachers’ case alleges that Goldman Sachs misled its shareholders in corporate statements about the bank’s robust conflict of interest policies and commitment to putting its clients’ interests ahead of its own. The shareholders’ theory is that Goldman’s share price remained artificially high because investors believed the bank’s allegedly false statements and ultimately fell when revelations about Abacus and related CDOs proved the falsity of those assurances.,"Goldman has long argued, among other points, that generic statements about business integrity were immaterial to investors. Broadly speaking, the bank contended that its share price did not fall because investors suddenly realized they’d been misled about Goldman’s commitment to clients’ interests – but rather because shareholders were rattled by news of the government’s investigation of Abacus and other Goldman CDOs.",The class action first came to the 2nd Circuit in 2018. The appeals court vacated Judge Crotty’s original class certification decision and remanded the case with instructions that he decide whether Goldman could meet a burden of persuasion to rebut the presumption that shareholders relied on its alleged misrepresentations.,"In the case’s second interlocutory trip to the appeals court, the 2nd Circuit majority, Judges Richard Wesley and Denny Chin, said Judge Crotty had fairly weighed the evidence when he concluded that the bank failed rebut the presumption. In dissent, Judge Richard Sullivan said the majority had looked at the issue from the wrong vantage point. No reasonable investor, Judge Sullivan said, could have relied on Goldman’s generic assurances about its business practices.","That’s the theme Goldman is emphasizing in the new stay motion, seemingly in a preview of the points it will eventually argue to the Supreme Court. (The bank has added counsel from Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison to the Sullivan & Cromwell team that has represented it throughout this decade-long case.) According to Goldman, the 2nd Circuit majority disregarded the Supreme Court’s directive in the 2014 Halliburton decision by failing to consider whether the bank’s allegedly deceptive representations about its business practices were inherently immaterial and therefore had no impact on Goldman’s share price.","“This case is an excellent vehicle for the Supreme Court to address whether the nature of challenged statements may be used to show lack of price impact at the class-certification stage, because that issue is outcome-determinative,” the motion said. “If the court had allowed itself to consider the nature of these generic statements, this case would have been decided in defendants’ favor.”","The Supreme Court held in 2013’s Amgen v. Connecticut Retirement Plans that shareholders need not prove the materiality of alleged corporate misrepresentations in order to win class certification. But Goldman’s stay motion argues that the 2nd Circuit went too far by deciding not even to consider materiality, ignoring Halliburton’s holding that (in the bank’s description) “defendants are entitled to present price impact evidence at the class-certification stage even if such evidence also bears on a merits issue.”","As I said, I don’t think the 2nd Circuit will be swayed by the motion. Will the Supreme Court? Goldman Sachs does not cite a circuit split on whether courts can consider the materiality of alleged misstatements in deciding if defendants have rebutted the presumption of reliance. Instead, Goldman appears to be hoping that the justices will take note of its argument that the 2nd Circuit has drastically expanded corporate exposure to shareholders by making it impossible to defeat class certification in cases based on generic statements of business principles.","That seems like a tough sell, but you can be sure Goldman won’t settle this case until it has made its pitch at the Supreme Court."

A month ago, analysts thought the decline would be under 5%, and at the start of the year they were targeting a 6% increase.","For the second quarter of 2020, the picture is starting to look more realistic. Earnings are forecast to slump nearly 40% from last year. But with revenue projected to be down only 10% in the three months to June, Wall Street may still, unfortunately, be behind the Covid-19 curve. For every company with top-line growth, like Facebook, there are others like American Airlines, which sees industry revenue down perhaps 95% in April compared to last year.

Exxon Mobil paid out $15 billion last year. Chevron put up $9 billion.

Lloyds Banking Group’s first-quarter earnings report, unveiled on Thursday by Chief Executive Antonio Horta-Osorio, was a tale of two numbers: a 1.4 billion pound impairment charge for bad debt, and a bumper 14.2% common equity Tier 1 capital ratio. The loan-loss figure was higher than expected, but much lower as a proportion of loans than peer Barclays. The capital ratio, meanwhile, represented a 45-basis point jump from the level at the end of 2019.","That’s arguably reassuring, since bank investors have been fretting about dilutive equity hikes. It’s also a risk, however: supervisors like the Bank of England have made it clear that lenders should be burning through their equity capital to help virus-hit firms and households.

(here)","Loss provisions at JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, Citigroup Inc C.N, Bank of America Corp BAC.N and Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N were four to nine times larger than Goldman’s, mostly because those banks have bigger consumer-lending businesses.","Goldman’s trading businesses reported their best results in five years and accounted for nearly 60% of the bank’s overall first-quarter revenue, compared with 40% for all of 2019.","Even though Goldman’s profit fell short of the average analyst prediction, its shares rose as much as 1.9% on Wednesday even as the broader market declined and other big banks fell sharply on loan-loss concerns. Goldman closed up 0.2% at $178.52.","“It really is a favorable business mix for this quarter,” said David Konrad, a bank analyst at D.A. Davidson & Co.","Goldman’s $5.2 billion in trading revenue was up 28% from the year-ago period. Its debt and equity underwriting businesses also did well, and executives suggested the burst of capital-markets activity that drove its first-quarter results could carry through in the second quarter.","The irony, Konrad said, is that the market is happy about short-term gains that previously haunted Goldman Sachs as it has tried to recalibrate its business model for the long-term.","“This dynamic may shift to a far more difficult environment for capital markets and investment banking and less provision headwinds,” Konrad said. “It’s a bit of timing for all of these banks.”","Goldman Sachs’ chief executive officer, David Solomon, has been trying to move the bank away from trading, which has fallen out of favor due to regulations imposed since the 2008 financial crisis, and because of its inherent volatility.","Solomon has been implementing a plan to expand into consumer banking, launch a treasury services business for corporations, grow wealth management, lend more to companies and shift trading to focus on asset managers, in addition to hedge funds.","It is hard to tell from the outside exactly what transactions boosted Goldman’s trading businesses, but gains seemed widespread. The bank highlighted better results in currencies, credit products, commodities, interest-rate products, market-making in equities and equities derivatives, and financing for trades. The only negative was mortgage trading.","Trading helped offset some $890 million in markdowns Goldman had to take on stocks, bonds, loans and private-equity assets it holds on its balance sheet as investments, as well as the credit-loss provisions for corporate loans it has extended.","Overall, the bank’s profit fell 49% to $1.1 billion, or $3.11 per share, from $2.2 billion, or $5.71, in the first quarter of 2019.","Analysts on average had expected a profit of $3.35 per share, according to the IBES estimate from Refinitiv.","Its net revenue was flat at $8.7 billion, compared to an average estimate of $7.9 billion.","On a conference call with analysts, Goldman executives said trading activity has remained robust so far in the second quarter and that there is a strong pipeline of deal and underwriting activity that may continue to boost results in the near term.",They also emphasized that the bank has no plans to change course from the strategic vision Solomon laid out before the coronavirus pandemic began strangling the economy.,"Even though its trading business stole the spotlight in the first quarter, Goldman added 80 clients to its recently launched corporate cash transactions business, grew consumer deposits by $12 billion and maintained previous operational targets.","Goldman may have to cut costs further and add to loan-loss provisions if the coronavirus downturn continues, but will not stray from a strategic plan management laid out in January, executives said.","“The strategic direction we laid out for the firm remains no less compelling,” Solomon said."

Analysts believe it will take at least a decade for the consumer bank to become as substantial as other major businesses.","But Marcus is a central pillar of Chief Executive Officer David Solomon’s vision for Goldman Sachs, whose 151-year history has had very little to do with Main Street. The consumer unit generates an outsized share of the Wall Street bank’s publicity.","“While Goldman has lots of good ideas, it needs to execute, especially in certain areas that are somewhat new to it,” Barclays analyst Jason Goldberg said.","Goldman unveiled Marcus in 2016 as a way to supplement falling income from trading, which has declined across Wall Street because of new regulations and shifting customer preferences.","The bank has invested heavily in the business, advertising lucrative savings rates, buying a personal-finance app and launching a credit card with Apple Inc last year to lure customers.",Those efforts have helped gather $60 billion in deposits and issue $7 billion in loans and credit card balances as of year-end.,"Analysts characterize that as fast growth for a bank that only entered the scene a few years ago, but they note that it came at a hefty cost and still represents a fraction of the balance sheets of big universal lenders like JPMorgan Chase & Co or Bank of America Corp.","Goldman set up a particular challenge for itself by not opportunistically buying a big retail bank or brokerage firm during the financial crisis when they had the chance, DBRS, Inc analyst Mike McTamney said.","Even its closest rival, Morgan Stanley, went through a transformative deal that changed the composition of its customers and revenue streams.","Even after hundreds of millions of dollars invested in Marcus, several analysts noted, trading accounted for 40% of Goldman’s annual revenue last year.","“Goldman Sachs failed to evolve as quickly as it should have,” said Mike Mayo, analyst at Wells Fargo & Co. “They were strategically complacent.”","Although Goldman has been publicly traded since 1999, a bank since 2008 and part of the Dow Jones Industrial Average since 2013, it has only recently come around to the idea that it needs to act more like peers. The investor day itself came after years of analysts and investors demanding more disclosures and transparency.","As Reuters reported in November and management confirmed this month, Goldman plans to move away from a hard-to-measure $5 billion revenue target executives had outlined in 2017. Instead, they plan to offer metrics like a bank-wide efficiency target and granular details about individual businesses, the way rivals do. (reut.rs/32y3xdi)","But the central question remains how Goldman will transform itself from a Wall Street bank into something that looks more like universal rivals, especially without performing an acquisition, analysts said.","Management has toyed with the idea since the crisis, even publicly musing about it from time-to-time. Solomon's predecessor, Lloyd Blankfein, has said that not acquiring a big retail bank was his biggest regret as CEO, and former finance chief Marty Chavez said in 2018 that Goldman still had interest in doing so. (reut.rs/2vkXq0p)","However, it would be much much more expensive and difficult for Goldman to do such a deal today.","Although the regulatory environment has eased during the Trump administration, there would be heavy political pressure against Goldman buying one of its peers, especially ahead of the 2020 elections. And, despite being the fifth-biggest U.S. bank by assets, Goldman’s market value of $84 billion is comparable to smaller regional rivals it might want to buy, which makes such a transaction financially difficult.",Goldman’s share price of $238.14 as of Monday’s close means investors value it at less than what it says its stated assets are worth. That “multiple” harms its ability to buy banks that are valued more richly.,"Solomon, a longtime investment banker, might seem like the most likely person to do such a deal, but he might be stuck growing Goldman’s consumer bank from the ground up, analysts said. Sources inside the bank said he thinks Goldman would need to be trading around $400 to think about doing a big deal.","“It would be really challenging to grow 50% through an acquisition,” said David Konrad, an analyst at D.A. Davidson. “Goldman doesn’t really have the multiple.” (Reporting By Elizabeth Dilts Marshall, additional reporting by Lauren LaCapra, David French and Greg Roumeliotis; editing by Lauren LaCapra and David Gregorio)"

Banks give you a model. You say to the company, well, if you can prove to us that the model actually does what it does, then it’s possible that the company is worth this in the public markets,” Solomon said.","WeWork was considering a valuation of as low as $10 billion and $12 billion at the time it was preparing for an IPO in September, Reuters reported at the time.","Solomon told a conference panel at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland that the process worked because due diligence and feedback by potential IPO investors “ground it in reality.”","While 2019 had promised to be a bumper year for IPOs, investor confidence fizzled out. Shares of some high-profile start-ups such as Uber Technologies Inc and Lyft Inc languished in the months following their listings. A few companies, such as WeWork, canceled their stock market debuts, because of investor pushback against their valuations.","“If you bought a package of all the IPOs that came to market in 2019 I think you returned 34% and outperformed the broader market a little bit. But there were companies that did not perform well and did not meet the expectations that were set,” Solomon said.","Cheap money, driven by low interest rates, is pushing investors to take risks, and this has led them to overvalue some companies’ growth projections and not focus on their underlying earnings, Solomon said.","Solomon added that the fact that Saudi Aramco’s $29.4 billion IPO attracted primarily domestic, rather than international, investors last month was because the valuation pitched to them on the local exchange was not attractive enough."

The U.S. bank is advising the British grocer on a potential $9 billion exit from Southeast Asia. Up to one fifth of the operations by value sit in Malaysia. That means the Wall Street bank led by David Solomon may earn fees from the sale of assets in a country where Goldman is still tangling with authorities for its role in the multi-billion-dollar 1MDB sovereign fund scandal.,"The bank is serving a long-standing client: Goldman has worked for Tesco on corporate bond issues, asset-backed securities and more over the decades. It advised on the company’s 2003 acquisition, and subsequent exit, from Japan. Most of the assets now under review by the 25 billion-pound chain are headquartered in Bangkok and the rest in Kuala Lumpur.","The mandate, though, is significant for a bank that has been tied up in controversy for fees pocketed on three 1MDB bond issues totalling $6.5 billion in 2012 and 2013. The Goldman banker who led those deals, Tim Leissner, went on leave in early 2016, and eventually pleaded guilty to money laundering charges. Dealogic has no record of Goldman earning investment banking fees in Malaysia between 2017 and 2019. That’s a long stretch, even in a small market where business is lumpy.","Goldman is advising on the sale from London and will most likely be paid by a UK-based company. That kind of a remote setup is not uncommon for global dealmakers. Still, local authorities seeking a settlement over 1MDB may be irritated by the thought of the bank earning fees from the sale of Malaysian assets.","Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad in December said that compensation of “one point something billion” dollars offered by the bank was too small. Meanwhile, criminal charges filed earlier by Malaysia against 17 current and former directors of the bank remain outstanding. Goldman senior executives have publicly said that the bank wants to put the issue behind it.","Goldman will be keen to demonstrate that it is ready and able to serve all the needs of its multinational clients, and the Tesco deal would test the reach of Malaysian authorities. Supermarkets might become an unwelcome reminder to politicians that capital is global."

The collective investment community is saying that doesn’t cut it,” said Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo. “They need to provide something that increases confidence so, for the first time ever, they’re going to lift the curtain behind the scenes at Goldman Sachs.”",Goldman declined to comment on the $5 billion goal or what new targets might be unveiled at the investor event in January. It referred Reuters to an interview on Tuesday in which Solomon said there would be no major disclosures.,"“We’ve got very, very good businesses that we’re very proud of and we’d like to evolve those businesses a little bit. I wouldn’t expect any big reveal,” he told Bloomberg TV.","The $5 billion target was at one time a crucial benchmark for whether Goldman could transform itself from a Wall Street trading house with stalling profits into a more diversified bank with potential to grow, analysts said.","In the early days of his tenure it was also an important metric for Solomon, who took the reins from longtime CEO Lloyd Blankfein in October 2018. The 57-year-old was a key architect of Goldman’s overhaul plan in his prior role as operating chief, sources within the bank said.",Goldman executives said a year ago that the bank was ahead of schedule on the $5 billion goal.,"There is a lot of appetite among investors for information about Goldman’s progress reducing its reliance on unpredictable trading revenues and growing more stable businesses, some analysts said.","Solomon had initially planned to launch a strategic update in the spring of 2019. But he postponed it until January, saying he wanted to get it right rather than rush it.",Goldman has had little choice but to re-invent itself.,"The bank’s profits were stifled by tougher regulations after the 2007-2009 financial crisis, changing customer preferences and technology shifts that made some businesses less profitable.","Goldman was also more skewed than its rivals toward trading, and it has seen pretax earnings in that part of the business fall 84% from 2009 to 2018, according to regulatory filings. Those profits are down another 7% so far this year.","Goldman shares are trading at 0.9 times the value of its assets, among the lowest of the biggest U.S. banks."

When they don’t, it gets a lot of attention.","In May last year, Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk refused to answer questions from analysts about the company’s capital requirements, calling the questions “boring” and “not cool” during a conference call to discuss Tesla’s performance. He later criticized several analysts directly for negative calls.","At the beginning of its fiscal year, Apple changed where it accounts for the value and costs of free services - like Apple Maps - and moved it into its services segment. Previously this was accounted for under the individual products.","In his note, Goldman’s Hall said Apple was likely to treat TV+ subscriptions in a similar way, by accounting for it as a discounted bundle of a free service paired with a hardware purchase. Hall said that would result in Apple investors seeing lower average selling prices for iPhones and other Apple devices but faster growth in the company’s services segment.","Many Apple investors have come to focus on growth in the services segment as the global smart phone market has stagnated, with Apple shares rising this year despite year over year declines in iPhone sales for its most recent two quarters."

Many economists and analysts believe the United States is overdue for a recession, which makes the timing of Goldman’s card roll-out less than ideal.","Bank executives said last month that they have tamped down efforts to grow consumer loans because of heightened credit risk. As of July, Marcus had a $6 billion book of unsecured loans, which mostly stem from consumers who consolidated existing credit-card debt into a cheaper product. Marcus also held more than $50 billion in retail deposits.","As the business has grown, analysts complain that Goldman is not disclosing enough details about the people it is lending to, such as their credit scores or delinquency rates. They also worry that Goldman is spending a lot on something that is unlikely generate meaningful profits for some time.","Over the past few years, Goldman has spent $1.3 billion, before taxes, on new business initiatives, Goldman Chief Financial Officer Stephen Scherr told analysts last month. The initiatives are the Apple card, Marcus’ digital offerings and a transaction banking product.","Those three projects dragged down Goldman’s return-on-equity by 60 basis points in the second quarter, Scherr said. But he predicted they will bolster profits once they are running at full-scale.","Analysts believe Goldman’s credit-card endeavor will be fruitful over the long-run, even if it takes awhile to get off the ground.","A few years from now, the card will only represent 1-2% of Goldman’s earnings, Wells Fargo & Co analyst Mike Mayo predicted. But, he said, the bank has the advantage of starting from scratch, unlike rivals that are dealing with costly branch networks and old technology.","“These are two iconic brands that are partnering to better compete as part of the 21st century digital banking wars,” May told Reuters. “It is part of Goldman’s pivot.

Based on a rough calculation, that means Raisin is worth more than 500 million euros.","In an era of very low interest rates, Raisin is positioning its “deposits-as-a-service” model as a chance for savers to scour the market for better deals, and as a way for banks that need liquidity to access additional funding.","Raisin, which collects an undisclosed margin on deposits sourced via its platform, has brokered a total of 14 billion euros in deposits for 185,000 European customers, on behalf of 80 banks. That’s up from 10 billion euros at the start of 2019.","Frank Freund, co-founder and chief financial officer, said the $12.7 trillion U.S. savings pile was too big an opportunity to ignore. “The deposit base in the United States is larger than in all of Europe combined,” he told Reuters in an interview.","While large U.S. banks are typically overliquid, said Freund, Raisin would offer a route for smaller banks to grow and manage their deposit bases once it launches there next year.","Raisin follows Berlin-based smartphone bank N26, with which it partners, in expanding into the United States - part of a wider push by European fintechs seeking to achieve scale, generate meaningful revenue and turn a profit.","Goldman has launched an online bank called Marcus and while its investment in Raisin is not directly tied to that venture, it did show that the investment bank “understood the power of retail”, said Freund.","Raisin, whose backers include Index Ventures, Orange Digital Ventures and Paypal, operates under the brand WeltSparen in German-speaking markets.

However, the bank’s backlog of deals declined, indicating revenue may be subdued in future quarters.","Total revenue of $8.81 billion missed Wall Street’s $8.99 billion estimate. The biggest drop came from trading, which was hurt by lower market volatility and the impact of the U.S. government shutdown.","Rivals JPMorgan Chase & Co and Citigroup Inc reported declines in trading revenue of 10 percent and 6 percent, respectively.","Despite sour revenue, Goldman’s profit beat Wall Street’s view, which analysts attributed to a sharp drop in compensation expenses.","Earnings attributable to common shareholders fell 20 percent to $2.2 billion, or $5.71 per share, from $2.7 billion, or $6.95 per share, in the year-ago period.

After the deal, that fund transferred a minority stake in Boyd to the Cooperation fund, the sources said.",A Goldman spokeswoman declined to comment on why Goldman’s Boyd-related announcements did not mention the Cooperation fund.,One Chinese company that sought to acquire Boyd outright had balked at the regulatory hurdles.,"Kangde Xin Composite Material Group Co Ltd, a Chinese laminates manufacturer, said in regulatory announcements that it abandoned a bid for Boyd because it thought the “China-U.S trade friction” would make regulatory approval of the deal difficult.",Kangde Xin did not respond to a request for comment. Investment bankers said the company’s failure to buy Boyd showed CIC would not have been able to do the deal without the structure offered by the Goldman fund.,"“This is a really innovative structure, one which could go a long way to enable them to undertake transactions that would be hard for them to do otherwise,” said Euan Rellie, co-founder of BDA Partners, an investment bank that specializes in cross-border deals, referring to the Goldman fund and CIC.","CIC, whose assets under management are approaching $1 trillion, also has investments in other private equity funds. But CIC does not typically help companies acquired by private equity funds it invests in grow in China.","CIC also calls itself an “anchor investor” in the Cooperation fund, and the sources said it holds a sizeable minority stake that is larger than its typical private equity fund investments.","“CIC is not involved in the investment management of the fund nor the operation of the fund’s portfolio companies. CIC’s role is to help Goldman Sachs, as the investment manager, identify and pursue opportunities for portfolio companies to do more business in China,” the Goldman spokeswoman said.","The Cooperation fund, which targets $5 billion in investment capital, plans to execute between one and three deals a year on average, adding up to as many as 12 over the duration of the fund, two of the sources said.","The fund is the most advanced in a series of similar investments by CIC. In an interview with Chinese state-owned newspaper Securities Times earlier this month, CIC’s president, Tu Guangshao, said bilateral cooperation funds were a strategy to “achieve a more favorable foreign investment regulatory environment” and “remove some barriers in cross-border investment.”","Tu said CIC has inked a letter of intent for a Britain-China fund, signed a contract for a Japan-China Industrial Cooperation Fund and is “in preparation for” China cooperation funds with Italy and France.","“When you get a couple more cases like this that look successful, other sovereign wealth funds and foreign investors will adopt this model,” said James Lewis, senior vice president at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank."

[O/R]","Crude oil prices are on course for the best quarter since mid-2016, with a 25 percent gain so far.","“Physical markets have driven the rally in prices this year while net speculative length has remained at depressed levels given high fundamental uncertainty and last year’s volatile fourth quarter,” Goldman said.

They agreed to discuss internal strategy on the condition they not be named.","The bank, which will earn fees and gain a captive client base for its foreign exchange business, could offer existing corporate clients more on deposits if they sign up for Goldman’s cash management services, a person familiar with the plan told Reuters.","Long considered a low-margin, utility-like service, the wholesale payments and cash management business generated about $250 billion in global revenue in 2017 for big banks, according to management consulting firm Oliver Wyman.",The steady stream of income has grown more attractive to banks that have been shifting away from volatile areas such as trading and investment banking in the aftermath of the financial crisis a decade ago.,"Citigroup Inc C.N, JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, Bank of New York Mellon Corp BK.N, HSBC Holdings PLC HSBA.L, Standard Chartered PLC STAN.L and Deutsche Bank AG DBKGn.DE currently dominate the market, handling corporations' payments and receivables across different regions.","As Goldman seeks to grow stable revenue by adding a cash management service for clients whom it already offers hedging and strategic advice, the investment bank further evolves to match rival universal banks’ range of businesses.","Goldman Sachs is about half way to a goal management set in 2017 to generate $5 billion more in annual revenue by next year, largely by boosting reliable, fee-based businesses.","However, rivals privately scoff at the idea Goldman can gain significant market share in a business where contracts often last five years, clients tend to stick with their banks and a global network of banking licenses greases the wheels.","“The regulatory and operational costs of building a global cash management platform will be very steep and will take many years to achieve the scale that will justify the costs,” said a senior commercial banker at a large European bank.","“Large multinational companies are consolidating the number of banks they deal with, and they don’t tend to switch service providers frequently for workday functions like facilitating supplier payments and managing payrolls.”","Nonetheless, Goldman believes it can make inroads.","Its investment bankers have heard corporate treasurers at big U.S. multinational corporations complain that other banks’ systems are clunky and outdated, one person familiar with Goldman’s plans said. Goldman will try to woo those accounts with a user-friendly interface and other improvements, and eventually hopes to be the third or fourth bank corporate clients use, in addition to other banks, for cash management.","Later this year, Goldman will become its own first client by moving its deposits from other banks onto its own cash management platform. Goldman stands to earn money from cash management in three ways: fees earned for processing funds, fees earned on exchanging a client’s cash into other currencies during a transaction, and by using deposits as operational account balances, a cheaper alternative to wholesale funding.","Oliver Wyman predicts that wholesale payments and cash management revenue will grow 5 percent annually over the next five years. Growing volumes and rising interest rates will more than offset narrowing profit margins caused by increased competition, the consulting firm said.","Paying clients more for deposits and offering new technology is a strategy Goldman used when it launched Marcus, its online retail bank, in 2016.","It has paid off. Marcus had $30 billion of deposits in the United States and the United Kingdom and $4 billion in loans as of November, and is contributing about $200 million to Goldman’s revenue, according to a November presentation.","In recent months, Goldman has advertised that it is hiring cash management compliance, technology, and legal professionals.","In one LinkedIn post seeking applications for lead data architect in the commercial banking engineering team, Goldman said it was looking for “innovative solutions to traditional banking activities” by combining the “heritage of a 148-year-old financial institution with the agility and entrepreneurial spirit of a tech start-up.”"

The new Goldman Sachs boss starts 2019 with one of Wall Street’s most prestigious jobs, and something to prove. This could be the first year in over a decade that the $63 billion bank starts with a smaller market capitalization than its chief rival, Morgan Stanley.","Goldman set out in 2017 to create $5 billion of new revenue streams, and Solomon starts with half that figure already in the bag. But there’s a lot to play for. Morgan Stanley boss James Gorman runs a bank with earnings that are lower but less subject to the vicissitudes of the market. Goldman makes around 57 percent of its revenue from predictable businesses other than trading and investment. At Morgan Stanley it’s nearly two-thirds.","Solomon is growing Goldman’s private wealth business, which services the ultra-rich, adding almost one-third more advisers by 2020. He could go further by addressing one of Goldman’s least lustrous businesses: asset management. That generates stable, predictable fee income. But its operating margin of just over 20 percent is half what the group’s investment bank makes, and below the 33 percent industry average, as measured by McKinsey.","The bar for doing a big deal is extremely high, Solomon has said. But buying a rival like the $22 billion T. Rowe Price, which has double Goldman’s profitability in asset management, would help. It would take Goldman’s client assets to $2.6 trillion and boost stable revenue sources to over 60 percent of the total.","There’s one big, shadowy problem: 1MDB. Goldman is being investigated by the Department of Justice and the Federal Reserve for its role raising funds for the Malaysian fund in 2012 and 2013, some of which ended up paid out as bribes. Two former Goldmanites have been indicted; others knew about the misdeeds, the DOJ says. A 10-digit fine is likely, but a time-suck for Solomon is certain.","Expect Goldman to settle as early as it can. But Solomon will probably have to oversee a sweeping internal cleanup, and – even though not implicated in 1MDB himself – could be called to Washington to answer publicly to a newly Democrat-run House of Representatives. All when he’d rather be growing his way to greatness, and showing Morgan Stanley a clean pair of heels.","- This is a Breakingviews prediction for 2019.

We are very active in both the U.S. and Brazilian markets,” said Roderick Greenlees, global head of investment banking at Itaú BBA.","But local banks may have a tough time reeling in deep-pocketed investors like Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc and Alibaba’s payment affiliate Ant Financial, both cornerstone investors in StoneCo’s $1.5 billion IPO in October.","A final lure of U.S. markets to certain Brazilian startups are capital structures that allow controlling shareholders to keep most voting power.

Abu Dhabi’s sovereign fund is suing the U.S. investment bank in New York for its role in the Malaysian fund scandal. The damages sought could exceed Goldman’s average annual net profit over three years of $5.4 billion. The longer the fight drags out, the worse the fallout looks.","Aggrieved investors smell blood after former Goldman partner Tim Leissner pleaded guilty to conspiring to launder money and other charges filed by U.S. authorities. New revelations in the New York Times that then-Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein met privately with Jho Low, the alleged mastermind of the scandal, alongside an Abu Dhabi fund executive will weaken any defence that this was the work of rogue employees.","Abu Dhabi’s lawsuit comes on top of growing expectations of a hefty settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice. Goldman could pay a fine of up to $1.2 billion plus return $600 million in fees and revenue the bank made arranging three 1MDB bonds, reckons a Morgan Stanley banks analyst. Two of those bonds were jointly guaranteed by International Petroleum Investment Company, which has now been folded into Mubadala, another Abu Dhabi fund.","The round-robin of accusations is growing. Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad’s new administration in Malaysia wants back fees it paid Goldman, and is also trying to wriggle out of a separate settlement with Abu Dhabi it says is worth about $5.8 billion. Under that London consent award, 1MDB and Malaysia agreed to take responsibility for the principal and interest of the $3.5 billion IPIC-guaranteed bonds.","Goldman is now caught in the middle as neither Abu Dhabi nor Malaysia wants to be left holding the embarrassing liabilities due in 2022. It’s not clear how well Abu Dhabi’s claim will hold up given it is also accusing others in the same lawsuit, including two of IPIC’s own former top employees allegedly bribed by Goldman. The bank says it expects to vigorously contest the charges.","The emirate also has tried and failed to take on Wall Street before.

Capital, Olympus Partners and Charlesbank Capital Partners. These firms focus on “middle-market” transactions, which Goldman classifies as acquisitions between $500 million and $3 billion in size, a far cry from the mega-deals it has built its investment banking brand on.","Over a meal of Atlantic halibut and dry-aged ribeye steaks, Gregg Lemkau, co-head of Goldman’s investment bank, and Alison Mass, in charge of the financial sponsors coverage group, pressed one message: Goldman is serious about advising on relatively small leveraged buyouts.","The bank has sought to back up this claim with a major hiring spree. It created a dedicated team for M&A execution within its “financial sponsors” group covering private equity clients, and has grown this group from zero to 27 bankers in the last three years. Previously, M&A execution was handled by the bank’s sector teams.","The initiative illustrates how Goldman, already the No. 1 bank for private equity firms by fees earned, is looking between the sofa cushions for any new source of income to hit its goal, unveiled last year, of growing revenues by $5 billion by 2020.","Goldman’s new chief executive, David Solomon, is seeking to remove the bank’s reliance on volatile trading revenue, making expanding the already dominant investment bank a key part of this strategy.","Goldman has already been scoring its fair share of smaller deals. League table data from industry tracker Dealogic show Goldman has held a top three position in fees earned from U.S. private equity-related deals between $500 million and $3 billion since at least 2013. However, in 2018, the bank is on track to have its highest fee share in that segment since 2014, Dealogic data showed.","“We had a look within the investment bank where we could grow our share of the pie and they saw an opportunity in the middle market,” Goldman’s Mass said in an interview.","One hurdle Goldman faces in implementing this strategy is attracting enough senior talent. Traditionally, the financial sponsors team was seen internally as training ground for many investment bankers, who learned to work on deals before they cultivated relationships with the corporate world’s movers and shakers, bank insiders said.","Many investment banks that are focused on the middle market, on the other hand, often boast careerists who have spent decades cultivating relationships with private equity firms that do smaller deals.","To counter this, Goldman Sachs has poached senior bankers covering private equity firms from the likes of Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse Group AG.","There are plans to grow the M&A team further, especially in Europe, Mass and David Friedland, global head of the sponsor M&A team, said, without elaborating on the potential new hires.","“One thing we’ve tried to address is the misperception, often put forth by our competitors, that our most experienced M&A people were not also working on these (middle-market) deals,” said Friedland.","T. J. Maloney, chairman and CEO of Lincolnshire Management, a private equity firm specializing in the middle market, said he had seen more deal flow from Goldman in the last couple of years.","“They made a push by hiring some pretty good people in the middle market, people who are really focused on covering sponsors like us,” said Rich Lawson, co-founder and CEO of HGGC, another private equity firm which invests in middle-market businesses.","The new M&A group for private equity firms at Goldman was the brainchild of Stephanie Cohen, who last year was tapped by the bank to be its head of strategy. The group has helped diversify the bank’s fee revenue from private equity firms beyond the sector’s biggest players, such as Blackstone, Apollo Global Management LLC and KKR.","“Over the course of the last two or three years, they’ve done a very good job reestablishing the connection with folks like us,” said Scott Sperling, co-president at Thomas H. Lee Partners, another U.S. private equity firm."

Morgan Stanley’s chief executive beat his own earnings target again in the latest quarter – and his downtown rival’s returns, too, after stripping out surprisingly lower pay. It’s yet more confirmation that Gorman has built a strong business worthy of commanding a higher multiple than its old adversary.","At first take, Morgan Stanley’s showing in the three months to the end of June doesn’t look much different than Goldman’s. Earnings of $2.3 billion, unveiled on Wednesday, equate to an annualized return on equity of 13 percent. That’s at the top end of what Gorman’s shooting for, but only just ahead of his rival’s 12.8 percent.","Goldman, though, only managed that return by setting aside just 37 percent of revenue to cover compensation. Usually the Wall Street firm puts around 41 percent into the pot in the first three quarters of the year. Finance chief Martin Chavez explained the ratio drop on Tuesday’s earnings call by saying “it’s strong revenue growth year-on-year and our emphasis on profitability.”","That certainly helped. If Goldman had left the ratio at its regular level, pre-tax earnings would have been almost $400 million lower and return on equity just 11.1 percent.","Retaining more earnings for shareholders is a worthy move – and still leaves the annualized average pay and benefits package at almost $400,000 per Goldman employee. But it may just turn out to be a one-off to help with more volatile underlying earnings.","Morgan Stanley’s top and bottom lines look more stable, not least because it is not experiencing such wild swings in fixed-income trading – it restructured that business after suffering similar volatility several years ago. Nor does it have the lumpy results generated by Goldman’s investing and lending unit. And Gorman has put more emphasis on less risky business that requires less capital. Wealth management now accounts for 36 percent of earnings.","Goldman’s departing boss, Lloyd Blankfein, belatedly started the shift away from an excessive reliance on trading a couple of years ago. David Solomon, an investment banker who officially takes over in October, wants to augment that by shaking up Goldman’s processes and management structure, according to the Wall Street Journal. Watching James Gorman’s success should embolden him to push ahead."

(Reuters Breakingviews) - Goldman Sachs is playing follow-someone-else’s leader. The $87 billion Wall Street firm is expected to announce early this week a career investment banker as its next chief executive. David Solomon comes from the side of Goldman that advises clients rather than the bit that trades securities and produced current chief Lloyd Blankfein. It further de-emphasizes the role that part of the business plays. It’s also something Morgan Stanley did almost a decade ago.","Market making used to be the firm’s powerhouse. But it’s driven by clients’ whims. When they’re not in the mood, or the market doesn’t cooperate, it suffers. Goldman’s unit is also more skewed than rivals to hedge funds and other investors.","This time last year, Goldman reported a 40 percent drop in fixed-income trading as it suffered its worst quarter for commodities trading on record. In September executives put a plan in place to fix the division’s troubles. This year’s second-quarter results, due on Tuesday, will show how well that’s working.","Trading, though, made up just $1 billion of the $5 billion in new revenue initiatives Blankfein and his lieutenants unveiled. The rest is tied to earnings streams that the bank can either control more effectively, or that are more predictable - like advising on deals, collecting commissions, and retail banking in its Marcus outfit.","Goldman is a bit slow on the uptake here. These less capricious businesses have been surprisingly stable even as market-making revenue has fallen and Goldman’s own investment bets have flopped around. But they haven’t really grown, sticking at or below $20 billion on a rolling 12-month basis since the financial crisis, based on a Breakingviews analysis. Trading and investments, meanwhile, fell from the majority of the top line to around 41 percent.","Morgan Stanley started 10 years ago to play down what was an admittedly weaker fixed-income trading franchise. It expanded its wealth-management business and soon promoted its boss, James Gorman, to be CEO. He talks up the benefit of stable revenue and says he wants to ensure his firm does fine in bad times. He has made its smaller bond- and currency-trading unit more profitable – and last week promoted its architect, Ted Pick, to run the entire investment bank, thus making him a candidate for the top job.","Solomon, who moonlights as DJ D-Sol and extols the benefits of a healthy work-life balance, isn’t just a Gorman do-over. Goldman’s bigger M&A franchise sets it apart from its rival, and the firm is much lighter on wealth management. Goldman will always be different, but Solomon’s tune is one bank investors should find pleasingly familiar."

Hedging at lower levels limits the ability of producers to take advantage of a subsequent rally in prices - but it also protects them if the price of oil should fall to lower levels.","That kind of volatile trading pattern was present throughout 2017, so producers remained protected even after oil dropped off from an early-year rally. That in part helped production in the United States continue to grow, eventually rising to an all-time record late in 2017 of more than 10 million barrels a day.","In 2018, oil has been steadily rising, which presents a risk for producers if they hedge at levels below the current price, so some companies elected not to hedge.","“We didn’t leave money on the table by hedging too soon,” said Harold Hamm, chief executive of Continental Resources, on the company’s first quarter conference call earlier this year. The company, one of the largest shale producers in North Dakota, did not have any crude oil hedges as of the end of the first quarter.","Hedging could restrain ramping activity and increase focus on “capital discipline,” Goldman said.","“We believe producers may continue to tactically add oil hedges at current futures to mitigate oil price volatility in 2019, which could support greater capex,” the investment bank said in its note.",It said the majority of production growth in 2018 was expected to come from producers hedged above 50 percent.,"Devon Energy Corp and Noble Energy Inc added the most 2018 oil hedging contracts after fourth quarter earnings, the bank said."

Among the changes were a lowering of the headline corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 21 percent and the introduction of a one-time mandatory cash repatriation tax.,"Waldron, whose bank advises companies on how to defend themselves against activist investors, said that a big question on his clients’ minds is whether shareholders are going to give companies the time they need to decide how to deploy cash.","“Is pressure going to mount to come out with a capital allocation plan that’s fairly defined? How much is going into the business, how much is going to return capital to shareholders and how much will go to M&A?,” Waldron said.","Share buybacks have been a popular tool among companies to return money to impatient investors. For example, Apple Inc AAPL.O earlier this week promised shareholders $100 billion in additional stock buybacks, the starkest example yet of how companies are using the mountain of overseas cash suddenly freed up by the tax overhaul.","Other companies announcing plans to return cash to shareholders recently include Facebook Inc FB.O, AbbVie Inc ABBV.N and Broadcom Inc AVGO.O.","Activist shareholders are paying attention. TCI Fund Asset Management said in March that Altaba Inc AABA.O, a company with a market capitalization of $57 billion that used to be a part of Yahoo Inc and holds large stakes in Alibaba Group Holdings BABA.N and Yahoo Japan Corp 4689.T, should take advantage of U.S. tax cuts and liquidate its assets.","“We’re seeing more (activist shareholder) campaigns this year than in the past three years,” Waldron said. The proliferation of activist campaigns is like “throwing gasoline on the fire,” boosting mergers and acquisitions, Waldron added.",(This story has been refiled to fix cash repatriation tax reference in paragraph five.)

Martin Chavez whether it would simply buy a brick-and-mortar bank.","After explaining that Goldman has a history of building businesses internally, and a preference for “bolt-on” acquisitions, if any, Chavez suggested that management routinely considers more transformative deals.","“We are evaluating all these acquisitions, including things that you describe,” he said. “We are open-minded and it’s all part of the consideration.”","Goldman got into consumer lending much later than big U.S. banking peers, and analysts have asserted on and off through the years that acquiring a big consumer lender would help even out volatile results from businesses like trading and investment banking.","Unlike most rivals, Goldman did not make any significant acquisitions during the 2007-2009 financial crisis. Such a deal could be more difficult to accomplish now, as the industry has consolidated, values have risen and more regulatory hurdles have been put in place.","Since launching its digital consumer bank Marcus in 2016, Goldman has been growing the business by paying up for deposits, offering new products like home improvement loans and recently acquiring Clarity Money, a personal finance smartphone app.","Marcus is now lending out $3 billion of its more than $20 billion in deposits, Chavez said, making it a much smaller bank with a much lower loan-to-deposit ratio than lenders like JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, Bank of America Corp BAC.N, or even its closest peer, Morgan Stanley MS.N.","During the planning process that led to the launch of Marcus, Goldman considered “well over 100” ideas in consumer finance and may still execute some of them, Chavez said. Among areas Goldman may enter: credit cards, wealth management, retirement products and personal finance.","But before doing so, management considers factors including whether a business has “substantial pain points” for customers, whether it fits into Goldman’s strengths and culture, and whether it would generate attractive shareholder returns, he noted.","“We still refer back to that set because it’s quite comprehensive,” said Chavez, “and the world changes and evolves.”"

But it’s not investment bankers gathering here. Instead, it’s a comedy show arranged by Marcus, the company’s online retail bank. The unit’s edgier approach to business - and marketing - is giving Goldman a buzz it has sorely lacked.","The $98 billion firm run by Lloyd Blankfein has struggled since last decade’s financial crisis to stand out as the elite performer it once was. Poor form in trading fixed income, currency and commodities in recent quarters is a big reason why.","Judging by results for the first three months of this year, unveiled on Tuesday, that division is improving. FICC revenue doubled from a year earlier, to $2 billion, the best performance in three years. But it’s far from its glory days: its average quarterly top line in 2009 was almost $6 billion. And an annualized return on equity just above 15 percent marks Goldman as a whole as a solid franchise, but it doesn’t exude excitement.","Marcus does. It now embodies the hungry approach to business that used to define Goldman. It’s growing fast – from a small base – boosting retail loans by more than 50 percent to $3 billion in the first three and a bit months of this year. And that was after Blankfein urged executives to grow slowly and get it right, Marcus’s chief commercial officer, Omer Ismail, told attendees at the LendIt Fintech conference in San Francisco last week.","It’s also cranking out deals. On Sunday Marcus bought Clarity Money, a 15-month-old app allowing people to aggregate savings accounts, loans, insurance and the like. It’s becoming the hot area of fintech. Online-lending newcomer Upgrade as well as big old Citi pitched similar services at last week’s conference.","In recent months Marcus has also bought the assets of e-lender Bond Street and credit-card startup Final. Ismail calls these aqui-hires. He’s getting an impressive new employee with Clarity Money: Adam Dell, a serial entrepreneur and investor, whose brother Michael founded computing firm Dell. He joins Goldman as a partner. Marcus is also open to deals in everything from revolving credit to wealth management.","It’ll be a while yet until Marcus adds much to Goldman’s bottom line – perhaps $450 million in pre-tax profit by 2020, the investment bank projects, less than 4 percent of what analysts reckon Goldman will rake in overall. For now, though, the upstart division is providing a breath of fresh air."
