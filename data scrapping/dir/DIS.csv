Its P/E fell to a 52-week low of 14 on March 23 after beginning the year near 22.","Much of the gains in valuation have come from renewed investor attention to Disney Plus, which has attracted more than 50 million subscribers since launching in November.

They project that earnings before interest and taxes in the parks division will fall by approximately $500 million in this fiscal year and $200 million the next, compared with a $6.8 billion gain in fiscal 2019.","Bill Smead, chief investment officer at Smead Funds, said his firm has been reducing its position in Disney because the shares look over-valued at a time when its parks division will be limited and its ESPN and ABC segments are suffering from severe cutbacks in professional sports.","“A lot of the benefit you’d get from the return to full speed of parks and the return to full speed to professional sports is going to get ruined by a P/E contraction” once investor euphoria over the launch of its streaming business wears off, Smead said. “The next 10 years are spectacularly in their favor in terms of demographics, but the expansion of the earnings ratio at the same time that COVID is crushing a significant part of their business doesn’t make sense.”","Chris Marangi, a portfolio manager of Gabelli Funds, said investors are likely waiting for a larger margin of safety before taking bigger positions in the company, given its high valuation. Its parks division will likely not return to more normalized levels of revenue until at least 2022, he said, giving the company a short-term hit to earnings but building up longer-term demand once a vaccine relieves Disney of instituting capacity caps.","Disney has reopened its Shanghai and Hong Kong Disneyland parks, and on June 24 announced it was delaying a reopening of the original Disneyland in Anaheim, California indefinitely. The company’s Tokyo parks opened July 1.","“As we look out, Disney is the best-positioned media company for the next decade given their franchises and the success of Disney Plus in particular, but the near-term is going to be challenged,” Marangi said."

Either there are no available stocks to borrow, or it takes too long,” said Yuan, who runs a global macro fund for Olympus Hedge Fund Investments.","Short sellers sell borrowed shares in the hope of buying them back when prices fall and pocketing the difference. Those such as Carson Block of Muddy Waters and Dan David of Wolfpack Research have made their name shorting Chinese stocks but, like Yuan, their bets have been against stocks in New York or Hong Kong, not Shanghai or Shenzhen.","This could be about to change. Last Friday, regulators relaxed short-selling rules for Shenzhen’s $1 trillion (805 billion pounds) startup board, ChiNext, for domestic market participants. They are also considering letting foreigners borrow or lend mainland stocks to short.",Such reform could increase competitiveness and bring China’s markets a step closer to more robust capital-raising centres such as New York and Tokyo.,"Shares loaned for shorting in Shanghai and Shenzhen as of June 16 totalled $3.96 billion versus a stock market capitalisation of $8.9 trillion - a ratio of 0.044%, official data showed.","While markets do not calculate short data in exactly the same way, figures from IHS Markit show short interest in the United States of $780 billion, or 2.4% of market cap, and 1.5% for Tokyo.","Due to reform, however, Broker TF Securities estimates short selling in China is likely to grow 10-fold this year and double next year.",Others point to myriad hurdles - both operational and cultural.,"“In the short term, many obstacles are insurmountable,” said Wang Li, chief executive of hedge fund Full Harvest and former BlackRock money manager. “Little has changed after so many years, so I’m a bit disillusioned.”","Friday’s changes mark a major shift since 2015, when regulators blamed “malicious” short sellers for illegally “manipulating” the futures market and triggering a crash.","Keen to attract international money, regulators said they are more receptive to shorting as a hedging tool used by long-term investors and as a means of profiting by betting against stocks deemed over-valued.",Regulators also hope it could act as a stabilising force if short sellers’ bearish views help limit speculative bubbles.,"Their ChiNext changes, likely effective from August, are part of reforms to the board’s listing system.","Under these reforms, a wider group of domestic participants, including strategic investors, mutual fund managers, pension funds and insurers, will be allowed to lend stock.","Investors will also be able to short stock as soon as it debuts, compared with the main board’s three-month lag.","While borrowers and lenders must still conduct transactions through China Securities Finance (CSF), both will be given greater scope to negotiate deal terms.",The next development participants are watching for is allowing foreigners to short - and lend - mainland shares.,"“I’m optimistic that we can see more progress this year,” said Lyndon Chao, head of equities and post trade at ASIFMA, which represents global asset managers and brokers in Asia, and regularly discusses market issues with mainland officials.",Foreigners seeking to hedge mainland exposure - which elsewhere would typically involve stock shorting - can currently only short index futures.,"While reform is welcomed, participants said implementation may not be straightforward. One problem is finding shares to borrow.","“Many Chinese institutions trade frequently for quick profit making them unlikely lenders,” said Full Harvest’s Wang.","Another issue is the cost of a centralised system, designed to ensure government oversight.","“When you have CSF as a middleman, you add friction. They also charge you another two percentage points,” said Fang Ming, vice general manager of hedge fund house MingShi Investment.","Fang and others said allowing participants to set their own terms will help, but not solve, issues created by having an intermediary.","The cost of borrowing mainland-listed stock is more than 8% annually of its value, versus 0.9% to 1.2% in Hong Kong, according to brokerage data and people familiar with the markets.","The reforms come as support for short sellers publicly calling out potential problem companies has grown following a series of accounting scandals, such as that involving Luckin Coffee Inc LK.O, the U.S.-listed Chinese coffee chain that in April said executives falsified last year's sales.",Luckin’s sales growth had been questioned two months previously in an anonymous report publicised by Muddy Waters.,Olympus’ Yuan said a more open short-selling mechanism can help root out problem companies.,"“You need short sellers to shoot them down and kick them out. Otherwise, they harm investors.”","Chinese regulators have vowed “zero tolerance” toward listed company fraud. The ultimate test for their newfound acceptance of shorting will be whether they let short sellers fire those shots, rather than punishing them as in 2015.","“I could write articles criticising some listed companies, but I need to be very cautious, and the wording has to be gentle,” Xin Chen, professor at the Shanghai Advanced Institute of Finance, told venture capitalists in a recent video seminar.","Wolfpack’s David put it more simply: “Without some form of freedom of speech, short selling cannot exist.”"

TikTok has hinted at ambitions to build a music streaming business, announcing in January that it was partnering with U.K.-based music rights agency Merlin to expand its musical selections.","ByteDance’s Chinese ownership, however, has sparked concerns in Washington about TikTok’s handling of personal data. The company uses sophisticated artificial intelligence to make video recommendations based on users’ behavior on the app.","In November, the U.S. government launched a national security review of ByteDance’s $1 billion acquisition of social media app Musical.ly, which became TikTok. Two senators introduced a bill to ban federal employees from using TikTok on government-issued phones.","One of those senators, Republican Josh Hawley, said TikTok previously told him its executives could not testify before Congress because they were located in China.","“But this new executive lives in the USA,” Hawley wrote on Twitter on Monday. “I look forward to hearing from him.

Among other plans under consideration, according to a source briefed on Disney’s thinking: Rides like the Space Mountain roller coaster could stagger guests in each “rocket” to enforce social distancing. Guests could be notified via app or another technology when they can go on a ride or in a restaurant to eliminate lines.","Staffers, known as cast members, and guests could be required to wear masks. But in true Disney fashion, employees’ masks would be fun, not scary, the source said.","Disney on Thursday began online sales of face masks featuring Mickey Mouse, Baby Yoda and other characters and said up to $1 million in profits would go to charity.","Masks, now worn commonly across China, are ubiquitous in the shopping district outside Shanghai Disney, where workers disinfect a playground for 5- to 12-year-olds at noon and 3 p.m. daily.

Guidelines will be set by governors in California and Florida, where Iger and Walt Disney World Resort President Josh D’Amaro sit on state reopening task forces. The rest is up to Disney.","Although Disney and other large venues face an unprecedented challenge protecting guests from an easily spread airborne virus, experts and a former executive pointed to its experience handling crowds.","More than 157 million people visited Disney parks in 2018, according to the Themed Entertainment Association.","“If anybody can figure it out, Disney will,” said Dave Schmitt, founder of MR-ProFun, a consultant to theme parks.","Safeguards have limits. Temperature checks will not catch everyone infected, and most vaccines are not 100% effective, said Dr. Megan Murray, a global health professor at Harvard Medical School.","Even so, a vaccine would provide some reassurance for park-goers, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll conducted from April 15-21. While a fifth of respondents said they would attend an amusement, theme or water park whenever they reopen, about 30% would go if a vaccine was available. The poll, which surveyed 4,429 American adults, noted that a vaccine might not be available for more than a year.","Loyal fans are counting on Disney to get this right. Chicago resident Kelly Alexis, 50, has been to Disney resorts 35 to 40 times and plans to go to Disney World with her family in October if the park is open.","“It’s just the feeling that they do things so perfectly and they will take every precaution,” Alexis said. “They’re not going to want to have an epidemic where everyone gets sick at Disney.

The vote is advisory and non-binding.","About 82% of total shares outstanding were represented by the vote, the company said.","Disney has previously faced criticism over former Chief Executive Bob Iger’s pay, which was $65.6 million in the company’s 2018 fiscal year, up 80% from the previous year. At its 2017 annual meeting, Disney suffered a rare rebuke when a majority of shareholders opposed its executive pay in a non-binding vote.",Disney announced Iger stepped down on Feb. 25 but remains at the company as executive chairman.

That plan set Iger’s 2019 compensation at $47.5 million, according to a Jan. 17, 2020 filing.","But Julian Hamud, senior director at proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis, said via email that “Both transitions are quite expensive, and it was not lost on us that Mr. Chapek’s employment agreement explicitly states that he reports to the executive chairman.”","Glass Lewis advised shareholders to oppose the 2019 executive pay plan in a non-binding vote, as did other proxy advisers Institutional Shareholder Services and Egan-Jones.","In Disney’s current proxy statement, the company acknowledged the pushback on executive pay, stating that during the fiscal year 2019, members of management and the board spoke with 11 of the company’s top 20 shareholders and contacted approximately 74% of its largest 50 investors, “seeking input on compensation and governance matters.” Based on that feedback, Iger agreed to reduce his compensation on three different occasions.","In his new role as chairman, Iger’s employment agreement will continue unchanged. So until he retires at the end of 2021, Disney will be paying for both Iger and Chapek, whose compensation is set at a minimum of $25 million annually.","The Florida State Board of Administration, which manages pension assets for Florida state and local employees and had 2.3 million shares of Disney as of the end of 2019, voted against the compensation plan this year. “It seems to be maximized for payout without sufficient ties to the performance levels,” said Jacob Williams, corporate governance manager with the organization.","In a March 5 filing, Disney defended the plan, writing that “Iger’s compensation in fiscal 2019 reflected the considerable value he generated for the company and its shareholders, with the completion of the acquisition of Twenty-First Century Fox and implementation of the company’s transformative direct-to-consumer strategy, culminating in the successful launch of Disney+.","More than 90% of Iger’s compensation is performance-based, and under his leadership since 2005, Disney has delivered total shareholder return of 559%, compared with just 223% for the S&P 500 as of fiscal year-end 2019.”","Disney said that 92% of shareholders who cast their vote at the annual meeting had voted to elect all nine members of the board of directors.

AMC Networks includes the BBC America and IFC channels.","A benefit to partnering on Xandr Invest is the tool allows AMC to control the pricing of its ads and whom it works with, said Evan Adlman, senior vice president of advanced advertising and digital partnerships at AMC.","While Xandr Invest serves as the technology to buy ads and target audiences across the partners, the networks themselves will retain control in selling the ad space, said Mike Welch, executive vice president of product and business development at Xandr.","The new TV ad buying capabilities are meant to round out Xandr’s appeal to advertisers, which historically had a focus on internet display ads, Welch added.","The new version of Xandr Invest launches just ahead of the upfront season in May, a critical annual advertising sales period where brands preview the upcoming TV season and buy commercials in advance."

Chapek also needs to keep the Disney+ streaming service competitive as new rivals launch this year.","Former CEO Bob Iger, who stepped down from that post on Feb. 25 but remains at the company as executive chairman, will focus on content creation until he retires at the end of 2021.","At the meeting in Raleigh, N.C., shareholders will not officially vote on Chapek’s compensation - only on a pay plan for named executives, which do not include him, in fiscal year 2019 which ended Sept. 28. That plan set Iger’s 2019 compensation at $47.5 million, according to a Jan. 17, 2020 filing.","But Julian Hamud, senior director at proxy advisory firm Glass Lewis, said via e-mail that the vote “will be a bit of a blurred line covering both Mr. Chapek’s new package and the pay for Mr. Iger’s shift to executive chairman. Both transitions are quite expensive, and it was not lost on us that Mr. Chapek’s employment agreement explicitly states that he reports to the executive chairman.”","Glass Lewis advised shareholders to oppose the 2019 executive pay plan in a non-binding vote, as did other proxy advisers Institutional Shareholder Services and Egan-Jones. “Specifically, the CEO’s base salary is more than double that of company peers at $3 million,” ISS wrote in its own report.","Disney has previously faced criticism over Iger’s pay, which was $65.6 million in the company’s 2018 fiscal year, up 80% from the previous year. At its 2017 annual meeting, Disney suffered a rare rebuke when a majority of shareholders opposed its executive pay in a non-binding vote.","In the current proxy statement, the company acknowledged the pushback, stating that during the fiscal year 2019, members of management and the board spoke with 11 of the company’s top 20 shareholders and contacted approximately 74% of its largest 50 investors, “seeking input on compensation and governance matters.” Based on that feedback, Iger agreed to reduce his compensation on three different occasions.","In his new role as chairman, Iger’s employment agreement will continue unchanged. So until he retires at the end of 2021, Disney will be paying for both Iger and Chapek, whose compensation is set at a minimum of $25 million annually.","The Florida State Board of Administration, which manages pension assets for Florida state and other local authority employees and had 2.3 million shares of Disney as of the end of 2019, voted against the compensation plan this year. “It seems to be maximized for payout without sufficient ties to the performance levels,” said Jacob Williams, corporate governance manager with the organization.","In a March 5 filing, Disney defended the plan, writing that “Iger’s compensation in fiscal 2019 reflected the considerable value he generated for the company and its shareholders, with the completion of the acquisition of Twenty-First Century Fox and implementation of the company’s transformative direct-to-consumer strategy, culminating in the successful launch of Disney+.","More than 90% of Iger’s compensation is performance-based, and under his leadership since 2005, Disney has delivered total shareholder return of 559%, compared to just 223% for the S&P 500 as of fiscal year-end 2019.” (Reporting by Helen Coster in New York; additional reporting by Ross Kerber in Boston; Editing by Cynthia Osterman)"

The dynamic between the two will be more like a COO/CEO relationship than CEO and chairman, according to former colleagues.","“Chapek is a decent option for complementing the things that Iger doesn’t want to do,” said a former colleague. “Disney keeps him doing the stuff he does want to do and lets Chapek worry about the trains running on time.”","Over the next 22 months, Chapek can rely on Iger’s creative instincts to navigate big decisions in the content world, such as whether the company’s new streaming service, Disney+, needs more original programming, while Chapek focuses on crises like managing the coronavirus fallout, which could include a material impact on Disney’s parks, cruises and film business.","Less certain is Chapek's ability to take bold steps in new directions, such as Iger's $71 billion gamble that by buying 21st Century Fox, Disney could build a subscription video streaming service to compete against Netflix NFLX.O.","That bet led to Disney+, which is viewed as an early success with close to 30 million sign-ups. Maintaining that momentum will be harder as Disney faces new rivals such as AT&T Inc's T.N HBO Max, which is why the media and Wall Street largely expected Kevin Mayer, chairman of Direct to Consumer and International who oversees Disney+, to succeed Iger.","But Mayer, who has been at the company since 1993, had a relatively short time in an operating role compared to Chapek.","The big question for Disney, said one former colleague, is what happens when Iger leaves the company. “That’s when the rubber hits the road.”"

(Reuters) - AT&T Inc T.N in May will launch its HBO Max streaming service with a new ""Game of Thrones"" series at the current HBO price of $15 a month in an aggressive move to battle Netflix, Disney and Apple for the future of TV.","The price, which many expected to be higher, surprised the financial analysts and investors attending the WarnerMedia presentation on Tuesday.","HBO Max is expected to reach 75 million to 90 million global subscribers by 2025, with about 50 million of these coming from the United States. The new service is expected to generate about $5 billion in U.S. revenue by 2025.","The stakes are high for AT&T, which is saddled with debt from a $134 billion acquisition spree to combine media conglomerate Time Warner and satellite TV provider DirecTV with the second-largest U.S. wireless phone company by subscribers.",The success of HBO Max is in many ways a referendum on a strategy to merge content with the means to distribute it.,"HBO, which invented high-end, subscription programming, is playing catch-up in the streaming era dominated by Netflix.","To compete, AT&T has committed to invest up to $4 billion in additional HBO Max content by 2025, executives said, just a day after reporting tepid media results for the third quarter.","The investment falls far short of its biggest rival Netflix Inc NFLX.O, which has earmarked $15 billion in cash on content spending in 2019. But AT&T and WarnerMedia executives believe they have content and ways to get it in front of consumers that are lacking at Apple Inc AAPL.O, Walt Disney Co DIS.N and Amazon.com AMZN.O.","WarnerMedia Chief Executive John Stankey this month told Reuters that HBO Max will be available this spring to 10 million current AT&T customers in the United States -- a mix of wireless, satellite TV, and some HBO Now subscribers -- at no extra charge.","“The price point of $14.99 for HBO Max strikes a good balance between not cannibalizing HBO’s existing revenue base, while also addressing the competitive environment in streaming television,” said Sam Hendel, president of Levin Easterly Partners and a portfolio manager at the firm, which owns about 3.5 million shares of AT&T. “The HBO Max content offering is extremely robust and I think it will be well received by investors and consumers.”","From Stage 21 on the Warner Brothers Studio lot in Burbank, California, executives demonstrated the breadth of new original programming and the depth of WarnerMedia’s extensive library of films and TV series. They included the entire collection of DC Universe superhero film franchises from the last decade such as “Batman” and recent box office hits such as “Joker” that will be available within the first year of its launch. WarnerMedia also secured the U.S. streaming rights to “South Park.”","To court new viewers, WarnerMedia executives said they will introduce 88 original series in 2021, 38 from HBO and 50 under the category it called “Max Originals” that will target younger audiences.","Executives announced a batch of new shows from high-profile producers and directors including “Raised by Wolves” by “Alien” filmmaker Ridley Scott about androids raising human children and “College Girls” from comedian, actress and writer Mindy Kaling.","Ahead of the presentation, HBO canceled a much-anticipated prequel to the “Game of Thrones” starring Naomi Watts, one source familiar with the matter said, confirming reports in Hollywood media.","Instead, WarnerMedia executives announced 10 episodes of a new “Game of Thrones” prequel called “House of Dragons.” The series will be set 300 years before the events of the just-concluded series and is based on author George R.R. Martin’s book “Fire & Blood.”","Although the Warner Brothers library includes popular content like “The Shining” and “Scooby-Doo” -- and the HBO brand is known for edgy, high-quality programming -- it does not have the same brand awareness as Pixar, Marvel or Disney properties that will be included in the Disney+ streaming service that launches Nov. 12.","And as one of the latest entries in the streaming wars, HBO Max will be competing for household dollars that may have already been allocated to rivals.","WarnerMedia is hoping that with HBO Max, it can continue serving HBO’s core over-40 audience, and expand to include younger viewers who may prefer to stream content and do not want to pay for cable.","“This is not Netflix. This is not Disney. This is uniquely HBO Max,” AT&T Chief Executive Randall Stephenson said."

Disney boasts a deep library of Marvel’s superhero hits, the Star Wars universe, “Toy Story” creator Pixar animation and the National Geographic channel.","Disney+ has a budget of over $1 billion for original content - a figure that will grow to around $2 billion by 2024. It is priced higher than Apple TV+, at $7 monthly or $70 annually. A bundle that includes ESPN+ and Hulu will cost $13 per month.","Media executives and analysts believe that most households are willing to pay for more than one streaming service. Many believe subscribers are unlikely to cancel their Netflix subscription to pay for other services to pay for Disney+, instead subscribing to both. IAC Chairman Barry Diller told CNBC in July that Disney has the best chance of catching up to Netflix “because of its very, very popular content.”","Apple will not directly compete with Amazon Inc’s Prime Video because that service is bundled with other perks of Prime membership - most significantly, free one- or two-day delivery on most Amazon orders.","Next spring, Apple will face another significant rival in television: HBO. AT&T-owned WarnerMedia’s forthcoming HBO Max, likely priced at $16 to $17 per month, has a library of HBO, Warner Bros and other content, and is investing in original content as well.","Apple, which is spending $2 billion on original content this year, is sitting on $210.6 billion in cash. “Apple has the firepower to outspend a company like Disney by a wide degree,” said media analyst Rich Greenfield. “If Apple makes great content, people will subscribe.”","For now, Apple TV+’s greatest advantage is its reach and its scale. With 1.4 billion devices worldwide, free service on most new device sales and a November launch in over 100 markets, it has the potential to do what no other service has done: be everywhere on Day One.

All those companies fall within the communication services sector.","Netflix’s stock has sunk 14% since it reported on July 17 that it unexpectedly lost U.S. subscribers in the second quarter, rattling investors already worried about the upcoming launch of Disney’s streaming service.","Disney’s family-friendly Disney+, set to launch on Nov. 12 with a slate of new and classic TV shows and movies, is viewed as the most dangerous threat to Netflix. Disney’s shares hit a record high on Monday and have surged 28% this year.","“There is an analysis that has been going on among investors, looking at the number of subscribers Netflix has and the growth that Disney’s service could put up in the next three or four years, and the huge disparity in the two companies’ valuations,” said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana.","The recent increase in Disney’s shares and decline in Netflix’s shows that investors expect Disney to significantly dent Netflix’s leadership in streaming, Carlson said.","Disney’s stock is trading at 22 times expected earnings, its highest forward earnings valuation since 2004, according to Refinitiv data. Netflix’s forward earnings valuation has dipped to 66 from 82 in early July, before its disappointing quarterly report.","Smaller players CBS and sister company Viacom have also built advertising-supported and subscription video services to compete with Netflix, and they are providing original content to other distributors.","Beyond streaming, investors watching Disney’s report on Tuesday will focus on its recent run of box office hits, including “The Lion King,” which has increased Disney’s lead position at the U.S. box office. Disney owns the five-highest grossing movies of 2019, led by “Avengers: Endgame” and “Captain Marvel.”","“The Netflix disappointment and the big Disney box office numbers underscore the importance of intellectual property, of ownership of content,” said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at Cresset Wealth Advisors in Chicago. Even though Netflix makes many of its own shows, it still relies on other producers, he said.","Netflix is losing its two most-watched shows in the United States - “Friends” and “The Office” - to upcoming rival services from AT&T Inc and NBC Universal in 2020 and 2021, respectively.","Viacom and CBS, both controlled by the Redstone family’s National Amusements Inc, have worked out a management structure that would see Viacom Chief Executive Officer Robert Bakish leading the combined company if a merger deal is reached, sources familiar with the matter said on Friday, removing a major roadblock in talks to recombine the corporations.","In addition to looking for potential confirmation of that deal when CBS and Viacom report their results on Thursday, investors will focus on growth in CBS’s All Access and Showtime streaming services.","Viacom could also give details about its strategy to sell programming to video streaming services, including its Paramount Television unit’s “Jack Ryan” TV series, based on the character created by author Tom Clancy, which premiered last year on Amazon Prime.","Long viewed as stodgy stocks for dividend-oriented investors, the telecom services sector was renamed communication services last September and supercharged with internet heavyweights Alphabet Inc, Facebook, Netflix and Twitter Inc, along with videogame makers. It was the biggest shakeup of the Global Industry Classification Standard, or GICS, since it was created in 1999. It has gained 5% since then, while the S&P 500 is unchanged over the same period.",CBS and Viacom have both gained about 15% in 2019.,"Helped by its $71 billion acquisition of 21st Century Fox’s assets, Disney is expected by analysts to report a 41% jump in fiscal third-quarter revenue to $21.5 billion, according to Refinitiv data. Analysts on average expect earnings per share of $1.75. Disney’s EPS has met or exceeded consensus estimates in six of the past eight quarters.","“My guess is the company will want to focus on content and investors will want to hear more about the streaming strategy,” Ablin said."

(Reuters) - Walt Disney Co Chief Executive Bob Iger told Reuters on Wednesday it would be “very difficult” for the media company to keep filming in Georgia if a new abortion law takes effect because many people will not want to work in the U.S. state.","Disney has filmed blockbuster movies in Georgia such as “Black Panther” and “Avengers: Endgame,” and it would be a blow to the state’s efforts to create production jobs if the entertainment giant stopped filming there.","Georgia’s Republican governor signed into law on May 7 a ban on abortion after a doctor can detect a fetal heartbeat - about six weeks into a pregnancy, before many women know they are pregnant.

The trend is up-ending the traditional licensing model where brands worked with apparel wholesalers to produce garments and get them into stores.,"The ‘Merch by Amazon’ on-demand printing service, in its third full year of operation, works by printing t-shirts once an order comes in, meaning content creators like video game makers and pay TV channels do not have to commit to a large merchandise inventory upfront.",This allows companies to offer t-shirts featuring niche characters that would not warrant a wide distribution.,"“You can list overnight on Amazon all the merchandise that’s for sale and then as you book sales you just make it and ship it,” said intellectual property lawyer Gaston Kroub. “It completely cuts out that whole traditional supply chain.”","The expanding service is another way in which Amazon is becoming a major player in the clothing industry. The company had a group of patents granted in recent years outlining a process to integrate fabric printing, cutting, sewing and dispatch to a customer in one computer-controlled process.","Bringing apparel manufacture back to the United States and Europe would eliminate the long production times and commitment to big orders inherent for Western apparel brands sourcing from countries like China, Vietnam and Indonesia.","When fabric cutting is delayed to the last possible moment and garments are produced on-demand, it can also prevent the pile-up of unsold inventory, allowing brands to sell more stock at full price.",Amazon told Reuters the ‘Merch by Amazon’ format allowed it to offer designs across 21 colors and 15 sizes without brands and content creators having to manage inventory.,"It said it was interested in all brand types from major entertainment brands to musicians, consumer products and social media influencers with a minimum of 100,000 followers.","Following an upheaval of consumer habits, which has led to the shuttering of thousands of small apparel stores, Amazon has overtaken Walmart Inc as the most-shopped clothing retailer in the United States and outpaced Marks and Spencer Group PLC in Britain, according to surveys.",Amazon has a try-before-you-buy service as well as many of its own private label clothing brands.,"Royalty revenue from sales of licensed merchandise and services globally amounted to $14.5 billion last year, up 2.6% from 2017, according to professional licensing association LIMA, with more than half of that coming from the U.S. and Canada.","Entertainment and character licensing was the biggest industry category, while apparel, toys and fashion was the biggest product category, a LIMA survey found.","Dr. Seuss Enterprises has increased sales through ‘Merch by Amazon’ by 40 percent since opening its store on the site around 18 months ago, selling t-shirts and hoodies emblazoned with characters like The Grinch and The Cat the Hat, president Susan Brandt told Reuters.","Dr. Seuss helps Amazon with design, but Amazon sources the clothing and handles the sales and distribution, a Dr. Seuss Enterprises spokeswoman said. Dr. Seuss also sells licensed products through stores like Target Corp and Walmart, she said.","Disney, which started printing t-shirts on-demand through Amazon in December 2016, has increased orders and expanded offerings from all its franchises since then, including Disney, Star Wars, Pixar and Marvel, a company spokeswoman said.","Disney also uses traditional licensing models to manufacture and sell products, the spokeswoman said.","Pay TV channel Cartoon Network, which started working with ‘Merch by Amazon’ in 2016, has added designs and increased profits via the service since then, a company spokeswoman said.","The brand prints with other vendors, but the on-demand service allows it to give frequent design updates and offer secondary characters that may not be available in traditional stores, she said.","“The profit-sharing on-demand model existed before Amazon started their effort, but the size that they are, they have created a tidal wave,” said Gabi Seligsohn, former CEO and current board member of Kornit Digital Ltd, the Israeli company that provides textile printers for ‘Merch by Amazon’.","The business is growing.

Intellectual property lawyers say this shows where companies think the technology is going.","“There is no doubt that patenting activity is indicative of some kind of market trend,” said John Lanza, Boston-based intellectual property lawyer at Foley & Lardner LLP. “On-demand apparel manufacture is very hot.”","In 2017, Amazon Technologies was granted a U.S. patent for on-demand apparel manufacturing whereby a textile printer, textile cutter and computing device are linked up to cut out garment patterns and align them for sewing in response to electronic orders.","Amazon Technologies has been granted other patents linked to on-demand apparel manufacture since then, including continuous feed fabric cutting using lasers and a robotic system that uses fluorescent ink as a guide for cutting fabric.","Amazon, a prolific patent generator and one of the United States’ top patent holders, declined to say whether it had put any of the patents into production.

Tim Burton’s live-action remake debuted with $45 million from 4,259 North American theaters, below expectations heading into the weekend.","While that was easily enough to top the domestic box office, it marks the lowest start among the studio’s recent live-action remakes of Disney classics. To compare, 2017’s “Beauty and the Beast” debuted with $174 million, 2016’s “The Jungle Book” opened with $103 million,” and 2015’s “Cinderella” launched with $67 million.","Heading into the weekend, “Dumbo” was expected to surpass $50 million in its first three days of release. Part of the reason for the softer opening is likely because the original “Dumbo” cartoon came out 80 years ago, making the lovable elephant seem slightly less relevant than classics like “Beauty and the Beast” and “The Jungle Book,” which both became huge successes for the studio.","“Dumbo” carries a $170 million production budget. The high-flying elephant will have to resonate overseas should “Dumbo” not pick up steam at the domestic box office. The movie launched in most international territories this weekend, amassing $71 million from foreign markets for a global start of $116 million.","Audiences were more receptive than critics to Tim Burton’s take on baby elephant with inconveniently large ears. Moviegoers awarded “Dumbo” with an A- Cinemascore. It holds a 50 percent on Rotten Tomatoes. As expected, families made up 54 percent of opening weekend crowds. It also skewed slightly female: 53 percent of patrons were women.","“Dumbo” is the first of three high-profile Disney re-imaginings heading back to the big screen this year, with Guy Richie’s “Aladdin” and Jon Favreau’s “The Lion King” arriving in theaters this summer. Those films, along with the studio’s highly anticipated superhero mashup “Avengers: Endgame,” will likely offset any pain should “Dumbo” fail to connect with audiences.","Last weekend’s champ “Us” dropped to second place, staying strong with $33 million in its sophomore outing. That marks a 53% decline from its opening weekend haul, a solid hold given the kind of drop horror movies typically suffer after its initial release. Written and directed by Jordan Peele, “Us” has now surpassed $128 million in ticket sales in North America. The film, which stars Lupita Nyong’o and Winston Duke as a couple forced to fight off blood-thirsty doppelgangers, cost $20 million to produce.","In third place, Disney’s “Captain Marvel” added another $20 million in its third weekend of release. That takes the superhero tentpole starring Brie Larson past $350 million in North America.",New release “Unplanned” will battle with romance drama “Five Feet Apart” for fourth place. Both titles earned roughly $6 million this weekend.,"“Unplanned,” which tells the true story of a Planned Parenthood employee who has a life-changing experience, doubled expectations that pegged an opening weekend around $3 million. It cost $6 million to produce.","Lionsgate and CBS Films’ “Five Feet Apart,” now in its third weekend of release, has earned $35 million to date.","Elsewhere, Matthew McConaughey suffered the worst opening of his career with “The Beach Bum.” Directed by Harmony Korine, the film flopped with $1.8 million from 1,100 screens. The studios initially planned for a platform release, which could have slowly allowed the film to gain traction through word-of-mouth. Instead, the stoner comedy opened nationwide with little marketing since its premiere at South by Southwest. It’s been a rocky start to 2019 for McConaughey. Earlier this year, his film “Serenity,” a neo-noir thriller with Anne Hathaway, collapsed with a $4.5 million debut. It tapped out with $11.4 million worldwide."

The new streaming services include Disney+ and ESPN+.","By saving content for its own platforms, Disney estimates a decrease in year-over-year operating income of $150 million this fiscal year because it will forego licensing revenue from others, Chief Financial Officer Christine McCarthy said on a conference call.","For the fiscal first quarter that ended in December, Disney reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.84. Analysts on average had expected $1.55, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.","Disney has reorganized its divisions for its streaming future, and Tuesday’s earnings report was the first to reflect the company’s new structure.","Operating income at the media networks unit, Disney’s largest, rose 7 percent from a year earlier to $1.3 billion. The ABC broadcast division saw profit jump 40 percent thanks to growth in affiliate fees, advertising revenue and program sales.","The theme parks and consumer products division reported profit of $2.2 billion, up 10 percent from a year earlier. Results were buoyed by increased guest spending and higher occupancy rates at Disney’s U.S. theme parks.","“Disney’s earnings momentum shows that the company will be entering a highly competitive video-streaming market from a position of strength,” said Haris Anwar, senior analyst at Investing.com.","“If its existing media assets are churning out good cash and it’s able to contain its costs, the video streaming push later this year should make investors excited and help the stock to get out of its current sluggish spell,” he said.","The ESPN+ streaming service has signed up 2 million paying subscribers, Disney’s chief executive, Bob Iger, said on the conference call. That is double the number five months ago. Nearly 600,000 of those new customers joined ahead of the service’s first UFC Fight Night mixed-martial arts contest, Iger said.","Overall, Disney’s adjusted earnings-per-share declined 3 percent for the quarter from a year earlier as profit fell at the company’s movie studio.","Profit at the movie studio plunged 63 percent to $309 million as films including “Mary Poppins Returns” could not match the strong lineup of a year earlier, which included “Star Wars: The Last Jedi.”","A new division, direct-to-consumer and international, reported a $136 million loss for the quarter. That included spending to set up Disney+, a streaming service for family entertainment that the company plans to debut later this year.","As part of that effort, Disney will withhold programming such as upcoming movie “Captain Marvel” from Netflix.","Disney also is in the process of buying film and TV assets from 21st Century Fox Inc to expand its portfolio. That deal will give Disney a majority stake in Hulu, which the company aims to offer alongside Disney+ and ESPN+.",Iger said it is possible Disney may offer discounts to people who buy more than one of the three streaming services.

Shares in the pay-TV group are down 2 percent since suitor Comcast last week said it wouldn’t challenge Walt Disney’s bid for most of Twenty-First Century Fox. Yet the Mickey Mouse owner could still prove a nuisance to Comcast in the battle for Sky, to investors’ gain.","Sky’s falling share price suggests investors think that Comcast’s defeat will also defuse the battle for the UK group. After losing out to Disney’s $71 billion bid for Fox assets, including its 39 percent Sky stake, Comcast boss Brian Roberts said he’ll instead focus on buying Sky, for which he is competing with Fox. For Roberts to get full control, he will need Fox to sell its stake. That might suit Disney, as it would help fund the larger deal.","But a truce may not be in Disney’s interest. Boss Bob Iger called Sky the “crown jewel” of Rupert Murdoch’s Fox empire. That’s because he could use its technology and streaming service to channel Disney’s TV shows and movies directly to consumers. Sky, which reaches 120 million people, is the only way Disney can gain scale in Europe.","Iger has already shown he is happy to pay up. When Fox raised its offer to 14 pounds per share, Disney agreed to reimburse the difference above 13 pounds in case the wider tie-up fails. Stretching to 15 pounds per share, enough to trump Comcast’s latest offer, would cost an extra $1.4 billion – small in the context of the bigger Fox deal.","Iger and Murdoch have an advantage over Roberts. Disney’s acquisition of Fox assets includes the 39 percent stake in Sky, so the cost of a raise would only apply to the 61 percent it doesn’t own. That means any price increase does more damage to Comcast than Disney. And Iger has little reason to let Comcast win easily, since Roberts has plenty of firepower that’s now concentrated only on Sky.","Investors are not betting on a big raise. Sky’s share price is 15.08 pounds, just 2 percent above Comcast’s latest offer. Second-guessing Iger is risky. He might just let Comcast buy out other Sky investors, and then hold out for a better price. Still, there’s a good chance that Sky’s takeover war gets even more heated."

However, it still leaves the two companies competing to expand in Europe via a bidding war for Sky, which is 39-percent owned by Fox.","Fox has also made an offer for the 61 percent of Sky it does not own, although Comcast is currently the highest bidder with a 14.75 pounds-per share-offer, worth $34 billion, for the London-listed pay TV group.","Shares of Comcast, the largest U.S. cable company, rose 2.7 percent as investors were relieved the company did not try to outbid Disney further. Disney shares were up 1.6 percent.","Fox shares fell 1.2 percent and Sky ended down 1.5 percent. One of the reasons Comcast dropped its bid for the Fox assets was that the bidding war was inflating the value of Sky, given its partial ownership by Fox, according to sources familiar with the company’s thinking.","“Walking away from the battle for Fox at this price we think supports the view that (Comcast is) fine without it,” said Jonathan Chaplin, analyst at New Street Research. “It remains to be seen how Sky wraps up, but we think it is highly unlikely that they would bid up to a price that would suggest desperation.”","In a regulatory filing last week, Fox and Disney acknowledged for the first time they may not try to again outbid Comcast on Sky, though the sources stressed no decision has been taken.","Bernstein analysts have said Disney’s debt pile could now hamper its ability to take on Comcast with a new bid for Sky, partly because it will need to invest even more to launch a successful direct-to-consumer streaming platform.","Disney and Fox did not immediately reply to requests for comment. On CNBC, Disney’s Iger said he was “extremely pleased with today’s news.” Fox and Disney shareholders will vote on their deal next week.","Comcast dropped its bid for the Fox assets because it was concerned the price was becoming too high, even though its banks were ready to finance a new bid, according to the sources. It was also worried how much revenue it would lose in divesting assets to appease U.S. antitrust regulators.","“I’d like to congratulate Bob Iger and the team at Disney and commend the Murdoch family and Fox for creating such a desirable and respected company,” Comcast’s Roberts said in a statement on Thursday.","Disney owns ABC, ESPN, Pixar, Marvel Studios and “Star Wars” producer Lucasfilm, plus an array of theme parks. The Fox assets being acquired include a cable group with FX Networks, National Geographic and 300-plus international channels, plus Fox’s stake in Hulu.","Immediately before the acquisition by Disney, Fox will separate the Fox Broadcasting network and stations, Fox News Channel, Fox Business Network, its sports channels FS1, FS2 and the Big Ten Network, into a newly-listed company that it will spin off to shareholders.",The bidding between Comcast and Disney is part of a bigger battle in the entertainment industry as media giants splash out tens of billions of dollars on deals to be able to compete with Netflix Inc NFLX.O and Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O.,"While an acquisition of Britain’s Sky, a broadcaster of sports, films and TV shows to 23 million homes across Europe, would significantly diversify Comcast’s business overseas, it would do little to give it scale in its core U.S. market.","“Our view is that probably there is less chance of Fox/Disney coming back with an increased offer for Sky given that Comcast would have more available firepower,” said Liberum analyst Ian Whittaker.","Nevertheless, Sky shares ended trading at 15.09 pounds on Thursday, above Comcast’s 14.75-pound-per-share offer, as investors continued to bet on a better deal. “I don’t think Disney wants to give up Sky,” said Crispin Odey, whose eponymous hedge fund owns Sky shares.","Comcast was drawn into a bidding war for Fox because of the scarcity of big media assets up for sale, given that the industry is dominated by powerful families and personalities reluctant to cede control. CBS Corp CBS.N and Viacom Inc VIAB.O, for example, are tightly controlled by the Redstone family.","However, smaller media companies could become acquisition targets. Lions Gate Entertainment Corp LGFa.N rose 5.2 percent on investor speculation it could become an acquisition target. Sony Pictures Entertainment Inc and MGM Studios Inc are also seen as potential targets.","Comcast first made an offer for the Fox entertainment assets last November, but Fox decided to go with Disney, even if its bid was lower, because it believed a deal with Comcast would not win antitrust approval.

The controlling owner of the U.S. cable firm decided not to top rival Walt Disney’s $71 billion bid for some assets of Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox. He also backed down from an aggressive tilt at the Mouse House 14 years earlier. Given the eye-watering price Disney is paying, Roberts and his shareholders should come out the winners.","Instead, Comcast will focus across the Atlantic and attempt to win a bidding fight with Fox for pay-TV outfit Sky, for which Roberts has so far bid around $34 billion.","Disney CEO Bob Iger initially agreed in December to pay Fox shareholders $52.4 billion in stock for the media assets on offer. Comcast came back in June with a $65 billion all-cash bid just as the U.S. Department of Justice lost its case against AT&T’s merger with Time Warner. Disney countered with the current price, and Fox shareholders are due to vote on the transaction next week.","In short, Roberts has forced Iger to pay more than 35 percent over his original offer and pushed the leverage-shy Disney boss into new territory: Breakingviews calculates that after the deal closes, Disney’s debt will rise to more than three times EBITDA even if Fox doesn’t first buy the 61 percent of Sky it doesn’t own.","Aside from the balance sheet, Iger must also successfully integrate the sometimes rough-edged Fox properties with Disney’s pristine and family-friendly brand. Iger has succeeded with prior acquisitions Pixar, Marvel and Lucasfilm, but Fox is on a larger scale and the deal comes at much more perilous time for traditional media firms under assault from the likes of Netflix.","Roberts’ hostile lunge at Disney in 2004, aiming to capitalize on his target’s weakness at the time, met resistance and shareholder doubt. He was smart to walk away. Since the start of 2008, Comcast’s annual total return to shareholders has been a notch or two higher than Disney’s.

However, the Justice Department's decision last week to appeal against the loss of its challenge to AT&T Inc's T.N takeover of Time Warner Inc served as a reminder that risks persist of antitrust measures.",Walking away from the main Fox assets would give Comcast less negotiating leverage with Disney and Fox to end the bidding war for Sky.

Yet one number just gets smaller: the return on investment for whoever wins.,"Disney and Comcast’s dueling bids – and the parallel fight between Fox and Comcast over European pay-TV group Sky, in which Fox owns 39 percent – are being fueled by strategic necessity, ego and a devil-may-care approach to financial logic. Disney’s last offer of $71.3 billion for Fox’s entertainment and international assets is more than a third higher than what it initially agreed to pay last year.","The next step may be that Comcast Chief Executive Brian Roberts raises his offer too. He sweetened his bid for Sky by 18 percent on Wednesday. But Roberts starts on the back foot with Fox. The U.S. Department of Justice on June 27 approved Disney’s transaction so long as it sells Fox’s cluster of regional sports networks, which means the Mouse House can argue its bid is already close to being deliverable.","While the price escalates, what the bidders get stays the same. The Fox assets up for sale could contribute about $5.3 billion of operating profit in 2020, taking Fox’s own estimates and deducting depreciation equivalent to around 2 percent of revenue. Fox’s stake in Sky adds another $1 billion or so.","Then there are synergies, of which Disney is targeting $2 billion annually. Comcast reckons it can cut about the same, aside from any benefits if it snags Sky. Take the sum total of $8.3 billion and tax it at 21 percent, and whoever wins Fox will make back about $6.6 billion a year on their investment.","When Disney boss Bob Iger first offered $52.4 billion plus the assumption of $13.7 billion of debt, that would have meant a return of about 10 percent – higher than Fox’s cost of capital of around 8 percent. Now it’s just under that threshold. If Comcast ups the ante with a higher bid, the return will fall further, destroying value.","Iger and Roberts are both savvy acquirers and have deftly integrated past deals. But whoever loses out will have avoided a heap of integration risk, a mass of debt, and an investment that doesn’t wash its face – while leaving their rival saddled with all three."

The Mickey Mouse owner last year agreed to pay Murdoch’s group $28 per share in stock for assets including its 39 percent interest in Sky. Fox had already offered to buy the rest of the pay-TV group, and the panel said Disney had to extend the same offer to Sky’s shareholders should Murdoch’s bid fail. Further complicating matters, cable group Comcast has launched competing bids for Fox and Sky. That prompted Disney to hit back with a $38 per share bid for Fox, 36 percent above its previous offer.","Unsurprisingly, hedge funds invested in Sky argue that Disney owes them the same 36 percent bump. If so, that would incentivise shareholders in Sky to hold out until Disney takes over Fox and is forced to launch a sweetened buyout. Apply Disney’s Fox bump to Sky, and those hedge funds would be entitled to 14.59 pounds per share - higher than Comcast’s 12.50 pound offer and Fox’s original 10.75 pounds.","That would make sense. Without a bump for Sky minorities, Murdoch’s group effectively gets a better price for its slice than the pay-TV group’s other shareholders - a no-no for Takeover Panel principles. Disney could attempt to justify this by arguing that its new, higher Fox bid relates to the U.S. assets rather than Sky. But that’s hard to square with a recent filing, where the Mickey Mouse owner raised its Sky EBITDA forecasts by around a quarter for 2020 and 2021 to reflect lower soccer costs.","Unless the Takeover Panel wants to hand Murdoch a seemingly unfair victory, it’ll have to put a floor under Sky’s share price that’s higher than anyone has bid for the pay-TV group. In the process, it would hand hedge funds a risk-free payday and undermine Comcast and Murdoch’s bids just after they received antitrust clearance. Sky shareholders, who have bid its shares to 14.50 pounds, seem to be betting it will do just that."

If Fox prefers Comcast, Disney will have five business days to respond.","Comcast may have a tough time winning over Fox’s largest shareholder, the Murdoch family. They own a 17-percent stake and would face a multi-billion dollar capital gains tax bill by accepting an all-cash offer from Comcast, tax experts previously told Reuters.","Fox shareholders will vote July 10 on the Disney transaction but the company could postpone the meeting, Fox said in a statement.","Some analysts see difficulties for Comcast-Fox, which would add Fox’s movie and television studios to Comcast’s NBC Universal, but Roberts said in a letter to Fox that he would offer the same conditions as Disney and promised to fight for the deal in court if necessary.","Comcast is expected to lead a wave of traditional media companies trying to combine distribution and production to compete with Netflix Inc NFLX.O and Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google. The younger firms produce content, sell it online directly to consumers and often offer lucrative targeted advertising.","A merger between Fox and Comcast would create a company with a stable of well-known media brands and franchises, such as the X-Men superheroes. A combined company would hold the rights to air Fox’s long running TV show “The Simpsons”, the U.S. rights to the Olympics and Premier League Soccer.","Fox’s international assets such as Star India appeal to both Disney and Comcast, which want to expand their global presence.","Major sports and news assets including Fox News, Fox Business Network and Fox Sports would be spun off into a separate company.","Shares of Comcast, Fox and Disney were barely changed in after-hours trade.","Comcast in a statement outlined an offer that was similar to Disney’s, including a commitment to the same divestitures. It said that it would go to court and fight if the Justice Department tried to block the deal.","Comcast offered $35 per Fox share for the media assets, compared with Disney’s stock offer, worth $29.18 per share at the close of trade on Wednesday.","Comcast offered a $2.5 billion reverse termination fee if the deal did not go through, the same as Disney. It also offered to pay Fox’s $1.525 billion breakup fee owed Disney, if Fox went with Comcast.","Comcast said it intended to pursue its $30 billion acquisition of Sky Plc SKYB.L in parallel with its Fox bid. Comcast bid for Sky in April, after Fox's bid for the remainder of European pay-TV group it did not already own was delayed by regulators.",Fox in a statement said it had received the proposal and would review it.,"Justice Department lawyers who tried to stop AT&T’s $85 billion deal expect consumers will lose out as bigger companies raise prices, and some lawyers saw that as a concern in a Comcast-Fox deal which would put two movie studios and two major television brands under one roof.","“One cannot ignore the fact that there’s less independent content to go around,” after the AT&T deal, said Henry Su, an antitrust expert with Constantine Cannon LLP.","Still, the AT&T court fight gave Comcast valuable information about how to structure a Fox deal, said David Scharf, a litigation expert with Morrison Cohen.","Disney itself has “surgically” structured a transaction that “might be doable,” avoiding Fox Broadcasting and big Fox sports channels, U.S. antitrust chief Makan Delrahim said last week.","“I don’t think either will have a significant advantage over the other,” given that both Disney and Comcast seem motivated to divest what they need to win a deal with Fox, said Ketan Jhaveri, a former Justice Department attorney who served on the telecommunications task force."

The U.S. Department of Justice has opposed the AT&T-Time Warner deal over antitrust concerns, and a decision from U.S. District Court Judge Richard Leon is expected in June.","Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger clinched an all-stock deal with Fox Executive Chairman Rupert Murdoch in December to acquire Fox’s film, television and international businesses, giving the world’s largest entertainment company an arsenal of shows and movies to combat growing digital rivals Netflix Inc and Amazon.com Inc.","Comcast, owner of NBC and Universal Pictures, has also made a 22 billion pound ($30 billion) offer to acquire the 61 percent stake in European pay-TV group Sky Plc that Fox does not already own.

Comcast’s $31 billion offer for UK satellite broadcaster Sky just about passes financial muster. Investors expecting a higher bid from Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox, with backing from Walt Disney boss Bob Iger, are betting on the triumph of sentiment over spreadsheet.","The cable giant run by Brian Roberts on Wednesday firmed up its offer of 12.50 pounds per Sky share, beating Murdoch’s December 2016 bid by 16 percent. The move endangers the mogul’s plan to sell Fox – including Sky – to Disney for $52.4 billion in stock. It also dashes any hopes that Iger and Murdoch could persuade Roberts to back away by offering him an alternative asset, like U.S. streaming service Hulu. Assuming British regulators clear both bids, it’s a straightforward battle on price.","Comcast has the stronger hand. On Wednesday the $155 billion company said it had identified $300 million of annual pre-tax cost savings and a further $200 million of gains from combining Sky’s TV shows and movies with Comcast’s NBCUniversal library. Generously add those to consensus estimates for Sky’s operating profit in 2020, tax the lot at 18 percent, and the return on invested capital is almost 7 percent. That’s just about in line with cable groups’ cost of capital, according to New York University estimates.","It’s hard to see how Murdoch and Iger could justify going higher. The House of Mouse has less overlap with Sky’s core business as a distributor of video entertainment. Second, Comcast has greater firepower: its leverage is low for a cable group and its EBITDA this year will be greater than Disney and Fox combined, according to Eikon estimates. Besides, Comcast’s dual-class stock means Roberts does not have to fret about shareholders blocking his plans.","Iger might conclude that Sky is crucial to his European expansion. Murdoch, meanwhile, will be reluctant to part with the company he spent decades building, and might want to hang on to Fox’s 39 percent stake in case the wider Disney tie-up collapses. Nevertheless, investors who pushed Sky shares up 4 percent to 13.57 pounds on Wednesday are wagering on Disney and Fox disregarding financial sense."
