The private equity firm founded by Leon Black has appointed former Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton as lead independent director. The role is sometimes used by U.S. companies as a sort of governance half-way house. In this case, it lets Apollo delay a full separation from Black, which is what it needs most.","Black’s decision to step down as chief executive reached investors on the same day Apollo unveiled an investigation into his relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. But he is keeping the title of chair and his successor as CEO is Apollo co-founder Marc Rowan, so it’s hardly a clean break. In the buyout firm’s statement on Thursday, it’s Black and not Rowan whose praise for Clayton appears first.","By putting its governance in the hands of a lead independent director, Apollo is in good company. Both Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan have similar positions, to counterbalance chief executives who are also chairmen. JPMorgan recently replaced Lee Raymond, after more than three decades on the bank’s board, with Stephen Burke, a director for almost two decades. In that sense, Clayton stands out as truly independent, and a fresh pair of eyes. His most recent experience is as a regulatory enforcer focused on governance.","The question is whether Clayton can stand his ground against two long-serving insiders, and in this case founders. His recent track record isn’t exactly one of creating friction. Clayton was one of the few Donald Trump appointees who didn’t quit before the former U.S. president’s term ended. While he took on Tesla CEO Elon Musk over tweets to take the electric-car maker private, he also rolled back rules, like disclosure requirements on legal proceedings, in a way that benefited his regulatory wards.","Clayton’s appointment gives Apollo a new voice in the boardroom, but it also makes it possible for the firm to defer Black’s exit. With Apollo’s stock underperforming peers including KKR and Blackstone over the past year, Apollo is only prolonging what could be its most important governance step yet."

Any suggestion of blackmail or any other connection to Epstein’s reprehensible conduct is categorically untrue,” Black said on the call.","Black said he first met Epstein in 1996, when the latter was advising prominent clients, including several heads of state, Nobel laureates, and even a U.S. treasury secretary. The 69-year-old private equity veteran said he was not aware of Epstein’s criminal conduct until media reports surfaced in late 2006 of U.S. and Florida investigations into Epstein.","Black said that in 2012, three years after Epstein got out of jail following his conviction on soliciting prostitution from a minor, he retained Epstein for “personal estate planning, tax structuring and philanthropic advice” because of “misplaced comfort” in the “distinguished reputations” of the individuals in high society that Epstein continued to associate with.","“This was a terrible mistake. Had I known any of the facts about Epstein’s sickening and repulsive conduct, which I learned in late 2018, more than a year after I stopped working with them I never would have had anything to do with him,” Black said.","Epstein was found hanged at age 66 in August 2019 in a Manhattan jail, while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges for abusing women and girls in Manhattan and Florida from 2002 to 2005. He had pleaded not guilty.",Federal prosecutors and lawyers have sued Epstein’s more than $630 million estate to obtain compensation for the young women and girls he allegedly abused and trafficked.,"In January, U.S. Virgin Islands Attorney General Denise George sued the estate, seeking claims on behalf of victims he raped and trafficked on a private Caribbean island.",Black has said he intends to cooperate with the U.S. Virgin Islands inquiry and any other investigation.,Apollo said that Epstein never did any work for the New York-based firm and announced last week that three board directors tasked with probing Black’s ties to Epstein had retained law firm Dechert LLP to launch a full review.,Apollo Chief Financial Officer Martin Kelly said on Thursday the review would include going though emails and interviewing people. He said he hoped it would be concluded by the end of the year.,"Apollo co-founder and Senior Managing Director Josh Harris, seen as Black’s likely successor were he to step down, said the firm expected fundraising would slow down in the near term, as some investors waited for the review’s findings.","Kelly added that only 3% of the investor money Apollo manages could be withdrawn in the next two years, and that the firm’s big insurance investment portfolio buttressed its income from a slowdown in fundraising.","Apollo shares were down 2.8% at $37.82 in afternoon trading in New York on Thursday. “Although the stock appears oversold to us, the ring-fencing seems mostly discounted,” Citigroup Inc analyst Bill Katz wrote in a note following the earnings call.","Apollo reported a steeper than expected drop in third-quarter profit. Distributable earnings (DE) - the cash available for paying dividends to shareholders - fell to $205.1 million from $222.5 million a year earlier, as a big rise in profit in Apollo’s credit businesses was not enough to offset a steep drop in its private equity and real estate divisions.","That translated to DE per share of 47 cents, underperforming Wall Street analysts’ average forecast of 49 cents, according to data from Refinitiv.","Apollo said the value of its credit funds appreciated 3.7% in aggregate in the third quarter, with its private equity portfolio rising 8%. Its real estate, principal finance and infrastructure funds climbed 3.4% in aggregate.","Blackstone Group Inc, the world’s largest private equity firm, reported a 9% rise in third-quarter distributable earnings on Wednesday, while its private equity portfolio appreciated by 12.2%.","Carlyle Group Inc reported a smaller-than-expected 6% drop in its third-quarter distributable earnings on Thursday, with its overall fund portfolio rising 5% during the quarter.","Apollo said total assets under management rose to $433.1 billion as of the end of September, up from $414 billion three months earlier.",It ended the quarter with $45.8 billion in unspent capital and said it would pay a quarterly dividend of 51 cents a share.

The 69-year-old private equity veteran said the payments were for advice on estate planning, taxes and philanthropy.","The news has sent shock waves through Wall Street, where Apollo reigns as one of the largest investors in corporate credit and leveraged buyouts, with $414 billion in assets under management as of the end of June.","On Wednesday, the $57 billion Pennsylvania Public School Employees Retirement System (PSERS) said it would not consider any new investments in Apollo funds after speaking with the buyout firm about Black’s involvement with Epstein.","“PSERS is closely following the ongoing legal issues and the newly launched internal Apollo investigation,” PSERS spokesman Steve Esack said in a statement.","A spokeswoman for New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer, who manages the city’s five public pension funds totaling approximately $228.67 billion in assets, said in a statement they were “troubled” by these reports. “We are closely monitoring the situation in accordance with our fiduciary duty.”","The Financial Times was the first to report PSERS’ comment. Bloomberg News reported that Cambridge Associates, which manages about $32 billion on behalf of institutional investors, said it may stop recommending Apollo funds to investors. Cambridge Associates declined to comment.","Black, who co-founded Apollo in 1990, asked that the board’s conflicts committee, made up of independent board members, retain outside counsel to conduct a “thorough review” of the information he had shared about his relationship with Epstein, Apollo said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday.",The board committee has appointed law firm Dechert LLP to conduct the review.,"Apollo’s stock closed 2.6% higher on Wednesday, after dropping 13% last week.","“I think the damage to the stock has been done and investors are in a bit of a holding pattern in the near term to get some clarity to remove that overhang,” said Jefferies analyst Gerald O’Hara.","Epstein, who was charged by federal prosecutors with sex trafficking last year, committed suicide in his New York City jail cell in August 2019, before his trial.","Black and two other Apollo co-founders, Joshua Harris and Marc Rowan, control 52.9% of the private equity firm, according to regulatory filings.","“From a common-sense perspective, it’s hard not to have concerns about whether directors of a controlled company are going to exercise true independence when investigating allegations against the controlling party,” said Eric Talley, a Columbia Law School professor and corporate governance expert.",Talley said he needed to know more about the arrangement of Apollo’s hiring of independent counsel to assess its effectiveness.

But the US equity market selloff is feeding into the loan market, which is helping investors to push back and win more favorable terms on aggressive deals.","The volatility that hit the wider markets in late October is pushing US secondary loan prices lower. The SMi100 index of the top traded loans fell to a year-long low of 98.21 after trading near the year’s highs at 98.91 as recently as October 8, according to LPC data.","“The market has traded off a bit, but it’s still pretty strong overall,” a banker said. “When you see deals struggle, it’s mainly idiosyncratic with unique characteristics.”","LifePoint announced on July 23 that Apollo had agreed to buy it in a deal valued at US$5.6bn and plans to merge LifePoint with its portfolio company RCCH HealthCare Partners. Citigroup led the financing with Barclays, Royal Bank of Canada, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank and UBS.","Investors’ concerns about LifePoint or the US hospital sector are secondary, however, to their feelings about Apollo, a private equity firm with a track record of playing hard ball and extracting value from investors involved in its deals.",The sponsor’s aggressive negotiation skills were illustrated when Apollo tangled with investors over the restructuring of gaming company Caesars Entertainment Co in 2016 after a messy bankruptcy that resulted in losses for bondholders.,"“There’s definitely an Apollo premium,” a leveraged finance portfolio manager said. “We’ve been scarred. They are extremely competent but can also be brutal.”","This history has left investors keen to extract concessions from Apollo when possible, especially when market volatility strengthens their negotiating hand.","After some resistance from investors, Apollo agreed to increase pricing on LifePoint’s term loan to 450bp over Libor from initial guidance of 400bp over Libor. Strong demand following the concessions allowed the loan to be increased to US$3.55bn from US$3.4bn while a bond offering was cut to US$1.425bn from US$1.575bn. The bonds priced at 9.75%, at the wide end of guidance.",The private equity firm also extended soft call protection of 101 to a full year from six months and added quarterly conference calls. A 50bp most favored nations clause was also added for the life of the loan and the size of restricted payments baskets was cut.,The borrower also added a springing maturity provision tied to the company’s US$150m of senior unsecured notes due in 2024 during syndication.,"Investors described the pricing changes as secondary to the other adjustments, as they wanted to ensure that LifePoint’s loan had better investor protection than recent jumbo buyout loans for Refinitiv, formerly Thomson Reuters’ F&R unit, AkzoNobel’s specialty chemicals unit and physician outsourcing company Envision Healthcare, which priced at the end of summer.",Apollo’s concessions were primarily designed to ensure that LifePoint’s loan would perform well in the secondary market after the three jumbo loans were dragged lower by recent volatility. Refinitiv was quoted at 98-98.75 on Friday and Envision was at 97-97.5 after both broke for trading above par upon allocation. The loan backing the AkzoNobel deal has fared the best and is trading around 100.625-101 after it broke at 100.375-100.75.,"“The market and how this (LifePoint) would trade were the biggest areas of focus,” said a source familiar with the deal.","LifePoint’s loan broke above its original issue discount of 99 at 99.125-99.375 on Wednesday, but had dropped to 98.5-98.875 on Thursday.","“They (Apollo) definitely wanted to get a good response to the deal,” said a second banker. “They spent a lot more time than they usually spend with investors. They asked what the market wanted.”","Apollo’s new investor-friendly approach and willingness to make concessions helped LifePoint’s deal to close successfully and the secondary market pricing fluctuation was attributed to market conditions, a second source familiar with the deal said.","“Every lender lends to Apollo. This is a supply-and-demand market. It had nothing to do with the sponsor. The market will take advantage where they can just like they were taken advantage of on those buyout deals recently,” the second source added.","The concessions may help Apollo on future deals, a third banker said.","“They (Apollo) seem to be wanting to extend an olive branch of sorts and this was a way to do it,” the third banker said.",Citigroup and Apollo declined comment.

Apollo still holds a roughly 85 percent stake in ADT, which has a current market capitalization of $6.517 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.","Apollo's bottom line was also hit by a the drop in the share price of fixed annuity service provider Athene ATH.N, which was spun out of Apollo in 2016.","Distributable earnings - the actual cash available for paying dividends - was $191.2 million in the first quarter, compared with $317.2 million in the prior quarter.","New York-based Apollo’s assets totaled $247.4 billion at the end of the first quarter, down from $248.9 billion the previous quarter, partly because of valuation dips in its private equity portfolio."

On Tuesday, Xerox said its chief executive, Jeff Jacobson, and most of its board will step down to settle a lawsuit by activist shareholders Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason.","Apollo's interest in Xerox has been reinforced by the appointment of John Visentin as the company's new CEO, the sources said. Visentin was previously CEO of Novitex Enterprise Solutions and also chairman of Presidio Inc PSDO.O, two companies in which Apollo invested.","There is no certainty that Apollo’s approach will entice Xerox or that it will lead to a deal. Fujifilm has said it will challenge a court order suspending its deal with Xerox, while the new board of the latter reviews it.","The sources asked not to be identified because the approach is confidential. Apollo and Xerox declined to comment, while Fujifilm did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Deason declined to comment while Icahn could not be reached for comment.","Xerox shares pared losses on news of Apollo’s approach, and were down 5.8 percent at $30.42 on Wednesday afternoon after plunging as much as 8 percent on news of the outcome of Icahn and Deason’s legal challenge. Xerox has a market capitalization of $7 billion.","As part of the settlement with Icahn and Deason announced on Tuesday, Xerox said its board of directors would meet immediately to begin evaluating all strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value, including ending or restructuring Xerox’s deal with Fujifilm.","Icahn and Deason had already won a rare court order to temporarily block the deal, which they said undervalued Xerox. A New York judge last week agreed that CEO Jeff Jacobson had been “hopelessly conflicted” in negotiating a deal that would put him in charge, since he knew the board was looking to replace him.","Visentin had previously been hired by Icahn to assist in fighting Xerox. He had also been a candidate under consideration by the old board to replace Jacobson as recently as last year, according to court documents."
