Assured expressed frustration over the plan last week, telling the board in a letter the projections had been reached without creditor input.","In a statement filed concurrently with the complaint, Assured said “Puerto Rico’s long-term economic sustainability depends on future investment and access to capital markets, and investors will not be willing to make those investments if previous agreements are not honored.”","The fiscal plan projects about $6.05 billion of debt service capacity over the next six years, indicating big haircuts for creditor repayments. The plan is supported by the board and by Governor Ricardo Rossello, who had opposed it until this week, when he announced an accord with the board over how the plan would treat workers.","Assured’s lawsuit is an updated version of a similar one the company had withdrawn after Hurricane Maria slammed Puerto Rico in September. The storm, Puerto Rico’s worst natural disaster in 90 years, forced the oversight board to revise the island’s then-fiscal plan.","Assured alleges that the new plan does not do any better a job than the old one of respecting creditors’ liens, which it says the board is required to do under the 2016 federal law that created it, called PROMESA.","The plan does not define which government services are and are not “essential,” also in breach of PROMESA, and violates the U.S. Constitution’s Takings Clause, which bars the government from seizing private property for public use, according to the lawsuit.",Spokesmen for the oversight board and Rossello could not be reached for immediate comment on Assured’s latest legal action.

The stock’s fall essentially wiped out its gains to date this year.",Einhorn called Assured Guaranty “a melting ice cube that is paying out the drops while it still can.”,"New business coming into the company is not enough to offset the amortization of the portfolio, Einhorn said.",Assured Guaranty said it strongly disagree with Einhorn’s assertions.,"“Einhorn’s analysis of Assured Guaranty fails to acknowledge the positive implications of our significant financial strength and strong operating performance, and demonstrates a fundamental lack of understanding of our business model and the municipal debt markets,” the company said.","Assured Guaranty is well reserved for its municipal exposures and does not face liquidity risks, it said in a statement.","Einhorn said one particular problem is the company’s exposure to bankrupt Puerto Rico, which was devastated by Hurricane Maria. But the company also has some $17 billion in exposure to Illinois. Puerto Rico might just be the tip of the iceberg of the company’s problems, he said.","Einhorn also noted that the administration’s overhaul of the tax code eliminated the advantage of advanced refundings, drying up another source of business.",Einhorn often unveils short bets where he thinks the stock price will fall and surged to fame 10 years ago with a call against Lehman Brothers only months before the bank collapsed.
