In France, it would amount to an extra 2 euros ($2.16) per hour for workers in areas like packing or transport.","The world’s largest online retailer has also said it is prioritizing some products over others and making room in warehouses for key items such as hygiene and medical supplies, pet food or household staples.","The company said in response to Le Maire’s comments that the health of its staff was its top priority, adding that it was reinforcing procedures at its sites and that it “respected all workers’ rights,” including the French right to walk out.","A source familiar with the matter said that it would only apply if there was a justifiable threat to people’s health, however.","Some French workers are contesting the sanitary standards, and said they objected to potentially taking risks to help dispatch non-essential products from DVDs to sex toys.","“It’s impossible for the safety distances to be respected in the warehouses,” said one Amazon worker at a site in Lauwin-Planque, near Dunkirk in northern France, who declined to give her name.","“Our lockers are all stuck next to each other, when I come to get my belongings, we’re all rubbing shoulders.”","At Amazon’s center in Saran, south of Paris, others echoed this view.","“Everything is a problem, we keep crossing each in corridors and in the breakout area,” said Khaled Bouchajra, a worker and representative for the CGT union.","Unions could not say how many Amazon employees had worked on Thursday.

Counting the cost of no-show Mobile World Congress,"BERLIN (Reuters) - For an event meant to showcase the power of telecoms, cancelling this year’s Mobile World Congress in Barcelona without a back-up plan has perplexed many in the trillion-dollar sector.","Wednesday’s decision to call off the telecoms industry’s biggest annual gathering over fears of coronavirus, which has yet to reach mainland Spain, has left a hole in marketing budgets and dealt a $500 million blow to the local economy.","It has also raised questions about whether the four-day event, which drew 110,000 visitors last year, has become too big for its own good, while missing an opportunity to use the very communications technology that it is meant to highlight.","Sony and Nokia said after pulling out of the event that they would hold product launches online instead, while South Korea’s Samsung Electronics showcased a new folding phone at separate event in San Francisco last week.","The crisis began eight days ago when South Korea’s LG Electronics became the first company to scratch, triggering a spate of cancellations.","“The whole idea, that we’ve got to get tens of thousands of people together to meet, goes out of the window,” Mike Rosenberg, an associate professor at the IESE business school in Barcelona, said of the decision to cancel February’s event.","Rosenberg said that with China still battling the worst of the coronavirus outbreak, the GSMA mobile network operators group’s next big conference in Shanghai this summer could also be at risk.","The Chinese province at the center of the coronavirus outbreak reported a record rise in deaths and thousands more cases on Thursday under a new diagnostic method, raising fresh questions about the scale of the crisis.",Spain has so far only reported two coronavirus cases - one in the Canary Islands off northwest Africa and a second on the Mediterranean island of Mallorca.,"Catalonia’s top economic official, Pere Aragones, told Reuters he respected the cancellation decision but stressed that there was no public health danger in the Spanish region.","He called instead for a stronger alliance between the GSMA and Catalonia, adding that a way to do it would be for the organizers to extend the MWC presence in Barcelona beyond 2023, when the current contract ends.","While major exhibitors can bear the cost, hundreds of smaller companies for whom MWC is the big event on their marketing agenda may think twice about returning, analysts said.","“Now they face the challenge of having to figure out what is the best way to salvage something,” Ben Wood, chief of research at consultants CCS Insight, said.","In a show of unity, the GSMA’s leadership held a joint news conference with local leaders on Thursday, vowing to work to stage next year’s edition of the event, which has been held in Barcelona since 2006.",But Director General Mats Granryd faced tough questioning from reporters after conceding that insurance that the GSMA takes out on behalf of exhibitors does not cover an event like the coronavirus outbreak.,"“Clearly there is no way you can insure yourself out of a force majeure situation,” Granryd said.","Ramon Fernandez, CFO of French operator Orange, said cancellation was “going to cost us a bit of money, just like it’s going to cost a bit of money to all those who had planned to go.","“We’ll find a way to continue the dialogue,” he added. “A number of those who had planned to go have written us to say: ‘Let’s meet up in Paris since we won’t be able to see each other in Barcelona.’ Agendas are filling up at lightning speed.”","Communicating its decision also tested the GSMA’s public relations machine.

This is also what the Mobile World Congress, the ‘class reunion’ of our industry, stands for,” Deutsche Telekom CEO Tim Hoettges posted on LinkedIn.",But he said that large gatherings of people with many international guests posed a particular risk: “To take this risk would be irresponsible.”,"The Chinese contingent at MWC has numbered 5,000-6,000 in recent years, making the event particularly vulnerable given the outbreak of the virus that has killed more than 1,100 people on the Chinese mainland.","The GSMA said the host cities and partners respected and understood its decision, adding that they would “continue to be working in unison” towards staging next year’s event.",Hoffman and Colau are to hold a joint press conference on Thursday.,"Due to the sheer scale of MWC, with delegates packing out Barcelona’s hotels and restaurants and causing the city’s trade fair grounds to burst at the seams, postponement was never a realistic option, sources said.","A final decision was made harder by the terms under which any events insurance taken out by the GSMA would pay out, industry sources and insurance experts said. This would be unlikely to kick in unless restrictions are imposed on public gatherings in the country on health grounds.","“Where there is no ban and businesses make their own commercial decision, I cannot see the market paying out,” Edel Ryan, who is on the Special Risks team at broker Marsh JLT Specialty, said before the GSMA’s decision.","Major Chinese exhibitors, led by Huawei, had stuck to plans to attend to the very last, ordering at-risk staff to isolate themselves in advance and drafting in replacements from elsewhere to run event stands and host clients.","The GSMA had banned attendees from China’s Hubei province, where the coronavirus outbreak began, and required others to prove that they had been outside the country for at least two weeks prior to the event.","Coronavirus has proved to be contagious even when people who have caught it are asymptomatic, meaning that people attending might not even realize that they could infect others at MWC. Tracking the meetings and movements across the Fira trade grounds and the city of Barcelona of anyone who later tests positive would be a difficult task."

Other European chipmakers including STMicroelectronics STM.BN and Dialog Semiconductor DLGS.DE also gained, helped by news that Apple AAPL.O is in talks to buy Intel's INTC.O smartphone-modem chip business.","AMS, which supplies Apple with sensors for face recognition technology and suffered from lower than expected demand for the latest iPhones late last year, said demand had continued to recover in the second quarter, with revenues rising to $415.2 million, in the upper half of its $390-430 million guidance.",It expects third-quarter revenue of $600-640 million.,AMS posted second-quarter adjusted earnings before interest and tax of $50 million and said a pick up in consumer market volumes and a better operational performance should lead to an adjusted operating margin of above 25% in the third quarter.,"AMS’s third-quarter forecast is ahead of analysts’ expectations and is likely helped by uptake of its VCSEL products, said Mirabaud analyst Neil Campling.","VCSELs, used in the auto industry, are an infrared laser technology that helps to provide a large field of view and the ability to detect small obstacles. AMS entered the highly competitive market in 2017 by buying U.S. firm Princeton Optronics.","Working to reduce its dependency on Apple, AMS is investing heavily in developing products and technologies for the auto industry, such as those that would help with driverless cars.","The chipmaker's upbeat outlook chimes with comments from industry heavyweights Taiwan Semiconductor 2330.TW and Micron Technology MU.O, and from Germany's Dialog Semiconductor. STMicro is due to report second-quarter results on Thursday.","Mirabaud’s Campling questioned the logic of AMS’s interest in Osram, saying the Austrian firm would have to carve out or sell off Osram’s non-semiconductor operations - which he said accounted for about half of its business - for the deal to make sense.","“The strategic fit with AMS is a stretch in our view,” he said.","Osram, grappling with weakness in the auto industry and a broader economic slowdown, has sparked bid interest because of its potential as a supplier for connected and autonomous cars."

Broadcom, however, also said the forecast cut “extends beyond one particular customer.”","“We’re talking about uncertainty in our marketplace, uncertainty because of the - of demand in the form of order reduction as the supply chain out there constricts - compress, so to speak,” Tan said.",The semiconductor industry has been grappling with slowing demand since the second half of 2018 with bellwether Texas Instruments warning in April that a cyclical downturn could last for another two years.,That has related chiefly to signs that mobile phone markets in some major economies are increasingly saturated while mass demand in new areas like self-driving cars and internet of things devices for homes and offices is still developing.,The geopolitical risks from the trade conflict and Huawei ban are an additional shock.,"“It’s not just Huawei, it’s deeper than that.

While rumors circulated that Apple might create its own unique wireless charging technology, the company instead chose to use a system that works with Qi, an open industry standard already in use by Samsung and others.","Apple shares did not move on the news, and shares of NXP Semiconductors and STMicroelectronics, two major suppliers of chips used in Qi systems, appeared to be unaffected also."

This forecast topped a consensus view among analysts for a 9 percent fall.","Apple had shocked the sector in November by warning of slow year-end sales and did so again on Jan. 3 when it issued its first sales warning in 12 years, blaming weaker iPhone sales in China.","Those warnings hit shares in other European suppliers, like Austria’s AMS, while weak automotive markets have also weighed on larger players like Infineon and STMicroelectronics.","Some industry players have forecast a quick, V-shaped rebound in demand although persistent weakness in measures of industrial activity such as purchasing managers indexes and inventory builds suggest a recovery may be slow.","Dialog expects first-quarter revenue of $270-$310 million, representing a more pronounced than usual seasonal slowdown, with gross margins broadly in line with the 2018 figure.","Dialog is also looking to boost sales of mixed-signal integrated circuits, which can be configured by users. This business, which Dialog entered with the takeover of U.S. company Silego, is growing well, Bagherli said.","The company is seeking opportunities for its power-management chips from folding smartphones unveiled at last week’s Mobile World Congress in Barcelona. These will carry two or three battery cells that need managing, he said.","Asked about how Dialog would use the cash windfall from the Apple deal, Bagherli said he would spend some on acquisitions.","He is looking at targets in Internet of Things connectivity - in narrowband radio and WiFi - to back up Dialog’s existing strengths in Bluetooth. A follow-on deal to bolster Silego’s franchise would also make sense, he added.",Dialog reported a 2 percent rise in fourth-quarter operating profits. Revenues were down 7 percent.,"Based on its divisional performance, mobile sales fell 13 percent in the fourth quarter, mainly due to a decline in sales of main PMICs to Apple.","Taken together, other divisions showed a 20 percent rise in sales, although this was buoyed by the contribution from the Silego takeover in late 2017."

The Cupertino, California-based company said the iPhone X was the most popular iPhone model in the March quarter - the first cycle ever where the costliest iPhone was also the most sought after.","More upbeat assessments from Samsung Electronics Co Ltd 005930.KS, Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O, and Franco-Italian company STMicroelectronics STM.PA, have also eased concerns.",Samsung last month forecast strong sales for “high-density” chips that have more processing power and bigger storage capacity - demand that will help it weather a decline in overall smartphone shipments as consumers are willing to pay for costlier and faster models that allow them to easily watch and store large amounts of video.,"“Even as the number of smartphone shipments slow down, each smartphone will contain memory chips with bigger capacity and better performance, which, for memory chip makers, makes up for a slowdown in the number of total smartphones,” said Kim Rok-ho, an analyst at Hana Financial Investment.","That puts into perspective a warning by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) 2330.TW of softer smartphone sales, which was partly responsible for the recent selloff in Apple and other chipmakers.",The broader concerns about a slowdown in the chip market appear to have eased as well.,"The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index .SOX, a proxy for global chipmakers that fell sharply from its peak in mid-March on initial iPhone sales concerns, has stabilized in the past two weeks, posting a 4.4 percent rise so far this year.","The $122 billion memory chip industry enjoyed an unprecedented boom since mid-2016, expanding nearly 70 percent in 2017 alone, thanks to robust growth of smartphones and cloud services that require more powerful chips that can store loads of data.","The pace of growth is set to more than halve as memory-chip prices come off their highs, but the outlook remains strong for pure-play memory chipmakers such as Micron Technology Inc MU.O and SK Hynix 000660.KS. Micron's shares have risen 18 percent this year and Hynix's stock has gained 8.5 percent.","Revenue at Micron, for instance, has grown at an average rate of about 65 percent in the two quarters it has reported this year, and analysts expect it to grow at an average of 30 percent for the rest of the year, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.","Micron and Hynix both trade at roughly 4 times forward 12-month earnings against a sector median of 16.7, suggesting that the stocks have room to grow.","Other chipmakers like Advanced Micro Devices Inc AMD.O and Texas Instruments TXN.O, which are less leveraged to the smartphone market, including those that sell to carmakers, industrial, bitcoin, and gaming companies are well set up too.","All the same, the slowdown in smartphone shipments is bad news for chipmakers that design microprocessors: each phone needs just one microprocessor chip versus rapid growth of memory content in devices.","Global smartphone shipments fell 2 percent in the first quarter, following a 9 percent drop in the fourth quarter, according to market research firm StrategyAnalytics.","Qualcomm, whose Snapdragon processors power many popular smartphone models, recently showed just how far it is willing to go to hedge against a slowdown after revenue from its key licensing business slumped 44 percent in the latest quarter.","The company, which charges a fee for its chip patents based on a percentage of the selling price of a smartphone, said it would cap the phone price used to calculate that fee at $400. More expensive phones, which can sell for $1,000, would still be treated as $400 for the purpose of the Qualcomm license fee.","TSMC, whose fortunes are more closely tied with the broader smartphone industry as it is the world’s largest contract chipmaker, felt the slowdown more acutely in the latest quarter.",Qualcomm and TSMC stocks are down 21 percent and 2.6 percent respectively so far this year.,"“The spending cycle (by chipmakers for investment) is continuing, but there may still be volatility similar to the correction in 2015,” Tammy Qiu, an analyst at Berenberg said in a note to clients."
