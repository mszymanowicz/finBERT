It will have the capacity to produce 690 million gallons by the end of this year, Valero said.","“We expect low-carbon fuel policies to continue to expand globally and drive demand for renewable fuels,” said Joe Gorder, Valero chief executive officer. DGD first began producing the fuel in 2013.","“Valero has been a relatively early mover on renewable diesel in the U.S.,” said Marc Amons, research analyst for downstream at consultants Wood Mackenzie. “Once this is completed, assuming no other large unknown projects come online, it would place them as the largest renewable diesel producer in the U.S.”","Darling, based in Irving, Texas, collects cooking grease and animal by-products that are the feedstocks for renewable diesel that can directly replace diesel made from crude oil.","Bio-diesel, which is made from bio-mass, must be blended with hydrocarbon diesel before it can be used in motor vehicles."
