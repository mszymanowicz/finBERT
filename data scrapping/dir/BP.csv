They don’t produce any of the fuels at all. Yet the islands are deep wells of profit for European oil giant Royal Dutch Shell Plc.,"In 2018 and 2019, Shell earned more than $2.7 billion - about 7% of its total income in those years - tax-free by reporting profits in companies located in Bermuda and the Bahamas that employed just 39 people and generated the bulk of their revenue from other Shell entities, company filings show.","If the oil-and-gas major had booked the profits through its headquarters in the Netherlands, it could have faced a tax bill of about $700 million based on the Dutch corporate tax rate of 25%. The bill would have been much steeper if the income were reported in oil-producing countries - some of which levy rates exceeding 80%.","Shell and other oil majors are avoiding hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes in countries where they drill by shifting profits to thinly staffed insurance and finance affiliates based in tax havens, according to a Reuters review of corporate filings and rating agency reports. Shell, BP Plc, Chevron and Total use subsidiaries in the Bahamas, Switzerland, Bermuda, the UK Channel Islands and Ireland to provide their global operations with banking, insurance and oil-trading services, the documents show. These subsidiaries, in turn, book profits that go lightly taxed or entirely tax-free.","Such arrangements are not illegal. But they highlight the ability of international oil corporations to game global tax systems and avoid handing over revenue to nations where they conduct their core business, according to academics who study corporate taxation.","The profits generated by those offshore units are enormous, despite their tiny operations. BP’s so-called captive insurer - meaning it serves only other BP entities - had $6.5 billion in cash on hand at the end of 2018 after years of robust annual profits, according to insurance rating agency AM Best Co. The insurer, Jupiter Insurance Ltd, has accounted for as much as 14% of BP’s global annual profits in recent years, according to AM Best figures and BP’s financial statements. Jupiter has six directors but no employees; BP outsources insurance administration to a brokerage located in Guernsey, a tax haven in the UK Channel Islands.","Located about 75 miles south of the British coastline, Guernsey is not part of the UK but is a British crown dependency and sets its own tax rates. It charges no tax on corporate profits derived from revenues generated outside the island.",BP spokesman David Nicholas said Jupiter “is a UK tax resident and therefore is subject to UK tax.”,"But BP’s insurer paid no UK taxes at all in 2019, according to the oil company’s 2019 Tax Report, which was released Wednesday, the same day this story was published. BP offset Jupiter’s taxable income with losses from other UK-based affiliates, which the BP report called a typical arrangment. BP said it released the tax report - for the first time - out of a desire to be more transparent about taxation.",The report said the company does not “engage in artificial tax arrangements.”,"The big oil firms’ captive insurers are far more profitable than a typical insurance company. That’s because the amount they pay in claims accounts for a far lower proportion of the money collected in premiums - all from other affiliates of the oil giants - than is the case at other insurers, Industry data shows. That means the captive insurance units absorb part of the revenue made by the oil majors’ subsidiaries elsewhere - often in high-tax countries where they extract oil and gas - and shift it to operations located in low-tax or no-tax jurisdictions.",The oil companies have also transferred capital to tax havens to establish banking units that lend money to sister companies. Shell established an oil trader in the Bahamas that generates revenue primarily by buying and selling oil among other Shell affiliates.,"The companies named in this story all said they followed tax rules of the nations where they do business. Their subsidiaries in tax havens, the companies said, were located there for commercial or operational reasons rather than to avoid taxation.",Shell denied that its arrangements constituted tax avoidance and said the location of its subsidiaries were driven by business rather than tax reasons.,"Profit-shifting among affiliated companies has long been a concern among the Group of 20 nations, which have asked the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), which helps coordinate international taxation rule-making, to find ways to rein in corporate tax avoidance. The organization in February issued new guidance on the treatment of intra-group financial transactions, advising nations to limit deductions on such payments.",Critics of corporate tax planning say oil firms’ profit-shifting undermines their claims to responsible corporate governance and exacerbates the deep budgetary problems that many oil-producing countries face amid the coronavirus pandemic and a related drop in oil prices.,"“These companies are deliberately exploiting gaps in tax law and weak enforcement, and they are doing so in order to make enormous profits,” said Raymond Baker, president of Global Financial Integrity, a Washington D.C.-based not-for-profit organization that has lobbied for stricter international action against corporate tax avoidance. “The victims are the countries and their budgets and their people.”","Nations such as Angola, Brazil and Trinidad, who rely heavily on oil tax revenues, have had to moderate spending and increase borrowing to respond to the health crisis.","Nigeria is another country that relies heavily on oil tax revenues. Waziri Adio - executive secretary of the Nigeria Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, which advocates for stronger governance of oil revenues - said the practices of oil companies may be legal but aren’t fair.","“This is something that robs Nigeria of legitimate revenues and will affect the ability of the government to deliver badly needed services to its citizens,” Adio said.","The governments of Nigeria, Angola, Brazil and Trinidad did not respond to requests for comment.",Tax advisors said companies owe it to their shareholders to pay the lowest-possible tax bill.,"“Tax planning is a legitimate part of business,” said Bryan Kelly, a partner with law firm Withers in Los Angeles. “The board of directors has a fiduciary duty to maximize profits.”",‘THE NUMBERS DON’T MAKE SENSE’,"Shell booked $1.3 billion in 2018 and 2019 profits through Bermuda-based banking and insurance subsidiaries that together employed three people, according to the company’s ‘Tax Contribution Reports’ published in November this year and December 2019 which detail tax payments.","The tiny firms provide insurance and loans to Shell oil-producing facilities worldwide, although Shell said in its most recent tax report, published last month, that it ceased the intra-group lending from Bermuda in 2020 for reasons the company did not disclose. In 2018, the companies derived 96% of their revenues from other Shell companies.","The operations appear to exist primarily for tax purposes, said Richard Murphy, professor of political economy at City University of London. The high profitability of the Bermudan units – along with their heavy reliance on revenue from affiliates – suggests that they are designed to shift profits to low tax jurisdictions, he said.","“The numbers don’t make sense. If Shell is so good at making money in insurance and lending, why doesn’t it sell its services to outside companies and make even more money?” Murphy said.","Shell denied that its Bermuda operations are designed for tax avoidance. “Where Shell entities operate in low-tax jurisdictions, they are there for commercial and substantive reasons,” the company said in a statement.","Over $1.8 billion of Shell’s 2018 and 2019 tax-haven profits were booked by Shell Western Supply and Trading Ltd, a Bahamas-based oil trading operation employing 36 people, Shell said in its tax reports. The company buys oil from Shell fields and other producers in West Africa, Brazil and Guyana and sells two-thirds of the crude to other Shell affiliates.","The in-house oil trader outperforms other big oil merchants. Its annual profits were almost equal to the total $992 million that was earned through the end of September 2019 by independent oil trader Trafigura Group PTE Ltd - which employed 5,106 staff that year, Trafigura’s financial statements show. Shell Western enjoyed a profit margin of 4.1% across 2018 and 2019, according to its tax report. That’s more than four times the level independent oil traders typically report, according to financial statements of the three of the biggest industry players - The Vitol Group, Trafigura and Mercuria Energy Trading BV.","Margaret Cooper, a researcher at Henley Business School near London who studies multinational firms’ tax planning strategies, said that in-house oil trader’s location, its relative high profits and its dependence on trading with affiliated firms suggests that its dealings are designed to avoid taxes.","“I can’t think of any other reason than tax reasons why the company is located where it is,” Cooper said.",Shell declined to comment on whether Shell Western pays any taxes or to answer questions about whether its oil-trading operation is designed for tax avoidance. The company said in a statement that Shell Western’s profits are commensurate with its commercial activities.,"BP’s unusually profitable insurer is housed in the picturesque St Peters Port, the largest town on the island of Guernsey in the English Channel.","A 2019 report from insurance rating agency AM Best noted strong underwriting profits and operating results over the past five years, resulting in a “very strong” balance sheet, with $6.5 billion in cash at the end of 2018.",AM Best reports from previous years include more details on the operation - including immense profits that would be the envy of any insurer.,"In 2014, Jupiter had an operating ratio - which includes pay-outs and other costs as a share of premiums - of just 1.3%. That compares to more than 90% for most U.S. insurers, according to data from the Insurance Information Institute, an industry trade group. Jupiter booked profits totaling $5.8 billion from 2010 to 2013, the last year for which AM Best published profit figures. In 2013, Jupiter’s earnings amounted to 14% of the operating profit reported by BP in financial disclosures.","Jupiter’s profit margins remained exceptional through those years despite the explosion of BP’s Deepwater Horizon rig and subsequent oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, one of the worst industrial accidents in history. The incident caused $70 billion in damages, but Jupiter’s payouts to affiliated companies were capped at $1.5 billion for any one event. So, the insurer kept a loss ratio under 15% of premium income for the years 2009 to 2013, according to a 2014 AM Best report.","BP group retained access to Jupiter’s hefty cash pile because the captive insurer lends 98% of its reserves back to Jupiter’s parent, London-based BP International Ltd, for terms of a year or less, according to AM Best. BP pays interest on the money back to Jupiter, adding to the insurer’s low-tax or no-tax profits.","Murphy, the University of London professor, estimates Jupiter could save BP hundreds of millions of dollars annually given its high profitability and the high tax rates that many countries place on oil production.","Jupiter’s registered office is on the first floor of Albert House on the Esplanade, overlooking the harbor in St Peter Port. The offices are not BP’s but belong to a multinational insurance brokerage and advisory company, Willis Towers.","Richard Parris Smith, head of office at Willis Towers Management Guernsey, said his firm manages Jupiter on behalf of BP and has 30 employees that serve all of its clients. Willis Towers lists 35 other captive insurers as clients on a sign outside its office door.","California-based Chevron Corp operates a captive insurer in Bermuda. Until 2015, AM Best issued reports on Heddington Insurance Ltd and rated it highly due to its “good loss history” and “very strong investment income” made through high-interest loans to other Chevron companies. The rating agency did not report specific profit figures or operating ratios for Chevron’s insurer.",Chevron said it formed Heddington to reduce insurance costs and provide broader coverage than what is available in the commercial insurance market. The company said the insurer paid U.S. taxes but declined to detail how much or the effective rate.,"Other oil firms have tax-haven subsidiaries through which they self-insure their facilities. France’s Total SA operates Swiss-based Omnium Reinsurance Company S.A., its financial filings show. Total did not respond to requests for comment about Omnium. Switzerland offers captive insurers special tax treatment and rates of less than 10%.","Italy’s Eni SpA operates an Irish-based insurer which covers the company’s facilities in places including Algeria and Nigeria. Like Shell and BP’s insurers, Dublin-based Eni Insurance DAC enjoys lower pay-out costs as a percentage of revenue than insurance industry averages. It reported a profit of 56 million euros in 2018, on which it paid tax at a rate of just 12.5% – half the Italian rate, and a fraction of the amount it would face in oil producing countries.",Eni Insurance DAC says in its financial statements that it aims to reduce insurance costs for the Eni group. Eni said its insurer generates strong profits because it does not have marketing costs to recruit clients like most insurers. The company said in a statement that the insurer’s premiums are in line with market rates and denied the business is designed for tax avoidance.,"“The decision to establish the Eni Captive headquarters in Ireland was solely driven by business reasons,” the company said."

Besides cutting the dividend to free up cash for renewable investment, the chief executive of what is still essentially a 61 billion pound oil and gas company plans to reduce hydrocarbon production by 40% over the next decade.","The reinforced strategic commitment comes at a tough time for the current business. The chain of virus, lockdowns, falling demand and falling prices made Tuesday’s dividend cut, BP’s first in a decade, almost inevitable. Investors, who had pushed the yield on the shares above 8%, against the sector’s 5% average, were not surprised. Indeed, they were pleased. BP shares climbed 7%.","The $4 billion of cash conserved by the dividend cut will help Looney with the easy part of his mission. With net debt now at $41 billion, roughly double this year’s expected EBITDA, he is within comfortable striking distance of a net debt target of $35 billion.",Changing BP into a successful green energy company will be a lot harder. The plan starts with shrinking the old. A mix of asset sales and curbs on new exploration is supposed to cut BP’s hydrocarbon output by nearly half by 2030.,"Then there is growing the new. Some of the money not spent on oil and gas will go towards a tenfold increase in green energy investment over the decade, to $5 billion a year. That is roughly a third of forecast annual capital expenditure over the next five years. Tangible targets include 70,000 electric vehicle charging points and 50 gigawatts of renewable power capacity.","The cultural U-turn required to shift a company that has spent the last century immersed in hydrocarbons will be difficult. And BP is late to the game. Denmark’s Orsted, the world’s biggest wind-power producer now worth $60 billion, ditched oil and gas completely three years ago.","If his low-carbon punts fail to pay off, Looney and his successors could end up presiding over an outfit that is neither oil nor energy major.

The UK oil major’s new chief executive on Monday said the company would take charges worth up to $17.5 billion against second-quarter earnings after slashing long-term assumptions about crude and natural gas prices. But his greener look also amplifies the dilemma about BP’s generous dividend.,"Looney’s latest move should reassure observers who worry BP’s efforts to substantially cut carbon emissions, outlined in February, are hot air. By 2030 the group’s balance sheet will assume carbon dioxide is priced at $100 a tonne, up from just $40 today. That’s more consistent with global efforts to cut emissions to net zero by 2050. Lowering the expected future price of a barrel of oil from over $70 to $55 is also more credible given that the black stuff currently trades at less than $40.",BP’s $274 billion balance sheet can probably handle the damage. Shrunken assets could push already-high net debt towards 40% of total capital. But the ratings agencies that determine BP’s investment-grade credit status are more concerned with the company’s cash flow.,"Even so, Looney’s urgent approach to the transition away from fossil fuels, and his recent call to lay off 15% of the company’s 70,000 employees, sharpen the focus on BP’s dividend, which Jefferies estimates will cost over $8 billion in 2020. Rival Royal Dutch Shell’s, decision in April to cut its payout by two-thirds was partly received as a way to free up financial resources for lower-carbon investments. The 9% dividend yield on BP shares suggests investors expect Looney will also give himself more headroom.","The catch is that Shell has been getting heat from investors who can’t tell for sure whether it reduced the dividend to embrace the energy transition, to cover up avoidable strategic mistakes, or to reflect permanently lower oil demand as a result of Covid-19. Some shareholders think it’s just as likely that the pandemic will encourage more people into their cars, pushing up fuel consumption, and oil prices.","BP’s $30-odd billion of cash and available borrowing facilities allow it to maintain the dividend for now. At the same time, however, Looney’s lower price forecasts will restrict the company’s investments in new oil projects. Looney’s choice may be between annoying shareholders today, or in the future."

Incoming Chief Executive Bernard Looney plans to expand the company’s climate targets and is considering overhauling the structure of the oil and gas major in one of the biggest shake-ups in its 111-year history.,"The 49-year-old Irishman plans to adopt broader carbon emissions reduction goals that will likely include emissions from fuels and products sold to customers rather than just the far lower emissions from BP’s own operations, according to four sources with knowledge of internal discussions with the new CEO.","The aim is to catch up with, and possibly outdo, rivals such as Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L and Repsol REP.MC as investor pressure over climate change mounts, said the sources who declined to be named as the plans have not yet been made public.","More stringent climate targets could lead to London-based BP BP.L selling its most carbon-intensive businesses such as oil and gas fields in Angola and Canada, they added.","As part of the climate push, Looney is also looking at a broad reorganization of the company aimed at cutting costs, with one idea being explored to merge parts of the upstream oil and gas production division with refining and petrochemical operations, said five sources.","The new CEO and his team of close advisers have held an intensive series of closed-door meetings in recent weeks to outline the new strategy, according to three of the sources.","They said he would outline his “ambitions” for the company in a speech on Feb. 12, a week after he takes over from Bob Dudley.",It is unclear if Looney has decided to adopt any structural changes at this stage.,A BP spokesman declined to comment.,"Any new strategy will require a fine balancing act though, and is not without risk for a company whose pioneering efforts in the early 2000s to build a large renewables business, branded “Beyond Petroleum”, ended with huge losses.",BP will have to rely on revenue from an expanding oil and gas business to fund its green ambitions while maintaining the generous dividends that keep investors on board.,"Some industry experts say that business model may not be sustainable in a low-carbon future. They also point out that BP’s emissions are rising, as its oil and gas exploration and production activity expands, while it spends just a fraction of its investment pot on renewables and low-carbon technologies.","“Looney is coming in at a crucial moment for the oil sector,” said Morgan Stanley’s global oil analyst Martijn Rats.","“Over the next decade, companies like BP will need to maintain supply of oil and gas, for which demand is continuing to grow. That will require ongoing investment. At the same time, they will need to prepare for a decarbonised future.”","“All the while, their investors will ask them to keep up these large dividend payments. Balancing these three demands will be the key challenge.”","Looney, who is known for his energetic management style, wants to go beyond the carbon reduction targets that were set by Dudley in 2019 and limited to emissions from BP’s own operations.","The new targets will likely encompass, for the first time, emissions from the fuels and products sold, known as Scope 3, which account for nearly 90% of BP’s total emissions, according to the sources.","BP’s current targets are to reduce emissions from its own operations to net zero by 2025, equivalent to cutting 3.5 million tonnes of CO2 compared with 2016. It also agreed in a resolution adopted by shareholders to align its business with the 2015 Paris climate agreement goals.","It is not clear what reduction targets the company could set for its Scope 3 emissions. The goals are however expected to be detailed at a strategy day later this year, the sources said.","Dudley, who became CEO almost a decade ago following the Deepwater Horizon rig disaster in the Gulf of Mexico that drove BP to the brink of bankruptcy, had long resisted setting Scope 3 targets, arguing the company could not control how its fuels were being used.","While Looney receives a financially solid company, he faces fierce pressure from shareholders and activists to do more to meet U.N.-backed goals to limit global warming. In Britain in particular, BP faces regular protests and calls for boycotts.","Europe's top oil firms have all set carbon reduction goals of various breadth. Scope 3 targets could align BP with its most climate-progressive rivals: Repsol, which aims become a net zero-carbon company by 2050; Shell which has set out an ""ambition"" to halve Scope 3 emissions by 2050; and Total TOTF.PA.","U.S. majors have lagged their European rivals, with Chevron setting limited reduction targets and ExxonMobil having no targets.",See FACTBOX on oil majors’ climate goals:,(GRAPHIC: BP's CO2 emissions - ),(GRAPHIC: Going green? - ),"Looney, who joined BP in 1991 as a drilling engineer before rising through the ranks, is also considering overhauling the company’s traditional structure, aiming to reduce costs as the outlook for oil and gas prices and consumption remains uncertain.","The idea being explored of merging parts of its upstream and downstream operations is driven by the fact that they share similar management objectives such as safety, cost efficiency and reduction of carbon emissions, according to the sources.","Under the proposed changes, BP would also form a unit focused on its rapidly growing retail, marketing and power businesses. These businesses are expected to be central in the energy transition as customers switch to electric vehicles and global demand for electricity is set to soar in coming decades.","Rival Shell has already carried out a major shake-up, in 2016, establishing its integrated gas division as a separate segment following the acquisition of BG Group which sharply expanded its liquefied natural gas business (LNG).","France’s Total created a gas, renewables and power division in 2016 as it prepared to expand it LNG and low-carbon operations, spinning off parts of its upstream operations.","Energy companies see natural gas as key for the energy transition, replacing more polluting coal in power generation.",‘BALANCED BY REALITY’,"Since being announced as Dudley’s successor in October, Looney has shuttled around the world, visiting staff, partners and governments in BP’s main hubs, from India and Azerbaijan to Senegal. He has also met investors, consultants, bankers and environmental groups.","“BP needs to be a willing and enthusiastic participant in the energy transition,” said Alasdair McKinnon, manager at The Scottish Investment Trust, which holds shares in the oil major.","“But this needs to be balanced by the current reality of the economics of the low-carbon technologies” that are generally less profitable than oil and gas, he added.",The numbers underline the challenge Looney could face in meeting more ambitious emissions goals.,"As things stand, BP’s upstream emissions are set to grow by 4% between 2018 and 2025 due to higher oil and gas production in the wake of the 2018 acquisition of BHP Billiton’s U.S. shale assets, HSBC said in a report, citing Wood Mackenzie data.","However, of the roughly $16 billion per year the company invests in its business, only about $500 million goes to renewables and low-carbon technologies.","BP, which made a profit of $7.4 billion in the first nine months of 2019, is also set to pay over $9 billion in dividend and share repurchases for the year.","“Bernard knows that doing more of the same won’t win the day,” said a senior BP official. “He believes in oil and gas but is not blind to the consequences of using it and that it cannot last forever.”",(GRAPHIC: BP's recovery - )

He is friends with (Rosneft CEO Igor) Sechin, too, which is good for Rosneft.”","Dudley first worked in Russia in 1994 and was later CEO of TNK-BP, a joint venture with a group backed by four Russian oligarchs that turned sour - forcing Dudley at one time to flee Russia - but was eventually sold to Rosneft in 2011, giving BP a 19.75% stake in the oil giant and two board seats.",He was pivotal in navigating BP’s Russian operations through the fallout from Crimea and his lobbying for Rosneft has helped serve BP’s interests.,"In a previously unreported letter dating from February 2019 seen by Reuters, Dudley asked Putin to grant Rosneft tax breaks to develop a major project in Russia.","“Russian companies have limited opportunities to compete against U.S. producers and maintain their share of the global market,” Dudley wrote.","His efforts complemented lobbying by Sechin and Russia’s energy minister to help Rosneft compete against other global oil producers, especially the expanding U.S. shale industry.","Tax breaks would also help compensate Russian companies for any losses resulting from Russia’s participation since 2017 in a pact with OPEC to cut output, Dudley said in the letter.","Dudley ended the letter with a request to grant tax incentives for the Priobskoye license block, which produces around 500,000 barrels of oil per day, or about 5% of Russia’s total. No decision has been taken yet.","BP is a shale producer, and the letter was written about three months after BP completed the $10.5 billion purchase of U.S. shale assets from BHP.",BP declined comment on the letter.

The country is quickly ramping up oil production in offshore fields, many of which have significant gas volumes.","Traditionally, gas produced in such fields is burned off or “re-injected” in a process that increases crude production. But some fields coming online have too much gas for those processes to remain viable.","At the same time, there are few pipelines to bring the gas ashore and domestic consumption is weak.","The government is encouraging more gas infrastructure, and firms with gas-heavy fields, such as Norway's Equinor ASA EQNR.OL, are looking at building pipelines and onshore terminals.","“We’re convinced that there is a need for additional infrastructure to be built,” Arbelaez said. “We believe there is probably a need for between two to three ... gas processing corridors in the next 10 to 15 years.”","During the same panel, executives from Equinor and Portugal's Galp Energia SGPS SA GALP.LS also said they expected to be selling offshore Brazilian gas to consumers within the next two years.","“I have the certainty that Galp will be selling gas in the next two years to clients,” said Miguel Pereira, chief executive of Petrogal, a Galp unit. “We have to surpass some barriers but we are dealing with it.”"

BP’s incoming chief executive, who takes over next year, faces a dilemma over how to balance fossil fuels with a lower-carbon world. Third-quarter results on the surface complicate things further, but there’s a silver lining.","BP’s results were a bit of a mess. The group had to swallow a $3.3 billion writedown on the mainly U.S. assets it sold to help finance a $10.5 billion shale deal last year. That, plus a 20% drop in achieved oil and gas prices compared to the third quarter of 2018 saw a 40% year-on-year dip in net profit. The hit to equity from the writedown and a 21% jump in net debt means gearing is now 31.7%, above BP’s 20% to 30% comfort zone.","Still, BP’s call to exit Alaska in favour of markets which are cheaper and have a shorter production cycle, like the Permian Basin, is sound. BP is three-quarters of its way through a $10 billion disposal programme, which should help return gearing nearer 25% next year, and the group generated the same $6 billion of cash as the third quarter of 2018. Meanwhile, Looney has a trump card.","BP is currently likely to pay shareholders $8.3 billion in 2020, Citi analysts reckon. Factoring in cash generated by its refining arm, it’s distributing 21% of the cash flow from its exploration and production division. That’s lower than the 27% and 31% likely in dividends and buybacks from France’s Total and Exxon Mobil. And it’s a lot lower than the 43% and 56% from Chevron and Royal Dutch Shell. Even if BP just paid out around the average level of its peers, it could afford to hand over another $2 billion – a 20% hike to its current dividend.","The obvious reason for Looney to avoid doing this would be if BP was underinvesting relative to peers. But it isn’t. Shell’s dividend and buyback are 1.5 times its upstream capital expenditure, as forecast for 2020 by Citi. BP’s is only 60%.","The good news for Looney is that investors don’t yet appear to be factoring all this in. The yield on BP’s forecast dividend for 2019 is 6.4%, versus Shell’s at 6.1%. If BP’s decision to suspend its payout in shares indicates future generosity, the shares will look even cheaper."

BP, which began working in Alaska in 1959, is the operator and holds a 26% stake in Prudhoe, where production began in 1977.","In 2014, BP sold Hilcorp half its share of an Alaskan project. This year, the two were due to decide whether to go ahead with an ambitious $1.5 billion offshore project that requires construction of a man-made island.","The acquisition fits Hilcorp’s historical strategy of acquiring mature fields from major oil companies and slashing costs. The company, founded in 1990 by Texas oilman Jeffery Hildebrand, has operations across the United States.",Hilcorp spokespeople did not reply to requests for comment.,"“This deal vaults Hilcorp to be the second-largest Alaska producer and reserves holder, behind only ConocoPhillips,” said Rowena Gunn, a Wood Mackenzie energy analyst. Hilcorp must show it can maintain output at Prudhoe Bay, where BP has been the operator, she said.","Prudhoe has to date produced over 13 billion barrels of oil and is estimated to have the potential to produce more than one billion further barrels. BP’s net oil production from Alaska in 2019 is expected to average almost 74,000 barrels per day.",The deal calls for a $4 billion initial payment to BP with the remaining $1.6 billion in earnout payments over time.,"“We are steadily reshaping BP and today we have other opportunities, both in the U.S. and around the world, that are more closely aligned with our long-term strategy and more competitive for our investment,” BP Chief Executive Officer Bob Dudley said.","The Alaska sale pushes BP closer to its goal of selling $10 billion of properties following the 2018 acquisition of BHP’s U.S. shale assets, a $10.5 billion deal that catapulted the London-based company into a major Texas shale producer.","BP previously had said that most of the disposals would come from its shale assets, particularly natural gas fields. The sale would help BP reduce its debt, which rose to 31% of its market capitalization by the end of June.","The sale faces regulatory approvals, including by the state of Alaska.","State Senate Minority Leader Tom Begich said he expects the legislature to hold hearings and review Hilcorp’s environmental and safety record, which included a natural gas pipeline leak in Alaska’s Cook Inlet that lasted for months in the winter of 2016-17.","“I want to make sure they’re not just pumping hard and walking away,” said Begich. “I don’t want to be left with a mess to clean up.”","The divestment comes months after BP agreed to sell its interests in the Gulf of Suez oil concessions in Egypt to Dubai-based Dragon Oil for an undisclosed sum. It also has sought to sell U.S. shale assets in Colorado, Texas, Oklahoma and Wyoming.","BP said about 1,600 employees are currently part of its Alaskan business, adding that it was “committed to providing clarity about their future as soon as possible as part of the transition process with Hilcorp.”"

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo discussed it with Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi twice in three days, including during a surprise visit to Baghdad. Abdul Mahdi, meanwhile, said Iraq was close to signing the agreement with the American company and its venture partner PetroChina.","But negotiations subsequently became protracted over contract conditions and escalating tensions between Iraq’s bigger neighbor Iran and the United States, Baghdad’s two main allies.","Talks to reach at least an initial agreement were held up by two separate evacuations of Exxon’s foreign staff from Iraq, the first after Washington warned of Iranian threats to U.S. interests there, and the second prompted by a rocket attack that appeared to target the company.",The five senior Iraqi oil officials said the delays had forced Iraq to consider other companies to help construct infrastructure for its offshore export terminals.,"“We can’t wait for Exxon forever. We have serious problems with our sea pipelines and urgently need to find partners to help build new ones. Further delays could harm our sea export infrastructure,” said one of the officials, who oversees export infrastructure in the south of the country.","The project that Iraq is discussing with BP and Eni involves the replacement of two old seabed pipelines, including an idled one which transports crude to the Khor al-Amaya terminal.","Loading operations have been halted at Khor al-Amaya since 2017 when the pipeline suffered ruptures and leakages and had to be shut, oil officials said. The other pipeline is operating at partial capacity to ship crude oil to the Basra offshore terminal.","Under the proposed deal, BP would finance the project and Eni would handle the procurement, engineering and construction tendering aspects, the sources said.",The negotiations are in their final stages after the parties worked out a mechanism to allow the British company to recover its financing payments.,"“In principle we agreed BP could recover its payments by taking oil shipments instead of cash, just like the mechanism we’re following to pay the company to develop Rumaila oilfields,” said one of the Iraqi officials.","Eni will be paid in cash for its work, the officials said.","The seawater injection project, which Hyundai has been selected for, was also originally part of Exxon’s planned deal to develop Iraq’s southern energy installations.","Iraq has no major water injection plant and needs one for its wells or would risk losing pressure and face severe production decline, especially at its mature oilfields. As freshwater is a scarce resource in Iraq, using treated seawater is one of the best alternatives.","Three of the oil officials said Exxon had costed the project at higher than Hyundai’s $2.4 billion. They said other parts of the proposed Exxon project could go to other companies if they offered lower costs, including a project to build additional crude storage.","The Hyundai deal, announced by the state-run Basra Oil Co, still requires the final approval of the oil ministry. One of the officials said the agreement would be finalised before the end of year."

Atlantic Richfield already has spent $470 million on soil and ground water restoration at the site ordered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.,"The company, which is backed by industry groups including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the National Association of Manufacturers in the case, has said the lower court’s decision could lead to thousands more lawsuits nationwide against companies and further complicate federally mandated improvements to contaminated land.","The Superfund program, started in 1980, is intended to identify contaminated sites and ensure that those responsible for the pollution pay for the hazardous waste cleanup. It has been criticized over the years for slow efforts.","The Anaconda smelter, near the small community of Opportunity, Montana, operated between 1884 and 1980 and provided much of the world’s copper supply. It was designated a Superfund site in 1983 to reduce arsenic contamination in residential yards, pastures and ground water.","The landowners sued in state court to restore their properties to pre-smelter conditions. Atlantic Richfield said such state law claims were barred by the EPA’s actions under the 1980 Superfund law, called the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act.","The company also said the suit was prohibited under the U.S. Constitution’s so-called Supremacy Clause, which holds that federal law generally trumps state law.","In 2017, the Montana Supreme Court, the state’s highest court, ruled against Atlantic Richfield, allowing the case to move forward. Appealing to the Supreme Court, Atlantic Richfield said that decision could undermine the already-complex Superfund regime and leave companies open to thousands more lawsuits. It also could be forced to redo its work at the Anaconda site, the company said.","“This is the very definition of madness,” the company said in a legal brief.",President Donald Trump’s administration has said the Montana court improperly ruled in favor of the landowners but agreed that the case should proceed to trial before the justices hear it.,"Also on Monday, the Supreme Court declined to hear an appeal by Canada’s Teck Resources Ltd of a lower federal court’s decision holding the company liable under the Superfund law for pollution that settled in Washington state from a smelter in British Columbia.

BP did not disclose the cost of the investment.","The investment runs against current industry trends that emphasize spending on shale, which has propelled U.S. production to more than 12 million barrels a day (bpd), making it the largest producer in the world. U.S. offshore production accounts for 1.8 million bpd, but has grown more slowly.","Like its rivals, BP has completed a massive onshore acquisition, buying BHP Billiton’s onshore assets for $10.5 billion to improve its shale position. That new investment has not detracted from the company’s plans for the Gulf.","People familiar with BP’s investment decisions told Reuters that the Gulf’s vast oil reservoirs and increasingly affordable platforms make the formation a good hedge against the risks of shale, where industry’s per-well productivity has dropped by 14 percent from its 2016 high. Among deepwater basins, the Gulf of Mexico’s reliable regulatory climate makes the region particularly attractive, analysts say.","BP said it plans to increase its Gulf production to about 400,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed) by the mid 2020s. That’s about a fifth of the region’s total production. The company’s Gulf production has already increased more than 60 percent from 2013 to more than 300,000 boed.","“Those big fields keep on giving,” Starlee Sykes, the company’s president for operations in the region, told Reuters.","The new development at Thunder Horse will add 50,000 gross boed of production, with first oil expected in 2021. That’s more crude from a single project than the total Permian production BP acquired as part of the deal with BHP Billiton.",BP used new seismic imaging capabilities to identify an additional 1 billion barrels of oil in place at the Thunder Horse field.,"“One of the significant advantages of deepwater or offshore wells relative to onshore U.S. wells is their high productivity,” said Emeka Emembolu, BP’s Gulf of Mexico vice president for reservoir development. “On average, Deepwater Gulf of Mexico wells produce around 5,000 barrels of oil per day.”","Some offshore wells have production rates starting at 30,000 barrels per day, he said. That’s compared with an average of just 650 barrels a day for Permian wells, according to U.S. Energy Department statistics.","Offshore developments traditionally require hefty upfront investment, but improved recovery technologies have reduced project costs. BP has reduced its per-barrel costs to $40 a barrel or less – on par with wells in the best shale formations.","“Growth in onshore oil can only provide 15-20% of what the market needs year-on-year in terms of volume growth, so that’s why you see continued activity in the Gulf of Mexico, in offshore Brazil, and new basins popping up,” said Andrew Slaughter, executive director, Deloitte Center for Energy Solutions.","Still, in the United States shale has overshadowed the Gulf. Chevron Corp and Occidental Petroleum Corp are locked in a battle for Anadarko Petroleum Corp, with both touting onshore and liquefied natural gas assets as key attractions of the deal, rather than Anadarko’s Gulf platforms. Anadarko produces roughly 140,000 bpd from the Gulf.","Separately, Exxon Mobil Corp has started a sale process to identify a buyer for 45,000 bpd of Gulf production interests and Royal Dutch Shell agreed to sell a production platform last month.","BP has maintained a position in each of the five largest Gulf fields, and it also is one of the few of late bidding on areas not adjacent to existing properties in the Gulf.",The rest - mostly the majors and a few niche regionally-focused independent companies - have centered their exploration around acreage next to existing platforms.

BP contended that settlement administrators had misconstrued the terms of the deal and were signing off on millions of dollars of unwarranted claims. The oil company brought in Gibson Dunn & Crutcher and conducted an ad blitz portraying itself as the victim of vulturous plaintiffs' lawyers, but it was all for naught. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals and then the U.S. Supreme Court refused to undo the settlement. The appeals court even refused  in 2014 to revisit the trial court’s interpretation of the settlement, which, according to BP, made it all too easy for people to collect undeserved claims.","On Wednesday, however, the 5th Circuit said it had finally met a BP claim it could not abide.",Want more On the Case? Listen to the On the Case podcast.,"The appeals court nixed a $1.5 million award to ex-NBA All Star David West, who was in the fourth year of a five-year, $45 million contract with the New Orleans Hornets when the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded in 2010. West was paid every penny of the $45 million he was owed under his contract, including the full amount he was due in the year after the spill. He nevertheless argued – and the settlement administrator agreed – that under the definitions and formulas in BP settlement, he qualified for a payout for economic losses because he earned less in 2010 than in 2009. The 5th Circuit shut that right down.","West earned less in the year after the spill, the appeals court said, because he had signed a front-loaded contract that paid him more in the early part of his deal than at the end. “West did not suffer actual and unexpected ‘losses’ or damages,” wrote Judge Andrew Oldham for a panel that also included Judge Edith Jones and Catharina Haynes. “In 2010, he earned exactly what he was entitled to receive under his contract. The fact that West received less money in 2010 than in 2009 does not mean he ‘lost’ anything or was ‘damaged’ in any way. It means only he agreed to a frontloaded contract. And he did so many years before the Deepwater Horizon catastrophe.”","Judge Haynes said West’s claim could most generously be described as “implausible,” in a concurrence in which she said West claims should be remanded to the trial court rather than rejected outright.","You’re probably wondering how West’s lawyers from Barrasso Usdin Kupperman Freeman & Sarver could possibly justify a $1.5 million demand from a multimillionaire who was paid all that he was due under his contract in the year after the Deepwater Horizon spill. The answer lies in the structure of the BP settlement. As West’s counsel explained in their brief to the 5th Circuit, employees of the Hornets (now renamed the Pelicans) were designated to be eligible for economic damages under the BP settlement because the team was considered a “tourism industry business” affected by the oil spill. West was indisputably a Hornets employee – and he indisputably earned less in the year after the storm, as he proved in documents submitted with his claim.","Ergo, according to his lawyers, he was entitled to payment from BP – which is why his claim was approved by the settlement administrator and left intact by U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier of New Orleans, who oversees the BP case. Any contrary arguments by the oil company, West contended, were simply another BP attempt to rewrite the settlement agreement.","That contention is pure chutzpah, according to BP, and from a guy so rich that in 2015 he forewent a $12.6 million option when he left the Indiana Pacers to play for the San Antonio Spurs. BP’s lead lawyer, Lisa Blatt of Williams & Connolly argued in the company’s appellate brief that the settlement agreement may not require oil spill victims to provide evidence linking their economic losses to the oil spill but it does demand that claimants attest they suffered economic harm as a result of the spill. West suffered no economic loss as a consequence of the spill, BP said, so the attestation he submitted with his claim was “patently false.”","“West does not dispute that he received exactly the post-spill earnings set forth in his lucrative pre-spill contract,” BP told the 5th Circuit. “The settlement agreement compensates individuals and businesses for actual losses. It was not designed to pay individuals for a dip in compensation dictated exclusively by a long-established contract.”","The appeals court did not go so far as to accuse West of filing a false declaration claiming economic losses, but the judges agreed that his theory – that he has a claim because he earned less after the spill than before it – “puts the cart before the horse.” To invoke the claim process, the 5th Circuit said, you have to have suffered a loss. West didn’t, so, according to the appeals court, he can’t recover from BP.","“West expected to earn in the absence of the spill precisely what he did earn after it,” the opinion said. “He therefore did not suffer unexpected damages.”",Amen to that.,I emailed West counsel Stephen Kupperman of the Barrasso firm but didn’t hear back. BP counsel Blatt had no comment.

The BP chief executive, whose $138 billion oil producer owns 20 percent of Sechin’s $67 billion Rosneft, may look covetously at the Russian group’s fat margins. Sechin, meanwhile, will look ruefully at Dudley’s much perkier valuation.","Both groups’ annual results released on February 5 show solid performances. BP’s net profit almost trebled to $9.6 billion, while Rosneft’s more than doubled to $8.9 billion. BP beat expectations in the fourth quarter in both exploration and refining. Yet in a number of important areas Rosneft’s operations are superior. Aside from producing 5.8 million barrels per day compared to BP’s overall 3.7 million bpd, its margins are bigger. In 2019 it is anticipated to make a 25 percent EBITDA margin on $133 billion of revenue, against BP’s 13 percent.","That’s not surprising. Rosneft exports much of its oil in dollars, but its costs are in a rouble that depreciated by over 20 percent against the dollar in 2018. That gives Sechin a tangible head start over Dudley.","Yet that isn’t reflected in the two companies’ valuations. BP trades on over 12 times its expected earnings for 2019, while Rosneft languishes at less than six times. Rosneft’s dividend yield for the same year is almost 9 percent, compared to BP’s 6 percent.","The market isn’t missing something. The difference between Rosneft and most western oil majors is that the former is largely owned by the Russian state. That means it can be used for geopolitical purposes that go beyond conventional shareholder value. Even though repayments have whittled the $6.5 billion lent to Venezuela’s state oil firm down to under half that level, the risk is that a change of government in Caracas leaves Rosneft with big losses.","A more obvious problem is sanctions. The U.S. is already restricting Rosneft’s ability to raise long-term finance. While it’s unlikely that Washington extends that to actually preventing the Russian group from exporting its products to western markets – as aluminium group Rusal was confronted with last year – that probability is not zero. Until Russia’s relations with the West thaw, Sechin will be the more envious oil tsar."

It is an example of how technology is helping deepwater make a comeback after a decade when the industry has focused on advances in onshore shale.","The new deposit was found with software known as Full Waveform Inversion (FWI), which is run on a super-computer and analyses reverberations of seismic soundwaves to produce high-resolution 3D images of ancient layers of rock thousands of meters under the sea bed, helping geologists locate oil and gas.","It is more accurate than previous surveying methods, BP said, and processes data in a matter of days, compared with months or years previously.","While the discovery marked the biggest industry success for digital seismic imaging, the British oil major’s rivals are hot on its heel with similar techniques.",(Oil majors' R&D: tmsnrt.rs/2ATrIHU),"BP scientist John Etgen, the company’s top adviser on seismic imaging, said it aimed to retain its edge with a new machine it has developed, Wolfspar, to be used alongside FWI.","The submarine-like Wolfspar is dragged by a ship through the ocean and emits very low frequency soundwaves, which are particularly effective for penetrating thick salt layers that lie above rocks containing fossil fuels, he added.","Etgen told Reuters that BP planned to roll out Wolfspar alongside FWI in the second half of this year at the Atlantis field in the Gulf of Mexico, where a large salt layer still hides parts of the site. The company plans to expand the use of the technology to other big oil and gas basins, including Brazil next year and Angola at a later stage, he said.","“Seeing through very complex, very distorted salt bodies was the hardest problem we had, the most challenging,” the Houston-based scientist said in an interview.","In both Brazil and Angola, oil deposits are locked under thick salt layers. Brazil’s deepwater oil fields comprise one of the world’s fastest-growing basins in terms of production. BP last year signed a partnership with Brazil’s national oil company Petrobras to develop resources there.","Billion-barrel oil finds are rare, particularly in mature basins like the Gulf of Mexico. But the scale of output from deepwater wells means they can compete with the most low-cost basins in the world, in particular U.S. shale.",BP is far from alone in focusing on technology; all big oil companies have put a growing emphasis on digitalization to reduce costs following the oil price collapse of 2014.,"In fact, BP’s spend on R&D was the third lowest among the world’s top publicly traded oil companies in 2017 at $391 million, compared with Exxon Mobil’s $1.1 billion and Royal Dutch Shell’s and Total’s budgets of over $900 million.","Other majors have also made advances. Italy’s Eni has launched the world’s most powerful industrial computer to process seismic data, for example, while France’s Total is using drones to carry out seismic mapping in dense forests such as in Papua New Guinea.",However Barclays analysts said in a report last year that BP and Norway’s Equinor had the most advanced deployment of technology among oil majors.,‘MAGIC’ ALGORITHM,The seismic breakthrough for BP came when Xukai Shen tested a new idea he had for the FWI algorithm in 2016.,"“What happened was magic - the pieces came together,” recalled Etgen. “We finally had the right algorithm with the right data set to create the model of the salt formation and use the model to remove distortion.”",BP says its new seismic technology could save it hundreds of millions of dollars in exploration hours by pinpointing the location of the most promising deposits.,"“It allows us to drill the right wells, drill wells at lower costs, drill wells in the best part of the reservoir, drill fewer wells,” Etgen said.",The costs of the technology are a fraction of BP’s oil and gas production budget of around $12 billion per year.,"An FWI survey costs up to $20 million to carry out, while processing the data costs up to $10 million, Etgen told Reuters. The annual spend on the super-computer that runs the software is about $20 million.","“The companies that are investing in technology are coming through and winning the race,” Henry Morris, technical director at independent North Sea-focused explorer Azinor Catalyst.",“That’s where BP are doing a good job. It’s working.”,"Seeing through salt layers with confidence “adds real value” and saves companies the premiums they must pay to acquire resources through acquisitions, according to Bernstein analysts.","“With high-performance computing, the seismic processing and interpretations are being done in two weeks rather than 1,000 years, as it would have been if they still used 20th century computers,” they said.",“Investors should therefore expect more from BP with this edge.”

This is a very important signal the country is giving, creating a stable regulatory environment that will allow companies to invest,” Lindenhayn told Reuters on the sidelines of an energy presentation at the company’s corporate office in Sao Paulo.",RenovaBio will mandate fuel distributors to gradually increase the amount of biofuels they sell. The program aims to double the use of ethanol by 2030 from around 26 billion liters currently. The program also targets increases for other renewables such as biodiesel.,"BP has three ethanol mills in Brazil, crushing 10 million tonnes of sugar cane per year. It formed a venture last year with Brazil’s Copersucar, a leading global ethanol seller, to jointly operate one of the largest fuel terminals in the country located in Paulínia, in Sao Paulo state.","Lindenhayn said the program provides an opportunity for mills in Brazil, which have experienced stagnation caused by years of low sugar prices and a long period of subsidized gasoline prices that led to the closure of many firms.","“If the program advances as planned, it will be a large opportunity. There are no greenfield projects around, and the country is a net fuel importer,” he said.","Asked if BP would be interested in increasing ethanol capacity via acquisitions, since there are several assets being offered in Brazil by companies with financial difficulties, Lindenhayn said: “We will see, we will consider.”","On Wednesday, Brazilian oil and fuels regulator ANP published in the official gazette another part of RenovaBio complementary legislation, with rules for biofuel companies to obtain certification.","With that, the plants will be able to issue and trade emissions reductions credits, called CBios, that fuel distributors could buy to comply with targets in case they fall short. It would be Brazil’s first emissions reductions market, although limited to the fuels industry."

In October Equinor cut its spending for 2018 to $10 billion from $11 billion through cost cuts.,BP chief Bob Dudley was similarly resolute.,"“We’re planning the future of BP and always have through the cycle on $50 to $60 (a barrel), so it (the oil price) is not changing our capital investment plan.

That’s why we see Clair Ridge being out there for 40 years,” BP’s head of North Sea Ariel Flores told Reuters.","“We will learn and continue to push the limits to what we believe is economically recoverable,” he added.","Clair Ridge is expected to produce 120,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day at its peak and will involve drilling several new wells.","BP is today planning the third phase, Clair South, and with its partners - Royal Dutch Shell, Chevron and ConocoPhillips - will decide on whether to go ahead with the project in 2019 or 2020, Flores said.","Elsewhere, new reserves continue to be discovered in the region. Total announced in September a major new discovery in the Glendronach area, which it estimates holds one trillion cubic feet of gas.","“We’re only just scratching the surface of some of the gas plays and some of the other oil plays in the region,” said Phil Kirk, chief executive of private-equity backed Chrysaor.","His company holds a stake in BP’s 130,000 bpd Schiehallion field in West of Shetland and one of the world’s largest floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessels.","Shell and BP are also developing the Alligin field which will involve linking two wells to the Glen Lyon FPSO, which will lower the project’s costs.","Equinor is expected to develop the Rosebank field, which it acquired from Chevron earlier this year and is estimated to cost $6 billion, according to Wood Mackenzie.","The Norwegian oil and gas firm is aiming to simplify the field’s plans in order to reduce its costs, but that will probably lead to a delay in the start of development into 2020 at least, a source involved in the project said.","Private equity-backed Siccar Point drilled a test well at the Cambo field this summer in the area, and is expected to decide next year on its development together with its partner Shell.","“The West of Shetland is vital to the future of the UK oil and gas industry,” Wood Mackenzie analyst Kevin Swann told Reuters.","With many fields in other regions facing closures in the coming years “we expect projects in the West of Shetland to account for more than 70 percent of total UK development spend in the mid-2020s,” he added.","The region is also under-explored compared to other parts of the North Sea, with only 160 exploration wells drilled so far.","Clair Ridge is a reminder however of lax practices seen in the oil and gas industry earlier in the decade, when oil prices soared and project costs ballooned with them.",The project was approved for development in 2001 with a budget of $4.5 billion. Its final cost reached $4.9 billion and production started years later than planned.,"The collapse in oil prices in 2014 forced companies to slash costs and simplify projects in order to survive in a world where a barrel of oil traded at $40, compared to today’s prices of around $62 a barrel.","The North Sea, and West of Shetland in particular, has learnt to adapt better than other regions, Flores said.","While Clair Ridge required a hugely complex construction process, the next phase, Clair South, will involve simpler and lighter designs, cheaper equipment requiring fewer crane lifts and technology including subsea robots that will radically reduce costs, he said.","In a sign of confidence in Clair, BP increased its share in the field in July to 45.1 percent in a swap deal with ConocoPhillips, from around 29 percent.","The region could get a further boost if programs such as Hurricane Energy’s Lancaster project, which targets fractured basement rock formations, open up deeper, untapped layers of rock.","“If you want to be anywhere in the UK continental shelf, you want to be in the West of Shetland,” Hurricane Energy Chief Financial Officer Alistair Stobie told Reuters."

Anand, said in September.","Nayara previously depended on close to 30 Indian banks for its financing, adding foreign exchange costs as it would have to buy crude in dollars using Indian rupees - an untenable and expensive proposition.",Pre-payment deals are a normal mechanism to raise funds but Western banks were initially hesitant to participate in Nayara’s deals due to the Russian companies’ stakes in it and the refiner’s reliance on Iranian and Venezuelan oil.,Russia has been under U.S. and EU sanctions since 2014 when it occupied Ukraine’s Crimea peninsula and Rosneft is under limited sanctions. Washington re-imposed sanctions on Iranian oil in early November and the Trump administration has weighed restrictions on Venezuelan oil.,Nayara’s previous ownership under debt-ridden conglomerate Essar Group added to the qualms.,"However, a banking source said that Nayara’s intention to stop buying Iranian oil and a company name change improved the compliance outlook for the bank.","For the current $1.5 billion deal, BP, Trafigura and bankers involved will float a special purpose vehicle while for the previous such transactions that mandate was directly given to the buyers.",Trafigura declined to comment. BP did not immediately respond to a request for comment.,"Asked for comment on the fuel-backed loan, Nayara said in a statement sent to Reuters that its improved financial performance and credit rating over the last year had attracted more interest in working with the company.","“This transformation of the company in the last one year has resulted in substantial interest from the top global and domestic banks who wish to partner with the company,” Anup Vikal, Nayara’s chief financial officer, said.",“As a part of this drive toward further efficiency and global interest we are constantly evaluating multiple opportunities including export advance as the company moves into the new era.”,"Deutsche Bank and ABN Amro are among the foreign banks involved, the sources said.",The banks did not immediately respond to a request for comment.,The new deal would bring Nayara’s total pre-payment transactions during the year to nearly $3 billion.,"Trafigura and BP have already completed two similar deals. Syndication of a $1 billion prepayment, first reported by Reuters early this year, was finalised in September for a lower amount of $750 million over 15 months, one of the sources said.

That implies BP is paying $8 billion, or $17,000 per acre. Moreover, the company thinks the $10.5 billion price tag can be achieved by discounting the assets’ future value at 10 percent and assuming an oil price of $55 a barrel. As long as crude values hover above $70 a barrel, the price looks cheaper.","BP investors have two other reasons to feel sanguine. First, the company has been underexposed to the hottest market in global oil since the sale of its U.S. shale assets in 2010. Adding the equivalent of 190,000 barrels of oil per day to production may seem small beer against 2017 annual output of 3.6 million barrels per day. But shale production cycles are much shorter than those of traditional oil projects, so these assets are more likely to be exploited before oil demand peaks.","Second, BP’s balance sheet is healthy enough to take the strain. While it will use cash reserves to pay half of the $10.5 billion, it could well generate $5 billion in both 2019 and 2020 after accounting for capital expenditure and dividends, according to Jefferies analysts’ estimates. An equity hike will pay for the rest but will be neutralised by a buyback, itself funded by asset disposals.","BP investors are aware that BHP spent $30 billion trying to make the most of the assets before today’s deal, and had to swallow a final $2.8 billion writedown on Friday. But the logic behind the oil major’s own deal is sound."

It had come under pressure from activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp to do so.","The acreage for sale includes holdings that BHP acquired in its $12-billion takeover of Petrohawk Energy in 2011, which have declined rapidly in value as the price of natural gas has fallen from $4.50 at the time of the deal to a low of $1.60 last year.","In 2015, BP began operating its onshore U.S. business as a separate entity to make it more competitive. Since then, BP has expanded the business to include acreage in the Haynesville and Bossier shale plays near the Texas–Louisiana border.","However, BP’s expansion in U.S. shale fell behind many of it peers. When others were building out their presence onshore, BP’s focus was on the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon oil-spill disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, which has forced it to pay tens of billions of dollars in damages and restitution since 2010.","If completed, the acquisition of BHP’s acreage would be transformational for BP’s unit, adding oil-rich wells in the Permian and Eagle Ford basins of Texas.","Other oil majors that participated in the auction for the assets include Royal Dutch Shell Plc RDSa.L and Chevron Corp CVX.N, sources have said.",(This version of the story has been refiled to fix reference to BHP in paragraph 5 to “BHP” instead of “HP.”)

None.”","Carbon emissions grew last year by 1.6 percent, compared with little to no growth in the previous three years but still lower than average growth of 2.5 percent in the 10 years to 2014.",A landmark climate agreement reached in Paris in 2015 calls for halving carbon emissions by 2040 and reducing them to net zero by the end of the century to limit global warming.,"“Three years of flat growth was a step in the right direction, but it wasn’t a big enough step,” Dale said.","Steady and robust growth in oil demand over the past five years, the strongest since 2007, was driven by lower crude prices but could be undercut by the recent rally that took prices to their highest since 2014, Dale said.","“There are some signs that the boost from low oil prices may be beginning to wane,” he added.","On the supply side, the surge in production of U.S. shale oil, also known has tight oil, has redrawn the global market. The United States overtook Saudi Arabia in 2017 to become the world’s second biggest producer behind Russia.","A 2017 agreement between OPEC, Russia and other major oil producers to reduce global output by 1.8 million barrels per day (bpd), combined with a sharp fall in Venezuela’s output, drove down global inventories to their five-year average, BP said.",But a 2 million bpd growth in U.S. oil and natural gas liquids since October 2016 offset a large part of the cuts.,"“OPEC has always had the power to stabilize the market in response to short-term fluctuations,” Dale said. “OPEC has never had the power to try to offset structural long-term shocks to the market (such as) the emergence of new sources of supply and the growth of electric cars.”",“The rapid response of U.S. tight oil just reinforces that point.”,"Rising exports of U.S. crude and new refineries in Asia and the Middle East have also led to a surge in global oil trading, which grew by more than 4 percent last year compared to a 10-year average of 1.7 percent, Dale said."

To me that was a moment of the unthinkable was possible.”",Dudley says he no longer sees BP as an acquisition target after facing years of speculation it could be bought out.,"The company is focused on increasing production and cash flow while reducing its large debt pile, after which it will consider boosting shareholder returns such as dividends although “we’re not at that point yet”, Dudley said.",Longer-term challenges also loom.,"Investors are increasingly pressing energy companies to find ways to adapt to the energy transition, and Dudley is looking to strike a balance between reducing a large carbon footprint while securing revenue.","“This is the great dual challenge that the industry and BP faces: how to supply the world’s energy on multiple fronts of growing population and doing it with less emissions,” said Dudley, who was appointed to the helm of BP months after the April 2010 spill.","BP, like rivals such as Royal Dutch Shell, is betting on natural gas, the least polluting hydrocarbon, to sustain an expected surge in demand for electricity as economies grow and transportation is electrified.",Gas is also playing a key role as a back-up to renewable energy such as wind and solar in power generation.,"To that end, BP is expanding its gas production through new projects in Oman, Egypt and Trinidad and Tobago.",Gas already accounts for over 55 percent of its production.,"“I am optimistic about the climate change if you can combine renewables wind and solar and natural gas. To me that’s part of the big answer,” Dudley said in an interview with Reuters.","In the early 2000s BP introduced the slogan “Beyond Petroleum” and adopted a sunburst logo after launching an $8 billion expansion into renewables. The company was forced to write off its solar business 10 years later, but still retains a large U.S. onshore wind business and biofuels plants.","Now, Dudley is taking a cautious approach, investing in smaller start-up companies in renewables, clean fuels and battery charging docks.","“We have to go slow and pick the right low carbon fuels,” he said. BP “will be a broad-based company that supplies all forms of energy that are needed that can be done economically.”","The company will invest $500 million per year in low-carbon energy and technology in the coming years out of a total spending of $15 to $17 billion, a range which Dudley said the company could stay within.","“If a shareholder or someone else came to BP tomorrow and said here is $10 billion to invest in low carbon energies for us, we would not know how to do that yet.”","BP is also expanding its vast global network of petrol stations and investing in convenience stores and charging spots, hoping to retain its dominant brand as electric vehicles become more popular.",“I’m not worried about BP in this area. The most strategic thing we can do is to get our balance sheet strong so that when we have the firepower we can do anything in these areas.”,"BP expects demand for oil to peak in the late 2030s, after which it will plateau and gradually decline.","For BP, whose roots go back to 1908 with the discovery of Iran’s first oil field, the days of the black gold are far from dead.","While oil prices in recent weeks have hit their highest levels since late 2014 at $80 a barrel, BP are working on an assumption that prices will remain at a range of $50-$65 per barrel due to surging U.S. shale output and OPEC’s ability to crank up output.","Mega projects involving complex, multi-billion facilities such as huge offshore platforms that came to symbolize the technological prowess of the world’s top oil companies are most likely a thing of the past, Dudley said.","Instead, BP is opting for phased developments that require less capital and less time to construct, which make them easier to control at a time of uncertainty over oil prices.","“Many of the companies in the industry are remembering the lesson learned during the $100 oil era (which) is take it in phases,” Dudley said.","BP is applying this approach in many of its main production hubs such as Egypt and Gulf of Mexico, where it can continue raising production into the early 2020s, Dudley said.","BP’s oil and gas output is set to reach around 4 million bpd by the end of the decade, a level last seen in 2009, with more than a fifth of that coming from projects started since 2016.","It is partnering with top oil producing nations which have some of the lowest costs of extraction such as Oman, Azerbaijan and most importantly Russia, where BP has a 19.75 percent stake in Rosneft and where it draws one third of its production.","BP has a relatively small shale business, focused mostly on gas, but Dudley is considering growing in the sector, which has attracted billions of dollars in investments in recent years.","“(Shale) comes down to economics and competitiveness on what is on offer. So far they feel overheated... it is not a burning need to fill that in the portfolio, but if it is attractive, we will.”","BP could place a bid for BHP Billiton’s shale assets, Dudley said.",BP’s position in Russia has put the firm in the spotlight as the United States and Europe tighten sanctions on Moscow.,"Dudley, who sits on the board of Rosneft, believes BP can continue there and act as a bridge between countries.","“We don’t apologize for doing business in Russia,” said Dudley. “Certainly today within the boundaries of the sanctions we can and do operate without issues.”","BP will continue to operate in Russia and expand projects with Rosneft even though the company has had to turn down certain offers to develop projects offshore or in the Arctic, he said.","Dudley also said BP remained committed to its stake in Rosneft, which it received following the 2013 sale of TNK-BP."

Brent crude is currently trading around $75 a barrel. [O/R]","BP launched seven oil and gas fields in 2017, a record year, and is set to inaugurate six more projects this year including in Egypt, Azerbaijan and Britain’s North Sea, which will help it boost production by 800,000 barrels per day (bpd) by 2020, most of it gas.",First-quarter production rose 6 percent to 3.7 million bpd.,"“It’s not only about the oil price, it is also about the performance of the kit,” Gilvary said.","BP’s gearing, the ratio between debt and BP’s equity market value, stood at 28.1 percent at the end of the quarter, up from 27.4 percent at the end of 2017.

But a combination of self-help and higher prices could turn the recovery’s latter stages into a sprint.","Chief Executive Bob Dudley had a decent first quarter. The group’s underlying replacement cost profit, its preferred definition of net income, was over two-thirds higher than the first three months of 2017, whereas other big oil peers have on average seen net profit rise by a third, according to UBS analysts. BP’s production business beat forecasts, helped in particular by gas, and its refining arm also exceeded expectations. Operating cash flow excluding Gulf of Mexico costs and working capital exceeded $3.9 billion of capital expenditure and $1.8 billion of dividend payments.","Dudley’s solid operational performance is a good start, but BP’s main problem of late is the fact that its break-even point – the oil price at which it can generate free cash flow after paying for capital expenditure and dividends – is higher than peers. Including Gulf of Mexico costs but also disposals, BP needed an oil price around $60 a barrel to break even in 2018, according to Macquarie – compared to the mid-$40s for Total and below $40 for Shell.","The good news for Dudley is that without the Gulf of Mexico albatross his break-even price drops to $50. A combination of these costs tapering off and better discipline on more recent projects means that the break-even price should eventually be around $35 to $40. Even so, this isn’t until 2021.","That’s where the recent oil price spike comes in. The combination of a tighter market due to OPEC production cuts and geopolitical tensions means that crude values should average $67 in 2018, according to a Reuters survey of 38 economists and analysts released on Monday. If so, BP should enjoy more free cash flow, and a faster transition from being the poor relation of global oil majors."

In addition, independent third-party groups would be allowed to do some certifications and verifications on parts of blow-out preventers, which seek to stop the uncontrolled releases of crude, according to the fact sheet.","The 2010 Macondo disaster killed 11 oil rig workers, was the biggest environmental disaster in U.S. history, and has cost BP about $65 billion.","While drilling interests had pushed the agency to revise the rule, Scott Angelle, the director of BSEE, said in a blog that the agency would never put offshore workers or the environment at greater risk. “At the same time, we are equally dedicated to addressing overly burdensome regulations and, even more so, to amending or eliminating regulations that may decrease safety or increase the chances of environmental harm,” he said.","Randall Luthi, the president of National Ocean Industries Association, said changes to the rule would increase efficiency and “do not, in any way, constitute a rollback in offshore safety.”","U.S. Senator Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat, was concerned the revisions would weaken the offshore regulations. “These rules were put in place to prevent another massive oil spill off our coasts,” he said. “We can’t allow this new administration to take us backwards in time.”",The proposal will be published next week and open to a 60-day public comment period.
