Its executives added that the sales momentum has carried into the current quarter, with its quarter-to-date gross revenue growth trending up roughly 90% from a year earlier.","“We are seeing not just robust new customer acquisition but also strong repeat trends from both long-term loyal and recently added new customers,” Chief Financial Officer Michael Fleisher said.","The Joss & Main furniture e-store owner has also been benefiting from the temporary closure of physical furniture stores in the United States, as it posted a 19.8% increase in sales in the first quarter ended March 31, helped by a surge in orders in the month of March.","Fleisher, however, said Wayfair’s performance thus far puts it on a trajectory to achieving positive consolidated adjusted EBITDA margin in the second quarter even without the impact of the virus-led rise in sales it is experiencing.","Wells Fargo analyst Zachary Fadem said Wayfair, in an unexpected fashion, delivered a narrative-changing message, as recent cost efforts are bearing fruit in the form of a second-quarter profit inflection.","The company’s first-quarter net sales of $2.33 billion beat Wall Street estimates of $2.31 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.","Wayfair also said the number of active customers in its direct retail business increased 28.6% to 21.1 million as at the end of the quarter, from a year ago.","The company, however, posted a net loss of $2.30 per share, but was smaller than the average analysts’ estimates of a loss of $2.60 per share.","Wayfair’s shares, which have increased over 81% this year, were up 22.2% at $163.89."
