At least two existing programs could potentially provide serviceable amounts of the fuel for testing, it said.",Centrus spokeswoman Lindsey Geisler said the firm is the only American company pursuing production capability of the fuel and that its competitors are foreign state-owned companies that benefit from a range of government support.,"Centrus “will deliver the best, most economical, domestic source of HALEU - a critical step to re-establishing American leadership in the global nuclear industry,” she said.",The DOE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.,"Nonproliferation experts say HALEU may be a target of militants looking to enrich it further to produce crude nuclear weapons. HALEU is enriched to up to 20% uranium 235, far more than the than fuel used in today’s reactors which enriched to about 5% uranium 235.",The lawmakers want the Energy Department to provide information by Dec. 3 on a series of questions including whether the project is intended to satisfy Defense Department requirements in addition to nuclear power goals.
