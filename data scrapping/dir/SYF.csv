Sure, the U.S. conglomerate’s earnings fell by nearly one-third year-on-year in the three months ended June 30 – but at least the nature of the challenge is now clear.","GE slashed its cost base by $1.1 billion in the first half, putting Flannery more than halfway to his 2018 target of $2 billion. The group’s healthcare division boosted revenue by 6 percent in the second quarter and operating profit by twice that rate. The unit’s spinoff, due to take place by the end of next year, should help GE halve the level of debt attached to its industrial businesses.","The real worry remains GE’s power division, bulked up under Jeff Immelt, Flannery’s predecessor. Orders fell by 26 percent year-on-year in the latest period, and operating profit more than halved. Demand for its gas-powered electricity turbines is weak, and will remain so. Meanwhile, GE’s renewables division isn’t fully benefiting from the industry’s shift. It focuses on wind power but not solar, and fierce competition drove double-digit declines in orders and revenue in the quarter.","These are at least things investors can see coming. The previous two quarters included $8 billion of charges for exposure to long-term-care insurance losses and mortgage litigation at its GE Capital unit. There’s none of that this time, though the financing arm remains a black box and will need a $3 billion capital injection next year.","That leaves aviation – GE’s best-performing bit. Orders jumped 29 percent in the quarter, and look set for continued strong growth after notching $22 billion in commitments at Britain’s Farnborough air show last week. The division generated half of the group’s operating profit, and more than 80 percent of what will be the new GE. Like an aircraft, GE really should have more than one engine, but this is at least enough to stay aloft."

Cash flow from assets sold is obviously gone making dividend unsustainable.”,"GE shares tumbled 7.7 percent to $14.11 in afternoon trading, putting them on track for the biggest daily percentage decline since Flannery became CEO last August. The stock’s previous record drop under Flannery was 7.2 percent on Nov. 13, when he gave his first major update as CEO.","Former CEO Jeff Immelt, speaking a year ago at the same conference Flannery addressed on Wednesday, said there was a “mismatch” between GE’s value and the performance of the company, and that the stock should climb.","Instead, GE’s shares have fallen 47 percent in the past year as profit deteriorated at its power business and GE revealed unexpected liabilities in its GE Capital unit.",Since early April the stock climbed 20 percent as analysts reassessed the company’s prospects now that it has installed a new board and begun making the promised asset sales.,"But that view appeared to be undercut by Flannery’s remarks on Wednesday. He said he expects no profit growth at its large power business this year, and is planning for the power market to remain weak through 2020. Profit at the unit tumbled 53 percent last year to $1.9 billion.","He affirmed GE's targets for 2018 profit and free cash flow, and said profit at GE's Baker Hughes BHGE.N oil and gas unit would rise by 50 percent or more this year, while profit at the aviation business would be up 15 percent.",But a number of issues cloud GE’s outlook.

GE said settlement discussions with the DOJ in March and analysis of other banks’ reserves prompted it to take the charge, but it sees limited impact to results.","“We do not expect this to change our view on GE Capital with regards to cash and liquidity,” GE Chief Financial Officer Jamie Miller said on a conference call with analysts.","Excluding adjustments, GE earned $369 million, or 4 cents a share, on revenue of $28.7 billion. That compared with 1 cent a share a year ago.","While several analysts thought GE handily beat forecasts, others cited the unadjusted earnings as being more telling.","“I’m looking at it as coming in as expected,” analyst Jeff Windau at Edward Jones, said of the results and the adjustments. “And expectations were low.”","JPMorgan analyst Steve Tusa was among those who said GE may cut its full-year earnings forecast in coming months. While results were “not that bad” compared with other quarters, Tusa said, negative free cash flow of $1.68 billion was weaker than he expected. GE typically reports negative cash flow early in the year as it spends on inventory shipped later in the year.","GE earned an adjusted 16 cents per share, up from a restated 14 cents a share a year earlier.
