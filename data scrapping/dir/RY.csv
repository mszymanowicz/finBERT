Data for 2020 was not yet available.","RBC has made inroads into U.S. wealth management since its acquisition of Minneapolis-based brokerage and investment bank Dain Rauscher Wessels nearly two decades ago, which it combined with City National following its 2015 acquisition.","Overall U.S. wealth management client assets grew to $30.5 trillion in 2018, up 64% from 2010, according to a January report from McKinsey.","Stephen Biggar, an analyst at Argus Research, attributed RBC’s success in drawing teams from more entrenched players in the U.S. wealth management arena to its willingness to invest in growth.","“In some cases, there’s a bit of frustration with some of the larger firms,” he said. “If you want to grow a certain business, you have to spend ... RBC has gotten the return on that investment. That’s why they’ve not been in a cost-cutting mood.”","In July, Wells Fargo announced a broad cost-cutting initiative and UBS’s wealth management unit said in January it was axing as many as 500 jobs globally.",Armstrong noted that RBC had made important investments in technology and advisor platforms.,"RBC declined to disclose details about the investments, but said they were in the “tens of millions of dollars” and the amount was up three-fold in the last four years.","The company’s compensation is also “consistently very competitive,” said a spokeswoman for RBC’s U.S. wealth management unit, without providing details.","Production by financial advisors with high asset values is typically about 1% of assets under management, with compensation at 40% to 45% of that, said Jeff Testerman, managing partner at BrokerHunter.com, a financial services employment website.","The lure of compensation, however, could be a pitfall, said Patrick Kennedy, co-founder of PriceMetrix.","“If an advisor is likely to move once, they’re likely to move twice,” Kennedy said.","RBC Wealth Management’s U.S. assets under administration were up 7% to $436.4 billion as of the end of July, a touch below the record set in January. That compared with a 1% increase at Bank of America Corp’s wealth unit to $2.9 trillion and a 3.5% jump at Morgan Stanley to $2.7 trillion, the firms with the biggest wealth management units.","The United States accounts for 53% of RBC’s total wealth management client assets of C$1.1 trillion ($842 billion), versus Canada’s 38% share.","Wealth management has contributed about 19.6% of RBC’s total earnings this year, compared with 18.8% in 2019. RBC does not break down wealth management profits by region.","While the U.S. unit functions separately from its Canadian counterpart, the competitive recruiting is similar to what the bank has done in Canada for years, said Tony Maiorino, head of RBC Wealth Management’s Canadian unit in Toronto.","But Maiorino stressed the Canadian unit has been “very focused” on marrying investment management with wealth planning, by expanding offerings including tax, estate and succession planning to existing clients.","This has been the “largest contributor” to success in Canada, he said, while recruitment has been a major driver of U.S. growth.","“RBC is in a leading position in Canada and there’s less room to grow, so their focus there would be more on client retention,” said John Mackerey, senior vice president for North American financial institutions at DBRS Morningstar.","“They have greater room for expansion in the U.S., and a bigger runway to expand in a fragmented market.”"

Banks have been growing their business loan books at double-digit rates recently.","The Fed’s rate cut would weigh more on Canadian banks’ U.S. operations, Dechaine said in a note on Tuesday. Canadian banks experienced 43 basis points of average net interest margin compression following the Fed’s three rate cuts in 2019, he said.","Canadian banks' earnings could fall by between 0.6% to 1.5% in the next two quarters, with the more U.S.-focused TD Bank TD.TO and Bank of Montreal BMO.TO taking the biggest hits, he said."

Poloz said that while the bank did not know exactly where the economy was heading, that did not justify inaction.","“It does not mean keeping interest rates on hold until inflation momentum starts to build,” he said in a speech in Moncton, New Brunswick.","“The bank will continue to follow a gradual approach to raising interest rates, and remain dependent on incoming data and other sources of information to guide our decisions,” the governor added.","Market expectations of an interest rate hike in October, as reflected in the overnight index swaps market, rose slightly to 76.46 percent from 72.36 percent before the speech. [BOCWATCH]","Although the annual inflation rate in August was 2.8 percent, well above the bank’s 2.0 percent target, Poloz said that was partly due to the boost provided by temporary factors such as higher gas prices.","Poloz, who cited the inflation rate and very low unemployment, said in his speech that the economy was operating near capacity.","“We know that if we move too slowly to raise interest rates, the economy could move firmly above its capacity limits and inflation could establish significant momentum. We certainly want to avoid this outcome,” he said.","That said, new digital technologies could be giving the economy more room to grow before inflation pressure emerged.","“Raising interest rates too quickly could choke off this economic growth unnecessarily,” Poloz continued.","The bank left rates unchanged on Sept. 5 and Poloz said policy makers had pondered at the time whether the gradual approach to raising rates was still appropriate, given that its economic forecasts were on target.","The bank discussed whether the data coming in as planned “was a reason for more moving more quickly ... and our conclusion was no, we still have a number of uncertainties we are carrying,” he told a news conference after the speech.","One important unknown was the fate of talks to renegotiate NAFTA, he said. Talks on the pact have stalled.","Poloz earlier told his audience that if the North American Free Trade Agreement were successfully renewed, investment spending should pick up, and that would “give us a longer period of non-inflationary growth.”","Poloz - reiterating a point the bank made earlier this month - said if relations with the United States worsened and the economy slowed, that would not necessarily prompt a rate cut.","If for example, Washington carried through on a threat to impose tariffs on Canadian autos and Canada retaliated, prices would rise, and that could be “very risky” for the inflation outlook at a time when the economy was at capacity.","“If push comes to shove, our mandate is clear - it’s about inflation,” he said."
