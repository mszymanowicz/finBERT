28.90052259540854," Akzo Nobel concedes to PPG in battle over Finland's Tikkurila AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Dutch paints and coatings maker Akzo Nobel said on Monday it had given up its effort to buy Finnish peer Tikkurila, four days after U.S. rival PPG Industries had topped its bid. Akzo Nobel entered the race for Tikkurila last month with a 1.4 billion euros ($1.7 billion) bid, which at the time was 13% higher than the amount PPG offered. But PPG’s move last week to up its bid to 1.5 billion euros meant it no longer made sense for Akzo Nobel to stay in the race, Chief Executive Thierry Vanlancker said. “The intended acquisition of Tikkurila can no longer compete with more attractive opportunities to create value,” the CEO said in a statement. Akzo Nobel’s bid for the Finnish firm had been viewed by analysts as relatively high, although Vanlancker had said it was based on “rational” calculations. He denied suggestions that Akzo Nobel’s bid was mainly aimed at defending itself against PPG, which in 2017 dropped a $26.5 billion offer for Akzo after repeated rejections from the company and legal defeats.

The two industry heavyweights are seeking to tap into Tikkurila’s strong position in Finland, Sweden, the Baltics, Russia and Poland. “Today’s bid values Tikkurila ...well above both Akzo Nobel’s and PPG’s own multiples, highlighting the quality and importance of acquiring the asset,” Citi analysts said in a note. Tikkurila’s board has unanimously decided to recommend that the shareholders accept the PPG’s raised offer, which values the firm at 1.5 billion euros ($1.8 billion). Shares in Tikkurila were up 3.6% at 34.2 euros at 1031 GMT. Tikkurila said some major shareholders, holding 29.3% of its shares, have agreed to accept the offer if PPG gets regulatory approvals for the acquisition. PPG has lowered its acceptance rate for the offer to 66.7% of shares from its original 90% target. The battle for Tikkurila started in December with PPG’s 25 euros per share offer, which it raised to 27.75 euros after rival Hempel approached Tikkurila.

24.503969649719796," Dulux maker Akzo Nobel confirms 1.4 billion-euro bid for Tikkurila (Reuters) - Dutch paints and coatings maker Akzo Nobel on Thursday confirmed its 1.4 billion-euro ($1.7 billion) offer for Finland’s Tikkurila, after beating a U.S. rival’s offer last week. The Dulux paint maker stuck to the 31.25 euro per share non-binding proposal it made last week, topping Pittsburgh-based PPG’s earlier offer by 13%. Tikkurila responded by saying it will consider Akzo’s offer. In a statement, Akzo said that “clear synergies would be created from collective procurement capabilities, expanded production, and combined sales and distribution channels.” Analysts have questioned the timing of Akzo’s offer, saying it could be caught in a bidding war. “We think Akzo is the natural acquiror given business overlap with Tikkurila and should be able to pay a higher price than PPG due to higher potential synergies,” said Morningstar analyst Rob Hales, adding it would probably come down to how badly PPG wants the deal. The Amsterdam-based firm, which said it does not currently hold any shares in the company, would expect to complete the deal this year. ($1 = 0.8247 euro)"
16.829733518244982," Breakingviews - Akzo’s Finnish paint splurge is no Rembrandt LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - To most people, “the Netherlands” and “paint” means Rubens, Rembrandt or Vincent van Gogh. In looking to splurge 1.4 billion euros on Finnish coatings peer Tikkurila, aggressively crashing U.S. rival PPG Industries’s planned takeover, Amsterdam-listed Akzo Nobel is displaying little of the grace or finesse of the Dutch masters. Akzo Nobel’s 31.25 euros per share offer for Tikkurila, which enjoys a strong position in the Nordic market for decorative paints and coatings, is a full 13% higher than the 27.75 euros that PPG unveiled two weeks ago. The two combatants have history: in 2017 Akzo thwarted the Pittsburgh-based group’s attempt to buy it by enlisting the support of unions and the Dutch government. Akzo Nobel Chief Executive Thierry Vanlancker will struggle to depict such generosity to Tikkurila shareholders in a favourable light. His offer values the Finnish firm at some 16 times 2021 EBITDA, according to Refinitiv forecasts. His own company, worth 17 billion euros, trades on just 11 times. Nor do Tikkurila’s prospects justify a headier valuation: its earnings are barely expected to grow over the next four years, Refinitiv data shows. Tikkurila is likely to generate 62 million euros of operating profit next year, according to Refinitiv estimates. After deducting tax, that would represent a 4% return on Akzo’s 1.4 billion euro outlay, far below the 5% weighted average cost of capital estimated by New York University Stern for the European speciality chemicals sector. The Dutch group has so far failed to outline any synergies, and likely divestments will reduce potential savings. It’s possible Vanlancker is trying to bulk up to prevent another assault by $34 billion PPG. In that regard, the 2% decline in Akzo’s share price on Monday – lopping off 340 million euros of market value – is counter-productive. However, his move could work out if PPG is lured into making an even bigger mistake. Tikkurila shares leapt 17% to 32 euros on Monday, suggesting investors think the U.S. group may yet raise its price. That could irritate its shareholders, and leave CEO Michael McGarry tied up with an expensive transatlantic acquisition. Vanlancker’s messy splurge may yet become a masterstroke."
16.829733518244982," Akzo Nobel takes on PPG in battle to buy Finland's Tikkurila AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Dutch paints and coatings maker Akzo Nobel locked horns with U.S. rival PPG Industries again on Monday, making a $1.7 billion counterbid for Finland’s Tikkurila. Akzo said it was willing to pay 31.25 euros per outstanding share, valuing Tikkurila at 1.4 billion euros, exceeding the 1.2 billion euros offered by PPG two weeks ago. It invited the Finnish company’s board, which had already agreed to PPG’s offer, to enter talks. Relations between the Dutch and American firms soured in 2017 when PPG made an unsuccessful attempt to buy Akzo for $26.5 billion. Investors in Tikkurila were not convinced that Akzo’s non-binding bid would immediately end the battle, as its share price soared 17% to 32.60 euros ($39.33), well above Akzo’s offer. Tikkurila said in a statement it would take Akzo’s offer into consideration, while under the terms of their agreement PPG would first get the opportunity to raise its bid. PPG could not immediately be reached for comment. Akzo shares were 2% lower in Amsterdam, as ING analysts said its current bid was already relatively high and warned of the risk of a bidding war over Tikkurila. Thierry Vanlancker, Akzo Chief Executive, said he had made a “rational bid” which was aimed at strengthening Akzo’s position in the region and not at defending itself against PPG. “This is an offer that we make very much with a calculator in hand. In any subsequent steps we will continue to be as rational as we have been before,” Vanlancker added. PPG increased its original bid on Jan. 5 after Tikkurila said it had received a competing offer, which the Finnish company on Monday revealed had come from Danish peer Hempel. “The timing was we were now ready to do it, and given what was on the table it was also time to do it now,” Vanlancker said, adding it was a rare opportunity. “If a farmer sees his neighbour is selling his land, he will always have a look,” the CEO added. Akzo said it would sell assets, including its decorative paints business in the Nordics and Baltics to Hempel after closing of the deal, in order to obtain regulatory approval.

The bid would come three months after Axalta said it would explore a sale. It would allow PPG to overcome potential antitrust hurdles it would face were it to buy the entirety of Axalta, and only take on businesses it deems complementary. CD&R and PPG are discussing forming a consortium to bid for Axalta with other investors that include Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC and U.S. asset manager BlackRock Inc, one of the sources said. Other private equity firms are also interested in Axalta, which has a market capitalization of $7.3 billion and long-term debt of close to $4 billion, three sources said. Some of them have also been looking for partners. Buyout firm Platinum Equity LLC, for example, has been in talks about partnering with Koch Industries Inc on a bid for Axalta, one of the sources said, cautioning that it is possible such a bid does not materialize. The auction process for Axalta is ongoing and there is no certainty any deal will be reached, the sources said, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Axalta, PPG, CD&R and Platinum Equity declined to comment. GIC, BlackRock and Koch Industries did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Axalta’s coatings are used in the refinishing of cars, buildings and pipelines. Its corporate peers include Sherwin-Williams Co, Akzo Nobel NV, BASF SE and RPM International Inc. Axalta rebuffed acquisition approaches in 2017 from Akzo Nobel and Nippon Paint Holdings Co Ltd. PPG is currently on an acquisition spree, snapping up smaller coatings companies. Axalta also got new management in December, following an investigation of previous Chief Executive Officer Terrence Hahn’s conduct by external counsel that Axalta characterized as “inconsistent with the company’s policies.” Axalta never disclosed the investigation’s findings. Hahn was replaced with the company’s chief financial officer, Robert Bryant. Berkshire Hathaway had a 10.4% stake in Axalta as of the end of June. An activist hedge fund, Jana Partners LLC, is also an Axalta shareholder, with a 2.5% stake as of the end of June, according to regulatory filings."

0.23678062592031993," Trian calls for PPG Industries CEO ouster, wants to split company (Reuters) - Activist hedge fund Trian Fund Management said on Thursday that it wants to replace PPG Industries' PPG.N chief executive with his predecessor and suggested that the U.S. paints and coatings company be broken up. Trian, which now owns 2.9 percent of PPG, said in a presentation at an investment conference that it urged PPG to bring back Chuck Bunch as chief executive to replace Michael McGarry, who is currently chairman and CEO. Since Bunch left in 2015, PPG has underperformed, Trian said. Trian pointed to PPG’s Oct. 8 profit warning and restatement of financial statements because of accounting irregularities as evidence of problems at the company. PPG earlier on Thursday issued a strong defense of its CEO saying that the board unanimously backed McGarry. Trian wants the company to break itself into two separate and publicly traded companies, which it said would eventually allow room for more strategic acquisitions in the future. A separation could unlock “an additional 15 percent to 40 percent of shareholder value,” Ed Garden, Trian’s chief investment officer and a founding partner, said at the conference where he spoke about the investment in detail. Trian, co-founded by Nelson Peltz, said two weeks ago it now holds 7 million shares of PPG. PPG shares were trading up 3.12 percent at $100.79 on Thursday, but are still down 16.74 percent since the start of the year. Trian's largest investments are General Electric Co. GE.N and Procter & Gamble PG.N, where the firm has board seats. Trian's main fund returned 1.7 percent in the first nine months of the year, an investor in the fund said. Trian’s public push to oust McGarry is highly unusual for a firm that has put a premium on saying it works collaboratively with target companies and largely tries to stay out of the headlines. But “after three years of significant underperformance driven by operating and strategic mishaps, we believe change is warranted and now is the right time to bring back Chuck Bunch,” Trian said in a statement. Trian also wants to eliminate the company’s practice of re-electing only a portion of its board instead of the entire group every year, saying such a step would bring it in line with other large U.S. companies. PPG said in a statement it believes its strategic plan has positioned the company for growth. “We have emphasized returning cash to shareholders, dedicating about 65 percent of our cash deployment in 2016 and 2017 to dividends and share repurchases - $2.7 billion in total - with an additional $1.6 billion through the first three quarters of 2018.” The company said they would be open to listen to Trian on other topics."
