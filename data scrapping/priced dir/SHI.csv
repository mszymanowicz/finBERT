0.42134829488069714," Sinopec Shanghai Petchem to raise second-half crude throughput BEIJING (Reuters) - Sinopec Shanghai Petrochemical, a refining subsidiary of Asia’s top refiner Sinopec, plans to raise daily crude oil throughput by 7.8% in the second half of 2020. The Chinese company aims to process 7.68 million tonnes of crude oil in July-December, equivalent to 304,700 barrels per day, a company official said at a briefing on Thursday. That compares to 7.02 million tonnes of crude oil in the first half of 2020, which was down 6.1% from the same period last year due to the coronavirus outbreak and refinery overhaul. The firm has annual crude refining capacity of 16 million tonnes. That indicates Sinopec Shanghai would still lag behind its 2020 crude oil throughput target of 15.3 million tonnes. Shanghai Petchem recorded a net loss of 1.7 billion yuan ($247.10 million) in the first half of 2020 based on Chinese accounting standards, as the coronavirus pandemic dampened fuel demand, according to company statements filed with the Shanghai Stocks Exchange. “The coronavirus outbreak had brought huge pressure on our production and operation in the first half of 2020...We were forced to cut crude throughput...and we were just able to ease inventory pressure since May,” said Huang Fei, a vice general manager at Shanghai Petchem at the briefing. Huang also said the coronavirus crisis had forced the company to cut fuel exports in the second quarter. However, the group’s average crude oil refining cost in the first six months of 2020 fell 17.9% year-on-year to 2,717 yuan per tonne, or around $54 per barrel, thanks to the decades-low oil prices. Shanghai Petchem bought around 84% of its crude oil from the middle east and around 10% from Latin American countries in January-June. It plans to maintain a full-load refining operation in the second half of this year, in particular increasing production of low sulphur marine fuel. “We are confident of turning losses into gains in the second half and posting a full-year profit,” said Guan Zeming, general manager of Shanghai Petchem.

20.454541639770156," UPDATE 1-Vietnam's Dung Quat refinery may delay maintenance to 2021 due to coronavirus (Adds details and background) HANOI, April 6 (Reuters) - Vietnam’s Binh Son Refining and Petrochemical Co will likely delay maintenance at its Dung Quat refinery, scheduled to begin on June 12, due to the coronavirus pandemic that has led to travel curbs, two sources familiar with the matter said on Monday. “We have difficulties shipping needed equipment to Vietnam and travel bans will make it difficult for foreign contractors to send their workers to the refinery,” one of the sources said, adding the maintenance may be delayed until 2021. A trader, however, said it might be delayed until the second half of this year. Binh Son declined to comment. The company said in a statement over the weekend that 35% of the maintenance work would be handled by foreign contractors and 65% by domestic ones. It said in January it had signed deals with seven contractors for the maintenance. “Binh Son is monitoring the COVID-19 situation in Vietnam and (will) keep updating with the contractors to make appropriate changes to the maintenance plan,” the statement said. The 130,000-barrel-per-day refinery said on Friday it would cut output as domestic demand for refined fuels had fallen 30%-40% since February, adding it may have to cease production “if demand continues to decline”. Vietnam has reported 241 coronavirus cases as of late Monday, with no reported deaths, the Ministry of Health said.

-6.779038055621835," Vietnam signs crude oil supply deal for 2020 with SOCAR HANOI, Nov 30 (Reuters) - Vietnam’s state-run Binh Son Refining and Petrochemical Co (BSR) has inked an agreement with Azeri state energy company SOCAR to buy five million barrels of crude in 2020, BSR said late on Friday. SOCAR Trading will provide five million barrels of Azeri Light crude to BSR’s Dung Quat refinery during the first half of 2020, BSR said in a statement on its web site. The company said Azeri crude would also become one of its strategic crude oil products from 2020, following Vietnam’s abolishment of an import tax on crude oil which took effect from November. Earlier this week, BSR said it would import 8 million to 10 million barrels of West Texas Intermediate and Bonny Light crude oil in 2020 for its Dung Quat refinery. Vietnam has been relying more on imported crude due to a slowdown in domestic output as reserves at its existing fields decline, and as China’s increasingly assertive stance in the region hampers offshore exploration. The country’s crude oil imports during the first 11 months of this year rose 66% from a year earlier to 7.44 million tonnes (54.54 million barrels), government data released on Friday showed.
