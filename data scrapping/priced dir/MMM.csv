Its home improvement products ScotchBlue painter tapes and Filtrete room air purifiers also gained traction, as people stayed home during the health crisis.

16.912775637228414," 3M profit beats on healthcare boost; says demand for N95 masks to continue (Reuters) - U.S. industrial conglomerate 3M Co topped Wall Street estimates for third-quarter profit and revenue on Tuesday, as the maker of N95 masks benefited from robust demand for its healthcare products during the COVID-19 pandemic. Demand for 3M’s disposable respirators is expected to continue in the fourth quarter, company executives said on a post-earnings call, adding that 3M was on track to produce 2 billion N95 masks this year. Sales from three of the company’s four main businesses rose, with the healthcare unit recording a 25.5% jump and accounting for more than a quarter of the company’s total sales. Sales at 3M’s biggest unit, safety and industrial, rose 6.9%, helped by a sequential pick up in automotive aftermarket demand as auto body shops reopened after the economic shutdown in the second quarter. Revenue from the transportation and electronics unit, which makes everything from computer screen filters to auto parts, fell 7.4% as the pandemic continued to have a negative impact on end markets such as hospitality, oil and gas and advertising due to social distancing and work from home. The company forecast full-year capital expenditure to be between $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion, compared with its previous forecast of about $1.4 billion. However, 3M declined to provide any other forecast for 2020, citing uncertainty due to the pandemic. Net income attributable to 3M fell to $1.41 billion, or $2.43 per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, as operating expenses rose nearly 8%. Net sales rose 4.5% to $8.35 billion.

Ottawa and the province of Ontario decided to invest C$23 million ($17.5 million) each to expand the facility after experiencing serious problems as they tried to stock up on foreign-made personal protective equipment (PPE) for health care workers in the first weeks of the outbreak. “We were left in a terrible, terrible situation ... and the terrifying reality is, at one point back in April, Ontario was left with less one week’s supply of N95 masks,” Premier Doug Ford told reporters. “I promised the people of Ontario that we would never, ever again be left at the mercy of other countries for this critical PPE,” Ford spoke at the plant in Brockville, a town about 110 km (70 miles) south of Ottawa. Starting next year it will produce 25 million masks for the federal government and another 25 million for Ontario. In April, Ford complained the United States had blocked the export of more than 3 million face masks Ontario had bought. Canada has reported 123,873 total cases and 9,054 deaths. Ontario accounts for the 31% of the death toll. Federal Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the plant would help “ensure we have the capacity to make whatever we need, here in our own communities” and could one day export masks.

However, demand for the wide range of office and industrial supplies it churns out has declined as global economic activity sank and millions of employees retreated to working from home. “3M is not immune to a slowing economy,” said Matt Arnold, industrial analyst at brokerage Edward Jones. “We expect a negative near-term impact on earnings from the shutdowns related to the outbreak”. The company again declined to provide a financial forecast, citing uncertainty around the pandemic. Revenue at 3M’s transportation and electronics division, which sells everything from protective films to adhesives to automakers, tumbled 20.9%. Demand for oral care and aerospace products also declined, with overall second-quarter net sales falling slightly more than expected to $7.2 billion from $8.2 billion. Reflecting the boom in mask sales, 3M reported strong growth in personal safety, as well as in automotive electronics, and home care and improvement. It said it was on track to meet a promise to double production of the N95 masks to 2 billion for the year, having sold some 800 million so far. By region, sales in Asia-Pacific fell 8.5%, while Europe, Middle East and Africa posted declines of 16.4%. Sales in the United States decreased 12.7%. Operating expenses fell 16% to $5.4 billion, as 3M cut $400 million in costs. On an adjusted basis, the maker of Post-it notes earned $1.78 per share, just short of analysts’ estimate of $1.80."

The test would produce results within minutes and could be administered on a low-cost, paper-based device, similar to a home pregnancy test, that could be delivered at the point of care. “We are seeking to improve the speed, accessibility and affordability of testing for the virus, a major step in helping to prevent its spread,” said John Banovetz, the chief technology officer at 3M. The research effort is being aided by a grant from the National Institutes of Health, which is running a project called Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx) that funds the development of new testing technologies in academia and business. The program aims to have the new tests available for use by late summer or early fall. Antigen tests scan for proteins that can be found on or inside a virus. They can detect the virus very quickly and can potentially be produced at a lower cost than other tests. 3M says it could scale manufacturing to millions of tests per day once it is developed."

8.75318811653658," Used car dealer charged with price gouging New York City on 3M's N95 masks NEW YORK (Reuters) - A New Jersey used car dealer was criminally charged on Tuesday with exploiting the coronavirus pandemic by trying to defraud and price gouge New York City into buying N95 respirator masks in a roughly $45 million scheme. The U.S. Department of Justice said Ronald Romano, 58, sought quick riches in late March when his Performance Supply LLC tried to sell 7 million of the 3M-branded masks to New York City’s Office of Citywide Procurement for about 500% above the typical list price. Prosecutors said the Manalapan, New Jersey, resident created a bogus letter falsely showing that 3M Co MMM.N authorized the sale. He was also accused of offering to sell 3 million Mexican-made N99 face masks to Florida’s Division of Emergency Management for $5.46 million, a more than 500% markup. Prosecutors said Romano’s intentions were clear from a March 9 text to an accomplice: “I’m working on a few deals that if I get any of them you might be buying a Ferrari.” They also said that after being warned on March 31 the FBI might investigate suspected price gouging, Romano responded: “I thought we are a free market of supply and demand?” Mark Macron, a lawyer for Romano, declined immediate comment. Romano faces wire fraud and two conspiracy charges. Two counts carry maximum 30-year prison terms. Bail was set at $200,000 in an afternoon teleconference. “Ronald Romano saw the current health emergency as an opportunity to cash in,” U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman in Manhattan said in a statement. “Now Ronald Romano’s short-lived second career as a purveyor of vital protective gear is over.” 3M, the world’s largest maker of N95 masks, on May 4 won an injunction against Performance Supply’s sale of them. The St. Paul, Minnesota-based company has filed at least 10 similar lawsuits. William Childs, a 3M senior counsel, said the company was happy to see law enforcement’s continued involvement."

U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska in Manhattan on Monday blocked Performance Supply LLC of Englishtown, New Jersey from using 3M’s name and logo, or posing as an authorized 3M distributor, to help sell masks. 3M, based in St. Paul, Minnesota, is the world’s largest maker of N95 masks, which are designed to filter 95% of airborne particles. It said it sued after learning that Performance Supply tried to sell 7 million masks to New York City’s Office of Citywide Procurement for $43.85 million, or an average $6.26 each, according to its invoice. 3M said the markup was roughly five times its list prices of $1.02 to $1.31 per mask, depending on the model, and amounted to “extreme” price gouging. Performance Supply could not immediately be reached on Tuesday for comment. 3M has filed at least 10 similar lawsuits in several courts, and the preliminary injunction is its first. “The goal from the start has been to try to get rid of ‘static’ in the system so that procurement officers don’t have to sort through misleading offers, and we can get our respirators where they need to be,” William Childs, a senior counsel at 3M, said in an interview. Judge Preska said Performance Supply’s conduct would likely irreparably harm 3M’s reputation if it continued. She also said an injunction served the public interest, and governments, hospitals and other healthcare providers should not have to squander resources to investigate the masks’ origins. “When lives are at stake and time is of the essence, as is clearly the case in this crisis, the public interest demands accountability,” Preska wrote. New York City is part of the epicenter for the pandemic within the United States. 3M in January doubled its annual production rate of N95 masks to 1.1 billion. Chief Executive Mike Roman said last week that the company is working with the U.S. Department of Defense to boost annual production to 2 billion by year end."

The worldwide lockdowns, however, are hammering other parts of its business, and it reported fall in revenue at its all units except healthcare and consumer. “We believe Q2 results will be especially challenged given the trends we have seen so far in April,” CEO Michael Roman said on a post-earnings call.

The company now expects 2020 capex to be about $1.3 billion compared to its prior estimate of $1.6 billion to $1.8 billion. Beginning May, 3M said it would begin reporting monthly sales information to provide transparency on its ongoing business performance as it navigates the pandemic. First-quarter sales rose 2.7% to $8.08 billion beating market expectations of $7.91 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. In January the company said it was doubling its global output of N95 masks, designed to filter 95% of airborne particles, to 1.1 billion annually. Under White House pressure, 3M also reached an agreement this month to import 166.5 million N95 respirators to the United States from China and allow it to continue exporting its U.S.-made respirators. U.S. sales rose 10.1%, while Asia-Pacific sales fell 5.4%, and Europe, Middle East and Africa reported declines of 2.1%. 3M’s key market, China, reported a contraction in its economy for the first time on record as the coronavirus shut down factories and malls and put millions out of work.

Trudeau said on Saturday that he expected to speak with Trump in the coming days and that Canadian officials were having “very constructive” discussions with the U.S. administration. “We are not looking at retaliatory measures or measures that are punitive,” he said in his daily address in Ottawa. “We know it is in both of our interests to work collaboratively and cooperatively to keep our citizens safe. “That’s very much the tenor of our conversations and I’m confident that we’re going to get there.” Trump has asked 3M to ramp up imports of masks to the U.S. from other global manufacturing facilities, while demanding a pause in exports of domestically-produced respirators to Canada and some Latin American countries. Trudeau said a chartered air shipment of millions of masks was due to arrive in Canada in the next 48 hours. Canada is also increasing domestic production of personal protective equipment, he said. Some Canadian health professionals living along the U.S. border work at U.S. hospitals, and Trudeau said Canada was making no move to stop that practice.

Trudeau defended Canada’s coronavirus testing program, saying it had done more than the United States. Early testing in the western provinces of British Columbia and Alberta had proven “very effective” at managing the coronavirus spread, Trudeau said.

18.5421646988103," Canada blasts U.S. block on 3M exports of masks as coronavirus cases set to soar OTTAWA/TORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian officials on Friday blasted a move by President Donald Trump to block 3M Co’s export of N95 respirator masks for use by doctors and nurses as coronavirus cases were projected to soar in the country’s most populous region. Ontario health officials projected 80,000 coronavirus cases and 1,600 deaths in the province by month end under current public health measures, and urged people to restrict their movements. Ontario has reported 3,255 confirmed cases and 67 deaths. Late Thursday, Trump slammed 3M in a tweet after earlier invoking the Defense Production Act to get the company to produce protective face masks. N95 masks, essential for protecting healthcare professionals from breathing in the coronavirus, are in short supply. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said blocking the flow of medical supplies across the border would be a “mistake.” He said such a move could backfire, and he noted that Canadian healthcare professionals go to the United States to work in Detroit every day. Canada and the United States closed their common border to all non-essential traffic earlier this month. Asked whether Canada would retaliate if the U.S. blockade goes ahead, Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said Ottawa would “do whatever it takes to defend the national interest.” 3M said on Friday it would boost respirator production and import more masks into the United States, and it warned that blocking exports could result in retaliation by other countries that could ultimately reduce the amount of equipment available. Deaths surged to 208 from 127 on Thursday while positive cases rose to 12,375 from 10,132, according to provincial announcements compiled by the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. Ontario Premier Doug said on Friday he had spoken to U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer about the Trump administration move to block 3M exports of masks. “The health and well-being of our frontline workers depend on these essential medical items and now more than ever our countries need to work together to combat COVID-19,” Ford said on Twitter. On Friday Ontario halted all industrial construction, except for critical projects, and banned new residential construction to limit social contact. Separately, Trudeau said Amazon Canada will manage the distribution of personal protection equipment to the provinces. Trudeau said Quebec has requested that the Canadian Armed Forces be sent to northern communities to assist isolated and remote communities in managing the coronavirus outbreak.

18.5421646988103," Trump says 3M 'will have a big price to pay' over face masks WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump slammed 3M Co MMM.N in a tweet late on Thursday after earlier announcing he was invoking the Defense Production Act to get the company to produce face masks. “We hit 3M hard today after seeing what they were doing with their Masks. ‘P Act’ all the way.’ Big surprise to many in government as to what they were doing - will have a big price to pay!” Trump said on Twitter. At a White House briefing on the coronavirus pandemic earlier on Thursday, Trump announced he had signed a Defense Production Act order for 3M to produce face masks. “Hopefully they’ll be able to do what they are supposed to do,” he said, without elaborating. St. Paul, Minnesota-based 3M did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company’s brands include Scotch, Post-It and Nexcare, as well as healthcare products for professionals. White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said at the briefing, “We’ve had some issues making sure that all of the production that 3M does around the world, enough of it is coming back here to the right places.” The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the president’s tweet. N-95 face masks made by 3M and other companies are in short supply among healthcare workers treating coronavirus patients. The Defense Production Act, which was passed in 1950, grants the president the power to expand industrial production of key materials or products for national security and other reasons. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is expected to issue guidelines in the next few days that could tell Americans to wear face masks when leaving home."
18.5421646988103," 3M warns against Trump's order to limit face mask exports (Reuters) - 3M Co MMM.N said on Friday it would make more face masks for the United States to fight the coronavirus pandemic, but warned of the ""humanitarian implications"" of limiting supply to other countries as President Donald Trump directed. Trump has asked 3M to ramp up imports of the masks to the U.S. from its other global manufacturing facilities, while demanding a pause in the exports of domestically-produced respirators to Canada and some Latin American countries. (bit.ly/3dLDUfT) “There are, however, significant humanitarian implications of ceasing respirator supplies to healthcare workers in Canada and Latin America, where we are a critical supplier of respirators,” the company said in a statement. 3M said such a move was likely to cause other countries to retaliate as the N-95 face masks made by 3M and other companies are in short supply among healthcare workers treating coronavirus patients. “If that were to occur, the net number of respirators being made available to the United States would actually decrease.” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said blocking 3M’s export of respirators could backfire, adding that thousands of nurses cross the border to work in Detroit every day. 3M’s response comes a day after Trump slammed the 117-year-old industrial giant in a tweet regarding their mask supply and invoked the Defense Production Act to get the company to produce more respirators. 3M “will have a big price to pay,” he had said, without elaborating. [nL1N2BR01X] The Defense Production Act, which was passed in 1950, grants the president the power to expand industrial production of key materials or products for national security and other reasons.

The company said on Friday it has secured China’s approval to export to the U.S. 10 million N-95 respirators manufactured by the company in China.

15.403404021198169," 3M to boost U.S. production of respirator masks to 50 million as demand soars (Reuters) - 3M Co expects to ramp up U.S. monthly production of N95 respirator masks to 50 million in June, the industrial giant said on Tuesday, as demand surges from healthcare professionals and first responders battling the coronavirus pandemic. The company is also looking to produce 2 billion N95 respirators globally within the next year, again doubling capacity to produce the masks designed to filter 95% of airborne particles. With medical facilities running low on ventilators and protective masks and hampered by limited diagnostic testing capacity, the outbreak has led to the deaths of over 2,800 Americans and infected over 160,000 as of Tuesday, surpassing the case counts of China and Italy. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has said that over the next 18 months it aims to buy 500 million masks for the Strategic National Stockpile, the nation’s supply of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies. 3M said it was working with several sterilization companies to find a way for hospitals to safely clean, reuse and extend the life of the respirators. The company also plans to boost production of its air-purifying respirators by six-fold within the next 60 to 90 days through its partnership with Ford Motor Co. U.S. companies are rushing to manufacture ventilators and masks as the outbreak spreads. Ford has said it will produce 50,000 ventilators over the next 100 days at a plant in Michigan in cooperation with General Electric’s healthcare unit, while larger rival GM plans to produce up to 10,000 ventilators a month by this summer at a plant in Kokomo, Indiana."

15.830121311421077," CORRECTED-UPDATE 2-Ford joins 3M, GE in speeding up ventilator, respirator production (Corrects company name to “Ventec” from “Ventecis” in paragraph 9) March 24 (Reuters) - Carmaker Ford Motor Co on Tuesday jumped into the emergency push by major U.S. manufacturers to produce thousands of ventilators and respirators needed for critically ill coronavirus patients. By joining forces with General Electric’s healthcare unit and 3M Co, Ford is taking heed of U.S. President Donald Trump’s call for U.S. automakers to work across sectors in producing equipment needed for the pandemic. The rapid outbreak, which has killed more than 16,500 people globally, has strained healthcare systems around the world and led to a shortage of ventilators needed to treat patients suffering from the flu-like illness, which can lead to breathing difficulties and pneumonia in severe cases. “We’ve been in regular dialogue with federal, state and local officials to understand the areas of greatest needs,” Ford Chief Executive Jim Hackett said, adding that the company’s aim was to increase the supply on necessary medical equipment. Ford and GE Healthcare will expand the production of GE’s ventilator design to support patients with respiratory failure or difficulty breathing caused by the pathogen, Ford said. Separately, Ford will work with 3M to increase manufacturing capacity of its air-purifying respirators to meet a surge in demand for first responders and healthcare workers. The company said it was exploring how it could produce these new respirators in one of its Michigan manufacturing plants and help 3M boost production ten-fold. It would use fans from its Ford F-150 cooled seats to make parts of the respirators, the company said. Additionally, Ford said its U.S. design team was starting to test transparent full-face shields for first responders, which when paired with N95 respirator masks, could be an effective way of limiting exposure to the coronavirus. General Motors Co has also partnered with medical equipment maker Ventec and is building ventilators at its plant in Indiana. Meanwhile, Fiat Chrysler Automobile NV, told employees in an email that the Italian-American automaker would start converting one of its China plants to ultimately make over 1 million masks a month to help combat the coronavirus outbreak.

The company also decided to invest more to expand the global capacity by 30% in next 12 months. With 400 million face masks produced a year in the United States, 3M is one of the biggest producers in the United States. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services had earlier this month said that over the next 18 months it aims to buy 500 million masks for the Strategic National Stockpile, the nation’s supply of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies.

11.663964876090484," 3M taps regional suppliers to meet soaring demand for masks MAPLEWOOD, Minn. (Reuters) - Diversified manufacturer 3M Co MMM.N has avoided major supply chain disruptions from the coronavirus outbreak by sourcing materials for its protective face masks from regional suppliers instead of far-flung locations, a company official told Reuters. More than 3,200 people have died from the fast-spreading coronavirus, which has reached more than 80 nations. It has spurred buying sprees on medical supplies like face masks, even as world health officials have warned that citizens generally do not need to buy such supplies, and that stockpiling by the public can put healthcare workers, who do need them, at risk. 3M has ramped up testing and production of single-use N95 respirator masks, designed to filter 95% of airborne particles, along with more robust respiratory protective gear amid the coronavirus outbreak. So far, the company has not seen disruptions in production, Nikki McCullough, global lead for occupational health and safety at 3M, told Reuters at its global testing lab outside of Minneapolis, “If we start to see disruptions, we’ll certainly work to alert our customers. At this point in time, we are able to manufacture and we are continuing at capacity for respirators,” she said. U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, who is heading the coronavirus response team in the United States, said on Sunday that the U.S. government is seeking 35 million additional masks per month from 3M. Pence will visit the 3M facility on Thursday. 3M produces all of the components of the filters in its N95 respirator masks in house but sources other materials from regional suppliers, including the straps and metal nose clips that hold the masks in pace, McCullough said. “Since we have this regional manufacturing model, many of our items are coming regionally. And we’re working with our supply partners very closely to monitor the situation,” McCullough told Reuters. The company is not currently under contract to produce the masks and is preparing to respond to the government’s request, 3M spokeswoman Jennifer Ehrlich said. Demand for masks like the ones produced by 3M has outpaced supply as the coronavirus outbreak, which originated in China, has spread. The outbreak has riled markets and disrupted global supply chains, largely in export-dependent China. “The demand is outstripping capacity right now, and we’re working 24/7 to ramp up and be able to meet as much of that demand as we can,” CEO Michael Roman told investors at an industry conference last month. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services intends to buy 500 million N95 respirators over the next 18 months for the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS), the nation’s supply of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies."

-3.951402445520888," 3M forecasts 2020 profit below estimates on weak China demand (Reuters) - U.S. industrial giant 3M Co MMM.N forecast 2020 profit below expectations after narrowly missing quarterly revenue estimates on Tuesday as weak demand from China dents overall growth. Shares of the company, which draws a third of its revenue from Asia, fell 4.2% and were the biggest drag on the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI in morning trading. Sales in Asia-Pacific region, its largest market outside the United States, fell for the fifth straight quarter, weighed by softness in China’s automotive and electronics sectors, a reason that had forced 3M to cut jobs and production last year. The company said it would cut 1,500 jobs as it continues to restructure its businesses and reduce costs. China, the world’s second largest economy, grew at its slowest pace in almost three decades in 2019 amid a trade war that hit factory production, while auto sales slumped for the 18th straight month. “We were looking at a sluggish start to China in first quarter...based on automotive, and the build rate’s expected to be down mid-single digits and maybe even high single digits,” Chief Executive Officer Michael Roman said in an post earnings call. Executives, however, said the company was ramping up production of its respiratory protection products to match global demand arising from coronavirus outbreak in China. Asia-Pacific sales were down 1.7%, while Europe, Middle East and Africa reported a decline of 2%. Sales in the United States rose 7.4%. “We expect investors to generally be disappointed with the print, guidance and the new PFAS-related charges, while rapidly advancing Coronavirus concerns ultimately could pull the rug out from under the Asia recovery story,” Gordon Haskett analyst John Inch said. 3M recorded a $214 million writedown for litigation related to PFAS chemicals. Sales at its healthcare unit, which accounted for 25% to total revenue, rose about 25.4% on strength in international markets. 3M said it expects 2020 earnings per share to be between $9.30 and $9.75, the midpoint of which was below analysts’ average estimate of $9.61 per share. Net income attributable to 3M fell 28% to $969 million, largely due to restructuring and litigation charges. On an adjusted basis, it earned $2.15 per share, beating expectations of $2.10, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Net sales fell 2.1% to $8.11 billion and missed expectations of $8.12 billion.

10.996569751541116," 3M cuts profit forecast after sales miss on slowing Asia demand (Reuters) - 3M Co MMM.N on Thursday became the latest U.S manufacturer to signal American corporations are suffering from the trade war with China, after it reported quarterly revenue well short of Wall Street estimates and cut its full-year profit forecast. Shares of the company, which gets nearly a third of its annual sales from Asia, fell as much as 5.4%. The stock is the third biggest percentage loser on the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI this year to Wednesday, with an 11% drop. China was the worst performing market, the company said, with sales plunging 9% excluding the impact of currency changes. The world’s second largest economy expanded at its weakest pace in almost three decades in the third-quarter as the bruising trade war hit factory production, with auto sales slumping for the 15th straight month in September. This squeezed demand for 3M’s automotive products such as sound absorption materials and thermal insulation pads used in batteries. So far this week, industrial bellwether Caterpillar Inc CAT.N reported weak demand in Asia, including a 29% plunge in construction equipment sales, while toymaker Hasbro Inc HAS.O highlighted a hit from the tit-for-tat tariffs. Overall, 3M’s sales in Asia-Pacific, its biggest market outside the United States, fell 5%. In the United States adjusted sales dropped 1.1% and also came in below the expectations of some analysts. “We’re seeing a broader impact on industrial production, broader manufacturing,” in the United States due to the slowing economic growth, said Chief Executive Officer Mike Roman. 3M, known for Scotch tape and Post-it notes, earlier this year announced plans to reduce production and cut 2,000 workers as its sales slowed. “We believe investors anticipated a weak quarter and guide down. Operationally, this appears worse,” Gordon Haskett analyst John Inch wrote in a note. 3M lowered its full-year adjusted earnings expectations to be between $8.99 and $9.09 per share, down from its prior outlook of $9.25 to $9.75. Net income attributable to the company rose to $1.58 billion, or $2.75 per share, in the quarter, from $1.54 billion, or $2.64 per share, a year earlier, helped by a divestment gain. Net sales fell 2% to $7.99 billion, missing the average analyst estimate of $8.16 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv."

-5.905924951051478," 3M profit beats as strength in healthcare helps battle slowing China (Reuters) - 3M Co's MMM.N quarterly profit beat estimates on Thursday as the company's efforts to bolster its healthcare business helped it counter sluggish demand in its traditional industrial and transportation units due to a slowdown in China. Revenue fell at all but the diversified manufacturer’s healthcare unit, where it rose about 6% on strength in both domestic and international markets. The company’s healthcare unit sells everything from surgical tapes to sterilization products and accounted for about 22% of its total revenue in the quarter. 3M bought surgical wound-care company Acelity Inc in May to expand its medical dressings products. The Post-It maker said the healthcare business is now expected to grow at the high end of its 2% to 4% forecast range. “We talked about (healthcare) having a good quarter, and behind that is strong market growth,” Chief Executive Officer Mike Roman said. Total revenue fell 2.6% to $8.17 billion as the company continues to struggle with lower demand in the high-growth China automotive and electronics sectors. Sales in Asia-Pacific, 3M’s biggest market outside the United States, fell 3.5%. The company also booked a charge related to the restructuring of its Venezuela operations that pushed down profit by 39% to $1.13 billion, or $1.92 per share, in the second quarter ended June 30. Excluding items, it earned $2.20 per share. Analysts were expecting $2.05 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. 3M also reiterated its 2019 adjusted profit forecast to be between $9.25 to $9.75 per share. 3M’s beat and reaffirmation of 2019 outlook were likely viewed positively by the market, after many analysts had called out 3M as a top short heading into the quarter, due to weakness in some of its key markets, Gordon Haskett analyst John Inch said.

The maker of Post-it notes and Scotch tape is buying the company and some of its units from a consortium of funds advised by Apax Partners, affiliates of Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and the Public Sector Pension Investment Board. Acelity, under its KCI brand, makes advanced wound dressings and specialized systems that use a vacuum to seal off acute or chronic wounds, promoting faster healing. The company reported revenue of $1.5 billion in 2018, nearly 80 percent of which came from sales of such specialized systems that provide “negative pressure wound therapy”. 3M said the acquisition would boost its presence in the advanced wound care market, which is valued at more than $8 billion and is growing at a rate of 4 percent to 6 percent annually. The purchase price values Acelity at 15 times its 2018 adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, 3M said. Acelity will become part of 3M’s medical solutions business that makes medical tapes, sterilization products and acute wound care dressings products. The deal is expected to close in the second half of 2019. Excluding one-time expenses, 3M expects the deal to add 25 cents per share to its earnings in the first year following the closure of the deal. 3M also said it now expects full-year 2019 share buyback program to be in the range of $1.0 billion to $1.5 billion, compared with a prior range of $2.0 billion to $4.0 billion.

-6.276021003052061," 3M cuts 2019 profit outlook on weak China, shares fall 11 percent (Reuters) - Shares of 3M Co fell 11 percent on Thursday after the U.S. manufacturing conglomerate cut its 2019 earnings forecast and said it would lay off 2,000 workers, citing worsening performance in high-growth markets such as China. The stock’s worst day in more than three decades dragged down the Dow Jones Industrial Average, and added to the gloom across the manufacturing sector following bleak results from Caterpillar Inc and United Parcel Service Inc. 3M, which makes everything from adhesive tapes to air filters, said the dismal performance in the first three months of 2019 was caused by weak demand in the China automotive and electronics sectors, causing it to cut production. “We didn’t respond aggressively enough to what we were seeing. And so, we’re behind the curve,” Chief Executive Officer Mike Roman said on a post earnings call with analysts. Roman added that the maker of Post-it notes and Scotch tape was slow to align its spending with reduced output, and this dented margins. An analyst on the call peppered management with questions on Roman’s management style and asked if 3M needed to change its incentives or compensation schemes to get its leaders to adapt faster to the changing macro economy. “We’re going to take stock of what we’re doing, how we’re doing it, and compensation is an important piece and we look at that as well,” Roman said. 3M’s shares have underperformed peers such as Honeywell International Inc since Roman took the helm in July last year, with the stock rising 11.4 percent, compared with a 24 percent gain for Honeywell. “Since the prior CEO stepped down, 3M has really not performed anywhere close to its industrial peers,” Melius Research analyst Scott Davis told CNBC. The results come a day after heavy equipment maker Caterpillar Inc flagged tepid sales in its construction equipment business in the Asia-Pacific region, pointing to subdued growth in China. After a sharp slowdown in the fourth quarter, China’s economy unexpectedly grew at a steady 6.4 percent pace in the first quarter, but analysts cautioned that it was too early to call a sustainable turnaround. Sales in Asia-Pacific, 3M’s biggest market outside the United States, fell 7.4 percent, while Europe, Middle East and Africa reported declines of 9.4 percent. Sales in the United States rose just 0.1 percent. “The only positive that may come out today for the stock is that one of the sell-side bulls may downgrade, as even the most disingenuous analyst has to admit a change in thesis,” J.P.Morgan analyst Stephen Tusa wrote in a note. 3M now expects 2019 adjusted earnings between $9.25 and $9.75 per share, versus its prior forecast of $10.45 to $10.90. The job cuts would result in an estimated annual pre-tax savings range of $225 million to $250 million, with $100 million in the remainder of 2019, the company said in a statement here."

-2.7544673444709886," 3M warns of slowdown in China, trims sales forecast (Reuters) - 3M Co became the latest major U.S. manufacturer to warn that a slowdown at its Chinese business was hurting revenue, as it tempered its overall sales projections on Tuesday. 3M, which makes everything from adhesive tapes to air filters, said it saw sluggish sales in its global automotive and electronics business led by weak customer demand in China. Wall Street investors have been spooked by bleak forecasts from a range of companies including iPhone maker Apple Inc and heavy machinery producer Caterpillar Inc, which are fanning fears of a slowdown in the world’s second largest economy. 3M now expects organic sales growth of between 1 percent and 4 percent, compared with an earlier estimate of 2 to 4 percent. “It’s not a huge step down, but it’s a revision down in the first half of the year really driven by China,” 3M Chief Executive Officer Mike Roman said on a conference call with analysts. The maker of Scotch tape and Post-It notes said its Chinese business was slowing partly because of improving air quality which reduced demand for 3M-made air filters. The company also trimmed its 2019 earnings outlook to between $10.45 and $10.90 per share from $10.60 to $11.05 per share, mainly due to its pending acquisition of the technology business of healthcare services provider M*Modal. Overall, the Minnesota-headquartered manufacturer took a more positive view of global trade tensions, lowering its estimate of the hit to its full-year earnings from trade tariffs to $70 million. It had earlier expected a $100 million hit. “Some of the things that we were expecting on tariffs haven’t turned out quite as bad as what we were estimating,” 3M Chief Financial Officer Nicholas Gangestad said. 3M’s shares rose 3.1 percent to $198.97 on Tuesday after it reported better-than-expected sales and profit for the fourth quarter."
0.5469280365138561," US STOCKS-Wall St cuts losses as investors snap up shares (For a live blog on the U.S. stock market, click LIVE/ or type LIVE/ in an Eikon news window) * Caterpillar, 3M forecasts slam industrial stocks * Technical buying helps * Dow down 0.3 pct, S&P down 0.3 pct, Nasdaq down 0.2 pct (Updates prices to afternoon, changes comment) NEW YORK, Oct 23 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks cut their losses late on Tuesday and the Nasdaq briefly turned higher as investors bought back beaten-down shares, though worries about company earnings outlooks kept a lid on the market. Shares of Caterpillar tumbled after the heavy-duty equipment maker maintained its 2018 earnings forecast, following forecast increases in the previous two quarters. 3M Co slid after cutting its full-year profit outlook. That reignited worries over the impact of rising borrowing costs, wages and tariffs on corporate profits, and caused S&P industrial stocks to slide. The index was still down 1 percent. But indexes were well off their lows of the day in late trading, as investors snapped up shares. “There was a lot of early morning fear, and when the market didn’t accelerate further to the downside, you saw some people coming in to pick up some stocks,” said Rick Meckler, partner, Cherry Lane Investments, a family investment office in New Vernon, New Jersey. The day’s earnings disappointments aside, he said, technology earnings later this week could be upbeat. “The companies that disappointed tended to be in the industrial sector, and there are a wide range of companies reporting,” he said. Technical buying at support levels at 2,700 on the S&P 500 also helped stocks to bounce back, analysts said. At 3:31PM ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 78.75 points, or 0.31 percent, to 25,238.66, the S&P 500 lost 9.46 points, or 0.34 percent, to 2,746.42 and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 15.26 points, or 0.2 percent, to 7,453.37. Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.91-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.40-to-1 ratio favored decliners. The S&P 500 posted 3 new 52-week highs and 86 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 7 new highs and 373 new lows.

2.749855232307347," 3M to pay $9.1 million over defective military ear plugs WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The 3M Co. has agreed to pay $9.1 million to settle allegations it knowingly sold defective combat ear plugs to the U.S. military without disclosing defects that limited the effectiveness of the hearing protection devices, the U.S. Justice Department said on Thursday. Acting Assistant Attorney General Chad Readler said the settlement demonstrated that “government contractors who seek to profit at the expense of our military will face appropriate consequences.” A settlement frees 3M from the inconvenience of a long investigation and litigation, it said. “We take great pride in our products and this resolution is not an admission of liability, but simply a decision to move forward with our mission to provide high-quality personal safety equipment products to our customers,” the company said in a statement. The 3M payment settles allegations that 3M and its predecessor, Aearo Technologies Inc., knew the ear plugs it sold the military were too short for proper insertion into the users’ ears and could loosen and not perform effectively in some people, the Justice Department said."
10.915695314780676," New 3M CEO seeks to develop or buy way to higher growth DETROIT (Reuters) - The new chief executive of 3M Co MMM.N is looking at both buying companies and selling underperforming units while investing in developing the next blockbuster product in a bid to drive faster growth at the industrials group that makes products ranging from adhesive tape to air filters. “We’re looking at acquisitions in attractive parts of our portfolio… and how they can leverage our fundamental strengths,” Mike Roman told Reuters just before taking up his role on July 1. “In some cases that might also lead to divestitures.” 3M’s sales were $31.7 billion in 2017, and business is growing during an economic upturn. But investors are not satisfied with the rate of growth, and the company’s shares fell 7 percent in April after 3M cut its organic sales growth forecast for 2018 to a range of 3 percent to 4 percent from a range of 4 percent to 5 percent. Shares were up 1.5 percent on Tuesday morning at $198.34, still well below the year high of $259.77. “The knock against 3M is that they are so big it’s hard for them to maintain a higher growth rate,” said Morningstar analyst Joshua Aguilar. 3M needs a significant new product it can sell across different groups in its portfolio, he said. One promising 3M product is Novec, a non-flammable, non-conductive liquid fluorochemical that could be used to cool servers at data centers and which 3M also is testing for use in electric vehicles. 3M CEO Roman highlighted that the conglomerate has increased research and development spending to 6 percent of revenue from 5.5 percent. 3M has also beefed up its safety business - which sells products such as masks, protective clothing and harnesses - with the acquisition of Capital Safety for $2.5 billion in 2015 and Scott Safety for $2 billion last October. The company has already shed underperforming businesses. Most recently, 3M said in December it would sell most of its telecoms business to Corning Inc GLW.N for $900 million. William Blair analyst Nicholas Heymann said growth through acquisition makes sense for 3M, but cautioned valuations have risen a lot in the last couple of years, making it more difficult for newly purchased businesses to drive quick gains in profit. Steel and aluminum tariffs imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump have not hurt 3M directly, Roman said. But higher raw materials costs could cause 3M customers to move their factories. “We haven’t seen our customers shifting production yet,” he said. “But depending on where trade negotiations go, they could shift production. But we would follow them.”"
9.406754805436861," New York sues 3M, five others over toxic chemical contamination NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York state sued 3M Co and five other companies to recover the cost of cleaning up environmental contamination caused by toxic chemicals in firefighting foam that they manufactured. Governor Andrew Cuomo and Attorney General Barbara Underwood said on Wednesday the lawsuit seeks more than $38.8 million plus punitive damages and is the first of its type by a U.S. state. New York said the use of the foam at five military and civilian airports in the state caused “extensive contamination” to nearby fish, soil and water and increased the risk to people of immune system damage and other health problems. The companies knew or should have known by the 1970s that the foam, when used as intended, could threaten public health and the environment, the state said. “New York is working to end the dangerous practices that threaten our natural resources,” Cuomo said in a statement. The lawsuit was filed on Tuesday evening in New York’s Supreme Court in Albany, the state capital. In an email, 3M spokeswoman Donna Fleming Runyon said the St. Paul, Minnesota-based company “acted responsibly at all times and will defend its record of stewardship” in connection with its manufacture and sale of the foam. Other defendants include Buckeye Fire Equipment Co, Chemguard Inc, Kidde-Fenwal Inc, National Foam Inc and Tyco Fire Products LP. The five airports are Stewart International Airport in New Windsor, Stewart Air National Guard Base in Newburgh, Francis S. Gabreski Airport in Southampton, Plattsburgh Air Force Base in Plattsburgh and Griffiss Air Force Base in Rome. The Plattsburgh and Griffiss bases have closed. The case is New York v 3M Co et al, New York State Supreme Court, Albany County, No. 904029-18."
