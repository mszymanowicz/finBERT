Belini, speaking at the New York Stock Exchange before ringing the closing bell, said there was no set time line once the Minas Gerais state government sends the plan to the legislature for approval. But he added the state would require about half a year to convince legislators it should sell off its controlling stake in the company. “In my view, the time line necessary for that to occur would be at the maximum six months,” Belini said. Earlier this month, Belini said approval could come by the end of the year. Analysts have said a positive outcome for Minas Gerais Governor Romeu Zema’s effort to privatize Cemig is far from a sure thing given that it would need to be approved either by a three-fifths vote of the state legislature or a popular referendum. Zema is expected to send the project to the state legislature soon, said Cemig Chief Financial Officer Mauricio Fernandes, who did not specify a date. Fernandes also said Cemig was keeping its financing options open both in the local and foreign markets, while also looking to purchase older debt. “It is cheaper to transact (in Brazil) than abroad, but at the same time we keep both options because we also recognize the importance of the market here (in New York),” he said. He said some of the proceeds of the sale of Cemig's stake in Light LIGT3.SA were being used to purchase bonds in the secondary market. “We don’t have just one route to follow. We have the options of maybe repurchasing, at the same time launching a new bond and giving investors an option to exchange,” Fernandes said."

Earlier on Friday, Cemig CEO Cledorvino Belini said its privatization may be approved this year. According to data from Refinitiv Eikon, Cemig, which is controlled by Minas Gerais state, has a market value of about 22 billion reais ($5.5 billion). The strategy for CPFL, which is controlled by State Grid Corporation of China, is to look at a wide range of assets from generation and renewables to distribution and transmission lines, Estrella said, also noting the company’s drive to reduce debt. “The size of CPFL and the size of our shareholder should give an indication on the scale of the company’s ambitions. So we don’t rule out any potential assets,” Estrella said. State Grid, the world’s largest electric company, paid 14.2 billion reais for control of CPFL in early 2017."

At an auction in Cemig’s headquarters in the interior state of Minas Gerais, American Tower won Lot 1 of the network with a 571 million reais ($152 million) bid, and Algar won the smaller Lot 2 with a 78 million reais bid. While the Brazilian units of Telefonica SA TEF.MCVIVT4.SA, Telecom Italia SpA TLIT.MITIMP3.SA and America Movil SAB de CV AMXL.MX had mulled bids, they ended up not making any offers. Some potential buyers Reuters consulted in recent weeks considered the 367 million-real minimum price for the units to be relatively high. Still, American Tower's bid of 571 million reais was well above the minimum. Brazil-listed shares in Cemig were trading up 0.7 percent in early afternoon trade, while the benchmark Bovespa .BVSP was roughly flat. For Algar, the profile of Lot 2 fits with the company’s plans to expand its network into Brazil’s northeastern states. The company had planned an initial public offering late last year, but scuttled it after GIC, a sovereign wealth fund established by the government of Singapore, took a stake in the firm and injected about 360 million reais of capital.

Cemig, as the company is widely known, plans to auction the assets of its telecoms unit, Cemig Telecom, for a minimum of 367 million reais ($96.9 million) as part of a plan to reduce its large debt load. But the interest level in the unit, and its fiber optic network stretching 5,900 miles (9,500 km) across some of Brazil’s wealthiest and most industrial states, could push up that figure. The 16 interested parties have signed confidentiality agreements in order to participate in this stage of the process, the person said. “The interest was surprising, a lot more favorable than imagined. They are big companies,” the source said. Cemig did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Interested companies include telecoms like Claro SA, a unit of Mexico’s America Movil SAB de CV, as well as infrastructure operators such as American Tower Corp and Phoenix Tower, according to the source. Reuters previously reported that Telefonica Brasil SA , TIM Participacoes SA, Vogel Solucoes em Telecomunicacoes e Informatica SA, Algar Telecom SA and Aloo Telecom were interested in the assets. Representatives for Claro, Telefonica Brasil, TIM, Vogel, Algar, and Blackstone Group LP, which owns Phoenix Tower, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Friday. American Tower Corp declined to comment. Representatives for Aloo could not immediately be contacted. Vogel had confirmed to Reuters in March it was interested in Cemig Telecom, while Telefonica Brasil’s chief operating officer, Christian Gebara, told Reuters in April the company was looking closely at the unit.

The sale will be divided into two lots, the first to include Cemig’s fiber network in Minas Gerais, Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro states, with the second to be held for its network in Goias, Bahia, Pernambuco and Ceara states."
