14.426505960998453," Burger King to sell new hand-breaded chicken sandwich in U.S NEW YORK (Reuters) - Burger King will launch a new crispy chicken sandwich this year in the United States after successful tests, it said on Wednesday, the only major fast-food burger chain that plans to bread its fillets by hand in restaurants. The company, a unit of Restaurant Brands International Inc, is competing against rival hamburger brands, including McDonald’s Corp for consumers’ increasing cravings for chicken. Burger King will also be competing against Popeyes, another Restaurant Brands International unit that helped launch the popularity of chicken sandwiches when it rolled out its first sandwich in 2019. Burger King started test-runs at a few locations in September. The sandwich will come in original or spicy and will be served on a potato bun with deli pickles and a savory sauce. The company would not confirm exactly when the sandwich will launch. The item will be rolled out to 1,000 Burger King locations at a time, according to Ellie Doty, chief marketing officer, Burger King North America. Comparable sandwiches to be sold by McDonald’s and some other chains are usually pre-breaded and frozen before arriving at restaurants. Burger King’s approach, however, will be similar to Popeyes and other chicken specialists. It could be a big challenge for operations. Burger King must add new breading stations inside of stores, with about 6 different bins for dredging and battering the white-meat fillets. The sandwiches will take about five minutes to prepare versus two to three minutes to grill a Whopper, for example, Doty said. The sandwich is currently being tested in six areas and selling for different prices. In Huntsville, Alabama, it is $3.89, and in Providence, Rhode Island, it costs $3.99 - about the same price as sandwiches from competing chicken chains, including Chick-fil-A. Burger King has not determined a final price yet, Doty said."

5.700187697240981," Burger King revamps brand for first time in over 20 years (Reuters) - Burger King has redesigned its brand including its logo, food packaging and restaurants in order to reflect improvements such as eliminating preservatives, the fast food chain announced on Thursday. “We’ve been doing a lot in terms of food quality and experience,” said Fernando Machado, global chief marketing officer of Restaurant Brands International, which owns Burger King. “We felt that putting a wrap around all that with an upgrade of our visual identity would help signal to our consumers that this is a brand that’s evolving.” The rebranding, Burger King’s first in over 20 years, includes a new logo with a rounded font that mirrors the shape of its burgers and other menu items. Bold colors in shades of brown, red and green are a nod to Burger King’s flame grilling process and its use of fresh ingredients, the company said. Burger King earlier this year announced it would remove all artificial colors and preservatives from its signature Whopper burgers as fast food chains are increasingly introducing healthier options to follow consumer tastes. The company’s famously quirky plastic-faced mascot - The King - won’t be going anywhere despite the rebranding. “We love him the way he is, and he will continue to be weird,” Machado said."

8.950889520376057," Restaurant Brands expects Burger King third-quarter sales to drop, Popeyes to shine (Reuters) - Restaurant Brands International Inc QSR.TOQSR.N on Wednesday forecast Burger King's quarterly comparable sales to decline due to the COVID-19 pandemic, even though demand for its chicken sandwiches was likely to boost growth for Popeyes. The company reported preliminary comparable sales drop of 7% for the three months ended Sept. 30 at its flagship Burger King operation globally. However, that was an improvement from a 13.4% fall it reported in the previous quarter when most of its restaurants were closed for dine-in due to lockdowns. Bigger rival McDonald's Corp MCD.N earlier this month said global sales improved in the third quarter, down just 2.2%, as drive-through orders surged and special promotions lifted sales to double-digit percentage increases in September. McDonald’s had great success with a limited-time promotional deal with rapper Travis Scott, which led to ingredient shortages. Burger King last month unveiled a new restaurant design with touchless features, mobile order and curbside pick-up services as consumers avoid crowded areas and rely on delivery to curb the spread of the virus. At Tim Hortons, its breakfast chain that has struggled this year as offices and colleges shift online, comparable sales are expected to fall 12.5%. Popeyes is expected to lift sales for another quarter, with sales expected to rise 17.4%. Revenue is likely to range between $1.32 billion and $1.34 billion, compared with Wall Street estimates of $1.34 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv."
-1.5917338020381113," Restaurant Brands to close hundreds more outlets to weather pandemic (Reuters) - Restaurant Brands International Inc QSR.TO said on Thursday it will close hundreds more outlets this year as the owner of Burger King and Tim Hortons looks to shore up capital to weather a sales hit from the COVID-19 pandemic. Sales at Burger King and Tim Hortons have been hammered in recent months due to coronavirus-led restrictions on indoor dining and a drop in demand for on-the-go breakfast and coffee, with the company reporting an over 25% fall in overall second-quarter revenue. Canada-focused Tim Hortons has been especially hard hit due to the country’s slower pace of reopening, said Chief Executive Officer Jose Cil. “Canada has generally followed a measured pace of reopening, which has helped effectively contain the virus, but has led to a slower pickup in activity and re-establishment of routines,” Cil told analysts. Restaurant Brands expects to end 2020 with roughly the same number of outlets as last year - a little over 27,000 - as the company continues to open new restaurants as part of its annual plan. It had net restaurant growth of over 5% in each of the last three years. Restaurant Brands’ shares fell 2% in morning trading. Still, growth at Popeyes has been surging, with the company cashing-in on its massively popular fried chicken sandwiches to expand into markets such as China. Comparable sales at Cajun-inspired chain rose nearly 25% in the second quarter and come at a time when McDonald's Corp MCD.N, Starbucks Corp SBUX.O and Dunkin Brands DNKN.O have all seen a drop. On an adjusted basis, the company earned 33 cents per share in the second quarter ended June 30, beating Wall Street expectations of 31 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv."

Restaurant Brands shares, which have risen 42% this year, were up as much as 4.2% at a record high of C$100.35. Fast-food chains in North America are exploring ways to add faux meat offerings to their menu, as more customers switch to vegan diets. Burger King was one of the first publicly listed burger chains to join the vegan bandwagon. The burger maker, known for its Whopper burgers, and plant-based burger maker Impossible Foods in April started selling their vegan burger Impossible Whopper in 59 stores in and around St. Louis, Missouri, with nationwide sales expected by this month. “The August launch of the Impossible Burger will give bulls reason to stay constructive,” Bernstein analysts said in a note on Friday. Restaurant Brands, which also owns coffee-and-donut chain Tim Hortons and fast-food restaurant chain Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen, said Burger King was seeing strength outside of the United States, particularly in China, India, Brazil and Spain. Tim Hortons also serves breakfast sandwiches made with faux-meat burger maker Beyond Meat Inc's BYND.O Beyond Sausage in Canada. Tim Hortons is set to enter Thailand, its third market in Asia, while Restaurant Brands is also expanding its fast-food restaurant chain Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen into Spain.

14.157659028616349," Restaurant Brands profit misses as Burger King fails to deliver (Reuters) - Restaurant Brands International Inc's QSR.TO quarterly profit fell short of analysts' estimates on Wednesday as its Burger King unit struggled in a fiercely competitive U.S. market and sales growth at Tim Hortons cafes remained sluggish. The first steps in a C$700 million revamp of Hortons - a Canadian icon that now has more than 800 U.S. outlets - saw same-store sales grow 0.6 percent in the third quarter, double that a year earlier and up from a flat performance in the preceding quarter. But that remained slow and analysts said both Burger King and Hortons faced entrenched issues in a North American fast-food market that is bristling with competition from McDonald's Corp MCD.N and Yum Brands Inc's YUM.N Kentucky Fried Chicken. Burger King’s U.S. same-store sales declined 0.7 percent, compared with an increase of 4 percent a year ago, while McDonald’s reported a 2.4 percent growth on Tuesday. Neil Saunders, an analyst with GlobalData Retail, said while Burger King’s advertising campaigns paid off, the results had not proved durable and growth was “sluggish”. “The comparable figures from Burger King are particularly disappointing given the number of strong promotions and campaigns that the chain has run,” he said. “Burger King clearly needs to get better at driving more regular traffic.” He said moves to renovate cafes, introduce online ordering and offer anytime breakfast bode well for Hortons, but noted the chain would soon be facing the effects of Dunkin' Brands DNKN.O recently announced revamp. McDonald’s has profited from a years-long program of renovations at its international restaurants and Restaurant Brands Chief Executive Officer Daniel Schwartz unveiled plans for a similar U.S. program at Burger King. A new “Garden Grill” design aims to make restaurants feel more upmarket, bedecked with warm wooden tables and decor, plants and modern ordering kiosks that will follow in the footsteps of the touch screens introduced by McDonald’s. “This is a step in the right direction as it comes at a time when other chains are also improving their images and turning restaurants into places where people can linger and enjoy their time,” Saunders said. On an adjusted basis, Restaurant Brands earned 63 cents per share, compared with analysts’ average estimate of 65 cents, according to Refinitiv data.

Restaurant Brands said comparable sales at Burger King rose 1.8 percent in the second quarter, compared with a 3.9 percent increase a year earlier. Like other fast-food chains, the Whopper burger maker has struggled to attract customers in a slowing U.S. market, which is also its biggest.

In contrast, same-store sales at Restaurant Brands’ coffee chain, Tim Hortons, stabilized in the latest quarter as it overhauled stores and introduced new menu items, including “Breakfast Anytime”. Same-store sales at Tim Hortons were flat, compared with a 0.8 percent dip a year earlier. “We were also encouraged to see stable results at Tim Hortons and the launch of all-day breakfast, which we believe will drive incremental traffic gains,” Stephens Inc analyst Will Slabaugh said. Tim Hortons is looking to tap a growing cafe culture in China and said in July that it would open 1,500 coffee-and-donut outlets in the country. The move is part of a strategy by Tim Hortons’ new president, Alex Macedo, who is trying to cope with mounting competition in the industry.

17.58725885983648," Canadian coffee chain Tim Hortons' U.S. franchisees to sue parent TORONTO (Reuters) - A group of Canadian coffee chain Tim Horton's U.S. franchisees said on Thursday it is suing parent company Restaurant Brands International QSR.TO, escalating growing tensions between the company and owners of its U.S. and Canadian coffee shops. The Great White North Franchisee Association-U.S. is challenging a clause in Restaurant Brands’ franchise agreements that requires all disputes to be resolved in Federal Court in Miami, according to an emailed statement from the group. Once this is resolved, the U.S association said it plans to file another lawsuit claiming improper use of an advertising fund franchisees pay into. It said the company had used the fund to pay overhead expenses unrelated to promoting the brand. “We can’t comment on the specifics of any ongoing legal matters, however, these allegations are completely false,” Restaurant Brands said by email. “We’re proud of the way we conduct our business, and nothing will distract us from our primary focus, which is serving the needs of our restaurant owners and guests.” The moves by the U.S. franchisees are the latest in a long-running feud between Tim Hortons’ parent company and its franchisees, which has now drawn the attention of the Canadian government. Tim Hortons fell to 50th from fourth on an annual ranking of brand reputation in Canada based on surveys between Dec. 19 and Jan. 29 by market research firm Leger. Tim Hortons has 729 locations in the U.S. and 4,258 in Canada, according to its website. Restaurant Brands also owns the Burger King and Popeyes Louisiana Chicken chains. After Tim Hortons’ same-store sales fell for the eighth consecutive quarter in the latest earnings period, Restaurant Brands Chief Executive Daniel Schwartz said last month that “negative media created by this group of franchisees” is hurting customer perceptions of the brand. Restaurant Brands shares have fallen 10 percent this year, compared with a 3.8 percent decline in the Toronto stock benchmark. The U.S. action follows a C$500 million ($389 million) lawsuit filed by their Canadian counterparts in June, also alleging mismanagement of a national advertising fund. The Canadian franchisee association filed a second, C$850 million, lawsuit in October saying the company was trying to intimidate restaurant owners. Both lawsuits are still trying to obtain certification as class actions, a spokesperson for the association said by email on Thursday. The franchisee association, whose membership includes 60 percent of Tim Hortons owners in Canada, and half of those in the U.S., was formed in March 2017 in Canada “in response to the mismanagement of the Tim Hortons franchise,” according to the group. The U.S. arm was formed in June. ($1 = 1.2858 Canadian dollars)"

15.495855640051781," Restaurant Brands plans C$700 million Tim Hortons makeover (Reuters) - Burger King owner Restaurant Brands International Inc QSR.TO and its franchisees will spend C$700 million ($546 million) over four years to revamp coffee chain Tim Hortons, following a round of bad publicity over its management of the Canadian chain. The revamp, unveiled by managers on a conference call with analysts on Tuesday, followed first-quarter results which suggested initiatives including cheaper meals and new breakfast options were bearing fruit at Burger King outlets. Toronto-listed shares in the company rose 5 percent to C$72.36 in morning trading, while the U.S. equivalent gained 4.8 percent to $56.08. Politicians have criticized Hortons for its reaction to minimum wage increases in Ontario, while a group of franchisees has alleged Restaurant Brands is not keeping to the terms of a 2014 deal to buy the chain. Hortons’ same-store sales fell for the eighth consecutive quarter in the first three months of the year, the company’s results showed. “The environment’s competitive and the fact that there’s a ton of negative media created by this group of franchisees is also hurting guest perception,” Chief Executive Daniel Schwartz said on the post-earnings call. Restaurant Brands said it would redesign Tim Hortons restaurants, focus on technology and introduce more lunch options at the chain. The company, which expects to remodel most of Hortons outlets in Canada by 2021, did not disclose how it planned to split the cost with franchisees as they face rising competition from Starbucks and McDonald’s McCafe among others. By contrast, a 3.8 percent rise in Burger King comparable sales topped a consensus forecast of 3.5 percent and helped Restaurant Brands beat first-quarter profit estimate. Excluding items, Restaurant Brands posted earnings of 66 cents per share, beating analysts’ average estimate of 56 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income attributable to shareholders tripled to $151 million, or 60 cents per share, in the three months ended March 31. The company reported under a new accounting standards for this quarter.
