29.3931922668355," Homebuilder Horton lifts 2021 sales view as low rates, pandemic drive demand (Reuters) - D.R. Horton Inc raised its 2021 home sales forecast on Tuesday, as historically low mortgage rates and a pandemic-driven shift towards suburban living continue to whet homebuyer appetite. The company’s shares rose 4.3% to $82.43 after the U.S. homebuilder posted quarterly profit and revenue above Wall Street estimates. The U.S. housing market is facing an exodus from city centers to suburbs and other low-density areas as companies allow employees to work from home and schools shift to online classes because of the COVID-19 outbreak. “We are well-positioned for the spring selling season and the remainder of 2021,” Chief Executive David Auld said on a post-earnings call with analysts. “The demand out there is really driven by demographics, and I think it has been accelerated because of the pandemic and people’s desire to find a safe environment for their family.” D.R. Horton said demand remained strong amid a limited supply of homes at affordable prices, adding that the company still had pricing power and was using very few sales incentives. Horton now expects home sales in its fiscal 2021 to be between 80,000 and 82,000 homes, above a prior forecast of between 77,000 and 80,000 homes. Orders, an indicator of future sales, jumped 55.6% to 20,418 homes in the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2020, while the number of homes sold rose 44.6% to 18, 739. Total revenue rose to $5.93 billion, from $4.02 billion on-year. Net income attributable to the company rose 83.6% to $791.8 million, or $2.14 per share from a year-ago period. Analysts on average expected a profit of $1.69 per share on a revenue of $5.54 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv."

16.815836741139627," D.R. Horton beats quarterly profit, sees 2021 sales above estimates (Reuters) - D.R. Horton Inc DHI.N on Tuesday reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit and forecast 2021 home sales above estimates on record low mortgage rates, while warning of risks to the market from coronavirus infections and restrictions. The company’s shares, which have jumped 23% this year, rose 2.8% in premarket trade, as D.R. Horton reported a jump in both fourth-quarter profit and sales from a year earlier, fueled by the housing market outperforming much of the U.S. economy. The National Association of Realtors last month said U.S. existing home sales surged in September to levels not seen in more than 14 years, with wealthier buyers seeking to move out of cities as the COVID-19 pandemic fuels demand for upscale housing. D.R. Horton said it expects home sales in fiscal year 2021 to be between 77,000 and 80,000 units, compared with analysts’ average estimate of 75,981, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. It also declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.20 per share, a 14% jump compared to its last payout, as net income attributable to the company rose to $829 million, or $2.24 per share, in the quarter from $505.3 million, or $1.35 per share, a year earlier. Home sales rose 26% to 20,248 units. Analysts on average had expected a profit of $1.76 per share. The company, however, also warned of the impact of the pandemic on underlying demand. Analysts say rises in home values have priced some buyers out of the market and warn that there are also an estimated 3 million households covered by COVID-19 mortgage forbearance at risk of losing their homes next spring. “There is significant uncertainty regarding the extent to which and how long COVID-19 and its related effects will impact the U.S. economy,” Horton warned in its statement."

6.926881308006511," U.S. housing bounce drives D.R. Horton profit beat, bullish outlook (Reuters) - D.R. Horton DHI.N on Tuesday reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit and forecast current quarter revenue above estimates, as record-low mortgage rates and a shift towards suburban living caused by the coronavirus crisis boosted sales. Shares of the no.1 U.S. homebuilder rose as much as 5.6% to a record $70.29, buoyed by the results and the U.S. housing sector’s swift recovery from the initial round of lockdowns that idled much of the economy earlier this year. New home sales raced near a 13-year high last month, underpinned by borrowing costs at their lowest in almost half a century, with 30-year fixed mortgage rates averaging just above 3%. Work from home and home schooling have fueled demand for spacious homes in less densely populated areas, boosting home sales further for U.S. builders. D.R. Horton said it was seeing strong demand from the millennial, who have delayed forming households in comparison with the prior generations. “It is a very, very, good market right now,” Chief Executive Officer David Auld said. “There’s just a whole lot of people out there that I think are going to be looking for housing over the next five-plus years.”Analysts see the company particularly well placed among U.S homebuilders due to it high share of affordable entry-level homes popular among first-time buyers. The company, which withdrew it full-year outlook in April, said it expected to deliver between 18,000 and 19,000 homes in the fourth quarter, above analysts’ expectation of 15,469 deliveries, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. D.R. Horton said orders, an indicator of future sales, jumped 38% to 21,519 homes in the third quarter ended June 30, beating Wall Street’s estimate of 14,853 units. Its home sales rose 10.5% to 17,642 homes in the quarter, topping analysts’ expectation of 17,068 units. Total revenue rose 10% to $5.39 billion, also beating estimates of $5.13 billion."
55.33829711296947," D.R. Horton pulls forecast as coronavirus crisis dents home demand (Reuters) - Top U.S. homebuilder D.R. Horton Inc DHI.N abandoned its full-year financial targets on Tuesday, citing a jump in order cancellations as coronavirus-induced shutdowns left thousands of Americans out of work and worried about their financial future. The U.S. housing market was on a steady footing just before the outbreak on lower mortgage rates and a healthy job market, and the health crisis now threatens to derail the sector. The company said it experienced increases in sales cancellations and decreases in orders in late March and early April, compared to the weeks leading up to the outbreak. There is uncertainty over the extent and timing of disruption COVID-19 - the respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus - will have on U.S. consumer confidence, demand for homes and availability of mortgage loans, the company said. Rival Lennar Corp LEN.N last month suspended its forecast, blaming lockdowns aimed at curbing the spread of the disease. D.R.Horton, which reported preliminary results for the second quarter ended March 31, said gross sales orders rose 14% to 8,511 homes, but cancellations surged about 48% to 2,020 homes from a year earlier. Still, net sales orders for the quarter increased 20% to 20,087 homes, beating analysts’ average estimate of 18,433 homes, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. “As the country recovers from COVID, we anticipate the prior housing trends slowly return to normal in late spring/early summer due to the low level of existing homes for sale before COVID and the positive affordability trends,” Wedbush analyst Jay McCanless wrote in a note. McCanless raised his price target to $50 from $44 and reaffirmed his “outperform” rating. Home sales rose 8% to 14,539 and beat the 14,022 homes analysts had expected. The company's shares rose as much as 8.6% to $40.09 in early trading, as the broader S&P 500 index .SPX surged amid signs of flattening coronavirus outbreak.

Shares of the company gained 2.3% in premarket trade as orders, an indicator of future revenue, rose 18.9% to 13,126 homes in the first quarter. “We continue to see good demand and a limited supply of homes at affordable prices across our markets, and economic fundamentals and financing availability remain solid,” Chairman Donald Horton said. Horton added that the company was well-positioned for the spring selling season as well as the remainder of 2020. U.S. home sales jumped to their highest level in nearly two years in December, the latest indication that lower mortgage rates have been helping the housing market regain its footing, after it hit a soft patch in 2018. The company said it sold 12,959 homes in the quarter, up from 11,500, a year ago. D.R.

14.199830387858578," D.R. Horton sees 2020 home sales above estimates, shares rise (Reuters) - D.R. Horton Inc DHI.N topped expectations for quarterly profit and forecast 2020 home sales above analysts' estimates, as cheaper mortgage rates buoyed demand from buyers, sending shares in the biggest U.S. homebuilder up as much as 6%. The company said it pulled back on incentives in the fourth quarter, but they remained elevated for higher-priced homes. Horton spent more on incentives in late 2018 and early this year as affordability concerns had hit demand. In the quarter, the company’s average price for orders was $302,300, up only 1% from last year but in line with the broader trend of easing home prices as builders targeted first-time buyers and focused on more lower-priced homes. The median new house price fell 8.8% to $299,400 in September from a year ago, data from the Commerce Department showed. “Homes, they’re affordable as they’re going to get .. But right now, the market feels really, really good,” Chief Executive David Auld said on a post-earnings-call. However, the company said it does not expect margins to expand in 2020, citing increasing competition. Horton forecast full-year gross margins at about 21% - same as what it reported for the fourth quarter. “We feel good about maintaining our gross margin around the range it is right now, but it’s really going to be dependent on the spring,” a company executive said on the call. Home sales rose 9.2% to 16,024 units in the quarter, underpinning a 10-cent beat on profit. Orders rose 14.1% to 13,130 homes. Horton, which builds roughly 10% of all new U.S. homes, said it expects 2020 sales to be between 60,000 and 61,000 homes, compared with estimates of 59,737 homes, a reflection of the broader stabilization of demand for U.S. property. JMP Securities analyst Peter Martin said that lower interest rates and the company’s strategy of building more affordable homes had helped ease some of the tensions that hurt results a year ago. “If they (Horton) can keep supplying homes at a lower price point, and stay in the current range of interest rates, I think they are going to have a very nice year.” The company’s shares were last up 1% at $53.06."

Horton Inc topped expectations for profit and revenue in the fourth quarter and forecast 2020 home sales above analysts’ estimates, as cheaper mortgage rates buoyed demand from buyers, sending shares in the biggest U.S. homebuilder up 3%. Home sales rose 9.2% to 16,024 units in the quarter, underpinning a 10-cent beat on profit as it predicted it would sell more than 60,000 homes next year. JMP Securities analyst Peter Martin said that lower official interest rates and the company’s strategy of building more affordable homes had eased some of the tensions hurting its results a year ago. “Last year this time we had the highest pessimism because of rising interest rates, people were pulling back on affordability and builders were out of homes at the lower-end price points,” he said. “If they (Horton) can keep supplying homes at a lower price point, and stay in the current range of interest rates, I think they are going to have a very nice year.” The Federal Reserve has lowered borrowing costs thrice this year to offset headwinds caused by more than a year long trade war between the United States and China, and slowing global growth. Horton, which builds roughly 10% of all new U.S. homes, said it expects sales in 2020 to be between 60,000 and 61,000 homes, compared with analysts’ estimates of 59,737 homes. Orders, an indicator of future demand, rose 14.1% to 13,130 homes in the quarter. U.S. homebuilding tumbled from a more than a 12-year high in September, but single-family home construction rose for a fourth straight month, suggesting the housing market remains supported by lower mortgage rates even as the economy is slowing. Horton also forecast 2020 revenue between $18.5 billion and $19.0 billion, compared with estimates of $18.58 billion.

Horton Inc DHI.N on Tuesday said it expects lower incentive spending and strong buyer demand to benefit margins, sending its shares up about 6%. Horton spent more on incentives in late 2018 and early this year as affordability concerns had hit demand for their homes, but said it was now seeing buyers return to the market. “Interest rates on mortgage loans have since decreased so we reduced the level of incentives offered as the spring progressed,” Chief Executive Officer David Auld said on a post-earnings call with analysts. Cheaper mortgage rates and the lowest unemployment rate in nearly 50 years are supporting demand for housing. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate has dropped to an average of 3.81% from a more than seven-year peak of 4.94% in November, according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac. Gross margins for the third quarter ended June 30 was 20.3%, above the homebuilder’s forecast of between 19.3% and 19.8%. Horton said it expected gross margins for the fourth quarter to tick up, and forecast a range of 20.4% to 20.7%. Analysts on average expected 20.7%. Horton's results lifted homebuilders PulteGroup PHM.N, Lennar Corp LEN.N, KB Home KBH.N and Toll Brothers TOL.N between 1.8% and 2.5%, and pushed the S&P 1500 Homebuilding index .SPCOMHOME up 2.1%.

0.45794411516916705," Homebuilder Horton avoids 2019 margin forecast, raises cost worries (Reuters) - D.R. Horton Inc forecast 2019 revenue below Wall Street estimates and did not provide an outlook on gross margin for the year, spooking investors who have been worried about the impact of rising costs on future profits. Shares of the No.1 U.S. homebuilder fell about 5 percent in morning trade, dragging those of rivals such as Lennar Corp and PulteGroup Inc lower. Housing market fundamentals have been strengthening due to lower mortgage rates, but Horton’s effort to make its homes more affordable is coming at a cost amid widespread land and labor shortage in the industry. Some analysts have said the company has been spending more on incentives to spur sales. “Incentives is just one lever that is causing them some lack of clarity right now,” JMP Securities analyst Peter Martin said. Horton’s costs rose 10 percent to $3.26 billion in the second quarter, while its average closing price for the second quarter slipped 1 percent to $295,300. Home sales data for March showed builders were unable to break more ground on lower-priced housing projects - an area where Horton has been focusing on. “In terms of the gross margin, we’re balancing pace and price margin and volume to generate the best returns we have,” Chief Financial Officer Bill Wheat said in a conference call with analysts. “The incentive levels that we had to put in place to regain momentum back in Q1, we feel good about the level that we’re at and the ability to potentially start to carve some margin back.” In the reported quarter, Horton said gross margins fell sequentially to 19.3 percent, mainly due to cost increases, less pricing power and higher incentives. “Without the gross margin guidance (full year) people get a little nervous they could be at the lower end of gross margins,” JMP Securities’ Martin said. The company, whose homes sell in the price range of between $100,000 and $1 million, said 69 percent of its homes sold in the second quarter were under $300,000. “Affordability concerns have caused some moderation in demand for homes since late 2018 particularly at higher price points,” Chief Executive Officer David Auld said. Horton said it expects to deliver between 55,000 homes and 56,000 homes in 2019. Analysts on average were expecting home sales of 55,668 homes. The company topped expectations for quarterly orders at 16,805 homes at an average selling price of $294,100, down 2 percent from a year earlier. But its full-year revenue forecast of $16.7 billion to $17.0 billion fell short of the average analyst estimate of $17.16 billion. Net income attributable to Horton was largely flat at $351.3 million, or 93 cents per share, in the quarter ended March 31.

19.635624320011626," Homebuilder Horton hopes for better spring as higher prices bite (Reuters) - D.R. Horton Inc held out hope on Friday of improved demand for its homes in the spring selling season after a tough few months where higher prices and mortgage rates kept some buyers out of the market. Shares of the largest homebuilder in the United States by volume bounced around in morning trade after a results release which underlined the impact of higher prices on demand for more expensive housing. Speaking to analysts after the company’s first-quarter results, Chief Executive Officer David Auld remained upbeat about a U.S. housing market which saw sales tumble to their lowest in three years in December and house price increases slow. “The market is performing, I would say, pretty much as we expected, maybe a little better,” he said. “It’s going to be a little easier to get people on contract through this spring if it continues.” Chief Operating Officer Michael Murray added that he expected the spring selling season to be stronger compared to the last several years. House prices, which have taken years to recover from the 2008 sub-prime crisis, were driven higher last year by a generally robust U.S. economy and higher costs of labor, land and raw materials. Add to that generally higher Federal Reserve interest rates and Horton and other housebuilders said last year they were having to offer more incentives to potential buyers of more expensive homes. A dip in expectations for further moves by the Fed at the end of 2018, however, has pulled 30-year mortgage rates down from multi-year highs, of above 5 percent, and homebuilders are hopeful that moderation will help restore growth. Analysts also say that Horton’s focus on lower-priced houses for first-time buyers gives it an advantage over others. “We will see how it turns out for other builders, but so far I think D.R. Horton might be one of the only homebuilders that shows year-over-year increase in new orders,” Morningstar analyst Brian Bernard said. Earlier this month, Lennar Corp said it was seeing improvement in buyer traffic in the first quarter as interest rates begin to ease. D.R. Horton said 2019 revenue and profit margins will be determined by the strength of the upcoming spring season, and did not provide a forecast for the full year. The impact of the partial government shutdown has been relatively minimal on business, the company said, in line with comments this week from the National Association of Realtors, which said the shutdown had so far not had an impact on home sales, but warned that this could change. Horton’s orders, an indicator of future revenue, rose only 2.7 percent to 11,042 homes in the quarter ended Dec. 31, the slowest in more than five years. Net income attributable to the company rose 51.7 percent to $287.2 million, or 76 cents per share, in the reported quarter, missing analysts’ estimates of 78 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

11.125254597883218," D.R. Horton forecasts weak home sales, shares fall 10 percent (Reuters) - D.R. Horton DHI.N shares fell more than 10 percent after the largest U.S. homebuilder forecast first-quarter home sales below analysts' estimates on Thursday, the latest sign that rising mortgage rates and higher home prices are weighing on the housing market. The weakness in shares also hit other homebuilders' stocks. PulteGroup PHM.N fell 6 percent, while Lennar LEN.N was down 4 percent. The housing market has been a weak spot in a robust U.S. economy, with economists blaming the sluggishness on rising mortgage rates, which have combined with higher house prices, to make home purchasing unaffordable for some buyers. “The buyer is probably affordably stretched and taking a little bit of time to reset to changing market environment,” D.R. Horton Chief Operating Officer Michael Murray said on a conference call with analysts. The company said it was seeing a rise in incentive spending for homes priced $300,000 and above. These kinds of homes make up about a third of the company’s total deliveries. The homebuilder said it expects incentives to increase in the face of the choppy demand environment and forecast full-year 2019 home sales gross margins to be in the range of 20 percent to 22 percent, with the midpoint below analysts’ estimate of 21.48 percent. Demand is holding up in the less expensive category, but homebuilders have not been able to boost supplies as they have been held back by scarce labor, limited lot supplies and rising raw material costs. Single-family homebuilding, which accounts for the largest share of the housing market, has lost momentum since hitting a pace of 948,000 units last November, which was the strongest in more than 10 years. D.R. Horton said on Thursday it expects first-quarter home deliveries in the range of 11,000-11,500 units, below analysts’ average estimate of 11,852 homes, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The company, however, did not provide any details of its sales and profit expectations for 2019. For the fourth quarter, the company’s revenue rose 8.3 percent to $4.51 billion, but fell just short of estimate of $4.57 billion. The company’s net income rose 48.8 percent to $466.1 million, or $1.22 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Sept. 30, in line with analysts’ expectation.

0.9051589226938714," D.R. Horton sees 2018 homes sales below estimates (Reuters) - U.S. homebuilder D.R. Horton Inc DHI.N on Tuesday forecast fiscal 2018 home sales and orders below Wall Street estimates, as rising home prices and mortgage rates hurt ordinary Americans' ability to borrow. While U.S. homebuilders have enjoyed robust demand, a short supply of homes and higher labor and raw material costs are forcing builders to raise prices of homes, making them less affordable at the same time as rises in Federal Reserve interest rates increase the cost of borrowing. Mortgage rates are edging closer to the 5 percent threshold for the first time in years and the combination of these factors has raised concerns about a slowdown in the industry in 2019 as overall job growth is also expected to moderate. Earlier this month, rival Lennar Corp LEN.N cut its fourth-quarter forecast for orders and deliveries, partly due to the sluggishness in the market. Still, Horton, which should report fourth-quarter results next month, said it would sell 51,857 homes in fiscal 2018, an increase of 13 percent from a year earlier. That compared to an estimate of 52,325 homes, according to a Refinitiv consensus of analysts’ estimates. Orders, a key indicator of future revenue for homebuilders, are expected to rise 13 percent to 52,740 homes, the company said. Analysts had expected orders of 52,878 homes. D.R. Horton’s shares fell about 1 percent to $40.25 in premarket trading."

-17.53369748811702," Demand for affordable homes fuel D.R. Horton profit beat, Pulte orders dip (Reuters) - D.R. Horton DHI.N, the biggest U.S. homebuilder, on Thursday forecast revenue growth for 2019 after topping Wall Street quarterly profit estimates, underscoring strong housing demand. Over the past few years, homebuilders have enjoyed vigorous demand for affordable houses, bolstered by low interest rates, economic growth and an improving job market. But, higher building material costs, and shortages of land and labor are pushing homebuilders to raise home prices, diminishing affordability as more millennials and first-time buyers enter the housing market. An acute shortage of affordable homes in the United States will continue over the coming year, according to a recent Reuters poll, driving prices up faster than inflation and wage growth. D.R. Horton, based in Fort Worth, Texas, beat profit estimates for the seventh straight quarter. It raised the low end of its full-year revenue forecast to $16.1 billion from $15.9 billion, keeping the high end at $16.3 billion. The company expects revenue to grow 10 percent to 15 percent in fiscal 2019. “The company’s strategic shift towards more entry-level homes has paid off, with strong demand in this segment and limited supply,” Edward Jones analyst Robin Diedrich said. “The positive results should help alleviate some of investors’ concerns around slower new home sales due to high prices and rising interest rates,” Diedrich said. D.R. Horton posted a 12.3 percent rise in orders, an indicator of future revenue for homebuilders, in its fiscal third quarter ended June 30. D.R. Horton’s Express and Freedom brands, which sell homes at lower prices, accounted for 40 percent of homes sold. “That’s the main reason that’s differentiating us when you look at our sales versus some of the others out there in the industry today,” the company said on a conference call. Smaller rival PulteGroup Inc PHM.N recorded second-quarter profit that topped analysts' estimates on Thursday, but its orders dipped - the first decline in nearly three years. D.R. Horton shares rose as much as about 9 percent and Pulte dropped about 5 percent. “Affordability is important as sales prices have gone up and mortgage rates have ticked up. I think it’s the two things in concert that have contributed to a bit of the softness that we saw intra-quarter,” PulteGroup Chief Executive Officer Ryan Marshall said on a conference call with analysts. Cheaper homes will be important to buyers as interest rates rise, pushing the cost of home loans higher. D.R. Horton’s average selling price was $302,000 in the quarter, while Pulte’s was $427,000."
