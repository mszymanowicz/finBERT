32.67027193755507," AutoNation quarterly profit surges on resilient demand (Reuters) - AutoNation Inc reported an 88% surge in quarterly adjusted profit on Tuesday as the largest U.S. auto dealership chain earned more per vehicle thanks to tight inventories and robust demand for SUVs and trucks. AutoNation Chief Executive Mike Jackson said on Tuesday the shortage in supplies of semiconductors “is significant, and manufacturers can’t give us too much visibility” on how vehicle shipments will be affected. For now, Jackson said, “retailers are managing the situation through price.” Global auto sales have rebounded from the pandemic lows hit early last year as consumers increasingly prefer buying vehicles that provide more safety than public transportation during the health crisis. Jackson said he’s optimistic about U.S. car and truck demand given the combination of low interest rates, stable fuel prices and the prospect of a significant new federal stimulus package. “You can’t ask for a better environment,” he said. Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based AutoNation’s gross profit per new vehicle jumped 50% to $2,775 in the fourth quarter, while it rose 9.6% to $1,567 for used vehicles. The company set a long-term goal of increasing combined new and used unit sales to more than 1 million vehicles annually, more than double the number sold in 2020. AutoNation also said it expects to open five new stores by the end of this year and 10 additional stores in 2022. “We will do acquisitions in new vehicle franchises,” Jackson said. The company’s quarterly adjusted net income from continuing operations was $213.1 million, or $2.43 share, compared with $113.2 million, or $1.25 per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 4% to $5.79 billion, and the company said it had $2.3 billion of liquidity as of Dec. 31, 2020."

20.158786430846412," AutoNation profit jumps as strong demand, tight inventory drive prices (Reuters) - U.S. auto dealer AutoNation Inc's AN.N quarterly profit nearly doubled on Wednesday as a stronger-than-expected recovery in demand and tight inventories helped drive more profit per vehicle just months after the pandemic slammed the economy. Chief Executive Mike Jackson told Reuters he is optimistic looking ahead. Interest rates will be “very low for a long time,” he said. Low rates help consumers afford more expensive vehicles, and reduces AutoNation’s inventory finance costs. The pandemic has driven consumer demand for their own vehicles rather than sharing rides, or taking trips on a plane. “We had far more demand than supply,” Jackson said. “We have adjusted pricing to reflect that.” AutoNation said it had 43 days supply of new vehicles in the third quarter compared with 55 a year earlier. The pace of U.S. car and light truck sales has increased each month since lockdowns were lifted, on the back of strong demand for high-profit sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks amid tight inventories. AutoNation’s net income rose to $182.6 million, or $2.05 per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, from $99.5 million, or $1.10 per share, a year earlier. While overall revenue fell as the Fort Lauderdale-based company sold fewer vehicles, its gross profit per new vehicle jumped 58% to $2,533 during the quarter and rose about 45% to $1,994 for used vehicle. Total revenue fell 1% to $5.4 billion as new vehicle sales were down 11% at 65,998 vehicles during the third quarter. Used vehicle volume rose 1.6% to 64,587 units. AutoNation’s overhead costs for the quarter were 64.4% of revenue, below the company’s target of 68%. Jackson said this reflects the lower cost of selling vehicles through digital platforms. “The costs we took out are permanent,” he said."
15.413897534041821," AutoNation profit jumps on lower expenses, gain in Vroom investment (Reuters) - U.S. auto dealer chain AutoNation Inc AN.N reported a nearly three-fold rise in quarterly profit on Thursday due to lower expenses and a one-time gain on its investment in online used-car retailer Vroom. Chief Executive Mike Jackson told Reuters that retail demand for vehicles recovered throughout the quarter, and AutoNation operated “with 3,000 to 4,000 fewer employees than the same state of business would have required before” using online sales and other digital tools. About 45% of AutoNation’s vehicle sales in the quarter were largely handled online, Jackson said. Consumer demand for new and used vehicles was rebounding because of concerns about the safety of air travel and public transit, Jackson said, despite the uncertain overall economic outlook. “Customers … want personal transportation,” he said. “They want personal space they can control. That has increased demand in preowned and new.” Auto dealers have been hard hit by the novel coronavirus pandemic, with some states temporarily barring new vehicle sales. Their sales have plummeted due to stay-at-home orders aimed at curbing the spread of the virus, leaving them with no choice but to aggressively cut costs. Following a sales slump in the last two weeks of March, AutoNation placed about 7,000 employees on unpaid leave, initiated temporary pay cuts for staff and curtailed advertising expenses. That helped the company report a nearly 14% fall in expenses in the quarter and partially boost its net income from continuing operations, which rose to $279.9 million, or $3.18 per share, in the second quarter ended June 30, from $101 million, or $1.12 per share, a year earlier. Excluding the $1.82 per share gain, it earned $1.41 per share. Overall, revenue fell 15.2% to $4.5 billion as new vehicle sales were down 22.7% at 54,513 vehicles during the second quarter. Used vehicle volumes declined 5.5% to 58,920 units. The Fort Lauderdale-based company’s gross profit per used vehicle jumped 23.7% to $1,796 during the quarter. AutoNation has been investing in expanding its used-car business and branded car parts and services where margins are higher than new-car sales. The company said Thursday it plans to build 20 new AutoNation USA used vehicle stores over the next three years."

38.58847775040562," AutoNation chief sees recovery after first-quarter net loss (Reuters) - AutoNation Inc AN.N Chief Executive Mike Jackson said a recovery in consumer demand for cars and trucks has begun as states emerge from coronavirus quarantine orders, and shares of the No. 1 U.S. auto retailing chain rose after the company outperformed expectations for a tough first quarter. “The automotive recovery at retail is under way,” Jackson said in an interview. Many customers say they are buying vehicles out of concerns for the safety of traveling by mass transit and planes, Jackson said. “The next vacation, they’re driving,” he said. AutoNation said it earned 91 cents per share on adjusted basis, before $3.49 a share non-cash impairment charge. Revenue fell 6% to $4.7 billion. Analysts on average had expected quarterly earnings of 66 cents per share on revenue $4.57 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. AutoNation shares rose 5.7% in early trading Monday. Auto dealers were hit hard during the first quarter by the virus outbreak, with some states temporarily barring new vehicle sales. Sales have plummeted amid the lockdowns aimed at curbing the virus spread. AutoNation said new vehicle sales were down 10.7% at 56,739 vehicles during the first quarter, while used vehicle volumes declined 8.2% to 56,149 units. However, Jackson said business is recovering as more states have eased stay-at-home orders. As of May 8, states that accounted for 50% of AutoNation’s revenue remained under stay-at-home orders, down from 95% at the beginning of April. Same-store sales for new and used vehicles were down 20% during the last ten days of April, compared to a 50% drop during the first ten days of the month. About 45% of AutoNation’s sales are now taking place online, Jackson said. To weather the sales slump, AutoNation had put nearly 30% of its workforce, or 7,000 employees, on unpaid leave, including temporary pay cuts for staff, curtailed advertising expenses and postponed over $50 million of expenditures through the second quarter of 2020. Jackson said the company has added back about 1,000 workers as business has recovered. But with more customers shopping online, it is not clear whether the company will ultimately replace all the jobs eliminated, he said. “We’re going to take a close look, step by step, as to how we rebuild the business,” he said."

62.652391833113526," AutoNation returning $77 million in U.S. payroll assistance coronavirus relief loans WASHINGTON (Reuters) - AutoNation Inc AN.N, the largest U.S. auto dealership chain, said on Friday it will return $77 million it received in forgivable loans from the U.S. Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) meant to help struggling small businesses and employees during the coronavirus outbreak. Marc Cannon, a spokesman for the company, told Reuters that AutoNation was “clearly eligible and applied on behalf of the 7,000 employees furloughed caused by the COVID-19 crisis.” He said the company “intended to rehire all 7,000 associates under the PPP program as encouraged by the government and designed to get individuals back to work.” AutoNation has implemented cost-cutting measures, including temporary pay cuts for staff, curtailing of advertising expenses and postponing over $50 million of capital expenditures through the second quarter of 2020. On Thursday, the Small Business Administration issued new guidelines on the program and soon after AutoNation called a board meeting “and decided to cancel all PPP applications and return all PPP funds” by May 7. The loans are forgivable if companies use at least 75% on payroll expenses. AutoNation said it had planned to use all of the funds on payroll. Cannon confirmed a Washington Post report that said AutoNation had used separate tax identification numbers to apply for at least $266 million in funds for separate dealerships. Cannon emphasized the company had followed the program rules. Auto dealers have been hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic, with some states temporarily barring new vehicle sales. Sales have plummeted amid stay-at-home orders aimed at curbing the spread of the highly contagious virus. CarMax Inc KMX.N, the nation's largest used-car dealer, had said effective April 18 it was furloughing 15,500 employees, but some have been called back as stores reopen. About 60% of its locations are now fully open. CarMax said on Friday it did not apply for a payroll protection loan. On Thursday, U.S. companies began refusing government loans they were just awarded, after the Treasury Department said that publicly traded firms would have a hard time proving they really needed the coronavirus relief funds. Some large well-funded companies were granted millions of dollars from the $350 billion pool of funding, while many small, mom-and-pop shops were unable to access any funding at all, sparking public outrage. The initial PPP funding was snapped up in less than two weeks. Congress has now approved an additional $310 billion and new loans will be issued again starting next week."

The company, whose shares continued to fall for a second straight day, dropping as much as 4.5% to $32.10, declined to provide more details about the CEO’s health. Coronavirus-led lockdowns have severely hurt sales of automobiles globally as buyers postpone purchases, forcing automakers to shut production at several factories. Earlier this month, AutoNation said its sales of new and used vehicles halved in the last two weeks of March due to the COVID-19 pandemic, forcing the company to place about 7,000 employees on unpaid leave. Miller, 47, served as the company's chief financial officer before being appointed as CEO in July last year. Since joining AutoNation in 2009, Miller has led several strategic initiatives, including the building of the company's partnership with Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Waymo and helping the dealership chain achieve investment-grade status. The company said it has appointed Mike Jackson, executive chairman of board, to serve as the CEO until Miller returns.

Feb 11 (Reuters) - AutoNation Inc on Tuesday reported a 70% rise in quarterly profit, as higher demand for used vehicles helped the largest U.S. auto dealership chain offset a decline in new-vehicle sales. The quarter also included a gain of 43 cents per share related to property divestitures and a non-cash benefit related to an investment. The company’s profits have been hurt as new-vehicle sales weakened after a long bull run since the end of the 2007 to 2009 economic crisis. Chief Executive Cheryl Miller told Reuters low interest rates and a strong job market should sustain combined new and used vehicle sales at about 57 million vehicles in 2020, flat with last year. AutoNation cut its inventories by 11,000 vehicles from a year ago, and expects to hold capital spending for 2020 to a similar level as the $257 million spent in 2019, Miller said. AutoNation invested $393 million in capital spending in 2018. “We are being extremely disciplined” about capital expenditures, she said. AutoNation has been investing in expanding its used-car business and branded car parts and services, such as collision repair centers, to boost future profitability. AutoNation’s used-car and parts and services businesses, which carry higher margins than new-car sales, could help the company lessen its dependence on automakers that dictate strict terms to retailers. New-vehicle sales were down 5.1% at 74,383 units during the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, while used-vehicle volumes grew 7.3% to 59,022 units. Miller said rising prices for new vehicles will push more customers toward “nearly new” models returned from leases. AutoNation said new vehicle transaction prices have risen 15% in the past five years to $39,500. The company said its net income from continuing operations rose to $157.7 million, or $1.74 per share, in the quarter, from $92.9 million, or $1.02 per share, a year earlier.

-13.578048690667016," AutoNation profit beats estimates as used-vehicle sales offset new-auto sales (Reuters) - AutoNation Inc AN.N reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday, as higher demand for used vehicles helped the largest U.S. auto dealership chain offset declines in new vehicle sales. Chief Executive Cheryl Miller told Reuters lower interest rates were helping car shoppers afford loans and were reducing the company’s costs for carrying inventory. U.S. car and light truck sales could finish the year at about 17 million vehicles, better than expected earlier this year, she said. Rival auto retail chain Group 1 Automotive Inc last week also beat expectations, and said U.S. consumer demand for vehicles remained strong. The results come three months after the Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based AutoNation replaced its chief executive for the second time here in July. AutoNation’s profits have been under pressure as U.S. new vehicle sales have weakened after showing strong growth since the end of the financial crisis of 2008. The company has been focusing on expanding offerings such as branded car parts and services, and finance and insurance products to boost profitability. New vehicle sales were down 6.4% to 74,190 units during the third quarter, while used vehicle volumes grew 5.2% to 63,581 units. Operating profit margins on new vehicle sales declined to 4.1% from 4.3% a year ago, when AutoNation received a one-time payment from an automaker. Margins on service rose to 45.3% from 45.2%. Miller said AutoNation would continue to invest in services beyond the new car sales. The company also will continue to cut overhead costs, she said. Selling, general and administrative costs now consume about 72% of revenue, excluding charges. “Longer term I’d love to get it to 70%,” Miller said. Miller said the strike at General Motors Co GM.N had little impact. The retailer has been working to reduce inventories, Miller said. AutoNation ended the third quarter with 55 days’ supply of unsold vehicles, down from 63 days a year ago. The company’s earnings per share from continuing operations fell to $1.11 from $1.24, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.05, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. AutoNation in August warned it expected severance and other expenses paid to Carl Liebert, who was briefly chief executive ahead of Miller, to “adversely impact” third-quarter earnings by an estimated 11 to 12 cents.

Cheryl Miller, who was AutoNation’s chief financial officer, immediately replaces Carl Liebert, who will remain for 30 days to assist with the transition. Liebert assumed the CEO position on March 11, a month after his hiring was announced from financial services company USAA, where he had been chief operating officer. “We always that it would be a challenge for someone to get the auto retail business around their head and I think the conclusion was mutual that this was not the right fit,” AutoNation Executive Chairman Mike Jackson said in a telephone interview. Jackson added he was excited to announce Miller’s promotion, citing her almost 20 years of experience with automotive retail. She had been CFO since 2014 and joined the company in 2009. “I’m also am thrilled that for the first time in history we have a woman who is a CEO of a publicly traded auto retailer,” he said. AutoNation said Miller had led several strategic initiatives, including the building of the company's partnership with Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Waymo and helping AutoNation achieve investment-grade status. AutoNation also said on Monday that its second-quarter earnings rose to $100.8 million, or $1.12 a share, from $97.6 million, or $1.07 a share, in the year-earlier quarter. Revenue was essentially flat at $5.34 billion. The second quarter this year included a noncash franchise rights impairment charge of 8 cents a share.

AutoNation’s profits have been under pressure as U.S. new vehicle sales have weakened after a long bull run since the end of the financial crisis of 2008. Same-store new vehicle gross profit per vehicle sold in the quarter was $1,764, up 10% compared to the year-ago period. Same-store used vehicle gross profit was relatively flat at $1,459 per vehicle. Same-store customer financial services gross profit rose 7% to an all-time high of $1,926 per vehicle.

The company said its same-store gross profit per vehicle retailed across its 325 U.S. locations was up 6 percent to $3,559 during the quarter. AutoNation Chief Executive Carl Liebert told Reuters there remains room to improve gross profit per vehicle, including by increasing the use of AutoNation vehicle financing. “We want to make sure we are managing price and volume,” Liebert said. “There are good deals and bad deals.” AutoNation’s profits have been under pressure as overall new vehicle sales in the country have weakened after a long bull run since the end of the financial crisis of 2008. The company’s shares are up 10 percent for the year, but are well below their peak. Liebert said the Federal Reserve’s decision to pause interest rate hikes should stabilize the U.S. auto market. “That’s a really strong statement to the consumer. We don’t see the end of the earth. The industry will be high 16 million plus numbers” for the year, he said. Over the past year, the company has focused on expanding offerings such as branded car parts and services and finance and insurance products to boost profitability. AutoNation plans to open a seventh parts distribution center in May as part of a broader plan to cut the time it takes to deliver parts to its collision repair shops and dealerships, Liebert said. “A typical collison repair averages 12 to 16 days,” he said. “If we can have the highest service levels, we can take out two to three days,” increasing the number of vehicles that a shop can repair. Net income from continuing operations fell to $92.1 million in the first quarter ended March 31, from $93.3 million a year earlier.

7.117918345420369," AutoNation names new CEO as slowing auto sales hit results (Reuters) - AutoNation Inc said on Friday it has chosen insurance and financial services executive Carl Liebert to succeed longtime Chief Executive Officer Mike Jackson and lead the largest U.S. auto dealership chain at a challenging time, when the domestic vehicle market has been slowing. AutoNation reported lower-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue as it sold fewer new vehicles and gross profits on new vehicle sales declined. The company’s shares were down 3.9 percent in early afternoon trading. AutoNation’s profits have been under pressure as overall new vehicle sales have weakened. The company’s shares have fallen roughly 25 percent over the past year, and Jackson has launched restructuring actions to cut $50 million from annual costs. Liebert will take charge on March 11. He comes from USAA, where he was executive vice president for operations at the company, which provides insurance and financial services for members of the U.S. armed forces and veterans. While Liebert’s career has been outside the auto industry, he said his interest in the car business was fueled by working at a southern Indiana drag racing strip owned by his family. He told Reuters one focus will be to develop AutoNation’s ability to use customer data to expand services beyond selling a vehicle. “We can do that digitally, and through data,” Liebert said. AutoNation’s results illustrate the challenges facing the U.S. auto industry as the long recovery from the 2008-2009 financial crisis tops out. Rival publicly held dealership chains Group 1 Automotive, Penske Automotive and Sonic Automotive Inc all have suffered steep share price declines over the past year, though the three smaller chains have outperformed AutoNation since the beginning of this year. AutoNation, which has 325 U.S. locations, said net income from continuing operations fell to $92.9 million, or $1.02 per share, for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $151.5 million, or $1.64 per share, a year earlier, when it had a $41 million benefit related to U.S. tax reform. Analysts on average expected the company to earn $1.14 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Revenue fell to $5.41 billion from $5.68 billion, missing analysts’ estimates of $5.63 billion. Quarterly revenue per vehicle rose 2 percent, but gross profit per vehicle fell nearly 6 percent. Sales in California fell 9 percent, and sales of premium vehicles fell 13 percent. Jackson, who will stay on as executive chairman, told Reuters that when service and other after-sale profits are factored in, “our yield per vehicle is up. We continue to work on it diligently. It is a difficult challenge.” Tesla Inc and its electric vehicles are a challenge to established luxury vehicle brands like those AutoNation sells, Jackson said. But by 2021 and beyond, Jackson said he expects a “juggernaut” of premium electric vehicles from established automakers. “I see the pipeline from the traditional manufacturers. It’s very exciting. We will be in the electric vehicle game in a very meaningful way - 2020 is the tipping point.” For an interactive graphic on annual percentage rates (APRs) on car loans over ten years in the U.S., click: tmsnrt.rs/2V4im3M"

The tepid numbers and the change of guard come against the backdrop of a likely drop in sales of new vehicles in the United States this year, as higher interest rates and rising prices may prompt customers to delay their buying plans. Auto sales in 2018 had benefited from President Donald Trump’s overhaul of the U.S. tax laws that put more money in the hands of customers.

Analysts on average expected the company to earn $1.14 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

(Reuters) - AutoNation Inc said on Monday four senior executives including chief operating officer are leaving the company as it restructures to cut costs and expects automotive retail to be challenging this year. The top U.S. auto retailer is consolidating its regional structure from three regions to two and expects the restructuring to save about $50 million annually, it said. AutoNation said COO Lance Iserman and Chief Technology Officer Tom Conophy will leave effective immediately, while its chief human resource officer, Dennis Berger, will leave at the end of the month. Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based AutoNation appointed company veteran James Bender as executive vice president of sales. It also said Donna Parlapiano, executive vice president, franchise network, merger & acquisitions, and corporate real estate, elected to retire on Jan. 3. The restructuring comes as analysts forecast a dip in U.S. vehicle sales this year. New vehicle sales in the United States are expected to drop as higher interest rates and rising prices could prompt customers to hold off their car-buying plans, the National Automobile Dealers Association said last month. Recently, the company introduced a used-car subscription service from auto-leasing startup Fair through its network of more than 300 U.S. dealers. In October, CEO Mike Jackson told Reuters the company planned to reduce investment following an “elevated period of brand extension investment” in higher-margin service and used car operations to offset the squeeze on profits from new vehicle sales. AutoNation did not immediately respond to a query about any potential job cuts due to the restructuring."
2.6530128710270553," AutoNation to offer used-car subscription service from Fair (Reuters) - AutoNation Inc AN.N will offer a used-car subscription service from auto leasing startup Fair through AutoNation's network of more than 300 U.S. dealers, starting later this month in California, the companies said on Thursday. The service, described as an alternative to traditional ownership and leasing, is similar to new-vehicle subscriptions offered by several automakers, including Zhejiang Geely Holding Group Co Ltd's Volvo Car Corp, BMW AG BMWG.DE and General Motors Co's GM.N Cadillac. AutoNation, based in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, said the Fair service will bundle routine maintenance and roadside assistance in a monthly subscription that can be ordered through a mobile app and canceled at any time. Customers can add features such as insurance. Based in Santa Monica, California, Fair was founded in 2016 and has raised more than $1 billion in debt and equity financing. Its backers include German automakers BMW and Daimler AG DAIGn.DE, as well as Michigan-based Penske Automotive Group PAG.N, which operates a dealership network that competes with AutoNation. AutoNation Chief Executive Mike Jackson and Fair co-founder Georg Bauer had worked together at Daimler's Mercedes-Benz USA, where Jackson was president and CEO, and at Mercedes-Benz Capital Corp, where Bauer was CEO.

AutoNation’s stock has more than tripled since Jackson became CEO in 1999 after the company’s founder H. Wayne Huizenga hired him from Mercedes-Benz USA, where Jackson was president. The Fort Lauderdale, Florida-headquartered retailer has retained its No.1 position in the United States under Jackson’s leadership. His departure as CEO comes as U.S. automotive sales are cooling down after a solid run for several years following the 2008 financial crisis. AutoNation said executive search firm Spencer Stuart would support its CEO succession process."
-22.477793213391028," AutoNation starts search for a CEO as Jackson steps back Sept 19 (Reuters) - AutoNation Inc said on Wednesday it will begin a search for a new chief executive as longtime CEO Mike Jackson plans to move to an executive chairman role at the largest U.S. auto retail chain next year. Jackson has a contract to remain as executive chairman until 2021, the company said in a statement. The auto retailer’s board has hired executive search firm Spencer Stuart, and will consider internal and external candidates, the company said. Jackson told Reuters the board will run the search, but said the focus will be “on getting an outstanding leader. Everything else can be talked about,” including whether a new CEO has experience in the automobile industry. Jackson, who is 69, had been running the U.S. sales arm of luxury vehicle brand Mercedes-Benz before he took over as AutoNation’s CEO in 1999. He led AutoNation’s expansion to become the largest chain of auto dealerships in the United States with 340 new vehicle franchises in 16 states, as well as used-car showrooms and repair centers. Over Jackson’s 19 years at the helm of AutoNation, the company’s stock has gained 258 percent and outperformed the S&P 500, which has gained 127.6 percent. Most of that outperformance peaked about three years ago, however, and the stock has been a laggard since late 2015. The multi-brand, publicly traded dealership chain afforded Jackson a unique platform, from which he could challenge automakers in ways smaller dealers could not. In the run-up to the 2008 financial crisis, Jackson warned Detroit’s automakers publicly and in blunt terms that their efforts to prop up profits by building large inventories of cars and using big discounts to sell them would backfire. “Before AutoNation there wasn’t a voice of auto retail. That created a certain imbalance and tone deafness in the industry which wasn’t healthy,” he said. More recently, Jackson has contended with a decline in AutoNation’s share price, which is down 15 percent for the year, as investors have bet that the U.S. auto industry is heading for a cyclical sales slump within the next two years. Since 1999, AutoNation has repurchased roughly 85 percent of its shares. It has a market capitalization of $3.9 billion. “We use the choppiness (in the U.S. vehicle market) to our advantage,” Jackson said. “We, from strength, can repurchase our stock.” AutoNation in 2016 began refocusing investment and operations on expanding its high-margin vehicle service and repair businesses, as well as used-vehicle sales, as new vehicle profit margins contracted. Jackson also entered a multi-year partnership with Alphabet Inc’s Waymo self-driving car unit to provide maintenance and repairs for Waymo’s fleet of vehicles. Jackson said he expects his successor can use AutoNation’s scale to pursue more brand extension beyond new-vehicle sales, and develop the chain’s online presence. While major automakers except for Tesla Inc still rely on franchised dealers to deliver and provide warranty service for new vehicles, online shopping has cut down sharply the number of stores most customers visit before choosing a vehicle. Online pricing services have contributed to the squeeze on new vehicle profit margins."

-14.092256203650292," AutoNation profit gets a boost from used vehicle sales DETROIT (Reuters) - AutoNation Inc AN.N, the largest U.S. auto retail chain, on Wednesday reported a quarterly net profit that slightly exceeded analyst expectations, with high margins in its used vehicle business offsetting lower profits in new vehicle sales. The Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based company said revenue from used vehicle sales in the second quarter rose 8 percent to $1.3 billion, while new vehicle sales revenue rose less than 1 percent to $2.95 billion. AutoNation Chief Executive Officer Mike Jackson told Reuters the company’s used vehicle segment’s gross profit surged 22 percent in the quarter versus the same period in 2017, in part because the profit per vehicle was higher. The auto retail chain has focused on a branded approach to pre-owned vehicles, with prices listed online. “It’s a negotiation-free process for the consumer and the consumer has embraced it,” Jackson said. But profit margins on the new vehicle side were “very difficult, it was very competitive,” he added. “The manufacturers’ programs make it very difficult to hold margin,” Jackson said, referring to consumer discounts and rebates offered by automakers. The rise in used vehicle margins offset a 7 percent decline in gross profit for new vehicle sales, he said. The U.S. auto industry saw new vehicle sales rise slightly in the first half of the year, buoyed in part by an overhaul of the tax system and a growing economy. But new vehicle sales are expected to dip in the second half of 2018, dragged down by rising interest rates and market saturation after years of strong sales. AutoNation said premium luxury brands saw the strongest sales growth in the second quarter, rising 5.2 percent. The auto retail chain recently expanded its partnership with Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O self-driving unit Waymo, providing Waymo cars to customers in Phoenix, Arizona, to ferry them around while their own vehicles are serviced by AutoNation. AutoNation posted second-quarter net income of $97 million, or $1.07 per share, up 10 percent from $88 million, or 86 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time charges, the company posted earnings per share of $1.14, a penny above the $1.13 expected by analysts. The company said revenue rose 2.1 percent in the quarter to $5.39 billion, from $5.28 billion a year earlier. Analysts had been expecting revenue of $5.41 billion."

The largest U.S. auto retail chain’s first-quarter net profit was in line with analyst expectations. Chief executive officer Mike Jackson told Reuters that investment costs for the repair parts business, part of a broader strategy to increase AutoNation’s profits from higher-margin service and financing operations, should decline during the remainder of the year. “You will see leverage as we go deeper in the year,” he said. AutoNation said its retail new vehicle sales overall fell 2 percent in the first quarter from a year ago, and gross profits from new vehicle sales declined an average of 8.2 percent. Sales of Detroit Three brands such as Chevrolet, Ford and Chrysler were down while sales of Asian and European premium-brand vehicles increased. Jackson said AutoNation will act to reduce the inventory of vehicles it carries in response to rising interest costs for stocking cars and trucks. Jackson said he expects the shift by U.S. consumers toward trucks and sport utility vehicles that offer drivers and passengers a high seating position will continue, despite a recent increase in gasoline prices to more than $3 a gallon in some markets. “It would take $5 or 6 a gallon to reverse consumer behavior,” Jackson said. Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based AutoNation reported first-quarter net income of 93 million or $1.01 per share, down from $98 million or 97 cents per share a year earlier.
