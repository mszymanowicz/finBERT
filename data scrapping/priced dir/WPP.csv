16.350504655844798," Rapid digital switch puts WPP on path to recovery LONDON (Reuters) - The world’s biggest advertising company WPP expects its net sales to bounce back to pre-pandemic levels earlier than previously forecast thanks to the rapid global corporate switch to e-commerce and digital services. The owner of the Ogilvy, Grey and GroupM agencies was hit hard this year when firms slashed spending to conserve cash but WPP said it had now achieved an industry-leading new business performance by helping clients build e-commerce operations. WPP said on Thursday it expected its key measurement of underlying net sales to drop 8.4% in 2020 before rising by a mid single digit percentage next year and reaching pre-pandemic levels in 2022. It then expects annual growth of 3% to 4%. Chief Executive Mark Read said the business had proved more resilient than many had expected and a strategy set out two years ago to offer clients a combination of digital expertise with data and creativity had proved invaluable during 2020. “COVID has accelerated many of the trends,” he told Reuters. “The shift to digital media, the explosion of e-commerce, the importance of purpose and reputation: the fundamentals of our strategy haven’t changed but COVID forced us to accelerate it.” Analysts welcomed the statement as proof that WPP could navigate the recovery, noting that many of the financial forecasts were ahead of expectations, though they said the group now had to execute its plan properly. By mid March, WPP shares had slumped almost 60% from the end of 2019 but they have recovered steadily and were 3.6% higher on Thursday, trimming losses for the year so far to 24%. WPP’s agencies worked with brands such as L’Oreal, Ford and British retailer The Works to switch their marketing and sales platforms online rapidly as the virus forced the closure of shops. It now plans to expand its presence in the faster-growing digital and e-commerce sector by investing more, hiring new staff and making targeted acquisitions, funded by gross annual cost savings of 600 million pounds ($815 million) by 2025. The company built by Martin Sorrell also vowed to reinstate its share buyback programme in 2021 and pay a progressive dividend. CEO Read said sectors that had been floored by the pandemic, such as airlines and cruise liners, were starting to prepare for a recovery next year though momentum could change day to day. Hopes in recent weeks of a return to some normality have been driven by the launch of a vaccine but surging COVID-19 cases across Europe in the last week alone have since cast a shadow over the short-term outlook.

The British group set out its medium-term targets in a trading update that revealed its key measurement of underlying net sales had fallen by 6.7% in the two months to November, an improvement on the 7.6% drop in the quarter to end September.

The British company said its presentation of cash and overdrafts as part of notional cash pooling arrangements did not meet accounting norms, while net investment hedging was inappropriately applied against some foreign exchange exposures. WPP said in a statement that the adjustments will not impact on any of its headline measures of operating profit, net debt, net assets, net current liabilities or statement of cash flows. To mitigate its impact on future periods, the owner of the Ogilvy, Grey and GroupM agencies said it would change the cash management strategy during 2021 so that certain cash and overdrafts will be settled or offset.

While a COVID-19 vaccine would not be an immediate panacea, Read said a successful shot next year would show companies the likely path ahead, encouraging them to spend again. “It promises to be a good year overall, with a tough Q1 coming into a much stronger second half of the year,” he told Morgan Stanley’s Technology, Media and Telecoms conference. Read said he was not changing WPP’s net sales guidance for the fourth quarter. “We’re still in the range of analysts’ expectations and you know it’s possible that Q4 could be a little bit tougher than Q3,” he said. “I think Q1 next year is likely to be negative. But I do think we’ll see a pretty strong recovery in Q2, Q3, Q4 2021.” Like all advertising groups, the British owner of the Ogilvy, Grey and GroupM agencies has been hit hard by the abrupt cancellation of spending by companies desperate to save cash in the pandemic. It is now slowly recovering - its shares are up 24% in the last six months - as companies spend to build e-commerce services, and Read said its performance had been more resilient than expected. The company said in October it expected to deliver a full-year result within analyst forecasts of a drop between 8.5% and 10.7% in like-for-like net sales, with a mid-point of down 9.6%.

32.1292232986715," Uber and HSBC wins help trading improve at ad group WPP LONDON (Reuters) - Client wins with Uber, Alibaba and HSBC helped the world’s biggest advertising company WPP deliver an improvement in third-quarter underlying trading, particularly in Britain and the United States. The British owner of the Ogilvy, Grey and GroupM agencies, already rebuilding after several years of tech-led turmoil in the ad industry, is now recovering from the abrupt cancellation of spending by companies desperate to save cash in the pandemic. While businesses in consumer packaged goods, pharmaceuticals and technology have increased their spending, those in the automotive and luxury sectors are stabilising, while travel and leisure industries remain weak. Overall, underlying net sales fell by 7.6% in the three months to the end of September, an improvement on the 15.1% drop in the previous three months, and WPP said it remained on track to cut costs and hit its downgraded outlook. “Given the tightening of COVID restrictions around the world and uncertainty in the global economic outlook, we remain cautious about the pace of recovery,” Chief Executive Mark Read said on Thursday. WPP secured $1.6 billion of new business and said late on Wednesday it had extended its ties with Walgreens Boots Alliance, one of the biggest pitches of the year. Citi analysts said the improvement was all the more impressive because, unlike peers Publicis, Omnicom and IPG, WPP has a lower exposure to the United States and has also not benefited from buying assets of late. Underlying net sales were down by 5.1% in North America, compared with a 10.2% drop in the second quarter, and down 6.5% in Britain, after a 23.3% plunge in the previous quarter. As a result, the company expects to deliver a full-year result within analyst forecasts of a drop between 8.5% and 10.7% in like-for-like net sales, with a midpoint of down 9.6%. That compares with a range midpoint given in August of down 10.75%. Analysts said the results were ahead of expectations, but traders said the shares fell to a month low, down 3.5%, on the cautious outlook."

The owner of Ogilvy, Grey and Hill+Knowlton agencies declared an interim dividend of 10 pence per share and said it would relaunch its share buyback when the environment stabilises. Its shares rose 5%. WPP posted a fall in second-quarter underlying net sales of 15.1%, compared with the market consensus for a 20% drop, and it described its record of winning new work from clients as industry-leading. Chief Executive Mark Read said trading improved in July and assuming no further major lockdown, the second quarter could prove to be the nadir. “We’ve come out significantly better than we expected although we remain cautious about the outlook about the rest of the year given the economic events,” he told Reuters. WPP pulled its dividend, share buyback and 2020 guidance on March 31 as it braced for the full impact of COVID-19. Since then, many clients in travel or hospitality have scrapped marketing to save cash, but others have marketed new e-commerce channels and television commercials that once took weeks and now take 16 days to make. It said it expected to deliver full-year underlying net sales in line with market forecasts - which would be a decline of around 11% - keeping it on a par with peers Publicis PUBP.PA and IPG IPG.N in exceeding expectations. Analysts at Citi said the results should calm nerves. “We think for the stock to really start to recover, however, the group needs to see an inflection in growth in the second half,” they said.

The owner of the Ogilvy, Grey and Hill+Knowlton agencies said its actions, along with a cost cutting drive, would save around 2 billion pounds in 2020 to see it through a downturn in client spending. Chief Executive Mark Read said fallout from the coronavirus outbreak had been much more rapid than from the 2008 economic crash, hitting different sectors more quickly and leaving many companies with zero revenue and no reason to spend on marketing. “This is the period with the greatest uncertainty,” Read told Reuters. “We don’t know yet whether it will be the worst.” The pandemic, which has shut down the global economy with shopping districts deserted, sports fixtures cancelled and millions of people left idle, has come at a difficult time for the company that was founded by Martin Sorrell. In the middle of a three-year turnaround plan designed to simplify the sprawling company, trading outside of China had improved in the first two months of the year but that came to an end in March. In a sign of what could be ahead, the British company said organic sales had fallen by 16% in Greater China in January and February and while life was slowly returning to normal there, consumer spending remained depressed. Rivals IPG IPG.N and Publicis PUBP.PA have already pulled their earnings guidance for the year. To conserve cash WPP has frozen new hires, reviewed freelance expenditure, stopped discretionary costs such as travel and postponed salary increases. It will also save more than 100 million pounds assigned for property and IT costs. Members of the executive committee and board have also taken a 20% salary cut for an initial period of three months. The group, with 2019 revenue of 13 billion pounds, also had 3 billion pounds of cash at the end of 2019, and additional liquidity. “The companies that go into this in the strongest position financially will come out of it in the strongest position,” Read said. WPP said it was producing health campaigns for governments and clients around the world including in Britain where it launched an information service on WhatsApp. Public relations and public affairs advice was in strong demand. Some clients, particularly in Asia, are working on rebranding while others are shifting media spend from cinemas and outdoor to digital and TV, and pushing it back to later in the year. Analysts at Citi said the measures were prudent and the 16% drop in China not quite as bad as feared. Shares in the group were up 8%. “The good news is we will come out the other side and at the end of the day we’ll be alright,” Read said. ($1 = 0.8093 pounds)"

-17.550091075090112," WPP shares slump to lowest since 2012 as sales slide LONDON (Reuters) - WPP WPP.L shares plunged to their lowest level in nearly eight years on Thursday after a sharp slowdown in fourth-quarter trading derailed the latest recovery attempt at the world's biggest advertising company. WPP, which is in the middle of a three-year turnaround plan to counter the loss of major clients and the threat from big tech giants, also said it did not expect any improvement this year but aims to grow in line with rivals in 2021. While the results and outlook were broadly in line with WPP’s previous comments, a 1.9% fall in fourth-quarter organic sales after 0.5% growth the previous quarter spooked investors. Its shares fell 15% in early trading to 773 pence, more than 60% below their record high set in 2017 before the company lost major clients in the United States such as Ford F.N and American Express AXP.N. “It’s the first year of a three-year plan,” Chief Executive Officer Mark Read told Reuters. “We expected Q4 to be a little bit tougher and it came in in line with our expectations.” He said while the company had a string of contract reviews in 2018 and 2019 it had less work under review in 2020. “I’m confident that I’ll be able to talk to you about something very soon that is interesting,” he said, referring to a potential new global contract. “There is good momentum inside the company and we have been investing in people and talent to turn the company around.” Read, a WPP veteran who took over from founder Martin Sorrell in 2018, has been tasked with rebuilding the owner of the Ogilvy, Grey and Finsbury agencies after clients complained the company had become too unwieldy and slow in a digital age. It has also faced fluctuating spending from some of its biggest consumer goods clients and competition from tech firms such as Facebook FB.O, Amazon AMZN.O and Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google, which use their own data to target adverts. Analysts at Citi, which rate WPP shares as a “Buy”, said they had expected a weak fourth quarter but the scale of the disappointment was more pronounced than anticipated. “The impact here, to be clear, is not so much on the forecasts, where this makes limited difference, but rather on sentiment. The question now is whether the group can regain a sense of momentum as 2020 unfolds,” they said. WPP's traditional rivals have faced fluctuating fortunes, with France's Publicis PUBP.PA also being buffeted by industry shifts and American groups Omnicom OMC.N and IPG IPG.N performing more strongly. Read has responded by merging agencies, changing incentive schemes and hiring new talent in the United States. WPP said there was a slowdown in the fourth quarter across nearly all its regions and particularly at specialist agencies, where organic sales fell 7.4%. They include brand consulting and advertising, and incorporate the loss of the Ford contracts. For 2019 overall, WPP reported a 1.6% drop in organic sales, which excluded Kantar following the sale of a 60% stake in the data business to U.S. private equity firm Bain Capital for $3.1 billion. The sale helped the company cut its debt significantly. For 2020, WPP said it was aiming to match its performance last year for both organic revenue and its headline operating profit margin, which came in at 14.4%. The company’s outlook did not include any possible impact from coronavirus."

The British company, which has been hit in recent years by major client losses in North America, said despite the improving trajectory it maintained its cautious 2019 outlook because there would be twists and turns ahead. The upbeat statement shows WPP has avoided the problems ensnaring French rival Publicis PUBP.PA, which spooked markets earlier this month when it cut its sales outlook, and was moving more in the direction of the solidly performing American groups Omnicom OMC.N and IPG IPG.N. “The improvement over the quarter has come from across the board which is encouraging,” Read told Reuters. Its shares rose 4% in early trading. Read, a company veteran who took over from founder Martin Sorrell last year, has merged agencies and changed incentive schemes to provide a more streamlined service after clients complained that the owner of Ogilvy, Grey and Finsbury had become too unwieldy. Results released on Friday showed organic growth less pass-through costs, its key sales measurement, rose 0.7% in the third quarter, an improvement on the first half when it dropped 2% and against a consensus of down 0.6%. That rise included a contribution from Kantar, its market research arm which it is selling. Excluding Kantar net sales rose 0.5%. For the year it reiterated its expectation of a drop of between 1.5% and 2% and a 1.0 point drop in headline operating margin. WPP’s performance has steadily improved through the year as it recovered from the loss of work from clients such as Ford and American Express. It is hiring new staff in the United States to rebuild its creative agencies and says it is merging some operations to provide a more joined up service for customers. Net sales in North America dropped by 3.2%, an improvement on the 5.9% drop in the second quarter and 8.8% in the third. Data from Refinitiv shows sentiment around the group started to improve around this time last year, with analysts lifting their recommendations. Currently of 24 recommendations, 3 are a strong buy, 8 are a buy, 10 are at hold and 3 are a sell. The group showed improvement across all its regions, helped by contract wins in the quarter including Mondelez and eBay. Analysts at Citi said WPP still traded at more than a 20% discount to U.S. peers and the stock had room to recover. “Although the company has sensibly not decided to move up guidance at this stage (even if there is some scope for optimism), the challenge will be keeping a lid on expectations for 2020,” they said. It rates WPP a buy."

16.30964470151547," WPP poaches Sainsbury's Rogers to be finance chief LONDON (Reuters) - Advertising group WPP WPP.L has poached John Rogers, the boss of Sainsbury's SBRY.L Argos business and previously seen as a frontrunner to be the British supermarket group's next CEO, as its new finance chief. He will take over early next year from outgoing CFO Paul Richardson at WPP, the world’s largest advertising group, which is still trying to recover after a string of profit warnings. Last month it appointed Keith Weed, the marketing head of Unilever, to its board. Rogers had been seen by analysts as the favorite internal candidate to succeed Mike Coupe as chief executive of Sainsbury’s in due course. He has held several senior posts at the supermarket group over the years, including chief financial officer from 2010 until 2016. He has also worked in China, India, Japan, South Africa, the United States and throughout Europe. Shore Capital analyst Clive Black said Rogers’ move to WPP could be a sign that Coupe is staying put. “To our minds, Rogers was the prime internal candidate to replace Mike Coupe... should the incumbent boss wish to hang up his boots. With this announcement, it’s maybe the clearest smoke signal yet that Coupe is going nowhere,” Black said. Coupe, CEO since 2014, has been under pressure since Britain’s competition regulator in April blocked Sainsbury’s 7.3 billion pound ($8.97 billion) agreed bid for Walmart-owned rival Asda. That pressure has been compounded by a 30% drop in Sainsbury’s share price over the last year. Last week Coupe reaffirmed his commitment to leading Sainsbury’s, saying a major investor event he hosted was not a beauty contest for his potential replacement. Shares in WPP were up 0.8% by 0916 GMT after news of Rogers’ appointment. Sainsbury’s shares were up 1%. “His priority will be to lead a finance function that best fosters investment in creativity, technology and talent in support of WPP’s new strategy for growth,” WPP CEO Mark Read said of Rogers’ appointment. Rogers will be paid an annual salary of 740,000 pounds and will be eligible for an annual bonus of up to 225% of salary, a long-term incentive award of 300% of salary plus other benefits. He will also receive compensation for share-based and cash incentives he will forfeit on his exit from Sainsbury’s. “Joining WPP was an opportunity impossible to resist,” he said. Sainsbury’s said Rogers will leave the business on Oct. 31. It does not plan to replace him as its strategy is to bring the Argos and Sainsbury’s businesses closer together. It said Argos’s retail and logistics teams will report into Simon Roberts, the group’s retail and operations director, and Argos’s commercial team will report into Paul Mills-Hicks, its commercial director. Roberts and Mills-Hicks are also seen as contenders for Coupe’s job, along with finance chief Kevin O’Byrne."

11.788660184900102," New contract wins help WPP to improved second-quarter trading LONDON (Reuters) - New client wins including Instagram and eBay helped WPP WPP.L report better-than-expected trading in the second quarter, giving a lift both to its shares and the boss of the world's biggest advertising company. Mark Read, who took over from founder Martin Sorrell last year, has been working to simplify the group by merging agencies and changing incentive schemes after clients complained the owner of Ogilvy, Grey and Finsbury had become too unwieldy. The British company said on Friday its key sales measure - organic growth less pass-through costs - fell 1.4% in the second quarter, beating the 3% fall expected by analysts. It was also an improvement on a fall of 2.8% in the first quarter and enabled WPP to reiterate its full-year outlook. The stock, which had slumped earlier this week to a near four-month low, jumped as much as 10% in early trading and by 0845 GMT was up 6.3 percent at 973 pence. “We believe that we have the right strategy,” Read told Reuters. “There will be twists and turns on the way but we set out a three-year plan and I would say we’re now more confident that it’s the right plan.” WPP is in the middle of an overhaul after the loss of key clients and work led to several profit warnings in 2017 and 2018, the same year Sorrell quit over a complaint of misconduct, which he denied. Shares in the company fell 60 percent between March 2017 and March 2019 as it lost work from clients including American Express, United Airlines and Ford - a partner for 75 years. The stock is up 20 percent since then, slowly closing the valuation gap with U.S. rivals Omnicom OMC.N and Interpublic IPG.N which have performed more strongly in recent years. “The investment case at WPP is all about the multiple where the significant discount the group suffers vs peers ... is entirely down to the perception that WPP’s growth has permanently diverged from the peers,” analysts at Citi said. “With this in mind we think results will be taken well,” noting WPP had been trading on just nine time prospective earnings against 11 to 13 for its rivals. For the first half, group sales were down 2%, enabling WPP to reiterate its guidance for a full-year drop of between 1.5% and 2%. A company veteran, Read was forced to act after clients complained that its 130,000 staff were too slow to provide content in a digital world. He has responded by merging certain agencies such as JWT with its digital outfit Wunderman and changing incentive schemes, aiming to break down barriers and improve collaboration in a firm that was largely built by acquisitions. A disposal program, including the planned sale of a 60% stake in market research arm Kantar, is set to raise 3.6 billion pounds ($4.4 billion), enabling it to reduce debt and return proceeds to shareholders. WPP said clients had reacted well, helping it to lately win work from Centrica, InterContinental Hotels and Eurostar. Major packaged goods groups, which had curtailed their spending, are starting to invest more in the United States, he added. With restructuring completed the group will focus on investing in technology and talent. It is also making progress in the United States where it is seeking to improve its creative firepower following a particularly weak spell. While sales there were down 5.3%, that was an improvement on the 8.5% drop in the first quarter. French rival Publicis PUBP.PA cut its 2019 revenue growth guidance in July after it endured a weak second quarter in the United States. Read said WPP was not immune to global trade tensions but he believed it was on the right track to return to growth. ($1 = 0.8255 pounds)"

-0.6358599650052326," Slimmed-down WPP to net $3.1 billion selling Kantar stake to Bain (Reuters) - WPP WPP.L is selling a 60% stake in Kantar to private equity firm Bain Capital, valuing the data analytics business at about $4 billion and giving the British owner of agencies including Ogilvy and Wunderman Thompson funds to cut debt and rebuild. WPP is restructuring following several profit warnings and the abrupt departure of its founder and former chief executive Martin Sorrell over alleged misconduct, which he denies. Sorrell’s replacement Mark Read said the Kantar sale, which WPP expects to lead to proceeds of about $3.1 billion after tax and continuing investment, created value for WPP shareholders. “With a much stronger balance sheet and a return of approximately 8% of our current market value to shareholders planned, we are making good progress with our transformation,” said Read, who is in the process of simplifying the group. WPP’s clients want it to integrate its agencies and digital capabilities to produce faster campaigns across multiple platforms, at a cheaper cost. WPP said it will use about 60% of the proceeds from Kantar to cut net debt to the low end of a targeted range of 1.5-1.75 times core earnings for 2020. The rest of the money will be returned to shareholders, WPP said, adding the deal was subject to backing from investors and other regulatory and legal approvals. Read said many leading private equity companies were interested in Kantar, which was launched by WPP in 1992 and offers insights into the views of customers and consumers in more than 100 countries, and WPP was very pleased to obtain a valuation of 8.2 times its 2018 earnings. “Data is critical to WPP’s clients and critical to WPP, but there’s a growing number of sources of data,” he told reporters, adding that clients cared most about whether WPP could use data to drive marketing programs, which it would continue to be able to do with Kantar after the deal. Shares in WPP rose 0.5% to 961 pence on Friday. “Kantar has the advantage of being relatively self-contained and so can be split off from the parent with minimal restructuring costs ... the proceeds of the sale will drop straight through to the balance sheet and shareholders pockets,” Nicholas Hyett, Equity Analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said. Luca Bassi, a London-based managing director at Bain, said there were opportunities to invest in Kantar’s technology to expand its capabilities. “Market research remains the cornerstone of business decision making,” he told reporters. “All over the world all companies and industry will require more data, and more solutions to analysis and interpret that data.” The stake sale comes months after WPP said it suffered a sharp drop in first-quarter underlying sales in North America as the loss of work from clients such as Ford took a toll. WPP sold its minority stake in sports, entertainment and communications company Chime for 54.4 million pounds this month as it divests non-core assets to return to growth. It will invest in new creative staff and reduce costs by cutting offices and jobs. It also sold post-production services provider The Farm Group to Los Angeles-based Picture Shop. “With the balance sheet back in rude health, and complexity significantly reduced, WPP needs to focus on the technological and creative transformation that will be vital to its long term future in a rapidly changing industry,” analyst Hyett said. WPP said the deal and use of proceeds would be marginally dilutive to headline earnings per share in 2021."

The news puts an end to months of speculation around the heavily-contested auction which drew interest from a broad spectrum of buyout firms that are flush with cash to invest. WPP had shortlisted a series of U.S. buyout funds to submit binding bids for a majority stake in Kantar including Apollo and Platinum, Reuters reported in May. The auction, led by Goldman Sachs and part of the company’s efforts to raise cash, kicked off last year and also drew interest from European private equity houses CVC Capital Partners and Permira. In a statement on Monday, WPP said Kantar was valued at $4 billion including debt. Bain’s proposal was subject to negotiation and it was not certain the talks would result in a deal, the company said. Shares of WPP closed up 2.2% at 1,012 pence on Monday after media reports reported earlier in the day that Bain emerged as the leading bidder. Bain's interest in Kantar is the latest private equity deal to emerge in recent weeks. Blackstone and Lego's founding family on Friday took Merlin Entertainments MERL.L private in a $7.5 billion deal, in one of the biggest private equity deals in Europe in recent years. Nestle NESN.S also said in May it was in exclusive talks to sell its skin health business to a consortium led by EQT Partners for 10.2 billion Swiss francs ($10.33 billion). Kantar’s underlying sales fell 2% last year to 2.6 billion pounds with operating profit down 14% to 301 million pounds. The business generates about 15% of WPP’s overall sales and provides brand and marketing communications research for some of the world’s largest advertisers. It has traditionally weighed on WPP’s overall organic growth rates - a key measurement for the industry. Analysts say Kantar risks losing market share to more tech-savvy peers, while its business model is challenged by consumer goods companies developing their own data teams, rather than relying on surveys undertaken by external firms. First-quarter results in April showed the British company has been particularly hard hit in the United States, where a weak competitive performance in recent years has been compounded by the loss of work from Ford and others in 2018. WPP, the owner of agencies including JWT and Ogilvy, is in the middle of an overhaul following several profit warnings in 2017 and 2018 and turmoil linked to founder Martin Sorrell’s abrupt departure over a complaint of misconduct, which he denied.

The world’s biggest advertising company and its adviser Goldman Sachs are hoping to wrap up the process in late June and have given Vista access to Kantar’s books to carry out due diligence checks, the sources said. Vista, whose private-equity portfolio comprises of mostly software companies, bought U.S. technology firm Apptio last year in a $1.94 billion cash deal. Apptio provides cloud-based and hybrid business management software and its technology may fit well with Kantar, which specialises in brand and marketing communications research for some of the world’s largest advertisers.

WPP declined to comment while Vista was not immediately available for comment.

0.10270490640013415," Ad group WPP hit by client losses in North America LONDON (Reuters) - The world’s biggest advertising company WPP suffered a sharp drop in first-quarter underlying sales in North America as the loss of work from clients such as Ford took a toll on its most important market. WPP, led by company veteran Mark Read following last year’s departure of founder Martin Sorrell, said its U.S. performance was disappointing but in line with expectations. The company’s shares, which fell by more than 50 percent between a peak in March 2017 and the end of 2018 before stabilizing this year, rose 3 percent in mid-morning trading after it reiterated its full-year forecasts. WPP, the owner of agencies including JWT and Ogilvy, is in the middle of an overhaul following several profit warnings in 2017 and 2018 and the turmoil linked to Sorrell’s abrupt departure over a complaint of misconduct, which he denied. With technology transforming the way advertising is made, placed and sold, clients want WPP to better integrate its agencies so it can produce faster offerings across multiple platforms, at a cheaper cost. First-quarter results showed the British company has been particularly hard hit in the United States, where a weak competitive performance in recent years has been compounded by the loss of work from Ford and others in 2018. Read has said the group failed to invest enough in recent years in the United States, where its business was also hit by big account losses from AT&T and VW in 2016. Its U.S. sales fell by 4.2 percent in 2018 and were down 8.5 percent in the first quarter of 2019. The weak performance in the world’s biggest advertising market has meant WPP has fallen behind its nearest rivals in terms of growth, with U.S. groups Omnicom and IPG performing more strongly. Read said around three quarters of its businesses in North America has a different leadership from six months ago. “It’s not going to be quick,” he told Reuters. “It takes time for people to have an impact on the business and on clients. (But) we’ve dealt with the losses. There is much less business under review than there was this time last year.” Overall, WPP reported a drop in its main sales measurement of organic revenue less pass through costs of 2.8 percent. It reiterated its full-year forecast of a fall of 1.5 to 2 percent. Read, a softly spoken executive who had worked alongside Sorrell for decades, set out a plan in December to hire more creative staff, including around 1,000 new jobs to improve its senior leadership in its New York agencies, in a bid to steer the company back to growth. The company is also rolling out its most successful technologies across the whole group to help clients. Analysts at Citi said that while the sharp drop in the United States would catch the attention, it confirmed its thesis that WPP’s problems were “narrow/deep rather than broad”. “We think the market should take some comfort from the fact that the business excluding the U.S. actually grew by 0.8 percent in the first quarter,” it said. To help fund the turnaround WPP has put its data analytics business Kantar up for sale and is looking for a partner to take a majority stake. It said on Friday it was pleased with the level of interest. Sources familiar with the situation have told Reuters that private equity groups including CVC, Apollo and Bain are still in the process after submitting preliminary bids, while multiple parties have been knocked out of the process."

U.S. private equity funds Bain Capital and Apollo are putting the finishing touches to their rival bids and will compete with European funds CVC Capital Partners, Permira and Apax. The bidding field includes two other private equity investors, one of the sources said, without naming them. Bain Capital and Permira declined to comment while Apollo, CVC and Apax were not immediately available. The auction - led by Goldman Sachs - is gaining momentum as the deadline for first round bids looms. But private equity investors, who have been reviewing the business in recent weeks, are taking a conservative approach to valuation. Bids are expected to value Kantar at single digit multiples as the unit has suffered a decline in revenues in recent years, the sources said. Kantar is likely to fetch a multiple of seven to nine times its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $550 million, one of the sources said. If successful, WPP would fetch a top range price in excess of 3.5 billion pounds ($4.6 billion), the source said, cautioning that the final price could change after in-depth due diligence takes place. WPP boss Mark Read aims to complete the sale by the end of the summer as he needs cash to steer WPP back to growth. Read took the helm of WPP last year, pledging to spend 300 million pounds to restructure the group and bring it back in line with peers by the end of 2021. Kantar provides brand and marketing communications research for some of the world’s largest advertisers. But the impact of disruptive technologies and competition from the likes of Google and Apple has affected both Kantar and its owner WPP.

Goldman Sachs is leading a sale of the unit, which may fetch up to £3.5bn and first round bids are due in an auction process in April, the sources said. The sale is attracting interest from a number of private equity firms including Advent, Bain, Blackstone, Hellman & Friedman and CVC, according to Thomson Reuters. Bankers are readying debt packages, which could consist of a blend of senior and second lien leveraged loans or high yield bonds, denominated in sterling and euros, to back the buyout. A debt size of £2.5bn would represent around 6.5 times Kantar’s approximate £370m Ebitda, the sources said. WPP declined to comment. A sale to private equity is expected to be warmly received by bankers and investors alike in Europe’s leveraged loan and high yield bond markets, following a lack of deals so far this year. Kantar works with over half of the Fortune 500 companies, according to its website. WPP, the owner of agencies including JWT, Finsbury and Ogilvy, is in the middle of an overhaul launched by its new boss Mark Read following several profit warnings in 2017 and 2018, Reuters said.

12.822942246800292," Exclusive: Advent and Blackstone among bidders for WPP market research arm Kantar - sources LONDON (Reuters) - A series of buyout funds including U.S. firms Advent and Blackstone are in talks with advertising group WPP to explore bids for a majority stake in its data analytics unit Kantar, four sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. The sale, led by Goldman Sachs, may value Kantar at up to 3.5 billion pounds ($4.7 billion), but some private equity investors are fretting over the decline in profits and revenues that the business has suffered in recent years. Hellman & Friedman and CVC Capital Partners are also working on the deal, the sources said, while industry players have so far shied away from the process. Bain Capital has also expressed interest in making a bid for Kantar, another source said, adding Bain might later decide to team up with one of the other buyout funds in the race. WPP sent out confidential information packs this week, with non-binding offers expected in April, one of the sources said. WPP, Blackstone, Advent and CVC declined to comment, while representatives at Bain Capital and Hellman & Friedman were not immediately available. WPP, the owner of agencies including JWT, Finsbury and Ogilvy, is in the middle of an overhaul launched by its new boss Mark Read following several profit warnings in 2017 and 2018. The London-based group wants to sell a majority stake in Kantar to reduce debt as it braces for a tough year with revenue expected to drop by between 1.5 and 2 percent in 2019. Kantar, a leading player in market research, provides brand and marketing communications research for some of the world’s largest advertisers. Yet it has suffered a decline in revenue in recent years, with underlying sales down 2 percent last year to 2.6 billion pounds and operating profit down 14 percent to 301 million. “The deal poses some challenges for private equity funds as it’s been on a downward trajectory for a while,” one source said. Private equity investors are examining the turnaround potential of a possible deal, the sources said, and would value the business at up to 10 times its earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), hoping to reignite growth within the first three years of their investment. Liberum analyst Ian Whittaker said in February that Kantar could fetch more than 3 billion pounds, with WPP raising close to 2.1-2.2 billion pounds from a 60 percent stake sale. WPP boss Read aims to complete the sale by the end of the summer as he needs cash to steer the world’s biggest advertising group back to growth. Read took the helm of WPP last year, pledging to spend 300 million pounds to restructure the group and bring it back in line with peers by the end of 2021. Founder Martin Sorrell, 74, remains a major WPP shareholder but is now running a new company which last year beat WPP in the race to buy Dutch digital agency MediaMonks."

3.8220030348407272," WPP shares stage relief rally after better than feared outlook LONDON (Reuters) - WPP gained some respite on Friday as the world’s biggest advertising firm delivered results and forecasts that were not as bad as feared after a year of turmoil, lifting its shares. Rival Publicis alarmed investors with a weak showing last month and WPP warned that its underlying 2019 net sales would fall by up to 2 percent, after dropping 0.4 percent in 2018. However, traders and analysts said that was to be welcomed after a 12 month period in which the British group lost its founder and boss Martin Sorrell, 40 percent of its market value and several of its biggest clients. Shares in the group rose 7.5 percent in early trading, more than recouping the losses it suffered when Publicis spooked the market on Feb. 7. “It’s early days in what we need to do but I would say the initial signs are promising,” Chief Executive and company veteran Mark Read told Reuters. “We are at the beginning of a three-year turnaround plan, but WPP’s new positioning as a creative transformation company with stronger, more integrated, more tech-enabled agencies is already proving effective, having driven several of our recent new business successes.” Read said that the group would see particularly strong headwinds in the first half of 2019, with the whole year expected to be down between 1.5 and 2 percent. Under his plan he hopes to bring WPP back in line with peers by the end of 2021. While Publicis has struggled, posting a sharp drop off in trading in the fourth quarter, U.S. rivals Omnicom and IPG have performed strongly. WPP is facing its toughest challenge in the United States, where net sales fell by 4.2 percent in 2018. Analysts said the 2019 forecast, including a 100 basis point drop in the margin, was better than feared. WPP, the owner of agencies including JWT, Finsbury and Ogilvy, is in the middle of an overhaul launched by Read following several profit warnings in 2017 and 2018. Clients have complained that WPP, in 112 countries, is too complex due to its holding company structure where multiple networks, agencies and businesses all compete with each other to win work, meaning clients often deal with hundreds of people across the group to get one service. It is now investing to hire new creative staff while merging agencies and cutting jobs and costs. WPP said it has completed 70 of the 100 planned office mergers and shut 57 of the 80 offices that will close. Around 2,650 of 3,500 planned redundancies have been launched. It has also made 36 disposals, helping to strengthen its balance sheet. It gave no further update on its plan to sell a stake in its data analytics group Kantar. WPP has been forced to act by a change in the dynamics of the industry, shaken up by the presence of Facebook and Google, and consultants such as Deloitte, which have affected the way clients want to work with their advertising agencies. Read said the group had seen some early success after offering clients a more joined up offering, including a contract to handle Volkswagen’s creative work in North America. It also won a contract to handle creative campaigns and content for GSK’s Panadol brand, after it formed a bespoke team made up of staff from across its different pr, creative and digital agencies. “We think WPP’s shares represent value long term and that, for those investors prepared to wait ... the shares could offer considerable upside,” Liberum analyst Ian Whittaker said. “The plans ... seem more than achievable and, with the 2019 impact, not being as negative as feared, we would expect WPP shares to start to benefit from a re-rating,” he added."

The FTSE 100 and the midcap index were both 0.4 percent higher by 0823 GMT. WPP, the world’s biggest advertising company, jumped as much as 8 percent after results showed that although underlying net sales fell 0.4 percent in 2018, it was better than a forecast of a 0.5 percent dip. Friday’s rise placed WPP on course for its best day in nearly a year. News that index publisher MSCI would raise the weight of Chinese mainland shares in its global benchmarks also boosted British stocks that have a greater exposure to Asia. Luxury brand Burberry added 2.3 percent with HSBC also rising slightly. Property website Rightmove was the biggest blue-chip faller. The stock dropped over 5 percent after the company reported its slowest full-year underlying operating profit growth in nine years. Among midcaps, asset manager Jupiter Fund Management jumped 9 percent after it said its capital surplus had increased, margins were steady and costs were set to be lower in the year ahead. But hedge fund firm Man Group slipped 5 percent as its full-year results were hit by investment losses of $7.7 billion. Industrial thread manufacturer Coats Group also underperformed with a 6 percent slump as its full-year operating profit was hit by a rise in costs and it warned on current macroeconomic uncertainties. Specialised engineering company IMI advanced 4.4 percent after reporting a rise in earnings, announcing a dividend increase and a CEO change. Small-cap recruiter Robert Walters was on track for its best day in over two and a half years after it reported a jump in 2018 earnings.

7.292861404211434," WPP to splash out to reboot world's biggest ad group LONDON (Reuters) - WPP WPP.L will invest to hire new creative staff and reduce costs by cutting offices and jobs under a plan by new boss Mark Read to steer the world's biggest advertising group back to growth. A company veteran who replaced founder Martin Sorrell during a period of turmoil earlier this year, Read set out his vision after a loss of key clients lead to several profit warnings and a 40 percent slump in its market value. Read said trading had improved slightly in the fourth quarter, clients remained supportive and the dividend would be maintained. WPP will spend 300 million pounds over three years to restructure and cut costs of 275 million pounds a year by 2021. Up to 3,500 jobs will go, while it will hire around 1,000 more to improve its senior leadership in its New York agencies on Madison Avenue. The company, which employs 130,000 people, will also roll out its most successful technologies across the whole group to help clients. “We need a simpler WPP, we need to invest in the future,” Read told Reuters. “WPP has become too unwieldy, with too much duplication. It is not always as focused or as fleet of foot as it needs to be to satisfy the needs of all our clients around the globe.” WPP shares were up 5 percent at 1010 GMT, giving it a market value of 10.8 billion pounds. Analysts largely welcomed the plan but Ian Whittaker at Liberum questioned whether WPP could have gone further by cutting the dividend and slimming down more to protect margins. A target to return to the low single-digit revenue growth rates of peers Omnicom OMC.N, Publicis PUBP.PA and IPG IPG.N by 2021 indicated it will not get to those levels before then. WPP said full-year organic net sales were set to fall 0.5 percent this year, compared with an October forecast of down 1 percent, and it warned that recent account losses from the likes of Ford would provide ‘headwinds’ in the first half of 2019. Whittaker said he understood why WPP maintained the dividend, but added: “There was a case for being bold, reducing or scrapping the dividend and using the near 800 million pounds of cash savings for greater reinvestment.” Read has been forced to act after the group hit the buffers in recent years. Sorrell quit in April after a complaint of personal misconduct, which he denied. The world’s most famous advertising boss built WPP from a two-man office in central London into the world’s most powerful advertising company offering creative work, media buying, public relations, consultancy and data analytics. It outperformed rivals for years, but growth evaporated in 2017 due to competition from consultancies and tech groups Facebook FB.O and Google GOOGL.O, which enable clients to cut out the middle men and place ads directly. Clients have also complained that WPP, in 112 countries, is too complex due to its holding company structure where multiple networks, agencies and businesses all compete with each other to win work, meaning clients have to deal with hundreds of people across the group to get one service. Read, a company veteran since he wrote to Sorrell asking for a job in 1989, has sought to break down barriers between its multiple agencies, which also include PR groups Finsbury, market research firm Kantar and creative group Grey. He has merged its famous JWT ad agency with its digital outfit Wunderman, merged the Y&R creative group with digital agency VML and aligned its U.S. healthcare groups with other agencies. Structural changes made so far collectively account for 23 percent of WPP revenue. The group will also have an executive committee for the first time, drawn from corporate and company leaders, to provide better oversight of group operations, and it will review incentive schemes to align with the new strategy."

The UK’s top share index was up 0.6 percent, just holding above 7,000 after earlier testing March lows, as some investors sought out bargains and Wall Street delivered a strong comeback after heavy losses on Wednesday when the tech-heavy Nasdaq had its worst day since 2011. The more domestically focused mid-cap index also rose, closing up 0.7 percent. UK markets underperformed those in France and Spain however, as well as the euro-zone STOXX which was lifted by a batch of solid corporate results. David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets UK, reckons that’s a sign that investors are still not overly confident the wider sell-off is over given lingering concerns about Italy’s budget, slowing corporate earnings growth, rising U.S. interest rates and Brexit. The European Central Bank on Thursday stuck to its plan to roll back its unprecedented stimulus measures, even as the growth outlook continues to darken. One of the biggest comebacks in the choppy session was by struggling department store chain Debenhams. Its shares touched a new low of 8 pence after it reported a full year loss and outlined plans to shut stores before gaining 11 percent by mid-afternoon. The shares, which have plunged 80 percent this year, closed up 9 percent on the day. Lloyds Bank was also in demand, rising 1.9 percent and tracking strength across the European banking sector, after the British lender posted a higher-than-expected profit for the third quarter. “Decent performance from Lloyds, but the risks remain from its exposure to the UK market, both unsecured and mortgage lending,” said Neil Wilson, an analyst at Markets.com. The bank shrugged off fears of a no-deal Brexit and pledged to keep pumping credit into the economy regardless of the outcome of negotiations between Brussels and London. Investors punished WPP which lost as much as 23 percent at one point after a major downturn at its creative agencies in New York and London forced it to cut its sales and profit forecasts, ramping up the pressure on new boss Mark Read. “What has been interesting is that WPP’s results come after its peers – Omnicom, Interpublic and Publicis – all published Q3 updates that were well received,” Liberum analyst Ian Whittaker wrote in a note. “North America looks to be the main culprit ... but what is more concerning is that the language suggests significant client losses in Media, which is the highest margin business, in both the UK and North America,” he added. The shares later pared some losses to trade down 14 percent for its worst day in two decades, leading the fallers on the FTSE. Drugmakers were heavy fallers, too, with AstraZeneca and Shire down 2 percent and 1.3 percent respectively, making the healthcare sector the biggest drag on the FTSE. Investors shed stocks exposed to U.S. drug policy on expectations that U.S. President Donald Trump will later on Thursday detail efforts to curb drug prices. Among midcaps, Hastings Group fell 13.7 percent after the insurer warned of continuing competition, even though gross written premiums for the first nine months rose as the cost of motor insurance policies grew in Britain.

-0.20725733890980913," WPP shares plunge as ad group falls behind in post-Sorrell era LONDON (Reuters) - WPP WPP.L lost a fifth of its market value on Thursday after problems at its New York and London creative agencies forced it to cut sales and profit forecasts, showing the scale of the task facing its new boss after the acrimonious exit of founder Martin Sorrell. Mark Read, a softly-spoken veteran of the world’s biggest advertising group, said turning around WPP would take time as he sells assets, halts acquisitions and brings in new talent at its storied agencies such as JWT, Ogilvy and Y&R. The third-quarter results wiped 2.8 billion pounds ($3.6 billion) off WPP's market value, and were all the more startling as they came after solid updates from peers Omnicom OMC.N, IPG IPG.N and Publicis PUBP.PA, showing the problems are specific to the British group. The results showed the high-margin and previously strong media units that buy ad space and plan campaigns are struggling. “We need to have stronger creative agencies,” Read told Reuters. “We do have good people, we need more of them. This isn’t going to happen overnight. We need to be realistic about the speed at which the business is going to turn around.” Sorrell, the world’s most famous advertising boss, built WPP from a two-man office in central London into the world’s most powerful advertising company offering creative work, media buying, public relations, consultancy and data analytics. The group outperformed for years, helped by Sorrell's ability to buy companies and win pitches, but growth disappeared at the start of 2017 due to competition from consultancies and tech groups Facebook FB.O and Google GOOGL.O, which enable clients to cut out the middle men and place ads directly. Clients have also complained that WPP, in 112 countries, is too unwieldy, forcing them to deal with multiple agencies within the group to get one service. Some clients are also taking marketing work in-house to save costs. Analysts said it was impossible to say if Sorrell’s departure had had an effect on recent contract losses, but they noted the pressures had been building before he left in April over an allegation of personal misconduct, which he denied. “The challenges we’ve seen in the third quarter reinforce our determination to take more radical action and to move more decisively,” Read said. He will set out a new strategy in December. It will for now start by selling a stake in its underperforming data analytics group Kantar, valued as a whole at around 3.5 billion pounds by analysts. That will help to lift overall growth and add to the 16 non-core assets it has already sold, raising 704 million pounds. The efforts will help to lower its almost 5 billion pounds of debt. Sales were particularly weak in the United States and Britain, and a very poor September forced WPP to lower its full-year guidance, saying net sales could fall as much as 1 percent versus a target of 0.3 percent growth just three months ago. The operating margin is likely to fall by 1-1.5 percentage points, compared with a previous prediction of down 0.4. WPP shares were down 17 percent at 1100 GMT, taking them down 35 percent in the year to date and giving the group a market value of 11.1 billion pounds. Analysts say the stock is now inexpensive compared with peers, trading at 9 times 2019 forecast earnings compared with IPG on 13.6, but it has little momentum after a string of account losses from groups such as Ford. “WPP has delivered a proper profit warning,” analysts at Citi said. “Third quarter organic growth is materially below expectations and having raised guidance at the beginning of September the group has cut it hard today.” WPP also said Finance Director Paul Richardson would step down after 22 years in the role.

WPP, being rebuilt by new boss Mark Read, said it believed in the potential of the Kantar data analytics business but said that given its many priorities it thought it could run the unit better with a financial or strategic partner onside.

The decision is the first major move by new boss Mark Read who is reviewing the group after he took charge in September following the abrupt departure of founder Martin Sorrell. Kantar has underperformed other businesses within the portfolio owned by WPP, the world’s biggest advertising group, and analysts have speculated that it could be sold.

-21.27244612866954," Ford picks BBDO as lead creative agency in blow to Britain's WPP (Reuters) - Ford F.N has chosen Omnicom's OMC.N BBDO as its lead creative advertising agency in a symbolic blow to its partner of 75 years, WPP WPP.L. The British group, the world’s largest advertising company, is in the process of rebuilding after the sudden departure of its founder Martin Sorrell earlier this year. New boss Mark Read is planning fresh investment in the creative talent of its big agencies as the broader industry goes through a period of unprecedented change. Clients are increasingly taking work in house and using the giant online platforms of Google and Facebook to reach consumers. Named as 2018 Network of the Year at the annual Cannes awards, the New York-based BBDO replaces WPP on the creative front at Ford from November 1, while independent agency Wieden + Kennedy will also be a creative partner on some projects. WPP, which has worked with Ford since 1943, has however retained much of Ford’s most profitable work, such as media planning and buying and customer retention following a five-month review by the automaker. It also frees up the group to bid more aggressively for work with other auto makers. Its shares were down 0.9 percent at 0930 GMT. Liberum analyst Ian Whittaker said the financial impact on WPP would be limited, as it had lost only less profitable creative work, although the decision could spark questions as to whether it is the beginning of the end for WPP’s tight relationship with Ford. “The greater impact is more symbolic than anything else - Ford has been WPP’s flagship client and, with the departure of Martin Sorrell, there will be inevitable questions over whether that was a factor,” he said. Ford, the No. 2 U.S. automaker, is looking for new ideas after struggling with slumping sales, weak demand in Europe and trade tariffs with China, forcing it to cut costs. “Today is a big big day,” BBDO Worldwide said on Twitter. “We have a wonderful new brand to help build.” Like many other big ad spenders, Ford said it would also create more than 100 new in-house global marketing positions, a trend that has stripped the big advertising groups of some of their income in recent years. WPP, which had created an entire agency to support Ford, said it would continue to handle some advertising work for the car giant in the U.S., the China advertising operations, advertising for Ford’s luxury vehicle brand Lincoln and all Ford’s public relations. The sudden departure of Sorrell, who built WPP into an advertising giant through 33 years of dealmaking, prompted fears that without his contacts WPP could lose clients. Major WPP clients have put a raft of work out for review this year, putting pressure on the market leader. It has retained ties with Sky SKYB.L and BP BP.L but lost HSBC HSBA.L. WPP owns some of the most storied names in advertising, such as JWT, Ogilvy, Grey and Y&R. It combines these with data analytics, media planning, public relations and consultancy work and had outperformed peers for several years until 2017. Clients such as Unilever have also called for WPP to simplify its offering and provide an integrated service, rather than different strands of work via multiple agencies."

-28.89514502361013," New WPP boss has work to do to strengthen U.S. business LONDON (Reuters) - WPP's WPP.L new boss Mark Read vowed to invest in creative talent in the United States to strengthen its position on Madison Avenue, as he seeks to rebuild the ad group by prioritizing sustainable growth over short-term profits. Presenting the group’s first-half results after being confirmed on Monday as CEO, Read said WPP had returned to top line growth for the first time in more than a year and nudged the 2018 net sales target higher, but margin concerns set the tone. Shares in WPP, the world’s largest advertising company, fell 8 percent, the biggest loser on the FTSE 100 blue chip index, after it said the cost of returning to sustainable growth would lead to a cut in its 2018 margin outlook. The results showed the challenges facing Read as he seeks to reposition the British company in the face of cautious client spending and increased competition from Google, Facebook and consultants such as Deloitte. The group is also still recovering from the acrimonious departure of its founder and veteran CEO Martin Sorrell who left in April following a complaint of personal misconduct, which he denied. “We took a view to get the investments in now to deliver sustained growth rather than hold back on everything to make the number,” Read said of the group margin of 13.3 percent, down 0.4 points. WPP owns some of the most storied names in advertising, such as JWT, Ogilvy, Grey and Y&R. It combines these with data analytics, media planning, public relations and consultancy and had outperformed peers for several years until 2017. But the market leader has been hit particularly hard in the last year as the broader industry goes through a period of unprecedented change, with clients using the giant online platforms of Google and Facebook to reach consumers. WPP clients such as Unilever and Ford have also called for WPP to simplify its offering, to provide an integrated service via fewer people, while some clients are taking their digital media buying inhouse to save money. All of these trends are applying pressure. The greatest pain is being felt in the United States where a fall in net sales accelerated in the second quarter, down 3.3 percent compared with the 2.4 percent fall recorded in the first four months of the year. Read said the traditional advertising agencies and data analysis groups in the United States were particularly struggling as big companies such as packaged goods group P&G reviewed how much they spend. “We have to reposition our networks and strengthen the creative agencies,” he told Reuters. “We need to invest more in creative talent there and strategic talent. Sometimes when you’re faced with cost cuts you take the wrong people out. So we need to make sure we have the best businesses in those areas.” Read has promised to update the market on his broader strategy for the group by the end of the year, after he started selling some joint venture holdings to pay down debt. Analysts described the results as a mixed bag, with the return to first-half net sales growth of 0.3 percent overshadowed by the warning that the full-year profit margin would be in line with the first half, down 0.4 points. “Despite the shifting sands, WPP has delivered a robust first-half performance,” said Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor. “Nonetheless, there are concerns for the group, some of which have been inherited. There is something of a struggle within parts of the brand consulting unit, and the United States in particular, which is slightly alarming given the strong current growth being seen in the world’s largest economy.” At 0915 GMT, the shares were down 6 percent, valuing WPP at 15.2 billion pounds and putting it on track for its worst day since 2011. They have now lost 15 percent in the last year as investors were discouraged by weak financial results and, until recently, uncertainty about the group’s leadership after Sorrell. The results keep WPP in the strugglers' camp, alongside peers Omnicom OMC.N and Publicis PUBP.PA while earnings reports from New York-based IPG IPG.L and Japan's Dentsu have looked more buoyant.

-25.255594901522553," Ad giant WPP names Read as CEO for post-Sorrell era LONDON (Reuters) - WPP named company veteran Mark Read as its new CEO on Monday to steer the world’s biggest advertising company through a period of unprecedented change and following the acrimonious exit of its founder Martin Sorrell. The 51-year-old takes charge of the $21 billion company at a tough time following a year-long sharp downturn in trading sparked by competition from Google and Facebook and pressure from clients to simplify the business and cut pricing. He also knows that Sorrell, still a major WPP shareholder and his one time mentor, will be looking over his shoulder. Sorrell wrote to Read and his new chief operating officer Andrew Scott on Sunday to wish them well, encourage them to work together and explained the challenges ahead as he saw them, a person familiar with the matter said. Sorrell, 73, has already set up a new company which in July beat WPP in the race to buy a Dutch digital agency. The softly-spoken Read, who joined WPP in 1989, said on Monday the industry was going through “structural change, not structural decline” and that he planned to rejuvenate WPP by combining the power of its creative agencies with improved technology and analytics. “It is a challenge that we’re keen to get on with,” he told Reuters. “What makes WPP special apart from its people is the power of creativity, imagination and ideas but we need to combine that with an understanding of how technology is reshaping our industry,” he added. Read was seen as the leading internal candidate after he spent almost nine years on the board up to 2015. He has worked on strategy, client retention and digital operations since he wrote to Sorrell asking for a job almost three decades ago. In April he became joint chief operating officer with Scott. WPP said on Monday that Scott would continue in that role while Roberto Quarta has resumed his role as non-executive chairman. Senior colleagues, former executives and analysts have told Reuters they believed Read’s proven track record from running the WPP digital agency Wunderman combined with his knowledge of the sprawling business made him the right man for the job. Zaid Al-Qassab, the chief brand and marketing officer at WPP client BT, said he was delighted that Read had got the job. “He always worked well with Sir Martin and has shown himself to be a shrewd, thoughtful operator,” he said. “Mark’s always impressed me with his understanding of clients, the industry and with his personable nature. He’s not in any way what you’d consider a corporate type and it shows in how he tackles problems and builds relationships.” Sorrell, the driving force behind WPP, quit in April over a complaint of personal misconduct, which he denied. WPP, which has been dogged by investor rebellions over the size of Sorrell’s pay, said Read would receive an annual salary of 975,000 pounds ($1.25 million) and an annual bonus at 250 percent of salary plus a long-term incentive scheme. In 2017 Sorrell had a base salary of 1.15 million pounds plus long-term incentive schemes that have, over the years, paid out tens of millions of pounds. Read takes over a company that spans the globe and through some of the most storied names in advertising, such as JWT, Ogilvy and Grey, provides adverts along with market research, media planning, public relations and data analytics. WPP is looking to get back ahead of its peers Omnicom and IPG in the United States, France’s Publicis and Havas and Japan’s Dentsu. The British group largely outperformed the market for years but lost its way in 2017 with organic growth disappearing. Analysts say WPP owns some of the best assets in the business but in recent years clients such as Unilever have called for it to restructure so they can deal with fewer agencies and staff and receive a more cohesive service. Executives within WPP said there was already a different tone. “He knows the business as well as anyone, having been at the right hand of Martin all this time,” the head of one of WPP’s businesses said. “He’s the total advocate of collaboration. What he did at Wunderman was incredibly successful,” he said in reference to a strategy of broadening the group from its initial focus on direct marketing that helped to win some big clients. Read has a chance to start to win over the financial community when he presents first-half results on Tuesday. The company has been given a boost by winning six of eight pitches since April, including Mars, Adidas, Mondelez and Shell. While that won’t feature in Tuesday’s numbers it does give the group a lift in a year when it has said it does not expect to grow net sales. He has also disposed of some minority assets and said there would be more news on that on Tuesday. ($1 = 0.7771 pounds)"

-32.03301646725081," Out of Sorrell's shadow, Mark Read poised for top job at ad giant WPP (Note strong language in final paragraph) LONDON (Reuters) - The unassuming Mark Read will embark on the unenviable role of running WPP WPP.L this week, tasked with reshaping a group at the center of seismic industry change following the departure of the world's most high profile advertising boss Martin Sorrell. Read, a 51-year-old with experience across strategy and digital operations, is expected to be named WPP’s second-ever CEO in the coming days after persuading the board he had what it takes to lead the world’s biggest advertising company. Sorrell quit the British group in April following a complaint of personal misconduct, which he denied, and after a year-long sharp downturn in trading sparked by cautious clients and competition from Facebook, Google and new consultants. Read, appointed to run the business as a joint chief operating officer until a permanent CEO was found, told Reuters in June that WPP needed radical change to remain relevant to clients but that they could evolve their way there, suggesting a review of some assets but no major break up. Clients, current and former WPP executives and analysts have told Reuters they also expect a program of evolution not revolution, slowing down the hunt for acquisitions and re-engineering the agencies to provide a more joined up service. “For any leader coming into any business the most important thing is to have respect,” Jon Williams, a former chief creative officer at WPP agency Grey, told Reuters. “Because of Mark’s operational delivery and because he’s got a personal relationship with a lot of the business leaders, he’s got that respect. He can hit the ground running.” Sorrell built the world’s biggest advertising and marketing services company by taking over some of the most storied names in the industry - JWT, Grey, Ogilvy and Y&R - and combining them with PR agencies, market research and media planning groups. Headquartered in London, it now owns some 400 businesses around the world, set up to compete with each other for work. That has fallen out of favor with clients, however, as they want fewer teams providing an array of complimentary services, rather than multiple teams and multiple strands of work. Sorrell had already talked about the need to break down barriers but Read is expected to go further. He and his co-chief operating officer Andrew Scott have been asking WPP executives what works and what doesn’t since they stepped up in April. “He’s listened, he’s gone out of his way to make sure people understand that he wants to be collaborative, that he’s a peer,” the CEO of one WPP agency, speaking to Reuters on the condition of anonymity, said. “He knows the business as well as anyone, having been at the right hand of Martin all this time. And he knows that the solution to our future is not these acquisitions that keep feeding the growth.” Read, a father of two young children, strikes a very different pose to Sorrell, who he wrote to asking for a job in 1989. Where Sorrell was an outspoken CEO, commenting on everything from the Chinese economy to influencers on Instagram, the softly-spoken Read adopts a lower profile, trying to avoid photographers at the end of the recent annual general meeting. Like Sorrell a graduate of Cambridge University and Harvard, Read is described by colleagues as a good listener and delegator, with no obvious ego. When talking to journalists he takes time to think before answering questions. The chief marketing officer of one of Britain’s biggest companies said Read should not be underestimated. He relayed how Read, when running WPP digital agency Wunderman, had approached him to explain what he could provide if and when they next put their ad contract out to tender. He stayed in regular touch - a job normally farmed out to more junior staff - and 18 months later Wunderman won the deal. “He is an incredibly personable collaborative, non-aggressive individual who prefers to work through his acumen, his intelligence, his intellect, not through his relationship and networks,” the CMO said. “He’s more shrewd than you may at first realize when you get the soft handshake and mild manner. Don’t be fooled.” Read will need all his acumen to hand when he takes over the top job, perhaps on Tuesday when WPP publishes first-half results, knowing that Sorrell, a large WPP shareholder, will be watching after he launched a new competitor. According to those spoken to by Reuters Read will be met by a groundswell of good will. The WPP agency CEO said: “For the first time since I’ve been here I got an email from the person in charge of the company that began with: how are you doing? “And I was like: holy shit, because he actually wanted to know.”"
-32.2131100398639," WPP set to name internal favorite Mark Read as new CEO: source LONDON (Reuters) - WPP WPP.L will name its unassuming former digital boss Mark Read as its new chief executive, tasked with turning around the world's largest advertising group in the wake of Martin Sorrell's departure, a city source told Reuters. Read was seen as the leading internal candidate to become CEO after he spent almost nine years on the board from 2006 to 2015. He has also worked on strategy, acquisitions and digital operations since he wrote to Sorrell asking for a job in 1989. The city source, who declined to be named because the decision is not yet public, said Read would be given the job as long as the two sides have agreed terms. Due to publish results next Tuesday, WPP declined to comment. Read stepped up to become WPP joint chief operating officer in April after Sorrell, its founder and the world’s most famous advertising man, quit after 33 years in charge following a complaint of personal misconduct which he denied. He takes over the 16 billion pound company at a difficult time, as the industry goes through a period of unprecedented change as clients seek to save costs by doing some digital marketing themselves and others turn to consultants for advice. Others are placing ads directly on Google and Facebook, cutting out the middlemen advertising groups. The group had outperformed its peers - Omnicom OMC.N and IPG IPG.L in the United States, France's Publicis PUBP.PA and Havas and Japan's Dentsu 4324.T - for years but lost its way in 2017 with organic growth disappearing. Clients have told Reuters they hugely value WPP’s work but they want the group to be streamlined. Operating in 112 countries, WPP has 400 separate agencies that provide everything from pure advertising to media planning strategies, data research and PR. Those 400 agencies have traditionally competed with each other, meaning clients can deal with multiple different agencies. They now want those agencies to work together to provide a more simplified service. Read told Reuters in June that WPP needed radical change to stay ahead of the digital revolution reshaping the industry. Some moves are already evident - the group is moving its headquarters, has revamped its website to provide a more sleek message and clients and WPP executives have told Reuters they’ve seen a more collaborative approach from the top. Married with two young children, Read had been the popular option among senior and junior members of WPP staff spoken to by Reuters.

That building may not be large enough for all the staff in the parent company however and the long-term ambition is for all staff to work together, the person said, indicating that that may be temporary. The move, taken by joint chief operating officers Mark Read and Andrew Scott, marks a fresh start for the group after Sorrell took on Farm Street and its warren of corridors and low ceiling offices in 1987 as part of his acquisition of JWT. Sorrell, one of Britain’s most high-profile businessmen, quit the group in April after it said it had investigated an allegation of personal misconduct made against him. Sorrell denied subsequent reports he had visited a prostitute and paid using company money when asked about his exit from WPP at the Cannes Lions advertising festival in June. The company is expecting to announce a new chief executive in early September, with Read seen as the leading candidate. Advertising title Campaign was the first to report the news. A spokesman for WPP declined to comment."

A spokesman for WPP declined to comment. WPP, the world’s biggest advertising group, is in the midst of a leadership change. Founder Martin Sorrell left in April following a complaint of personal misconduct. Executive Chairman Roberto Quarta said last month that the search for Sorrell’s replacement was well-advanced. The China deal, which could take several months to conclude, would see WPP pool its Chinese agency operations into a new holding company and retain majority ownership and control, Sky News said. The report said the deal had been brewing since before Sorrell left, and that Quarta went with co-chief operating officer Andrew Scott to China this month to continue talks."

-11.956986305366426," Tempers flare as Sorrell beats WPP in battle for Dutch agency LONDON (Reuters) - Martin Sorrell beat WPP WPP.L in the race to buy a Dutch digital agency on Tuesday, infuriating his former company and revealing the animosity raging between the two sides. Sorrell left the world’s biggest advertising group WPP in April over a complaint of personal misconduct. Leaving without a non-compete clause, he set up a new company weeks later and took on his former firm in a bid battle for the agency MediaMonks. Incensed, WPP had warned Sorrell that he would lose his multi-million pound share awards if he did not back off, arguing that their former CEO and founder had known about its interest in the agency before he left. Having consulted lawyers, the world’s most famous advertising man pressed on regardless through his new vehicle, S4 Capital. “WPP’s lawyers wrote to Sir Martin’s lawyers last week pointing out the breach of Sir Martin’s confidentiality undertakings in his approach to MediaMonks after his resignation from WPP,” a spokesman for the FTSE 100 company said. “Despite subsequent protestations from Sir Martin’s lawyers, we are well aware of the facts and he has jeopardized his LTIP entitlement.” Sorrell, who built WPP from a two-man operation into the world’s largest advertising group with over 200,000 staff in 112 countries, had been entitled to share awards worth up to 20 million pounds in future payments as part of a long-term incentive plan. That is now in doubt after he agreed a 300 million euro deal to buy MediaMonks, a digital agency that employs more than 750 people in 10 countries to create content and campaigns for clients including Adidas, Amazon, Google, Netflix and Hyundai. WPP had been interested in acquiring the firm, along with other industry rivals such as Accenture Interactive. A person familiar with WPP’s thinking said they had baulked at the price. “S4 Capital seems to have abandoned commercial considerations in its desperate pursuit of landing the asset,” the source said. Sorrell said the deal represented the first move by S4 Capital to create a “new era, new media solution embracing data, content and technology”. The Briton is seen as the godfather of the advertising holding companies that have dominated the industry for decades, providing strategy, media buying, research and data analytics. In recent years, however, many clients have complained that these groups are now too slow to meet their needs in a digital world. WPP, with a market cap of 15 billion pounds and more than 400 separately-run agencies, has said it needs radical change. Starting from scratch, Sorrell says his new business will be built to create content for clients where and when they need it. As he makes more acquisitions the group will be run on a unified basis on one set of accounts, to encourage collaboration. MediaMonks was bought with shares and cash, with the owners of the agency set to own around 20 percent of the new group. Unlike many media deals, the owners will not receive an earn-out, in a bid to keep them within the company and incentivized to help the wider group succeed. Sorrell will now work to broaden the platform and develop further capabilities such as data analytics and digital media buying. He is also keen to enter Germany and India, either through organic growth or acquisition. A source close to S4 Capital had told Reuters last week that they saw the WPP warning as an attempt to disrupt their bid and were satisfied with the legal advice they had received."

Sorrell’s S4 Capital had taken on the company he founded, WPP, in the battle for the Dutch group, prompting his former employer to warn that he could lose his multi-million pound share awards if he did not back off. Sorrell said on Tuesday that S4 Capital would merge with MediaMonks, giving the company’s owners shares in the new venture plus cash and no earn out. It did not put a price on the deal.

WPP lawyers have written to the 73-year-old to warn him he is at risk of losing share awards that could be worth 20 million pounds ($26.5 million) if he breaches confidentiality obligations, the person said. The letter comes as WPP competes with Sorrell’s new venture, S4 Capital, in the race to buy Dutch digital agency Mediamonks. Sorrell left WPP without a non-compete clause. A source close to S4 Capital said it viewed the letter as a mischievous attempt to disrupt its bid. The source added that investors in S4 were aware of the issue and the company had taken legal advice. Sorrell left WPP in April and then announced his comeback just six weeks later with a plan to return to the London stock market through a reverse takeover involving listed shell Derriston Capital and S4 in a deal that is yet to complete. He said at the time that he planned to “build a multi-national communication services business focused on growth” and it has since emerged that he is pursuing Mediamonks which could be worth at least 250 million euros ($292 million). Sorrell, one of Britain’s most high-profile businessmen who founded WPP, quit the advertising group after the FTSE 100 company said it had investigated an allegation of personal misconduct made against him. Sorrell denied subsequent reports he had visited a prostitute and paid using company money when asked about his exit from WPP at the Cannes Lions advertising festival last month. Derriston said on Wednesday it was asking permission from investors to issue as many as 1 billion shares at a minimum price of 1 pound-a-share that it would use to buy S4. It wants the authority to issue the shares in case Sorrell has grown S4 through acquisitions before the reverse takeover with Derriston has gone through. Sorrell is expected to inherit the ability to issue the shares, if they have not all already been required as part of the reverse takeover, once he takes charge of the business, a spokesman for Derriston said."
-7.271607315524903," Former WPP boss Sorrell denies prostitute allegation CANNES, France (Reuters) - Former WPP WPP.L boss Martin Sorrell denied on Friday that he had visited a prostitute and paid using company money when pressed on a stage in front of hundreds of people about why he had left the advertising giant he founded. Sorrell, speaking on the main stage at the Cannes Lions advertising festival, was asked by the New Yorker journalist Ken Auletta about reports in the Wall Street Journal and Financial Times that a colleague had reported him to WPP management for using a prostitute. Sorrell initially referred to a denial made by his spokesman but when pressed to go further, he said: “It’s not true.” The 73-year-old quit WPP in April after the company said it had investigated an allegation of personal misconduct but neither Sorrell nor the company have given any details about the nature of the complaint. The departure of the world’s most famous advertising executive and one of Britain’s leading businessman has prompted much speculation over why he stood down, including a lengthy report in the Financial Times which also said he had acted aggressively toward staff. Asked about how he treated staff, Sorrell said he demanded high standards but did not think the newspaper description was fair and that he had received numerous messages of support from former colleagues. He said he quit because he thought it was the right thing to do for the company he founded more than three decades ago and which now has 200,000 employees. He was on stage at the annual advertising conference -- where for years he held court -- to interview Auletta about his new book on the industry, Frenemies. After discussing the rapid change in the advertising world, Auletta said he needed to address the “elephant in the room” -- the reasons why Sorrell had felt compelled to leave WPP. Asked whether he had visited a prostitute, Sorrell said: “We’ve dealt with that by strenuously denying it.” “So it’s not true?” Auletta asked. “It’s not true,” Sorrell replied. “I felt the situation had become untenable and I felt it was in the best interests of the share owners, the clients, the people inside the company,” he added, explaining why he left. Sorrell’s exit sparked an investor backlash at the recent WPP annual meeting after it emerged he had left with share awards potentially worth up to 20 million pounds ($26.6 million) and without a non-complete cause. He has already started a new venture after buying into a listed shell company and raised 150 million pounds from external investors to make acquisitions. Sorrell was later asked at a press briefing in Cannes whether the nature of the allegations would deter those new investors. “We’ll see in time,” he said three times, when pushed by a journalist."
-6.591228644253086," Ad man Sorrell takes aim at WPP over his exit on Cannes stage CANNES, France (Reuters) - WPP WPP.L founder Martin Sorrell rounded on the board of the advertising giant he founded on Thursday in his first major public appearance since quitting as chief executive in April. Sorrell, 73, has denied an allegation of personal misconduct which led to his departure from the world’s biggest advertising company. Neither Sorrell nor the company have given any details about the nature of the complaint. “The most damaging thing that happened during the course of those events... was the leak over the Easter weekend at the very top of the company, and which to my knowledge there has been no investigation whatsoever,” Sorrell told a packed event in Cannes organized by The Drum publisher. His rapid exit followed decades of success at WPP which brought great wealth for investors including Sorrell, who earned around 200 million pounds in the last five years alone due to a performance-linked bonus scheme. Sorrell said he had asked WPP to conduct an investigation into how the allegation had leaked to the Wall Street Journal. “There has been no investigation to my knowledge of how, why and what the leak consisted of and I think that is a fundamental flaw,” Sorrell said in Cannes, adding that he had requested one. A spokesman for the company declined to give any further details but said:”WPP takes confidentiality very seriously and is acting appropriately.” Sorrell added that while WPP says it treats all of its 200,000 employees equally, he did not think this was the case. “I would disagree violently with that premise, not all employees have been treated equally,” he said. The departure of the world’s most famous advertising executive prompted speculation as to why he left, including a Financial Times report that he could be aggressive towards staff. Sorrell described the allegations as “scurrilous and salacious”. “Am I the easiest person in the world to get along with, you know very well that sometimes I can be difficult, but I would always say difficult with justification,” he said, looking relatively relaxed, in a t-shirt and jacket. “If it is a fault to demand or expect superior performance or for things to go well, mea culpa.” Mark Read and Andrew Scott were appointed to run WPP in the interim after Sorrell quit, with Read focused on running the agency business, while Scott handles its finances. Sorrell, a 2 percent shareholder in WPP, said the chairman had said he wanted to maintain stability, which he took as a signal that it would appoint an insider. Sorrell said he would back the two men to become joint CEOs if this was the case. “I’m not saying two individuals because nobody could replace me individually, but those two individuals have complementary skills,” he told ad executives and journalists who had flocked to a small Irish pub on the Cannes waterfront to hear him. “One on their own would not be sufficient in my view but two together can be a very powerful and potent combination.” WPP has had to defend its handling of the departure after it emerged that Sorrell had left with share awards worth potentially 20 million pounds and without a non-compete clause. He has since set up a new venture, S4 Capital with a pool of 150 million pounds from outside investors and acquired a listed shell company, repeating his formula from the 1980s when he used a then little-known firm called Wire and Plastics Products to buy some of the biggest ad agencies in the world. Sorrell said he expected to work for the next seven years and then assess whether he wants to go on with a new cycle. And outlining his position in the rapidly changing industry and what he wanted to achieve, he likened his new venture to a peanut. He noted that some people are allergic to them."
-6.591228644253086," Sorrell hits out at WPP over handling of his sudden departure CANNES, France, June 21 (Reuters) - Martin Sorrell, the recently deposed founder of advertising giant WPP, hit out over his treatment from the board of the British company on Thursday at his first major public appearance since he quit in April. The 73-year-old left the world’s biggest advertising company in April over an allegation of personal misconduct which he has denied. However neither Sorrell or the company have given any details about the nature of the complaint.

-7.218648130750221," Sorrell's heir apparent flags need for radical change at WPP CANNES, France (Reuters) - WPP WPP.L needs radical change to stay ahead of the digital revolution reshaping the industry and its clients, the man now steering the world's largest advertising group said. The once glamorous world of Madison Avenue has been forced to confront reality in recent years as the rapid growth of digital platforms opened the industry to new competition at a time when clients are questioning everything they spend. As the biggest holding company in the sector, WPP has been particularly hard hit, losing major contracts, almost 30 percent of its market value and in April, its founder and chief executive Martin Sorrell over a personal misconduct allegation. Sorrell has denied any wrongdoing and the company has not divulged the nature of the complaint against him. The softly-spoken Mark Read, WPP’s former digital boss, has been appointed to run the company of 200,000 employees as a joint chief operating officer in the short term, charged with reviewing its structure while keeping staff and clients onside. “In five years time the business should look radically different but we can evolve ourselves there,” he told Reuters at the annual Cannes Lions advertising festival where ad and tech companies go to meet the world’s biggest marketing spenders. The exit of the 73-year-old Sorrell came at a momentous time for the industry, as Google and Facebook threaten to cut out middlemen ad agencies and as new challengers like consultants battle to win high-margin strategic and advisory work. Read says the world’s biggest companies are not questioning the value of spending on their brand or message, rather they are changing how they target consumers in a world of mass, but fragmented, content. “Just like us, clients realized that they needed to more radically examine their costs,” he said. “They’re not demonstrating a lack of commitment in marketing or marketing spend, they’re shifting it from what they used to do to what they want to do in the future. “In the same way, we need to position WPP to capture the spend of the future.” Major clients have made clear they no longer want to work with multiple people across multiple agencies to secure market research, data analytics and public relations services, plus ads on multiple platforms. WPP's rivals Omnicom OMC.N, Publicis PUBP.PA, IPG IPG.N and Dentsu have been less affected so far than the British-based company which owns more than 400 agencies, traditionally set up to compete with each other. Read, long seen as a successor to Sorrell after he wrote to him asking for a job in 1989, said he had spent recent weeks talking to colleagues and clients and said WPP would do better at incentivising one-time competitors to work together. The scale of the challenge is huge, however. After ploughing billions of dollars into online advertising, major brands are now demanding more transparency on how their money is spent, and evidence on how it leads to a transaction. Clients, under pressure from the digital forces weighing on their own operations, are demanding greater efficiency, particularly consumer goods groups like Unilever and P&G that are served by WPP. “If you look at the production of content, clients don’t want a 5 percent reduction in the cost, they want an 80 percent reduction,” he said. “So it’s about redirecting resources and sometimes that requires a more radical examination of your cost to take the legacy cost out and redirect it to the future.” Read admits the company, present in 112 countries, is in a transition phase. He is working with fellow COO Andrew Scott to review the structure, but WPP is unlikely to embark on a major new strategy until the next CEO is in place. Much of the talk at the annual industry event has been dominated by the travails at WPP and who should take over, with P&G’s marketing boss Marc Pritchard and Verizon’s Tim Armstrong also seen as candidates. The unexpected departure of Sorrell, the world’s most famous advertising man who was rarely out of the headlines, has catapulted the 51-year-old father of two, Read, into the spotlight. He describes the last 10 weeks as “eventful” and says WPP now needs leadership. Less showy than his former boss, Read thought for some seconds before saying he was enjoying the job, and that he didn’t accept the view that traditional advertising was doomed. “It’s a challenge,” he said, on the terrace of one of the major hotels that look over the seafront, wearing shorts and a t-shirt. “Running a company like WPP, to some extent you need to lead from the front, and I’m happy to lead.”"
-10.69681506934966," Norwegian wealth fund backed Sorrell's farewell pay at WPP AGM OSLO (Reuters) - Norway's $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund, the world's largest, supported the farewell pay package of Martin Sorrell, the former CEO of advertising firm WPP WPP.L, voting records show. The most famous advertising executive in the world quit the marketing giant he built from scratch in April following an allegation of personal misconduct, prompting concerns among some investors over the handling of his departure. Nearly 30 percent of shareholders opposed WPP’s executive pay proposal at the company’s annual general meeting on Wednesday. These included share awards to Sorrell that could be worth 20 million pounds, although they are expected to be well below that due to recent underperformance. Norges Bank Investment Management (NBIM), WPP’s seventh largest owner with a two percent stake according to Thomson Reuters Eikon data, voted in favor however, and also backed the re-election of chairman Roberto Quarta, which was opposed by almost 17 percent of shareholders. The fund, which frequently opposes pay deals it considers too complex or otherwise in breach of its guidelines, did not elaborate on its vote. In March, NBIM voted against stock option grants to Tesla TSLA.O boss Elon Musk, and recently voted with activist shareholders at Facebook FB.O, Alphabet GOOG.O and Dassault Aviation AVMD.PA on issues ranging from share buybacks to transparency and appointments. Voting records from the last five years show NBIM backed all management proposals at meetings of WPP shareholders."
-7.168095383880728," Sorrell haunts WPP as shareholders rebel over farewell package LONDON (Reuters) - Angry WPP WPP.L shareholders rebelled on Wednesday at an annual meeting dominated by differences over the departure of the advertising firm's former chief executive Martin Sorrell. The most famous advertising executive in the world quit the marketing giant he built from scratch in April following an allegation of personal misconduct, prompting concerns among some investors over the handling of his departure. This was reflected in voting at the AGM, where nearly 30 percent of WPP shareholders opposed its executive pay proposal. This included share awards to Sorrell which could be worth 20 million pounds, although they are expected to be well below that due to WPP’s recent underperformance. Almost 17 percent of investors also declined to back the re-election of its chairman Roberto Quarta, under whose watch, Sorrell left with the share awards and without a non-compete clause. The 73-year-old almost immediately set up a new venture. The departure of one of Britain’s best known businessmen rekindled arguments that have long dogged WPP meetings - that it paid him too much and did not prepare for his succession. Sorrell earned around 200 million pounds ($268 million) in the last five years alone. In 2016, a third of WPP’s investors refused to back his 70 million pound pay package. Described by one private investor as the “elephant in the room”, Sorrell dominated the debate with investors asking why he had left, why the company had not prepared for his departure and why he had been allowed to keep his share awards. “What will the strategy be because Martin was so key to this, and he’s no longer here?” another private investor asked, while a third questioned why the chairman had not launched the meeting with a tribute to WPP’s founder. Quarta told reporters after the hour-long meeting that he had acknowledged Sorrell on his departure and “didn’t think it was necessary” to do so again. “No one man is the company,” he added. The nature of the complaint against Sorrell has not been disclosed. He has denied any wrongdoing and the chairman said there was nothing more he could say on the matter. “I know that questions remain, but there is simply nothing further we can legally disclose,” Quarta told investors. Quarta defended the company’s response to the allegation, saying it was robust from a governance and legal perspective. While he accepted criticism over future share awards, he noted that these pre-dated the current board and said no one had expected Sorrell to leave so quickly and that his priority after joining in 2015 had been to renegotiate Sorrell’s pay before seeking to tie him in to a more typical contract. “It was a timing issue,” he said. Whoever takes over WPP faces an uphill task after the group and its more than 200,000 staff started losing ground to rivals. It delivered its worst annual sales performance since the financial crisis in 2017 after being squeezed by tech giants Facebook and Google, consultants Accenture and the big spending groups like Unilever and P&G which are cutting costs. Quarta told reporters there was no link between the group’s faltering performance and the sudden departure of Sorrell, and said the hunt for a new chief executive was well advanced. A leading candidate to take over the top job is Mark Read, a former board member and digital boss who has been appointed joint chief operating officer. Alongside fellow operating officer Andrew Scott, he has embarked on a review on the group and is likely to at least dispose of minority tech stakes in a bid to lower debt. “I think the business can succeed without him (Sorrell),” Read, a more media-shy exec than his former boss, said, while praising the role Sorrell had played. “People inside the company have every confidence that we can do that. We need to find a new beating heart for the group.” WPP is the world's largest ad group, competing with rivals Omnicom OMC.N, Publicis PUBP.PA and IPG IPG.N to serve clients such as Ford, Vodafone and P&G through agencies including JWT, Ogilvy and Finsbury. In a trading update, it said its key measurement of four-month net sales was marginally up, an improvement on the 0.1 percent fall in net sales in the first quarter. Liberum analysts said the improvement should give investors confidence that WPP can meet its guidance for flat sales and margins this year. Shares in WPP were down 0.8 percent. “We’ve got work to do but I don’t see why we can’t return the business to growth,” Read said. “Last year we underperformed our rivals, it is clear we need to do better.”"

The most famous advertising executive in the world, Sorrell quit the marketing giant he built from scratch in April following an allegation of personal misconduct. The 73-year-old was allowed to leave with share awards worth millions of pounds and without a non-compete clause, reigniting arguments that have dogged previous annual meetings - that WPP paid Sorrell too much and did not prepare for his departure. Neither Sorrell nor the company have revealed the nature of the complaint, but Sorrell - who has already launched a new venture - has denied any wrongdoing. WPP is the world’s largest ad group, employing more than 200,000 staff in agencies including Young & Rubicam, Ogilvy and Finsbury. Sorrell has sought to reassure WPP investors that his new venture will not compete directly with WPP. Shareholders and advisory groups have been split on whether investors should vote against the company’s remuneration report and the re-election of its chairman Roberto Quarta. David Herro, Chief Investment Officer of international equity at WPP’s biggest fund investor Harris Associates, told Reuters he backed the re-election of the board, but many of the shareholder advisory groups disagreed. “Glass Lewis has severe reservations about supporting the remuneration report at this time,” the advisory group said, adding it advised investors to vote against Quarta’s re-election. WPP is readying for a sizeable rebellion against the remuneration package, with concerns within the company that more than a quarter of investors could vote against it. WPP’s incentive plans have led to opposition in the past, with Sorrell earning around 200 million pounds ($268 million) in the last five years alone. A third of WPP’s investors refused to back his 70 million pound pay package in 2016. Sorrell’s last award scheme could potentially pay out 20 million pounds, but it is expected to come in well below that due to the recent underperformance of the group. On top of questions about Sorrell, investors are likely to want to know more about the group’s strategy after it delivered its worst annual sales performance in 2017 since the financial crisis. In April, it showed that first-quarter trading was not as bad as feared, with organic net sales down only 0.1 percent, and it will also update the market on trading on Wednesday. The group, owner of more than 400 separate agencies offering public relations, creative work, data analytics, media buying and market research, is now being run by executive chairman Quarta and joint operating officers Mark Read and Andrew Scott. The departure of Sorrell, seen as the godfather of the modern advertising industry and the major holding companies that dominate it, has led to speculation that WPP may be broken up, or may at least sell off some assets. The three executives running the business have said that does not make sense, but they will review the portfolio."

Neither Sorrell or the company have given any details of the complaint and the 73-year-old has since set up a rival ad firm. “Given the lack of confirmed information about the reasons for the former CEO’s departure, we do not believe we can assess whether his termination package is appropriate,” Hermes EOS’ Pauline Lecoursonnois said in a statement. Another WPP investor, California State Teachers’ Retirement System (CalSTRS), said it voted against Quarta’s re-election because it did not consider him independent. But in a boost to Quarta, two major shareholders, including WPP’s biggest, told Reuters they still backed him. The Hermes decision to oppose the pay report, which governs executive pay in the year just gone, sees it break ranks with the world’s biggest adviser, Institutional Shareholder Services, which last month said it would support it. The firm is preparing for a sizeable rebellion against the remuneration package, with concerns within the company that more than a quarter of investors could vote against it. Investors are targeting the pay awards after WPP agreed Sorrell could leave with his long-term incentive plan intact, meaning his share awards will vest over the next five years as company targets are met. Hermes, which advises pension schemes and other institutional investors on how to vote at corporate meetings, said it backed all other agenda items. It also supported the re-election of Quarta, who, it said, had overseen an improvement in the board’s effectiveness since taking over in 2015. Hermes said given the structural challenges facing the industry, the board needed to make the right CEO appointment and ensure all strategic options for the company were considered. “We will be asking the chair for clarity on the key criteria the new CEO needs to meet, whether a formal review of the strategic options and of the portfolio has already commenced, how much can be done before the appointment of a new CEO and how the board is involved,” Lecoursonnois said. David Herro, Chief Investment Officer of international equity at WPP’s top fund investor Harris Associates told Reuters he also backed the re-election of the board. “(We support WPP on) board re-election. I want to make sure on the rest,” Herro said in an email. Harris has a 7.5 percent WPP stake, according to Thomson Reuters data. A second top-20 investor, who wished to remain anonymous, said he also backed Quarta. “We are supportive of the chairman who has handled a very difficult situation well in circumstances neither of his making or choosing.” CalSTRS said it voted in favour of the remuneration report, saying it looked at the report “holistically”. “In other words, while there might be one action we’re not in favour of, if the report as a whole is satisfactory then we vote in favour,” it said in an e-mailed statement."

Anger over the handling of Sorrell’s departure is set to dominate WPP’s annual meeting in London on Wednesday where investors will target the one issue that caused uproar during Sorrell’s tenure - the amount he was paid. WPP’s incentive plans have led to opposition in the past, with Sorrell earning around 200 million pounds in the last five years alone. A third of WPP’s investors refused to back his 70 million pound ($94 million) pay package in 2016. Sorrell’s last award scheme could potentially pay out 20 million pounds but it is expected to come in well below that due to the recent underperformance of the group. Other shareholders are set to target the re-election of the WPP’s chairman, Roberto Quarta, after Sorrell quit the world’s biggest advertising firm following an inquiry into allegations of personal misconduct.

Most of the advertising giant’s shareholders vote ahead of time, so the company knows the results in advance, although they are not announced until the day. A spokesman for WPP could not be reached for comment. The AGM has received much media attention because of the high-profile departure of Sorrell, the architect of WPP’s success and a titan of the industry over decades. Up to 20 percent of shareholders oppose the re-election of WPP chairman Roberto Quarta to the board, Kleinman tweeted, without citing sources. He said some investors were unhappy about remuneration arrangements that Sorrell will continue to enjoy after he has left. Sorrell quit WPP after the board opened an investigation into an allegation of personal misconduct. The company has not given any details and Sorrell has denied any wrongdoing. He told staff he had stepped down because the disruption of the investigation was putting too much pressure on the business."
2.754224503905087," Exclusive: Sorrell tells investor his new venture is not targeting WPP LONDON (Reuters) - WPP’s former chief executive Martin Sorrell has moved to reassure investors in the advertising giant that the firm he has set up since his abrupt exit will not compete directly with it. Sorrell has spoken to at least two WPP shareholders in recent weeks in calls instigated by the investors and facilitated by WPP WPP.L, a spokesman for the FTSE-100 company told Reuters. In one of the calls the 73-year-old former CEO told Alastair Gunn, a fund manager at Jupiter Asset Management which is WPP’s 15th biggest shareholder, that the new venture he launched just six weeks after leaving the group in April will not undermine WPP. Sorrell, who did not have a non-compete clause in his contract and remains WPP’s eighth biggest shareholder, indicated that he would not seek to hurt the company he founded 33 years ago, Gunn told Reuters. “He’s got a lot of money still invested in WPP and he made it clear that it would be very illogical of him to be out to try and undermine his single largest investment,” Gunn said. “He said he wasn’t going to come back and do something that would be a waterfront-type competitor to WPP.” Sorrell outlined a deal to invest 40 million pounds of his own money in a reverse takeover of London-listed Derriston Capital on Wednesday. The shell company will be renamed S4 Capital and be used to buy marketing firms. The Derriston deal echoes the strategy that Sorrell used to transform shopping basket producer Wire and Plastic Products into WPP, the world’s largest advertising company with a market value of around 15.6 billion pounds. Sorrell said that he saw “significant opportunities for development in technology, data and content” and institutional investors have indicated they are willing to provide more than 150 million pounds to help S4 with acquisitions. His swift return was not a surprise, Jupiter’s Gunn said. “One of the things that made him so impressive at WPP was that he wasn’t like other CEOs, he was very driven and motivated and very accessible all the time. So the idea he was just going to sit on a beach somewhere was a bit of a joke,” Gunn added. A spokesman for Sorrell confirmed that he had spoken to WPP shareholders. Sorrell, who was one of Britain’s most high-profile and best-paid business executives, left WPP after the board investigated an allegation of personal misconduct. WPP has not given any details of the allegation and Sorrell has denied any wrongdoing."
3.8135799131259716," Proxy adviser ISS offers support to WPP Executive Chairman Roberto Quarta (Reuters) - Proxy adviser Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) has offered its support to WPP Plc’s executive chairman, Roberto Quarta, by recommending that shareholders of the world’s largest advertiser re-elect him at WPP’s annual meeting on June 13. ISS extended its support to Quarta on Wednesday. He oversaw the recent departure of industry veteran Martin Sorrell, who stepped down as chief executive on April 14 after a probe into an allegation of personal misconduct. Earlier this month, proxy adviser Glass Lewis & Co, recommended voting against Quarta at WPP’s annual meeting. ISS said it had raised concerns over the lack of transparency around Sorrell’s departure, but added that “the absence of disclosure” does not imply a failure in governance on WPP’s part. WPP’s response to allegations about Sorrell, the driving force behind 33 years of dealmaking and relentless expansion at the company, was adequate and showed that appropriate due process was observed, ISS said in an emailed statement, adding that continuity in the board’s leadership best serves the interests of the shareholders. Quarta became executive chairman after Sorrell’s departure and will hold the position until a new chief executive is found. WPP has not disclosed any details of Sorrell’s alleged misconduct and he has denied any wrongdoing. Sorrell has announced plans for a comeback after leaving WPP. On Wednesday, he said he would invest 40 million pounds ($53 million) of his own money in a little-known financial holding company Derriston Capital and use it to build a “next generation marketing services group”."
3.8135799131259716," Sorrell plots comeback with new listed company after WPP exit (Reuters) - Martin Sorrell is staging a comeback just six weeks after he was ousted from WPP WPP.L, using the same formula as in the 1980s when he transformed a little-known shell company into the world's biggest advertising group. One of Britain's best known businessmen, Sorrell said he would invest 40 million pounds ($53 million) of his own money into Derriston Capital DERR.L while institutional investors have pledged 150 million pounds to buy marketing companies. The London-listed group will be renamed S4 Capital, in reference to four generations of Sorrell’s family, while he will become executive chairman. Its next moves are likely to be closely watched in an industry facing questions over whether the ad guru’s model is still the best way to deliver adverts, marketing, research data and media buying in a digital world. WPP and its peers have struggled in recent years as major consumer goods groups such as Unilever trimmed spending on marketing and took some services in house, while consultancies such as Accenture have stepped up competition and Facebook and Google dominate the online ad market. “S4 Capital is a company that aims to build a multi-national communication services business focused on growth,” the 73-year-old said. “There are significant opportunities for development in technology, data and content.” The new company, which has raised 51 million pounds through Sorrell and institutional investors including Lombard Odier, Miton, a Rothschild investment unit, Schroders and Toscafund, is in early talks over a number of potential acquisitions. The group is looking to buy assets in the faster growing part of the industry such as technology and data which can be used to maximize the effectiveness of advertising, while markets such as India could also be of interest. Taking charge of a listed shell company repeats the tactic Sorrell used in the 1980s when he took a stake in Wire and Plastics Products, a maker of shopping baskets, and used it as a vehicle to buy some of the most famous advertising agencies such as JWT and Ogilvy & Mather. Derriston Capital is a little-known two-year-old listed shell company set up to invest in medical technology. Over 30 years Sorrell built WPP into a company with 200,000 staff in 112 countries by adding market research groups, media buyers, and public relations firms such as Finsbury. Worth 16 billion pounds, WPP returned millions to shareholders, including its CEO, and dominated the industry for decades. According to Thomson Reuters data, Sorrell is still the eighth biggest investor in WPP, with a 1.4 percent stake. Sorrell had vowed to break down the barriers at WPP to make it easier for clients to get all the services they needed from a small team, rather than from a range of people among the more than 400 agencies it owned. Starting again should make it easier to mould a business more aligned to the needs of today. WPP competes with U.S. groups Omnicom OMC.N and IPG IPG.N, France's Publicis PUBP.PA and Japan's Dentsu, while thousands of small independent companies provide everything from ads for mobile phones to creative work and data analytics. Sorrell quit WPP after the board opened an investigation into an allegation of personal misconduct. The company has not given any details and Sorrell has denied any wrongdoing. He told staff he had stepped down because the disruption was putting too much pressure on the business."

Sorrell will announce he is to become chairman of a little-known financial holding company, Derriston Capital, and use it to build a “next generation marketing services group”, the broadcaster said. Derriston, which was listed on the London Stock Exchange in 2016, did not immediately return a call for comment. Sky News, citing an unnamed source close to the transaction, said Derriston would acquire S4 Capital, an entity controlled by Sorrell, and that Sorrell would put 40 million pounds ($53 million) of his own money into the venture. Institutional investors including Lombard Odier, Miton, RIT Capital Partners, Schroders and Toscafund would add a further 11 million pounds. Sorrell, the driving force behind 33 years of dealmaking and relentless expansion at WPP, stepped down on April 14 after the board investigated an allegation of misconduct. WPP discontinued the investigation after Sorrell quit. He denied the allegations but in a letter to WPP staff published when he departed, he said the “current disruption” was “putting too much unnecessary pressure on the business”. Present in 112 countries, WPP serves clients including Ford, Unilever, P&G and a string of other major corporations around the world."

The decision -- which reinforces BP’s faith in WPP after they have worked together for two decades -- follows a competitive review process which began in the middle of last year, WPP said. Sorrell, who built WPP into the world’s biggest advertising agency through 33 years of dealmaking, quit in April after an allegation of personal misconduct. The sudden departure of Sorrell sparked questions as to whether the holding group can remain in its current form and continue to win new business at a time of changes to the landscape in the advertising industry. Under the agreement, WPP will provide services such as advertising, media investment management, digital media, marketing communication and branding services for BP, the statement said. BP has worked with WPP over the last 20 years and the British ad firm is behind the development of BP’s Helios logo -- a green, yellow and white sunburst corporate logo, replacing BP’s venerable shield.

-6.2134928195275085," WPP's first results after Sorrell boost sentiment and shares LONDON (Reuters) - The two men running WPP WPP.L following the shock exit of Martin Sorrell said they would look at restructuring the group and may sell parts of it as better than expected results provided a positive start to life without the company founder. Digital boss Mark Read and acquisitions specialist Andrew Scott used first-quarter results from the world’s biggest advertising group to outline their initial plans to counter lower customer spending and huge technological upheaval. Executive Chairman Roberto Quarta, who oversaw the departure of industry veteran Sorrell two weeks ago after an investigation into an allegation of personal misconduct, said he had asked the two executives to work on their strategy while a hunt for a new CEO continues. Analysts have speculated that WPP could sell its market research arm Kantar or even go as far as a full break up of a business built up by Sorrell over more than three decades and now valued at around 15 billion pounds ($20.6 billion). A person familiar with the matter said WPP, owner of ad agencies JWT and Ogilvy & Mather, had been contacted by one private equity group and a venture capital firm expressing interest in the Kantar business if WPP ever decides to sell. “We are facing a challenging environment,” Quarta said. “I want to reiterate that Mark and Andrew have mine and the board’s full backing to review the strategy, make recommendations to the board and then execute. “We will be keeping an open mind and will always go where value is for shareholders but the starting point is not a break up.” Quarta and his executive team were helped by the fact the quarterly sales were not as bad as feared, boosting WPP shares as much as 9 percent. Organic net sales slipped only 0.1 percent -- compared with a 1 to 1.5 percent drop that analysts had forecast. But WPP, which provides advertising, data and market research to the likes of Ford, Unilever and Vodafone through its 200,000 staff in 112 countries, is still trailing peers Omnicom OMC.N, Publicis PUBP.PA and IPG IPG.N. Read, the joint chief operating officer, said he did not underestimate the challenges ahead. “We are not complacent about what we need to do and we recognize that we need to get the top-line growing more quickly,” Read told Reuters in an interview. “There are structural shifts in the industry and we need to have more of a structural response, (but) we are an industry in structural change, not structural decline.” WPP was particularly hit by the lower spending from consumer goods groups such as Unilever and P&G, the trend of some clients to create marketing in house and by the upheaval sparked by the growth of Google and Facebook who can help clients to cut out the middle-man of the advertising groups. WPP said in March it did not expect to grow in 2018 and it reiterated that on Monday. Read said he had spoken to the group’s top 20 clients since Sorrell’s departure and had been reassured that they were not looking to ditch the British company. He said however that clients wanted a more integrated offering from WPP after years of dealing with its multiple agencies. Recent events such as a Facebook data scandal and the presence of ads next to extremist online content showed the importance of an independent advertising voice, he added. “Clients need an independent source of advice in how to navigate this new digital environment,” he said. Scott said the group would look to dispose some minority assets with funds raised going towards the faster growing parts of the business, such as data, technology and digital services. Signs that the group is moving ahead with its strategy and better-than-expected trading in China and Brazil put the shares on course for their best single gain ever and mean the stock has regained the losses it incurred when Sorrell stepped down. The 73-year-old Sorrell, who built the group from a two-man outfit in 1985 to dominate the industry, remains a hard act to follow however and Chairman Quarta faced questions over his handling of the April 14 departure from analysts. WPP did not give any details of the allegation against Sorrell who denied the charges. Quarta said on Monday that Sorrell had quit after the investigation had concluded but before the board had considered its implications. “The matter...was really what we consider to be a matter of privacy and therefore is a matter for Martin and hence the reason why we did not disclose,” he said. Analysts spoken to by Reuters said the team of Read and Scott, backed by Quarta, finance director Paul Richardson and transformation officer Lindsay Pattison, had presented a joined up strategy while the improved results will boost sentiment. Liberum media analyst Ian Whittaker said the executive team had sought to explain the restructuring already done while stating that the more bearish suggestions of industry decline were exaggerated. “There is nothing that suggests WPP is significantly behind the curve relative to other agencies,” he said.

LONDON, April 28 (Reuters) - WPP’s digital boss Mark Read will get the chance to stake his claim to the top job at the world’s biggest advertising company when he helps to present its first set of results without founder Martin Sorrell on Monday. Sorrell, who built a two-man business into one of Britain’s biggest companies with operations in 112 countries, never missed a quarterly results presentation and routinely appeared on TV and radio shows to discuss everything from advertising trends to global economic events and politics. He stood down two weeks ago after the board opened an investigation into allegations of personal misconduct, sparking a hunt for a replacement after 33 years and at a time when the company is facing challenges on every front. Sorrell denied the allegations and the company has said they will not be made public. Read is seen as the leading internal candidate to become chief executive after he spent almost nine years on the WPP board from 2006 to 2015. He has also worked on strategy, acquisitions and digital operations since he wrote to Sorrell and secured a job in 1989. On Monday, he will join his co-chief operating officer Andrew Scott, Finance Director Paul Richardson and Executive Chairman Roberto Quarta in presenting the first-quarter results, while Read will also speak to the media. “I’ve spent as much time as possible speaking to our people and clients,” Read wrote in a memo to staff last week. “There’s universal admiration for Martin’s achievements, and sadness about his departure. “At the same time, there’s a huge amount of support and goodwill for the company, and no shortage of confidence about the future.” The company will consider internal and external candidates. Whoever takes over the top job will face a difficult task, however, after the group published in March its weakest results since the financial crash due to lower spending from consumer goods groups like Unilever and P&G and competition from Google and Facebook. It forecast no growth in net sales in 2018 and analysts are expecting a first-quarter figure of down 1 percent or worse. “Despite the change of CEO, other things are unlikely to change at WPP near term,” Morgan Stanley said in a note. “We expect WPP to stay with its guidance which is for organic flat net sales growth in 2018 and a flat underlying margin in constant currency.” The sudden departure of Sorrell has also sparked speculation as to whether the holding group can remain in its current form of employing 200,000 people in more than 400 agencies now that clients want a more joined-up offering. Read told colleagues he did not believe breaking the business up made sense. “In a world where clients need faster, more agile, integrated solutions, we need to get closer together, not further apart,” he said.

On Monday, he will join his co-chief operating officer Andrew Scott, Finance Director Paul Richardson and Executive Chairman Roberto Quarta in presenting the first-quarter results, while Read will also speak to the media. “I’ve spent as much time as possible speaking to our people and clients,” Read wrote in a memo to staff last week. “There’s universal admiration for Martin’s achievements, and sadness about his departure. “At the same time, there’s a huge amount of support and goodwill for the company, and no shortage of confidence about the future.” The company will consider internal and external candidates. Whoever takes over the top job will face a difficult task, however, after the group published in March its weakest results since the financial crash due to lower spending from consumer goods groups like Unilever and P&G and competition from Google and Facebook. It forecast no growth in net sales in 2018 and analysts are expecting a first-quarter figure of down 1 percent or worse. “Despite the change of CEO, other things are unlikely to change at WPP near term,” Morgan Stanley said in a note. “We expect WPP to stay with its guidance which is for organic flat net sales growth in 2018 and a flat underlying margin in constant currency.” The sudden departure of Sorrell has also sparked speculation as to whether the holding group can remain in its current form of employing 200,000 people in more than 400 agencies now that clients want a more joined-up offering. Read told colleagues he did not believe breaking the business up made sense. “In a world where clients need faster, more agile, integrated solutions, we need to get closer together, not further apart,” he said. WPP is the last of the big four advertising agencies to update the market after Omnicom OMC.N, Publicis PUBP.PA and IPG IPG.N all reported strong first-quarter results."

-2.153219467466959," Ford tells WPP it will take bids from other ad agencies LONDON (Reuters) - Ford Motor Company F.N said on Saturday it will take bids on some of its advertising managed by WPP WPP.L, adding to uncertainty around the British ad giant after last week's exit of founder Martin Sorrell. While Ford’s decision does not affect all of its accounts with WPP - and the agency will be able to bid for the rest of the business along with everyone else - it comes at a difficult juncture for the world’s biggest advertising firm. Sorrell, who over 33 years built the firm into one of Britain’s biggest companies, quit last week as chief executive officer after an allegation of personal misconduct that he denies. Saturday’s announcement is part of a review of Ford’s strategy that has lasted since November, when it told long-time partner WPP that it was considering its future ad model. “We are going to place some portions of our advertising business up for bid with other agencies, including WPP, beginning in the coming weeks. No decisions have been made,” Ford Britain said in a statement. It added that WPP is a trusted partner of Ford and that it had offered the agency more detail about its marketing aspirations. WPP, which counts Ford as a major client, declined to comment. WPP staff were sent a memo on Friday outlining Ford’s decision. “WPP will have an opportunity to compete with other firms to retain these portions of the business, and will remain Ford’s agency of record in some other key areas,” a copy of the memo seen by Reuters said. Ford’s review of its ad operations does not include accounts with WPP in China, public affairs, U.S. dealerships or WPP’s Hudson Rouge agency that handles Ford’s luxury Lincoln brand, the memo said. WPP and its major rivals Omnicom OMC.N, Publicis PUBP.PA and IPG IPG.N face challenges on every front, from the might of Google and Facebook - whom Sorrell famously dubbed ""frenemies"" - to the rapidly encroaching consultants Accenture and Deloitte. With clients demanding ever-lower fees, big advertising groups are grappling to become more nimble and efficient to protect their revenues and avoid pressure on them to break up."
-2.153219467466959," End of Sorrell's reign heralds change for big ad empires LONDON (Reuters) - Martin Sorrell’s departure from the world’s biggest advertising company heralds change for his sprawling WPP empire and may accelerate a shake up of the big ad groups that followed his lead. WPP and its major rivals Omnicom, Publicis and IPG face challenges on every front, from the might of Google and Facebook - whom Sorrell famously dubbed “frenemies” - to the rapidly encroaching consultants Accenture and Deloitte. With clients demanding ever-lower fees, big advertising groups must learn to be more nimble and efficient to protect their revenues and avoid pressure on them to break up. “I don’t think this is the event that brings down the holding companies,” industry adviser and MediaLink Chief Executive Michael Kassan told Reuters. “I do believe this is going to force everybody to rethink.” Ad groups embark on their latest transformation without Sorrell, the godfather of the modern industry who quit after 33 years over an investigation into misconduct. WPP does not plan to release results of the probe. He denies the allegations. The clear industry leader WPP employs 200,000 staff who offer advertising, branding, media buying, lobbying and data analytics via more than 400 separate companies. Sorrell built up the group since the 1980s. When he set out, elaborate television campaigns ruled. Complexity was added as the ad market moved online and become more fragmented. The structure he began with, now looks dated. Several years of strong organic growth at WPP evaporated in 2017. In March, it said it did not expect to grow in 2018. WPP’s stock has fallen by a third in a year. FIS Astec Analytics, a data provider, says 51 million of WPP’s shares are on loan to short sellers, up from just 1 million a year ago. WPP valuation has slid to 9.9 times future earnings, compared with a FTSE average of 13.6 times, while its big three rivals still boast multiples of 12 to 14 times. Sorrell’s resignation further dented WPP’s share price but the firm’s executives still say they are upbeat. “I think some people might feel a bit liberated,” Stephen Allan, who runs WPP’s media-buying agency MediaCom, told BBC radio. WPP, the owner of agencies JWT and Ogilvy & Mather, has been hit hard by a reduction in spending from the world’s biggest consumer goods groups, Unilever and Procter & Gamble, which complain about having to deal with WPP’s multiple agencies. They also want more transparency in how ads are viewed, after an Association of National Advertisers report showed some ads were only seen by bots and many were not watched at all. P&G Chief Brand Officer Marc Pritchard said the media supply chain was “murky at best and fraudulent at worst”, adding it was time to end the era of “Mad Men”, referring to ad leaders in the 1960s credited with laying the foundations for the industry that Sorrell built on. Digital consultant Ian Maude said advertising agencies needed to provide creative services and strategies for planning and buying media space, all reinforced by data insight, public relations and input on how a user shops and acts online. “The question is whether the holding companies are the right structure any more and whether they can be turned into something that is nimble and agile in a reasonable timetable that is going to satisfy investors,” he said. Sorrell said in March WPP would accelerate plans to break down barriers between agencies to create a cohesive global team. That is not easy when many of them are run as individual entities competing with rivals inside and outside WPP. “WPP probably still has the best portfolio of assets,” said Brian Wieser at Pivotal Research. “It’s direction wasn’t wrong. The problem was one of execution and articulation.” One group that is earning plaudits, however, is Publicis. Tech groups, independent agencies and consultants have told Reuters the French group has a more joined up offering. Run for decades by Sorrell’s rival Maurice Levy, Publicis set out plans in March under its new boss Arthur Sadoun to foster more collaboration between its agencies and to become a consulting and technology partner to global advertisers. Publicis on Thursday reported better-than-expected sales growth in the first quarter of this year. Omnicom, the biggest holding company in the United States, is also drawing together single teams from across its agencies to support individual clients. IPG, the fourth of the big four, has said it expects a stronger 2018 after a slow 2017. “TIPPING POINT” Michael Farmer, author of the book Madison Avenue Manslaughter, says the holding companies need to stop accepting demands to produce more work for lower fees. He also said they need to compete more effectively for talent against firms such as Accenture. “The tipping point has been reached,” said Farmer, who works with advertising agencies and major brands such as Ford and Kraft on strategy. “WPP is not growing.” Mark Read, WPP’s co-Chief Operating Officer since Sorrell’s departure last weekend, told staff WPP needed to hold together. “There’s been speculation about breaking up the group. We don’t believe this makes sense,” he wrote in an email that was the first in the group’s history to go directly to all WPP staff worldwide. “We need to get closer together, not further apart.” To improve their offering, the ad groups could start by being more transparent. Michael Moszynski, previously of Saatchi who now runs the agency London Advertising, said clients wanted to see more clearly how their money was spent. And some clients remain loyal. A marketing chief at one major packaged goods company, who asked not to be named, told Reuters that WPP provided a powerful service, wrapping data analytics and insight with its creative work that helped clients navigate changing markets. WPP must now make that kind of joined up offering the norm if it is to avoid unraveling. But it will have to do this without Sorrell at the helm, which may prove tough. “It’s the fall of an emperor,” David Jones, the former CEO of WPP peer Havas, told Reuters. “One that I think will not only take the empire down with him but will also have massive ramifications for that entire industry.”"
-2.153219467466959," WPP says no follow-up requests from UK watchdog over CEO investigation LONDON (Reuters) - WPP has had no further requests for information from Britain’s financial watchdog after answering initial questions about the firm’s investigation into Martin Sorrell, its recently departed chief executive, a company spokesman said. WPP, the world’s biggest advertising group, released a statement on April 3 to confirm a report in the Wall Street Journal that it was investigating an allegation of personal misconduct against Sorrell, its founder and CEO for 32 years. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) then wrote to WPP to ask if there was any more information it could share at that time. Sorrell denied the allegation, but quit 11 days later, saying the disruption was putting too much pressure on the business. “We had a call from them (the FCA) after the Wall Street Journal article and our first announcement to ask if we could share any further details,” a WPP spokesman said. “We advised that we had satisfied all of our disclosure obligations and there was no additional information we needed to share. They were aware that we were ensuring we were discussing obligations with our legal advisers. They have not made any additional requests.” The FCA says it is the responsibility of listed companies to ensure they identify potential inside information and take steps to disclose it appropriately to the market. “The FCA routinely contacts firms or their advisers to clarify press commentary, announcements and events and did so in this case,” a spokesman said. Shares in WPP initially rose in the days after the first statement before they fell 7 percent on the Monday after Sorrell’s resignation."

Asked during an analyst call if Publicis might eye any WPP assets should they be sold off, Publicis Chief Executive Arthur Sadoun replied: “We are not speculating at all about what is happening at WPP.” Sadoun also reiterated that Publicis would keep a “disciplined” approach regarding its mergers and acquisitions strategy, which would focus on areas such as data and digital."

3.3799198804505166," Britain's WPP, investors adjust to life without Sorrell LONDON (Reuters) - WPP WPP.L entered uncharted territory on Monday after the exit of founder Martin Sorrell left the world's biggest advertising company rudderless at a time of intense industry change. Shares in WPP fell 6 percent after Sorrell, the driving force behind 33 years of dealmaking and relentless expansion, stepped down on Saturday after the board investigated an allegation of misconduct. David Herro of Harris Associates, WPP’s biggest shareholder according to Thomson Reuters data, said Sorrell would be missed. “Sir Martin is a visionary, a legend in advertising and a skilful businessman,” he said. “The circumstances surrounding this are regrettable as is a leadership transition without Sir Martin’s involvement. The sudden departure of Sorrell, the face of the company which he founded in 1985, has sparked questions as to whether the holding group can remain in its current form of employing 200,000 people in more than 400 agencies across 112 countries. It has also prompted fears that without Sorrell’s contacts it could lose clients and talent while it seeks a new CEO. “We think the lack of operational direction for the group and potential for client losses are clear downside risks over the short to medium term,” Deutsche Bank said. “The potential for asset sales or even a break-up may provide some support, but these are highly uncertain and unlikely to take place in the near-term.” WPP said that chairman Roberto Quarta will become executive chairman while its digital boss Mark Read and Andrew Scott, the chief operating officer of WPP Europe who oversaw acquisitions, become joint chief operating officers. They inherit a difficult task, with WPP in March publishing its weakest results since the financial crisis as consumer goods groups such as Unilever and P&G cut spending and other customers jumped ship. The industry is also battling the might of Google and Facebook, which dominate the online advertising market, and watching nervously as consultants such as Accenture move more aggressively into the sector. The changing dynamics have meant the previous idea of building marketing groups up to offer advertising, branding, planning and research on a global scale - championed by Sorrell and followed by others - is now under threat as clients want more nimble relationships in a digital age. Many are starting to ask if they can do things differently - creating their own content to place directly on online platforms or working with smaller ad groups. Analysts are already saying that WPP’s market research arm Kantar could be sold off for around 3.5 billion pounds ($5 billion), compared with the group’s overall market value of 14.5 billion pounds, and question whether there are synergies from holding PR assets like Finsbury. Sorrell had argued that the insight provided from market research had set WPP apart from peers such as Omnicom OMC.N, Publicis PUBP.PA and IPG IPG.N, enabling it to improve its decision making when planning and buying media space for ads. The group also owns stakes in groups such as Chime Communications, Vice, AppNexus and Chime Communications which could be reviewed. With so much change in the industry, some analysts have questioned whether the group should seek a new CEO from outside who could look at it dispassionately. Names already in the frame include Jerry Buhlmann, who runs the Dentsu Aegis network, and Adam Crozier who previously ran broadcaster ITV and Royal Mail. Jeremy Darroch, the well regarded CEO of bid target Sky, and Andrew Robertson, boss of rival ad agency BBDO, have also been linked with the job. From inside WPP Read, 51, is seen as the lead candidate. While a common refrain heard about WPP is that no one knows the company like Sorrell, Read is the one man who comes close after he wrote to the WPP boss asking for a job in 1989. From the company’s office in Farm Street, Mayfair, he watched as Sorrell pulled off a string of takeovers before building his own profile by growing its digital operations. He spent nearly 10 years on the WPP board, introducing him to investors, and is regarded by peers as a strategic thinker who can win corporate pitches to bring in work. Scott, 49, is better known in the corporate world than the advertising community, having worked on the company’s acquisition strategy. “Mark will be responsible for clients, operating companies and people,” a spokesman said. “Andrew will focus on financial and operational performance and implementing on-going reorganization of the group’s portfolio.” They will “report to and be supported” by Quarta. Read has already contacted senior executives within WPP to offer to speak to clients and reassure them that work will continue as normal. Whoever replaces Sorrell however will face longer-term questions as to whether a group that was built in his mould should remain intact after his departure. Already executives are predicting that bits will be sold off in a move that could once again become a model for the wider industry. David Jones, the former CEO of WPP peer Havas and the founder of tech marketing group You and Mr Jones, predicted WPP would eventually end up missing Sorrell more than he would WPP. “No one else can keep that company together the way he has been able to because he built it,” he told Reuters. “It’s the fall of an emperor and one that I think will not only take the empire down with him but will also have massive ramifications for that entire industry.” Sorrell, 73, did not have a non-compete clause and could set up a new advertising business. He owns 1.4 percent of WPP, according to Thomson Reuters data."

WPP said in early April it had appointed lawyers to investigate a whistleblower’s allegation of personal misconduct against Sorrell, who over 33 years turned a two-man outfit into one of Britain’s biggest companies present in 112 countries. The 73-year-old said on Saturday he was standing down, departing at a crucial time for WPP which has seen its share price fall 30 percent this year due to lower client spending, contract losses and a growing threat from Google and Facebook. “I shall miss all of you greatly,” he wrote in an email to staff. “As a founder, I can say that WPP is not just a matter of life or death, it was, is and will be more important than that.” WPP did not give any details of the allegation and Sorrell denied the charges, initially saying that he understood the need to investigate. However, when the matter made it into the Wall Street Journal he told friends he thought it was being used as a weapon to force him out, one source said. A former rival chief executive and a current CEO told Reuters last week that the fact Sorrell was under investigation showed how the dynamic within WPP had changed. “To me it’s not actually about whether he did anything wrong but it’s the fact that three years ago the board would not even have gone down this path,” the former CEO said. “Martin was all powerful and WPP without Martin was not worth thinking about.” The son of an electronics retailer who was educated at the University of Cambridge, Sorrell made his name as the finance director of the start-up British ad agency Saatchi & Saatchi. He took centre stage in 1985, buying a stake in a small manufacturing firm Wire and Plastic Products Plc to use it as a public vehicle to buy communications groups around the world. Within a few years he had sealed a string of takeovers, snapping up such storied creative agencies as J. Walter Thompson and Ogilvy before moving into the cash cow of media planning and buying by creating Group M. Market-research firms and public relations groups such as Finsbury followed. Known for a ferocious work ethic and microscopic attention to detail, Sorrell built up the group by pitching aggressively for work, often leading the charge himself and going above the heads of marketing officers to deal directly with their bosses. The role meant Sorrell became an authority not just on advertising but on the global economy and an ever present voice on the media and at events such as Davos. Respected by his peers, he was however shown little affection by them in the ego-driven ad business and was sometimes dismissed as a “beancounter” because of his financial rather than advertising background. David Ogilvy famously referred to Sorrell as an “odious little jerk” when the WPP CEO sought to buy his company. The two ad men later made up and Sorrell signed off WPP’s annual report that year as “OLJ”. “He is so brutally competitive,” the former CEO said. “He is such a competitor and he can get so angry when he loses.” Many executives recount stories of the CEO taking contract losses personally, including one who told Reuters how Sorrell had shared an hour’s car journey in complete silence after his rival mentioned an account he had recently won from WPP. Sorrell sparred repeatedly with the long-time boss of French rival Publicis, Maurice Levy, and enjoyed pointing out to journalists the failings of his rivals. His combative style earned respect from the senior staff who worked for him however. One New York-based executive told Reuters how, on a night out, senior executives would all email Sorrell at exactly the same time to see who he would respond to first. “He has an astounding grasp of detail if you consider the scale of the enterprise,” said another executive who knew Sorrell professionally for many decades. “It’s practically a stage show.” The success also brought great wealth for the father of four, with the perma-tanned executive earning around 200 million pounds in the last five years alone due to a performance-linked bonus scheme that angered many shareholders. CEOs and executives, who asked not to be named, lamented that Sorrell would not get the chance to reposition WPP, which in March posted its weakest results since the financial crash. Whoever takes over will have to decide whether the group of 200,000 people should remain in its current form. Having run the agencies as separate companies for years to stimulate competition, WPP had started to break down the barriers to appease clients who found it unwieldy and unsuited to the digital age where clients could create their own content and place it directly on Google and Facebook. Brian Wieser, advertising analyst at Pivotal Research, said WPP had the right assets but it had not packaged them properly in recent years and the fact it was more fragmented than Omnicom and Publicis meant it was now harder to reposition. The initial task will fall to Chairman Roberto Quarta, who described Sorrell as the “driving force” behind WPP, and executives Mark Read and Andrew Scott who will be joint chief operating officers while the company seeks a new CEO. Sorrell told staff that WPP had come through difficult times before and would do so again, saying he would be available to anyone who wanted advice. “For the past 33 years, I have spent every single day thinking about the future of WPP,” he said. “Good fortune and Godspeed to all of you. Now, Back to the Future.” ( Editing by Alexander Smith)"
