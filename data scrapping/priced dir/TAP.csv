35.81867688096263," Coca-Cola to enter U.S. alcoholic drinks market with Molson Coors tie-up (Reuters) - There will be more than just fizz when Coca-Cola Co KO.N launches the alcoholic version of its Topo Chico sparkling water along with beer giant Molson Coors Beverage Co TAP.N in the United States. It will be the beverage giant's first alcoholic drink in the country. The launch, planned for next year, will help Coca-Cola push further into alcoholic drinks and expand its market beyond Latin America and Japan, where it sells Lemon-Do drink. Coca-Cola bought the Topo Chico brand in 2017 from its second-largest bottling partner in Latin America, Arca Continental. For Molson Coors, the launch is expected to strengthen its portfolio of low-alcohol spirits, including hard seltzers, which have seen surging demand. Molson Coors said on Tuesday that it would roll out Topo Chico in the first half of 2021, its third hard seltzer to hit the shelves. The low calorie drink will compete with the popular White Claw beverage as well as other hard seltzers from companies, including Anheuser Busch Inbev NV ABI.BR. Molson Coors said last month that it tied up with D.G. Yuengling & Son Inc to brew and sell Yuengling beers in the West Coast in efforts to boost its business. Molson Coors shares were up about 4% in early trading."

Yuengling & Son Inc to brew and sell the family-owned company's beers outside of the East Coast, while expanding its presence in premium brews. The 50-50 partnership will see Pennsylvania-based Yuengling expand its presence into 25 other U.S. states, mainly on the West Coast, by using its much larger and established peer Molson Coors’ manufacturing capabilities. Terms of the transaction were not disclosed. “This is a huge growth opportunity for us ..there are 25 markets where it is not being sold at all and there is a huge upside,” said Gavin Hattersley, CEO of Molson Coors, which makes Miller Lite and Miller Coors beers. “There is pent up demand for this brand (in the West).” Hattersley said the JV would need some startup capital from both sides, but the deal would not materially make a difference to Molson’s own capital budget. There would also be no threat to Yuengling’s sales eating into Molson’s own brand market share, as it competes in the premium category where Molson has a smaller presence, he said. Yuengling Chief Administration Officer Wendy Yuengling said the higher costs of shipping to the West Coast from its two breweries in Pennsylvania and one in Florida had limited its abilities to expand earlier. For Molson, the move is part of new CEO Hattersley’s plan to reinvent its business that has struggled as consumers migrate towards hard seltzer, low-alcohol spirits and more premium beers. Just a month after he became CEO on Sept. 28, 2019, Hattersley announced Molson Coors would drop ""Brewing Co"" from the company name to reflect its new strategy that would include venturing into brewed tea and coffee along with beer.

-0.08146347643424148," Molson Coors suspends quarterly dividend, furloughs employees (Reuters) - Molson Coors Beverage TAP.N said on Friday it had suspended quarterly dividends for fiscal 2020 and furloughed some employees in Europe and North America, as the Miller Lite beer maker looks to save cash amid the coronavirus crisis. Liquor companies are among the worst-hit from the fallout of the pandemic, as pubs and restaurants remain closed or are operating in limited capacity across the globe to curb the spread of the virus. Molson Coors will also cut capital expenditure by about $200 million, reduce marketing expenses and limit the number of new hires, while also evaluating various European government liquidity programs. The U.S.-listed shares of the Coors Light beer maker slipped after the bell, having shed about one-third of their value so far this year. Molson Coors Canada TPXb.TO also suspended its regular quarterly dividends for fiscal 2020."
-19.621769271610244," Gunman kills five co-workers and himself in Molson Coors brewery shooting in Milwaukee Milwaukee (Reuters) - A gunman opened fire at the Molson Coors Beverage Co brewing complex in Milwaukee on Wednesday, killing five co-workers before he was found dead from an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound, the city’s police chief said. No one else was injured in the violence at the sprawling campus of more than 20 buildings, where some 1,400 workers are employed by the beer company in Wisconsin’s largest city, Milwaukee Police Chief Alfonso Morales said. The entire Molson Coors property was placed under a security lockdown for several hours following the gunfire as police swept each building to rule out any further threats or victims. “We can now say that the scene is secure. All employees who were on scene have been allowed to go home,” Morales told reporters at a late-night news conference several hours after the afternoon shooting. Morales said the bloodshed was confined to the Molson Coors TAP.N complex west of downtown - a facility known to locals as the old Miller brewery - and that ""no members of the general public were involved."" Miller beer is one of the company’s leading brands, and Mayor Tom Barrett said the plant has been part of the city for 165 years. Morales said the body of the dead gunman, who was believed to have acted alone, was found in the same building as his five victims. The suspect was described by police as a 51-year-old Milwaukee resident and employee of Molson Coors. Details about the circumstances of the shooting, including what may have precipitated the carnage, were not provided by authorities. “We are a family here at Molson Coors in Milwaukee, and this is an unthinkable tragedy for us,” company President and Chief Executive Officer Gavin Hattersley told reporters. President Donald Trump, acknowledging the shooting hours earlier as he opened a White House news conference about the coronavirus outbreak, referred to the gunman as a “wicked murderer” and called the gun violence “a terrible thing.” “Our hearts go out to the people of Wisconsin and to the families,” he said. At a news conference earlier in the evening, the mayor branded the shooting “an unspeakable tragedy.” “There were five individuals who went to work today just like everybody goes to work. They thought they were going to work and return to their families. They didn’t, and tragically they never will.” In the immediate aftermath of the bloodshed, the company advised employees in an email that the gunman had been located in or near a second-floor stairwell near a packaging facility, The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. Hours later at Spitfires on State, a tavern a few blocks from the shooting scene, patrons made solemn toasts to Miller, an iconic Milwaukee brand. A small group of employees, still wearing their protective gear from their shift earlier in the day at the brewery, huddled together inside the bar. “Prayers and condolences,” one female employee said as she left the bar after hugging two co-workers. The Milwaukee shooting seemed likely to reignite a contentious debate about gun control in the midst of the U.S. presidential election. The campaign of Democratic candidate Michael Bloomberg, the former New York City mayor, was set to host a roundtable discussion about gun violence at an event in Los Angeles on Thursday. A campaign spokeswoman said the event, which Bloomberg was not planning to attend, was previously scheduled, but added, “recent events will likely be discussed.” Last year saw 417 mass shootings in the United States, according to the Gun Violence Archive, the highest annual number since the nonprofit research group started keeping a tally in 2013. GVA defines a mass shooting as any in which at least four people, excluding the perpetrator, are shot."
7.357201945610709," Molson Coors to cut jobs, invest beyond beers in restructuring plan (Reuters) - Molson Coors Brewing Co TAP.N said on Wednesday it would cut jobs, simplify business segments and add more products beyond beers as the new Chief Executive Officer Gavin Hattersley looks to boost revenue. The company, which had about 17,750 employees at the end of 2018, plans to save about $150 million in cost and expects to cut 400-500 jobs in its U.S., Canada and international segments. This is part of its plan to bring down its business units to one each in North America and Europe from four globally. It will also shut its Denver office and make Chicago its North American operational base. The brewer said it would incur charges between $120 million and $180 million, which will be spread out through the rest of the financial year and until fiscal 2021. “Organizational changes, further cost-cutting are appropriate, though the magnitude of cost saves is likely to underwhelm,” Jefferies analyst Kevin Grundy said. Shares of the company, which missed Wall Street estimates for quarterly revenue and profit, fell as much as 5%. Molson Coors has posted sales decline in six of the last seven quarters. The shift to other products comes at a time when demand for traditional beer has been slowing globally. Last week, the world's largest brewer Anheuser-Busch InBev ABI.BR lowered its annual profit growth forecast as drinkers in Brazil and South Korea turned away from its beers. Earlier this year, Molson launched a canned wine and a hard coffee line and said on Wednesday that it aims to ramp up investment in “above-premium” beers, a fast-growing category, that includes craft beers. As it broadens product line, the maker of Coors Light and Miller Lite said starting 2020 it would be known as Molson Coors Beverage Co. Rivals Corona maker Constellation Brands STZ.N and Boston Beer SAM.N also have also expanded into hard seltzers and craft beers. “Our business is at an inflection point. We can continue down the path we’ve been on for several years now, or we can make the significant and difficult changes necessary to get back on the right track,” Hattersley, who was U.S. unit head till September, said."

Under, Hunter, 56, the company bought out SABMiller’s $12 billion stake in MillerCoors in 2016, which helped it grow sales in the United States. But weakness in beer sales in the United States due to increased competition and growing demand for craft beers has weighed on the company’s performance and its stock. Its second-quarter sales fell 4.4% to $2.95 billion, well below Wall Street estimates, sending its shares down 8%. Before becoming CEO in 2015, Hunter held several top positions and played a key role in the acquisition of the Carling business in the UK in 2002. Hattersley, 56, has been heading the U.S. unit since 2015 and was Molson’s chief financial officer for three years before taking the role."

-1.5756444250399646," Molson Coors' shares fall on accounting errors, lower sales (Reuters) - Molson Coors Brewing Co on Tuesday reported lower-than-expected quarterly sales and said it would restate its financial statements for fiscal 2016 and 2017, after the company’s audit committee found some errors in financial reporting. Shares of the company, which had risen 16.4 percent this year, fell 7.8 percent in premarket trading. The accounting errors originated from its acquisition of remaining 58 percent stake in MillerCoors LLC in 2016, the company said in a filing with regulators, adding that its impact will not be material. After restating, the financial results for fiscal 2016 will reflect an increase in Molson Coors’ deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax expenses by $399.1 million, which will pull down its net income and earnings per share. For fiscal 2017, the restatements will reflect a reduction to deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax expense of $151.4 million, and a corresponding increase in net income and earnings per share. Separately, the beer maker reported a 6.2 percent drop in fourth-quarter sales to $2.42 billion, missing analysts’ estimate of $2.54 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The company’s sales were hurt by low volumes in the United States and Canada, partially offseting gains from Europe and other overseas markets. U.S. brand volumes fell 5.1 percent during the quarter, hit by lower volumes in its premium light segment that includes brands such as Miller Lite and Coors Light. Excluding items, the company earned 84 cents per share, beating Wall Street estimate of 79 cents per share."

-4.235339765432322," UPDATE 1-Molson Coors to make cannabis-based drinks in Canada (Adds industry details) Aug 1 (Reuters) - Molson Coors Brewing Co’s Canadian arm will make cannabis-infused drinks along with marijuana producer Hydropothecary Corp, betting on a promising market as beer sales stagnate in North America. The brewer is the latest to capitalize on Canada’s decision to legalize recreational marijuana later in the year, a market industry watchers say could be worth $5 billion to $10 billion. Last year, Corona beer-maker Constellation Brands Inc became the first major beer and spirits producer to partner with a Canadian marijuana producer, picking up a nearly 10 percent stake in Canopy Growth Corp. Molson Coors Canada said its joint venture with Hydropothecary, which will make non-alcoholic pot-based drinks, will be a standalone company with its own board of directors and an independent management team. The deal is expected to close before Sept. 30, just ahead of the proposed legalization of recreational marijuana in Canada. Marijuana products like toffees and drinks are expected to be legalized by 2019. The Canadian brewer will have a 57.5 percent controlling interest in the venture, with Hydropothecary owning the rest. Molson Coors, the No. 2 beer maker in North America, has seen global beer volumes fall in the latest quarter. In the United States, volumes dropped 4.8 percent as consumers shift to craft beers and wine. “There is a paradigm shift underway and cannabis has the potential to provide answers to the alcoholic drinks industry’s existential questions,” said Spiros Malandrakis, head of alcoholic drinks at Euromonitor.

-12.615521662692847," Molson Coors steps up climate fight, even as heat drives thirst OSLO (Reuters) - Molson Coors is stepping up efforts to fight global warming even though recent hot weather in Europe during the World Cup has lifted beer sales for one of the world’s biggest brewers, Chief Executive Mark Hunter said on Wednesday. The firm cut carbon emissions from its direct operations by 15 percent in 2017, he told Reuters, the first year of a program aimed at halving emissions by 2025 as part of a goal of limiting droughts, floods and more powerful storms. Molson Coors is also working to cut use of water and energy and aims for zero waste to landfills by 2025, he said of the firm’s “raising the bar on beer” project to protect the environment with sustainable growth. “It reduces our energy use pretty significantly, it reduces our water costs significantly. It really is win-win” for profitability and the environment, he said by telephone from Denver. Hunter said long-term disruptions to water supplies from climate change were a threat to crops including barley and hops, vital for beer. Even so, hot weather has a flip side by making people thirstier. “The last 6-8 weeks in Europe have been very helpful,” Hunter said of scorching temperatures in many nations. “A World Cup is certainly helpful, but probably not as helpful as good, stable warm weather,” he said. England and Croatia play a World Cup semi-final later on Wednesday, seeking to meet France in the final. Molson Coors produces Carling in England and Ozujsko in Croatia. He said the British brewery was self-sufficient in carbon dioxide, which puts the fizz in beer, despite shortages elsewhere in the country. He said Molson Coors was joining a U.N.-backed initiative by about 430 companies worldwide to set “science-based” targets, meant to match the overall goals of the Paris climate agreement, adopted in 2015 by 195 nations. U.S. President Donald Trump plans to pull out of the Paris pact, doubting mainstream findings about the risks of warming. By contrast, Molson Coors plans to halve emissions within its own operations by 2025, from 2016 levels, and by 20 percent across its entire business. The firm produces beers including Coors Light, Blue Moon and Miller Lite. Among other global big brewers setting science-based goals, Anheuser-Busch InBev plans to cut emissions by 25 percent per drink by 2025 from 2017 levels. Carlsberg aims for zero greenhouse gas emissions from its breweries by 2030. Hunter said the firm has stuck to earnings guidance for 2018 despite weaker-than-expected earnings in the first quarter, hit by low U.S. demand. Among 2018 goals, the company expects an underlying free cash flow of $1.5 billion. The firm is offering incentives to farmers to improve the use of water. The company now uses 3.57 units of water to produce a unit of beer at its main breweries and wants to cut the ratio to 2.8 by 2025. Molson Coors is also reviewing the idea of marijuana-infused beer after Canada approved sales starting in October. “There is a lot to consider around this, particularly from a responsibility perspective,” Hunter said."
