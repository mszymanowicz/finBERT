-10.939148786493138," AerCap cancels 15 MAX jets, urges Airbus and Boeing output cuts DUBLIN/PARIS (Reuters) - Leasing giant AerCap AER.N said on Wednesday it had cancelled 15 orders for the grounded Boeing BA.N 737 MAX aircraft as it slows the pace of new plane deliveries to weather the coronavirus crisis. Announcing the cancellations - which leave 80 of the MAX jets still on its order books - the world's largest aircraft owner also called for more production cuts by Boeing and rival Airbus AIR.PA to help balance the jet market. AerCap, which has deferred dozens more MAX deliveries, said it remains uncertain when the five MAX planes already on lease will return to service, as regulators review changes to the jet after two fatal crashes. U.S. authorities said last week they expect to give a green light in the “near future”. As a result, AerCap reached agreement with Boeing this month to restructure its order book, it said on Wednesday. AerCap boss Aengus Kelly called for a further aircraft manufacturing slowdown as he reported a drop in second-quarter net income to $246 million from $331 million a year earlier, amid a global travel slump unleashed by the pandemic. “I think we’ll see more production cuts both from Boeing and Airbus, to help us get to that equilibrium,” he said during an earnings call with analysts. “I would be hopeful that tomorrow when Airbus release their results we’ll see another production cut there,” the AerCap CEO said. Airbus declined to comment ahead of its own results announcement on Thursday. Leasing firms are traditionally conservative about production to preserve the value of their fleets, but the call from the world’s largest lessor puts pressure on Airbus to defend output levels that some analysts consider too high. AerCap said it was well placed to weather the coronavirus crisis thanks to its $27 billion in unencumbered assets and record-high liquidity including $3 billion in new funding. “We have begun leasing airplanes again, but it’s almost exclusively focused on the European market,” Kelly said, adding that earlier signs of a U.S. travel rebound had since “run out of steam” amid new virus outbreaks and lockdowns. Despite European reversals such as renewed British quarantine measures for Spanish arrivals, a recovery is now “well underway” in the region, Kelly said. “No doubt there will be setbacks, but the willingness and the desire of the consumer to travel is very clear.”"
-3.6310140660778556," Aircraft lessor AerCap pushes back deliveries of 37 aircraft (Reuters) - Aircraft leasing giant AerCap Holdings on Tuesday pushed back deliveries of 37 aircraft to 2023 and beyond as it looks to boost liquidity and lower capital spending. The world’s largest aircraft leasing company, which had previously forecast the deliveries to be between 2021 and 2022, said the rescheduling would help reduce its cash capital expenditures in 2020 and 2021 by a total of about $4.7 billion. “We expect our cash capital expenditures during these years to decrease further as we continue our discussions with the aircraft manufacturers and our customers. All of the aircraft delivering in 2020 and 2021 have already been placed on long-term leases,” the company said. The aviation industry is enduring its worst crisis after the coronavirus pandemic crippled most flights, piling pressure on a sector already weakened by the grounding of Boeing Co’s MAX jets. Earlier this month, the company had warned that it was facing cancellations of 737 MAX leases by some of its own airline customers and reserved the right to reject taking delivery of affected aircraft from Boeing."
9.419767191977071," Aircraft lessor AerCap boosts liquidity, defers jet deliveries (Reuters) - Aircraft leasing giant AerCap AER.N said it had boosted liquidity and reduced capital spending for 2020 by postponing jet deliveries, while withdrawing its full-year outlook as the coronavirus crisis batters aviation. Shares in the world’s largest aircraft leasing company jumped more than 12% after it announced it had $11 billion in liquidity to help ride out the industry’s worst-ever crisis. Chief Executive Aengus Kelly said AerCap had obtained the deferral of deliveries of dozens of grounded 737 MAX from Boeing BA.N ""on competitive terms"". However, AerCap joined other aviation finance firms in raising questions over orders for the jet following a 14-month-old safety ban and a recent halt in production. AerCap said it was facing cancellations of 737 MAX leases by some of its own airline customers, and reserved the right to reject taking delivery of affected aircraft from Boeing. “In cases where leases have been cancelled, we have the right to cancel our corresponding orders for delivery of those aircraft,” the company said in a quarterly earnings report on Tuesday. Deliveries of Boeing’s best-selling model have been halted for over a year, passing the milestone at which buyers can trigger cancellation clauses, as some leasing firms have done. Still, Kelly told analysts that assuming a successful move by Boeing to recertify the 737 MAX with regulators across the world, the jet would once again see solid demand. He also said there was demand for the Embraer EMBR3.SA E2 jet after the collapse of a tie-up with Boeing last weekend. “AerCap is navigating the coronavirus situation as best they can, tapping additional financing and adjusting their risk profile to airlines they believe can sustain the downturn,” Cowen & Co analyst Helane Becker said in a note. The aviation industry is enduring its worst crisis after the coronavirus pandemic crippled most flights, piling pressure on a sector already weakened by the MAX grounding. Kelly predicted a limited return to service by European airlines in May, lagging the Chinese market by two to three months, but warned not all global airlines would survive. “There is no doubt that some airlines will fail because of the crisis,” Kelly told analysts. There will also be fewer aircraft leasing companies, reversing a flood of capital into the aviation finance market in search of buoyant returns in recent years. That is despite growing government support for airlines that Kelly said could double to $200 billion worldwide, from around $100 billion already committed in bailouts or public support. AerCap’s first-quarter net income rose 18% to $276.8 million, driven partly by asset sales."

9.419767191977071," AerCap warns could scrap some Boeing MAX orders, withdraws outlook May 5 (Reuters) - Aircraft leasing company AerCap Holdings on Tuesday warned it could cancel some Boeing 737 MAX orders and withdrew its full-year outlook amid a slump in travel demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic that has battered business globally. The world’s largest aircraft leasing company said it had lost some of its Boeing 737 MAX leases and expects additional cancellations by airlines in the future. “In cases where leases have been cancelled, we have the right to cancel our corresponding orders for delivery of those aircraft,” the company said in a statement. Last month smaller rival and privately-held Avolon cancelled an order for 75 Boeing 737 MAX planes that were due to be delivered by 2023.

-63.22103576733068," No alternative to grounded Boeing 737 MAX, Aercap CEO says DUBLIN (Reuters) - There is no alternative to the grounded 737 MAX and it would be ""absolutely stupid"" for Boeing BA.N to launch a replacement before the next wave of technology a decade from now, the head of one of the world's top aircraft lessors said on Wednesday. Aengus Kelly, chief executive of Aercap AER.N, which has committed to a fleet of 100 MAX jets, told Reuters in an interview he had spoken to all of the biggest MAX operators in the world and said they still viewed it as a very good plane. Kelly was speaking after Boeing on Tuesday warned of further delays in returning its grounded 737 MAX airliner to service, with the plane not likely to be cleared by U.S. regulators until the middle of the year. He said that some of his customers may cancel leases, but that the majority would not and some are keen to order more. “For people to say this is the end of the MAX, that is absolutely incorrect. These people don’t have much insight,” Kelly said. He said, however, it was still impossible to say when the MAX might fly again. “We saw another delay from Boeing last night – I don’t think they know,” he said. “Is July the last delay? Who knows?” Asked if the MAX might be replaced in the coming years, a move that might undermine the jet’s value, Kelly said it would be absolutely stupid for Boeing to launch a replacement plane before technology allows an additional 15% reduction in fuel burn, something he believes will not happen before 2030. Kelly said all of the main aviation banks were still willing to lend money against the MAX, but added if that changed, the plane’s valuation would be hit. “Are the lessors and the banks willing to still finance the MAX and buy the MAX? The answer to that right now is yes. And if that is the case that puts a floor on the value of the aircraft,” he said. He acknowledged banks may insist on lower loan-to-value ratios on loans issued against the MAX than against rival Airbus planes. Kelly said he would expect Boeing to compensate it if it is forced to take back leases and lease the plane to new airlines. Any costs due to the grounding or any fall in the planes value would also feed into talks on compensation, he said. “We would expect Boeing shareholders to absorb that pain because its their fault not our shareholders,” he said."

Aengus Kelly said the outbreak was hitting traffic in the Chinese New Year when travel and yields peak but that past examples of the SARS and Ebola viruses show that if contained successfully, the impact on traffic will not be long-term. “There’s certainly going to be an impact on the profitability of Chinese airlines in the first quarter,” Kelly, whose customers include some of the world’s biggest airlines, told a conference in Dublin."
-62.18709054369086," AerCap CEO warns against panic discounts for Boeing 737 MAX jets DUBLIN (Reuters) - Owners of Boeing's BA.N grounded 737 MAX jet must keep cool heads and avoid offering panic discounts on sale or lease prices to avoid undermining its long-term value, the head of one of the world's largest aircraft lessors Aercap AER.N said on Monday. ""Discipline and keeping a cool head is vital because if people panic and lease the airplane or sell the airplane at knock-down rates for an extended period of time, it will be harder for the residual value of that asset to recover,"" Aercap's AER.N Aengus Kelly told the Airline Economics aviation finance conference in Dublin. Aercap has 100 Boeing 737 MAX jets on order. “The brand is not in a great place right now and what we need to do is recover that brand operationally and then ... be absolutely disciplined when it comes to placing the aircraft,” Kelly said.

15.168118911373615," AerCap picks up Airbus jet orders dropped by Norwegian: sources PARIS (Reuters) - Orders for five unbuilt Airbus jets relinquished by budget carrier Norwegian Air NWC.OL this week are now under the ownership of leasing company AerCap AER.N as part of a deal to finance deposits on the planes, industry sources said. Airbus on Monday issued monthly data showing that the number of A320neos on order from Norwegian had fallen to 58 from 63. The five planes were also included in a separate tally of nine cancellations posted in September, Airbus data showed. They have now been transferred to AerCap, which reshuffled several of its Airbus orders in September, the sources said, adding the aircraft could be rented back to Norwegian. Norwegian Air said on Wednesday it had not reduced the number of aircraft it intends to take from Airbus AIR.PA. AerCap and Airbus declined to comment. Norwegian Air is Europe’s third-largest budget airline by passenger numbers after Ryanair and easyJet and has shaken up the market with cut-price transatlantic fares. But its rapid expansion has left it with hefty losses and high debt. Industry sources say Norwegian is now in talks with both Airbus and Boeing BA.N about restructuring future orders."
7.113820993621524," Investment losses in AerCap push UAE's Waha into the red ABU DHABI, May 12 (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi-based investment firm Waha Capital on Sunday reported a first-quarter loss, hit by investment losses in AerCap. The firm made a net loss attributable to shareholders of 57.8 million dirhams ($15.8 million) in the three months ending March 31, compared to a net profit of 107.4 million dirhams in the prior-year period, it said in a statement Reuters reported last week that Abu Dhabi investment firm Gulf Capital and Waha Capital have held exploratory discussions regarding a merger, with talks having taken place over the last few months, sources told Reuters last week Waha said on Sunday it incurred a loss of 95 million dirhams on the disposal of shares in AerCap and 100 million dirhams towards reassessment of the value of AerCap’s recoverable amount, it said. Waha’s stake in AerCap stood at 10.3% at the end of March. In recent quarters, tough global market conditions have affected certain investments, and this has been reflected in the bottom line,” said Michael Raynes, chief executive of Waha."
1.904759924105734," Greenlight's David Einhorn pitches long on AerCap, short on GATX at Sohn Conference (Reuters) - David Einhorn, president of Greenlight Capital, at the Sohn Investment Conference on Monday said his firm is positive on airplane leasing company AerCap Holdings and negative on railcar leasing company GATX Corp. Einhorn said GATX has “trouble returning to pre-crisis usage levels,” while AerCorp shares are trading at half the book value and less than half the price-to-earnings of GATX’s shares. Speaking favorably of both industries, he said the airline sector has some advantages over rail that make AerCap the better choice over GATX, whose shares he believes are overvalued. “Neither has consumer-facing businesses, and both have terrible news. AerCap operates in a growing industry with a favorable outlook,” Einhorn said. “We think the market has it wrong.” AerCap shares are up 31% in 2019, while GATX has gained 11% year-to-date. AerCap is the industry leader with 11% marketshare, he noted. As aircraft manufacturers Airbus and Boeing have backlogs of multiple years, aircraft leasing companies step in to fill the gap as air travel continues to increase around the globe. Einhorn, who told the Sohn Investment Conference that the theme of his pitch involved Trains, Planes and Automobiles, referencing a 1987 movie, reassured the audience that he still did not like Tesla Inc. Einhorn started out with a slide show of Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s statements about his electric car company and concluded by saying that’s “a lot of horseshit.” Einhorn has been short Tesla. In a letter to clients last month, Einhorn’s Greenlight renewed criticism of Musk and Tesla, saying the electric car company appeared to be “on the brink” of failure again. The letter cited a lack of demand, “desperate” price cuts, layoffs, “closing-and-then-not-closing” stores, closing service centers, slashing capital expenditures, rushed product announcements and “a new effort to distract investors from the demand problem with hyperbole over TSLA’s autonomous driving capabilities.” Tesla did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Einhorn’s remark."
