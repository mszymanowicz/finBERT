2.440556946182716," U.S. Senate panel to hold Feb 23 hearing on 'SolarWinds' hack WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate intelligence committee will hold a hearing next week on the recent hack against the United States with executives from SolarWinds, Microsoft, FireEye and CrowdStrike, it said in a statement on Thursday. The Feb. 23 hearing comes after the White House’s top cybersecurity adviser said the federal government’s investigation into the sprawling Russian operation would likely take several more months."
-2.2370071198907335," White House cyber adviser says it will take months to investigate Russian hack (Reuters) - The White House’s top cybersecurity adviser said on Wednesday an investigation into a sprawling Russian hacking operation against the United States, known as the SolarWinds hack, will take several more months to complete. White House Deputy National Security Adviser for Cyber and Emerging Technology Anne Neuberger said that a total of nine federal agencies and 100 private-sector companies had been affected by the hack, which first came to light in December. She also said that a number of the affected private-sector companies were technology companies, which were breached to facilitate access to other victims. The FBI, the Department of Homeland Security and several other U.S. government agencies have been digging into affected computer networks ever since the hacks’ discovery to find clues about the attackers. While multiple U.S. government officials have said the hackers came from Russia, they have offered little additional detail. “We believe it took them months to plan and compromise,” said Neuberger. “It will take us some time to uncover this layer by layer.” The Biden administration is currently working on set of cybersecurity policies to prevent a similar style attack, and Neuberger predicted some of these recommendations would become part of an upcoming “executive action.” Government statements and public reporting have revealed that a diverse list of federal agencies were breached by the hackers, including the Justice, Treasury, Homeland Security and Commerce departments. In those cases, the hackers typically attempted to steal emails belonging to high-ranking officials, Reuters previously reported. “When there is a compromise of this scope & scale, both across govt & across the U.S. technology sector to lead to follow on intrusions, it is more than a single incident of espionage,” said Neuberger. “It’s fundamentally of concern for the ability for this to become disruptive.” The recent government cyberattack is commonly referred to as the SolarWinds hack because of how the cyberspies exploited software created and sold by Texas technology company SolarWinds, which makes a popular network management tool that is commonly deployed across both U.S. government and private sector computer networks. While SolarWinds was the first known supply chain victim of this hacking campaign, cybersecurity experts and government officials have cautioned that other technology companies were similarly exploited as part of the same operation."
-2.816912980228105," Blinken discusses U.S. detainees, Navalny and arms control with Russia's Lavrov WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken called for the release of Americans detained in Russia during a call with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov on Thursday that also encompassed nuclear arms control and China, a State Department spokesman said. Blinken also raised with Lavrov Russia’s interference in the 2020 United States election, its military moves in Ukraine and Georgia, the poisoning of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, and last year’s cyberattack on U.S. government agencies that Washington blames on Russia. “The Secretary reiterated President Biden’s resolve to protect American citizens and act firmly in defense of U.S. interests in response to actions by Russia that harm us or our allies,” spokesman Ned Price said in a statement. “This includes the release of Paul Whelan and Trevor Reed so that they are able to return home to their families in the United States.” A Russian court in July convicted Trevor Reed, a student at the University of North Texas, of endangering the lives of two police officers while former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan was sentenced in June to 16 years in jail for espionage. Both Reed and Whelan deny the charges. Blinken took on the role of top U.S. diplomat last week, as the country’s approach to Russia is expected to radically change under President Joe Biden from the friendly attitude embraced by former President Donald Trump’s administration. Despite Washington and Moscow having several disputes, both sides earlier this week announced that they extended the new START arms control treaty for five years, preserving the last treaty limiting deployments of the world’s two largest strategic nuclear arsenals. The Russian foreign ministry said Lavrov told Blinken that Russia was open for normalisation of relations but reminded him that it was necessary to “respect” the law and judicial system of Russia when Blinken raised Navalny. Navalny, one of President Vladimir Putin’s most prominent critics, was arrested at the Russian border on Jan. 17 after returning from Germany where he had been recovering from being poisoned with a military-grade nerve agent. A Russian court handed anti-corruption blogger Navalny a jail sentence on Tuesday."
14.637223974763419," Malwarebytes says some of its emails were breached by SolarWinds hackers WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Cybersecurity company Malwarebytes said on Tuesday that some of its emails were breached by the same hackers who used the software company SolarWinds to hack into a series of U.S. government agencies. In a statement, the Santa Clara, California-based company said that while it did not use software made by SolarWinds, the company at the center of the breach, it had been successfully targeted by the same hackers who were able to sneak into its Microsoft Office 365 and Microsoft Azure environments. Malwarebytes said the hack gave the spies access to “a limited subset of internal company emails.” But it found no evidence of unauthorized access or compromise of its production environments - which could have had a potentially catastrophic impact because the company’s security products are used by millions of people. “Our software remains safe to use,” the company’s statement said. The disclosure was the latest in a series of announcements by digital security firms that they were either compromised or targeted by the hackers, who the U.S. government has judged to be “likely Russian in origin.” The SolarWinds hackers have previously been accused of stealing hacking tools from cybersecurity firm FireEye, accessing an unspecified number of source code repositories at Microsoft and hijacking digital certificates used by email defense firm Mimecast. Cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike said late last month that it too had recently discovered an unsuccessful attempt to steal its emails. The company did not identify the hackers involved but two people familiar with its said they were the same suspected Russian hackers accused of breaching SolarWinds. Russia has denied any involvement in the hacking spree. In a message posted to Twitter, Malwarebytes’ Chief Executive Marcin Kleczynski said the hacking campaign “is much broader than SolarWinds and I expect more companies will come forward soon.”"
17.866666666666664," SolarWinds hackers linked to known Russian spying tools, investigators say LONDON (Reuters) - The group behind a global cyber-espionage campaign discovered last month deployed malicious computer code with links to spying tools previously used by suspected Russian hackers, researchers said on Monday. Investigators at Moscow-based cybersecurity firm Kaspersky said the “backdoor” used to compromise up to 18,000 customers of U.S. software maker SolarWinds closely resembled malware tied to a hacking group known as “Turla,” which Estonian authorities have said operates on behalf of Russia’s FSB security service. The findings are the first publicly-available evidence to support assertions by the United States that Russia orchestrated the hack, which compromised a raft of sensitive federal agencies and is among the most ambitious cyber operations ever disclosed. Moscow has repeatedly denied the allegations. The FSB did not respond to a request for comment. Costin Raiu, head of global research and analysis at Kaspersky, said there were three distinct similarities between the SolarWinds backdoor and a hacking tool called “Kazuar” which is used by Turla. The similarities included the way both pieces of malware attempted to obscure their functions from security analysts, how the hackers identified their victims, and the formula used to calculate periods when the viruses lay dormant in an effort to avoid detection. “One such finding could be dismissed,” Raiu said. “Two things definitely make me raise an eyebrow. Three is more than a coincidence.” Confidently attributing cyberattacks is extremely difficult and strewn with possible pitfalls. When Russian hackers disrupted the Winter Olympics opening ceremony in 2018, for example, they deliberately imitated a North Korean group to try and deflect the blame. Raiu said the digital clues uncovered by his team did not directly implicate Turla in the SolarWinds compromise, but did show there was a yet-to-be determined connection between the two hacking tools. It’s possible they were deployed by the same group, he said, but also that Kazuar inspired the SolarWinds hackers, both tools were purchased from the same spyware developer, or even that the attackers planted “false flags” to mislead investigators. Security teams in the United States and other countries are still working to determine the full scope of the SolarWinds hack. Investigators have said it could take months to understand the extent of the compromise and even longer to evict the hackers from victim networks. U.S. intelligence agencies have said the hackers were “likely Russian in origin” and targeted a small number of high-profile victims as part of an intelligence-gathering operation."

6.0317523809523825," U.S. cyber agency says SolarWinds hackers are 'impacting' state, local governments WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. cybersecurity agency said on Wednesday that a sprawling cyber espionage campaign made public earlier this month is affecting state and local governments, although it released few additional details. The hacking campaign, which used U.S. tech company SolarWinds as a springboard to penetrate federal government networks, was “impacting enterprise networks across federal, state, and local governments, as well as critical infrastructure entities and other private sector organizations,” the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) said in a statement posted to its website. The CISA said last week that U.S. government agencies, critical infrastructure entities, and private groups were among those affected, but did not specifically mention state or local bodies. So far only a handful of federal government agencies have officially confirmed having been affected, including the U.S. Treasury Department, the Commerce Department, and the Department of Energy. CISA did not identify the state or local agencies affected and did not immediately return an email seeking additional detail on the notice. Reuters has previously reported that Pima County, Arizona was among the victims of the wave of intrusions. The county did not immediately return a message seeking comment late Wednesday. The county’s chief information officer previously told Reuters his team had taken its SolarWinds software offline immediately after the hack became public and that investigators had not found any evidence of a further compromise. Senior U.S. officials and lawmakers have alleged that Russia is to blame for the hacking spree, a charge the Kremlin denies."
21.438638928067714," Second hacking team was targeting SolarWinds at time of big breach (Reuters) - A second hacking group, different from the suspected Russian team now associated with the major SolarWinds data breach, also targeted the company’s products earlier this year, according to a security research blog by Microsoft. “The investigation of the whole SolarWinds compromise led to the discovery of an additional malware that also affects the SolarWinds Orion product but has been determined to be likely unrelated to this compromise and used by a different threat actor,” the blog said. Security experts told Reuters this second effort is known as “SUPERNOVA.” It is a piece of malware that imitates SolarWinds’ Orion product but it is not “digitally signed” like the other attack, suggesting this second group of hackers did not share access to the network management company’s internal systems. It is unclear whether SUPERNOVA has been deployed against any targets, such as customers of SolarWinds. The malware appears to have been created in late March, based on a review of the file’s compile times. The new finding shows how more than one sophisticated hacking group viewed SolarWinds, an Austin, Texas-based company that was not a household name until this month, as an important gateway to penetrate other targets. In a statement, a SolarWinds spokesman did not address SUPERNOVA, but said the company “remains focused on collaborating with customers and experts to share information and work to better understand this issue.” “It remains early days of the investigation,” the spokesman said."

-5.546311395101975," Hackers used SolarWinds' dominance against it in sprawling spy campaign WASHINGTON (Reuters) - On an earnings call two months ago, SolarWinds Chief Executive Kevin Thompson touted how far the company had gone during his 11 years at the helm. There was not a database or an IT deployment model out there to which his Austin, Texas-based company did not provide some level of monitoring or management, he told analysts on the Oct. 27 call. “We don’t think anyone else in the market is really even close in terms of the breadth of coverage we have,” he said. “We manage everyone’s network gear.” Now that dominance has become a liability - an example of how the workhorse software that helps glue organizations together can turn toxic when it is subverted by sophisticated hackers. On Monday, SolarWinds confirmed that Orion - its flagship network management software - had served as the unwitting conduit for a sprawling international cyberespionage operation. The hackers inserted malicious code into Orion software updates pushed out to nearly 18,000 customers. And while the number of affected organizations is thought to be much more modest, the hackers have already parlayed their access into consequential breaches at the U.S. Treasury and Department of Commerce. Three people familiar with the investigation have told Reuters that Russia is a top suspect, although others familiar with the inquiry have said it is still too early to tell. A SolarWinds representative, Ryan Toohey, said he would not be making executives available for comment. He did not provide on-the-record answers to questions sent via email. In a statement issued Sunday, the company said “we strive to implement and maintain appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards, security processes, procedures, and standards designed to protect our customers.” Cybersecurity experts are still struggling to understand the scope of the damage. The malicious updates - sent between March and June, when America was hunkering down to weather the first wave of coronavirus infections - was “perfect timing for a perfect storm,” said Kim Peretti, who co-chairs Atlanta-based law firm Alston & Bird’s cybersecurity preparedness and response team. Assessing the damage would be difficult, she said. “We may not know the true impact for many months, if not more – if not ever,” she said. The impact on SolarWinds was more immediate. U.S. officials ordered anyone running Orion to immediately disconnect it. The company’s stock has tumbled more than 23% from $23.50 on Friday - before Reuters broke the news of the breach - to $18.06 on Tuesday. SolarWinds’ security, meanwhile, has come under new scrutiny. In one previously unreported issue, multiple criminals have offered to sell access to SolarWinds’ computers through underground forums, according to two researchers who separately had access to those forums. One of those offering claimed access over the Exploit forum in 2017 was known as “fxmsp” and is wanted by the FBI “for involvement in several high-profile incidents,” said Mark Arena, chief executive of cybercrime intelligence firm Intel471. Arena informed his company’s clients, which include U.S. law enforcement agencies. Security researcher Vinoth Kumar told Reuters that, last year, he alerted the company that anyone could access SolarWinds’ update server by using the password “solarwinds123” “This could have been done by any attacker, easily,” Kumar said. Neither the password nor the stolen access is considered the most likely source of the current intrusion, researchers said. Others - including Kyle Hanslovan, the cofounder of Maryland-based cybersecurity company Huntress - noticed that, days after SolarWinds realized their software had been compromised, the malicious updates were still available for download. The firm has long mooted the idea of spin-off of its managed service provider business and on Dec. 9 announced that Thompson would be replaced by Sudhakar Ramakrishna, the former chief executive of Pulse Secure. Three weeks ago, SolarWinds posted a job ad seeking a new vice president for security; the position is still listed as open. Thompson and Ramakrishna could not be reached for comment."
-12.130483581524793," Breakingviews - Sensitive U.S. hack is one more problem for Biden NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - For some government departments and big companies, 2020 just got even worse. Widely used network-management software produced by Austin, Texas-based SolarWinds was hacked, allowing monitoring, perhaps by Russia. With the U.S. military and the Treasury Department potential targets, it’s one more significant headache for President-elect Joe Biden. The SolarWinds software helps organizations monitor what’s going on inside their networks: where users log in, what kind of traffic is flowing and so on. According to a FireEye research report, malicious elements were introduced into software updates for SolarWinds products. The company said these were released between March and June. Hacking may have been targeted because manual intervention was required, but a state actor has the resources to cover quite a bit of ground. The latest intrusion, in which Russia denies involvement despite reports to the contrary, came to light last week when cybersecurity outfit FireEye said it had been hacked itself. Over the weekend, it became clear problems could be far wider and email traffic at the U.S. Treasury and the Commerce Department may have been monitored for months, according to Reuters. It’s an embarrassing-looking incident for SolarWinds, worth $7.4 billion at Friday’s market closing price. The stock fell more than 10% in morning trade on Monday. But it’s a bigger deal for those who turn out to have been affected. SolarWinds says its customers include all five branches of the U.S. armed forces, hundreds of the biggest companies, top auditing firms and more. The attention of the public, governments and corporate boards has been absorbed all year by the massive demands of the Covid-19 pandemic. Hackers, though, have seized the moment, with episodes of ransomware, for example, surging this year according to news reports. It’s a rude reminder for company directors that if they’ve diverted attention to Covid-19, they had better return to cybersecurity pronto. It’s also potentially a big problem for Biden’s incoming administration in Washington. On top of managing the coronavirus response, it means the politically toxic mix of hacking, Russia and sensitive emails could be back on the agenda."
-12.130483581524793," SolarWinds says that 'fewer than 18,000 customers' had software compromised in hack (Reuters) - IT company SolarWinds said Monday that ‘fewer than 18,000 customers’ had software compromised in a damaging hack that led to intrusions at the Departments of Treasury and Commerce. In a statement that provided the first detailed outline of the compromise, SolarWinds said that the hack “was used to compromise the company’s emails” and possibly gather other data as well. The company said it had retained third-party cybersecurity experts to assist in its investigation."
-12.130483581524793," Global security teams assess impact of suspected Russian cyber attack LONDON/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Global security teams moved on Monday to contain the fallout of a widespread cyberattack by suspected Russian hackers, who have been able to spy on the customers of U.S. information technology company SolarWinds unnoticed for more than eight months. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security issued an emergency warning on Sunday, ordering users to disconnect and disable SolarWinds software which it said had been compromised by “malicious actors.” The U.S. warning came after Reuters reported that suspected Russian hackers had used hijacked software updates to break into multiple American government agencies, including the Treasury and Commerce departments. Russia denied having any connection to the attacks. The potential scale of the compromise is enormous. SolarWinds boasts 300,000 customers, including the majority of the United States’ Fortune 500 companies, and some of the most sensitive agencies in the U.S. government - including the Pentagon, the National Security Agency, and the White House. Two people familiar with the investigation told Reuters that any organisation running an updated version of the company’s Orion network management software would have had a “backdoor” installed in their computer systems by the attackers. “After that, it’s just a question of whether the attackers decide to exploit that access further,” said one of the sources. However initial indications suggest that the hackers were discriminating about who they chose to break into, according to two people familiar with the wave of corporate cybersecurity investigations being launched Monday morning. One executive said his company was hunting for SolarWinds-related compromises but had found “surprisingly little.” “We are seeing some things light up, but not what I would have thought was the market penetration of SolarWinds,” he said. Another person familiar with a second company’s investigation into the hack said that the hackers appeared mission-focused. “What we see is far fewer than all the possibilities,” he said. “They are using this like a scalpel.” SolarWinds has declined to put a figure on the number of customers affected by the breach, but said the attack appeared to be “narrow, extremely targeted, and manually executed.” Investigators around the world are now scrambling to find out who was hit. FireEye, a prominent cybersecurity company that was breached in connection with the incident, said in a blog post here that other targets included ""government, consulting, technology, telecom and extractive entities in North America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East."" Microsoft said in a blog post here they had first seen malicious copies of the SolarWinds software deployed by the hackers last March. In Britain, where publicly-available SolarWinds sales documents show multiple government departments use the company’s software, a spokesman for Prime Minister Boris Johnson said investigations were ongoing. “The National Cyber Security Centre is working to assess any UK impact, but we’re not aware of any UK-related impact at this time,” the spokesman told reporters. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the allegations reported by Reuters and other media outlets were false. “If there have been attacks for many months, and the Americans could not do anything about it, it is probably not worth immediately groundlessly blaming the Russians,” he said. “We didn’t have anything to do with it.”"
