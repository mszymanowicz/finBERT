-7.286887024064782," H&R Block adds to bargain-hunter rally inspired by bets on reopening, Biden (Reuters) - H&R Block Inc HRB.N gained slightly on Friday after rallying in 13 out of the last 14 sessions as bargain-hunting investors had bet a Joe Biden presidency will help the virus-battered tax preparer along with a coronavirus vaccine. The stock, while dramatically underperforming the market year-to-date, has recently outperformed noticeably. On Friday it was up 0.1% at $17.76 after rising 27.6% from Sept 18 to Thursday's close. The S&P 400 .IDX was up 0.5% on Friday after gaining 6.8% between Sept. 18 and Thursday. H&R Block has fallen about 24% year-to-date versus a roughly 3% drop in the index. BTIG analyst Mark Palmer said the rally has hinged on investor expectations going forward “politically and in terms of the pandemic.” While Trump in 2016 promised a tax code so simple it would put H&R Block out of business, investors see Biden tax changes leading consumers back to H&R Block. On Thursday, its shares closed 20% lower than the day Trump won the 2016 election. “Obviously it didn’t have the kind of impact (Trump) was ascribing,” said Palmer. “The flip side is the view that if we see significant tax changes under a democratic administration there could be an increased need for consumers to seek help.” Investors are also betting a coronavirus vaccine will allow more in-person tax appointments. “HRB’s ability to operate was severely impaired by the pandemic ... particularly for their in-store assisted tax preparation,” said Palmer who rates the stock neutral. Barrington Research analyst Alexander Paris sees a low price to earnings ratio as a key to the recent rally with the stock trading around 5 times his 2020 earnings per share estimate and 4 times his 2021 estimate versus a five-year average of 13.5. Also Paris expects a much better 2021 than 2020 when tax day moved from April to July because of the coronavirus lockdown."

Utmost's new product comes as the number of contract workers grows in corporate America, from cleaners and other shift workers to software engineers and other white-collar freelancers. Last week, Uber Technologies Inc UBER.N launched Uber Works, a platform that helps connect workers with businesses that need to fill shifts. Utmost currently does not match employers with workers, but said it could consider doing so in the future. The Utmost platform focuses on helping large companies manage contract workers. The app helps facilitate several human resources (HR) services, such as on-boarding, pay and benefits.

4.728790715630723," H&R Block's heavy investments to weigh on future profits, shares sink (Reuters) - Shares of H&R Block Inc HRB.N fell as much as 21 percent on Wednesday, after the tax preparer said it expected profit margins to shrink as it invests heavily in technology to lure clients who do their own taxes. H&R, which helps corporations and individuals prepare their tax filings, might also see fewer clients using its services because the recent tax overhaul has made it simpler for people to file their taxes. The company is investing heavily in technology, changing pricing plans and will consolidate 400 offices to cut costs. Analysts believed it would take several years for those initiatives to take hold. “H&R’s spend could be multi-year and visibility into payback metrics on the initiatives appears low currently,” said Hamzah Mazari, an analyst with Macquarie in a note entitled ‘The good, the bad and the outlook’. On a post-earnings conference call on Tuesday, the company said it expects full-year 2019 EBITDA margin to be between 24 percent and 26 percent, down from 29.8 percent in 2018. The company also sees revenue of between $3.05 billion and $3.1 billion in 2019, down from $3.16 billion it earned in 2018. The outlook overshadowed the company’s better-than-expected fourth-quarter profit, typically the busiest period for tax preparers due to the U.S. tax filing deadline. “Given a volatile track record of results and lack of visibility into if management’s initiatives will pay off, our expectations come down,” Morgan Stanley’s Thomas Allen said in a note. Shares of the company were down 19 percent at $23.93 in morning trading."
