12.97054122499954," CIBC profit beats estimates on lower bad loan provisions (Reuters) - Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) joined its rivals in reporting a better-than-expected profit for the fourth quarter on Thursday, as it set aside less money to cover potential bad loans arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. Bank of Nova Scotia, Bank of Montreal, National Bank of Canada and Royal Bank of Canada all cut their provisions after three straight quarters of adding for credit losses. CIBC set aside $291 million for the provisions in the fourth quarter ended Oct. 31, down 28% from a year earlier. Net income fell 14% to C$1.02 billion ($788.80 million), as weakness at CIBC’s U.S. commercial banking and wealth management businesses offset gains in its capital markets unit. Canada’s big 6 banks have reported strong results from their capital market businesses in the quarter, helped by increased volatility in markets due to the health crisis. CIBC reported an adjusted diluted profit of C$2.79 per share, beating analysts’ average expectation of C$2.52 per share, according to Refinitiv. ($1 = 1.2931 Canadian dollars)"
13.639985792559017," Scotiabank, BMO beat estimates on lower-than-feared provisions TORONTO (Reuters) - Bank of Nova Scotia and Bank of Montreal (BMO) beat analysts’ estimates for fourth-quarter profit as they set aside less funds than expected to cover potential loan losses due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Canadian banks have braced for higher loan losses this year and 2021 as the pandemic ravages the global economy and leads to lower household income, with a plunge in oil prices also likely to result in higher defaults in the energy sector. Both banks reporting on Tuesday, however, put aside far less than analysts had expected in the quarter to Oct. 31, while BMO also said it would wind down its non-Canadian investment and corporate energy business to cut costs. “Going forward, BMO Capital Market’s Energy business will be focused on the Canadian Energy market, where we believe our competitive positioning is strongest,” a spokesman for the bank said. Scotiabank reported loan loss provisions of C$1.13 billion ($871.04 million), compared with analysts’ expectations of C$1.44 billion, Refinitiv IBES data showed. BMO posted provisions for credit losses of C$432 million, versus estimates of C$712.7 million. BMO’s results also benefited from the strong performance of its wealth management and capital markets businesses, pushing net income attributable to equity holders of the bank 33% higher to C$1.58 billion, or C$2.37 per share. On an adjusted basis, the bank earned a profit of C$2.41 per share, beating estimates of C$1.90 per share. Scotiabank’s adjusted net income attributable to shareholders fell to C$1.8 billion ($1.46 billion), or C$1.45 a share, but was higher than estimates of C$1.22 a share.

25.169110790810233," Canada's RBC, BMO offer subdued outlook, miss profit estimates as bad loan provisions surge TORONTO (Reuters) - Royal Bank of Canada and Bank of Montreal on Wednesday offered subdued outlooks after missing quarterly earnings expectations as they increased provisions more than six-fold to cover future loan losses due to the COVID-19 outbreak. RBC shares climbed 2.9% in morning trade, while BMO fell 0.2% versus a 2.5% gain in the benchmark banks index. While much of the spikes in provisions were for performing loans, they nevertheless point to banks’ expectations for a surge in loan losses due to the pandemic. On Tuesday, Bank of Nova Scotia and National Bank of Canada also reported steep declines in profits. Shares of National Bank, which reported after markets closed, rose 4% on Wednesday. “Given the historic level of economic stress due to COVID-19, we would not expect to see a reduction in impaired loan losses over the next few quarters,” and even expect increases in some troubled sectors, such as energy, Patrick Cronin, chief risk officer at BMO, said on an analyst call. BMO, Canada’s fourth-biggest bank, posted adjusted profit of C$1.04 per share for the three months through April, compared with expectations for C$1.22, as its capital markets business recorded a surprising loss. But its provisions of C$1.1 billion were lower than expected, prompting analyst concerns about their adequacy. RBC, the nation’s biggest lender, reported adjusted earnings of C$1.03 per share, missing estimates for C$1.58, as provisions jumped to C$2.8 billion, from C$426 million a year earlier. “We favour management’s more conservative approach to provisioning that we believe positions Royal bank on a more solid footing for the uncertainty that lies ahead,” Credit Suisse analysts wrote in a note. Earnings and returns on equity will remain suppressed, but should pick up in 2022 when the economy recovers, RBC Chief Financial Officer Rod Bolger said on an analyst call."
25.169110790810233," Bank of Montreal profit misses mark as credit losses loom (Reuters) - Bank of Montreal BMO.TO on Wednesday reported quarterly profit below analysts' estimates as it set aside more money to cover potential loan losses stemming from the coronavirus pandemic. Canadian banks are expecting to book higher loan losses this year and the next as the COVID-19 pandemic ravages economies and household incomes. They also expect a hit from a plunge in oil prices, which has hurt the energy sector globally. BMO set aside C$1.12 billion for future loan losses, vastly higher than C$176 million a year earlier. The figure includes a $705 million provision for credit losses on performing loans in the current quarter, compared with a $26 million provision a year earlier. Bank of Nova Scotia BNS.TO kicked off bank earnings for the first quarter on Tuesday and revealed that credit provisions more than doubled to C$1.85 billion from a year earlier, highlighting the damage from the pandemic. Analysts expect second-quarter profit at Canada’s biggest banks to slide by more than a third from a year earlier also due to margin pressure from decade-low interest rates. BMO said net income fell to C$689 million ($501.05 million), or C$1 per share, in the second quarter ended April 30 from C$1.49 billion, or C$2.26 per share, a year earlier. Adjusted net income fell to C$1.04 per share from C$2.30 per share a year earlier. Analysts had expected C$1.22 a share. BMO’s capital markets unit reported a net loss of $74 million from a profit a year earlier, while its wealth management, Canadian, and U.S. personal and commercial businesses all posted a drop in net income. The bank’s return on equity was 5.3%, compared with 13.6% in the prior year. It however, maintained its dividend from the previous quarter."

16.05351886032707," Scotiabank's international strength buffers it from provisions that hit rival BMO (Reuters) - Canadian lender Bank of Nova Scotia BNS.TO beat estimates for quarterly profit on Tuesday, as strength in its international division buffered the bank from higher credit provisions, a factor that led rival Bank of Montreal BMO.TO to disappoint. Scotiabank’s shares rose 1.7% to C$68.90 in morning trading in Toronto, while BMO dropped 3.3% to C$89.33, its lowest since Jan. 7. Banks in Canada are seeing increased credit provisions on elevated household debt-to-income ratios and struggles in the oil and gas sector, while margins and capital markets businesses face pressure from a global economic slowdown and trade uncertainties. BMO reported a 64.5% jump in loan-loss provisions of during the quarter from a year ago. Scotiabank posted a 35% rise excluding one-off provisions taken a year earlier, although the level was below analyst expectations. Although Scotiabank posted slower loan growth than BMO -- 6.3% vs 12.4% -- its international business, the biggest among major Canadian banks, drove its performance. That overseas presence for Scotiabank is focused on the Latin American trading bloc comprising Mexico, Peru, Chile and Colombia. A 14% jump in adjusted earnings in Scotia’s international business to C$815 million ($613.94 million), compared with 2.9% growth in domestic operations to C$1.17 billion, helped lift the results of Canada’s third-biggest lender, and offset a 15% decline in profit from its global banking and markets unit. The gains were driven largely by a 28% surge in profit in the Chile business, thanks to the acquisition of BBVA Chile, which helped shield Scotia from a 20% decline in earnings in Mexico due to lower margins. Acquisitions made last year, including BBVA Chile, Citibank’s Colombian retail operation overseas, a controlling interest in Cencosud Peru, Jarislosky Fraser and MD Financial, will contribute about C$400 million to earnings in 2020, executives said on an analyst call. This is higher than the 15 cents a share the bank had forecast earlier, they said. “After four consecutive misses on earnings, we are encouraged” by Scotiabank’s results, analysts at Canaccord Genuity wrote in a note. While BMO was the first major Canadian bank to post third-quarter earnings growth in its capital markets business, with profit rising 5% from a year ago, that was eroded by lower earnings from its wealth management unit and a mere 1% increase in its Canadian and U.S. retail business income. “The bank’s revenue and non-interest expenses were slightly better than we had expected, although that was more than offset by higher loan loss provisions,” analysts at Credit Suisse wrote in a note. “The wealth segment was a drag due to weaker insurance earnings... while more concerning was a C$0.05/share miss on U.S. (personal and commercial) banking as margins were materially lower than last quarter.” BMO’s Canadian consumer loan losses are expected to normalize over the next few quarters, and expense growth in the second half of the year will be half the rate of the first six months, executives said on a conference call. BMO earned C$2.38 a share excluding items, compared to analyst expectations for C$2.49 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Scotiabank’s adjusted earnings, excluding items like a one-time loss related to the sale of its operations in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, was C$1.88 per share, compared with analysts’ estimates of C$1.85. Last week, Royal Bank of Canada RY.TO, the nation’s biggest bank by market value, and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce CM.TO, the most domestically focused lender, posted profit increases. This was driven by their wealth management divisions, particularly in the U.S., and lending at home, which offset slowdowns in their capital markets businesses. Both banks also warned of the potential impact on margins of a slowdown in global economic growth and the resulting monetary policy easing by central banks."

-7.588747323218276," BMO outshines Scotiabank with forecast-busting quarter TORONTO (Reuters) - Bank of Montreal outshone rival Canadian lender Bank of Nova Scotia on Tuesday, posting third-quarter earnings that came in ahead of market expectations, helped by growth in the United States. Shares in Scotiabank, down 5 percent since the start of the year, were 1.8 percent lower at 1 p.m. EDT (1700 GMT). Shares in BMO, up 5 percent so far this year, were down 0.25 percent, with the broader market for Canadian banks 0.5 percent lower.. BMO, Canada’s fourth-biggest lender, said earnings per share, excluding one-off items, jumped 16 percent to C$2.36 in the quarter ended July 31, compared with the average analyst forecast of C$2.27, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income, excluding one-off items, at the bank’s U.S. business grew by 34 percent, benefiting in part from tax changes. Net income, excluding one-off items, at its Canadian business rose 5 percent. Scotiabank, Canada’s third-biggest lender, reported a 5 percent increase in third-quarter earnings, in line with market expectations. Earnings per share, excluding one-off items, rose to C$1.76 ($1.35) in the quarter ended July 31, up from C$1.68 a year ago. Analysts had on average forecast earnings per share of C$1.75, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce analyst Robert Sedran said BMO had benefited from a strong U.S. performance and also highlighted its investment banking business, which lifted net income by 7 percent helped by stronger trading revenues. In contrast, he said Scotiabank’s performance was unlikely to be greeted positively by the market since other Canadian banks had exceeded expectations this quarter. Royal Bank of Canada and CIBC both beat forecasts last week. Scotiabank, which has the biggest overseas presence of Canada’s major banks, said its net income, excluding one-off items, rose to C$2.26 billion during the period, from C$2.12 billion in the year-ago quarter. The bank’s international business grew net income by 15 percent, helped by loan growth of over 10 percent in the Pacific Alliance trading bloc, comprising Mexico, Peru, Chile and Colombia, where its international strategy is focused. Speaking to reporters, Chief Executive Brian Porter said Monday’s announcement of a preliminary trade deal between the United States and Mexico was a “solid step in the right direction,” and he was hopeful a deal with Canada will be agreed. “This alleviates ambiguity in the market’s mind,” he said. “We look forward to the next piece of NAFTA being solved with Canada’s inclusion.” ($1 = 1.3055 Canadian dollars)"
7.059872751157151," Cyber crooks claim to hit two big Canadian banks TORONTO (Reuters) - Bank of Montreal BMO.TO and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce CM.TO said on Monday that cyber attackers may have stolen the data of nearly 90,000 customers in what appeared to be the first significant assault on financial institutions in the country. Bank of Montreal BMO.TO, Canada's fourth biggest lender, said on Monday it was contacted by fraudsters on Sunday who claimed they were in possession of the personal and financial information of a limited number of the bank's customers. A spokesman for the bank said it believed that less than 50,000 of the bank’s 8 million customers across Canada were hacked. He declined to say if any customers lost money as a result of the attack. The fraudsters had threatened to make the data public, the spokesman said, adding that the bank was working with the authorities and conducting a thorough investigation. Bank of Montreal said it believed the attack originated from outside the country and was confident the exposures that led to the theft of customer data had been closed off. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce CM.TO, Canada's fifth biggest lender, said fraudsters contacted the lender on Sunday claiming they had electronically stolen personal and account information of 40,000 customers of its Simplii direct banking brand. CIBC said it has not yet confirmed the cyber breach but is taking the claim seriously. CIBC said customers at its main banking division were not affected. Both banks said they were contacting customers and advising them to monitor their accounts and report any suspicious activity. Other Canadian banks said they had not been affected. Shares in BMO were down 0.3 percent and CIBC was off 0.3 percent. Canada’s six biggest banks have been collaborating along with the Bank of Canada to enhance their defenses against cyber attacks. The Bank of Canada said earlier this month that some attacks would inevitably succeed but it has recovery mechanisms in place to limit the damage. Cyber attacks are increasingly common. Last year, credit monitoring firm Equifax said information on about 146.6 million names, 146.6 million dates of birth, 145.5 million U.S. social security numbers, 99 million addresses and 209,000 payment card numbers and expiration dates, were stolen in a cyber attack."
