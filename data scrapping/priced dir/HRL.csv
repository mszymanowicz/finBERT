-1.4813639026514844," Breakingviews - Capital Calls: Hormel’s snack splurge New York (Reuters Breakingviews) - Concise insights on global finance in the Covid-19 era. A LITTLE BIT NUTS. Hormel Foods is buying peanuts, but at a price that is anything but. The $27 billion maker of meat products including World War Two staple Spam is buying Kraft Heinz’s nut business, including the Planters brand, for $3.4 billion. The math looks salty. Hormel will acquire a business with just over $220 million of EBITDA this year, the company’s presentation suggested on Thursday. Deduct depreciation equivalent to, say, 2% of sales, and that leaves $200 million of operating profit. After tax, it’s a return on investment of just 5.7%. Sure, there are “synergies” of up to $60 million. Hormel has other nut-based products like Skippy peanut butter. But these benefits could take until 2024 to come through, and roughly a third of them depend on making extra sales, rather than cutting costs. Even factoring them in fully, the return is still less than 8%. That may explain why shareholders docked about $1 billion of Hormel’s market value on Thursday. The retreat from meat doesn’t come cheap. (By Amanda Gomez)"
-1.4813639026514844," Kraft Heinz to sell nuts business to Hormel for $3.35 billion (Reuters) - Kraft Heinz Co said on Thursday it was selling its nut business to packaged food peer Hormel Foods Corp for $3.35 billion in cash. The transaction includes most products sold under the Planters brand, including single variety and mixed nuts, trail mix, Nut-rition products, Cheez Balls, and Cheez Curls, as well as Corn Nuts branded products."
-3.519928619182569," Kraft Heinz in talks to sell Planters snack business for about $3 billion: WSJ (Reuters) - Kraft Heinz Co is in talks to sell its Planters snack business to Skippy peanut butter maker Hormel Foods Corp for about $3 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported here on Tuesday, citing people familiar with the matter. The deal could be announced as soon as next week if talks do not fall apart, the Journal said, adding that the deal would be Hormel’s largest to date. Planters, which mainly sells nuts and snack mixes with labels featuring its popular Mr. Peanut mascot, would be the latest addition to Hormel’s portfolio that includes chillis, frozen meats and condiments. Sales of pantry staples surged at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic as consumers prepared for lockdowns, but have since waned as restrictions were lifted, leading to companies restructuring their businesses accordingly. Kraft Heinz in September sold its natural cheese business to France’s Groupe Lactalis for $3.2 billion, while Mondelez International Inc bought chocolate-bar maker Hu Master Holdings last month. Kraft and Hormel declined to comment on the report."
-8.63914534842467," Hormel Foods warns of supply shortages on COVID-19 hit (Reuters) - Spam-maker Hormel Foods Corp on Tuesday warned that it would have a hard time meeting high demand for certain products because of supply chain, staffing and production problems brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Hormel also said it had to find alternate ways to increase production, including relying on co-manufacturing partners. The surge in demand came just as coronavirus outbreaks forced the closure of some of the biggest U.S. meatpacking plants, threatening to cause massive shortages in the nation’s meat supply. “The magnitude of additional recovery in the foodservice industry, the performance of the entire food supply chain and the state of the broader economy remain highly uncertain,” Chief Executive Officer Jim Snee said. [nPn1BmCJBa] The company has had to reduce the number of employees working at a time in its plants with staggered shifts and expanded temperature screenings to prevent transmission of the virus. The company estimates supply chain costs to be around $80 million to $100 million in fiscal 2020. However, the Skippy peanut butter maker on Tuesday posted a better-than-expected profit for the third quarter, citing a pick-up in its business at restaurants. Still, Snee added that though the foodservice business has seen a rebound, it was still below last year and expects the trend to continue into the fourth quarter. Shares of the company were down 1%."

-1.6840442905919735," Hormel joins Tyson Foods, JBS in removing drug banned by China from hog supply CHICAGO (Reuters) - Spam-maker Hormel Foods Corp HRL.N is eliminating a growth drug banned by China from its hog supply, the company said on Tuesday, joining rivals that are seeking to increase meat sales to Chinese buyers grappling with a pork shortage. Hormel will not accept any hogs that have been fed or exposed to the drug ractopamine after April 1, the company said in a statement. Tyson Foods Inc TSN.N and JBS USA said last year they would remove the drug from their supply chains. The companies' moves ramped up the competition to profit from increased demand in China, the world's largest pork consumer, where an outbreak of the fatal pig disease African swine fever has decimated herds. “We have been actively monitoring the changing global market dynamics for several years and believe this decision will further position us to meet growing international demand,” Hormel said. Ractopamine is used in some countries to raise leaner pigs, but China does not allow its use or tolerate residues in imported meat. The European Union also bans ractopamine. Elanco Animal Health Inc ELAN.N manufactures Paylean, its brand name for a ractopamine feed ingredient. “We’re disappointed in any decision that would take safe, proven technology out of the hands of farmers,” Elanco said. China is expected to buy more U.S. pork after agreeing to significantly increase imports of American farm goods as part of an interim trade deal reached last month with Washington. Beijing said it will grant exemptions on retaliatory tariffs imposed against 696 U.S. goods, including pork, that had hampered American exports. China agreed as part of the trade deal to work with U.S. experts to “conduct a risk assessment for ractopamine in cattle and swine as soon as possible without undue delay,” according to the agreement. It said the countries will establish a joint working group to discuss the steps to be taken based on the results of the assessment. Chinese pork prices last week neared a record set in 2019 after measures to battle the coronavirus epidemic disrupted the transportation of pigs and the restart of slaughtering plants, crimping already tight supplies. Hormel, which sells ham, pork tenderloin and other meat products, does not slaughter hogs itself. Instead, it partners with third-party suppliers that process the animals for Hormel’s raw materials."

18.955866547145995," Hormel Foods sees up to 6 cents tariff impact on annual profit (Reuters) - Hormel Foods Corp's HRL.N quarterly sales missed estimates on Thursday and the packaged food maker said its profit will take a hit of up to six cents per share annually due to the U.S.-China tariffs, sending its stock down as much as 5.5 percent. A few weeks ago bigger rival Tyson Foods TSN.N too had cut its full-year profit forecast due to the impact of tariffs on domestic and export prices of meat. Following U.S. tariffs on aluminum and steel imports, China retaliated with tariffs on U.S. pork and beef, with Mexico and Canada also implementing levies. This led to over supplies of red meats, pushing the prices for chicken and turkey lower in the domestic market. “We do see risk from tariffs, which could negatively impact fresh pork exports and the (international) segment’s results,” James Snee, chief executive officer of Hormel, said on a post-earnings call with analysts. CFO James Sheehan said hog prices were 10 percent lower in the third quarter compared to a year earlier and expects the trend to continue into the current quarter. Turkey prices have also been hit due to excess availability and cheap prices for pork and beef. Poultry producer Sanderson Farms Inc SAFM.O also reported quarterly results that missed estimates, blaming tariffs that have led to excess supply of competing proteins in the United States. Overall, Hormel said it expects to see a four to six cent per share impact to profit every year, mainly due to China’s 62 percent tariff on U.S. pork products. However, the company maintained its current year forecast of $1.85-$1.95 per share, despite expecting a 1 to 2 cent impact from tariffs. Hormel’s quarterly sales of $2.36 billion missed estimates for third straight quarter. Analysts on average had expected$2.38 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Shares of Hormel, which sells packaged meat under the Jennie-O and Natural Choice brands, pared losses to trade 2.5 percent lower at $37.63 in morning trading."

The company said it expects to see a four to six cent per share impact to profit every year due to China’s tariffs on U.S. pork that has hit its exports as well as U.S. tariffs on aluminum and steel that has led to higher packaging costs.
