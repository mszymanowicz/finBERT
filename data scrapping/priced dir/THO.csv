6.591972783110385," Thor takeover target Hymer suspends managers after accounting flaws FRANKFURT, Jan 21 (Reuters) - German family-owned caravan maker Erwin Hymer Group, which is being taken over by U.S. peer Thor Industries, said on Monday that it has suspended managers amid an investigation into accounting irregularities. Hymer said that it is currently probing activities of its North America unit and that it is working with external auditors on the matter. Thor, which announced in September that it would buy Hymer in a 2.1 billion euro ($2.4 billion) deal, said earlier on Monday that it was finalizing discussions with Hymer to exclude the North American operations from the deal. Thor added that it expects the acquisition to be completed within company’s fiscal third quarter. ($1 = 0.8799 euros) (Reporting by Arno Schuetze Editing by Ludwig Burger)"
-49.637454704485236," U.S. Thor Industries to buy German caravan maker Hymer FRANKFURT (Reuters) - U.S.-based recreational vehicle maker Thor Industries THO.N has agreed to buy German family-owned caravan maker Erwin Hymer Group in a deal valuing the company at 2.1 billion euros ($2.45 billion)including debt, Thor said on Tuesday. The deal, which was flagged by Reuters last week, will see the U.S. builder of mobile homes and caravans pay the bulk of the price in cash. It will also issue 2.3 million of its shares to the Hymer family. Thor shares closed at $97.55 on Monday. Thor said it expected the transaction to be accretive to earnings in the first year. Thor Chief Executive Bob Martin said the investment case was not based on cutting the workforce. “No job cuts are planned,” he told Reuters, adding that the companies were targeting synergies by sharing their best practices in areas ranging from product design to production. “We look at ways to grow the company and keep employees happy,” he said, saying buying Hymer was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity despite expectations for a market correction. The recreational vehicle industry usually thrives in times of strong growth, while plunging in downturns as consumers cut down on non-essential spending. Hymer’s owners, who earlier this year put a stake in the company up for sale to seek funds to invest in North America and Asia, originally only planned to sell a minority share. They later opened up to the idea of selling a controlling stake, while also exploring a possible stock market listing. Hymer is expected to post earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of more than 250 million euros this year, and roughly 300 million in its fiscal 2019, people close to the matter have said. Thor and U.S. peer Winnebago WGO.N trade at less than 7 times their expected EBITDA, while French peer Trigano TRIA.PA trades at roughly 9 times. Erwin Hymer Group, which traces its roots to a business founded by wheelwright and coachbuilder Alfons Hymer in southern Germany in 1923, generated revenues of more than 2.5 billion euros based on production of 62,000 vehicles in the year to August 2018. It has a 20 percent share of the European market. German rival Knaus Tabbert canceled its stock market plans in April. JP Morgan and Barclays advised Thor on the deal, which it will partly finance by debt. Hymer worked with Macquarie."

-45.16902382467458," Thor emerges as leading bidder for caravan maker Hymer: sources FRANKFURT (Reuters) - U.S.-based recreational vehicle maker Thor Industries has emerged as the leading bidder for German family-owned peer Erwin Hymer Group in a deal valuing the company at more than 2 billion euros ($2.34 billion), people close to the matter said. Talks with Thor are advancing, but not yet exclusive, the people said. They added that the negotiations could still fall apart and Hymer’s owners could instead opt for an initial public offering. The offer of Thor - which would be able to reap synergies through a combination of its own business with Hymer - exceeded that of runner-up Centerbridge, a private equity group, one of the people said, adding that a decision is expected this month. Hymer, Thor and Centerbridge all declined to comment. Hymer’s owners, which initially put a stake in the company on the block seeking funds for Hymer to invest in North America and Asia, originally only planned to divest a minority, but have opened up to the idea of selling control. Last month, they mandated Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank and Citi as so called global coordinators of a potential initial public offering, with Macquarie acting as so called IPO advisor. Hymer is expected to post earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of more than 250 million euros this year, and of roughly 300 million in 2019. Thor and U.S. peer Winnebago trade at less than 7 times their expected EBITDA, while French peer Trigano trades at roughly 9 times. ($1 = 0.8565 euros)"
