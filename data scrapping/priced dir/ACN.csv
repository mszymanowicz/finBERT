12.34631856095215," Accenture to extend home working in Italy beyond COVID emergency MILAN, Jan 18 (Reuters) - Consulting and outsourcing services provider Accenture Plc said on Monday it would extend home working for its employees in Italy beyond the coronavirus emergency. The pandemic has caused a rapid shift in working habits worldwide, with many major companies repeatedly extending the home working policies put in place last year as infections show no sign of abating and both workers and employers experience benefits. Accenture’s 17,000 Italy-based workers will be able to work remotely three days a week, up from two pre-pandemic, it said in a statement, rising to five in case of special health needs. Currently 98% of its workforce is working from home, although staff have been able to do so to some degree since 2009, the group added. “For years we’ve been moving towards a more elastic and digital business environment and these past months have shown us how (this) can become a new standard,” Head of Human Resources in Italy Anna Nozza said. With this shift in mind, Accenture said it would start rethinking the layout of its offices and press on with its 2019 plan of refurbishing its spaces in Italy, at a total investment of 360 million euros ($434.41 million). Last week Unilever said office workers would be largely working from home during the first three months of the year and would then move to a hybrid model splitting their time between the office and home."

4.8174736541403576," Two local firms win gold in India's first LGBT+ work equality index NEW DELHI (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Two Indian firms, the Godrej Group and Hindustan Unilever, were named top employers for LGBT+ people on Thursday, in the country’s first workplace equality index, launched two years after it decriminalised gay sex. The other 19 gold award winners - with LGBT+ inclusive policies such as gender neutral bathrooms and health insurance for same-sex partners - were all international firms, including tech giant Microsoft and services company Accenture. Hindustan Unilever is the Indian subsidiary of the British consumer giant. “We are all in early stages of the inclusion journey in India,” said Parmesh Shahani, head of Godrej India Culture Lab, which hosts events to encourage diverse thinking, and is part of the conglomerate, which includes chemicals and property firms. “I am happy that so many companies are coming together to go on this journey together, learn from each other and share best practices with each other, so that we may all push each other to do more,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. In the index of 52 award-winning companies, 67% were international, 17% were Indian and the remainder chose to remain anonymous. India’s Tata Steel was one of the four Indian silver award winners, winning praise for its decision to rename “paternity leave” as “newborn parent leave”, which it offers to same-sex, trans and single male parents. The index - by British LGBT+ advocacy group Stonewall, India’s LGBT+ rights Keshav Suri Foundation and LGBT+ inclusion consultancy Pride Circle - came after the country’s top court scrapped a colonial-era ban on gay sex in 2018. The verdict not only allowed a nascent gay culture to come into the open, but also saw large Indian companies rush to offer LGBT+ benefits and workplace support such as leave for sex reassignment surgeries and sensitising employees. Research suggests firms that promote LGBT+ equality in the workplace tend to also have improved employee recruitment and retention, better consumer perceptions and higher profitability and productivity. Dilip Chenoy, secretary general of the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry, urged more domestic companies to participate in the index next year, saying it would help “move the needle towards diversity and inclusion”. “Such inclusion is not necessarily from a humanitarian sense, but it also makes immense business sense,” said Chenoy. “We need to make acceptable work environments where all employees feel respected, valued and involved irrespective of who they are.”"
2.1326023922023136," Apax-led consortium drops out of auction for Italy's Cedacri: sources LONDON/MILAN (Reuters) - A consortium of buyout fund Apax and digital services firm Reply has dropped out of the auction process for Italian banking software firm Cedacri, two sources told Reuters, leaving three bidders vying for control of the 44-year old business. IT consultancy Accenture and Italian IT services provider Engineering, backed by Bain Capital, submitted rival bids for Cedacri ahead of a mid-November deadline and have progressed to the second stage of the auction, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity as the matter is private. Dublin-based software and financial-data provider ION, led by Italian businessman Andrea Pignataro, is the third bidder left in the process, the sources said. The company, which provides anything from banking solutions, cloud services, big data and advanced analytics to over 70 banks, has been valued at more than 1 billion euros ($1.19 billion), representing a multiple in excess of 10 times its core earnings of about 100 million euros, the sources said. Cedacri and the bidders declined to comment. Discussions with Accenture, Engineering and ION are expected to gain momentum in the coming weeks, the sources said, as when bidders will be able to perform due diligence on the business, based in the northern Italian town of Parma. Private equity fund Apax had teamed up with Reply to provide industry expertise but its bid failed to progress, the sources said. Cedacri, which is advised by Deutsche Bank, aims to wrap up the process before the end of the year but a deadline for final offers has yet to be set and the negotiations may slip into January, the sources said. The company, led by boss Corrado Sciolla, is backed by Italian state-backed fund FSI, with a 27% stake, and by another 14 financial institutions including Unipol and Banca Mediolanum. Its investors hope to take advantage of whopping valuations for fintech assets and could receive binding offers valuing the company at between 1 and 1.5 billion euros, the sources said."

19.21394183056413," Banks at risk of losing billions of dollars in fee-based revenues: study NEW YORK (Reuters) - Major banks are at risk of losing billions of dollars of fee-based retail revenue as they face increased regulatory pressure and growing competition from new entrants offering no-fee services, Accenture Plc ACN.N said on Wednesday. Revenues derived by banks across 12 markets globally through overdraft fees or other charges for services like cross-border payments and foreign transactions will erode on average by 5% over the next three to five years, it said in a study. The research is based on quantitative analysis of banks’ revenue pools in 12 countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, Australia and Hong Kong and a survey of nearly 15,000 bank customers. It comes as tech-savvy start-ups seek to secure market share from big banks by offering a wide range of financial services, including checking accounts and international money transfers with lower or no fees. In the United States, for example, digital bank Chime offers fee-free overdrafts for up to $100, while London-based Revolut allows users to transfer money abroad at the interbank exchange rate. “These players are acting as a catalyst to force the industry to change,” said Alan McIntyre, global head of Accenture’s banking practice. Banks will not be able to be as reliant on non-transparent fee-based revenues as they have been doing in the past, he added. The report also said banks’ revenues may shrink because regulators are starting to mandate simpler fee structures to protect consumers. The study suggests that banks make use of technology such as artificial intelligence and predictive analytics to gain more of their customers’ trust and capture more revenue growth. For example, banks could use predictive analytics to provide advice on which payment option would generate more rewards, it said. More than half of the consumers surveyed said they would pay fees for relevant add-on services from their bank."

New bookings at the company, which gets about half of its revenue from outside the United States, were $10.6 billion, down from $11.7 billion in the year ago quarter, due to a 4% hit from a stronger dollar. “We suspect bookings will be back in the spotlight despite sound reported results,” Darrin Peller, an analyst from Wolfe Research said.

15.867612819153868," Accenture revenue forecast falls short, shares slip (Reuters) - Accenture Plc ACN.N forecast second-quarter revenue below analysts' estimates and said concerns about slowing global growth continue to persist, sending its shares down more than 5 percent. The consulting and outsourcing services provider, which gets about half of its revenue from outside the United States, said its revenue forecast included a hit from a stronger dollar. Chief Executive Officer Pierre Nanterme also flagged macro-economic uncertainties and said the traditional IT services model was under pressure, but added that clients were reallocating money to digital and cloud services. Strong growth in digital, cloud and security-related services business, which the company calls it “the New”, helped Accenture beat first-quarter revenue and profit estimates. “The shares are down primarily on more macro concerns with doubts around what happens to revenue growth rate in the next months if there is a slowdown,” said Harshita Rawat from Bernstein. “The quarter itself was fine, in line, but obviously with Accenture the bar was also very high.” The Dublin-based company forecast of $10.10 billion to $10.40 billion, including a 4 percent hit from foreign exchange. At the midpoint of that range, the estimate was below the average analysts’ expectation of $10.32 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Accenture has shifted its focus to offering digital and cloud services, which include everything from managing clients’ social media marketing strategies to helping them move to the cloud, as the IT services industry struggles with falling margins.

-6.154804662108664," Fintech making inroads, but U.S. bank revenues little changed: report NEW YORK (Reuters) - Financial technology startups and other new entrants are making inroads in the U.S. banking market, but have yet to capture a threatening share of bank revenues, according to research published by Accenture Plc ACN.N on Wednesday. Around 19 percent of financial institutions in the U.S. are new entrants, such as challenger banks, non-bank payments institutions and big tech companies, according to the report. Yet they have amassed only 3.5 percent of the total $1.04 trillion in banking and payment revenues so-far, Accenture found. In the UK, new entrants have made a larger dent, having captured 14 percent of the total €206 billion ($238.45 billion)in industry revenues, with the majority going to non-bank payments companies, according to the report. Accenture assessed more than 20,000 banking and payments institutions across seven markets around the world to determine the level of change that digital technologies have brought about in banking. Since the financial downturn, a growing number of companies across the world have sought to position themselves as cheaper and more user-friendly alternatives to banks by making better use of new technology. Banking and payments institutions have decreased by nearly 20 percent from 2005 to 2017. Still, one in six current institutions is what Accenture considers a new entrant, or companies that have entered the market since 2005. Their impact has varied by geography. Tougher regulations and greater dominance of large banks have made the U.S. a more difficult market for new entrants in areas excluding payments, Alan McIntyre, head of Accenture’s global banking practice, said in an interview. “You still have a very robust banking market in the US,” McIntyre said. More than half of new current accounts opened in the United States have been captured by three large banks, which have had more money to invest in digital than smaller regional players, he added. In the UK the situation has been different, thanks in part to a push from regulators aimed at fostering greater competition in the financial sector and diminishing the dominance of large banks. New entrants account for 63 percent of financial players in the UK, according to the report. The report also found new entrants are taking over one third of new revenue, pointing to their potential to pose a greater competitive threat going forward. In Europe, including the UK, 20 percent of banking and payments institutions are new entrants and have captured nearly 7 percent of total banking revenues, according to the report."
-16.675493893708175," Accenture profit forecast falls short of estimates, shares slip (Reuters) - Accenture Plc's ACN.N profit forecast for the year fell short of estimates, overshadowing better-than-expected fourth-quarter revenue and profit and sending its shares down about 2 percent. The consulting and outsourcing services provider said the forecast assumes impact from a stronger dollar, and that the possibility of a “hard” Brexit and the ongoing trade war could impact its business. The company said it expects full-year profit between $6.98 per share and $7.25 per share, below the average estimate of $7.28 per share. It also said it expects full-year revenue growth between 5 percent and 8 percent in local currency. “Accenture reported solid numbers, driven by growth across all its segments. They provided FY19 guidance of 5-8 percent local currency revenue growth; and commented that the macro is incrementally more volatile, primarily due to disputes around global trade and the potential for a hard Brexit,” Arvind Ramnani, analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets said. Like its peers, Accenture has been focusing on cloud computing, cyber-security and analytics to reduce its reliance on IT services, where margins are falling as clients demand more work for less money. Accenture has spent about $3.4 billion over the last three years — nearly half of it in fiscal 2017 — on some 70 acquisitions, to boost its digital and cloud services in order to compete better with Cognizant CTSH.O and IBM IBM.N. Much of the company’s recent growth has been driven by these services, which include everything from managing clients’ social media marketing strategies to helping them move operations to the cloud. Revenue from its digital, cloud and security-related services, which the company terms as “the New”, made up more than 60 percent of total revenue. Net income attributable to the company rose to $1.03 billion, or $1.58 per share, from $932.5 million, or $1.48 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Aug. 31, a year earlier. Accenture’s profit beat the average analyst estimate of $1.56 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net revenue rose to $10.15 billion, ahead of estimates of $10.01 billion. The company also raised its semi-annual cash dividend by 10 percent to $1.46 and said its board had approved an additional share repurchase program of $5 billion. Accenture’s shares were down 2 pct at $169.29 in early trading."

3.46504368221108," Accenture's digital investments drive quarterly beat (Reuters) - Accenture Plc’s third-quarter revenue and profit came in above Wall Street estimates on Thursday as the consulting and outsourcing services provider benefited from its plan to boost investments in digital and cloud services. Shares of the company, which also raised its full year adjusted profit forecast, were up about 5 percent at $162.87 in early trading. Revenue from its digital, cloud and security-related services, which the company terms as “the New”, made up about 60 percent of total revenue for the first time. Accenture Chief Executive Officer Pierre Nanterme said that “the New” has now become the core of company’s business. “I would say all our New babies have the potential to grow successfully for many years,” Nanterme said on a conference call. The Dublin, Ireland-based company has spent more than $3 billion over the last three years on some 70 acquisitions to boost its digital and cloud services in order to compete better with Cognizant and IBM. It has made investments of over $450 million in acquisitions this year. Accenture’s third-quarter beat was “driven by very strong broad-based revenue growth and healthy operating margin”, Cowen & Co analyst Bryan Bergin said. Evercore ISI analyst David Togut pointed to continued market share gains in North America and Europe, where revenue grew 11 percent and 22 percent respectively. Evercore raised its PT on Accenture by $2 to $186 after the results. The company raised its forecast for full year adjusted earnings per share to between $6.66 and $6.71, from between $6.61 to $6.70. Accenture forecast current-quarter revenue between $9.8 billion and $10.05 billion, the midpoint of which was slightly below average analyst estimate of $10.01 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income attributable to the company rose to $1.04 billion in the quarter ended May 31 from $669.5 million a year earlier. It reported earnings of $1.60 per share, compared with $1.05 a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned $1.79 per share, above analysts’ estimates of $1.72 per share.
