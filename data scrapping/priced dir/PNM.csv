-1.999355265544249," Iberdrola, PNM to create $20 billion U.S. clean powerhouse MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's Iberdrola IBE.MC announced a deal worth $8.3 billion including debt on Wednesday, adding PNM Resources PNM.N to its Avangrid AGR.N business to create the third-largest U.S. renewable energy operator. Absorbing PNM into Avangrid will create an operator present in 24 states, Iberdrola said, and bring together firms with a combined market value topping $20 billion. Reuters reported on Tuesday that the deal was being discussed. PNM’s board unanimously approved the $4.3 billion offer to its shareholders of $50.3 per share, the filing said. Iberdrola expects the deal to close in 2021 and start boosting financial results from the first year. Green energy targets and increasing investor interest in protecting the environment have buoyed Iberdrola and other renewables-focused utilities. The pandemic has also seen U.S. utilities look harder at consolidation to cut costs and spur investment. Active in New Mexico and Texas, PNM gives Avangrid a route to expand its regulated business beyond the U.S. northeast. PNM could also benefit from Avangrid’s renewables experience as it works to cut emissions. A plan has now been approved to close its coal-fired San Juan plant in 2022, Iberdrola said. Iberdrola said the merged company would have assets worth $40 billion, generate core earnings of around $2.5 billion and net profit of $850 million. This is Iberdrola’s eighth deal this year as part of a 10 billion euro ($11.85 billion) investment drive of which it has already spent more than 6.6 billion euros. It has shopped for assets in France, Australia and Japan. CEO Ignacio Galan said his strategy consisted of: “Friendly transactions, focused on regulated businesses and renewable energy, in countries with good credit ratings and legal and regulatory stability, offering opportunities for future growth”. Separately on Wednesday, Iberdrola reported nine-month net profit growth of 4.7% and said it still expected growth of mid to high-single digit in 2020. Iberdrola’s Madrid-listed shares were down around 0.5% against a broader market 0.14% lower at 0753 GMT."
6.869714103770624," Exclusive: Iberdrola's Avangrid in talks to buy U.S. utility PNM Resources - sources (Reuters) - Avangrid Inc AGR.N, the U.S. power utility that is controlled by Spain's Iberdrola SA IBE.MC, is in talks to acquire PNM Resources Inc PNM.N, a peer active in New Mexico and Texas that is worth more than $6 billion, including debt, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. The deal would expand Avangrid’s regulated business beyond its U.S. northeastern footprint. It would also accelerate PNM’s transition to clean energy, given Avangrid’s sizeable renewable energy portfolio. There is no certainty that the negotiations will lead to a deal, the sources said, requesting anonymity because the matter is confidential. Spokespeople for Avangrid and PNM Resources did not respond to requests for comment. Efforts among U.S. utilities to consolidate are picking up, amid pressure to slash costs and invest in infrastructure improvements and cleaner forms of electricity generation. Duke Energy Corp DUK.N rebuffed a takeover approach from NextEra Energy Inc NEE.N last month, a deal which would have created a $200 billion behemoth with operations across the U.S. Southeast and Midwest. Iberdrola owns a 81.6% stake in Avangrid. The Orange, Connecticut-based company, with a market capitalization of $16.7 billion, is split into two businesses -- a regulated utility serving more than 3.3 million customers in New York and New England, and a division which owns and operates renewable power generation assets across the United States. Avangrid’s experience in clean energy could prove valuable to PNM, as it embarks on a plan it announced in July to phase out coal from its power generation mix by 2031 and achieve emissions-free energy by 2040. Iberdrola has said it wants to expand its renewable capacity in the United States by about 50 percent over four years as part of its global plan to reduce carbon emissions."
