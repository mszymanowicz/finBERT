1.116769195258989," Singapore's GIC teams up with Chinese asset manager for Philips' home appliances bid -sources Singapore's sovereign wealth fund GIC has teamed up with Chinese asset manager CDH Investments to submit a joint offer for the $3.6 billion home appliance business of Philips (PHG.AS), two sources told Reuters. The duo is facing competition from Asia-focused private equity firm Hillhouse Capital and a consortium of Citic Capital, Sequoia and TCL Capital, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Philips has put pressure on the bidders to finalise their binding offers by the end of March and raised the prospect of ditching the sale and pursuing an alternative listing of the business, which produces coffee machines, vacuum cleaners and air fryers. Philips declined to comment while none of the bidders were immediately available out of business hours. The sale is a central part of Philips' transformation into a health technology business focused entirely on hospital equipment and personal health products. Once a sprawling conglomerate, the Amsterdam-based company has narrowed its focus in recent years, spinning off the lighting and consumer electronics divisions for which it was previously best known. Philips' home appliance unit is valued at about 3 billion euros ($3.64 billion) and appeals to Asian bidders since the bulk of its manufacturing operations takes place in China, the sources said. The Dutch technology giant kicked off the auction process last year and although it wants to wrap it up by the end of the first quarter, the sources said some of the bidders may face delays in completing due diligence and securing financing. CDH is, however, determined to snap up the unit and has teamed up with GIC which already owns stakes in Western companies including British insurer Rothesay Life and Italian cosmetics firm Intercos, one of the sources said. In the event of delays Philips will gauge appetite for an initial public offering (IPO) of the business and has hired Lazard (LAZ.N) to start the preparation work for a possible float on an Asian exchange, a third source said. ""The IPO project remains at an early stage. It will gain traction if Chinese bidders can't get their act together,"" he said. ($1 = 0.8241 euros)"
3.1047122359657693," Philips sees good start to 2021 as pandemic-led demand continues AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Dutch health technology company Philips on Monday said it expected a good start to 2021 as demand for the hospital equipment needed to treat COVID-19 patients remained strong. Philips said both core earnings and comparable sales had increased 7% in the last three months of 2020, driven by a 24% jump in sales at its Connected Care division, which supplies respiratory machines and monitoring and software platforms that allow remote care. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and amortisation (EBITA) rose to 1.14 billion euros ($1.39 billion) in the October-December period, on 6 billion euros of sales. That continues the strong recovery underway in the previous quarter, when the initial shock of the pandemic waned and hospitals rushed to buy equipment to treat the respiratory disease. However, a fresh wave of global infections is leading hospitals to delay elective procedures and the installation of new equipment in other areas again, Chief Executive Frans van Houten said. He remained upbeat for 2021 though, saying orders were only pushed back, and not cancelled. “Orders are still coming in, it’s just a matter of timing when that will turn into revenue. We expect a good start of the year”, he told reporters. Philips shares rose 3% in early trading in Amsterdam, as ING analysts called the results a “small beat” versus expectations. Total new orders increased 7% in the last three months of 2020, taking order growth for the year up to 9%. “We continued to gain market share in our healthcare businesses, and ended the year with a strong order book,” Van Houten said. Philips confirmed its outlook for “low-single-digit comparable sales growth” in 2021, as demand for COVID-19 equipment is expected to cool down. The first half of 2021 is expected to be relatively strong, Van Houten said, due to the comparison with the first months of last year when hospitals delayed investments and demand for consumer products was crippled as the virus took hold.

1.8737438194230405," Philips buys U.S. cardiac care company BioTelemetry in $2.8 billion deal AMSTERDAM (Reuters) -Dutch health technology company Philips is set to buy U.S. cardiac diagnostics and monitoring firm BioTelemetry in a $2.8 billion deal that will strengthen its offering of remote care products. Philips said on Friday it would pay $72 per outstanding BioTelemetry share in cash, in an offer supported by the U.S. company’s board at a 16.5% premium to the stock’s closing price on Thursday. Philips shares gained 2% in early trading, making them one of the biggest risers on Amsterdam’s blue chip AEX-index. BioTelemetry, which has around 1,900 employees, primarily focuses on the diagnosis and remote monitoring of heart rhythm disorders, a business that represented 85% of its $439 million sales last year. It will become part of Philips’ connected care business, which offers a range of platforms and devices that allow patients to stay at home while being monitored. Philips banks on rising life expectancy and associated chronic diseases to make this business a pillar for future growth. This year the COVID-19 pandemic led to a surge in demand for remote monitoring solutions. “We have always been very optimistic about connected care,” Chief Executive Frans van Houten told reporters. “With COVID we have seen an acceleration of the demand and we think this acquisition fits perfectly in this era where remote patient monitoring will become ever more important.” Once a sprawling conglomerate, Philips has become purely focused on healthcare after spinning off its lighting and consumer electronics divisions in recent years. Philips said BioTelemetry was expected to deliver double-digit growth and improve its adjusted earnings before interest, tax and amortisation (EBITA) margin to more than 20% by 2025. The company, which expects to complete the purchase in the first quarter of 2021, said the acquisition would have boost its own sales growth and profit margin from next year."

In an update ahead of its annual investors day, the company predicted comparable sales growth of up to 5% for the 2021-2023 period, while it said revenue was expected to drop 13-13.5% this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Signify, which was spun off from Philips in 2016, saw sales decline for years as customers moved from conventional lights to LED, but expects the worst of that downturn is over. “Looking ahead, we expect the headwinds facing our industry from the transition to LED to abate over the coming years”, Chief Executive Officer Eric Rondolat said. The company said it expected its adjusted EBITA margin to improve to between 11% and 13% by 2023. The profit margin is expected to be between 10.2% and 10.6% this year, after a slight improvement to 10.4% in 2019. Signify had declined in October to give an outlook for 2020, as its clients were reluctant to rebuild inventory of lamps and lighting fixtures amid the pandemic."
10.243811345257605," Lufthansa hires finance head from chocolate maker Barry Callebaut (This story from November 11 corrects surname of new CFO throughout, first name of former CFO in paragraph 6) BERLIN (Reuters) - Loss-making German airline Lufthansa said on Wednesday it would revive the role of finance chief and had hired Remco Steenbergen from Swiss chocolate maker Barry Callebaut to fill the post. Steenbergen, a 52-year-old Dutchman who has managed Barry Callebaut’s finances since March 2018, will be new to the aviation industry when he starts at Lufthansa in January. He previously worked for consultancy KPMG and technology group Philips in Europe, Asia and the United States. Lufthansa faces its deepest crisis ever as a result of the coronavirus crisis, surviving on a 9 billion euro ($11 billion) state aid package. The airline posted a 2 billion euros net loss in the third quarter as is using less than a quarter of its capacity, with plans to reduce 22,000 full-time jobs. It said in April that it would share the tasks of former finance chief Ulrik Svensson across its management board after he resigned for health reasons. Lufthansa group chief executive Carsten Spohr has lately taken on the function. “Especially now, when the pandemic is having such serious consequences for air travel, an internationally experienced and well-respected CFO is more important than ever for Lufthansa Group,” supervisory board chief Karl-Ludwig Kley said. “Not only to overcome the current crisis but also for the coming years, when we have to – and want to – pay back government stabilization funds.” Steenbergen has agreed to a three-year contract, said Lufthansa, which did not give details of his pay. EU rules mean Lufthansa managers are not allowed to receive any bonuses until at least 75% of the state aid has been repaid."
10.343434961639371," Philips growth spurred by COVID-19 demand and distant care AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Health technology company Philips saw sales and profits jump in the third quarter, as the COVID-19 pandemic spurred demand for hospital equipment needed to help patients battling the disease. Amsterdam-based Philips on Monday said comparable sales rose 10% to 4.98 billion euros ($5.8 billion) in the July-September period, while core profits improved by almost a third to 769 million euros. Profits and sales easily beat analysts’ expectations, taking Philips shares up 2.9% at 0800 GMT in Amsterdam. Growth was mainly driven by a 42% increase in sales at the connected care division, which makes monitoring and respiratory care devices used to treat COVID-19 patients and other appliances which allow carers to work remotely. Like competitors such as Germany’s Siemens Healthineers, Philips’ results were hit hard in the first half of 2020, as the pandemic caused hospitals to delay the installation of new equipment and crippled demand for consumer products. But after the first shock of the coronavirus outbreak, Philips began to see a structural change at hospitals, Chief Executive Frans van Houten said, as they increased demand for devices that allow for remote patient monitoring. These range from appliances for teleconsults to platforms for radiologists to diagnose patients while working from home and for monitoring patients on intensive care units without having to be by their side. “There is a structural higher demand for the healthcare informatics that Philips has already invested in for several years and now we see the validation of that strategy”, the CEO said. This structural shift will be one of the main drivers for future growth, Van Houten said, as Philips updated its targets for the years to come. Philips said it expected average sales growth of 5% to 6% per year between 2021 and 2025, with the adjusted EBITA margin improving by 60 to 80 basis points each year. The company’s profit margin jumped to 15.4% in the third quarter, up from 12.4% a year earlier, and is now expected to reach the “high teens” by 2025, it said. For 2021, however, Philips predicted “low-single-digit growth”, as demand for COVID-19 equipment is expected to cool down. Philips cut its outlook for 2020 in August, after the U.S. Department of Health cancelled most of an order for 43,000 ventilators. The company on Monday maintained its outlook for moderate sales growth and a stable EBITA margin for the whole of this year. ($1 = 0.8540 euros)"
8.485993619318686," U.S. scraps Philips ventilator order in 2020 earnings blow AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Philips PHG.AS said the U.S. Department of Health had cancelled most of an order for 43,000 ventilators, leading the Dutch medical equipment maker to cut its 2020 earnings outlook. The termination follows a July report by the U.S. Congress House Subcommittee on Economic and Consumer Policy that found the White House had overpaid Philips by at least $500 million. Philips denied any profiteering on ventilators. Philips was one of several firms contracted by the U.S. to supply 187,000 ventilators to the strategic national stockpile to treat patients affected by COVID-19. It expanded capacity in Pennsylvania and California to meet sudden demand but said in a statement on Monday that it will now deliver just 12,300 hospital ventilators by the end of the year to the U.S. Department of Health and Human services. A spokesman said he expected Philips will find other buyers for the 30,700 excess ventilators. Shares in Philips, which are down 4.3% in the year to date, dipped 0.6% to 40.84 euros. “We continue to expect to return to growth and improved profitability in the second half of the year, starting in the third quarter,” Philips chief executive Frans van Houten said. Philips had said in July that the surge in orders for medical equipment would enable it to achieve an “adjusted EBITA (earnings before interest, taxes, and amortisation) margin improvement” this year. But it said on Monday it expects “to deliver modest comparable sales growth with an adjusted EBITA margin of around the level of last year”. Philips’ core earnings fell almost a quarter in April-June to 418 million euros ($497.25 million) as sales dropped 6% to 4.4 billion euros. ING, which rates Philips shares “hold”, said in a note the news was a slight negative as analysts were already expecting flat margins this year."

The Dutch company, which makes products ranging from electrical toothbrushes to hospital equipment, said it will now deliver just 12,300 hospital ventilators by the end of the year. Philips was one of several companies contracted by the U.S. to supply more than 187,000 ventilators to the strategic national stockpile to help treat patients during the coronavirus pandemic. The company said it had been informed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) of the partial termination of the contract. Philips will not ship a remaining 30,700 ventilators, it said in a statement. Orders for ventilators and other medical equipment resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak had been expected to lift Philips’ performance in 2020. “The reduction in our ventilator deliveries to HHS will obviously impact Philips’ financial performance, but we continue to expect to return to growth and improved profitability in the second half of the year, starting in the third quarter,” Frans van Houten, Philips chief executive, said.

-10.144923231386976," Philips denies profiteering on ventilators AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Dutch healthcare equipment company Philips PHG.AS did not raise the price of its ventilators to maximise profit from sales during the coronavirus crisis, it said on Friday in response to a U.S. Congress report here. The U.S. Congress House Subcommitte on Economic and Consumer policy had said earlier in the day that the White House had overpaid Philips by at least $500 million in a deal struck during the first peak of coronavirus infections. The committee said the government had agreed to pay almost five times the price for hospital ventilators compared with its previous deal for similar equipment from Philips. “I would like to make clear that on no occasion has Philips raised prices to benefit from the crisis situation,” Chief Executive Frans van Houten said in a statement. The committee also said that the White House had ignored Philips’ failure to deliver the thousands of ventilators it had promised by mid-2019 under the earlier agreement. “Had the Trump administration held Philips to the terms of the Obama-era contract, the country would have had 10,000 ventilators that it needed when the coronavirus crisis struck”, the committee said. Philips in April said its deal with the White House would enable it to deliver the U.S. government 43,000 hospital ventilators, essential for the treatment of patients struggling with COVID-19, throughout the rest of the year for a total sum of $647 million. Philips could not be reached for further comment."

-1.8618046190541298," Surging demand for medical equipment puts Philips on course for second-half recovery AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Electrical equipment maker Philips said a recent surge in orders for scanners and other medical equipment should enable group sales and margins to rebound over the next six months from a slump in the second quarter. The Dutch company, which makes products ranging from electrical toothbrushes to high-end hospital equipment, said its core earnings fell by almost a quarter in April-June to 418 million euros as sales dropped 6% to 4.4 billion euros, hit by the impact on demand of the coronavirus pandemic. The results, however, were better than analysts had expected. While the pandemic had hit demand for some products in the second quarter, Philips said the virus had also spurred a 27% increase in new orders as hospitals rushed to buy CT scanners, ventilators and monitoring equipment needed to help patients battling the respiratory disease. Shares in the company were up 4.3% in late morning trade making them the only notable winner on Amsterdam’s blue chip AEX index. A company-compiled poll of analysts had predicted second-quarter adjusted EBITA would drop to 344 million euros, on sales of 4.34 billion euros. “For the full year 2020 we continue to aim for a modest comparable sales growth and adjusted EBITA margin improvement,” Chief Executive Frans van Houten told a media call. The surge in new orders in the second quarter followed on from a 23% rise in orders in the first quarter, reflecting strong demand for medical equipment during the pandemic. In the second quarter of last year, the group’s total new orders rose by just 8%. Longer term, van Houten said the pandemic had led hospitals to look at ways to better deal with highly infectious diseases. This includes the need for devices that enable careworkers to remotely monitor patients, which are at the heart of Philips’ strategy to make better use of patient data and internet technology to enable patients to remain at home, he said. “Hospitals want to create a more resilient infrastructure where patients that are infected can be treated in a different way and elective procedures can continue”, Van Houten said. “That bodes well for Philips, also beyond 2020.” Philips shares have in recent months recovered to levels seen at the end of 2019, after losing over a third of their value in the first quarter of this year. “Philips reported a much better than expected second quarter update”, ING analyst Marc Hesselink said, adding that he expected Philips to meet its growth outlook for the year. Van Houten said the results were helped by a stronger than anticipated rebound in consumer demand in Europe, but the recovery in China had stagnated after an initial surge when lockdowns were eased."

21.64370032139985," Philips says modest growth possible, despite virus disruption AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Sales and profit margins at Dutch health technology company Philips PHG.AS could still rise this year, provided the coronavirus pandemic eases in the coming months and hospitals are able to restart elective operations, it said on Monday. The optimism contrasts with the gloom engulfing much of the corporate world as lockdowns to contain the pandemic hammer business, and partly reflects strong orders for Philips’ medical ventilators used for treating the sickest coronavirus patients. The electric toothbrush to hospital scanners maker scrapped its previous 2020 forecasts for 4-6% comparable sales growth and a 100 basis point improvement in operating profit margin, as the disruption from the health crisis hit first-quarter results and it warned the second quarter could be even worse. However, Chief Executive Frans van Houten said “modest” growth in sales and margins was still possible this year if the crisis eases in the months ahead, allowing hospitals to restart elective procedures and consumer demand to recover. As one of the first European companies to report first-quarter results, Philips’ comments could raise investors’ hopes that others will also see a quick recovery. The novel coronavirus disease COVID-19 has increased global demand for Philips’ ventilators and other hospital equipment, leading to a 23% rise in orders in the first three months of the year as the company promised to ramp up production. But that has been more than offset by a plunge in demand for personal care products, such as toothbrushes and shavers. Underlying earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (EBITA) dropped 33% from a year earlier in the first quarter to 244 million euros ($265 million), while comparable sales declined 2% to 4.15 billion euros. “Order intake was very strong”, ING analyst Marc Hesselink said. “But Q1 seems significantly below on profitability.” Philips shares traded up 4.7% in Amsterdam at 0755 GMT, limiting their loss since the start of the year to around 10%. Van Houten forecast a “steep” revenue drop for personal care products in the second quarter and a “sizable high single-digit” decline for a large part of its hospital equipment business. But developments in China provided some grounds for optimism about the second half of the year, he added. “In China, consumer demand was down 80% in February, but we saw online sales gradually recover in March. Also hospitals which were very focused on pandemic priorities restarted elective procedures, such as cardiovascular interventions. “The rest of the world is, let’s say, a quarter behind.

20.335166040006122," GM, Philips to supply 73,000 U.S. ventilators in $1.1 billion effort WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Health and Human Services Department (HHS) on Wednesday awarded two contracts worth more than $1 billion to make ventilators needed to treat severely sick coronavirus patients and plans to announce five additional contracts later this week. HHS awarded automaker General Motors Co GM.N a contract for $489 million to produce 30,000 ventilators, while it also announced a $646.7 million contract given to Dutch health technology company Philips PHG.AS to produce 43,000 ventilators by year end, including 2,500 ventilators by the end of May. GM will work with Ventec Life Systems to deliver the 30,000 ventilators under the contract to the U.S. government by the end of August, with deliveries of the first 6,132 machines to occur by June 1. GM is set to begin production in Indiana next week. Last week, U.S. President Donald Trump issued an order under the Defense Production Act to facilitate the supply of materials to produce ventilators to Philips, General Electric Co GE.N, Hill-Rom Holdings Inc HRC.N, Medtronic Plc MDT.N, ResMed Inc RMD.N and Vyaire Medical Inc. HHS plans to announce contracts with those firms later this week, the agency said. Trump said the order would help the firms “overcome obstacles in the supply chain that threaten the rapid production of ventilators.” GM “will fulfill the government contract and (has) the capacity to supply more if needed,” company spokesman Jim Cain said, adding the contract also includes “consumables and accessories (hoses, stands, etc.) to support each unit.” GM Vice President Gerald Johnson told Reuters last month the automaker is spending tens of millions of dollars on retooling costs as it produces the ventilators, and that if supplier retooling costs are included, total retooling costs were in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Last week, GM rival Ford also said it will produce 50,000 ventilators over the next 100 days at a plant in Michigan in cooperation with GE’s healthcare unit."

30.96645846373624," Philips warns protectionism could derail critical medical supplies AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Broad powers over U.S. factories brought in by President Donald Trump could fuel protectionism and jeopardize the supply of critical medical equipment to fight the coronavirus pandemic, Dutch health technology company Philips warned on Tuesday. Trump said on Friday he had put into action the U.S. Defense Production Act, a law dating back to the Korean War of the 1950s that grants him sweeping authority to expedite and expand the supply of resources from U.S. factories. That could include hospital ventilators which Philips makes in factories in California and Pennsylvania. ""We are worried"", Philips PHG.AS spokesman Steve Klink told Reuters on Tuesday, referring to the act. Amsterdam-based Philips said on Sunday it would increase production of critical medical supplies for the diagnosis and care of patients with the new coronavirus disease COVID-19. Most importantly, it said it would double its production of hospital ventilators in the coming weeks to help meet soaring global demand, and was aiming at a four-fold increase by the third quarter. All these ventilators, however, are produced in its two U.S. factories, which makes Philips’ promise to ship them to the regions where they are most needed vulnerable to interventions by the U.S. government. Such interventions could not only limit supply outside the United States, Klink said, but could also leave the country itself with less equipment than it would otherwise have - if retaliation in Europe or Asia squeezed the supply of critical parts. “We know we can meet our production promises”, Klink said. “But only if the entire supply chain cooperates. A respiratory device has many parts, which come from all over the world. Protectionism can have a detrimental effect, no matter if it happens at the end of the production line or somewhere in between.” In a tweet posted on Tuesday, Trump said the Defense Production Act was in full force, but had not been used yet. A few hours later, CNN reported the Trump administration was planning to procure 60,000 coronavirus test kits through the first use of the act. The Dutch ministry of foreign affairs said it was in talks with both Philips and the Trump administration on the matter, but declined further comment. Philips said it was optimistic its exports of ventilators would be unaffected, as Chief Executive Frans van Houten continued to be in talks with the U.S. government. “As long as we are in talks, we remain confident in a positive outcome.”"
40.910456200350524," Philips to ramp up production of ventilators in coronavirus fight AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Dutch health technology company Philips PHG.AS is to ramp up production of critical healthcare products to help diagnose and treat patients with the new coronavirus disease COVID-19. Philips said on Sunday that it aimed to double its production of hospital ventilators within the next eight weeks and to achieve a four-fold increase by the third quarter. “We currently make around a thousand ventilators per week and are looking to reach around 2,000 in the coming weeks,” Chief Executive Frans van Houten told Reuters. “We will continue to increase production, because we see an enormous demand.” Van Houten said he had been in contact with his main competitors, such as Draeger DRWG.DE and Medtronic MDT.N, who he said were also aiming to increase production. “Our increase alone will certainly not be enough,” he said. “But together, we hope to come towards meeting demand.” Van Houten said Philips also hopes to increase production of other equipment critical in the fight against COVID-19, such as vital signs monitors, diagnostic imaging systems and software solutions for hospitals to monitor and manage patients in intensive care units. For this, Philips expects to hire extra manufacturing staff as well as shifting current staff to the production lines where they are most needed. “But the most important part is to get suppliers to cooperate, to facilitate the ramp-up in production”, Van Houten said. Despite the increased demand for its critical healthcare equipment, Philips said it expected the coronavirus outbreak to harm its results in the first half of 2020. Philips had earlier already warned about the impact of the pandemic on first-quarter earnings because demand for its consumer products has waned and global supply chains have been severely disrupted."

-9.575581429748642," Philips bids farewell to home appliances to sharpen health focus AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Philips PHG.AS will complete its transformation to a health technology business with the sale of its domestic appliances division, which no longer fits with the company's range of hospital equipment and personal health products. Once a sprawling conglomerate, Amsterdam-based Philips has narrowed its focus in recent years, spinning off the lighting and consumer electronics divisions for which it was previously best known. Philips said on Tuesday it would carve out the domestic appliances business, which produces coffee machines, vacuum cleaners and airfryers and generated 2.3 billion euros ($2.6 billion) in sales last year, in the coming 12 to 18 months. “This business is not a strategic fit for our future as a health technology leader,” Chief Executive Officer Frans van Houten said. He added that all options remained open for the division, which he said had a double-digit profit margin that was “slightly less” than the average for Philips. ING analyst Marc Hesselink said a “quick and dirty” calculation valued the division at around 3 billion euros, assuming a 10% profit margin with a price tag of 12 times gross profit. “This was a, in our view, widely expected move...to focus even more on health tech”, he said. Philips shares fell 3% in Amsterdam, with analysts pointing to fourth-quarter results that missed expectations, and disappointing sales growth in all sectors. Comparable sales increased 3% to 6 billion euros from a year earlier, compared with an average forecast in a company poll of analysts for a 4.9% increase. Adjusted earnings before interest, tax and amortization (EBITA) rose 10% to 1.07 billion euros, also slightly below expectations. Philips reaffirmed its 2020 targets for a 100 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITA margin and a 4 to 6% increase in comparable sales, but said it expected a slow start to the year with growth likely to be dented by China’s efforts to contain a coronavirus outbreak. The company has around 8,000 employees in China, many of whom have been ordered by authorities to stay at home. Philips fell far short of a similar 100 basis point profit margin improvement goal in 2019, having warned in October that it would miss the target as the U.S.-China trade war forced it to shift production and seek new suppliers. The already struggling connected care business, which specializes in remote patient monitoring, was the hardest hit and Van Houten said that following a significant fall in margins, the division’s leader Carla Kriwet would leave the company and be replaced by Philips veteran Roy Jakobs. Philips expects rising life expectancy and associated chronic diseases to increase demand for devices that allow patients to be monitored at home, but sales at the connected care unit have in recent years lagged those of bigger divisions selling large medical equipment and personal care devices.

Wearable activity trackers have gained popularity among consumers seeking to track their physical activity and other health metrics. The January announcement also comes at a time when a number of people set new year resolutions. Representatives for Garmin, Ingram Micro, Maintek and Inventec Appliances could not be immediately reached for comment. Although the USITC agreed to launch an investigation, it said it “has not yet made any decision on the merits of the case” and would make its determination “at the earliest practicable time.”"

10.283613673441446," Philips third-quarter core profit rises 3% on strong demand AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Dutch health technology company Philips PHG.AS said on Monday its core earnings rose 2.6% in the third quarter to 583 million euros ($646.3 million) on strong global sales of its medical machines. Comparable revenue increased 6% to 4.7 billion euros, led by double-digit growth of hospital equipment sales in China, India and Latin America. Philips’ numbers were in line with preliminary results released earlier this month, when the company warned it would miss its 2019 profit margin target due to trade tariffs and poor results at its Connected Care arm.

17.704606861692472," Tariffs take toll on Philips margin goal in blow to shares AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Philips PHG.AS warned it will miss its 2019 profit margin target on Thursday due to trade tariffs and poor results at its Connected Care arm, wiping around 3 billion euros ($3.3 billion)off the Dutch healthcare technology group's market value. The trade war between the United States and China has forced Philips to shift production and to seek other suppliers for components in recent months to avoid punitive tariffs. But this has proved harder to achieve than earlier expected, while tariffs rose faster than previously announced, Chief Executive Frans van Houten told reporters. “Tariffs have gone up, definitions have become clearer”, Van Houten said, adding: “The impact has gone up, while mitigating actions have been delayed.” Philips shares were down 8% at 0820 GMT after the warning. Earlier this year, Philips said the trade war between Washington and Beijing was forcing it to move hundreds of millions of euros worth of production from the U.S. to China, and vice versa, to avoid tariffs. These mainly hurt Philips’ connected care business, which specializes in remote patient monitoring, for instance through software platforms and devices that allow doctors to share patient information. Sales of connected care were 3 billion euros ($3.3 billion) last year, on total group revenues of 18.1 billion euros. The connected care arm is more exposed to trade tariffs than Philips’ two larger businesses, which make hospital equipment such as medical scanners and personal health products such as toothbrushes, as it offers many more and smaller products. “This means we need a lot of small actions, which all add up”, Van Houten said. “In diagnosis & treatment we have fewer products, while in personal health the volumes are higher, so a single action there has greater effect on the whole.” Margins at the struggling Connected Care division not only dropped in the third quarter as tariffs hit, but also because factories lowered production to get rid of high inventories. Philips has repeatedly said rising life expectancy and associated chronic diseases would lead to growing demand for devices that allow patients to stay at home, while their data is monitored. But Van Houten last year also said demand for such products would remain modest in 2019. Philips now expects its adjusted EBITA margin to only improve by 10 to 20 basis points this year, well off its previous 100 basis point goal. “Based on this profit warning we expect 2019 adjusted EBITA to come down by low-to-mid-single digit”, ING analyst Marc Hesselink said. Philips did stick to its target of improving comparable sales by 4% to 6% this year, as Van Houten said he continued to see good growth in all his businesses.

-2.8870820704260036," Exclusive: Philips, under investigation in U.S. and Brazil, fired whistleblower who warned of graft SAO PAULO, August 21 (Reuters) - Healthcare giant Philips was warned of suspicious sales of its medical equipment to the Brazilian government, and failed to halt them, nearly a decade before an alleged bribery racket was exposed in the company’s Brazil operations last year, Reuters has learned. Claims of malfeasance reached the highest levels of the Dutch conglomerate as early as 2010, according to court records filed by federal prosecutors, internal company documents and Reuters interviews with a former manager at a Philips subsidiary in Brazil who says he told superiors of the suspected scheme and was later sacked. That ex-employee, Jose Israel Masiero Filho, a former supply-chain executive with Dixtal Biomedica Industria e Comercio Ltda., spoke extensively with Reuters in his first interview with foreign media. He said in January 2010 he spotted irregularities in three deals to sell Philips and Dixtal equipment to an obscure Brazilian middleman who had landed big contracts with Brazil’s Ministry of Health. Masiero said he suspected payoffs had been used to secure that government business, allegations now at the heart of a burgeoning graft probe in Brazil, court records show. Masiero emailed an internal Philips hotline immediately to report his suspicions, met soon after with the company’s top compliance officer, and alerted at least three other senior executives during 2010. Among them was Steve Rusckowski, former chief executive of Philips Healthcare, the company’s largest division. Masiero’s warnings were detailed in emails, internal company memos and court records viewed by Reuters. “Philips should consider that by approving and accepting these sales, it will be involved in illegal activities if discovered,” Masiero wrote to Rusckowski in an email dated October 14, 2010. Still, Koninklijke Philips PHG.AS, as the company is formally known, continued to sell to the Brazilian intermediary to fulfill the Health Ministry contracts, invoices show. Rusckowski, who served as Philips Healthcare's chief executive until April 2012, did not respond to requests for comment. He is now CEO of New Jersey-based Quest Diagnostics DGX.N. In an emailed statement to Reuters, Philips said it is cooperating with Brazilian authorities investigating the nation’s medical device industry. The company said it launched an internal investigation in 2010 in response to an “anonymous complaint” but “did not identify direct evidence of wrongdoing.” The company said it did, however, tighten up its internal control processes in Brazil. Philips would not discuss ex-employee Masiero or the circumstances surrounding his dismissal. Brazil’s Health Ministry did not respond to requests for comment. Philips is now among the targets in a widening investigation into medical contracting graft in Brazil that authorities say is still in its early stages, and which has sparked additional probes by U.S. law enforcement. Masiero is cooperating with Brazilian prosecutors. They allege Philips and other multinationals conspired with intermediaries to pay bribes for public contracts, charging Brazil’s state healthcare system inflated prices to recoup the cost of the kickbacks. Twenty four people were charged last year in connection with the alleged scheme. All are currently on trial in Rio de Janeiro. Germany's Siemens AG SIEGn.DE and the American firms Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N, General Electric Co GE.N and Stryker Corp SYK.N, all major manufacturers of medical devices, have been swept up in the probe. Johnson & Johnson, Siemens and GE declined to comment. They previously denied wrongdoing and said they were cooperating with the investigation. Stryker said it was committed to working in an ethical manner and that it was unable to comment further. In the United States, the FBI, Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission have launched their own investigations into suspected corruption in sales of medical equipment in Brazil as well as China, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The whistleblower Masiero said he is cooperating with all those agencies, an assertion confirmed in emails viewed by Reuters. The Justice Department, SEC and FBI all declined to comment. Philips told Reuters it is “reviewing” inquiries from the Justice Department and SEC in connection with the Brazil probe. Now 52, Masiero was hired in 2006 to be Dixtal’s exports manager, rising to become the top logistics and supply chain executive for the Sao Paulo-based medical device firm in early 2009. Philips purchased Dixtal in 2008. In early 2010, Masiero noticed what he considered irregularities with three large contracts awarded by Brazil’s Health Ministry. The deals, one for 750 Philips heart defibrillators, the others for a total of 3,972 Dixtal vital-signs monitors, were worth a combined 68.9 million reis (about $40 million at the time), government records show. Masiero said he found it odd that Philips did not compete directly for such a major piece of business. Neither Philips or Dixtal submitted bids, according to government records of tender competitors viewed by Reuters. Instead the contracts were won by Rizzi Comercio e Representacoes Ltda., a little-known Brazilian medical supply firm. Masiero, tasked with getting the equipment to Rizzi Comercio, was surprised to find its billing address was a tiny storefront with peeling purple paint in a dilapidated Sao Paulo neighborhood. “It was an immediate red flag for me,” Masiero told Reuters. In addition, the Health Ministry was paying well above market prices for the equipment, Masiero said, unusual for a large customer with buying clout. On February 12, 2010, for example, Masiero allegedly received an email from a Philips’ sales executive, Frederik Knudsen, directing him to deliver the first shipment of 60 defibrillators to Rizzi Comercio, which marked up those devices an additional 67%, according to correspondence included in court records. “The value that should be on the order is what was agreed to with the Health Ministry” – $16,700 per unit – “and not what we sold them to Rizzi for ($9,991),” according to the email allegedly from Knudsen, which was seen by Reuters. Prosecutors say Philips and Rizzi Comercio conspired to disguise and recoup the cost of bribes through inflated prices, fleecing Brazilian taxpayers in the process. Knudsen, whom Philips confirmed still works for them, is now among those on trial in Rio. So is Daurio Speranzini, who led Philips Healthcare’s operations in Latin America for seven years before joining GE in 2011. He left that firm last December. Both men were charged last August with racketeering and fraud. Knudsen’s lawyers did not respond to requests for comment. In a written defense filed with the court, they said Knudsen did not set Philips’ prices and that he is innocent. In a separate court filing, they also questioned the veracity of the emails their client allegedly sent to Masiero. Speranzini’s lawyers referred questions to their written defense, which contends he had no knowledge of the alleged bribery scheme or of Masiero’s warnings. Also on trial for racketeering and fraud are two brothers who own Rizzi Comercio, Wlademir and Adalberto Rizzi. Their lawyer, who did not respond to requests for comment, said in court filings that her clients engaged in no illegal activities. Uneasy about the deals with Rizzi Comercio, Masiero on January 20, 2010, notified Philips’ global compliance team in Amsterdam through an email hotline. Philips sent Caroline Visser, then-chief of Philips’ global compliance, to Brazil to meet with Masiero in March 2010. She promised a swift investigation, according to emails the pair exchanged. Two months later, Masiero was transferred from Dixtal to a logistics post within Philips in Sao Paulo, a move he considered a demotion and an effort to silence him. The shipments continued, invoices show. Frustrated, Masiero on October 14, 2010, sent an email to Rusckowski, the head of Philips’ healthcare division. Masiero expressed concern about Rizzi Comercio and its use of an unfamiliar intermediary, Moses Trading American, to purchase the U.S.-made Philips heart defibrillators on its behalf for export to Brazil. Far more typical, Masiero told Reuters, would be for Philips to sell directly to Rizzi. Masiero’s uneasiness only increased when he traced Moses Trading American’s address on Philips’ invoices to a private home on a golf course in suburban Phoenix. “Moses Trading selling operation is clearly suspicious,” Masiero wrote to Rusckowski. According to emails reviewed by Reuters, Rusckowski forwarded Masiero’s message to Clement Revetti, Jr., the chief legal officer for Philips Healthcare. Revetti thanked Masiero and asked him not to contact the CEO again. Masiero defied that order. On November 9, 2010, he again emailed Rusckowski and Revetti of his concerns. On March 4, 2011, Masiero says he discussed his suspicions once more in person in Sao Paulo with Visser, the compliance head. He was fired later that day. Masiero said he was given no reason for his dismissal. Paperwork required under Brazilian labor laws shows Philips sacked Masiero “without cause,” meaning the company made no claims that it was performance-related. Visser and Revetti did not respond to requests for comment. As for Moses Trading American, Brazilian prosecutors say that operation is run by a Peruvian named Oscar Moses whom they are investigating in connection with a string of allegedly fraudulent medical equipment deals in Brazil. He has not been charged with a crime. Moses did not respond to requests to comment sent to his Linkedin and Facebook profiles. Discouraged after his firing, Masiero dropped the matter. Then in 2014, Brazil was engulfed by a corruption scandal centered on contracting graft at state oil company Petrobras PETR4.SA. That blockbuster probe, known as Car Wash, ultimately toppled leaders at the highest levels of Brazilian business and politics. Masiero got in touch with federal prosecutors. “His information was key to helping us break up this scheme,” said Marisa Ferrari, a lead prosecutor on the case. Masiero, meanwhile, is unemployed. He said he has been blacklisted in Brazil. He and his family recently left Brazil for a country Masiero does not want to name."

-5.998264845841558," Philips sales spurred by rising Chinese healthcare spending AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Rising healthcare spending by the Chinese government helped Dutch health technology company Philips PHG.AS post better-than-expected sales growth for the second quarter, putting its shares among the top performers in Europe on Monday. Philips, which sells products ranging from toothbrushes to medical imaging systems, said comparable sales had improved 6% in the second quarter. Analysts had on average only penciled in a 4.5% improvement. Philips shares rose 4% in the first hours of trading in Amsterdam, making them one of the top performers in the Stoxx600. Growth was helped by a “double digit” sales increase in China, Philips said, as the Chinese government ramps up healthcare spending, expanding hospitals and investing in more advanced technologies. “Healthcare in China is still not sufficient to meet the demands of an ageing society,” Chief Executive Frans van Houten told Reuters in a phone interview. “The government has said it would expand capacity, and that is exactly what is happening. This trend for us is more important than fluctuations in GDP (gross domestic product) growth, and we expect it to continue in the coming years.” Demand and orders for hospital equipment, medical systems and personal care devices also increased in the United States and Europe, keeping Philips optimistic about the months to come. “We saw growth in all our segments in the second quarter and we expect that to continue”, Van Houten told reporters. “We had strong traction in emerging markets and that is set to continue. Also, we expect mature markets to come in stronger in the second half of the year.” Although sales in the U.S. and China remained strong, Philips said the trade disputes between the two countries remained its main worry, as both its end products and components are hit by new tariffs. “The main cloud hanging over us is the possible fourth batch of tariffs,” Van Houten said. “If that would happen, it would increase the amount by which our earnings are hit by 20 million euros this year, but nobody knows whether it will happen.” Philips currently expects tariffs to shave 45 million euros ($51 million) off its 2019 core earnings. Once a sprawling conglomerate, Philips is now purely focused on healthcare after spinning off its lighting and consumer electronics divisions in recent years. The company reaffirmed its target for total comparable sales growth of 4% to 6% per year until 2020, and said its profit margin would move up from 13.1 to around 14% this year. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (EBITA) jumped 14% to 549 million euros in the second quarter, while the margin climbed 60 basis points to 11.8%, roughly meeting expectations."

14.942257947275495," Philips upbeat on digital care as patients warm to data sharing AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Dutch health technology company Philips expects sales at its digital care business to grow this year as patients see the benefits of sharing more medical data with doctors, Chief Executive Frans van Houten told Reuters. Philips’ connected care division offers platforms to remotely monitor patients and for doctors to share patient data. “We expect to see a positive trend in connected care this year, with sales growth picking up,” Van Houten said in an interview. Its sales have lagged those of the company’s bigger divisions, which sell large medical equipment and personal care devices, stagnating in 2018 and falling 1% in the first quarter of 2019. But Philips, which has spun off its lighting and consumer electronics divisions and now focuses purely on healthcare, expects rising life expectancy and associated chronic diseases to lead to growing demand for devices that allow patients to stay at home, while being monitored. That view was supported by an international study, published this week, which showed patients with access to their digital health records are more satisfied with the care they receive and are very willing to share that data with doctors. The study, which involved 15,000 patients and 3,100 doctors across 15 countries and was commissioned by Philips, also showed that two thirds of people who don’t have access to their own records want doctors and other health professionals to have access to their data. Some 70% of the doctors interviewed with access to digital records said it improved their work. “Data is the new gold”, Van Houten said. “We are absolutely convinced that sharing more data leads to better diagnosis, better treatment and better outcomes, improving the productivity of doctors.” Increasing use of digital records could help Philips, as it sells software tools for doctors to gather data from records and devices that allow patients to collect health data, such as blood pressure and cholesterol levels, at home and immediately share them with doctors. “People want their data to be used”, Van Houten said. “Although the general perception seems to be of an aversion towards data sharing, we actually see the opposite when it comes to health care.”"

18.438403248678508," Philips expects sales growth to accelerate after weak first quarter AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Dutch health technology company Philips said on Monday it expects sales to accelerate in coming months on improved demand in Europe and the United States after a weak first quarter. A decline in demand for hospital equipment in Europe and flat sales in the United States capped overall comparable quarterly sales growth to 2.3 percent, even though results in China and other emerging markets were much more upbeat. The maker of heathcare products which range from high-tech toothbrushes to medical imaging systems, stuck to its target of 4 to 6 percent annual sales growth until 2020, saying demand in Europe and the U.S. will pick up rapidly. “We expect much stronger growth in mature markets in the second and third quarter”, Chief Executive Frans van Houten told reporters. The order book in those markets is strong and this will result in sales growth.” Philips shares traded up 2.7 percent at 37.17 euros in Amsterdam at 0926 GMT. “It is encouraging to see a better performance in Personal Health given that this dominated much of the narrative last year,” Berenberg analyst Scott Bardo wrote in a note. “We believe better group growth and margin improvement is in store over the course of the year and we expect Philips to fulfil guidance.” Once a sprawling conglomerate, Philips has transformed itself into a health technology specialist in recent years, shedding its consumer electronics and lighting divisions. It reported sales growth of 2 to 5 percent for its two largest businesses, hospital equipment and personal healthcare products, in the first quarter. Overall, adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (EBITA) improved 6 percent, to 364 million euros ($406.2 million). Revenues of its connected care division, which specializes in remote patient monitoring, dropped 1 percent. Philips expects rising life expectancy and associated chronic diseases to lead to growing demand for devices that allow patients to stay at home, while their data is monitored. But Van Houten in November said demand for such products would remain modest in 2019. Medical equipment sales were mainly driven by double digit growth in image guided therapy devices, which allow for minimally invasive operations. Philips expects this strong growth to continue, Van Houten said, as these devices help doctors limit the time patients have to spend in hospitals."

9.148776935078097," Philips shifting 'hundreds of millions' of production due to trade war AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The trade war between Washington and Beijing is forcing Dutch health technology company Philips to move “hundreds of millions” of euros worth of production from the United States to China, and vice versa, to avoid punitive tariffs. “This is not peanuts”, Chief Executive Frans van Houten told reporters on Tuesday. “These are serious changes to our supply chains,” he said, adding the switches would take place in the first half of 2019. Philips, whose healthcare products range from high-tech toothbrushes to medical imaging systems, stuck to an earlier prediction that increased trade tariffs would cut around 60 million euros ($69 million) from core profits this year. But the effects of the trade war go beyond tariffs, the CEO said, as it is hitting consumer confidence in China, slowing demand for consumer healthcare products in the world’s second-largest economy. Philips’ sales in China will continue to grow in 2019, however, Van Houten said, as strong demand for hospital equipment will outweigh the weakness of the consumer market. Overall, Philips held on to its target for total comparable sales growth of 4 to 6 percent per year until 2020. Strong demand for hospital equipment in China, Latin America and Europe helped Philips beat analysts’ forecasts in the last quarter of 2018, as comparable sales rose 5 percent and core profit (adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) increased 10 percent to 971 million euros. Together with a 6 percent dividend hike and a new 1.5 billion euros share buyback plan, this lifted Philips shares 1.8 percent to 32.89 euros at 0930 GMT. “On headline numbers, Philips reported a decent update”, ING analyst Marc Hesselink wrote in a note. “Underlying, the quality of the beat was lower (as) Connected Care & Healthcare Informatics was, like previous quarters, well below expectations.” Rival Siemens Healthineers said on Tuesday it would take steps to raise profitability at its diagnostics unit after lengthy installation times for its new Atellica blood and urine testing machines hit profit at the division. Philips reported comparable sales growth of 3 to 5 percent for its two largest businesses, which make hospital equipment and personal healthcare products. Sales of its connected care division, which specializes in remote patient monitoring, were flat. Philips expects rising life expectancy and associated chronic diseases to lead to growing demand for devices that allow patients to stay at home, while their data is monitored.

-2.300106042451625," Philips shares drop as earnings fall short after currency headwinds AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Dutch healthcare technology company Philips PHG.AS missed estimates for core profit in the third quarter on Monday, sending its shares to their lowest in more than six months. The company, which makes products ranging from electric toothbrushes to medical imaging systems selling for millions of euros, cited “currency headwinds” for the shortfall, though some analysts said underlying growth was subpar. Philips said core earnings rose 6.8 percent to 568 million euros ($863 million) from 532 million a year before. Analysts polled for Reuters had seen adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and amortization (EBITA) at 590 million euros. Shares, which had already slid 8 percent since early October, dropped another 6.3 percent to 32.55 euros in early trade, hitting their lowest since early April. Philips CEO Frans van Houten blamed currency headwinds and said it was “quite an achievement” that comparable sales grew by 4 percent, compared to zero growth in the second quarter. Analysts at Berenberg said the sales increase was “not quite the bounce-back in growth that the market was looking for,” adding in a note: “Overall, this was a softer than expected quarter and management commentary surrounding ... ‘headwinds’ could spook the market.” The analysts also noted softer trends in both growth and profitability in the group’s Personal Health and Connected Care and Health Informatics businesses, though they repeated a positive view on the shares and said investors should buy on weakness. Analysts at ING, who also rate shares “buy”, said in a note that “organic growth was below expectations in all divisions.” Philips said margins had improved and order intake was up 11 percent from a year ago, notably in China, which had seen weak growth in the second quarter. “When you look at our order book growth of 11 percent, that’s actually pretty phenomenal because already for four quarters in a row we are growing in double digits, outpacing market growth,” Van Houten said. The CEO said this boded well for a revenue increase next year, noting it takes about nine months for orders to show up in the company’s earnings. Van Houten warned he was increasingly worried by the prospect of Britain leaving the European Union with no deal in place. If Brexit occurs without a Britain-EU customs union, that would force the company to “revisit our manufacturing footprint,” including its manufacturing plant in Glemsford, eastern England, he said. The company’s EBITA margin improved by 0.4 percent to 13.2 percent of sales and Van Houten repeated a target of 4 to 6 percent average comparable sales growth over the 2017-2020 period. Philips’ largest division, which makes medical imaging equipment such as ultrasound machines, saw comparable sales rise 6 percent to 1.75 billion euros, with growth skewed toward emerging markets and North America. Comparable sales fell 2 percent to 741 million euros at its Connected Care or patient monitoring business, and rose 4 percent to 1.68 billion euros at its Personal Care business, which includes toothbrushes as well as sleep and breathing aid devices."
-2.300106042451625," Philips CEO says Brexit putting Britain at risk as manufacturing hub AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The chief executive of Philips PHG.AS said on Monday he was worried about the lack of progress on a deal over the terms of Britain's exit from the European Union, and warned that a no-deal Brexit would jeopardize the country's position as a manufacturing hub. “As time passes and there is no solution I get increasingly worried that hereafter frictionless trade between the United Kingdom and European mainland could be at risk,” Frans van Houten told reporters after the company posted worse-than-expected third-quarter earnings. “Basically the UK as a manufacturing hub for the world would be at risk.” Philips’ main exporting plant in England is at Glemsford, where Van Houten said he would expect production to fall in case of a “hard” or no-deal Brexit. “We are looking at a customs union as a minimum (requirement),” for a negotiated Brexit, he said. “If that were not to happen we would need to rethink our manufacturing footprint.”"

Comparable second-quarter sales fell 3.4 percent to 1.54 billion euros ($1.79 billion), extending a weak start to the year. Chief Executive Eric Rondolat said sales were expected to recover in the second half but not enough for the company to deliver on its promise of year-on-year sales growth. The world’s largest lighting maker said it would repurchase shares worth 229 million euros in the second half of the year, doubling the amount earlier promised for 2018 from its original size of 150 million euros. The company, spun off from Philips in 2016, bought back 71 million euros of shares in the first half. The lowered outlook for 2018 did not come as a surprise, ING analysts said in a note, while the slight underperformance of the second-quarter results was “nothing major” in their view. The increased share buyback served as “an extra”, they said, helping lift shares 8.4 percent to 24.46 euros at 0845 GMT, their highest level since June 18. Despite the rally, Signify shares are still down 20 percent since the start of the year, after disappointing first-quarter results led to a sharp drop in the share price in April. Signify said its results were hurt by a worldwide shortage of important electronic components, as suppliers are failing to meet earlier commitments for shipments. “This is a temporary problem, but it can last a while,” Rondolat told reporters. “We are managing the supply situation week by week, which has never happened to us before. Our visibility on what can be delivered has lowered dramatically.” Rondolat also said the performance of Signify’s Home division remained weak as resellers in the United States were still selling down excess stock build-up before the holiday season. The Home division focuses on newer technologies in lighting such as its Hue line of networked LED lights that can be adjusted by mobile phone. Sales of LED lamps were flat year-on-year while those of traditional light bulbs declined by 16 percent. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, and amortisation (EBITA) dropped 18 percent to 130 million euros. Sales and core profits were slightly below the average expectations in a Reuters analysts poll."
-17.74080841058," Philips, Asus, Pioneer and D&M hit with e-commerce fines BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Dutch group Philips PHG.AS and three other consumer electronics companies were fined a total 111.2 million euros ($130 million) by EU antitrust regulators on Tuesday for imposing fixed or minimum online prices for their products. The ruling against Philips, Asus 2357.TW, Pioneer 6773.T and Denon & Marantz followed a 17-month investigation by the European Commisssion as part of its crackdown on online sales practices such as price restrictions based on a customer's location or nationality. The investigation, which began in February last year, was one of three that covered a total of 15 companies in the consumer electronics, video game and hotel sectors. The four companies fined on Tuesday were found to have restricted the ability of online retailers to set their own prices for products such as kitchen appliances, notebook computers and hi-fi products, insisting on fixed or minimum resale prices, the EU said. Pioneer was also found by the EU to have sought to limit the ability of its retailers to sell across borders. It engaged in illegal practices in 12 EU countries, including France, Germany, the Netherlands and Britain, the Commission said, adding that the other companies did so in one or two countries. “As a result of the actions taken by these four companies, millions of European consumers faced higher prices for kitchen appliances, hair dryers, notebook computers, headphones and many other products,” European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement. Asus was fined 63.5 million euros, Philips 29.8 million euros, Pioneer 10.2 million euros and Denon & Marantz 7.7 million euros. Asus declined to comment. Pioneer and Denon could not be reached for comment outside business hours. Philips did not respond immediately to requests for comment. All the companies cooperated and admitted wrongdoing in return for 40-50 percent cuts in their fines. Vestager's action comes a week after she dished out a record 4.34 billion euro fine against Google GOOGL.O. The latest fines for Asian and European companies could strengthen the hand of European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker when he meets U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Wednesday. Trump has previously complained of unfair treatment of U.S. companies by the EU. Vestager said that the Google decision was not political and that if Google had a complaint it could take the Commission to court. Required changes in Google’s practices would also give opportunities to other companies, including U.S. businesses, she said. A second EU investigation into video games targeted Valve Corp, owner of the Steam distribution platform and five game makers - Bandai Namco 7832.T, Capcom 9697.T, Focus Home, Koch Media and ZeniMax - accused of preventing purchases because of a consumer's location or country of residence. The third investigation focused on tour operators Kuoni, REWE REGRP.UL, Thomas Cook and TUI and hotel group Melia."

-13.675206361497441," UPDATE 2-Philips says sales growth to improve after China causes Q2 miss * Philips Q2 sales growth falls short of analyst expectations * Sales of personal healthcare products decline in China * Philips CEO says sales growth will improve in H2 (Adds CEO quotes, share price, analyst comment, more detail on outlook for H2) AMSTERDAM, July 23 (Reuters) - Temporary problems in China led to disappointing second quarter sales at Dutch healthcare technology company Philips but sales growth is expected to strengthen in the second half of the year, it said on Monday. Philips reported a 4 percent increase in comparable sales last quarter to 4.29 billion euros. That was the bottom end of the company’s targeted range and below the average of 4.9 percent predicted in a Reuters poll, as sales of personal healthcare products declined in China. Chief Executive Frans van Houten said this was mainly caused by a fall in demand for air purifiers, as China makes strides in its fight against air pollution, and by Chinese on-line sellers trimming their inventories. “We are not worried by these developments”, Van Houten told Reuters in a telephone interview. “There are no structural problems in China. The second half of the year will be better, for our personal health division and overall.” Philips maintained its full year forecast of “mid single digit” growth for the personal health division, whose products range from toothbrushes to machines to relieve sleep apnea. Sales of the division rose 2 percent in the second quarter. Philips shares fell 3.1 percent to 35.53 euros at 0835 GMT, making them the worst performer on Amsterdam’s blue chip AEX index, with analysts citing the performance of the personal health division as their main concern. “The top line was a little soft, mainly stemming from personal health, however, new launches should see this improve in H2”, Berenberg analyst Scott Bardo said in a note. Despite Monday’s loss, Philips shares are still up 13 percent since the start of the year. Van Houten said his optimism for the coming months was mainly fuelled by ongoing strong growth in orders for hospital equipment, such as medical scanners and ultrasound machines, especially in China and the United States. Hospital orders in these markets showed double digit growth again in the second quarter, leading to an overall increase in new orders of 9 percent. “We have seen this rate of growth in orders for several quarters now”, Van Houten said. “This tells us we are on the right track.” The strength in the Diagnostics and Treatment division helped adjusted earnings before interest, taxes and amortisation (EBITA) rise 10 percent to 482 million euros ($565.5 million) in the second quarter, in line with analyst expectations. Van Houten confirmed Philips’ sales growth target of 4 to 6 percent for this year, but said trade worries and the unknown consequences of Brexit continued to cause uncertainty."

2.6770920335743815," Philips to buy heart rhythm disorder specialist EPD Solutions for $292.1 million AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Dutch healthcare technology company Philips PHG.AS said on Tuesday it will buy EPD Solutions, a maker of cardiac imaging and navigation systems used to treat patients with heart rhythm disorders. Philips will pay 250 million euros in cash ($292.1 million) upfront, followed by payments estimated to be worth around 210 million euros if milestones are met. The takeover will give Philips a significant position in the rapidly growing market for cardiac arrhythmia ablation procedures within several years, Chief Executive Frans van Houten told reporters. “It will take time to penetrate this market, already worth more than 2 billion euros, as most healthcare providers are conservative”, he said. “But EPD has a highly competitive, breakthrough technology, which can really address unmet needs.” EPD’s system provides surgeons with “unique” detailed 3D anatomical information of the heart during ablation procedures, Van Houten said. Since the separation of its lighting division LIGHT.AS in 2016, Philips has focused on medical devices and healthcare products. The takeover of EPD Solutions further expands the company’s image-guided therapy business, after the multi-billion dollar acquisitions of heart disease devices maker Spectranetics last year and vascular imaging company Volcano in 2015. Van Houten said Philips will continue to acquire companies in what it sees as core markets, such as image-guided therapy. Philips’ sales in image-guided therapy showed double-digit growth in the first quarter of 2018, driving comparable sales of its Diagnosis & Treatment division up 9 percent to 1.5 billion euros."

6.7953207190306575," Philips Lighting shares tumble after Q1 earnings miss AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Shares in Philips Lighting LIGHT.AS fell sharply on Thursday after the world's largest lighting maker reported worse than expected first-quarter earnings due to falling sales and margins, especially in the United States. Philips, which flagged in February its quarterly earnings would be weak, made adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, and amortisation (EBITA) of 106 million euros ($129 million), down from 127 million euros in the same period a year ago. Analysts polled for Reuters had seen EBITA rising to 129 million euros. At 0730 GMT, Philips shares were down 10.1 percent at 27.00 euros. The drop in earnings was “mainly due to a weak performance in Home, most notably in the United States,” said CEO Eric Rondolat in a statement, referring to a division that focuses on newer technologies in lighting such as its Hue line of networked LED lights that can be adjusted by mobile phone. EBITA at its traditional lamps business, which is highly profitable but in long-term decline, fell to 78 million euros from 100 million a year earlier, as better margins could not compensate for a 24 percent drop in sales. Group sales fell 3.5 percent to 1.50 billion euros, while EBITA margins slipped to 7.0 percent from 7.5 percent. On a call with reporters, Rondolat said the weakness at the Home division came after resellers had built up excess inventory for the holiday season and were working through it - the reason for the February warning. “Our other three businesses (lamps, LEDs and professional lighting) further improved their operational profitability,” particularly the professional division, Rondolat said. ING analyst Marc Zwartsenburg said in a note the results made “the investment case weaker as Professional and Home lighting are the future growth drivers.” He repeated a “hold” rating on the shares. Bright spots in the earnings included a note that declines in LED prices are slowing. The company also kept its full-year forecast for EBITA margins of 10-10.5 percent, with growing sales.

1.8306932371428115," Trade war worries Philips as it banks on China growth AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Philips PHG.AS is worried about rising trade tensions between the United States and China, said the Dutch health-technology company that is banking on continuing Chinese demand for its high-end medical equipment. Strong demand from Chinese hospitals for its ultrasound machines, medical scanners and other equipment helped Philips’ first-quarter results beat analyst expectations on Monday, but the simmering trade dispute between the United States and China could threaten future earnings. “So far the effects are modest, but we are worried about the trade tensions,” Chief Executive Frans van Houten told Reuters in a telephone interview. “We don’t expect any tariffs to be imposed on medical equipment, but we see indirect effects through the rising cost of commodities such as aluminum and steel. We can’t isolate ourselves from that, nor from the effects on economic confidence overall.” Philips shares rose 4.8 percent to 34.52 euros by 1025 GMT, leading the blue-chip AEX index in Amsterdam. “The (profit) beat is mainly driven by the Diagnostics & Treatment business,” said ING analyst Marc Zwartsenburg, referring to the division that makes hospital equipment. He also noted the 10 percent rise in new orders. Growth in the diagnosis and treatment division was especially strong in China, where Philips achieved double-digit growth. “We expect to maintain this growth rate for the rest of the year,” Van Houten said. “All signals are positive and we have no reason to expect a slowdown.” There was also strong demand from U.S. hospitals, though the picture in Europe was less favorable as many hospitals continue to grapple with the effects on their budgets after years of austerity. On the upside, this has led to a noticeable uptake in the long-term partnerships Philips offers to hospitals, Van Houten said. In the first quarter the company sealed eight new contracts, in which the company offers new equipment and technological assistance for a fixed yearly rate, taking the total number to more than 100 worldwide. Philips fared less well with its connected care and informatics business, with customers hesitant to invest heavily in what Philips ultimately sees as a major growth market, Van Houten said. The division, which includes patient monitoring systems and software used by hospitals to gather and analyze data, will show better results in the months to come, the CEO said, and is still expected to hit the 4-6 percent sales growth target Philips has for all its divisions. Overall, core profit in the first three months of the year rose 15 percent to 344 million euros ($422.1 million) on comparable sales growth of 5 percent. Analysts in a Reuters poll had predicted adjusted earnings before interest, tax and amortization (EBITA) for the first quarter of 332 million euros on sales up 4.3 percent."
