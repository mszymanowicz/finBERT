3.361344537815129," Signet Jewelers in $240 million settlement over sexual harassment, loan portfolio NEW YORK (Reuters) - Signet Jewelers Ltd has reached a $240 million settlement of a shareholder lawsuit accusing the company of concealing sexual harassment allegations against senior executives and losses in its customer financing credit portfolio. The preliminary settlement of the proposed class action was filed on Thursday with the federal court in Manhattan, and requires approval by Chief Judge Colleen McMahon. Signet, whose brands include Jared, Kay Jewelers and Zales, also posted higher-than-expected operating profit and revenue in its fiscal fourth quarter ended Feb. 1, with same-store sales rising 2.3%. It said it expects to pay about $35 million of the settlement, with insurers funding the remainder. Shares of Signet soared, and in early afternoon trading were up $2.86, or 39%, at $10.19. The settlement resolved claims that Signet concealed how it had once been “rife with sexual harassment” of female employees, including by senior executives, and downplayed its alleged misconduct as involving merely allegations of gender discrimination in pay and promotions at individual stores. Shareholders led by the Public Employees’ Retirement System of Mississippi also said Signet concealed losses on subprime loans that once comprised 45% of its $1.7 billion customer loan portfolio, and which it later sold at a roughly $160 million loss. The accord covers shareholders from Aug. 29, 2013 to May 25, 2017 who said Signet’s violation of federal securities laws caused them to suffer losses on their stock. In a statement, Signet said it takes its legal disclosure obligations seriously and believed the lawsuit lacked merit, but settled to eliminate “the risks, ongoing resource needs, and the distraction of this litigation.” In its fiscal fourth quarter, Signet posted net income of $187.1 million, compared with a year-earlier $107.9 million net loss. Adjusted profit totaled $3.67 per share on revenue of $2.15 billion. Analysts expected profit of $3.47 per share on revenue of $2.12 billion according to Refinitiv IBES. To bolster financial flexibility during the coronavirus pandemic, Signet said it has drawn down an additional $900 million from a secured credit facility, and temporarily suspended its common stock dividend."
-5.182122105639101," Judge denies Signet's second bid to toss sex harassment securities claims A federal judge in Manhattan on Tuesday rejected Signet Jewelers Ltd’s claims that its stated commitment to preventing sexual harassment was mere “puffery” that could not be used to support fraud claims by investors who say the company concealed a culture of pervasive harassment against women. U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon said that statements a company includes in its code of conduct can be specific enough for shareholders to rely on them in making investment decisions, and denied Signet’s motion for judgment on the pleadings.

-29.9891476556709," Signet Jewelers unit pays $11 million fines to end U.S., New York probes NEW YORK (Reuters) - Sterling Jewelers Inc, whose brands include Kay Jewelers and Jared, agreed to pay $11 million in fines to settle charges by U.S. and New York regulators that it signed up consumers for store credit cards and credit insurance without permission. The settlement announced on Wednesday calls for Sterling, a unit of Signet Jewelers Ltd, to pay $10 million to the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and $1 million to the office of New York Attorney General Letitia James. Sterling did not admit or deny wrongdoing. James said Sterling pressured employees to enroll customers in store-branded credit cards by setting quotas, and tying performance reviews and pay to whether the quotas were met. She said the Akron, Ohio-based company also tricked consumers into providing personal information to enroll in what they thought were “rewards” or discount programs, only to use the information to submit credit card applications. Even when consumers wanted credit cards, Sterling misled some into thinking they were getting “no interest” financing, when in fact there were monthly financing fees, James added. “This settlement holds the company accountable for its misconduct and ensures that no more consumers are deceived,” James said. Sterling has about 130 stores in New York, James added. Signet disclosed the investigations in December 2017. It will recognize an $11 million pre-tax charge for the settlement in the quarter ending Feb. 2, 2019. In a statement, Signet said it disagreed with the allegations, but cooperated fully with the probes and “looks forward to continuing to provide our customers with access to suitable credit options.” The company said it is the largest specialty jewelry retailer in the United States, United Kingdom and Canada, with roughly 3,600 stores including the Zales brand. Signet shares rose 45 cents to $34.27 in morning trading."
