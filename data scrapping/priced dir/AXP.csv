17.850478960432213," Amex reveals U.S. probes into business, consumer cards sales practices WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal investigators began probing American Express Co’s small business and consumer cards sales practices in January, the company disclosed on Friday. Amex received a subpoena from the United States Attorney’s Office for the Eastern District of New York regarding its small business cards sales practices, Amex said in a regulatory filing. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) also demanded information on its sales practices related to consumers. “We are cooperating with all of these inquiries and have continued to enhance our controls related to our sales practices. We do not believe this matter will have a material adverse impact on our business or results of operations,” Amex said in the filing. Since May 2020, Amex has also been cooperating with a review led by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Department of Justice regarding historical sales practices relating to certain small business card sales, the company said. Spokespeople for the Department of Justice, the CFPB and the OCC did not immediately respond to requests for comment."
29.825117858783933," AmEx sees consumer travel recovery after lower spending hits profit (Reuters) - American Express Co said on Tuesday it expects an uptick in holiday travel this summer, but not business travel, as it seeks to recover from a year which dented airline traffic and hotel bookings, knocking 15% off its bottom line. The New York-based company still beat Wall Street estimates for profit as it lowered credit loss reserves and benefited from higher online spending by consumers stuck at home. “...As we get into this summer season, this June, July, August and September, you will see a rush for people to travel, especially air travel,” CEO Stephen Squeri said on a post-earnings conference call. AmEx forecast a 9% to 10% jump in overall 2021 revenue, with travel and expenditure (T&E) spending by consumers recovering to around 70% of fourth-quarter 2019 levels by the final quarter of 2021. That indicates full-year revenue of $39.7 billion on the upper end of the range, marginally below consensus estimates of $39.92 billion. The bullish outlook for travel, however, failed to lift shares, which fell 3% in late morning trade after AmEx’s total revenue, net of interest expense, dropped 17.1% to $36.09 billion. A rebound in corporate travel will take longer, AmEx warned, with companies, particularly large ones, limiting their T&E spending for some time. T&E spending on AmEx’s cards declined 65% in the final quarter of 2020. The company does not expect a full-blown recovery before 2022, but is focused on achieving the EPS expectations it had for 2020 in 2022, Squeri said. AmEx also lowered some reserves it had set aside for credit losses and posted a gain of $111 million from consolidated provisions, compared with credit loss provisions of $1.02 billion last year. Net income fell to $1.44 billion, or $1.76 per share, for the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with estimates for a profit of $1.31 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv."

The New York-based credit card issuer said it has achieved 100% pay equity for its employees and would continue to do so, as well as promote practices to hire and retain underrepresented colleagues, including Black, Latinx and female colleagues. The company also said it intends to double its spending on diverse and minority-owned suppliers in the United States to $750 million annually, as well as provide grants to non-profit organizations by the end of 2024.

20.394934665085056," AmEx issues dismal outlook on business travel spending as profit slumps (Reuters) - American Express Co on Friday warned that business travel spending would not pick up before early 2022 after reporting underwhelming third-quarter profit due to weak spending on travel and entertainment by its card users. In what appears to be a shift in strategy, the New York-based credit card issuer also walked back on its cost-cutting target of nearly $1 billion in 2020 and instead decided to spend heavily to add new card customers. “We have begun to selectively spend in areas critical to rebuilding growth momentum ... we expect our Q2 through Q4 year-over-year OpEx declines will be somewhat less than the $1 billion we initially discussed back in April, which ... was at the moment of peak uncertainty about the future,” Chief Financial Officer Jeff Campbell said in a post-earnings conference call with analysts. Credit card companies have been hit hard as the pandemic-induced recession forces companies to lay off workers and consumers to stay at home. Spending on AmEx cards fell 19% to $248.7 billion in the quarter, with travel and entertainment related spending sliding 69% from a year earlier. “We’re all consistent in terms of how we feel about business travel, which is probably not going to (pick up) till late 2021, early 2022,” Chief Executive Officer Stephen Squeri said on the call with analysts. AmEx, which has tie-ups with large airlines and hotels and whose largest shareholder is Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc, set aside $665 million in loss provisions during the quarter. However, that was less than it set aside last quarter, as the outlook for potential defaults improved, with AmEx saying overall spending volumes had shown a “steady recovery” since the lows of mid-April. Online consumer retail spending was a bright spot for the card issuer during the quarter, clocking a 32% jump over last year. Non-travel and entertainment spending, which includes online and offline retail spending, inched up 1% from a year ago after adjusting for cross-currency fluctuations. Quarterly profit fell 40% to $1.07 billion, or $1.30 per share, missing analysts’ average estimate of $1.35 per share, according to Refinitiv data, hurt mainly by higher-than-expected expenses. Total revenue, excluding interest expense, fell 20% to $8.8 billion, but came in ahead of muted expectations.

19.90415824355575," American Express to acquire online lender Kabbage NEW YORK (Reuters) - American Express AXP.N said on Monday it would buy fintech lender and platform Kabbage in a move aimed at bolstering its cash management offering to small businesses. Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed. Backed by investors including SoftBank Group 9984.T, Kabbage started out in 2009 as an online lender, although it has since broadened its offering into other financial services for small businesses. Building on its corporate cards strength, AmEx has been focused on growing its offering for small business clients into complementary areas such as payments and cash flow technology solutions, the company’s president of global commercial services, Anna Marrs, told Reuters. This is the second acquisition which AmEx has made in recent months, as part of this strategy, Marrs added. AmEx announced in July 2019 it would buy digital payments firm acompay. Under the terms of the deal, AmEx will acquire the technology, people and data of Kabbage, although not its loan book, according to a statement. During the coronavirus pandemic, Kabbage has been heavily involved in the Paycheck Protection Program, the U.S. government’s small business stimulus program. The company said last month it had issued 225,000 approved loans for nearly $6 billion, making it the third-largest lender by application volume. Lenders which used technology to improve the loan process expanded rapidly in the years since the financial crisis, although the recent economic uncertainty has put some under pressure. Last month, Enova International ENVA.N said it would purchase OnDeck Capital."

6.369221071786435," British Airways-owner IAG boosted by 750 million pounds deal with American Express LONDON (Reuters) - British Airways-owner International Airlines Group ICAG.L said American Express would pay it 750 million pounds ($955 million) to renew their partnership, providing a welcome boost to the airline's finances at a time when it is burning through cash. Since lockdowns have eased, flying has restarted, but pressure remains on airline companies like IAG because travel is still at less than half of pre-pandemic levels due to ongoing restrictions for some destinations and consumer worries. IAG’s finances have been strained by the pandemic, leading to media speculation that it could need to raise new equity. It said at the end of April that it had 10 billion euros ($11.6 billion) of liquidity and it was burning through 200 million euros a week. The 750 million pound boost from the partnership deal announced on Friday could give it more breathing space. Goodbody analysts said in a note that the news was positive, giving the company, whose liquidity could have fallen to around 4 billion euros since its last update, another month’s worth of cash burn. Shares in IAG were down 1.7% at 205 pence, in line with the FTSE 100 index. IAG’s shares have lost 67% of their value so far in 2020. IAG said that the multi-year renewal agreement with American Express would extend the commercial partnership with the payments company, and that American Express was paying IAG to pre-purchase Avios points, which members of rewards programmes can use to buy flights. The airline group, which also owns Iberia, Vueling and Aer Lingus, is due to report second quarter results on July 31."

The approval comes against a backdrop of high Sino-U.S. tensions, with disagreements over trade and Beijing’s imposition of a national security law for Hong Kong. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) said in a statement Saturday that it had approved the license for Express (Hangzhou) Technology Services Co., a joint venture between American Express and LianLian DigiTech Co Ltd. It said the move reflected China’s continued opening up of its financial industry. The PBOC said in January that it had received American Express’s application to start operations in China. In a statement, American Express said it expects to begin processing transactions later this year. “This approval represents an important step forward in our long-term growth strategy and is an historic moment, not only for American Express but for the continued growth and development of the payments industry in mainland China,” Stephen J. Squeri, chairman and chief executive officer of American Express, said. The PBOC has also approved an application by Mastercard's MA.N China joint venture to conduct bank card clearing operations in the country, but the company has not yet received a network clearing license. Card giant Visa V.N submitted its application in early 2018 and is still awaiting approval. China is opening its local currency payments market to foreign companies after a decade of lobbying by foreign players seeking direct access to what is expected to soon become the world’s biggest bank card market."

U.S. retail sales fell for the first time in seven months in September, adding to concerns after data showed a moderation in job growth and services sector activity in the last month. New York-based AmEx, for long the preferred choice of affluent Americans for credit cards, however, quelled investor concerns with its ninth straight quarter of foreign exchange adjusted revenue growth of at least 8%. “The trends we saw in the business this quarter continue to be consistent with an economy that continues to grow, albeit at a more modest pace than last year,” Chief Executive Officer Steve Squeri said. U.S. big banks’ quarterly results also showed that American consumers are helping to prop up the economy, even as recession fears have led businesses to pull back on spending and borrowing. “We see a long runway to sustain this performance. In the (fourth quarter), we expect revenue growth to continue with the strong levels we have seen,” Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey Campbell told analysts on a post-earnings conference call. AmEx reaffirmed its 2019 adjusted earnings per share forecast range of $7.85 to $8.35 and said it expects revenue growth of between 8% and 10% in the fourth quarter. The company, whose largest shareholder is Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc BRKa.N, has ramped up reward programs on its cards and struck partnership deals with a number of firms to counter competition from JPMorgan Chase & Co's JPM.N Sapphire Reserve and Citigroup Inc's C.N Prestige Card. AmEx said foreign exchange adjusted proprietary card member spending rose 7% in the third quarter, led by strong consumer growth in both the United States and international markets. Net income rose to $1.76 billion, or $2.08 per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, from $1.65 billion, or $1.88 per share, a year earlier, the company said. Analysts had expected a profit of $2.03 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

13.527453849139343," American Express misses estimates on slowing customer spending; shares drop (Reuters) - American Express Co AXP.N missed Wall Street's fourth-quarter profit estimates on Thursday, as the rate of customer spending slowed despite a strong U.S. holiday sales season. The credit-card issuer’s shares fell 2.4 percent in extended trading. “For the past couple of quarters card spending for AmEx in the U.S. has been 10 percent, that dropped down to about 9 percent this quarter, that is having an effect on the stock,” Buckingham Research Group analyst Chris Brendler said. The slowing growth came despite the United States witnessing its strongest holiday season in six years on the back of a robust economy and more deals. According to a Mastercard report on Dec. 26, holiday spending rose 5.1 percent to over $850 billion. This strong health of the consumer spurred more customers to take loans on credit cards in the quarter, growing AmEx’s loan portfolio by 12 percent in the fourth quarter. However, this also drove provisions for credit losses higher by 14 percent. Meanwhile, expenses rose 9 percent as AmEx poured more money into offering perks such as rewards programs and lounge access at airports to better compete against companies such as JPMorgan's JPM.N Chase cards division and payment networks Visa V.N and Mastercard MA.N. Card member rewards expenses rose 11 percent, AmEx said.

11.89815730160199," U.S. Supreme Court backs American Express in merchant fee dispute WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday sided with American Express Co and against 11 states, ruling that the company’s policy of forbidding merchants from encouraging customers to use rival credit cards with lower fees does not violate federal antitrust law. Handing American Express an important legal victory that validated a key component of its business model, the justices upheld a lower court decision that had cleared the company of unlawfully stifling competition through so-called anti-steering provisions in its contracts with merchants. The decision was 5-4, with the court’s conservative justices in the majority and liberals dissenting. Major retailers panned it as bad for consumers. After the ruling, shares of American Express were up 1 percent in late afternoon trading. Shares of rivals Visa Inc and Mastercard Inc both fell, with Visa down 3.8 percent and Mastercard off 3.6 percent. So-called swipe fees paid to credit card companies each time a consumer uses a card for a purchase are a major expense for merchants who annually pay more than $50 billion to process such transactions. New York-based American Express charges merchants higher fees relative to the other credit card networks. The business model of American Express depends primarily on merchant fees, while competitors like Visa and MasterCard derive most of their revenues from interest on unpaid balances. American Express has said these fees fund the additional benefits it offers its cardholders compared to its rivals. The case involved an appeal by the 11 states - Iowa, Connecticut, Idaho, Illinois, Maryland, Michigan, Montana, Ohio, Rhode Island, Utah and Vermont - of a 2016 ruling by the New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that favored American Express. The states, backed by President Donald Trump’s administration, had argued that anti-steering provisions kept fees artificially high, leading to higher retail prices even for people who do not use credit cards. ‘LOSS FOR CONSUMERS’ The Retail Industry Leaders Association, which represents major retailers including Walmart Inc, Home Depot and Target Corp, said the decision will allow American Express to continue to prevent consumers from understanding rising credit card fees. “Today’s decision is a loss for American consumers,” the group’s general counsel Deborah White said. “Competition in the credit card space is sorely lacking.” American Express accounts for about 26 percent of all U.S. credit card transactions. “This was a long battle, but well worth the fight because important issues were at stake: consumer choice, fair market competition, and the ability to deliver innovative products and services to our customers, both consumers and merchants,” American Express Chief Executive Stephen Squeri said. As a result of advertising campaigns in the 1980s by Visa and MasterCard aimed at convincing merchants and consumers to use cards with lower fees, American Express tightened contract provisions with merchants to stop what it called discrimination against its cards. Writing for the court’s majority, Justice Clarence Thomas said in the “two-sided” market for credit card transactions, the states failed to show that the American Express system reduced the number of transactions or increased costs beyond a competitive level. Liberal Justice Stephen Breyer read his dissent from the bench, underscoring the seriousness of the issue. Antitrust laws protect the economy from monopolies, Breyer said. “I fear that today’s decision will weaken this protection by departing from basic, established antitrust principles,” Breyer added. The legal issue centered on how courts find antitrust violations where limits on competition for one side might offer benefits for the other. The decision could make it harder to find antitrust violations in markets in which businesses cater to two groups at the same time, in this case merchants and cardholders. That dynamic is common in other industries such as advertising and internet commerce, for example an online reservation platform used by both diners and restaurants. The case began in 2010 when the U.S. Justice Department, joined by a group of states, sued American Express claiming the anti-steering contract requirements prevent merchants from using competition to try to keep credit card fees from increasing. Visa and MasterCard settled similar lawsuits in 2010 by agreeing to change their rules. The Justice Department declined to comment on the ruling."

8.61765051854874," AmEx profit tops estimates as record splurge on rewards woos customers (Reuters) - Credit card issuer American Express Co AXP.N easily topped Wall Street targets for quarterly profit as record investments in card rewards and a strengthening U.S. economy contributed to higher customer spending. Shares of AmEx, which ended 1.4 percent higher on Wednesday, added another 3.5 percent in after-hours trading. New York-based AmEx spent a record $2.35 billion in customer rewards during the first three months of the year, seeking to woo more high-spending customers and counter competition from major U.S. banks. JPMorgan Chase JPM.N, Citigroup C.N and Bank of America BAC.N, which have all begun offering premium cards, each saw their card businesses grow in the first quarter. “Today’s results are showing good returns on the investments we’ve been making to drive growth in the premium sector,” AmEx Chief Executive Stephen Squeri said in a statement. Higher marketing expenses are the “table stakes” in the premium card category, analysts at Jefferies Group said last week, forecasting that industry-wide investments will continue to grow because of high competition. AmEx on Wednesday also said it expects 2018 earnings at the high end of its estimated range of its $6.90 to $7.30 per share. Analysts on average were expecting $7.11 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company said first-quarter card customer spending increased 3 percent in the United States and 7 percent worldwide. Consumer spending in the United States rose in January and February. AmEx’s net income rose to $1.63 billion or $1.86 per share in the quarter ended March 31, from $1.25 billion or $1.35 per share a year earlier. Analysts had expected earnings of $1.71 per share. Total revenue, net of interest expense, climbed 12 percent to $9.72 billion, topping analysts’ forecasts of $9.46 billion. AmEx is confident of resuming stock buybacks in the second half of 2018, Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey Campbell said on a call with analysts."
