CEO Vicki Hollub’s salary was restored to $1 million, effective Jan. 1, 2021, with the move coming at a time when U.S. crude prices have touched a year high and are near $60 per barrel. Hollub’s salary of $1.35 million was slashed by 81% in March, while the base salary of executives was capped at $250,000. In July, however, the company approved a partial restoration by capping salaries at $500,000 limit. Rival Pioneer Natural Resources reinstated its CEO’s pay in November. While oil and gas workers are still among the highest paid in the world, salaries in the sector are closely tied to oil prices, which plunged last year as coronavirus-induced lockdowns slashed demand for fuel.

106.89330120343226," Occidental Petroleum announces net-zero target for greenhouse gas emissions (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp OXY.N on Tuesday laid out a target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at its operations to net zero by 2040, becoming the latest oil and gas company to set long-term climate goals. Oil and gas producers, under pressure from investors who want to see the industry operate more cleanly, have announced new emissions targets this year even as they have slashed spending and production following a coronavirus-driven plunge in crude prices. Occidental will provide detail on its net-zero target by the end of November when it releases its sustainability report, Chief Executive Vicki Hollub said on an earnings call with analysts. Hollub touted an August announcement that a unit of Occidental would finance development of the largest ever facility to pull carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere through a process known as direct air capture. Carbon dioxide from the Permian Basin oil field will be stored underground and used to increase pressure in the oil field and speed up production. The project will lower Occidental’s oil recovery costs and allow it to partner with companies that need to lower their own carbon footprint, Hollub said. Royal Dutch Shell has laid out a strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. BP plans to increase its renewable power capacity 20-fold by 2030 while reducing its oil output by 40% and diverting more funds to low-carbon investments. Occidental’s direct air capture project will not require much investment in 2021, Hollub said. The producer will not spend more than $2.9 billion on new projects next year, an amount that would keep its oil and gas output flat. It posted a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss on Monday and has cut jobs and production this year, piling pressure on a company that took on significant debt to acquire Anadarko Petroleum for $38 billion last year.

Occidental has been forced to slash jobs, production and the value of its assets after the pandemic hammered energy demand, piling pressure on a company that had taken on significant debt to acquire Anadarko Petroleum for $38 billion last year. The oil producer, which announced in June it would restructure some debt to avoid a possible default, said its total long-term net debt stood at $35.9 billion at September-end, slightly lower than $36.03 billion at the end of June. The average price for the company’s crude oil plunged about 31.5% to $38.67 per barrel in the third quarter, while worldwide production from continuing operations rose 11.2% to 1.24 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd). Occidental said it expects production in the current quarter to be between 1.1 million boepd and 1.16 boepd, and reiterated its full-year spending plan of $2.4 billion to $2.6 billion. The company said it was adding four drilling rigs back to the Permian Basin, spread across Texas and New Mexico, and would have seven by year-end. Net loss attributable to stockholders widened to $3.8 billion, or $4.07 cents per share, in the third quarter, from $912 million, or $1.08 cents per share, a year earlier. The results included a one-time charge of about $2.4 billion related to its investment in Western Midstream Partners LP and $700 million of losses for some divestitures.

The cash-strapped company said it is continuing to advance other asset sales as it tries to find cash to pay off debt amid a crude price crash. It has so far announced over $2 billion worth of divestitures this year. The Colombia assets sale, expected to close in the fourth quarter, includes the company’s operations and working interests in the Llanos Norte, Middle Magdalena and Putumayo Basins.

54.81962017349172," Occidental to pay dividend to Buffett's Berkshire in cash, not stock NEW YORK (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp said on Monday it will pay a $200 million quarterly dividend to Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc in cash instead of common stock, even as the company tries to reduce debt following a plunge in oil prices. In a regulatory filing, Occidental said the payment on its perpetual preferred stock would be made on Oct. 15. Berkshire bought $10 billion of Occidental preferred stock in August 2019, helping fund the Houston-based company’s $35.7 billion acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum Corp. The preferred stock carries an 8% annual dividend. Occidental exercised its option to pay Berkshire’s two prior quarterly dividends in common stock. Berkshire disclosed last month it sold the stock comprising the first of these payouts. Occidental “has the ability to generate substantial free cash at current oil prices” to service near-term debts, Morningstar analyst David Meats said in an email. “As a result there’s no need to pay the preferred in stock, and the decision to do so earlier was probably due to abundance of caution at the outset of the pandemic and associated oil downturn.” Since March, Occidental has lowered capital spending, slashed its common stock dividend 98.7%, and pursued asset sales to conserve cash and reduce debt from the Anadarko purchase. The company agreed last month to sell some assets in Colorado, Utah and Wyoming to Orion Mine Finance for about $1.33 billion. Occidental ended June with $36 billion of long-term debt, down from $38.5 billion at year end. As of Friday, Occidental’s market value was about $11 billion, down from roughly $44 billion when it bought Anadarko. In afternoon trading, Occidental shares were down 43 cents at $11.22."

Occidental’s venture capital arm, Oxy Low Carbon Ventures LLC, has formed a company with sustainability-focused private equity firm Rusheen Capital Management LLC to license the direct air capture (DAC) technology developed by Canada’s Carbon Engineering. Interest in DAC has grown in recent years, from companies seeking to offset their climate impact to public officials worried about the slow pace of international agreements to cut emissions. The cost of carbon-removal technologies like DAC however is high, and they have yet to be deployed on a mass scale. Environmentalists have also argued that they reflect a lack of resolve to end the use of fossil fuels. The new company, 1PointFive, will develop a facility located on 100 acres in Texas’ Permian Basin. It aims to capture up to 1 million metric tons of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere a year, the companies said in a joint statement. Construction will begin in 2022, allowing time to improve plant design and reduce costs. The project will seek financing in the market. Carbon dioxide captured at the Texas facility will be stored underground and used to increase pressure in the oil field and speed up production. The project will benefit from a federal tax credit designed to spur investment in carbon capture and sequestration projects. Carbon Engineering has a pilot plant in British Columbia that has been operating since 2015. The United Nations has said carbon removal technology will be necessary to limit the increase in planetary warming to no more than 1.5 degrees Celsius, the goal of the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement."

The company has been struggling with debt taken on during its $38 billion acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum last year, an ill-timed bet on oil prices rising. The Anadarko purchase was intended to increase efficiency and profits by boosting oil and gas production. But Occidental’s output will dip in the third and fourth quarters and it will end the year pumping about 1.2 million barrels of oil and gas per day, roughly 200,000 barrels per day less than the year prior. The production outlook “does not inspire confidence in capital efficiency” or in the ability to “meet sustaining capital requirements next year,” Mizuho Securities USA analyst Vincent Lovaglio said, adding that Occidental needs to finalize a major asset sale. Occidental did not release 2021 spending plans, but said it would have to spend about $2.9 billion to keep production flat, based on oil prices at $40 per barrel. It has about $4.5 billion in notes due next year and reported long-term debt of $36 billion on June 30. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway holds about $9.7 billion in Occidental preferred shares that pay a dividend of about 8%.

-39.999599264164885," State of Wyoming to bid on Occidental Petroleum's land, minerals properties HOUSTON (Reuters) - The state of Wyoming will bid on a package of land and minerals in Wyoming and Colorado owned by troubled Occidental Petroleum Corp, public officials agreed on Monday. The company has been struggling with debt taken on in last year’s $38 billion acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum, an ill-timed bet on rising shale oil prices ahead of a market crash. Wyoming’s State Loan and Investment Board held a public hearing on Monday before voting unanimously to bid on the properties. If the state is successful in its bid, terms will be subject to approval by the board, which also voted to hold four public hearings on any potential purchase in locations throughout the state. Occidental acquired the land and minerals with its 2019 purchase of Anadarko. It is the largest private landowner in Wyoming, where it is focused mainly on development in the Powder River Basin. The sale includes about 1 million acres (405,000 hectares) of land and 4 million acres (1.6 million hectares) in mineral rights once owned by the federal government, sold to Union Pacific Railroad and later acquired by Anadarko. Several people complained during Monday’s hearing that the state had not been transparent about the process, but Patrick Fleming, chief investment officer for the Wyoming treasurer’s office, said it was not possible to say publicly what the state would bid. “It’s like playing poker. We’d have our cards facing everyone else,” Fleming said. State Auditor Kristi Racines said many felt “understandable frustration” and suggested the additional public hearings. Occidental declined to comment. It received 13 bids in the first round of its sales process, Chief Executive Vicki Hollub told analysts during a May 6 earnings call, adding the company expected to be able to close on that asset by early in the fourth quarter."

-44.82196006043459," Occidental signals writedown of up to $9 billion on bleak oil price outlook HOUSTON (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp OXY.N will write down the value of its oil and gas properties by up to $9 billion this quarter and restructure some debts to avoid a possible default, the company said on Thursday. The U.S. oil producer is trying to shed nearly $40 billion in debt from its purchase of rival Anadarko Petroleum last year, an ill-timed bet on rising oil prices ahead of a historic market crash. The latest writedown stems from declining energy demand amid the COVID-19 pandemic and global glut that has oil trading 38% below what it cost in January. Occidental and many of its peers dismissed workers and cut budgets by billions of dollars as energy markets fell. Occidental plans to replace $9.12 billion in notes due in 2021 and 2022 and issue new notes that would remove provisions that could have pushed it into default. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc BRKa.N, which last year bought $10 billion of Occidental preferred shares to help it finance the Anadarko deal, will receive a June 30 dividend in shares, Occidental said, to save cash. With its share price down 57% year to date, Occidental must pay the dividend with increasingly more stock, giving Berkshire a growing stake in the company, said Houston energy economist Ed Hirs. “There’s no clear horizon to anyone getting any value other than Buffett,” Hirs said. Occidental and Buffett were not immediately available for comment. Ratings firm Moody’s Investors Service on Thursday downgraded its rating on Occidental’s debt one notch to Ba2 and issued a “negative” outlook. Rival Fitch Ratings raised its rating on the notes to BB with a “stable” outlook. The Anadarko purchase left Occidental “with over $35 billion of debt and $10 billion of preferred stock, compromising its financial flexibility to confront the collapse in oil prices,” said Andrew Brooks, a Moody’s vice president. This will be the third consecutive quarter in which Occidental takes a writedown, bringing the total to as much as $12 billion in the last nine months, more than half of its market capitalization. The oil price crash has other oil and gas companies chopping the value of their assets. The industry’s total reductions could reach $300 billion starting this quarter, according to accounting and consulting firm Deloitte. Occidental recently set a July 1 deadline to accept bids for properties in Wyoming and Colorado that could bring up to $700 million. “So far the only successful divestitures were some of the LNG assets in Mozambique,” said Espen Erlingsen, an analyst at Rystad Energy. The company needs to complete asset sales, which remain “challenging in the current environment,” said Jennifer Rowland, analyst with Edward Jones. “They’ve put themselves in a tough situation and have a long way to go to get themselves back in a healthy position, especially if oil prices stay low for longer.” It cut its quarterly dividend last month to just a penny per share after having slashed it 86% in March to save cash."

The company has been struggling with debt taken on in last year’s $38 billion acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum, an ill-timed bet on rising shale oil prices ahead of a market crash. Wyoming’s State Lands and Investment Board plans to hold a public hearing early next week to decide if it will bid on the surface and mineral properties, Gordon said. Occidental is the largest private landowner in Wyoming, where it is focused mainly on development in the Powder River Basin. It acquired millions of mineral and surface acres in Wyoming and Colorado with the purchase of Anadarko last year, and hoped at one point to fetch as much as $700 million in the sale, according to people familiar with the offering. Occidental declined to comment on the bidding process. “I don’t think you often get opportunities like this, so it’s well worth our time to investigate,” Gordon, a Republican, said in an interview. The state is working with Barclays investment bank to determine the value of the properties and what sort of income it could receive from oil and gas development, mining, grazing, hunting, solar or wind development, or tourism, said Gordon. The decision on bidding will be based on likely investment returns, Gordon said, with money coming from the $7 billion Wyoming Permanent Mineral Trust Fund. Occidental received 13 bids in the first round of its sales process, Chief Executive Vicki Hollub told analysts during a May 6 earnings call, adding the company expected to be able to close on that asset late in the third quarter or early in the fourth quarter.

1.448238562770211," Occidental cuts dividend to a penny; shares dive 5% (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp cut its quarterly dividend to just a penny per share on Friday after having slashed it 86% in March to save cash after a historic plunge in oil prices. The oil and gas producer’s shares fell 5% to $12.95 and have lost nearly 70% of their value this year. Occidental has been struggling to cut a crushing debt load since its $38 billion purchase of rival Anadarko Petroleum last year, an ill-timed bet on rising oil prices. Occidental previously slashed its quarterly dividend to 11 cents a share from 79 cents, cut its 2020 spending budget nearly in half, and offered employees buyouts to save cash. Debt rating firm Gimme Credit this week ranked the company among its Bottom Ten, citing its lack of free cash flow despite dividend and spending cuts. Occidental, which reported more than $36 billion in debt at the end of March, faces “gigantic near term maturities,” wrote Gimme Credit’s Carol Levenson. On March 9, U.S. oil futures began a historic plunge. In April they actually closed one session in negative territory for the first time, as oil producing nations waged a price war and the coronavirus outbreak eroded demand. This year’s two dividend cuts will save about $2.7 billion a year. But the one-cent payout “will keep OXY in equity indices and portfolios that require a payout,” said Robert W.

-9.518071836886323," Occidental is sued by shareholders, bondholders over Anadarko merger NEW YORK (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp OXY.N has been sued by investors who claim they suffered billions of dollars of losses because the heavily indebted company concealed its inability to weather plunging oil prices, after paying $35.7 billion to acquire Anadarko Petroleum Corp. The proposed securities class action was filed late Tuesday in a New York state court in Manhattan on behalf of former Anadarko shareholders who swapped their stock for Occidental shares, and investors who acquired $24.5 billion of Occidental bonds that helped fund the August 2019 merger. Investors said Occidental should have disclosed in its stock and bond registration statements how quadrupling its debt load to $40 billion would leave it “precariously exposed” to falling oil prices, and undermine its ability to boost shale oil production and its common stock dividend. The investors also said Houston-based Occidental's issuance of $10 billion of preferred stock to Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc BRKa.N compounded the overleveraging. As of Tuesday, Occidental’s market value had dropped to $13 billion from about $44 billion when the merger closed. Some of Occidental’s new bonds traded at between 60 and 90.5 cents on the dollar. “Investors have suffered severe losses,” the complaint said. Occidental spokeswoman Melissa Schoeb declined to comment. Other defendants include Chief Executive Vicki Hollub, former Chief Financial Officer Cedric Burgher and several Occidental directors. Bank of America BAC.N, Citigroup C.N, JPMorgan JPM.N and Wells Fargo WFC.N, which helped underwrite Occidental's bonds, were also sued for alleged inadequate due diligence. Occidental has since early March slashed capital spending and salaries and lowered its dividend 86%, as reduced travel stemming from the coronavirus pandemic as well as a price war caused oil prices to tumble. The company lost $2.23 billion in the first quarter, and Hollub said Occidental may sell assets to raise money. She recently survived a proxy battle with activist investor Carl Icahn. The case is City of Sterling Heights General Employees’ Retirement System et al v Occidental Petroleum Corp et al, New York State Supreme Court, New York County."

The deal was part of an $8.8 billion agreement reached between Total and Occidental to over Anadarko’s assets in Mozambique, Ghana, Algeria, and South Africa. Occidental in 2019 decided to unload those assets as part of a $38 billion deal to buy Anadarko Petroleum that has soured due to the global downturn in fuel demand. While a deal over the assets in Mozambique has been reached, Total said that an agreement over the assets in Ghana fell through after authorities in Algiers blocked Total’s acquisition of Occidental’s assets in Algeria. The acquisition of assets in Ghana was conditional upon the completion of the Algeria asset sale, Total said. Algeria blocked Occidental’s deal to sell those assets earlier in the month. Total added that Occidental had informed the company that, as part of an understanding with the Algerian authorities, that Occidental would not be in a position to sell its interests in Algeria. “Given the extraordinary market environment and the lack of visibility that the group faces...

Occidental bet heavily on the continued growth in U.S. shale oil, taking on heavy debts for its controversial purchase of Anadarko Petroleum last year for $38 billion.

Occidental has been cutting expenses to deal with its debt-laden balance sheet and had been laying off workers and selling assets to pare down debt even before the fall in oil prices. The company said last week it is considering raising new cash, swapping debt for stock or refinancing existing debt due to shrinking oil demand. It withdrew its outlook for 2020. It cut its 2020 capex budget on three separate occasions this year, most recently to $2.5 billion from an original plan of $5.3 billion.

American restart * Occidental falls as it looks to raise cash, swap debt (Updates with close of U.S. markets) May 6 (Reuters) - The S&P 500 and the Dow fell on Wednesday after U.S. President Donald Trump cast doubt on a trade deal with China and data showed U.S. private employers laid off 20 million workers in April, underscoring the economic fallout of the coronavirus outbreak. The tech-heavy Nasdaq ended higher, although indexes pulled back late in the session after Trump said China may or may not keep the trade deal. Financials and other cyclical groups, which often outperform when the economic outlook improves, declined. Only two of the 11 major S&P sectors were positive, with tech leading. Stocks have rebounded sharply since late March from the coronavirus-fueled sell-off, helped by massive monetary and fiscal stimulus. Investors are now watching efforts by a number of states to spark their economies by easing restrictions put in place to fight the outbreak. “We had the dramatic drop, we have had this pretty dramatic rebound and to me it wouldn’t be unusual if for the next three, six months we had a pretty choppy, sloppy, back-and-forth market,” said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana. “Today might be a microcosm of that.” Unofficially, the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 218.45 points, or 0.91%, to 23,664.64, the S&P 500 lost 20.02 points, or 0.70%, to 2,848.42 and the Nasdaq Composite added 45.27 points, or 0.51%, to 8,854.39. U.S. private employers laid off a record 20.236 million workers in April as mandatory business closures in response to the novel coronavirus outbreak savaged the economy. The Labor Department’s more comprehensive report for April is due on Friday. “It’s one thing to talk about big job losses...but to see it all in one spot, I think that has been some reason for pause,” said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird in Milwaukee.

15.364782292977115," Occidental looks to raise cash, get debt under control HOUSTON (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp OXY.N said on Wednesday it is looking at a series of options to shore up its impaired balance sheet, including raising cash or refinancing debt, a day after posting a $2 billion loss. Energy companies worldwide, including Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N and Royal Dutch Shell PLC RDSa.L, have slashed capital expenditures and oil output to reckon with the collapse in fuel demand due to the coronavirus pandemic. Occidental faces additional challenges stemming from last year’s purchase of Anadarko Petroleum for $38 billion, a bet on continued growth of U.S. shale oil production. It shoulders about $40 billion in debt amid the worst oil-and-gas industry downturn in 40 years. The U.S. oil producer’s shares fell 10% on Wednesday, and are down 68% so far this year, making it the worst performing energy stock in the Standard & Poor’s 500 index in 2020. Asset sales planned to reduce debt from the Anadarko acquisition in Africa have been sidetracked, and it soon may be forced to cut the value of those and other properties due to the crash. The company is “increasingly challenged to manage its significant debt burden” and production likely will drop more than 10% by year end, said Jennifer Rowland, an analyst with Edward Jones. Robert Peterson, Occidental’s finance chief, said in a conference call on Wednesday the company is considering raising new cash, swapping debt for stock and refinancing existing debt because of collapsing oil demand. Occidental also withdrew its 2020 outlook. When an analyst asked if refinancing markets were available to the company, Peterson said, “Absolutely.” The company expects to book $2 billion from asset sales in the near term, Chief Executive Vicki Hollub said, adding that it could sell some assets or do oil joint ventures in its Permian Basin or Rocky Mountains properties to raise money. Future stock-for-debt swaps or use of stock to pay preferred dividends to Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc BRKa.N, which helped Occidental finance the purchase of Anadarko, could cause an ownership change under Internal Revenue Service rules, it said in a securities filing. The book value of $44 billion in oil-and-gas properties it acquired could be reduced this quarter due to the decline in oil prices, it also said. They include Anadarko properties acquired when U.S. oil CLc1 was selling at $51 a barrel; it is now at about $24. Occidental hired investment bankers Moelis & Co to advise on its debt, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday. While the bulk of that debt comes due beginning next year, it may face a $992 million call in October from noteholders, according to Wednesday’s securities filing. A planned sale of its Algerian oil and gas properties to France's Total SA TOTF.PA was canceled. Occidental will have to reclassify those as continuing operations, which could hurt second-quarter results, Rowland said. It is pursuing a sale of other assets in Ghana, a deal that had been held up, but that the transaction now is riskier in the current environment, Hollub said."

15.364782292977115," Occidental looks to raise cash, swap debt as oil prices pressure finances HOUSTON, May 6 (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp said on Wednesday it was looking to raise new cash or swap debt for stock, a day after it posted a large first-quarter loss, sending its stock down 7%. Shares fell to $14.23 after the company laid out in a securities filing the potential for new asset impairments and an ownership change based on its need to raise new cash to cover future debt payments. Wednesday’s drop pushed its shares down about 65% this year. Robert Peterson, the company’s finance chief, said in a conference call on Wednesday it is considering raising new cash, swapping debt for stock and refinancing existing debt because of collapsing oil demand. Occidental also withdrew its 2020 outlook. Future debt-for-stock swaps or use of stock to pay preferred dividends could cause an ownership change under Internal Revenue Service rules, it said in a securities filing.

The value of about $44 billion in acquired oil and gas properties may be reduced due to the decline in oil prices, it also said in a securities filing.

The planned sale of its Algerian oil and gas properties to France’s Total SA will not go forward, both companies said this week. Occidental will have to reclassify those as continuing operations, which could hurt second-quarter results, Rowland said. The Anadarko purchase increased Occidental’s debt to about $40 billion, and the oil-price crash has cut the value of assets picked up in the deal, making it harder to sell some of them to pay down the debt."
4.106781299695459," Occidental posts $2.2 billion loss on charges, deepens spending cuts HOUSTON (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp on Tuesday swung to a first quarter loss on writedowns and charges, and the troubled U.S. oil producer cut its budget for the third time since March in response to a historic oil-price crash. The company has been struggling with debt taken on in last year’s $38 billion acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum, an ill-timed bet on rising shale oil prices ahead of a market dive. Global energy demand has tumbled amid coronavirus-related travel and business restrictions and a glut of oil from a price war. U.S. crude collapsed this year, and remains down about 60% from January despite a recent rally. Occidental’s results included a $1.4 billion impairment charge on its Western Midstream pipeline assets, a $580 million writedown of oil and gas properties and $670 million loss on interest-rate swaps. The losses were partially offset by a $1 billion gain on crude oil hedges. The company cut its 2020 project budget for a third time, to about $2.5 billion, from the original roughly $5.3 billion plan. It identified an additional $1.2 billion in operating and overhead cost cuts, it said on Tuesday. Occidental is “taking aggressive action to ensure our long-term financial stability,” Chief Executive Officer Vicki Hollub said. The company reported a net loss of $2.23 billion, or $2.49 per share, for the quarter ended March 31, compared with a profit of $631 million, or 84 cents per share, in the year-ago period. Occidental beat Wall Street estimates for adjusted earnings. Analysts expected an adjusted loss of 63 cents, but the company reported a loss of 52 cents, according to Refinitiv. The Anadarko purchase saddled Occidental with $40 billion in debt and the oil-price crash has cut the value of assets Occidental picked up in the deal, dashing its hopes of selling some of them to pay down the debt. French oil giant Total SA on Tuesday said it had been told by Occidental it cannot acquire Occidental’s oil and gas assets in Algeria, which were part of an $8.8 billion deal reached by the companies on Anadarko’s assets in Africa. Berkshire Hathaway Inc Chairman Warren Buffett, who helped bankroll the Anadarko purchase, on Saturday said the investment was conditioned on much higher oil prices. “It does not work at $20 a barrel,” said Buffett. Shares edged 1.3% lower to close at $15.32 on Tuesday, down 64% year-to-date. In March, Occidental agreed to take three directors nominated by activist investor Carl Icahn, who had opposed the Anadarko deal. The company will hold a call with analysts on Wednesday morning to discuss the results."

19.511069886810155," Occidental shareholders get first say on Anadarko deal with vote on Berkshire financing HOUSTON (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum shareholders next month will get their first say on the oil company’s troubled acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum when they vote on issuing shares and warrants to Berkshire Hathaway for helping finance the $38 billion deal. The Anadarko acquisition closed in August, months before an oil price crash sapped the cash flow Occidental needed to pay the debt taken with the purchase. Critics, including activist shareholder Carl Icahn, have said the financing deal with Berkshire Hathaway’s Warren Buffett was too generous. Occidental and Berkshire Hathaway declined to comment. Berkshire Hathaway’s $10 billion investment provided it with warrants for 80 million common shares in addition to an 8% dividend on preferred shares received for its support for the Anadarko Petroleum acquisition. Shareholders, who did not get to vote on the Anadarko deal last year, will vote at Occidental's May 29 annual meeting to authorize the warrants and to issue 400 million new shares, some of which could pay the Berkshire dividend. tinyurl.com/ybf9dmtq Shareholders could voice disapproval of the Anadarko deal by not voting in favor of the proposals, said Jennifer Rowland, analyst with Edward Jones. But Occidental needs the high number of authorized shares to pay the preferred dividend and some employee compensation, “as they need to preserve as much cash as possible,” Rowland added. Cash-strapped Occidental recently paid Berkshire its first quarter dividend with about 17.3 million shares, which are trading at a fifth of what they fetched last year. When paid in shares, the dividend increases to nearly 9%. Berkshire’s warrants are nearly worthless, because their $62.50 strike price is well above Occidental’s $13.63 closing price on Friday. But they give Berkshire more than a decade to exercise the option, and dividends paid in shares could make it a major holder in short order. The Anadarko acquisition was a bet on rising shale oil prices months ahead of the worst price crash in decades. The purchase saddled Occidental with $40 billion in debt and the oil-price crash has cut the value of assets that Occidental picked up in the deal, dashing its hopes of selling them to pay down the debt. U.S. oil prices have fallen below $20 per barrel from $61 at the start of the year. Chief Executive Vicki Hollub’s base pay for 2020 was cut 81%, according to a Friday filing, as the board capped the salaries of named officers at $250,000. Her base salary in 2019 was $1.33 million. Hollub had $4.4 million in realized compensation last year, as the value of stock awards - worth $10.5 million during 2019 - tumbled with the company’s share price. Pay for non-employee board members also was cut 15% recently due to “the sudden and significant decline in global commodity prices,” the filing said."

Global oil prices have dropped 60% since January as fuel supply piles up because of the coronavirus pandemic that threatens to cause a global recession and as Saudi Arabia and Russia plan to pump more oil to grab market share. Globally-traded brent crude was down 2.5% at $26.48 on Wednesday. Occidental now plans to spend about $2.8 billion on production in 2020, almost half its original budget of about $5.3 billion. Oil and gas production will fall about 6% below a prior forecast, and salary and other expense cuts will save the firm another $600 million this year, the company said. Some of Occidental’s U.S. workers will have their pay cut by 30% and others, including those covered by the Anadarko acquisition agreement, will see smaller cuts, according to a memo reviewed by Reuters. Chief executive officer Vicki Hollub, who championed the company’s ill-timed $38 billion Anadarko acquisition, will take a pay cut of 81%. Salaries of other top executives will be reduced by an average of 68%, according to the memo. “We now expect to significantly lower our costs in all aspects of the business,” Hollub said in a statement, adding the company “will continue to take actions as necessary to further strengthen our balance sheet and ensure the long-term viability of our business.” The company said it expects the latest round of cuts to lower domestic operating costs to $7 per barrel of oil equivalent (BOE). Occidental had already pared spending and cut its shareholder dividend by 86% earlier this month. It has also dismissed staff and sold assets to avoid being overwhelmed by the debt taken on to pay for the Anadarko deal.

Global oil prices have dropped 60% since January as fuel demand has plunged because of the coronavirus pandemic that threatens to cause a global recession and as Saudi Arabia and Russia plan to increase supply to grab market share. Occidental has pared spending on production, cut its shareholder dividend, dismissed staff and sold assets to avoid being overwhelmed by the debt taken on to pay for its $38 billion acquisition of rival Anadarko Petroleum. The deal was an ill-timed bet on rising oil prices that soured within months of the deal’s closing. Crude oil traded at $27.64 a barrel Wednesday morning in Asia, below the level that Occidental recently said it needs to cover expenses. “During this unprecedented time impacting our industry, and the global economy, we’re taking aggressive actions to ensure the health of the company while protecting jobs,” company spokeswoman Melissa Schoeb said in a statement. “We notified our employees of a number of measures we will be implementing, including compensation reductions, which will impact everyone at the company starting with the management team,” she wrote. Occidental will cut the salaries for some U.S. employees who earn more than $76,000 a year by up to 30% effective April 1, according to the memo and employee comments on website thelayoff.com discussing the salary cuts. The pay of Chief Executive Vicki Hollub, who championed the Anadarko acquisition and convinced Berkshire Hathaway Chairman Warren Buffett to invest $10 billion in the deal, will fall 81%. Salaries of other top executives will be reduced by an average of 68%, the memo said. Some workers who joined the company from Anadarko and are protected by terms of the acquisition agreement, will see their salaries lowered by 4.9%. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported on the pay cuts. The reductions follow two cuts to its 2020 capital budget and an 86% reduction in its shareholder payout. After those cuts, the company said it would be able to cover its expenses with oil in the low-$30 a barrel range. Still, Moody’s Investors Service dropped Occidental’s debt rating to non-investment grade last week, warning the rating could be lowered further.

The agreement could put an end to a bitter fight over Occidental’s ill-timed purchase of rival Anadarko Petroleum last year, a bet on the continued growth of U.S. shale. After closing that deal, the market turned against Occidental, with oil prices diving more than 60% this year as the global coronavirus outbreak cut oil demand and OPEC and Russia launched an oil-price war. If the settlement talks conclude successfully, Icahn associates Andrew Langham and Nicholas Graziano would get board seats, and Icahn would have a say in the naming of a third independent director, the source said. An announcement could come later this week, alongside an official announcement on the appointment of former Occidental CEO Stephen Chazen as Occidental’s new chairman, the source said. The Wall Street Journal on.wsj.com/3bfiRQE was the first to report that Occidental was nearing a truce in the proxy fight with Icahn. The oil price collapse has left Occidental with about $40 billion in debt and dwindling means of covering operating expenses. This month it slashed its shareholder dividend and unveiled a new round of spending cuts. The U.S. oil producer’s market value fell to $9.16 billion on Friday, far below the $38 billion it paid last August for Anadarko. Equity researcher Evercore ISI on Thursday cut its forecast for the company to a $3-a-share loss this year, from no profit previously.

82.09905585063917," Moody's downgrades Occidental Petroleum's debt rating to 'junk' March 18 (Reuters) - Moody’s Investors Service on Wednesday downgraded the debt rating of U.S. oil and gas producer Occidental Petroleum Corp to “junk” status, flagging credit challenges ahead for the energy company following a crash in oil and gas prices. Moody’s cut its rating on Occidental’s senior unsecured debt to “Ba1” from “Baa3”, a week after the company slashed its shareholder dividend and further cut its spending and production outlook for 2020. The acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum Corp continues to burden Occidental’s balance sheet, “significantly compromising its financial flexibility to confront the collapse in oil prices,” said Andrew Brooks, vice president at Moody’s. Occidental took on $40 billion in debt from its purchase of Anadarko last year, with the deal running into a fiscal hurricane as oil prices crashed below $30 a barrel after Russia and Saudi Arabia sparked a price war earlier this year. “Projected asset sales required for debt reduction have slowed and face considerable headwinds in a challenged oil and natural gas price environment, leaving OXY with a significantly weakened credit profile whose prospects for near-term improvement are uncertain,” Brooks added. In a statement released on Wednesday, the ratings agency said it is lowering Occidental’s senior unsecured shelf rating to (P)Ba1 from (P)Baa3 and its commercial paper program rating to Not Prime from Prime-3. Last week, the world’s top rating agencies warned that the sharp drop in oil prices, if sustained, could cause a wave of sovereign downgrades and heavy multi-notch rating cuts to junk-rated oil and gas firms. Meanwhile, the coronavirus pandemic has further pressured fuel prices, cutting demand for oil and gas at a time when global supplies are rising as OPEC and Russia pump out more to regain market share from U.S. shale. On Wednesday, U.S. crude futures slumped more than 20% and settled at $20.47 per barrel, an 18-year low, as governments worldwide accelerated lockdowns to counter the pandemic.

29.808107051774122," Occidental tries to head off investor Icahn as he amasses shares (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum OXY.N said on Friday it will move to stop investors from amassing more than a 15% stake in a move aimed at activist investor Carl Icahn, who has been buying up shares and stepping up criticism of the oil producer's $38 billion purchase of Anadarko Petroleum last year. This week’s slump in oil prices has crystallized the problems facing Occidental, which took on debt to buy Anadarko in a bet that U.S. shale production would keep rising and crude prices would remain high. Earlier this week, Occidental slashed its dividend by 86% and said it would cut spending by 30%. Occidental said on Friday it will issue a shareholder rights offering, often known as a “poison pill” because it is designed to discourage takeovers by diluting the ownership interest of a hostile party. Icahn now owns nearly 10% of the company’s stock, he said this week, and has been agitating for changes to Oxy’s board following the Anadarko deal. Occidental’s dividend cut was its first in 19 years, and the company’s market value is now just over $10 billion, compared with a value of roughly $80 billion when the deal was announced in April of last year. That has given Icahn more ammunition to aim at the board. “It’s time for Oxy CEO and board to be held accountable,” Icahn said in an interview with CNBC on Friday. Icahn bought about 88.6 million shares for $2.21 billion, raising his stake in Occidental to nearly 10% from 2.53% at the end of last year, an SEC filing on Thursday showed. He has repeatedly called upon Occidental to disclose if it had received any takeover offers while looking to buy Anadarko. The rights offering would issue one right for each share outstanding at the close of March 23, exercisable if a person or group acquires at least 15% of the company’s shares, or if passive institutional investors buy 20% of the oil producer. The rights plan has to be approved at the 2020 annual meeting, the company said. Occidental’s market value plunged to $10.6 billion as of Thursday’s close, less than a third of what it paid for Anadarko and its debt has ballooned to about $40 billion. U.S. crude fell to roughly $32 a barrel on Friday, down about 20% on the week as the coronavirus outbreak threatened demand and crude producers promised more supply. [O/R]"

44.76987055771547," Occidental slashes dividend and spending as oil prices crash HOUSTON/BENGALURU (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp on Tuesday slashed its shareholder dividend and unveiled a new round of spending cuts, a day after a collapse in U.S. crude prices to near $30 a barrel fed investor worries about its heavy debt load and shrinking cash flow. Shares rose 14.6% on Tuesday to $14.34 after the cuts were disclosed. On Monday, the U.S. oil producer’s market value fell to $12 billion, less than a third of the $38 billion it paid last August for rival Anadarko Petroleum, an ill-timed bet on continued growth of U.S. shale. That deal ran into a fiscal hurricane with oil prices diving as much as 42% this year. OPEC and Russia launched an oil-price war over the weekend to regain market share from U.S. shale. The oil price collapse left Occidental with about $40 billion in debt and dwindling means of covering operating expenses after the $2.8 billion dividend and interest costs. The reduced dividend on common shares and as much as $1.9 billion in new spending cuts will save the company a combined $4.1 billion to $4.3 billion a year. With the cuts, Occidental can finance its expenses with oil in the low-$30 a barrel range, Chief Executive Vicki Hollub said in a statement. Global benchmark Brent crude was trading around $37 a barrel on Tuesday, with U.S. crude below $35 a barrel. “I’m not surprised about the dividend cut because she has broken her pledges so many times in the past,” said activist investor Carl Icahn, who has been waging a bitter battle against Occidental. Icahn, who held about 22.6 million Occidental shares at end of 2019, has criticized the deal as a misplaced bet on oil prices rising and has promised a proxy fight to win control of the company. He told Reuters he was glad Hollub had not been replaced, saying: “if they fired her the stock would have gone up considerably, and I’ve been thinking of buying.” Occidental declined to make Hollub available for an interview. Less than two weeks ago, she had called the dividend “one of the defining characteristics of our company,” and pledged to defend it. Occidental last cut its dividend in 1991. “We were dumbstruck by today’s announcement,” said Occidental investor David Katz, president of Matrix Asset Advisors, who also wants to see board and management changes at Occidental. The company has about 40% of this year’s production hedged, but “folded two days after oil prices sold off,” Katz said. The company did not say how much its oil and gas production would be affected by the spending cuts. Occidental pumps about 1.4 million barrels of oil and gas per day, but could see “a low-to-mid single digit production decline over the next 12 months,” said Pavel Molchanov, analyst with Raymond James. An Occidental spokesman declined to say whether the company has approached Berkshire Hathaway’s Warren Buffett, who holds $10 billion in Occidental preferred shares, about the dividend cut or forbearance on its payments. Occidental slashed the common stock dividend to 44 cents a share annually from $3.16 a share, after investors called for a cut, according to a person familiar with the matter. The savings “should help stabilize the company in the medium to long term, said Matt Portillo, an analyst with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. He said even with the cuts, Occidental’s high debt remains the “overriding concern.” The company said its latest cuts will bring 2020 capital spending down about 60% from last year, to between $3.5 and $3.7 billion. It will implement additional cost-cutting measures."

-57.07595417674077," Occidental Petroleum could cut 2020 spending on coronavirus impact (Reuters) - After already slashing spending on new projects by 40%, Occidental Petroleum Corp is ready to cut deeper this year if oil markets continue to be roiled by global coronavirus fears, Chief Executive Vicki Hollub said on Friday. The U.S. oil and gas producer is under pressure to generate enough cash to cover its capital spending and a nearly 10% shareholder dividend after completing a widely panned, $38 billion acquisition of a rival. Investor Carl Icahn criticized the deal as overpriced and is leading a fight to replace the board over the deal. U.S. crude prices have fallen about 27% this year and Occidental’s share price is down nearly 52% since the day before its interest in Anadarko Petroleum first became known last year. “As global commodity prices have declined sharply in recent days, we are prepared to reduce our spending if the current environment does not improve,” Hollub said on a call with analysts. “We are monitoring the situation closely and retain the flexibility to adjust our budget if needed.” Occidental plans to spend between $5.2 billion and $5.4 billion this year. Calling dividends “one of the defining characteristics” of the company, Hollub said it has hedged a large part of its production and would not take on additional debt. If oil prices remain in the mid-to-high $40 a barrel range, management would need to cut Occidental’s budget by more than $1 billion to live within cash flow after paying dividends, Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co analysts said. “The more prudent move would be to cut the dividend to give the company breathing room given the leverage profile,” the brokerage said. Occidental said it has built scenarios to deal with the coronavirus outbreak and could even allow production to fall “a little bit” if crude prices stayed low. The company has been aggressively cutting costs by laying off staff and selling assets to pay down its $38.54 billion debt pile following its acquisition of Anadarko. On an adjusted basis, the company posted a fourth-quarter loss of 30 cents per share, much larger than the 19 cent loss analysts had expected, partly due to higher interest expense. It also took more than $1.7 billion in impairment and other charges in the quarter.

The Anadarko deal was an enormous bet on the shale boom continuing and Occidental’s ability to find ready buyers for unwanted assets. However, the plan has since run headlong into falling oil and natural gas prices and a dearth of buyers. Occidental has had to slash costs, cut jobs and pull back on expansion plans to show investors it would fully protect its dividend. The company told investors it would produce more oil and gas this year even with lower spending, sending its shares up 3.8%. However, the stock is still down 31% since the company’s interest in Anadarko became public.

The charges include about $1 billion associated with the Western Midstream stake sale and $655 million related to severance, integration and other costs stemming from the Anadarko deal. In January, Occidental announced plans to lower its stake in pipeline operator Western Midstream to below 50% this year. The charges are expected to be partly offset by a $475 million gain from the formation of a U.S. shale drilling joint venture with Colombia’s state-run oil company Ecopetrol SA and a $84 million gain on derivatives, the company said on Tuesday.

-66.08429383268721," The real price of Occidental's 'costless' oil hedge (Reuters) - In just 12 days, Occidental Petroleum Corp pulled off one of the biggest hedges against falling oil prices ever placed by a U.S. energy company. It characterized the transaction as “costless” but a Reuters review of regulatory filings, market data and interviews shows that’s not the whole story. The aim of the complex financial maneuver, the company said, was to help preserve Occidental’s generous dividend to shareholders as it sought to take over rival Anadarko Petroleum for $38 billion last summer in the biggest industry deal for years. “With the additional leverage from the Anadarko acquisition, these new hedges will strengthen our 2020 cash flow in a low oil price environment, and provide additional assurance that our dividend is safe, while we are deleveraging,” Occidental’s Chief Financial Officer Cedric Burgher told an earnings call in August. However, to secure the hedge swiftly and discreetly and to avoid paying its bankers a fee for arranging it, the company took a bigger potential hit to future revenues with only limited protection against falling oil prices, according to a source with direct knowledge of the transaction. While Occidental disclosed the financial details of the hedge in filings, fulfilling its regulatory obligations, the fact that the company took on the additional risk to secure the transaction fast and to avoid banker fees has not been previously reported. Occidental declined to comment for this story. Hedges are used by a variety of companies. Airlines use them to protect against rising fuel prices and energy producers use them to lock in revenue, usually by buying a put option, a type of derivative contract, which gives them the right to sell oil at a predetermined future price. Occidental used a complex series of transactions for its hedge, which was arranged by Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citigroup, according to six sources with direct knowledge of the trades. The summer hedge covered nearly 110 million barrels of oil, or 300,000 barrels a day, each for 2020 and 2021, nearly enough to meet the annual oil imports of Australia. Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citigroup declined to comment. For a graphic on how the hedge was executed, click on [tmsnrt.rs/35L1B3p]. The hedge meant the firm could sell the oil at a minimum of $55 a barrel in 2020, even if crude prices fell below that, to a limit of $45 a barrel; but the company’s selling price was capped at $74.09, and it would lose out on any revenue earned from oil prices rising beyond that mark. Occidental capped revenues for 2020 and also 2021 but only got downside protection for 2020 - a lopsided deal sometimes referred to as a naked hedge. Limiting future revenue without getting a guarantee against falling prices is unusual in the energy sector. While Occidental has disclosed the details of the 2020 hedge in regulatory filings, the absence of a hedge against falling oil prices in 2021 was not explicitly mentioned. The company said the 2021 options were meant to increase the maximum selling price it would receive for 2020 sales. “Occidental entered into the 2021 call options to substantially improve the ceiling price that the Company will receive for the contracted commodity volumes in 2020,” it said in a filing. Some analysts said investors should have been given more information about the potential implications of the hedge. “It seems very strange that they left a naked hedge in 2021 which capped upside but offered no downside protection,” said David Katz, president and CIO of Matrix Asset Advisors, which owns 0.3% of Occidental’s shares. However, other analysts said Occidental needed to secure a hedge quickly to defuse some of the pressure from investors. “Doing this gives Oxy a lot of flexibility in 2020 with cash flow,” said Trisha Curtis, President of PetroNerds, an energy analytics and advisory firm specializing in U.S. shale. “You can’t have an acquisition that big and then willy-nilly hope that oil prices hold up. Regardless of what it cost them, it was needed for a number of reasons.” (GRAPHIC: Breaking down Occidental's hedge - ) Occidental has said publicly that it does not regularly hedge its oil sales because it does not want to give up potential revenue. The last time the company hedged was in 2005, also following an acquisition. In the summer of 2019, Occidental was under pressure to demonstrate that its dividend was being protected. Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn was campaigning against the Anadarko deal and Anadarko itself had issued a regulatory filing on July 29 saying its calculations showed that Occidental, even without an acquisition, would not be able to generate enough cash to pay its dividend for the next three years. Occidental executives wanted to be able to announce the hedge to reassure investors when they presented second-quarter results on July 31, according to three sources with direct knowledge of the transaction. Bank of America and Citigroup had been advising Occidental on the Anadarko acquisition. Now their traders had about two weeks to complete the hedge. Acting on Occidental’s behalf, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citigroup sold two types of derivative contracts, with the intention of using the proceeds from the sales to fund the purchase of a put option locking in Occidental’s oil revenues at $55 a barrel for 2020, according to the six sources. In illiquid private markets, big transactions are more difficult, and therefore more expensive, to execute. If rival traders get wind of a deal before it is fully executed, they could get in first with their own buy or sell orders, pushing up or down the target price. In the case of Occidental’s hedge, the large volume of oil and the tight time frame to insure it meant the banks were not going to be able to raise enough money from selling derivative contracts for 2020 alone to cover the cost of the hedge, the first source said. To fill the gap and avoid having to present Occidental with a large bill, the banks sold similar revenue-limiting options for 2021, the source said. Selling the 2021 options also increased the amount of money the banks could make because they were selling additional contracts on Occidental’s behalf. Derivatives trades require only minimal disclosure and it is unclear how much of a profit the banks made from the Occidental deal. Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citigroup declined to comment. In the first week of 2020, international oil prices spiked by around 9% to nearly $72 a barrel due to heightened tensions in the Middle East. They have since fallen back to around $65, $2 above the price they are expected to average out at over 2020, according to the most recent Reuters poll. If those expectations pan out, Occidental will not miss out on potential profits, so the bet would work out. On the other hand, if oil prices were to surge again, and remain above $74 a barrel, the cost to Occidental could translate to millions of dollars a month in lost revenues, even at just $1 above the price cap. Despite the hedge underpinning its dividend, Occidental shares have fallen by nearly a third since April, when its interest in Anadarko first became public."

The company has already “significantly” cut staff through a voluntary program, spokeswoman Melissa Schoeb said in an email. She did not respond to requests for information about the number of employees to be cut or any potential charge to earnings. The combined company had about 16,000 workers when it merged. Occidental has been selling assets and cutting costs since it outbid Chevron Corp last year for Anadarko, quadrupling its debt to $40 billion. In November it said it planned to slash spending by about $3.6 billion this year, or by 40% of the 2019 total, and trim production goals to meet dividend and debt payments. It reported a third-quarter net loss of $912 million compared with a profit of $1.87 billion the year prior. The loss included nearly $1.3 billion in pretax acquisition costs and impairment charges. On Monday it said it would cut its majority stake in pipeline operator Western Midstream Partners LP to less than 50% this year, which would reduce the debt Occidental shows on its books and make it easier to sell or spin off the business. Occidental had long-term debt of $47.6 billion at the end of September. “Occidental’s integration team identified the jobs we need to successfully and safely operate our business and achieve our synergy goals,” Schoeb said.

Hollub still faces a proxy battle by activist investor Carl Icahn, who wants to replace the company’s board and have it accelerate asset sales or put itself on the market. Occidental has raised about $10 billion so far through sales of properties including a liquefied natural gas project in Mozambique and production in Africa. It recently agreed to sell Anadarko’s former headquarters and a Houston office complex for $565 million to real estate developer Howard Hughes Corp."

-69.26243368698745," Occidental to cut Western Midstream stake to reduce debt (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp OXY.N said on Monday it would cut its majority stake in pipeline operator Western Midstream Partners LP WES.N to less than 50% in 2020, to reduce its debt that grew significantly with the Anadarko Petroleum Corp deal. Occidental’s shares rose about 4% on the news, having lost over 30% in value since the $38-billion offer for Anadarko was made public on April 24, 2019. Occidental is working to pare $40 billion of debt it took on with the Anadarko deal, and changes to ownership would ease a sale or spin-off of Western Midstream. The restructuring would also allow Occidental to no longer show the gas pipeline and processing business’s debt as its own. The net long-term debt for Occidental was $47.6 billion as of Sept. 31, 2019. The deal, which has been called “hugely overpriced” by activist investor Carl Icahn, continues to weigh on Occidental’s shares, which still trade at levels it touched during the financial downturn of 2008. Inherited as part of the Anadarko takeover, the sale of the Western Midstream stake is a key part of Occidental’s target to raise a total of $15 billion from asset sales by mid-2020. Occidental has raised about $10.5 billion through sales of properties, including a liquefied natural gas project in Mozambique and oil production elsewhere in Africa. Western Midstream currently trades at a market value of over $9 billion. The restructuring of the Western Midstream agreements will put Occidental back on track to hive off the business, something it tried to do unsuccessfully last year. “I don’t view the plans to reduce its ownership level to below 50% in 2020 as surprising. It’s likely just a first step towards monetizing more of its ownership position over time,” said Jennifer Rowland, an analyst with Edward Jones. Occidental on Sunday gave up over 9 million shares, or a 2% stake in Western Midstream's general partner, and allowed limited partners to remove Occidental and appoint a new general partner. (bit.ly/39Nbnoi) Occidental fully owns the general partner stake, which effectively controls Western Midstream, a master limited partnership, and around 55% of the pipeline operator’s limited partner units.

-69.2870006485201," U.S. oil deals hit five-year high in 2019 on Occidental's blockbuster Anadarko buy (Reuters) - The value of U.S. oil and gas mergers and acquisitions reached a five-year peak of $96 billion in 2019 on the back of competing bids for Anadarko Petroleum, energy data provider Enverus said on Thursday. Occidental Petroleum Corp's OXY.N $38 billion acquisition of Permian rival Anadarko countered a pullback in corporate deal-making the sector, driven by investor pressure to prioritize shareholder returns over growth, Enverus said. Occidental last year won a takeover battle for Anadarko, topping Chevron Corp's CVX.N $33 billion offer, after Berkshire Hathaway Inc's BRKa.N Warren Buffett and France's Total SA TOTF.PA came to its aid. Without that acquisition, the total value of deals in 2019 would have been $39.1 billion, well below the $85 billion recorded in 2018, according to Enverus. The data provider valued the Anadarko deal at $57 billion, including debt taken on by the acquirer. “Investors who funded the shale revolution over the last decade have become vocal in advocating for payouts and cut back on providing new capital. That flowed through to limited M&A and a negative reaction to deals for much of the year,” said Andrew Dittmar, senior M&A analyst at Enverus. However, the total M&A spend in 2019 was the highest since 2014, when oil prices peaked at $112 per barrel before beginning a slump that saw prices drop by half of that. Most of the last year’s marquee deals focused on the Permian basin of Texas and New Mexico, which is at the heart of the shale boom that has helped the United States become the world’s biggest producer of crude oil. Enverus predicts M&A would rise this year, after ticking up in the fourth quarter of 2019, as smaller players with good land but less access to capital are gobbled up by those with free cash flow. Apart from Occidental-Anadarko, 2019's largest corporate deals in the sector were Callon Petroleum Co's CPE.N $2.7 billion merger with Carrizo Oil & Gas Inc, WPX Energy Inc's WPX.N $2.5 billion buy of Felix Energy, and Parsley Energy Inc's PE.N $2.3 billion acquisition of Jagged Peak Energy JAG.N."

Mohamed Arkab said the deal, part of a wider sale of Anadarko assets to Total after its acquisition by Occidental this year, was “incompatible” with Algerian legislation. Sonatrach would implement its “pre-emption right” to block the deal, Arkab told APS. Occidental bought Andarko Petroleum this year. As part of the deal it agreed to sell Anadarko’s assets in Algeria, Ghana, Mozambique and South Africa to Total for $8.8 billion. Its Algerian assets had production of around 260,000 barrels a day, about a quarter of the North African country’s total crude output. Algeria’s parliament has passed a new energy law that encourages international investment in its oil and gas sector while keeping a bar on majority foreign ownership of hydrocarbons projects. The law is aimed at boosting production of oil and gas, a key source of revenue, which has been falling. However, any involvement in the sector by former colonial power France is controversial in Algeria. Protesters who have been demonstrating in huge numbers since February for a change in the ruling hierarchy have also marched against the new energy law and chanted slogans opposing Total’s involvement in Algeria."

Icahn sued Occidental in Delaware Court of Chancery last May seeking financial records and details of its negotiations with Anadarko. He has since committed to a proxy fight to appoint new management and accelerate asset sales to repay debt taken on with the $38 billion deal. In a sharply worded decision, Vice Chancellor Joseph Slights wrote Icahn’s complaints of Occidental mismanagement “appear to be nothing more than disagreements” with the company’s directors and his lawsuit failed to show how the documents would advance his proxy contest. “We intend to appeal his decision because we believe understanding what happened in the Oxy boardroom is very important to our proxy fight and for all stockholders,” said Andrew Langham, general counsel for Icahn Enterprises. Occidental did not respond to requests for comment. Icahn last week disclosed the sale of 10 million shares of the oil and gas producer, reducing his Occidental holdings by nearly a third, according to a letter to shareholders. His stake, valued at about $1.6 billion last May, was worth about $900 million after the sale, he wrote. Replacing the company’s leadership would cause its value to “meaningfully increase,” he said in an interview last week. Icahn then declined to say how much he lost on the sale of the 10 million Occidental shares.

12.56284703182819," Occidental Petroleum stepping up oil and gas asset sales: marketing document BANGALORE/HOUSTON (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp OXY.N is stepping up its oil and gas-producing property sales, adding land in Utah's Uinta Basin acquired as part of its $38 billion deal for Anadarko Petroleum, according to a marketing document seen by Reuters. Occidental aims to reduce the $40 billion of debt from the Anadarko purchase and has raised about $10 billion so far through sales of properties, including a liquefied natural gas project in Mozambique and oil production elsewhere in Africa. It has targeted $15 billion in proceeds by mid-2020. Its latest offer covers about 190,000 net acres in Uinta Basin’s Greater Natural Buttes gas field that could bring between $190 million to $240 million based on prior gas deals in the Rockies, according to a source familiar with the matter. Occidental declined to comment on the potential sale. The property has forecast net production of 215 million cubic feet equivalent per day and projected 12-month cash flow of $48 million, according to the document. EOG Resources and QEP Resources operate on property nearby. Anadarko had not completed a new well on the acreage since 2016, according to the marketing document. It reduced activity in the field to focus on more lucrative areas. CIBC Griffis & Small is the financial and technical adviser. Occidental last month began soliciting bids for oil and gas properties in Wyoming and Colorado that it hopes will fetch up to $700 million.

Occidental offered about 200,000 acres in the Denver-Julesburg Basin of Wyoming and Colorado that produce $66 million a year in cash flow, mostly in mineral royalties, according to marketing documents. RBC Capital Markets is handling the sale, with bids due next month. Occidental separately has offered its own Midland, Texas, campus, according to a real estate listing bit.ly/2O1vzIU. The facility was valued at $45.7 million last year, according to county tax records. Spokeswoman Melissa Schoeb said Occidental plans to move its Midland staff to offices Anadarko was building prior to the acquisition. She declined to comment on the sale of Wyoming and Colorado assets. The two are among a string of smaller asset sales to further reduce the debt load of about $40 billion that Occidental took on with the Anadarko purchase. It has raised about $10 billion so far through sales of properties including a liquefied natural gas project in Mozambique and production in Africa. Still, Occidental recently put on hold plans to divest its pipeline unit after failing to attract an attractive offer. It also needs the cash the unit generates, analysts said. Selling minerals, smaller assets and real estate “may help” analysts at Tudor Pickering Holt wrote in a note on Monday. “But we believe additional color from management would go a long way in helping the market ascertain how the company plans to bring down absolute leverage in a meaningful way.” Occidental risks its dividend without “meaningful and quick deleveraging,” said Jennifer Rowland, analyst with Edward Jones. Last week, it said it would cut 2020 capital spending by about 40%, reducing spending in Colorado and Texas. Shares have slid more than 40% since its interest in Anadarko became public. It closed at $38.90 on Monday, down 3%. The drilling acreage offered is mostly in Wyoming and includes minerals, properties Occidental operates and some land leased to other producers. People familiar with the offer valued the properties at between $500 million and $700 million. Occidental is the largest private landowner in Wyoming, said Pete Obermueller, president of the Petroleum Association of Wyoming. It hold 1 million acres and is mainly focused on development in the Powder River Basin."

Icahn has opposed the deal as “hugely overpriced” and a misplaced bet-the-company gamble on oil prices rising, and urged Occidental’s board to instead put the company on the market. Icahn sold 10 million shares and now holds 23 million shares, valued around $900 million, he said. He had owned a $1.6 billion stake in Occidental as of May 30.

Occidental did not respond immediately to a request for comment. Its shares traded at $39.90, up 2.2% on Friday. It plans to slash spending next year by 40% and cut back on production goals in order to meet dividend and debt payments, it disclosed Monday when it released third quarter financial results. Icahn wants to replace board members, have the company accelerate asset sales, and in court is seeking documents related to the deal. Replacing the company’s leadership would cause its value to “meaningfully increase,” Icahn said in an interview on Friday. Icahn declined to say how much he lost on the sale of the 10 million Occidental shares. The company has lost $21 billion in market cap since the deal was rumored, his shareholder letter said. He plans a proxy fight against the board. Icahn and Occidental are battling in a Delaware court over the release of documents relating to the Anadarko deal. A letter to a judge earlier this week said Icahn wants to know, “whether the actions of the directors and management were just serious mistakes or whether they represented knowing intentional breaches of fiduciary duty similar to those seen with Enron, Worldcom and other failed companies.”"

Analysts and activist investors have been pushing the company to reduce expenses and pay down debt faster. It quadrupled its debt to $40 billion with the Anadarko deal. Occidental’s spending on new projects next year will fall to $5.3 billion to $5.5 billion, down from a $9 billion budget this year.

The Houston-based company reported a third-quarter net loss of $912 million after a year-ago profit of $1.87 billion. The loss included nearly $1.3 billion in pretax acquisition costs and impairment charges. “We remain committed to the strategy we laid out to our investors, which focuses on deleveraging and returning excess free cash flow to shareholders,” Chief Executive Vicki Hollub said in a statement. The company’s shares fell less than 1% in late trading. It is expected to hold a briefing on Tuesday to discuss its results. Occidental topped its production forecast, delivering 1.16 million barrels of oil and gas. However, its crude sold for $56.26 a barrel on average, down more than $6 a barrel from a year ago.

The Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) Maran Andromeda was chartered by Occidental on Friday for an estimated Nov. 20 departure, according to one shipbroker and Refinitiv Eikon shipping data. Global shipping rates, and in particular U.S. Gulf Coast to Asia, have skyrocketed after the United States in late September imposed sanctions on two units of China’s COSCO, alleging involvement in ferrying crude out of Iran. U.S. Gulf Coast exporters have held back on chartering COSCO-linked vessels and scrambled to replace those already on charter over the past two weeks, traders and shipbrokers said. Occidental is one of the biggest exporters of U.S. crude and routinely ships to Asian buyers, trade sources said. The company did not respond to requests for comment. A fully loaded VLCC can carry between 1.9 million and 2.2 million barrels of crude oil. A different supertanker owned by Maran Tankers could also be used for Occidental’s cargo if the Andromeda cannot be chartered, two shipping sources said. Freight rates for U.S. Gulf Coast to China remained elevated at about $13 million on Monday, according to data from shipbroker McQuilling Services."
3.3466878036233827," Occidental puts plans to divest Western Midstream on ice -sources Oct 4 (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp has put plans to divest part of its ownership in pipeline operator Western Midstream Partners on hold until next year, after failing to attract an offer it deemed attractive, people familiar with the matter said on Friday. The Houston-based oil and gas exploration and production company inherited Western Midstream earlier this year as part of its $38 billion acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum Corp, a move which gave it substantial Permian Basin acreage but also assets in areas it had previously exited or had little interest in. Occidental has moved to offload some of these superfluous positions. It signed an $8.8 billion agreement with Total SA for Anadarko’s African assets in May and held talks in recent weeks with possible buyers, including private equity firms and infrastructure funds, about selling some of Western Midstream. However, a decline in pipeline stocks since the end of July impacted Western Midstream’s value. Its market value is down nearly 18% since July 30. Occidental was unwilling to sell at a price it deemed too low, according to four sources familiar with the matter. A spokeswoman for Occidental declined to comment. Western Midstream is structured as a master limited partnership, a tax-efficient vehicle used by a number of U.S. pipeline firms. Occidental fully owns the general partner stake, which effectively controls Western Midstream, and around 55% of Western Midstream’s limited partner units. The LP units were trading at $25.21 on Friday, giving Western Midstream a value of around $11.3 billion. Occidental wanted to so it could retain control of Western Midstream but reduce its holding enough so that it didn’t have to count Western Midstream’s $7.5 billion debt load on Occidental’s books, according to two of the sources. Some investors, including activist Carl Icahn, raised concerns about how much Occidental was stretching itself financially to buy Anadarko. Occidental hedged around 40% of its 2020 production to safeguard its cash flows and dividend and said it would raise billions from asset sales to pay down debt. Earlier this week, Occidental said it remains on track to deliver $10 billion to $15 billion of planned asset sales and remains confident in its deleveraging strategy. As well as Anadarko’s legacy Africa assets, Occidental has sold its stake in Plains All American Pipeline LP for $650 million and signed a partnership with Colombia’s Ecopetrol to develop some Texas acreage worth up to $1.5 billion.

Anadarko led a liquefied natural gas project in the southern African country, but it was replaced by Total TOTF.PA after the French oil major agreed to buy Anadarko's African assets as part of the Occidental takeover. President Filipe Nyusi announced the capital gains tax target after he met Occidental and Total managers in the city of Chimoio, O Pais reported. Mozambique’s economy has been hobbled in recent years by a hidden debts scandal, which prompted donors to cut off funding and deterred investment. It is banking on its massive natural gas reserves to lift millions out of poverty. In 2017, Mozambique sought $350 million in capital gains tax from Italian energy company ENI ENI.MI for its sale of a stake in the Coral South natural gas field to ExxonMobil XOM.N."

The changes would include lowering the threshold to call a special meeting from 25% to 15% of shares outstanding, and forming a board committee on sustainability and shareholder engagement as well as an integration committee that would focus on Occidental’s recent acquisition of rival Anadarko Petroleum Corp. Occidental will recommend shareholders approve the changes at its 2020 annual meeting, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Icahn owns nearly $2 billion in shares of oil and gas producer Occidental and has launched a battle to remove four Occidental directors and replace them with his own, four-person slate. Icahn and Occidental could not be immediately reached for comment late Thursday."
-14.638587925651974," Occidental CEO calls for new U.S. laws to boost carbon capture CHICAGO (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp plans to shift toward a carbon-neutral production model, it chief executive said on Thursday, but new U.S. laws are needed to support technologies designed to fight global warming. Occidental, which recently purchased oil producer Anadarko Petroleum in $38 billion deal, is advancing its use of technologies to capture carbon, and prevent the element from escaping into the atmosphere. To make this a reality on a large scale, though, legislative change is needed, Occidental CEO Vicki Hollub told nearly 200 investors, government leaders and carbon sequestration companies at an Oil and Gas Climate Initiative investments conference in Chicago. While Congress has adopted tax credits for sequestration products, new laws are needed to support development of carbon sequestration infrastructure, she said. She urged attendees to call on Congress to support legislation to facilitate the permitting and development of carbon capture sequestration projects and carbon dioxide pipelines. Such a bill could give gives carbon sequestration technology a funding boost similar to what solar, wind and other technologies have already received. Carbon sequestration technology works by trapping carbon in caverns or porous spaces underground. Occidental injects 2.6 billion cubic feet per day of CO2 in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico to aid in extraction of crude oil, according to the company’s website. The excess CO2 is recovered and reinjected until it largely becomes trapped underground. Oxy will expand its efforts to capture carbon, use it in oil extraction and other processes, and store it, offsetting emissions from oil production and use, she said. “There’s no way to cap global warming without significant sequestration and use of CO2,” she said. “That is part of our strategy. It’s got to happen in a big way.”. Expanding carbon capture, use and sequestration will ultimately make the company’s global oil output carbon neutral, and not just in shale formations, Hollub said. She said the company previously had a timeline for becoming carbon neutral, but is still adjusting the plans to reflect its Anadarko purchase. She said the industry’s move to carbon neutrality will take decades. Skeptics have questioned carbon capture and sequestration but said it is needed to bring oil production to zero emissions, Hollub added. “As much as some people want oil and gas to go away in the next couple of decades, it cannot,” she said. “What we can do is make sure all companies have access to these technologies.”"
-9.494763243557303," Icahn opposes new directors chosen by Occidental CEO HOUSTON (Reuters) - Activist investor Carl Icahn, who has launched a proxy fight to win seats on Occidental Petroleum's OXY.N board, said on Wednesday he opposed efforts by the Houston-based company to name new directors without picking from his slate. Icahn cited a Bank of America Merrill Lynch analyst’s report published on Monday that quoted CEO Vicki Hollub as saying the oil producer’s board planned to make governance changes, including the appointment of two “qualified” directors. Occidental had previously dismissed his candidates as inadequate. The activist investor owns nearly $2 billion in shares of oil and gas producer Occidental, and last month launched a battle to remove four Occidental directors and replace them with his own, four-person slate. On Wednesday, he blasted Hollub for looking for directors “anywhere but in our direction,” asking in an open letter to shareholders why his candidates had not been considered. A spokesman for Occidental did not immediately respond to a request for comment. “We’re going to keep fighting them,” said Icahn in an interview on Wednesday. “Unless we get on the board, we’re not going away until the annual meeting” next year, he said. Icahn, who continues to seek support for a consent solicitation, predicted he would get 20% of Occidental shareholders to call on the company to set a record date for a vote. ""We have proposed four highly-qualified director candidates,"" Icahn said in his letter. His slate includes two executives of his hedge fund, the former finance chief of a U.S. consumer products company, and the former president of Royal Dutch Shell's RDSa.L U.S. arm. Occidental completed a $38 billion purchase of rival Anadarko Petroleum this month, a deal that Icahn had opposed, calling it “hugely overpriced.” He criticized the firm’s existing directors for failing to give shareholders a say on the purchase. He has claimed Occidental pursued Anadarko to avoid becoming a takeover candidate. A suit against Occidental, seeking documents on its pursuit of Anadarko and deal with Berkshire Hathaway Corp will be heard in a Delaware court next month, he said. Berkshire committed $10 billion to bankroll the Occidental-Anadarko deal on terms that Icahn said were too favorable to Berkshire."

-13.047752406438715," Occidental finance chief pledges to quickly pare acquisition debt DENVER (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp OXY.N expects to quickly reduce the $40 billion in debt it took on with its purchase of Anadarko Petroleum, the company's finance chief said on Monday. Cedric Burgher, in his first public remarks since the $38 billion acquisition closed last week, told an EnerCom energy conference audience, the resulting debt burden was “not too bad,” and pledged Occidental would be selective in choosing assets to sell. He defended the purchase, which has been attacked by activist Carl Icahn as “misguided and hugely overpriced,” as providing future oil production as a good valuation. Icahn is seeking to remove and replace four directors to influence the scale and pace of asset sales. “When the smoke clears, people will start to see what we’ve done,” Burgher said to an overflow crowd. Shares of Occidental fell 4.5% on Monday to $45.01, the lowest level in roughly a decade following a downgrade from analysts at investment firm Evercore ISI. “The purchase of Anadarko makes Occidental larger but significantly less valuable,” Evercore analysts wrote in a note to investors on Monday. Burgher said the deal would achieve $3.5 billion in synergies and cost savings through divestitures and by eliminating redundancies, including duplicate offices. The company plans to keep Anadarko’s campus in Woodlands, Texas, indefinitely, and make a decision on the space in several years, Burgher said. It plans to remain in Houston and will sell a property that was acquired last year for a new Houston headquarters, he said. Occidental also plans to be selective about what properties it puts on the market to help pay off the debt, he also said, saying it likes the U.S. offshore production acquired in the deal. “We like the Gulf of Mexico (properties) we think it’s a keeper; great free cash flow, great assets,” he said. He made no mention of the Western Midstream Partners stake that it also acquired with Anadarko."

-13.411457710929787," Anadarko shareholders go for the cash in $38 billion Occidental buyout HOUSTON (Reuters) - Shareholders of Anadarko Petroleum Corp APC.N on Thursday voted overwhelmingly to sell the company for $38 billion to rival Occidental Petroleum Corp OXY.N, ending a short-lived contest that pitted two of the most storied names in the oil industry against one another. Occidental in May beat out Chevron Corp CVX.N to grab a major oil industry prize: Anadarko's nearly quarter million acres in the Permian Basin, the top U.S. shale field, where low-cost output has helped turn the United States into the world’s top oil producer at more than 12 million barrels per day. Anadarko’s shareholders voted 99% in favor of the deal that gives them $72.34 per share based on Wednesday’s closing price for Occidental. Investors also voted in a non=binding measure 71% against executive payouts tied to the deal. Anadarko’s top six executives are to receive $300 million in payouts. Occidental said immediately after the vote it had closed the transaction, and had named new executives to run Western Midstream Partners LP WES.N, Anadarko's natural gas pipeline business. Its shares rose 2.5% to close at $47.13. “We begin our work to integrate our two companies and unlock the significant value of this combination for shareholders,” Occidental Chief Executive Vicki Hollub said in a statement. Anadarko shares are up 56% from the day before it disclosed merger talks, while Occidental shares are down 30% since its discussions were revealed. The market’s sour response has dampened enthusiasm for deals. Even with stocks of many shale firms trading at multi-year lows, it may not be enough to spur a buyout spree by the world’s largest oil and gas firms, said Artem Abramov, analyst with Rystad Energy. “Some super-majors might be waiting for even lower pricing,” Abramov said. Hollub has been lining up financing and organizing asset sales to fund the deal while battling activist investor Carl Icahn, who wants to replace four Occidental directors and influence the pace of the company’s asset sales. Hollub avoided her own shareholder vote on the deal by securing a controversial and pricey $10 billion financing agreement with Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway BRKa.N. Icahn likened the deal to ""taking candy from a baby"" on Buffett's part. Occidental this week sold $13 billion in bonds to help fund the Anadarko purchase and has proposed selling Anadarko’s Africa assets to Total SA TOTF.PA. It also formed a drilling partnership with Colombia’s state-run oil company Ecopetrol SA ECO.CN to develop part of its Permian shale field for up to $1.5 billion. Occidental last week reported a 14% drop in second quarter profit, as costs related to the deal and weaker chemical earnings hit its bottom line."

The earlier-than-expected closing will give the company a head start to evaluate assets that it plans to sell to pay off debt supporting the acquisition, Occidental Chief Executive Vicki Hollub said on a conference call following release of the company’s second-quarter results. Occidental is battling activist investor Carl Icahn, who opposed the deal and launched a proxy fight to remove and replace four Occidental directors over what he called the “misguided” acquisition. That contest is expected to drag on into the fall. Anadarko shareholders are expected next week to approve a deal that provides a 57% premium to its share price the day before it disclosed acquisition talks. Hollub said the company would not make a decision on the fate of Anadarko’s stake in Western Midstream Partners until after the closing. She has pledged to raise between $10 billion and $15 billion by the end of 2021 from asset sales to help pay for the deal. “We’ve got a lot of incoming calls about various things,” the CEO said of rivals’ interest in Anadarko assets. She declined to say what properties would be offered. It has struck an agreement with Total to acquire Anadarko’s Africa assets for $10 billion. Occidental this week hedged about 40% of its combined oil production into 2020 to assure shareholders it could make its dividend payments while paying off increased debt from the deal, finance chief Cedric Burgher said. “The hedges will strengthen our cash flow from operations and provide assurance our dividend is safe,” he said."

Still, the results topped Wall Street estimates for the period and Occidental’s operating cash flow rebounded from last quarter to $2.96 billion, up 7% from the same quarter a year ago. Investors closely watch operating cash flow as a sign of a company’s ability to cover shareholder payouts and operating expenses. Core income fell to $729 million, or 97 cents per share, in the second quarter, from $848 million, or $1.10 per share, a year earlier. Analysts were expecting the company to report earnings of 93 cents a share on the same basis, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. (bit.ly/32VraOa) Among its major businesses, operating profit in oil and gas fell 7% to $726 million, chemicals fell 34% to $208 million and earnings from its pipeline unit rose 32% to $331 million, compared with year-ago figures. Profits were hurt by $107 million in one-time costs, including Anadarko-related transaction and debt financing fees. Daily average oil and gas production was 741,000 barrels per day (bpd), up from 639,000 bpd a year earlier. Higher production was offset by weaker prices, with the realized price for its oil and U.S. natural gas off 6.7% and 85%, respectively, from a year earlier. The company plans to hold a conference call with analysts on Thursday to discuss the results. Icahn this month launched a campaign to unseat four Occidental directors, arguing they entered into the deal for Anadarko to preclude Occidental from becoming a takeover target. He has attacked the deal as too pricy and for the lack of an Occidental shareholder vote. The company also said it has formed a drilling partnership with Colombia's state-run oil company Ecopetrol SA ECO.CN to develop its acreage in the Midland portion of the Permian shale field for up to $1.5 billion. Occidental said the agreement, which it expects to conclude in late 2019, would allow it to accelerate development plans. Ecopetrol said the joint venture would add some 160 million barrels of crude to its proven reserves, an about 10% increase on last year’s figure. It also will allow the Colombian company to gradually increase its net production to 95,000 bpd in 2027, it added. In its last earnings report before shareholders vote on the sale on Aug. 8, Anadarko also beat analysts’ estimates for quarterly profit as higher production offset lower prices for its oil."

It reported a net loss on a $1 billion breakup fee paid to Chevron Corp CVX.N. Anadarko accepted a $38 billion offer from Occidental after having initially agreed to a deal with Chevron. The deal would make Occidental the largest oil producer in the Permian Basin, the top U.S. shale field.

The request comes one week after the takeover deal’s biggest critic, billionaire investor Carl Icahn, laid out plans to shake up Occidental’s board. ISS issued a research note on Thursday recommending that shareholders provide consent for the request to fix a record date, which would determine which shareholders would be able to have a say on possibly electing dissident directors. The note, written by Cristiano Guerra, who heads ISS’s Special Situations Research Group, also says ISS is not backing Icahn’s nominees or planned changes. Occidental said it disagreed with ISS’s recommendation that shareholders should take the first step and request the fixing of a Record Date for the consent solicitation and only later focus on whether the Icahn Group’s proposals would harm or further shareholder interests. “The Board of Directors has unanimously determined that fixing a Record Date for the Icahn Group’s planned consent solicitation and the proposals the Icahn Group intends to ask shareholders to act on are NOT in the best interests of Occidental or our shareholders,” the company said in a statement. Shareholders were prevented from commenting on the company’s “transformational and controversial transaction” with Anadarko, the ISS note said, and should be given a voice on such issues before next year’s annual general meeting. “There seems to be sufficient reason to address these concerns now, rather than waiting until the 2020 AGM.” A week ago Icahn, a who owns 4.4% of Occidental and has become the most vocal critic of the $38 billion takeover of Anadarko, filed a solicitation statement with U.S. regulators. He wants to replace four board members with two of his employees and two executives who have financial and oil industry expertise. Icahn has criticized Occidental Chief Executive Vicki Hollub for the company’s financial record and for seeking outside financing for the deal from billionaire investor Warren Buffett that did not require shareholder approval. In order to provide consent, Occidental’s investors, including mutual fund firm T. Rowe Price among others, must provide a Record Date Request Form and answer a questionnaire that includes their trading history in Occidental stock. They also must instruct their Depository Trust Company to take actions on their behalf. Because shareholders cannot vote on this transaction, “along with the self-evident complexity of the consent solicitation process, suggests that a more open and thorough debate regarding Occidental’s strategic direction and overall governance would be beneficial,” the ISS note said."

Icahn Enterprises responded by circulating a draft letter to Occidental holders that hit the lack of a vote on the proposed acquisition, which it called a “massive and risky Anadarko bet that gambles the Company’s future ....” The hedge fund further described the two directors’ pay as excessive and called the Anadarko purchase a “de facto poison pill to ensure Oxy remains a stand-alone company, thus ensuring Hollub and Batchelder keep their jobs, power, and lucrative compensation.” Icahn’s nominees are John Hofmeister, former president of Shell Oil Co; Alan LeFevre, former finance chief of consumer goods firm Jarden Corp; and Nicholas Graziano and Andrew Langham, executives with Icahn’s investment company. Occidental also called on shareholders to reject the consent solicitation put forward by Icahn to get a vote on his nominees.

Icahn has blasted the Houston-based oil and gas producer for failing to give owners a say on its proposed $38 billion acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum APC.N, which he has called ""misguided and hugely overpriced"". “Occidental refused to craft a compromise and so we’ll happily take our case to stockholders which the company should have done with this bet-the-company transaction,” Icahn told Reuters on Thursday. “We prefer to have peace and have a great record in reaching settlements,” Icahn added. Icahn’s use of a consent solicitation to elect directors would require a majority of shares outstanding to be voted in favor, a greater hurdle than a special meeting of shareholders, according to an Occidental spokesman. Occidental has urged shareholders to reject the activist’s proxy, calling the request “not in the best interests of Occidental or its shareholders”. If Icahn’s solicitation is successful, the record date for a vote on the Icahn candidates could be scheduled as soon as September or October. In the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Icahn identified his four candidates for the board: John Hofmeister, the former president of Shell Oil Company; Alan LeFevre, the former finance chief of consumer goods firm Jarden Corp; and Nicholas Graziano and Andrew Langham, two executives with Icahn’s own investment company. Icahn spoke with Occidental CEO Vicki Hollub on July 10 in an 11th-hour effort to reach a compromise and avert a proxy fight. His associates also spoke with Occidental executives twice earlier this month, according to the filing. The investor expects to schedule meetings with Occidental shareholders in the next four weeks to press the case for board seats. The proxy fight is unlikely to stop the Anadarko deal, but would influence the pace and direction of billions of dollars of asset sales that will result after the acquisition closes. Occidental has proposed selling Anadarko’s Africa assets, including a proposed Mozambique liquefied natural gas project estimated to cost $20 billion. Anadarko also owns significant offshore wells and production platforms in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. Freeport-McMoRan FCX.N, which in 2016 sold some of those same offshore assets to Anadarko, did so while under pressure from Icahn's investment fund, which held seats on the mining firm's board.

-19.08890493175795," Anadarko shareholders to vote next month on Occidental deal HOUSTON (Reuters) - Anadarko Petroleum Corp shareholders will vote Aug. 8 on the oil and gas producer’s planned $38 billion sale to Occidental Petroleum Corp - the biggest oil and gas deal of the year. Occidental avoided its own shareholder vote on the deal by securing a controversial $10 billion financing agreement with Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway, which allowed it to raise the cash portion of its offer. While an Anadarko holders’ vote for the proposed deal is very likely, the price has angered several Occidental investors, including billionaire activist Carl Icahn, who has called for a special meeting to replace four Occidental directors. Icahn’s demand for Occidental seats seeks to influence the pace and scale of its future asset sales. He has attacked the Anadarko deal as “hugely overpriced” and criticized Occidental Chief Executive Vicki Hollub’s agreements with Berkshire Hathaway and Total SA that are designed to help finance the purchase. Anadarko holders would receive about $73.46 for each of their shares, a 57% premium over the stock’s closing stock price on April 11, the day before Anadarko said it had a merger agreement with Chevron Corp; Chevron was later outmaneuvered by Occidental. Anadarko closed at $71.98 on Thursday. With Anadarko’s nearly quarter million acres in the Permian Basin, the top U.S. shale field, Occidental would command 1.64 million acres of prime drilling and gain access to fields in Colorado and Wyoming. Hollub has promised to quickly shed most of Anadarko’s non-U.S. oil properties to focus on shale. She also must absorb or sell Anadarko’s U.S. Gulf of Mexico offshore properties, where it is the third-largest oil producer by volume."

-10.41529554134787," U.S. oil deals rebound from first-quarter low, but still muted (Reuters) - The value of deals in the U.S. oil and gas sector rebounded in the second quarter from historic lows in the first, but the bounce-back was muted excluding Occidental Petroleum Corp’s $57 billion Anadarko Petroleum Corp buy, according to data released on Tuesday. The rebound comes at a time when investors have been pushing shale producers, who have driven a recent merger boom, to focus on lifting shareholder returns rather than production. The Occidental-Anadarko deal accounted for 88% of the roughly $65 billion worth of deals by U.S. exploration and production companies in the second quarter, energy consultancy Drillinginfo said. Excluding the mega-merger, second-quarter mergers and acquisitions of $7.6 billion was less than half of the average quarterly total of $19 billion in the 2017-18 period, Drillinginfo's report bit.ly/2KQiO4R showed. “Wall Street, consistent with the message for E&Ps to live within cash flow, has cut off new investment dollars from public markets,” Drillinginfo M&A analyst Andrew Dittmar said. The report also flagged a lack of widely-anticipated consolidation among public companies after the Occidental-Anadarko deal, primarily attributable to a wide gap in price expectations between buyers and sellers. With no new investment from Wall Street, smaller producers have also been particularly impacted. “Some of these smaller companies could evaluate whether they would be better off private,” Dittmar added. However, mergers where both companies own 50% each of the combined entity were more likely to take place in the future, the report said."
-7.661687090132649," Icahn steps up fight with Occidental over deal, wants board seats (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Carl Icahn on Wednesday ratcheted up his fight with Occidental Petroleum over its pending purchase of rival Anadarko Petroleum by calling for a special shareholder meeting where he hopes to win board seats. In a regulatory filing, Icahn said he planned to oust and replace four Occidental directors and change the company’s charter through a stockholder consent solicitation to prevent it from ever engineering a similar takeover again. Responding to the filing, Occidental said it will review the latest materials filed by Icahn, and looks forward to addressing them in ongoing conversations with shareholders. Icahn, one of industry’s most powerful activist investors, cast himself as one of the deal’s most fervent critics by charging that Occidental’s $38 billion bid for Anadarko was too expensive and could endanger Occidental’s future if oil prices sink. The deal has been approved by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and is expected to close in the second half of the year. Icahn’s move on Wednesday put fresh pressure on Occidental’s management and Chief Executive Vicki Hollub at a critical time and has sparked speculation that Occidental may try to settle with him. “It is important to add new directors to Occidental’s Board of Directors to oversee future extraordinary transactions like the Anadarko transaction and to ensure that they are not consummated without stockholder approval when appropriate,” Icahn said in a statement to shareholders on Wednesday. Icahn owned a $1.6 billion stake in Occidental as of May 30. While the move was notable, it hardly came as a surprise as Icahn had been hinting for weeks that he might push for a special meeting where other shareholders would be able to express their frustration with management. In May he sued Occidental in Delaware court, and earlier this week he went out of his way to criticize the Occidental-Anadarko deal while discussing the merger of major casino operators Caesars Entertainment Corp and Eldorado Resorts Inc. “The recent Occidental Petroleum fiasco is a great example of how CEOs and boards will go to great lengths, including ‘betting the company’ to serve their own agendas,” Icahn said in a statement about the Caesars-Eldorado merger. “If their bet is successful, they and possibly their shareholders win, but if it is unsuccessful, only the shareholders lose.” While Icahn has said publicly that the Occidental-Anadarko deal likely would not be derailed, his filing illustrates how he wants to make sure that nothing similar happens again. He said Occidental lacks effective corporate governance and that its directors made mistakes in how and at what cost they pursued the acquisition of Anadarko, according to the filing. Icahn is calling on the board to set a record date to determine which shareholders could petition to hold a special meeting. The oil and gas producer’s bid for Anadarko topped one by Chevron Corp and includes a $10 billion financing deal with Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. The merger of the two U.S. shale producers would increase Occidental’s debt to around $40 billion. Icahn, in his lawsuit filed in Delaware Court of Chancery in May, sought access to the oil producer’s financial records and details of negotiations."

-4.336740843417772," Anadarko pressed Occidental for cash, expecting investor opposition -filing HOUSTON (Reuters) - Anadarko Petroleum exacted a top price for itself by repeatedly spurning Occidental Petroleum’s approaches and pushing for all-cash offers, reasoning the market might react negatively to the blockbuster $38 billion deal, according to securities filings released on Friday. Occidental last month beat out Chevron Corp to grab a major oil industry prize: nearly a quarter million acres in the Permian Basin, the top U.S. shale field, where low-cost output has helped turn the United States into the world’s top oil producer at more than 12 million barrels per day. Anadarko’s tactics sweetened the sales terms and guaranteed a huge payday for its executives, Chevron and deal advisers, the filing showed. Anadarko Chief Executive Al Walker will receive $98 million and President Robert Gwin $55 million, their share of $300 million in payouts to Anadarko’s top six executives. Investment bankers Evercore Group and Goldman Sachs & Co, which represented Anadarko, each earned a $53 million fee, the filing showed. Chevron received a $1 billion breakup fee. Anadarko’s board used the suitors’ competing offers to press for better terms, according to detailed accounts presented for the first time in the filing. The board pushed Occidental to revise an initial, all-stock offer that was not tax-free, needed a shareholder vote and required a change to its charter. Those efforts prodded Occidental to obtain financing from billionaire Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc that eliminated a shareholder vote. In addition, the Anadarko board urged Chevron to increase its initial offer, winning a $1 a share increase to $65 a share, and got Chevron to agree to eliminate a provision requiring its own offer to be presented to Anadarko shareholders if another deal appeared. Occidental CEO Vicki Hollub began pursuing Anadarko in July 2017, and that fall presented a stock-swap that valued its rival at $61.22 a share. Walker rejected the offer and she followed up with a deal valuing Anadarko at $76 a share, the filing showed. The two continued talks through 2018 with the frequency growing after Chevron CEO Michael Wirth approached Anadarko in February offering to buy it for $64 a share in a deal that was 25 percent cash and 75 percent stock. Anadarko’s board initially favored Chevron after concluding Occidental’s shares would fall once its offer was publicly announced, and the drop would lower the value of the deal to Anadarko’s shareholders. It pressed Hollub to put a collar on the stock portion. The board also calculated that Occidental would have to sell assets to pay down debt, adding to the risks it would face. Anadarko’s board believed that if it accepted Occidental’s bid first, Chevron would walk away, but if it accepted the Chevron deal, “there was a substantial likelihood that Occidental would continue its pursuit” and “Anadarko’s stockholders would benefit significantly.” Occidental, Anadarko and Chevron did not respond to requests for further comment. Occidental’s shares have fallen nearly 28% since its offer for Anadarko became public. It traded on Friday down 0.9% at $47.84, a more than decade low, while Anadarko shares were down a fraction at $70.05. Chevron’s stock traded at $121.48 on Friday, about even with where it traded when it walked away from the deal. Occidental has said it plans to shed most of Anadarko’s non-shale properties and has lined up France’s Total SA to acquire African oil-producing properties for $8.8 billion. The deal has angered several Occidental investors and prompted activist Carl Icahn to seek seats on its board, calling the transaction “hugely overpriced.” He also demanded financial records and called on Hollub speed up asset sales. He and other investors have criticized the financing agreement with Berkshire Hathaway for an 8% dividend on its $10 billion investment. The deal has to be approved by Anadarko shareholders, who would receive $59 in cash and a 0.29 share in Occidental for each Anadarko share.

His lawsuit calls Occidental’s $38 billion purchase of Anadarko “fundamentally misguided and hugely overpriced” and asks for access to Occidental’s financial records and details of negotiations. Icahn, who owns $1.6 billion worth of Occidental shares, accused the board of being “far over their heads,” saying they “made numerous blunders in recent months and might continue to trip over their feet if the board is not strengthened,” the lawsuit said. He also criticized Occidental Chief Executive Vicki Hollub and her management team for taking $100 million in pay since 2016. Occidental said it would respond to the lawsuit and expects to complete the merger this year. Its bid for Anadarko topped one by Chevron Corp and includes a $10 billion financing deal with Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. “Occidental is committed to maximizing long-term value for all shareholders, and our board and management team continually evaluate opportunities to that end,” the company said. Icahn’s lawsuit, filed in Delaware Court of Chancery, seeks documents that detail Occidental’s sale of preferred stock to Berkshire, which he described as a “desperate” move, and information on a deal to sell Anadarko’s Africa assets to Total SA for $8.8 billion. The merger of the two U.S. shale producers would increase Occidental’s debt to around $40 billion, assuming it sells the Africa assets to Total. Icahn may seek to call a special meeting of shareholders to remove and replace directors, the suit said, and believes Occidental should have been a seller rather than a buyer. “That would have been the stockholder-friendly thing to do,” the suit said. It also ask for details on whether other companies have inquired about buying all or part of Occidental. The Berkshire investment allowed Occidental to increase the cash portion of its bid for Anadarko and eliminated the need for Occidental to win approval from its own shareholders. The acquisition is “little more than an enormous bet on the price of oil,” the lawsuit said, adding that “if management’s dreams of glory require placing the stockholders’ dividends at risk, the stockholders really ought to be asked whether they agree.” Icahn was not the only investor to take issue with the lack of a shareholder vote on the deal. T. Rowe Price Group Inc said it would vote against the Occidental board of directors at the company’s annual meeting earlier this month because the company would not allow shareholders to vote on its bid for Anadarko, which T. Rowe Price and other shareholders opposed. Occidental shares closed down a fraction at $51.91 on Thursday, near a 10-year low. The shares are off from $65.33 on April 12 when the company’s interest in Anadarko was first disclosed."

-16.207412002786775," Occidental to sell parts of Anadarko after debt-fueled acquisition HOUSTON (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum snatched up some of the richest shale oilfields in Texas when it beat out rival Chevron Corp in a bidding war to acquire Anadarko Petroleum. It also quadrupled its debt - to $40 billion - at a time when investors are calling for spending cuts and higher dividends. That means the acquisition’s success will depend on how quickly Occidental can sell off some of Anadarko’s assets and focus on optimizing and integrating the assets it keeps - especially prime U.S. shale fields. Shedding debt will require selling assets when deals have been sluggish, said bankers and merger specialists. The number of U.S. deals has fallen to lows not seen in five years or more as investor demands for capital discipline have driven buyers from the market, said Todd Dittmann, managing director at investment firm Angelo Gordon. “An acquisition is more often viewed as a confession of poor drilling locations and a failure of prior strategy,” Dittmann said. Deal-makers say Chief Executive Vicki Hollub’s most likely sale prospects are Anadarko’s offshore assets in the Gulf of Mexico and its pipeline business. Her challenge will be to balance such sales with the need for their cash flow to pay debt and dividends. Hollub already has one big sale lined up: France’s Total SA agreed to pay $8.8 billion for Anadarko’s oil-and-gas producing assets outside the United States, including its biggest future expense, a multibillion-dollar liquefied natural gas project in Mozambique. Occidental declined to comment, but CEO Hollub told shareholders and analysts she expects to squeeze $3.5 billion per year in cost savings and capital spending cuts from the deal, and is eager to apply the company’s Permian Basin expertise to Anadarko’s Texas and Colorado oil fields. “We will make this work,” Hollub vowed. “We will get these synergies.” ‘AMAZING’ CASH FLOW Several major oil companies would be willing to buy the Gulf of Mexico offshore assets, or any Permian acreage if Occidental decided to sell some of its long-held properties. It controls about 2.7 million acres there already, split between shale and conventional production, and with the Anadarko deal will acquire an additional 240,000 acres in one of the more productive areas of the Permian Basin. The Gulf of Mexico business provided nearly a quarter of Anadarko’s oil and gas output while consuming just 19 percent of production spending. Hollub has praised it for its “amazing free cash flow,” and M&A analysts say could be worth at least $6 billion. Potential buyers would be the handful of large companies with deepwater experience, including Royal Dutch Shell, Exxon Mobil, Total and Chevron. Another reason to sell it: Occidental has never operated in the Gulf before. That raises concerns among investors, said Jennifer Rowland, an analyst with Edward Jones. “It just adds to the risk of a deal. They don’t have that knowledge in house,” she said. IN THE ‘DOGHOUSE’ WITH INVESTORS Another likely candidate for a sale is Western Midstream Partners, Anadarko’s majority-owned gas gathering and pipeline business, valued at around $7.5 billion. Occidental has previously sold off pipelines and coastal terminals. The company’s view of pipeline assets, said finance chief Cedric Burgher to analysts, is “you don’t need to own” them, only to have the right to use them. If Hollub can sell the offshore business and close the deal with Total, she could hit a $10 billion to $15 billion divestment target, said Matt Sallee, portfolio manager at investment firm Tortoise Capital Advisors. That could make it less likely that the company would sell any of its onshore or pipeline operations, he said. “They would probably really like to get another sale done before the deal closes to remove this risk” of too much debt, said Charles Johnston, analyst at debt research firm CreditSights. “The longer they take” to reduce debt from the deal, “the longer they stay in the doghouse with investors,” said Rowland. Occidental’s stock fell to a 10-year-low after it reached a merger agreement with Anadarko and analysts at Wells Fargo, KeyBanc Capital Markets and Edward Jones lowered ratings on the company. Rating firms are forecasting a debt downgrade because of the deal, though none expect Occidental will fall into junk bond status. Moody’s Investors Service said a “weakly positioned investment grade rating” is the most likely for Occidental. The spread on its 2027 bonds widened a modest 50 basis points since the deal was struck. “The company does have a good track record of being able to sell noncore assets at good prices,” said Carol Levenson, director at corporate bond research firm Gimme Credit. In addition to paying off the deal’s debt, Hollub needs cash to cover dividends due shareholders and Berkshire Hathaway Inc, which negotiated an 8 percent annual payout on a $10 billion investment to help fund the Anadarko deal. What Hollub doesn’t want to sell is the merger’s top prize, Anadarko’s acreage in the top U.S. shale field, the Permian Basin. Anadarko’s properties there are valued at about $18 billion, according to the research firm Drillinginfo. Anadarko’s Colorado shale operations will likely remain with the Occidental for a lack of ready buyers. New environmental regulations that give communities more control over oil and gas operations have chilled industry investments in the state. Occidental also would want to hang onto Anadarko’s Colorado shale acreage, said Andrew Dittmar, an M&A analyst with Drillinginfo, because the company is “really good at drilling shale wells.”"
-12.876610880012759," 'We are the rightful owners' of Anadarko, Occidental CEO tells shareholders HOUSTON (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Chief Executive Vicki Hollub on Friday touted her $38 billion deal for Anadarko Petroleum Corp and defended the pricey terms she negotiated in a 90-minute session with billionaire investor Warren Buffett to secure the deal without seeking shareholder approval. Hollub, 59, beat out larger rival Chevron Corp with a long-shot bid that some Occidental investors called risky because it saddles Occidental with $46 billion in new debt. By deftly lining up allies and cash, she put together a strategy that on Thursday prompted Chevron to withdraw. “We can operate this better than anybody else. We are the rightful owners,” Hollub said at the company’s annual general meeting. Shareholders including T. Rowe Price, Occidental’s sixth-largest, showed displeasure by announcing they planned to vote against the board. Directors were elected with between 70 percent and 82 percent of votes cast, below the average 97 percent that directors received a year ago. There were no questions asked at the meeting, which took place with fewer than 100 people in attendance and lasted less than an hour. Occidental’s shares on Friday closed at a 10-year low of $54.97, down from $62.35 the day before Occidental disclosed its offer for Anadarko. Several big holders have criticized Hollub’s decision to boost the cash portion of the $76-per-share offer to a point where a shareholder vote is no longer needed. Hollub said it took just an hour and a half to reach an agreement with Berkshire Hathaway Inc’s Buffett on the $10 billion investment. “The timing was critical for us to close these funds,” she said. Addressing investor criticism that the Berkshire investment’s 8 percent dividend was too high, she said Occidental took the premium into account when calculating returns on the Anadarko purchase. Unless another suitor appears, the $38 billion, mostly cash deal would cement Occidental’s status as the largest oil producer in the Permian Basin, the top U.S. shale field. Occidental’s global production would double to 1.4 million barrels of oil and gas per day. Hollub has promised to quickly shed most of Anadarko’s non-U.S. oil properties to focus on shale. Occidental also must absorb or sell Anadarko’s U.S. Gulf of Mexico offshore production. With Anadarko’s nearly quarter million acres in the Permian Basin, Occidental would command 1.64 million acres of prime land in the Permian and gain access to growing shale fields in Colorado and Wyoming. The deal’s financial and operating risks have soured some big Occidental holders including T. Rowe Price and Matrix Asset Management. “On paper, at $65-per-barrel oil, the deal could be executed well. That sort of is turning a blind eye to the fact that they’re in a cyclical industry,” said David Katz, president of Matrix. Rating firm Moody’s Investors Service said Wednesday it likely would downgrade Occidental if it prevails due to the added debt that will make it harder for the company to confront a downturn in oil prices. “If you do this you have a strained balance sheet, period,” said Christian Ledoux, investment chief at Occidental shareholder South Texas Money Management. Hollub, who has sought to buy Anadarko for two years, proved her ability to sweep away hurdles when Anadarko’s board initially agreed to sell to Chevron at a lower price. “We were not about to let that happen,” Hollub said. She convinced Berkshire Hathaway Inc’s Warren Buffett to invest $10 billion in Occidental stock to help close the deal. France’s Total SA separately agreed to buy all of Anadarko’s oil-and-gas producing assets outside the United States, including its biggest future expense, a multibillion-dollar liquefied natural gas project in Mozambique, for $8.8 billion."

Hollub, 59, challenged larger rival Chevron Corp with a long-shot bid that some of her own investors say is risky because it saddles Occidental with about $46 billion in new debt. By deftly lining up allies and cash, she put together a strategy that on Thursday prompted Chevron to withdraw. The annual meeting will be the first chance for Occidental shareholders to present their views to managers, even if they do not get a say on the deal. The lack of a deal vote and the stock’s drop to $56.33 a 10-year low on Thursday could lead to a messy victory party. Several big holders have criticized Hollub’s decision to secure Anadarko by increasing the cash portion of the $76-per-share offer to a point where a shareholder vote is no longer needed.

-12.876610880012759," From Paris to Omaha: How Occidental CEO out-maneuvered Chevron in Anadarko bid NEW YORK (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum chief executive Vicki Hollub was caught off guard when U.S. oil giant Chevron swooped in last month with a $33 billion offer to buy Anadarko Petroleum, the oil and gas exploration and production firm she had been wooing for nearly two years. Chevron, nearly five times larger than Occidental, appeared to have out-maneuvered its smaller rival. But on Sunday Hollub showed the fight was not over. After a whirlwind few days to raise more cash, Hollub offered a sweetened deal. By Thursday, Chevron had bowed out. In edging out Chevron, Hollub leaned on global relationships and knowledge forged from 35 years in the oil industry, according to about a dozen people familiar with the talks leading up to the company’s latest offer. Occidental had struggled to win over Anadarko because its first public $38 billion offer of 50 percent cash and 50 percent stock, as well as previous offers made privately, required the approval of Occidental shareholders, and Anadarko was not convinced they would go for the deal, two sources familiar with the discussions told Reuters. Hollub knew she needed to substantially increase the cash offer - thereby making shareholder approval unnecessary - and moved swiftly to secure it, the sources said. She was in Paris on April 26, just two weeks after Chevron’s announcement, and struck an $8.8 billion deal with French major Total SA to sell Anadarko assets her company didn’t yet own. Two days later she was in Omaha, Nebraska, securing $10 billion in financing from billionaire investor Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc, who typically does not partner with companies pursuing unsolicited takeovers. Occidental declined to make Hollub available for an interview for this story. The company’s shares are down 9 percent since making their offer public in late April. The combined company would establish Occidental as the largest operator in the Permian basin in west Texas and New Mexico, the heart of the U.S. shale revolution, where a boom in production has propelled the United States into becoming the world’s largest oil producer. It would make Occidental the third-largest U.S. oil company with a market value of about $80 billion, dwarfed only by global giants Exxon Mobil and Chevron. “She’s doing the boldest M&A thing that’s happened since the ‘80s,” said Amy Myers Jaffe, energy consultant and senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. “You’re having an atypical M&A battle in a very competitive space where (usually) the bigger you are, the more you’re going to win.” Hollub’s challenge has stunned an industry where the last attempt to break up an agreed-upon deal between two U.S. oil companies was in 1984 when Texaco challenged Pennzoil’s acquisition of Getty Oil. It has also angered some Occidental investors who say Hollub is overstretching the company’s balance sheet in an ill-advised quest for size in a volatile industry. “Our concern is the willingness of the management team at Occidental to cut very favorable deals against the interests of shareholders on a longer-term basis,” said John Linehan, portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price. T. Rowe, the sixth-largest holder of Occidental shares, announced it would vote against the board of directors on the annual shareholder meeting Friday. But such a move may be mostly symbolic. An Occidental spokesman declined to comment on the concerns but pointed to Hollub’s defense of her strategy that it was better to raise cash than issue new debt. Hollub’s background in the technical aspects of oil production contrasts with her predecessor, a banker and known dealmaker. She has been described as down to earth by former and current employees, differing from flamboyant energy CEOs. Buying Anadarko was seen as the best way for Occidental to gain more acreage in the Permian shale basin, where it markets nearly a quarter of all barrels produced in the region. When Chevron announced a deal on April 12 to buy Anadarko, Hollub gathered the merger team. They were shocked that Anadarko had accepted a bid that was $11 per share below what Occidental had privately offered, three of the people familiar with the discussions said. “She thought, we’re in it to win it. Let’s make our offer public so their shareholders know what they passed up,” one of the sources said. In a letter to Anadarko’s board of directors on April 24, Occidental said they “were surprised and disappointed” that Anadarko had not agreed to their previous two offers in April. Anadarko executives, however, remained concerned that Occidental shareholders could scuttle the deal, leaving them without a buyer, two sources familiar with the situation said. The board of directors wanted to stick with Chevron. Just two days after sending the letter, Hollub was in Paris meeting with Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne to discuss Anadarko’s African assets, according to two sources familiar with the discussions. The two already had a relationship stemming from the Dolphin Gas Project, a Middle East cross-border gas initiative where both companies have an equal share. Total had made it known to her that they coveted Anadarko’s properties, including a liquefied natural gas project in Mozambique. “Vicki wanted to show that she could quickly put the cash on the table. In less than 10 days she had the cash ready,” a Paris-based source said. Omaha, Nebraska was next. Buffett is known for moving quickly when a deal piques his interest, but he tends to avoid getting involved in hostile takeover bids. The meeting was set up by BofA CEO Brian Moynihan, whose bank was helping to provide financing for the Anadarko deal. Hollub later said Buffett was “warm and wonderful” in their meeting, a source familiar with the discussions said. Buffett, cash flush and on the hunt for new deals, agreed to provide $10 billion in financing in return for an 8 percent premium, a concern for dividend-focused shareholders who believe the terms are too pricey. The two deals enabled Hollub to submit a revised offer on Sunday, increasing the cash component from 50 percent to 78 percent. On Thursday, Chevron said it would collect its $1 billion termination fee and walk away from the negotiations.

-17.731828950988398," Occidental tweaks $38 billion Anadarko bid to remove shareholder vote (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp increased the cash component of its $38 billion bid to acquire Anadarko Petroleum Corp on Sunday, removing a requirement for any deal to receive the approval of Occidental’s shareholders. The move means Occidental shareholders who oppose the bid, including T Rowe Price, will not get an opportunity to vote it down. It adds more certainty to the offer for Anadarko, but also risks the ire of billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who sources have said has been amassing a stake in Occidental to challenge its Anadarko offer. Occidental is trying to convince Anadarko to accept its offer and abandon the agreed $33 billion sale to Chevron Corp. Anadarko confirmed that it received the revised bid from Occidental and said its board will review the proposal. The merger agreement with Chevron remains in effect, Anadarko said and reaffirmed its existing recommendation of the deal with Chevron at this time. Earlier on Sunday, France’s Total SA said it has agreed with Occidental to buy the African assets of Anadarko for $8.8 billion, should the two U.S. oil and gas companies clinch a deal to combine. This removes the risk of Occidental not being able to shed Anadarko assets it considers non-core to the deal. On Tuesday, Occidental also secured a $10 billion investment from Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc in support of its bid for Anadarko. The terms of that deal were seen as particularly favorable to Buffett by analysts and investors. Occidental submitted a new $76 per share offer to Anadarko on Sunday structured as 78 percent cash and 22 percent stock, as opposed to an even cash/stock split in its $76 per share offer previously. This brought the number of Occidental shares required to fund the bid below the issuance threshold that would have triggered a vote on the deal by Occidental shareholders. Anadarko shareholders would still get to vote on the deal. The bidding war for Anadarko underscores the value of its assets in the lucrative Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico. The vast shale field holds oil and gas deposits that can produce supplies for decades using low-cost drilling techniques. “The financial support of Berkshire Hathaway as well as the agreement we announced with Total allows us to delever our balance sheet while focusing our integration efforts on the assets that will provide the most value for us,” Occidental Chief Executive Vicki Hollub said in a statement announcing the amended terms. However, a request made on Thursday evening by Anadarko’s counsel for three board seats in the merged entity had not been granted, Occidental added. Should Occidental’s bid be declared superior by Anadarko, Chevron will be given four days to match Occidental’s offer, according to the terms of the contract between Chevron and Anadarko. Should Anadarko abandon Chevron for Occidental, it will have to pay Chevron a $1 billion deal breakup fee. The proposed sale of Anadarko’s African assets to Total includes a 26.5 percent interest in a Mozambique liquefied natural gas project, which is moving closer to a final investment decision, and stakes in two offshore fields in Ghana. Occidental said this does not impact the planned $2 billion of annual cost savings and $1.5 billion of annual capital reductions already outlined as part of its potential acquisition of Anadarko. Total’s previously outlined plan to increase its dividend by 10 percent and buy back 5 million shares by the end of 2020 will not be impacted by the deal, the French company said in a separate statement. Chevron declined to comment on the Occidental move or say whether it will change its $65-a-share bid. Separately, Occidental said its first-quarter adjusted profit fell 10.9 percent as lower prices for its crude hurt oil and gas revenue. Adjusted profit fell to $631 million, or 84 cents per share, in the quarter ended March 31, from $708 million, or 92 cents per share, a year earlier. Production rose 18 percent to 719,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the quarter, Occidental said. Its Permian Resources unit saw output rising 47 percent year-over-year to 261,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day."
-14.550376216772573," Total enters $8.8 bln deal with Occidental for Anadarko's Africa assets PARIS, May 5 (Reuters) - French energy major Total said on Sunday it had reached a binding agreement with Occidental to acquire Anadarko assets in Algeria, Ghana, Mozambique and South Africa for a consideration of $8.8 billion. The firm said the transaction was contingent upon Occidental entering into and completing its proposed acquisition of Anadarko and approval of relevant authorities. The deal is expected to close in 2020. Total said the assets represented around 1.2 billion barrels of oil equivalent (boe) of 2P reserves, of which 70 percent is gas, plus 2 billion boe of long term natural gas resources in Mozambique. It added that despite the capital investment in Mozambique LNG, the acquisition is expected to be free cashflow positive from 2020 even at a Brent price of less than $50 per barrel and to generate more than $1 billion a year of free cashflow from 2025 onwards after start-up of Mozambique LNG. The firm confirmed its previously announced shareholder return policy from 2018 to 2020. (Reporting by Bate Felix, editing by Sybille de La Hamaide)"
-9.316139904951367," Occidental shareholders criticize bid for Anadarko, Buffett financing HOUSTON (Reuters) - Several major Occidental Petroleum Corp shareholders have voiced opposition to the oil company’s $38 billion bid for rival Anadarko Petroleum Corp that now includes a pricey financing deal with billionaire Warren Buffett. Occidental and Chevron Corp are battling for Anadarko and its holdings of nearly a quarter million acres in the Permian Basin, the top U.S. shale field, where low-cost production has helped turn the United States into the world’s top oil producer at 12.3 million barrels per day. Occidental shares were trading on Thursday at $57.48, down sharply from $66.63 a month ago, prior to rumors it might challenge Chevron. It trumped Chevron’s bid last week, and its offer now includes $10 billion in financing from Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc in exchange for preferred shares that would pay an 8 percent dividend. Major Occidental shareholders told Reuters they opposed the plan. They called the $76-per-share bid for Anadarko expensive and cited concerns about the cyclical nature of the oil business as well as the cost of getting financing from Buffett. Several Occidental shareholders said they viewed Chevron’s lower $65-per-share bid as a better fit because it could more easily swallow a company of Anadarko’s size. T. Rowe Price Group Inc, which holds shares in all three oil companies, cited merger risks and the cost of the Berkshire infusion. John Linehan, portfolio manager at T. Rowe Price, said Buffett’s deal could allow Occidental to restructure its cash-and-stock deal to avoid a shareholder vote, although its current offer includes a vote. T. Rowe Price, Occidental’s sixth largest shareholder, had 21.1 million shares at the end of 2018, according to Refinitiv Eikon figures, along with 8 million Chevron shares and 865,000 Anadarko shares. Berkshire would receive a warrant to purchase up to 80 million shares of common stock at $62.50 apiece in a private offering, in addition to the preferred stock that will accrue dividends at 8 percent per annum. “That’s very expensive paper,” Linehan said of the agreement with Berkshire. “They could have borrowed far cheaper than that.” Occidental did not respond to a request for comment on shareholder objections to the current proposal. Before the Buffett financing plan, it said the deal would result in $3.5 billion in cash flow improvements and that it would sell $10 billion to $15 billion in assets to reduce debt. Moody’s Investors Service estimated that the assumption of Anadarko’s debt and additional borrowings to cover the offer would add almost $40 billion in debt to Occidental. Moody’s put the company’s debt rating under review for downgrade. South Texas Money Management, which has $2.3 billion in assets under management, including shares of Chevron and Occidental, hopes Chevron prevails. At the end of March they owned around 580,000 shares of Occidental and 370,000 shares of Chevron worth $38.5 million and $45.5 million, respectively. “Right now their bid would allow them to extract a lot of value for that deal,” said Christian Ledoux, South Texas’ chief investment officer. Chevron’s offer was constructed as 25 percent in cash and 75 percent in stock, compared with the 50-50 split from Occidental. Even if Chevron raised its bid and offered “a little more cash,” Ledoux would still consider the deal a good one for Chevron because the company has expertise in Anadarko’s shale, liquefied natural gas and offshore assets. Chevron has not raised its bid for Anadarko, saying its agreement would provide “the best value and the most certainty to Anadarko’s shareholders.” Occidental and Chevron, two of the largest oil and gas producers in the Permian by production volumes, each believe they can best squeeze more oil from Anadarko’s 240,000 acres (97,120 hectares) in the top shale field. Occidental’s annual meeting is May 10, “and we will be interested to see the interaction between shareholders and the Board,” Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group analysts wrote in a note on Tuesday. “On paper the (Occidental) deal looks great if oil is at $65, but we’re in a cyclical industry where commodity prices change dramatically,” said David Katz, president of Matrix Asset Advisors, which held 241,700 shares of Occidental and 61,300 shares of Chevron at the end of April. “They’re basically putting the company at risk.”"

-21.974370152457485," Exclusive: Occidental emerges as heavy hitter in U.S. oil export boom NEW YORK/HOUSTON (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp has emerged as one of the biggest exporters of U.S. shale oil, rivaling large trading firms and oil majors, in a market now worth more than $150 million every day. It is showing no signs of slowing down, with plans to double crude exports by 2020. In 2017, Occidental was the largest exporter from the U.S. Gulf Coast of crude produced in the Permian oilfield of Texas and New Mexico, the largest U.S. oil field. In 2018, it was among the top three exporters of U.S. crude, according to customs data analyzed by Reuters and interviews with company executives and employees. U.S. crude exports have emerged as a major profit center for oil companies, as shipments have skyrocketed after Washington lifted a decades-long ban of exports in late 2015. They have expanded faster than many expected, to a record at about 3.6 million bpd last month. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2F0CVck) The U.S. production boom has upended global supply and overwhelmed efforts by OPEC to restrict output. U.S. exports have doubled from the end of 2017, a lucrative opportunity for companies with access to supply and export terminals. Occidental plans to double crude exports to 600,000 barrels per day by 2020, Cynthia Walker, senior vice president midstream and marketing, said in an interview. “As we move into the end of this year and early in 2020 ... we’ll probably see a doubling of exports over that period of time,” she said. Company-level data on exports is kept secret, and the U.S. Census Bureau does not provide data, citing a law which protects confidentiality. Occidental exports about 300,000 bpd of oil, roughly 10 percent of U.S. crude exports, a standout among the myriad trading houses, oil producers and shippers with operations in the Permian. According to limited U.S. Customs data available on Refinitiv Eikon, other top shippers included Koch Supply and Trading, BP Plc’s trading arm and Trafigura AG. Occidental produces significant volumes of oil in the Permian, and its marketing arm buys barrels from other Permian shale producers. It also has contracts for long-term shipments on pipelines and access to storage and export terminals. “We touch anywhere between 20 and 25 percent of every barrel that’s produced in the Permian basin,” Walker said. U.S. oil production has risen by more than 2 million bpd in the last 12 months, also to an all-time high of over 12 million bpd, according to U.S. Energy Department data. Given the country consumes several million barrels more than that daily, many analysts had expected slower growth. Companies are scrambling to build Gulf Coast ports to handle more than 3 million bpd in new supplies expected over the next five years. Profits at Occidental’s midstream and marketing segment, which includes exports, surged more than 17-fold to $1.9 billion in 2018, excluding items, mostly thanks to moving crude from the Permian to the refining and export hub in the Gulf Coast. Still, as oil retreated to around $50 a barrel last year, Occidental shares tracked that weakness and ended 2018 down more than 15 percent. Occidental’s rivals last year ran into bottlenecks trying to get barrels from Permian to the Gulf Coast for export due to scant pipeline access. Regional prices slumped, even as the price of U.S. oil futures rose to more than $75 a barrel at one point. The bottleneck has since eased as companies expanded pipelines. Occidental’s marketing arm has a 10-year service agreement with BridgeTex pipeline, a key conduit to move crude from the Permian. The company secured a deal for 200,000 bpd of space in 2012 and has helped finance the line’s construction. Chief Executive Officer Vicki Hollub said during an earnings call last year that Occidental needed to partner with Magellan Midstream to build the line, and it has had access ever since. Last year, Oxy not only sent its own barrels, but bought those of others, using its marketing arm. Occidental Energy Marketing accounted for 17 percent of rival Permian producer Pioneer Natural Resources Co’s oil and gas revenues in 2018, according to regulatory filings. Occidental also represented 34 percent of sales from barrels Pioneer buys from other companies. The company also had the advantage of owning and operating a terminal in Ingleside, Corpus Christi, which it bought in 2012. Oxy began testing supertanker export capabilities in 2017. It later sold the terminal to Moda Midstream but retained a 10-year contract for 450,000 bpd of exports there. The company has the ability to send about 470,000 bpd out of the Permian via pipelines and expects to add more capacity in 2019, Hollub said at an industry conference last year. In December, the port partially loaded its first supertanker: Nasiriyah chartered by Occidental for Europe. This helped slash costs for ship-to-ship transfers, a costly endeavor that has limited U.S. exports because most Gulf terminals are not deep enough to handle the supertankers, known as Very Large Crude Carrier (VLCC) which can transport 2 million barrels of oil. “We don’t worry at all about access,” Walker said, adding that the company has a 75-cent per barrel advantage on loading costs due to the loading efficiencies at the Ingleside terminal. To boost its export capability, Moda is expanding its storage and considering building a second berth for VLCCs. “We’re trying to get as much to the Gulf and get it out of there,” a source at Occidental said. He added: “We have the place that is easily accessible - at Ingleside - that really is what they’re using to market to these foreign players in Asia.”"

-16.749542553218394," Occidental Petroleum profit beats on Permian, midstream strength (Reuters) - Occidental Petroleum Corp on Tuesday reported a quarterly profit that beat analysts’ estimates, but forecast lower pre-tax income sequentially for its midstream and marketing unit, sending its shares down 1.9 percent after the bell. Production from its Permian resources unit rose 57 percent to 250,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) in the fourth quarter, boosted by investments in the basin, while adjusted pre-tax income from the midstream unit rose to $670 million from $129 million, a year earlier. The midstream segment’s performance was driven by wide differentials between Midland and Gulf Coast crude prices, Raymond James analyst Muhammed Ghulam said. For the first quarter of 2019, the company forecast pre-tax income of $150 million to $200 million from the unit. A surge in Permian production had led to trapped barrels in the oilfield, resulting in Midland crude trading at wide discounts to U.S. Gulf Coast prices. Occidental’s midstream unit, which has benefited from selling discounted Midland crude at higher prices, will likely see lower earnings going forward as the differentials narrow with more pipeline access in the Permian. A recovery in global oil prices since the end of 2016 led to a resurgence in U.S. shale activity centered around the Permian basin of Texas and New Mexico. The United States recently edged past Saudi Arabia and Russia to become the world’s top oil producer. Occidental said it expects a more than 30 percent growth in Permian Resources in 2019. Occidental’s average production was up about 13 percent at 700,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d). Although U.S. crude prices fell over 35 percent in the three months ended Dec. 31, they were 7 percent higher on average in the fourth quarter, compared with a year earlier. The company’s adjusted profit rose to $922 million, or $1.22 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31 from $313 million, or 41 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had estimated the company to post a profit of $1.14 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Occidental recorded impairment charges on its Qatar assets of $220 million."

3.5084275904542905," Chevron, Occidental invest in CO2 removal technology LONDON (Reuters) - Canada-based Carbon Engineering said on Wednesday it had received investment from a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corp. and the venture capital arm of Chevron Corp. for its technology that removes carbon dioxide directly from the air. Oxy Low Carbon Ventures, a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum Corporation, and Chevron Technology Ventures, the venture capital division of Chevron Corporation, have invested an undisclosed sum in Carbon Engineering’s so-called direct air capture (DAC) technology. Founded in 2009, Carbon Engineering developed technology that captures carbon dioxide (CO2) directly from the atmosphere and converts it into low-carbon fuels for transport and for use in enhanced oil recovery. The firm has been removing CO2 from the atmosphere since 2015 at a pilot plant in British Columbia and converting it into fuel since 2017. Carbon Engineering expects to reach its financing target of $60 million by the end of the first quarter, putting it on track to accelerate the commercialization of its technology, the firm told Reuters. “(...) These new investments will allow us to accelerate the deployment of our DAC and AIR TO FUELS technologies,” said Steve Oldham, chief executive of Carbon Engineering (CE). “With an increasing focus worldwide on the need for aggressive emissions reductions, CE’s technology can play a major role, and energy industry leaders like Occidental and Chevron will greatly accelerate commercialization of CE’s technology,” he added. Extracting vast amounts of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere could help to limit global warming, blamed for causing more heatwaves, wildfires, floods and rising sea levels. The costs of such technologies are high, however, and a huge number of plants would be needed to make a dent in manmade CO2 emissions."
6.463983023838391," Occidental Petroleum sees 2019 capex range of $4.4 billion-$5.3 billion (Reuters) - U.S. oil and gas producer Occidental Petroleum Corp said on Monday it expects to spend $4.4 billion to $5.3 billion this year, depending on the price of crude oil. Houston-based Oxy spent around $5 billion in 2018. The company is one of the largest producers in the Permian Basin, the biggest U.S. oil field, and made the spending announcements Monday at the Goldman Sachs Global Energy Conference. U.S. producers are under pressure from investors to rein in expenses, improve profits and return money to shareholders through dividends or share buybacks. Oxy noted in its presentation that even at a price of $40 per barrel it could maintain its dividend, keep its production level steady and not outspend its cash flow. It also said it would complete a $2 billion share repurchase program this year. At $50 crude oil, Oxy would maintain its dividend and grow oil and gas production 5 to 8 percent. Its highest 2019 oil price scenario was $60 per barrel and included spending $5 billion to $5.3 billion and boosting production 11 to 13 percent. The U.S. benchmark crude oil peaked last year at $76 per barrel but has fallen since. On Monday, West Texas Intermediate crude futures rose 56 cents to settle at $48.52 a barrel, a 1.17 percent gain.

Producers are under pressure from investors to increase production while reining in expenses. In March, investors punished the world's largest publicly traded oil producer, Exxon Mobil, after it outlined plans to double annual earnings by 2025 through heavier investments here. Houston-based Occidental, which was the biggest drag Thursday on the S&P Energy Index and earlier the second biggest on the broader S&P 500 index, boosted its spending target to $5 billion from $3.9 billion, a 28 percent increase that surprised some analysts. On an earnings call on Thursday, Chief Executive Vicki Hollub said the company’s outlays might go higher next year, to between $5 billion to $5.3 billion if oil prices, now about $67 a barrel, held above $60. “We were a bit under capital versus our peers,” Hollub said in response to a question about the magnitude of the budget increase. Occidental lowered the top end of its production guidance while boosting the lower end. Occidental now expects annual output of 650,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day to 664,000 boe/d, compared with its earlier guidance of 645,000 boe/d to 665,000 boe/d. The company also said on its conference call that it raised annual guidance for production in the Permian by 3 percent, where it plans to spend most of the increased capex. “The disproportionate raise of 2018 capex relative to production guidance are going to be a hurdle for the stock near term,” Jefferies analyst Jason Gammel said. Chief Financial Officer Cedric Burgher said the company expects increased Permian production due to improved well productivity and an increase in well count. The production gains and a sale of pipeline and oil-export assets will add about $5 billion to the company’s 2018 cash flow, he said, helping finance share repurchases and strengthening its balance sheet. Occidental had said in March that it expected its Permian shale division to break even - or generate as much cash as it spends - by the third quarter..

Occidental’s decision to shed the assets is the latest example of an oil company balking at the capital expenditure required to maintain U.S. pipelines, which have been plagued by bottlenecks and require construction of new networks. Hess Corp HES.N and Oasis Petroleum Inc OAS.N are among the companies that have sold or spun off pipelines in the past year, looking to take advantage of high valuations for these assets, which have been buoyed by the capacity constrains. Inability to transport enough oil out of the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, the largest U.S. oilfield, combined with increasing appetite for U.S. oil exports, could help Occidental sell its pipelines for top dollar, according to the sources. Occidental is working with investment bankers on an auction for the pipeline assets, added the sources, who asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Occidental representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Occidental’s midstream assets include a major U.S. crude pipeline, a stake in a gas pipeline in the Middle East, a crude export terminal in Texas, and the Centurion Pipeline, a 2,900 mile line carrying crude from the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico to Cushing, Oklahoma. A year ago, Occidental tried to find a buyer for its 50 percent stake in its Ingleside Energy Center, a crude oil storage and export terminal in Corpus Christi, Texas. That sale process was not completed, and Occidental is including the facility in its package of midstream assets, one of the sources said."
