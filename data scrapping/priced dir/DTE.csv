-4.238854584337284," U.S. utility DTE Energy to spin off gas pipeline business NEW YORK (Reuters) - DTE Energy Co DTE.N will spin off its gas pipeline business into a publicly-traded company, the Michigan utility said on Tuesday, a move that will increase its focus on providing power to consumers. DTE Midstream will be separated by mid-2021, with ownership awarded to DTE Energy shareholders via a share dividend, a structure that would prevent tax liabilities, the Detroit-based firm said in a statement. Investors welcomed the news, sending DTE Energy shares 2% higher. “This separation will unlock significant value for our shareholders, who can invest in a pure-play utility platform with strong and visible growth and also in a high-quality midstream company,” DTE Energy Chief Executive Jerry Norcia told Reuters. DTE Midstream will generate around $700 million of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) in 2020 and carry debt worth around four times that amount, according to a DTE presentation. While Norcia declined to give a valuation for DTE Midstream, a source familiar with the matter said the new company would likely be worth between $7.5 billion and $8 billion, including debt. Once separated, DTE Energy would make 90% of its earnings from its regulated utility, up from 70%. The move allows it to raise capital investment to $17 billion over five years, which is important as DTE transitions towards cleaner generation sources, the statement added. Utilities have shed non-regulated units in recent years as investors prefer the steady earnings performance of regulated power generation. Activist investment firm Elliott Management Corp said in a statement it welcomed the announcement, adding it had been talking to DTE management for “several months.” It did not disclose whether it owns shares in DTE Energy. DTE Energy serves 2.2 million electricity customers and a further 1.3 million gas consumers in Michigan. DTE Midstream transports natural gas extracted from shale basins in Appalachia and Louisiana."

5.955750108294447," DTE Energy expands pipeline unit with $2.25 billion gas network deal (Reuters) - DTE Energy’s midstream business said on Friday it would buy a natural gas gathering system and pipeline in Louisiana’s Haynesville shale formation for $2.25 billion in cash, expanding the unit’s operations to the Gulf coast. DTE Midstream, which currently focuses on the Midwest and Northeast of the United States, will acquire M5 Louisiana Holdings from Momentum Midstream and Indigo Natural Resources, which is the main producer which feeds gas into the network. The deal, which also includes a $400 million payment upon completion of a 150-mile gathering pipeline, currently under construction and due to enter service in the second half of 2020, will immediately add 15 cents to the company’s operating earnings per share in 2020, a company statement said. “The assets are located in a great demand area, the quickly growing Gulf Coast natural gas market, with excellent access to other pipeline systems,” DTE Energy CEO Jerry Norcia told analysts on a call to discuss the acquisition. DTE Energy’s shares closed 1.7% lower on Friday. The company said the acquisition would be paid for using an equal split of senior unsecured debt and mandatory convertible bonds. The purchase forms part of DTE Energy’s plan to invest between $4 billion and $5 billion into its midstream unit between 2019 and 2023, the statement said. DTE Energy has looked to expand into natural gas pipelines and storage, which provides steady cash flows even during energy price swings, at a time when advanced energy efficiency measures have made the provision of electricity less lucrative. However, DTE Energy expects to retain a long-term business mix of which between 70% and 75% will consist of its utility operations, the statement added. Reuters reported that DTE was nearing a deal to buy the gas pipeline system on Thursday, citing sources. DTE Energy was advised by Barclays, with legal assistance from Shearman & Sterling and Dechert. Jefferies and Credit Suisse served as financial advisors to Momentum, with Vinson & Elkins as its legal counsel. Kirkland & Ellis was legal advisor to Indigo."

5.955750108294447," DTE Energy nears $2.5 billion M5 Midstream acquisition: sources NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. power utility DTE Energy Co DTE.N is nearing a deal to acquire gas pipeline system M5 Midstream LLC for about $2.5 billion, expanding its business that's not tied to electricity provision, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday. Advanced energy efficiency measures have made the provision of electricity less lucrative for power companies such as DTE, which serves about 2.2 million customers in southeastern Michigan, including Detroit. In response, DTE has sought to expand its businesses that encompass natural gas pipelines and storage, because they provide steady cash flows even during energy price swings. DTE also has an energy marketing and trading business. An agreement for DTE to acquire M5 Midstream, which operates in the Haynesville shale formation spanning Louisiana and parts of East Texas, could be announced as early as Friday, the sources said, cautioning it was possible that the talks could collapse at the last minute. The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. DTE Energy didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. M5 Midstream didn’t respond to a request for comment. M5 Midstream owns pipelines that transport gas from the drilling site to larger pipes that then take it to end users, known as gathering and processing assets, as well as pipelines which move water used in shale exploration. M5 Midstream was developed by Momentum Midstream LLC, whose private equity investors include Yorktown Partners, Ridgemont Equity Partners, Magnetar Capital, GSO Capital Partners and Trilantic Capital Partners, according to its website. This would be the second time that DTE has bought a business from Momentum Midstream. In 2016, it acquired gas pipeline assets in Pennsylvania and West Virginia, dubbed M3 Midstream LLC. Last month, NextEra Energy Partners NEP.N, backed by U.S. power utility NextEra Energy Inc NEE.N, agreed a $1.4 billion deal to buy Meade Pipeline Co, a gas pipeline network that connects the Marcellus basin to the mid-Atlantic and Southeastern regions of the United States."
