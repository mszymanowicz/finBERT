3.97712828744061," Colgate reviewing Chinese toothpaste brand Darlie amid debate on racial inequality LONDON (Reuters) - Colgate-Palmolive CL.N on Thursday said it was working to review and evolve its Chinese toothpaste brand, Darlie, the latest in a string of brand reassessments amid a U.S. debate on racial inequality. Darlie is a popular Chinese brand owned by Colgate and its joint venture partner, Hawley & Hazel. Its package features a smiling man in a top hat. It used to be called Darkie and featured a man in blackface. Its current Chinese name still translates to “black person toothpaste.” The move comes as Corporate America reacts to weeks of protests over racial injustice and police brutality sparked by the death in May of George Floyd, a black man, in Minneapolis after a white police officer knelt on his neck. “For more than 35 years, we have been working together to evolve the brand, including substantial changes to the name, logo and packaging. We are currently working with our partner to review and further evolve all aspects of the brand, including the brand name,” a Colgate spokesman told Reuters in an email. Colgate's statement to Reuters followed news on Wednesday that PepsiCo Inc PEP.O was dropping its Aunt Jemima logo, prompting peers to initiate reviews of other food brands featuring African American characters, including Uncle Ben's rice, Mrs. Butterworth's syrup and Cream of Wheat. Darlie controls 17% of the toothpaste market in China, 21% in Singapore, 28% in Malaysia and 45% in Taiwan, according to Euromonitor International. Colgate paid $50 million in 1985 for 50 percent of Hong Kong-based Hawley & Hazel, the maker of Darkie. It announced changes to the logo and English name in 1989 following pressure from shareholders and other groups."

1.4911473645526068," Colgate to buy U.S. vegan toothpaste maker (Reuters) - Colgate-Palmolive Co CL.N said on Thursday it would buy Hello Products LLC, a company which bills itself as a maker of eco-friendly and animal cruelty-free toothpastes, in a push to tap into a growing base of environmentally conscious consumers. Hello Products, founded in 2009, sells various lines of vegan toothpastes and mouthwashes, some which are infused with hemp seed oil - another benefit for Colgate as demand for products based on cannabis derivatives grows. Millenial and Gen Z consumers are growing increasingly picky of their everyday products as they look at the environmental impact of the manufacturing process, forcing companies to take steps to reduce their carbon footprint and seek new plant-based sourcing options. Colgate launched its first “vegan-certified” toothpaste earlier this month. Most toothpastes cannot be classified as vegan as they contain glycerin, which is usually made from animal fat. Hello Products toothpastes, which are priced as high as $6.99, are sold only in the United States, though food and drug retailers and on an online subscription-based model. Colgate did not disclose the value of the deal, expected to close by February, but said it would finance the transaction with a combination of cash and debt."
-6.118387942155567," Colgate warns Venezuelans not to buy fake imported toothpaste brands CARACAS (Reuters) - Colgate-Palmolive Co CL.N is warning Venezuelans not buy fake versions of its toothpaste brands, leading local authorities to issue a health warning, as demand for imported products in Venezuela's dysfunctional economy encourages the spread of knock-off goods. Colgate, in a statement on Monday, said it had alerted Venezuelan health authorities to the potential risk of the “commercialization and use of these falsified products,” without giving further details. The Venezuelan National Hygiene Institute said it had determined that some toothpastes claiming to be from Colgate did not contain fluoride. Their use posed a health risk because of possible microbiological contamination, the institute said in a public report. The institute did not mention any reports of health problems but asked Venezuelans to report any that occur. The fake toothpaste had been imported from China, Mexico and Thailand and had the same color scheme and design as some of Colgate’s genuine brands available in Venezuela, the institute said. Colgate in its Monday statement said buyers could identify the genuine products because the text on the tube and box are in Spanish and show an official sanitary permit. The institute did not provide details about the number of fake Colgate products in Venezuela or identify the companies producing the toothpaste. Colgate did not respond to Reuters’ requests for further comment. Venezuela’s hyperinflationary economic collapse has shuttered most local producers of dental products, stimulating demand for imports of hard-to-find consumer goods like Colgate toothpaste. Many imported goods are sold in black-market stores that do not assess products’ quality. “Several friends have told me to take care, that there are toothpaste brands that damage the gums,” Rosa Arias, 61, a maintenance worker, said while shopping at a kiosk in eastern Caracas."

Filorga’s anti-aging skin care products are sold in over 60 countries, with its largest markets being France, Italy, Spain and Greater China. “This acquisition also provides Colgate entry into the fast-growing and sizeable travel retail channel, particularly in Asia,” Chief Executive Officer Noel Wallace said. Colgate, which is known for its dental-care products, is looking to expand its presence in the high-margin personal care business and had acquired skin-care brands PCA Skin and EltaMD in 2017. The Filorga transaction will be financed with a combination of debt and cash and is currently expected to close in the third quarter, Colgate said, adding that the deal is expected to have no impact on its diluted earnings per share in 2019. Citi was Colgate’s financial adviser, while Goldman Sachs and BNP Paribas advised Filorga."

11.773125065829111," Colgate-Palmolive expects profit to decline in 2019 (Reuters) - Colgate-Palmolive Co CL.N forecast a surprise drop in 2019 profit on Friday, blaming higher raw material costs and a stronger dollar, sending its shares down 3 percent. Like other consumer goods companies, the world’s largest toothpaste maker has struggled with rising commodity and transportation costs, forcing it to raise prices in regions like Latin America, where it makes the bulk of its revenue. Higher prices crimped demand, especially in Brazil and Argentina, where Colgate faces stiff competition from Procter & Gamble's PG.N Oral-B and Unilever's ULVR.L Close Up. To keep its market share, the company said it would spend more on advertising in fiscal 2019, but expects that, along with higher raw material costs and fluctuating foreign exchange rates, to lead to a mid-single-digit decline in earnings per share for the year. Analysts were expecting a 2.4 percent rise in earnings per share for the year, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. “Our outlook reflects an increase in raw material prices, an increase in our tax rate year-over-year and the uncertainty surrounding the global economy, exchange rates and pricing,” Chief Executive Officer Ian Cook said in a statement. Even in North America, where Colgate recorded strong fourth-quarter sales, economists have predicted that a consumer boom - set off by tax cuts, rising incomes and buoyant stock markets - could be fading due to a U.S. government shutdown, higher interest rates and trade tensions. The company, which boasts of a 42 percent share of the global toothpaste market, expects net sales for 2019 to be flat to up low-single digits, compared with analysts expectations of a 0.1 percent fall. For the fourth quarter, Colgate reported an adjusted net income of $638 million, down 3 percent from a year earlier. On a per-share basis, it earned 74 cents, beating analysts’ estimates of 73 cents. Net sales in three months ended Dec. 31 fell 2.1 percent to $3.81 billion, but beat estimates of $3.77 billion, according to Refinitiv’s IBES. Shares of the company were set to open down 2.7 percent to $60.50 in early trading, adding to a 19 percent decline its stock has seen over the past 52 weeks."

-0.015967736427615894," Colgate halts Venezuela detergent plant for lack of boxes VALENCIA, Venezuela (Reuters) - U.S. consumer goods maker Colgate-Palmolive Co CL.N has halted production at its detergent and dish soap plant in Venezuela because it lacked cardboard boxes to ship products, a union leader said on Thursday. The plant in the city of Valencia stopped operations on Monday, union representative Carlos Rodriguez said in a telephone interview. Its cardboard provider, Ireland's Smurfit Kappa SKG.I, halted production in Venezuela last month after government authorities took over its local unit. Smurfit Kappa was one of the few remaining shipping materials manufacturers in the OPEC nation. Colgate is attempting to import cardboard from neighboring Colombia, Rodriguez said. Rodriguez said the lack of cardboard prompted the company to push up vacations for the plant’s 77 workers. He said a Colgate toothpaste plant was still operating, but had enough cardboard stock to cover only one more month of production. “If (the toothpaste plant) does not get the cardboard, its operations will also be suspended,” Rodriguez said. Colgate-Palmolive did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company has five plants in Venezuela, including a soap factory that stopped operations more than a year ago. Multinationals in Venezuela have drastically scaled back operations as the socialist government’s currency controls have made obtaining raw materials difficult, and an economic collapse marked by spiraling hyperinflation has dented demand."

-10.026420404119998," Colgate-Palmolive to raise prices as raw materials costs surge (Reuters) - Colgate-Palmolive Co CL.N said on Friday that it would ""modestly"" raise prices in the second-half of the year, mainly in emerging markets, as the world's largest toothpaste maker seeks relief from surging raw materials costs. Big packaged goods companies have been struggling to grow sales amid fierce pricing competition between retailers and as shoppers turn increasingly to fresher brands. The industry also has been rocked this year by rising commodities and transportation prices. Shares in Colgate were flat on Friday, reversing course from a 3 percent decline after the company reported weaker-than-expected quarterly sales and warned that it expected slower full-year net sales growth. Colgate, which makes Speed Stick deodorants and Softsoap hand-wash, said raw material inflation had hurt second-quarter gross margins by 320 basis points. “Rising commodity costs and volatile exchange rates put pressure on our P&L, and we have sometimes questioned if we’re responding with an appropriate sense of urgency,” Chief Executive Ian Cook said on a call to discuss earnings. Cook said Colgate had started raising prices around the world, and expects to see a modest improvement in second-half pricing. “We may not see competitors follow immediately, and we intend to remain rational, but we also understand the need to protect our market shares,” he said. Cook’s concerns echo those made this week by Kleenex-maker Kimberly-Clark, which flagged higher commodities costs, and said it had raised prices and expected to continue to do so for the rest of the year. Procter & Gamble Co PG.N, the world's second-largest consumer goods company and the maker of Oral-B dental products, is expected by analysts to report a rise in quarterly sales and earnings next week. Colgate’s second-quarter sales rose 1.6 percent but missed estimates, hurt by a trucker strike in Brazil and weakness in Latin American currencies amid political uncertainty and a strong U.S. dollar. “While expectations were low heading into the print, we see few positives in today’s release,” Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog said. Sales in Latin America, which account for nearly a quarter of Colgate’s total revenue, fell 7 percent to $933 million in the second-quarter. Colgate said it would have moved more products had it not been for the strike, which emptied roads and left major cities running short on food, gasoline and other basic commodities. Net income attributable to Colgate rose to $637 million, or 73 cents per share, in the second quarter ended June 30. Including one-time items, the company earned 77 cents per share, in line with analysts’ estimates."

0.7651005850592429," Colgate's sales disappoint on tepid Latin America demand (Reuters) - Colgate-Palmolive Co CL.N said first-quarter sales came in below its expectations due to stagnant demand in Latin America - its biggest market - leading it to lower a widely watched sales forecast. U.S. packaged goods companies have been struggling with lower demand and price tensions with retailers, who are tightening inventories, offering discounts and focusing on private label brands to trim costs. Even though Colgate spent nearly 13 percent more on advertising this quarter over the prior quarter, and cut prices between 0.5 percent and 2.5 percent in Europe and North America compared with a year ago, organic sales did not see the boost they expected. Growth in organic sales, that exclude benefits from acquisitions and divestitures, slowed to 1.5 percent in the first quarter from more than 2 percent in the previous quarter as the company saw no growth in volumes in developing markets. The company said it now expects these core sales to grow in the low-single-digit percentage range in 2018, compared with the low- to mid-single-digit growth it projected earlier. The company’s shares fell 3 percent to a 14-month low of $64.85 but pared most of those losses to trade down 0.3 percent. The weaker top-line results are certainly not a huge surprise in light of the tepid results reported by Colgate’s peers, Suntrust Robinson analyst William Chappell said, but added that Colgate’s miss on sales was a surprise. Colgate’s net sales rose 6.4 percent to $4 billion, but came in slightly below the average analyst estimate of $4.02 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales in Latin America rose just 0.5 percent to $929 million, hit by a slump in demand in Mexico, but pricing cuts in Europe and North America reversed some of the weakness. Procter & Gamble Co PG.N earlier this month also posted organic sales growth that disappointed Wall Street, mainly because of pricing pressures in an environment where retailers are cutting back on costs. Still, Colgate's stock has outperformed peers. While the S&P 500 Household Products .SPLRCPROD index has fallen more than 18 percent in this year, Colgate shares are down 12 percent. In comparison, P&G's shares are down 21 percent. Excluding some items, Colgate earned 74 cents per share, above analysts’ average estimate of 72 cents."
