-20.98093304734111," UPDATE 1-Brazil lawmakers approve new sanitation bill, opening room to privatizations (Adds analysts, shares) BRASILIA/SAO PAULO, June 25 (Reuters) - Brazil’s Senate late on Wednesday approved a new sanitation bill, in a move that is expected to prompt states and municipalities to privatize water and sewage companies, luring investors. The bill, which needs President Jair Bolsonaro’s approval to become law, foresees the universalization of sanitation services by 2033, which would require 700 billion reais ($131.72 billion) in capital expenditure, according to Banco BTG Pactual SA’s estimates. “The approval is a huge step in the improvement of the precarious condition of our basic sanitation system, where 16% of Brazilians - almost 35 million people - don’t have access to clean water and almost half of our population don’t have access to sewage collection,” BTG’s analysts wrote in a note to clients. Still, analysts at UBS Group AG say the sanitation sector may take up to two years to unlock value, as new regulations are needed. Analysts see state-run Sabesp and Copasa as the companies with the highest chances of being privatized soon, as the governors of Sao Paulo and Minas Gerais states have already revealed plans to do so. Despite the approval of the bill, shares in utility companies Sabesp, Copasa and Sanepar were underperforming the Bovespa stock exchange index, down 0.98%, 0.68% and 1.4%, respectively, in midmorning trading, after weeks of gains on the prospect of the bill’s approval.

-45.4608941803444," Brazil 2019 equity offering surge could be just the start, bankers say SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian stock offerings may more than double in value this year from a bumper 2019, with the country’s lowest interest rates on record seen fueling optimism and leading more companies to test the markets, bankers say. Despite a history of market volatility over the past decade, many are hoping that a less interventionist government under conservative President Jair Bolsonaro could give the current boom staying power. “Brazilian capital markets have entered a long-term growth cycle that may last years,” said Fabio Nazari, head of equity capital markets at Banco BTG Pactual SA. After more than tripling last year, share offerings activity tmsnrt.rs/2FO3yk9 is expected to accelerate, with some bankers predicting that offerings may reach up to 200 billion reais ($48 billion). Brazilian stock sales were equivalent to 85% of all equity activity in Latin America in 2019, while Brazil’s gross domestic product is only about a third of the wider region’s. Privatizations or government stake divestitures, particularly of units previously owned by state-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA PETR4.SA, helped fuel the growth. Fuel distributor Petrobras Distribuidora SA BRDT3.SA was privatized through a $2.5 billion share offering. In the year's largest M&A deal, Petrobras sold gas pipeline company TAG to France's Engie SA ENGIE.PA for $8.6 billion. State divestitures will again dominate the markets this year, as development bank BNDES plans to sell up to 120 billion reais in shares it owns in listed companies such as meatpacker JBS SA JBSS3.SA, Petrobras and Banco do Brasil SA BBAS3.SA. Most of last year’s 56 share offerings came from already-listed companies, with only seven initial public offerings among the transactions. This year may see up to 20 IPOs, said Roderick Greenlees, head of investment banking at Itau Unibanco Holding SA. Some long-dormant industries such as homebuilding are coming back to the market, said Eddy Allegaert, head of equity capital markets for Latin America at JPMorgan & Chase. Two property developers, Mitre and Moura Dubeux, have filed for IPOs so far. Morgan Stanley managing director Eduardo Mendez expects IPO candidates to include fintechs as well as consumer products and retail companies. Brazil is expected to remain the region’s largest source of equity issues during the year, but Allegaert also expects some equity deals in Mexico. The outlook is more difficult in Argentina, where a sharp left turn politically and debt default worries have spooked investors. M&A GROWTH Bankers expect a more moderate increase in M&A activity, including an expected multibillion-dollar sale of Petrobras refineries, the long-awaited privatization of power holding company Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA ELET6.SA and some divestitures by Banco do Brasil. Cash-starved regional water and sanitation providers like Sabesp SBSP3.SA, which the state of Sao Paulo has pledged to privatize, could be another source of growth. “Water and sanitation will require a massive amount of investments, similar to what the power industry has attracted over the last 20 years, since the first privatizations,” said Eduardo Miras, Brazil head of investment banking at Citi. Andres Sommer, head of M&A for South America at Morgan Stanley, also expects large deals in the power industry, while Ricardo Lacerda, founding partner of BR Partners, sees more activity in infrastructure, retail and consumer industries. As companies raise cash in capital markets and the economy recovers, private M&A is expected to pick up, too, with foreign investors accounting for part of the demand. “There’s a perception that Brazil’s economic recovery is solid, which is boosting foreign investors’ interest in acquiring companies there,” said Renato Boranga, head of mergers and acquisitions at Banco Santander Brasil SA."
-2.6599583213396785," Brazilian sewage co Igua Saneamento mulls IPO: sources SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian sanitation company Iguá Saneamento SA is considering an initial public offering (IPO) to raise money for investments, three people with knowledge of the matter said. The company is discussing a potential offering with the investment banking units of Banco Bradesco SA BBDC4.SA, Itau Unibanco Holding SA ITUB4.SA, Banco BTG Pactual SA BPAC3.SA and Banco Santander Brasil SA SANB11.SA, the sources said. No final decision has been made. Iguá declined on Wednesday to comment on a potential IPO. The company currently runs 18 sewage and water concessions and public-private partnerships in five Brazilian states, serving 6.6 million people. Its first-quarter revenue rose nearly 45% from a year earlier to 216 million reais. Still, net income fell 48% to 4.3 million as the company spent more on construction projects. Canada’s Alberta Investment Management Corporation (AIMCo) injected 400 million reais into Iguá Saneamento a year ago, acquiring an undisclosed stake in the company through an investment vehicle. Iguá’s main shareholders include private equity funds managed by Brazilian firm IG4 Capital and also the state development bank BNDES, through its holding company BNDESPar. The sanitation company was divested by the group controlling Galvão Engenharia SA, one of the Brazilian construction conglomerates forced to sell assets after it was entangled in the sweeping Car Wash corruption investigation. Still, the sale of a remaining stake in Iguá occurred this month. If Iguá succeeds in listing its shares, it will join three other sanitation companies on the Sao Paulo stock exchange: Sabesp SA SBSP3.SA, Copasa SA CSMG3.SA and Sanepar SA SAPR4.SA."

6.554110856333599," Brazil stock market hits record high on Bolsonaro's potential reforms SAO PAULO, Jan 4 (Reuters) - Brazil’s stock and currency markets have romped into the New Year, lifted by growing confidence in the still-to-be-detailed economic policies of newly inaugurated far-right Brazil President Jair Bolsonaro. Investor euphoria about potential free market reforms and privatizations four days into Bolsonaro’s presidency has lifted the country’s benchmark Bovespa index close to 5 percent to an all-time high, making it the best performing among major indexes worldwide. “The Brazilian market has started the year very strongly, with a generalized optimism about the new government outweighing global concerns about economic deceleration in the U.S. and China,” said Pablo Spyer, director of Sao Paulo-based brokerage Mirae. Bolsonaro - a former congressman and army captain who has surrounded himself with a cadre of generals and orthodox economists - campaigned on free-market promises of cost-cutting and privatizations. Stock market gains have been led by companies like state-controlled utility Eletrobras, which has jumped 26 percent over three sessions. Newly named Energy and Mines Minister Bento Albuquerque said he might issue new shares in the company, diluting the government’s stake to the point where it no longer controls the company. Another big winner has been Sabesp, the water and sewage company for Brazil’s most affluent state, Sao Paulo. Its shares are up 20 percent, the Bovespa’s second-highest surge after the state’s top finance official, former central banker Henrique Meirelles, said he would evaluate the possibility of privatizing the company. Meanwhile, Brazil’s real currency, up around 4.5 percent so far this year, is the second-best performing in the world. In 2018, the real weakened almost 15 percent. Despite investor optimism, Bolsonaro has offered few details about his economic policies, beyond what he had already said on the campaign trail. But a major challenge ahead for the new leader and his economics czar, University of Chicago-trained economist Paulo Guedes, will be pushing through an unpopular pension reform that economists say is crucial to reducing Brazil’s ballooning budget deficit, which hit almost $35 billion, or over 7 percent of GDP, in 2018. Without that, any recent market gains might prove ephemeral. Bolsonaro said on Friday at an Air Force event that he aimed to raise the age of retirement for men to 62 years old and to 57 for women, effective five years after any legislation is passed. His chief of staff, Onyx Lorenzoni, later said those details might be reworked, however. On Wednesday, Guedes said he was committed to the pension reform, to cutting taxes and was evaluating a wave of privatizations, but added few details. Analysts with Brazil bank BTG Pactual wrote in a report timed with Bolsonaro’s inauguration that pension reform must happen soon. The Bolsonaro administration “must submit to Congress, in its initial period in power, a thorough pension reform and push hard for approval,” they wrote. “This is no easy task and will require political coordination that the new administration may or may not have.” (Reporting by Marcelo Rochabrun Editing by Tom Brown)"
