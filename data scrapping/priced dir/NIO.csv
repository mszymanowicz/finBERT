-39.20255439868334," Nio launches first electric sedan model as Tesla delivers China-built SUV CHENGDU, China/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese electric vehicle (EV) maker Nio Inc is taking on conventional gasoline premium automakers from BMW to Audi further, launching on Saturday its first sedan model as it eyes a greater share of the world’s largest car market. The launch of the ET7, at an event in the western city of Chengdu, came as rival Tesla started selling its China-made Model Y sport-utility vehicle in the Chinese market. Nio is aiming to expand its product lineup to attract more customers. In China’s passenger car market, sedans and SUVs each make up around 46% of overall sales. Chief Executive William Li said Nio’s new battery technology will give the ET7 a drive range of over 1,000 km (621 miles) between charges. The starting price will be 378,000 yuan ($58,378) for the car without the battery pack, one of the most expensive EV components, which can then be leased from the company. With the battery pack, the starting price is 448,000 yuan. Li said in an interview ET7’s target rivals were BMW’s 5-series, Audi’s A6 and Mercedes-Benz E-class sedans. It was “reasonable” that Nio could sell similar amount of ET7 as BMW’s 5-series sedans in China in the future, Li said, but gave no details of timeframe. The starting price for the BMW 5-series is 426,900 yuan and BMW sells over 10,000 of them each month in China. Li said the ET7 will be fitted with lidar sensors - which help the car perceive its surroundings, and are often found in autonomous cars - to assist drivers, a technology dismissed by Tesla Inc’s outspoken chief Elon Musk. The Californian automaker, which is selling Shanghai-made Model 3 sedans, has just started selling its Model Y vehicles at a starting price of 339,900 yuan. It uses cameras for driver assistance. Nio, which delivered 43,728 vehicles last year, has a market capitalisation of over $92 billion, surpassing conventional automakers Daimler AG and General Motors Co. Investors have poured billions of dollars into electric vehicle development. Li said “it is not a bad thing” when asked about the high market value of the firm, but added Nio is still relatively a small company compared to established firms like BMW in terms of sales volume. It is currently selling three SUV models built at a car factory in China’s eastern city of Hefei. On Thursday, Nio’s rival Xpeng Inc announced plans to roll out a new sedan model. It currently has a sedan and an SUV in its lineup. ($1 = 6.4750 Chinese yuan renminbi)"
34.31327795526755," Nio stock falls after short-seller Citron targets EV maker (Reuters) - Shares of electric vehicle maker Nio Inc reversed course to trade lower on Friday after short-seller Citron Research recommended investors to sell the stock, citing pricing pressure posed by bigger rival Tesla Inc in the Chinese market. Nio’s ES6 hatchback model faces imminent threat from likely price cuts for Tesla’s Model Y in China, Andrew Left-owned Citron said in an investor note. Left has long targeted companies that he thinks are over-valued. Friday’s take is a reversal to the firm’s original recommendation two years ago, when it urged investors to buy the stock. “Anyone buying NIO stock now is not buying a company or its prospects, rather you are buying 3 letters that move on a screen,” Citron said in the note. Nio did not respond to a request for comment. Tesla has cut prices in China on several occasions, aiming to gain more market share in the world’s biggest car market. Currently, China-made Model Y has an estimated price of 488,000 yuan ($73,895) in the country, according to Tesla’s website. Citron assigned a $25 price target on the Nio stock on Friday, implying a 48% downside to its last closing price. The stock rose as much as 12.2% earlier in the session after upbeat quarterly results from peer Li Auto. Nio, which has risen more than 12-fold this year, was down nearly 1% at $47.79 in late morning trade. “It is long buying and not short covering which is driving NIO’s price move,” Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at New York-based S3 Partners, told Reuters. Short sellers, who have bet that Nio’s stock price will fall, have logged $3.5 billion in mark-to-market losses this year, according to S3 Partners."

The service, called “battery as a service” (BaaS), entails drivers paying a monthly rental fee for use of the batteries. The cheapest Nio car after subsidies is now an ES6 sport-utility vehicle (SUV) priced 273,600 yuan ($39,553) without ownership of the battery pack, versus 343,600 yuan including the pack. “We believe with BaaS, more customers of gasoline cars will consider electric vehicles,” Nio’s chief executive William Li told reporters. Nio operates 143 battery-swapping stations around China, where drivers can swap spent battery packs for fully charged replacements. Li said Nio was building a new battery-swapping station in China every week and planned to build 300 new stations next year. Li also said the firm hoped to enter some international markets from the second half of next year starting with some European countries. He added the firm aimed to enter more markets from 2022. The industry ministry has said it would promote the adoption of vehicles with batteries that can be swapped between different makes and models. To that end, Nio's battery packs are the same shape and size across its lineup, which is comprised of three SUVs. EV models from peer BAIC BluePark New Energy Technology Co Ltd 600733.SS also have standardised batteries.

U.S.-listed shares of the company, that have surged nearly four-fold this year, were up about 12% at $15.87 in premarket trading. “The current constraints on the productions will be lifted in the near future and we are confident that our production capacity can meet the accelerated demand of our models,” Chief Executive Officer William Bin Li said in a statement. The pandemic-hit auto industry in China is recovering, with sales in July climbing 16.4%, marking the fourth month of gains as demand in the world’s biggest vehicle market picks up. Nio said it delivered a total of 3,533 of its ES8 and ES6 sport-utility electric vehicles in July, a jump of about 322% year-over-year.

The company’s shares fell 3% in early New York trading. Auto sales in China tumbled 31% in the first four months of this year from a year earlier as the coronavirus outbreak disrupted production and delivery of vehicles. Li said the company’s overall gross margin was expected to reach 3% in the second quarter, from -12.2% in the first, as the cost of battery packs, a key component, drops. Nio delivered 3,838 vehicles in the first quarter ended March 31, down from 3,989 vehicles in the same period of 2019. Sales from vehicles fell 18.2% to 1.26 billion yuan, the company said. However, the company, which is seen as a rival to Tesla Inc, added that growth in orders since late April has rebounded to levels seen before the virus outbreak. Nio said it expects to deliver 9,500 to 10,000 vehicles in the second quarter, while Li expects monthly production in China’s eastern Hefei city to reach 4,500 to 5,000 units in August or September."

The new investment will will smooth its cash flow and guarantee future product developments, Chief Executive William Li told a news conference, adding it will not impact its existing partnerships with Changan [SASAGG.UL] and GAC or the ownership structure of its New York-listed company. The investors include state-controlled Hefei Construction Investment Holding (Group) Co Ltd, CMG-SDIC Capital Management Co Ltd, and Anhui High and New Technology Industrial Investment Co Ltd. Nio makes ES8 and ES6 electric sport-utility vehicles in the eastern city of Hefei with state-owned JAC. The plant has capacity to build 120,000 cars annually. Nio sold 20,500 cars last year. Li said the coronavirus epidemic had an impact on Nio’s supply chain and sales in the first quarter but said the negative impact had passed. Nio delivered 3,838 vehicles in the first three months of this year, and sales and production were recovering in March compared to February. In a statement, the firm said Nio will inject its core businesses and assets in China, which are valued at 17.77 billion yuan, into Nio China and invest 4.16 billion yuan in it. Nio will hold 75.9% of the new firm, and investors the rest, once the transactions are completed. “Today’s deal removes near-term solvency risk surrounding NIO, and likely means investors can refocus on things like volumes and margins,” analysts at Bernstein said in a note. The headquarters of Nio China are planned in the Hefei Economic and Technological Development Area. Nio would consider expanding capacity in Hefei if sales demand grows. In February, Nio said it signed framework agreements with the Hefei city government to raise funds in excess of 10 billion yuan.

Cash-strapped electric vehicle (EV) maker Nio is the most prominent among dozens of Chinese electric vehicle startups vying to become the next Tesla Inc.

Loss-making Nio is in talks with Hefei, the capital city of Anhui province, where it is building cars with local automaker JAC, to build research centres and car plants. Nio will provide details in the next two months, it said. “We think the news puts speculation around Nio’s funding issues to bed – at least in the foreseeable future,” said Bernstein analyst Robin Zhu in a note, adding Nio’s cash burn would remain significant in the foreseeable future. “We remain dubious over the company’s fundamental outlook, and remain concerned about Tesla competition,” Zhu added. Under cash flow pressure, Nio said in May last year it would form a joint venture with Beijing E-Town International Investment and Development Co.

The U.S.-listed electric car startup, which last month flagged an urgent need for more funding, said on Wednesday it was exploring financing and strategic opportunities with Guangzhou Automobile (GAC Group). Nio did not specify the size of the potential funding but earlier in the day Sina Finance and other media reported it was in talks for up to $1 billion, sending its shares up as much as 17% in heavy trade. GAC Group said in a statement that the potential financing of up to $150 million would include funds it would raise itself and not have a material impact on its own finances. It also said that there is “still great uncertainty as to whether an agreement can be reached.” Shares in GAC Group fell more than 1% in morning trade. Nio declined to comment on GAC’s statement. Nio on Dec. 30 warned in its quarterly report that the company did not have adequate cash for continuous operation in the next 12 months and it was looking for external financing. Electric-car makers are battling uncertain demand in the world’s largest car market as the government rolls back subsidies amid criticism that some firms have become overly reliant on government funding.

The loss-making electric carmaker said its sales improved in September and that it delivered 4,799 vehicles in the quarter ended Sept. 30 compared with 3,553 deliveries in the second quarter. This comes at a time when electric car makers are battling an uncertain demand in China, the world’s largest car market, as it rolls back subsidies on new energy vehicles amid criticism that some firms have become overly reliant on the funds. China’s Nio had said subsidies for its pricier ES8 model, a seven-seater sport-utility electric vehicle that is widely seen as a rival to Tesla Inc’s Model X, were slashed by nearly 83% starting June. Adding to its woes, Nio on Monday warned it did not have adequate cash for “continuous operation in the next 12 months” and was looking to obtain external financing. The company, which counts Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings and Hillhouse Capital Management as its shareholders, raised $1 billion last year in an initial public offering that valued it at $6.4 billion. In May, Nio signed a pact with a government-backed fund for an investment of about $1.5 billion.

Nio Chief Executive Officer William Bin Li, however, sees little threat from that. “If you compare the Model 3 with our products, we believe our product is still very competitive,” he said. The company expects to deliver over 8,000 units in the fourth quarter. Excluding items, Nio posted a smaller-than-expected loss of 2.38 yuan per share in the third quarter compared with the average analyst estimate of a loss of 2.43 yuan.

The company reported a second-quarter loss of $478.6 million, 25.2% more than its first-quarter loss, after the recall of 4,803 vehicles in June. Nio’s revenues fell 8% to 1.41 billion yuan ($198.40 million) from 1.54 billion yuan in the preceding quarter. Nio sold 3,140 ES8 cars, down from 3,989 in the first quarter. It sold just 413 of its cheaper ES6 model. Nick Wang, Nio Group’s head of finance, said the company’s gross margins “will still be negative for the rest of the year.” But Chief Financial Officer Tung-June Hsieh said Nio has made “significant, positive progress” in its latest fund-raising efforts, without providing details. In May, Nio signed a pact with a government-backed fund for an investment of about $1.5 billion. Nio also announced a $200 million private placement of convertible notes, split equally between early investor Tencent Holdings and founder Li. Nio had $503.4 million in cash on the balance sheet as of June 30. To help cope with cash burn, Nio is expanding its sales network with smaller showrooms called Nio Spaces, according to Hsieh. Nio Spaces “will allow us to quickly, cost-effectively and meaningfully increase the number of sale points in the market,” Hsieh said. “By the end of 2019, we aim to have established around 200 Nio Spaces in over 100 cities across China.” Nio will also encourage more regionally driven promotion, introduce a vehicle subscription program and push sales to corporate users and fleet operators. After reducing headcount to around 7,800 by the end of the third quarter from over 9,900 in January, Nio plans further headcount reduction by the end of this year through both restructuring and spinning off some business units, Hsieh said. Nationally, sales of new energy vehicles, including EVs, contracted for the second month in a row in August, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. Nio led a pack of EV startups and became the first to get internationally listed. It counts Tencent and investor Hillhouse Capital Management among its shareholders and raised $1 billion last year in an initial public offering that valued it at $6.4 billion.

In an unusual move, Nio canceled a scheduled earnings conference call on Tuesday. But it rescheduled the call on Wednesday after the company’s shares touched a record low of $1.97. The company, is the most prominent among dozens of Chinese electric vehicle startups hoping to emulate Tesla, reported a second-quarter loss of $478.6 million, 25.2% more than its first-quarter loss, after the recall of 4,803 vehicles in June.

16.589861751152068," Tesla rival Nio tumbles to record low after deliveries disappoint (Reuters) - U.S.-listed shares of Tesla rival Nio Inc NIO.N tumbled 25% on Tuesday after the Chinese electric carmaker posted a drop in quarterly vehicle sales, blaming a cut in subsidies and weak demand. China has been steadily rolling back subsidies on new energy vehicles, with plans to phase them out after 2020 amid criticism that some firms have become overly reliant on the funds. This has raised prices of electric vehicles, resulting in a slowdown in sales. Sales of new energy vehicles, which comprise electric battery cars as well as plug-in electric hybrids, fell 4.7% in July from a year earlier, witnessing their first drop in more than two years, according to here data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM). Nio said earlier this year subsidies for its ES8 car, a pure-electric, seven-seat sport-utility vehicle seen as a rival to Tesla’s Model X, were slashed to 11,520 yuan ($1,620.87) beginning June 26 from 67,500 yuan last year. “The China subsidy cut has been well understood by investors, so all China EV producers are looking at a weak 2H19,” Roth Capital analyst Craig Irwin said. Nio, whose second-quarter losses nearly doubled, also canceled its post-earnings conference call, saying the earnings statement had the required information. The company counts Chinese internet giant Tencent Holdings 0700.HK and Hillhouse Capital Management as its shareholders, and raised $1 billion last year in an initial public offering that valued it at $6.4 billion. In May, Nio signed a pact with a government-backed fund for an investment of about $1.5 billion. (reut.rs/2ldpU8j) Nio also plans to reduce its global headcount to 7,800 by the end of the third quarter from the 10,000 employees it had in January. Reuters had reported on the job cuts last month. The company said its vehicle sales fell nearly 8% to 1.41 billion yuan ($198.40 million) from 1.54 billion yuan in the preceding quarter. Nio sold 3,140 ES8 cars in the quarter, down from 3,989 in the first quarter. It sold just 413 of its cheaper ES6 model. “In an environment of softer macro-economic and auto market conditions, we continue to work hard to expand our market penetration,” Chief Executive Officer William Bin Li said in a statement. Nio expects deliveries in the third quarter to be between 4,200 and 4,400 units, 18.2% to 23.8% higher from the second quarter. Irwin said he continues to see China as one of the most important global EV markets and expects sales there to rebound in November and December. Apart from Tesla, Nio competes with a swathe of Chinese electric vehicle startups such as Byton and Xpeng Motors. While Tesla does not disclose sales by country, consultancy firm LMC Automotive estimates the company to have sold 23,678 vehicles in China in the first seven months this year, nearly double the number of cars it sold a year earlier. The starting price of its Model X sport utility vehicle (SUV) is 809,900 yuan in China and the long-range dual-motor variants of mass-market Model 3 cars is priced at 439,900 yuan. This compares with Nio’s 6-seater ES8’s price of 456,000 yuan and 358,000 yuan for the standard version of its ES6. The company’s shares touched a record low of $1.97 earlier in the session."

The end result? They decided not to invest in any. “There are too many uncertainties from when a company tells a story in the early stage, to when it produces a sample car and raises funds, to the eventual mass production,” said Wei, managing director at Shanghai-based Sailing Capital. Wei, who declined to name the EV makers his team visited, said he thinks only a few of them will survive. Sailing instead decided to invest in an EV parts supplier, he added. His concerns reflect what bankers describe as increasingly tough funding times for Chinese EV makers which must jostle for attention in a crowded sector and produce convincing arguments about future profitability despite government cuts to EV subsidies and plans to phase them out. Numerous setbacks plaguing Tesla Inc in its quest for sustained profitability as well as a dramatic slide in sales and problems with some cars at Chinese startup Nio Inc have also put investors on their guard. This year, Chinese EV makers have raised just $783.1 million as of mid-June compared with $6 billion for the same period a year earlier and $7.7 billion for all of 2018, according to data provider PitchBook. One Hong Kong-based banker said he had been approached by at least a dozen EV makers seeking new funds but had to pass on most of them as they were not able to set themselves apart from the crowd. Even fundraising efforts that have gotten off the ground are not moving as fast as EV makers would like. “It is challenging,” said the banker who began working on one fundraising this year. “If you can get a meeting with investors, you can always tell a story, but some don’t even reply to your requests for a meeting.” He declined to be identified as the negotiations were not public. Eager to curb smog and jump-start its own auto industry, China has said it wants so-called new energy vehicles (NEVs) - which also include hybrids, plug-in hybrids and fuel cell cars - to account for a fifth of auto sales by 2025 compared with 5% now. Those ambitions have spawned a plethora of EV startups competing not just with each other, but also global automakers and Tesla, which plans to start production in China this year. About 330 EV firms are registered for some sort of subsidy, government data shows, although the number of more well established startups is much smaller, at around 50. But amid criticism that some firms have become overly reliant on government funds, Beijing has reduced subsidies, raised the standards needed for vehicles to qualify and flagged they will end altogether after 2020. That has led to sharp slowdown as vehicle prices rise. Sales of NEVs in May rose just 1.8% from a year earlier compared with 18.1% in April, and 62% growth for 2018. Surviving in the current funding environment, requires much cost discipline, Daniel Kirchert, CEO at Nanjing-based EV maker Byton, told Reuters. “Given the current situation, it is not enough for any startup to come up with good products and be fast to market. At least it’s equally important to manage cost. Not only fixed costs but variable cost,” he said. Byton, which is backed by state-owned automaker FAW Group and battery supplier Contemporary Amperex Technology Co (CATL) is one of a few EV makers with a fundraising round in train, seeking $500 million. Others include Leap Motor, backed by state-owned Shanghai Electric Group Corp and Sequoia Capital China, which is seeking $372 million as well as CHJ Automotive, founded by serial entrepreneur Li Xiang, which wants to raise as much as $500 million. Those with successful funding under their belts this year include Baidu Inc-backed WM Motor Technology Co Ltd which closed a $446 million round in March, according to PitchBook. Some have obtained money outside private equity. E-Town Capital, a Beijing government investment firm, will invest 10 billion yuan ($1.4 billion) in a joint venture with Nio, which could help Nio build its own plant. But overall, industry funding prospects are much bleaker, particularly as Tesla and Nio struggle. Founder Elon Musk told Tesla employees last month the $2.7 billion the company recently raised would give it just 10 months to break even at the rate it burned cash in the first quarter. Shares in the industry pioneer have slid 32% in the year to date. Nio’s shares have been hit harder, down 60% this year on a cut to its delivery outlook, a halving in first-quarter sales from the previous quarter, increased competition and reduced subsidies. Its reputation has also been hurt after three vehicles caught on fire and by the inadvertent shutting down of a car on Beijing’s prestigious Changan Avenue after the driver initiated a software update. Nio declined to comment. “Some of the listed EV industry leaders are currently underperforming in the secondary trading market and that has created pressures for the sector’s short-term outlook,” said Brian Gu, president of EV startup Xpeng Motors and a former senior JP Morgan banker. “We are seeing investors become more cautious, selective and keenly focused on the frontrunners. I think this trend is likely to persist,” he said. An investor in WM Motor was more downbeat about the willingness of private equity investors to fund the industry. “Nio is probably the best among Chinese EV start-ups.

-6.22950819672131," EV maker Nio plans Beijing plant, will likely seek a partner: CEO BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese electric vehicle (EV) maker Nio Inc is keen to build a production base in Beijing and will likely seek a manufacturing partner, Chief Executive Officer and founder William Li said this week. His comments come after Nio said on Tuesday that it would form a joint venture with Beijing E-Town International Investment and Development Co Ltd, which will invest 10 billion yuan ($1.45 billion) in the new entity. Nio’s current manufacturing base in the eastern province of Anhui has an annual production capacity of 100,000 units, but this is insufficient, Li told a conference on Wednesday, according to a transcript provided by the company. The company, headquartered in Shanghai, operates the factory at Hefei with Anhui Jianghuai Automobile Group Co Ltd. Nio delivered 3,989 units in the first quarter, almost half of what it rolled out in the previous quarter. “We will evaluate all possibilities and will not completely rule out the plan to build the Beijing factory independently. The first choice is still manufacturing with a partner, which is our consistent strategic thinking,” Li said. China’s new energy vehicle market, the world’s largest, is booming, and many in the industry still believe that there is a big room for new EV makers. However, fierce competition, subsidy reduction and a slowing economy having raised concerns over their performance. Nio’s U.S.-listed shares hit a record low after BofA-ML downgraded the stock to “underperform”, citing weak orders for ES8 and ES6 models due to purchase subsidy cuts for EVs, reduced free cash flow, higher refinancing risks, increased competition from Tesla and rich valuation."

-50.0," Exclusive: Chinese EV car maker NIO restricts its IPO banks from working for rivals - sources HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese electric vehicle (EV) maker NIO Inc has blocked the eight top investment banks that did its IPO from working for rivals by tying them up in rare year-long non-compete clauses, several people with direct knowledge of the matter said. The move highlights the fierce competition between China’s EV makers as they seek the capital needed to survive in a fast-growing market, also the world’s largest. NIO, for its initial public offering in September, had hired Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Morgan Stanley and UBS. These were also the top eight banks worldwide for equity sales in 2018, according to Refinitiv data. The non-compete clause prevents them from helping NIO’s rivals raise public or private funds for 12 months following the IPO, the sources said, declining to be named as they were not authorized to speak publicly on the matter. NIO and the banks declined to comment. The list of rivals covered by the restrictions included up to 10 names, although it may have varied between the individual agreements, the people said. Xpeng Motors and WM Motor were on that list, three sources said. A separate source said the list included those two and Byton, among others. NIO’s non-compete demands were particularly restrictive both in their breadth and duration, several sources said. Typically such deals restrict banks from working with rivals until the transaction closes or for a shorter period such as six months, two of the sources said. “Issuers sometimes don’t like it when you’re doing an IPO for the competitors on a concurrent timetable because they will worry that you might divulge information to the benefit of the other clients,” said Stephen Chan, partner at law firm Dechert LLP, speaking about general industry practices. One banker involved in the NIO deal said his bank had lost mandates because of the non-compete clause. Adding to the banks’ frustration, they had signed up to NIO’s demands when the IPO was expected to raise about double the $1 billion it actually brought in - meaning banks would initially have expected a much larger payout. “It would have been interesting in hindsight seeing if it could have got the same agreement with people knowing what the actual valuation was going to be,” a senior banker who worked on the deal said. NIO’s move comes at a time when many Chinese EV makers are considering IPOs or have launched private fundraisings as China cuts the subsidies it has historically offered as part of its efforts to curb pollution. On Wednesday, China said it had raised its standards for NEVs that qualify for subsidies and reduced the amount it was willing to provide. In January, Byton was seeking to raise at least $500 million to finance its growth, people familiar with the matter told Reuters at the time. Earlier this month, WM Motor announced it closed its Series C funding round of 3 billion yuan ($446.16 million). Reuters reported on Friday that Leap Motor, a smaller EV maker, was seeking a private fundraising of 2.5 billion yuan, advised by Deutsche Bank. NIO itself did not stop with its IPO. In January, it sold a $750 million convertible bond to plug the gap between the money it raised in its IPO and what it had expected to raise."
-38.45177664974619," Chinese EV carmaker NIO raises $650 million via convertible bond HONG KONG (Reuters) - Electric carmaker NIO Inc, one of the main rivals to Tesla in China, raised $650 million in a five-year convertible bond on Thursday, aiming to use the proceeds to fund expansion. The Shanghai-based carmaker’s move to raise capital via an equity-linked bond - only four months after it listed in New York - mirrors that of China’s Netflix-like video platform iQiyi, which sold a $750 million convertible bond in November after going public last year, highlighting the growing appeal of convertibles for high-growth companies in need of cash. Convertible bonds are a cheaper funding avenue due to their lower coupons in exchange for giving the bondholder the option of converting the debt into company shares at a set price in future. The equity link gives investors fixed returns and the prospect of profiting from a rise in the issuer’s share price. NIO sold a five-year convertible bond with a conversion premium of 27.5 percent and a coupon of 4.5 percent, according to a press release from the company. The startup could raise as much as $750 million if a greenshoe, or over-allotment option, is exercised within 30 days. The company’s shares closed at $7.46 on Wednesday and were up about 24 percent since they started trading in September. Louis Hsieh, NIO’s chief financial officer, told investors on a call on Wednesday that part of the reason for selling a convertible bond was to make up the difference between what the company raised in its IPO and what it had originally sought to raise. NIO raised $1 billion in its U.S. IPO but it had earlier aimed for $1.8-$2 billion, Hsieh said. Asked about the timing, Hsieh said the convertible bond market was receptive to a deal and he did not want to wait until March or April and risk a possible worsening in U.S.-China trade tensions. Convertible bonds are booming in Asia, hitting their highest volumes last year since the financial crisis, with $35.5 billion raised, according to Refinitiv data. Their appeal is growing at a time when interest rates are rising, driving up borrowing costs when companies in Asia face almost $500 billion in maturing dollar-denominated bonds over the next two years. For tech companies or startups, which can have more volatile stock prices and are often unrated, convertible bonds also represent a cheaper funding alternative than straight debt. China is the world’s largest and fastest-growing market for new-energy vehicles (NEVs), a category comprising electric battery cars and plug-in electric hybrids, but competition is fierce as Beijing looks to rein in subsidies that led to a huge array of EV contenders entering the market. NIO’s revenue and deliveries of its electric SUV soared in the third quarter of last year. It plans to use the proceeds of the convertible bond for research and development, development of manufacturing facilities and sales and marketing.

-34.98659517426274," Chinese EV carmaker NIO aims to raise $650 mln with convertible bond HONG KONG, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Electric carmaker NIO Inc , among rivals to Tesla in China, launched a $650 million convertible bond on Wednesday, four months after it listed in New York. Its move to raise capital via an equity-linked bond mirrors that of China’s Netflix-like video platform iQiyi, which sold a $750 million convertible bond in November after going public last year, and highlights the growing appeal of convertibles for high-growth companies in need of cash. Convertible bonds are a cheaper funding avenue due to their lower coupons in exchange for giving the bondholder the option of converting the debt into company shares at a set price in future. The equity link gives investors fixed returns and the prospect of profiting from a rise in the issuer’s share price. NIO was marketing a five-year convertible bond with a conversion premium of between 27.5 percent and 32.5 percent, according to a term sheet seen by Reuters. The Shanghai-based EV startup could raise as much as $750 million if a greenshoe, or over-allotment option, was exercised. The company’s shares closed at $6.94 on Tuesday and were up about 16 percent since they started trading in September. Convertible bonds are booming in Asia, hitting their highest volumes last year since the financial crisis, with $35.5 billion raised, according to Refinitiv data. Their appeal is growing at a time when interest rates are rising, driving up borrowing costs when companies in Asia face almost $500 billion in maturing dollar-denominated bonds over the next two years. For tech companies or startups, which can have more volatile stock prices and are often unrated, convertible bonds also represent a cheaper funding alternative than straight debt. China is the world’s largest and fastest-growing market for new-energy vehicles (NEVs), a category comprising electric battery cars and plug-in electric hybrids, but competition is fierce as Beijing looks to rein in subsidies that led to a huge array of EV contenders entering the market. NIO’s revenue and deliveries of its electric SUV soared in the third quarter of last year. It plans to use the proceeds of the convertible bond for research and development, development of manufacturing facilities and sales and marketing.

24.124513618677046," Nio, China rival to Tesla, says U.S. head to step down SHANGHAI (Reuters) - The U.S. head of Nio Inc NIO.N, an electric carmaker seen as one of the main Chinese rivals to Tesla Inc TSLA.O, will leave the company, the firm said in a filing on Friday, the first major management departure since its September IPO. Padmasree Warrior, chief executive officer of NIO USA and global chief development officer, will resign from her posts on Dec. 17 for “personal interests”, the company said. Warrior joined Nio, previously called NextEV, in 2015, and led the company along with founder and CEO William Li to become one of China’s most legitimate challengers in the global race to develop electric vehicles. Before joining Nio, Warrior was chief technology and strategy officer at Cisco Systems Inc CSCO.O and chief technology officer at Motorola. China is the world’s largest and fast-growing market for new-energy vehicles (NEVs), a category comprising electric battery cars and plug-in electric hybrids. NEV sales in the first 10 months of 2018 came in at 860,000 vehicles, up 75.6 percent year-on-year. Competition is, however, rising as Beijing looks to rein in subsidies that led to a huge array of EV contenders entering the market. Some of those are now being weeded out. Tesla itself is building a car manufacturing plant in Shanghai to bolster its presence in the market and reduce its prices to become more competitive. Nio’s shares - up strongly this year on robust revenue growth and bullish views from some analysts - dropped more than 4 percent in U.S. trading on Thursday."
-12.787723785166241," Chinese electric carmaker NIO delivers 3,268 SUVs in third quarter (Reuters) - Chinese electric carmaker NIO Inc NIO.N said on Monday it delivered 3,268 electric SUVs in the third quarter, exceeding its own target of 2,900-3,000 vehicles. While the China national holiday and the planned maintenance will slow its deliveries for October, it remained on track to achieve delivery goal of 10,000 ES8s for the second half of 2018, NIO said. Delivery volume of the ES8, a 7-seater high-performance electric SUV, in September 2018 was 1,766 - a nearly 58 percent jump from the prior month, NIO said. The company has sold 3,350 ES8s since starting delivery on June 28. NIO said it targets to launch its 5-seater premium SUV ES6 in June/July 2019. NIO, formerly known as NextEV and backed by Chinese tech heavyweight Tencent Holdings Ltd 0700.HK, is one of several largely Chinese-funded EV startups betting on the benefits of local production to compete with firms such as Tesla Inc TSLA.O."
