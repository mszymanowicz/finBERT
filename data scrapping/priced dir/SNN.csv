It said the first-half decline at the consumer business came in at 10.9%, while the Tesa adhesives business, which supplies the automotive and electronics industries, saw a drop of 10%. Beiersdorf said in May that its La Prairie premium skincare brand and sun care products have been hit by the drop in international travel even though sales of hand wash, hand creams and plasters jumped."

The company’s share price rose by as much as 10%, leading gainers on Britain’s blue-chip FTSE 100 index on Thursday after it exceeded 2019 results expectations and estimated sales growth this year of 3.5% to 4.5%. Smith+Nephew, one of the main global players in orthopaedic implants and prosthetics as well as a raft of dressings and other complex technologies for surgeons, has seen newer markets including China emerge as growth drivers. Chief Executive Roland Diggelmann, who took over in November, told Reuters that Chinese sales grew by about 30% in 2019 and now represent 7% of total sales. China’s coronavirus outbreak has not disrupted Smith+Nephew’s operations in the country so far, Diggelmann said, but the company is monitoring the situation because the epidemic has affected the wider region. “We’re active mostly in elective surgery, and these elective surgeries are not the focus of healthcare authorities now. Rightfully, they’re really focused on containing the outbreak,” he said. The virus has killed more than 2,000 people in China and infected some 75,000 people, confining millions to their homes, disrupting supply chains and delaying reopening of factories after the extended Lunar New Year holiday break. Smith+Nephew said its 2020 outlook assumes the outbreak would cease to disrupt normal business activities early in the second quarter. JP Morgan analysts said that though growth this year is likely to be loaded in the second half, the outbreak is likely to remain a short-term overhang. Underlying sales growth in emerging markets was 16.1%, while the revenue posted by Smith+Nephew’s sports medicine & ENT unit increased 7%. Growing patient populations and improving medical expertise in newer markets are making up for slowing growth in mature markets for Smith+Nephew. Chief Financial Officer Graham Baker told Reuters the 4.4% underlying growth in revenue in 2019 was the company’s best since at least 2010. Analysts were expecting 2019 sales of $5.12 billion and underlying growth of 4.1%, a company-compiled consensus showed.

The company reported group organic sales growth slowed to 4.1% for all of 2019, from 4.3% for the first nine months, with annual sales coming in at 7.653 billion euros ($8.53 billion), roughly in line with analyst consensus. The consumer unit, which makes brands including Nivea, Eucerin and La Prairie, saw full-year sales growth of 4.8%, down from 5.1% in the first nine months. “Even though we expect headwinds in the 2020 financial year... we ... are looking forward to the fiscal year ahead with cautious optimism,” Chief Executive Stefan de Loecker said in a statement. Shares in Beiersdorf were knocked on Tuesday when Societe Generale cuts the stock to “sell” from “hold”, saying it sees a slowdown in the Nivea and La Prairie brands in the first half of 2020. Beiersdorf has been suffering as consumers have moved away from mass-market labels such as Nivea toward niche labels and products with more natural ingredients, prompting the company to set up an innovation unit to develop new “indie” brands. The Tesa business, which makes adhesives for the automotive and electronics industries and accounts for about 20% of sales, reported sales growth slowed again to 0.8% for the full year from 1.2% in the first nine months. Beiersdorf said the electronics business performed well but sales were weak in the automotive business due to an uncertain market environment."

13.356242725740508," Smith+Nephew CEO steps down over pay, ex-Roche Diagnostics chief to take over (Reuters) - Smith+Nephew Plc SN.L Chief Executive Namal Nawana is stepping down after just 17 months in the role after becoming dissatisfied with his salary at the medical device maker. The company said Nawana, who will be replaced by former Roche Diagnostics head Roland Diggelmann, was leaving to pursue opportunities outside the United Kingdom and his departure was a mutual decision. A spokeswoman gave no additional details. “There appears to be a pretty simple reason Nawana is leaving – pay,” AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said. “It became apparent over the summer that the company was looking for ways to increase its head honcho’s remuneration with apparent discussions about a move to a U.S. listing to escape an increasing backlash in the UK towards excessive executive pay.” An earlier FT report had said Smith+Nephew directors discussed moving the company’s main listing from London to New York, where higher executive payouts are more common and less controversial, to boost its top salaries. Analysts at Berenberg also said Nawana’s pay “aspirations” made his departure inevitable. Nawana, who steps down at the end of the month, did not respond to request for comment on LinkedIn. Faced with stricter rules in the United Kingdom designed to tackle soaring executive pay, the company is in talks with shareholders over its 2020 remuneration policy. Nawana, who joined the British maker of artificial knees and hips in May 2018, received total pay of $2.88 million that year, according to the company’s last annual report. His predecessor Olivier Bohuon received $5.12 million in 2017. Smith+Nephew shares, which have risen 40% since Nawana’s appointment last year, fell 8.2% on Monday. Nawana had focused on boosting revenue and profitability by realigning the 160-year-old company’s operations, concentrating on product divisions rather than geographies. He was former head of U.S. diagnostics company Alere - where he earned $8.6 mln in 2016 - and overhauled more than half of Smith+Nephew’s leadership team. He hired heads for the company’s main divisions of sports medicine, orthopaedics and wound management to speed up product development. Results came quickly as the company reported higher than expected half-year profit and boosted its 2019 revenue forecast in July. Analysts expect Smith+Nephew’s revenue to rise more than 4% this fiscal year, compared with the 0.8% to 3% growth the company has had over the last three years. Smith+Nephew is looking to Diggelmann, with more than 20 years in the orthopedics and diagnostics sectors, to continue revenue growth by building on Nawana’s strategy. He has already had a hand in many decisions having been a board member since March last year. “We expect (Diggelmann) to pursue a strategy of improving operational execution, something any competitor of Roche Diagnostics would say he did extremely well,” Berenberg analyst Tom Jones said. High executive pay has become a controversial issue in Britain, highlighted by outsized awards such as a $100 million pounds bonus to Jeff Fairburn, chief executive of housebuilder Persimmon PSN.L. The company said in November he would leave after deciding criticism of the award had become a distraction. Regulations introduced in January mean listed companies with over 250 employees will have to disclose the ratio of CEO pay to the rest of the company’s workforce, in a move the government said would make companies justify the pay of top bosses."
-6.791965939319478," Nivea-maker Beiersdorf launches brand for tattooed skin BERLIN (Reuters) - German consumer goods firm Beiersdorf BEIG.DE is launching its first new brand for more than 30 years - a line of body creams specially for tattooed skin - as it seeks to tap into the growing popularity of skin art and appeal to a younger audience. Beiersdorf said the “Skin Stories” line would go on sale at the end of September, including a repair balm for new tattoos, sun protection in a stick and a daily body lotion. The launch comes as mass-market labels like Nivea are losing ground to small, disruptive brands, especially among younger consumers, who favor more natural ingredients and new labels. Beiersdorf said almost one in five Germans now have a tattoo, with the proportion close to half among women aged between 25 and 34, and rising further. A moisturizer is recommended to take care of tattooed skin to keep the design from cracking and flaking. The brand is the brainchild of an innovation unit that Beiersdorf set up in July to develop “indie” brands and strengthen existing lines such as Labello, 8X4, and Hidrofugal. “Tattoos are becoming more and more popular ... They are now a personal accessory. But few people know how to look after tattoos properly,” Hauke Voss, director of the Indie Brands unit, said in a statement."

Beiersdorf said in a statement that Coppertone had sales of around $213 million in 2018. It said the transaction was subject to approval by merger control authorities, but should be closed in the third quarter. “We are convinced that Coppertone and its team will add complementary expertise to our leading brand portfolio and significantly strengthen our position particularly in the U.S.,” said Beiersdorf chief executive Stefan de Loecker. In the first quarter, Beiersdorf’s sales growth in North America lagged most of the rest of the group, rising 3.7 percent after stripping out currency effects, versus 6 percent overall. De Loecker, who took over as CEO in January, has said he wants to look for acquisitions. The company is sitting on a cash pile of more than 4 billion euros and has faced calls from investors to return cash to shareholders. Beiersdorf’s Nivea Sun is a leading sun care brand in Europe and its Eucerin brand also makes sun care products. Founded in 1944, Coppertone was bought by Bayer in 2014. The chemicals firm said it had made progress in revitalizing the brand and developing more innovative products. Bayer said the sale would allow it to focus on building its core over-the-counter brands like Asprin and Berocca vitamins."
12.734920639086136," UPDATE 2-Smith & Nephew lifts revenue view after best quarter since 2015 * Q1 underlying revenue growth of 4.4 percent * FY growth seen in upper half of earlier forecast * Emerging markets will continue to be tailwind - CEO * Shares rise 3.5 percent (Rewrites, adds CEO comment; updates shares) May 2 (Reuters) - Smith & Nephew nudged up its annual revenue growth forecast on Thursday after the medical products maker reported its best quarter in more than three years on increased demand from newer markets, sending its shares up 3.5 percent. Emerging markets, especially China, have been a bright spot for the company as its mature markets, including the United States which accounts for about half of its revenue, stabilise after a shaky start to last year. The company, which makes hip and knee implants as well as wound care products, reported underlying sales growth of 4.4 percent in the quarter ended March 30, the highest since at least the fourth quarter of 2015. Growth of 15.3 percent in emerging markets powered Smith & Nephew's total revenue to $1.20 billion, in line with analysts' expectations, according to a company-compiled consensus here. Demand from emerging markets will continue to lift the company as patient populations grow and medical expertise improves, Chief Executive Officer Namal Nawana told Reuters. “As clinicians (in emerging markets) get trained to do more sophisticated procedures like joint replacement or sports medicine procedures ... we see these as great tailwinds.” The strong first-quarter showing encouraged the company to lift its 2019 underlying growth expectation to the upper half of its previous 2.5-3.5 percent forecast range. FTSE-100 member Smith & Nephew also benefited from 5.3 percent growth in its sports medicines unit. Under Nawana’s stewardship, Smith & Nephew - no stranger to M&A talks - has been pushing to grow through deals. The CEO was appointed in April last year in part for his deal-making expertise and knowledge of the U.S. market. In March, Smith & Nephew bought U.S.-based regenerative medicine maker Osiris Therapeutics for $660 million.

14.955195483851004," Nivea revamp boosts Beiersdorf's sales BERLIN (Reuters) - German consumer goods firm Beiersdorf reported a recovery in sales of its Nivea skin cream and its premium La Prairie brand in the first quarter after a new chief executive pledged more investment to fight niche brands. Beiersdorf shares rose more than 3 percent after the group said on Tuesday that first-quarter sales came in at 1.947 billion euros ($2.2 billion), a rise of 6 percent after stripping out currency effects and acquisitions. That was ahead of average analyst forecasts for 1.9 billion euros. Mass-market labels like Nivea have struggled in recent years amid the rise of small, disruptive brands like Canada’s The Ordinary, and as consumers favored more natural ingredients and premium products. That has prompted Beiersdorf to push pricier brands like La Prairie and Eucerin, and to launch more expensive products under the Nivea label, like its anti-ageing Cellular range. Shares in Beiersdorf were hit in February after new Chief Executive Stefan De Loecker warned that the group’s operating margin would fall in 2019 as it invests to respond to smaller disruptive brands. On Tuesday, De Loecker said Beiersdorf’s drive to become more nimble was already paying off. “Recognizing local consumer and market trends and responding to them on an individual basis helped us boost sales in all regions,” he said in a statement. Beiersdorf shares were up 3.4 percent at 0807 GMT, the top gainer in Germany’s Dax blue-chip index. “This... is a notably strong result in absolute terms for a mass market player. Guidance is being maintained but we see room for upgrades on both the top and bottom line,” said Jefferies analyst Martin Deboo. The consumer business saw growth jump 6.8 percent in January-March, well ahead of average analyst forecasts for 3.9 percent. Nivea sales rose 4.9 percent, compared with 2.8 percent in 2018, and La Prairie skin care brand accelerated again to 28.7 percent. French rival L’Oreal reported a similar trend earlier this month, with first-quarter sales in its mass market division up 3.3 percent, while its luxury brand grew 14 percent. Beiersdorf’s finance chief Dessi Temperley said Nivea’s recovery had been broad based across several regions, with the launch of premium “Cellular Elasticity” products going well in Europe, while La Prairie had been helped by travel retail, particularly in Asia. De Loecker said the launch in Thailand of a new Eucerin anti-pigment serum, which aims to reduce dark spots on skin, had gone better than expected, with plans to roll it out to other countries in Asia this year. Beiersdorf’s Tesa unit, which makes adhesives for the automotive and electronics industries and was the group’s main growth driver in 2018, saw first-quarter sales expand just 2.2 percent, shy of average analyst forecasts for 2.3 percent. Beiersdorf said Tesa sales in the automotive sector fell, hitting its business in the Americas, while sales in Asia were supported by growth in the electronics business. Beiersdorf confirmed its guidance for 2019 despite ongoing economic risks. It expects group sales growth of 3-5 percent, and an operating margin of 14 to 14.5 percent in its core consumer business unit."

The deal will help Smith & Nephew better compete with bigger rivals such as U.S.-based Johnson & Johnson as Osiris’s products, including skin and bone grafts, complements its portfolio of wound care products. “Greater presence in the fast growing regenerative medicine market enhances our portfolio and will help immediately accelerate our wound management business,” Smith & Nephew Chief Executive Officer Namal Nawana said. Smith and Nephew will pay Osiris shareholders $19 in cash for each share they hold. Osiris shares closed at $18.88 on the Nasdaq on Monday. Osiris brought in revenue of $102 million for the nine-months ended Sept.30, 2018, an 18.7 percent rise over the same period in 2017.

Smith & Nephew, no stranger to M&A talks, had highlighted its push to expand its offerings through deals during an earnings call in February."

The company has been under pressure to improve margins and find new sources of growth as it competes with bigger rivals such as Stryker Corp, Zimmer Biomet Holdings and Johnson & Johnson. The medical technology firm, which rearranged its commercial network in November to boost sales, forecast 2019 profit margins between 22.8 percent and 23.2 percent and revenue growth between 2.5 percent and 3.5 percent, largely in line with estimates. Smith & Nephew’s established markets, including the United States from where the company gets about half of its revenue from, had returned to growth following a tough start to 2018, but have now slowed as the market saturates. Emerging markets, especially China, however, are growing. Revenue edged up 1.3 percent to $1.29 billion from a year earlier, just short of average analyst forecast of $1.30 billion, according to a company-provided consensus, as growth in established markets slowed and it was hurt by a stronger dollar. Smith & Nephew’s operating profit for fiscal 2018 fell 7.6 percent to $863 million from a year earlier. Its adjusted earnings of 100.9 cents per share beat expectations of 95 cents.

Shares in the artificial hips and knees maker jumped 5.2 percent to 1,340 pence in early trading on Thursday after the positive update. “Underlying growth was solid, and there was a welcome return to good growth in the hips business,” Bernstein analysts said. The company forecast that for 2018 its underlying revenue would be in the lower half of the 2 percent to 3 percent range, but said that 2018’s trading profit margin would benefit from improved cost controls and a favourable legal settlement. To help secure future growth, Smith & Nephew also said it would rearrange its commercial framework, appointing presidents of three franchises to help add new sales. Smith & Nephew posted third-quarter revenue of $1.17 billion, up 3 percent on the same period last year on an underlying basis, boosted by strong demand in the United States and emerging markets.

Despite a firmer start to trading and a weaker pound, the blue chip FTSE 100 turned lower and ended the session down 0.54 percent at 7,502.69 points, only slightly outperforming a negative European market. Results dominated trading with sharp falls for some stocks, but investors remained positive on the overall picture for the UK earnings season. Shares in Smith & Nephew had their worst performance in close to 10 years, down 7 percent after Europe’s biggest artificial hip and knee maker downgraded its revenue and profit forecasts following a weak first quarter. Go Ahead Group tumbled 11.2 percent after Deutsche Bank downgraded the stock to ‘hold’ from ‘buy’, saying that in the absence of future rail franchise wins it is no longer clear the shares are significantly undervalued. Glencore shares climbed 0.4 percent after the commodities trader and miner said it expected 2018 earnings from its trading division to be at the top end of its previously forecast range. Despite the negative mood on the day, Britain’s leading stock index has enjoyed a rapid revival in recent weeks. It is up a hefty 9 percent since it hit a 15-month low as recently as March 26. “I would not be surprised if we continue to see very strong UK equities numbers and a really quite material re-rating,” said Guy Monson, chief investment officer at Sarasin & Partners, adding that if Brexit talks result in a settlement there could be a flight back into UK equities. “We have been tactically adding on dark days,” he added, saying he was keeping a UK focus “for a real backing of the underdog.” Inbound M&A interest in British assets continued apace with French property group Fonciere des Regions buying 14 upmarket hotels in Britain from Starwood Capital for 858 million pounds ($1.2 billion). The deal would also see InterContinental Hotels Group sign long-term leases for 13 of those 14 hotels and subsequently rebranding and running them. “We have seen absolutely record levels of M&A,” said Sarasin’s Monson. “The deal market began the year dotted with a few intra-UK announcements, but has since seen a flurry of large inbound acquisition attempts,” said Liberum strategists. “These stocks have offered growing revenue and international exposure at a depressed valuation.”"

Shares in the British company fell 7 percent after it said underlying revenue for the year would rise by 2-3 percent, less than the 3-4 percent predicted in February. It also lowered trading profit forecasts, predicting a margin at or above the level achieved last year rather than the 30-70 basis point growth it had targeted. Bohuon, who steps down on Monday, said the business had seen a “mixed performance” in the quarter to end-March, with established markets like the United States and Europe down 2 percent on an underlying basis and emerging markets up 9 percent, resulting in a flat result overall. He said the disappointing performance was mainly because of market weakness, citing changing insurance patterns in the United States and budget constraints in Europe hitting elective surgery volumes in Europe. Britain’s state-run health service cancelled some operations at the start of the year because of a shortage of capacity for example. Bohuon said trading had picked up since the quarter end. “I see an improving trend; April is showing much better trading and coming back to normal levels, much better than we have seen in January, February and March,” he told reporters. Other areas of weakness included its advanced wound bioactives business, which focuses on difficult-to-treat wounds, where revenue was down 12 percent. Analyst Kit Lee at Jefferies, who has a “buy” rating on the company, said the divisional trends were familiar but there were more negative than positives in the update. Bohuon will be replaced by Namal Nawana, who most recently headed medical diagnostics firm Alere, where he oversaw its $5.3 billion sale to Abbott in 2017. The medical technology firm, which also has wound-care and sports medicine units, is under pressure to improve margins and find new sources of growth as it competes with bigger rivals. It is a constant presence on analysts’ lists of potential takeovers, with speculation that it could be acquired by a U.S. competitor such as Stryker or be broken up The company reported first-quarter revenue of $1.2 billion, up 5 percent on a reported basis thanks to foreign exchange tailwinds of 5 percent.
