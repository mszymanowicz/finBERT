33.78921090528538," Alaska Airlines leases 13 Boeing 737 MAX jets after ungrounding (Reuters) - Alaska Air Group Inc said on Monday it would lease 13 new Boeing 737 MAX 9 planes from aircraft lessor Air Lease Corp, handing its traditional jet supplier a boost less than a week after Boeing won U.S. approval to fly the MAX again. Alaska also disclosed plans to sell 10 Airbus A320s to Air Lease, reducing its reliance on European jets inherited from a takeover of Virgin America and moving back towards being a carrier that labeled its jets ""Proudly All Boeing"". (prn.to/3m3XYxS) The deal is seen as Boeing’s opening shot together with an influential lessor in a campaign to rehabilitate the 737 MAX, which was grounded for 20 months following two fatal accidents. The U.S. planemaker is trying to secure eye-catching deals with other major carriers to sell the 737 MAX at heavily discounted prices to help rebuild what was once its fastest-selling product, industry sources said. Boeing has identified Alaska Air as one of the candidates to buy the 737 MAX jet along with Southwest Airlines, Delta Air Lines and Ryanair, the sources said. In an interview with the Financial Times on Sunday, Delta Air Lines’ Chief Executive Officer Ed Bastian hinted at the possibility of purchasing 737 MAX planes. Delta currently does not have the aircraft in its fleet. Alaska Air, which is based in Boeing’s main commercial factory city of Seattle, said it expects deliveries of the 13 737 MAX jets to start from the fourth quarter of 2021 and continue through 2022. The company’s 13 leased 737 MAX aircraft will be in addition to the 32 737 MAX jets it currently has on order with Boeing, Alaska Air said, adding that it expects to be flying five 737 MAX planes by summer of 2021. Reuters in October reported that Boeing was in discussions to sell 737 MAX jets to Alaska Air. (reut.rs/3pSKcAg)"

31.96996810846574," EXCLUSIVE-Boeing in talks with Alaska Air for potential 737 MAX order after jet's return to service -sources (New throughout, adds details on deal, Boeing and Alaska Air decline comment) SEATTLE/CHICAGO, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Boeing Co is in discussions to sell 737 MAX jets to Alaska Air Group Inc once the plane returns to service following a lengthy grounding, three people familiar with the matter said. The talks are part of a series of negotiations between Boeing and several airlines over jet orders or compensation after the 737 MAX was banned worldwide following two fatal crashes. Boeing and Alaska Air declined to comment. Any deal would be subject to U.S. Federal Aviation Administration approval of proposed 737 MAX safety upgrades. Alaska Air already had ordered 37 of the jets before the grounding. If confirmed, a new order from such a major carrier would give Boeing’s 737 MAX a sorely needed commercial boost as the U.S. planemaker tries to move beyond a crisis that has hammered its finances. It would also mark a post-crisis test of the balance of power between Boeing and Airbus. The European planemaker is battling to keep a foothold in Alaska Air. That carrier once exclusively used Boeing jets, until it acquired Airbus operator Virgin America. However, any new deal between Alaska Air and Boeing is expected to include significant discounts given the MAX’s woes and plunging demand for airplanes during the coronavirus crisis, industry sources said. The talks are among several discussions Boeing is having with airlines, hoping to stimulate demand for the jet when it returns to the air. Analysts caution cutting prices too far could rattle some existing customers. (Reporting by Eric M. Johnson in Seattle and Tracy Rucinski in Chicago Editing by Chris Reese and David Gregorio)"

11.774990214142411," U.S. airlines back up after second system glitch in a week (Reuters) - Major U.S. airlines were back up and running on Monday after a system-wide outage delayed hundreds of flights and fired-up customer complaints on social media, the second such disruption in a week. The Federal Aviation Administration said the root of the problem was caused by the program provided by Scottsdale, Arizona-based AeroData Inc that helps airlines measure and manage weight and balance. The agency released a statement around 8.30 a.m. ET, saying the issue had been resolved and an FAA spokesman said it plans to look into the outage. American Airlines, Southwest Airlines and Delta Air Lines had reported outages. United Airlines said it was unable to create paperwork for some time. “A brief third-party technology issue that prevented some Delta Connection flights from being dispatched on time this morning has been resolved,” Delta said. Other airlines also reported a series of delays. Southwest Airlines was the first carrier to report that the problem had been resolved and it would get travelers moving soon, but added that customers could expect flight delays. A Southwest spokesman could not confirm how many flights were delayed, but said it was safe to say hundreds. FlightAware, an airline tracking website, said Southwest had delayed 775 flights, or 18 percent of its U.S. flights on Monday. American Airlines, JetBlue Airways Corp, United Airlines and other carriers later said the technical issue had been resolved. JetBlue added it was still dealing with residual delays, while United said about 150 flights were delayed. Last week, several airlines had reported issues with Sabre Corp’s flight reservation and booking system due to which passengers had difficulty accessing flight check-in systems. Just a few minutes of system downtime in AeroData can result in over 100 delayed flights and loss of revenue, according to a 2017 case study by VMware Inc. AeroData could not be immediately reached for comment. Customers barraged Twitter with their complaints over confusion at airports and delayed flights. One Southwest passenger reported waiting on the tarmac in a plane in Dallas for 90 minutes after his 6 a.m. flight to New Orleans was delayed. The airline said after the systems resumed that the flight would arrive at 8.05 a.m. ""@SouthwestAir, I get the glitch, but if you could update your flight status times to current status that would help confused travelers from running frantic to catch a flight when the plane is not even waiting at the gate yet. Flight 929 not 8:50 but 'around' 10 am,"" a passenger tweeted. bit.ly/2I4UPfV ""My number one traveling pet peeve? Not updating a flight as delayed when you know the prior flight is delayed. How hard is this to get right @AmericanAir?"" said another frustrated passenger. bit.ly/2TOErlM Other passengers reported long wait times at airports and missed connections."
