-0.6403388345402412," Centrica to sell North American energy business for $3.63 billion LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Centrica Plc CNA.L on Friday said it was selling its North American subsidiary Direct Energy for $3.63 billion to U.S. integrated power firm NRG Energy NRG.N, clearing the way for the new head of the British Gas owner to focus on its home markets. The transaction was announced along with Centrica’s half-year earnings, where the group reported a profit slump due to the COVID-19 impact and low commodity prices. Both sets of shareholders welcomed the deal. Centrica’s shares ended 16.7% higher, having surged almost 40% early on Friday, and NRG closed up 2.9%. Centrica plans to use the cash from the sale to reduce net debt and contribute to its pension schemes, with its operations subsequently centred on the U.K. and Ireland. “We had a number of expressions of interest in Direct Energy but it came down to the right price and the right buyer,” Centrica Group Chief Executive Chris O’Shea told reporters on a conference call. O’Shea took over permanently as CEO in April. The transaction comes at a time of flux for power providers on both sides of the Atlantic, as companies shape their businesses to best cope with changed energy demands amid the coronavirus pandemic, such as greater working from home. For NRG, the transaction doubles the number of retail customers it serves to 6 million people, and strengthens its operations in the eastern United States, Chief Executive Mauricio Gutierrez told Reuters in an interview. “It’s really exciting for NRG as we have national reach,” said Gutierrez. Until now, NRG’s business was primarily focused on Texas. The sale of Direct Energy is part of a wider restructuring effort at Centrica which has gained additional significance amid the challenges of the pandemic. Last month, Centrica said it planned to cut around 5,000 jobs, almost 20% of its global workforce. The group reported a 14% drop in half-year operating profit to 343 million pounds ($436.3 million) from 399 million a year earlier. This was due to the pandemic which reduced energy use and weakened commodity prices. The net impact on pre-tax profit from the pandemic was around 60 million pounds as the company took mitigating measures such as not paying senior management bonuses, cost savings and using government job retention schemes. Centrica gave no full-year financial guidance due to the possibility of customers delaying or deferring payments because of an uncertain economic outlook and its implications for unemployment. It did not declare an interim dividend. Centrica said it remains committed to exiting exit oil and gas production and nuclear power generation but has paused planned divestment of its 20% stake in Britain’s nuclear energy fleet and the planned sale of its 69% shareholding in North Sea oil and gas producer Spirit Energy. It plans to restart the Spirit Energy process when commodity and financial markets have settled and is considering options for the sale of its nuclear stake."

Centrica, Britain’s largest energy supplier, said it would focus on its core home markets, the UK and Ireland, following the sale which its board believes is in the best interests of the company and its shareholders.

0.9543545989625248," Penn. federal judge denies bid to toss power plant river temperature lawsuit A federal judge in Pittsburgh on Wednesday rejected an NRG Energy Inc subsidiary’s claim to toss a lawsuit accusing it of illegally discharging overheated wastewater into the Allegheny River. The Springdale, Pennsylvania power plant said it abided by its permit, with no evidence pointing to its responsibility in a rise in river temperature. U.S. District Court Judge William Stickman denied the company’s motion for judgment on the pleadings, saying that “material facts” were required to determine whether power generator GenOn Power Midwest LP had, with the water discharges from its Cheswick Generating Station, violated its pollution permit by allegedly increasing the Allegheny’s temperatures in excess of limits set to protect aquatic life.

Russian tycoon Deripaska has agreed to reduce his stake in London-listed En+ to 44.95 percent from 70 percent and assign any voting rights above 35 percent to a voting trust formed by U.S. independent trustees D. J. Baker, David Crane, Arthur Dodge and Jersey-based Ogier Global Nominee Limited. VTB Bank, Russia’s second-largest lender, lifted its stake in EN+ to 22.27 percent from 7.65 percent, as part of the deal, but will now have votes representing 6.25 percent that will be controlled by Crane."
3.1638278391020647," NRG sheds U.S. power plants to focus on retail customers (Reuters) - U.S. power company NRG Energy Inc NRG.N wants to boost the size of its retail business as it sheds more than half of its power plants, Chief Executive Mauricio Gutierrez told Reuters. “NRG started as a generation company that moved into retail and some people still think of NRG in terms of (power plants),” Gutierrez said. “But when you think about NRG in the future, I invite you to think about the company in terms of the number of customers we serve,” he said. NRG serves around three million homes and businesses. In the past, NRG racked up billions of dollars of debt by diving into the renewable energy business at the same time U.S. power prices sank as cheap and abundant natural gas from shale formations flooded the market. Concern about those debts, among other things, led NRG to replace its former CEO David Crane in 2015 and to ultimately agree to sell most of its renewable portfolio, held by its stake in NRG Yield Inc NYLDa.N, to Global Infrastructure Partners in February. That deal, along with the sale of some coal and gas plants in Louisiana and Texas and other assets will provide the company with about $3 billion in proceeds and remove around $7 billion in debt, NRG said. In addition to the asset sales, NRG’s GenOn unit is working through bankruptcy proceedings that will see the unit separated from NRG, taking with it much of the company’s coal-fired plants. Gutierrez said he expects the sale of NRG Yield and separation of GenOn to occur in the fourth quarter. Those transactions will cut NRG’s generation portfolio from over 50,000 megawatts in 2015, before Gutierrez started transforming the company, to around 24,000 MW. One megawatt can power about 1,000 homes. “When I became CEO, it was clear we were trying to be too many things to too many people,” Gutierrez said in a letter to shareholders on Wednesday. He wants to grow the retail business, especially in the Northeast where NRG still has more generation than it needs to serve customers. Gutierrez said he wants to increase the size of the retail business through organic growth, but will consider acquisitions if the right opportunity presents itself, like its purchase of retail provider Xoom Energy earlier this year. “Our retail business is going to inform the size of our generation business,” Gutierrez said. NRG shares are up about 18 percent so far this year, after surging 132 percent last year."
