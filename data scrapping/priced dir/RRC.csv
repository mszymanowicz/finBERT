-1.735647530040052," PTT signs ethane supply deal with Range for Ohio petrochemical plant Sept 23 (Reuters) - State-owned Thai oil and gas company PTT PCL said on Wednesday its U.S. unit took a step forward on its proposed chemical plant in Ohio that will turn ethane into plastics with an ethane supply agreement with Range Resources Corp. Under the agreement, U.S. oil and gas producer Range will provide 15,000 barrels per day (bpd) of ethane as feedstock for PTT Global Chemical America’s (PTTGCA) planned ethane cracker along the Ohio River in Belmont County. PTTGCA said it will use the ethane to manufacture polyethylene, one of the key resins used to produce plastics products. PTTGCA said the agreement with Range is predicated on its reaching a final investment decision to build the facility. In June, PTTGCA said it delayed making a final investment decision to build the ethane cracker, which analysts estimate will cost $5.7 billion, from the first half of 2020 to the first half of 2021 due to the coronavirus. The company has said that if it were not for the coronavirus, the plant would likely already be under construction. The ethane cracker is designed to produce about 1.5 million metric tons of ethylene per year and will take 4-6 years to build. In addition, to PTTGCA’s project, Royal Dutch Shell PLC is building an ethane cracker nearby in western Pennsylvania."

-18.201754385964904," Range Resources expects to book asset impairment charge in fourth quarter (Reuters) - Range Resources Corp RRC.N said on Wednesday it expects a significant charge in the fourth quarter related to its oil and gas properties in north Louisiana, as U.S. natural gas prices trade near two-decade lows. The company’s shares were down 4.7% at $4.50 at midday. The announcement comes nearly a month after the No. 2 U.S. oil producer Chevron Corp CVX.N said it expects a writedown of $10 billion to $11 billion in the fourth quarter related to a deepwater Gulf of Mexico project and shale gas in Appalachia. Range Resources, like other producers, is pressured by a glut of shale gas coming from fields in Texas, Oklahoma and Pennsylvania. A long, steady increase in U.S. shale gas production – much of it a byproduct of the shale oil boom – has hit prices for the fuel. Oil producers are selling shale gas at low prices to get more lucrative oil to market. U.S. natural gas futures are trading at about $2.13 per million British Thermal Units (mmBTU), and energy consultancy IHS Markit forecasts the price could average below $2/mmBTU this year. Range Resources has significant holdings in the Marcellus shale gas field in the eastern United States, where pipeline constraints have worsened local pricing. Shale producers have also been pushed by investors to cut back spending and focus on higher returns and debt reduction instead as oil and gas prices continue to be volatile amid global uncertainties. On Monday, Range Resources said it would cut its capital expenditure by around 29% to about $520 million this year, and suspended its dividend. However, the company said on Wednesday it does not expect to record any impairments related to properties in the Appalachian basin."
-34.75336322869955," Range Resources suspends dividend, cuts 2020 capital expenditure (Reuters) - Range Resources Corp RRC.N said on Monday it will suspend its dividend and cut capital expenditure for the year, as the natural gas producer focuses on reducing debt. The company, which had declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.02 per share in December, said its dividend commitments were about $20 million annually. Shale producers have been reining in their spending, aiming to meet investor demands for higher returns and debt reduction. The Texas-based company had total debt of $3.16 billion as of Sept. 30, 2019, according to its latest quarterly filing. Range Resources also said it plans to lower its capital spending to about $520 million for 2020. The company now expects 2019 capex to be $728 million, about $28 million less than the original budget. The company said it would maintain 2020 production at about 2.3 billion cubic feet equivalent (Bcfe) per day. Range expects fourth-quarter production for 2019 at the high end of its prior outlook of between 2.33 Bcfe and 2.35 Bcfe per day."
