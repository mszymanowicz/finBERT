4.191191330558237," Autoliv posts quarterly profit beat as sales recover from pandemic blow STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden's Autoliv ALIVsdb.STALV.N, the world's largest producer of airbags and seatbelts, reported higher than expected quarterly earnings on Friday as it returned to profit in the wake of a coronavirus-linked plunge in car production. The rival of ZF TRW and Joyson Safety Systems also said it expected to further outperform global light vehicle production during a “very busy” fourth quarter for order intake, sending its Swedish-listed shares up 3.5% by 1100 GMT. “The worst demand decline on record in the second quarter was followed by a faster than expected recovery in the third quarter, with its challenges of managing the supply chain,” CEO Mikael Bratt said in a statement. Autoliv reported third-quarter operating profit of $175 million compared with $154 million in the year-ago quarter and a mean forecast of $163 million, based on a poll of analysts published by the company. The firm slammed the brakes on spending and moved to bolster its cash position as the pandemic and lockdowns saw auto production shuttered across much of Europe and North America, but it still slumped to a loss in the second quarter. Since then, production and demand have staged a recovery, though worries have grown amid a renewed and vigorous spread of the disease in large swathes of Europe and the United States. Bratt said the company was keeping a high level of flexibility. “We’ve had a quarter characterised by a strong recovery and heading into the fourth quarter, we see a continued trend along those lines in these first few weeks,” he told Reuters. “I would say that we are cautiously optimistic, but well aware of a lingering high level of uncertainty, and we are ready to make any changes we may need to do.” In its first stab at full-year guidance since the initial peak of the pandemic, it said it expected a 13% decline in like-for-like sales and an adjusted operating margin of 6%, down from 9.1% in 2019."

The company, which moved quickly to slash spending and boost its cash position as auto production in Europe and North America ground to a halt early in the second quarter, said it would continue to cut costs to adapt to the situation. But the company, which competes with ZF TRW as well as Joyson Safety Systems, also said it had seen a recovery taking hold from the middle of the quarter. “We must balance the cost reduction responses against the need for capacity to manage the recovery that started mid-quarter and continues in the first weeks of July,” CEO Mikael Bratt said in a statement. “I am also pleased that order intake for the first half year was in line with last year,” he added. The group still reported a second-quarter operating loss of $234 million compared with a $170 million profit in the year-ago quarter, well below of a mean forecast for a $133 million loss based on a poll of analysts published by the company. Autoliv, whose Swedish-listed shares eased 2.2% at 1043 GMT, said its adjusted operating loss was $171 million in the quarter."

The car industry has been thrown into a deep crisis as widespread lockdowns in many key markets due to the coronavirus hammered demand and production. Autoliv said that though car production had recently started to resume across North America and Europe, a positive development, the industry was still facing significant hurdles, with supply chain issues remaining an area of concern. “The ramp-up has started on a very low level and is characterized by strong fluctuations in customer demand,” the Swedish company said. Shares in Autoliv fell 5% by 0800 GMT and Handelsbanken Capital Markets said in a research note that there was a downside risk to estimates. Autoliv said its sales in Europe fell 89% in April from a year earlier and plunged 96% in the Americas region as factories were shut. In China, sales rose 3%. “With our largest markets Americas and Europe virtually standing still in April, the challenges we are managing in the second quarter are unprecedented,” Autoliv CEO Mikael Bratt said in a statement. The company’s share price has now lost 25% this year. Autoliv said it had cut its workforce “meaningfully” in April and expected further cuts in May and June, without giving details. As of March 31, its total headcount had decreased by 1,400 from a year earlier to about 65,000, according to the company’s first quarter report. Total headcount includes both permanent staff and temporary employees. Autoliv noted that data firm IHS forecasts a near 50% decline in global light vehicle production in the second quarter from a year earlier. The company said it had continued to slash costs to weather the crisis and had moved to further strengthen its liquidity by securing a lending facility of around 6 billion crowns ($632 million) with the Swedish Export Credit Corporation."

12.740737448559672," Sweden's Autoliv profit beat lifts shares amid Chinese recovery STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Autoliv ALV.N, the world's largest producer of airbags and seatbelts, reported a much smaller than expected fall in the quarterly earnings on Friday and said it had seen a recovery in demand and output in China as pandemic restrictions eased. First-quarter adjusted operating earnings at Autoliv fell to $134 million from a year-ago $173 million, but beat a consensus estimate of $72 million by analysts published by the company. Sales fell 15%. Autoliv, a supplier to most global car brands, saw its Stockholm-listed stock ALIVsdb.ST surge 7.9% by 1234 GMT, trimming losses in the year to date to 23%. The company, which competes with ZF TRW as well as Joyson Safety Systems, quickly moved to cut costs as the lockdowns to slow the pandemic saw carmakers across the world at varying times shutting down production over the past three months. Autoliv withdrew its guidance for the year in early April and said most of its plants were shut down at the time as measures to contain the new coronavirus spread, disrupting demand and supply chains. Since then the toughest lockdown measures have been largely lifted in China, with work resuming at factories across the country while hard-hit local car sales earlier this month recorded their first weekly rise since the virus outbreak. “We have seen significant recovery in demand and production in China since restarting in mid-February and all of our plants in China are now operating at normal levels,” Chief Executive Mikael Bratt said in a statement. Bratt said the overall situation was still more challenging now than in the first quarter due to greater customer closures outside China, though some European countries had taken small steps toward loosening curbs and restarting badly stalled economies over the past week. “It’s very hard to have a good picture of how rapidly this will happen as it will really depend on what country and even individual site you’re looking at,” he told Reuters. “As far as our ability to meet customers’ demands is concerned I don’t see any great challenges. We are well prepared.”"

The pandemic has forced shutdowns at car makers across the world and Autoliv only two weeks ago announced a raft of cost cuts to cushion the blow from the disruption. “Today we announce a number of additional actions taken by the company to continue to manage the effects brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic,” CEO Mikael Bratt said in a statement. “We will continue to evaluate the changing environment and are prepared to do what is necessary to get us through this humanitarian and economic crisis,” he added. Autoliv said it believed its position was robust in terms of both capital and liquidity. “But cancelling the dividend is in the best interests of the company to preserve cash and maintain flexibility given the highly uncertain environment,” it said. The company, which announced on March 19 it had tapped $500 million from its credit facility, said the additional $600 million would put its cash balance at around $1.4 billion. “The company believes a strong cash position will maximize our ability to navigate the challenging market,” it said. Autoliv said almost all of its plants in Europe, the Americas, India, Malaysia and the Philippines, were currently closed, with most closures at customers currently planned at between two weeks and one month. In China, operations had gradually recovered to around 90% compared to the same time in 2019, it added."

The company, the world’s biggest maker of airbags, said it needed to take measures due to the large number of plant closures at clients in recent days and expected ahead, and said it estimated that 63 customer plants in Europe would close or had already closed. “In light of these events, we are taking cost reduction actions to mitigate the impacts,” the company said in a statement. “Autoliv will adjust its production in accordance with the development of the demand situation, and it cannot be excluded that temporary Autoliv plant closures may become necessary.” The company also said it had decided to tap $500 million of its existing committed $1.1 billion revolving credit facility, saying it intended to use $300 million of the draw down to pay existing short-term debt maturities for the next three months.

While the car industry spent 2019 in a deep slump, hit by soft demand and mounting investment in electric and self-driving technology, Autoliv managed to keep growing on the back of years of order wins in the wake of the collapse of its former rival Takata, now a part of Joyson. The slump still saw Autoliv cut financial guidance repeatedly and embark on a plan to trim annual costs, axing hundreds of jobs in production as well as in areas such as sales and R&D. The automotive supplier, whose stock is listed in both the United States and Sweden, said it expected organic sales - excluding acquisitions, divestments and currency moves - to grow 3-4% this year versus 1.2% in 2019, with its adjusted operating margin reaching at least 9.5%, up from 9.1% last year. Refinitiv estimates showed analysts on average forecasting a 10% margin for 2020. Autoliv last year set a target of lifting its margin to 12% and to outgrow global light vehicle output by 3-4% organically over the coming 3-5 years. “The start of the year will be challenging but we expect a significantly stronger second half year,” Chief Executive Mikael Bratt said in a statement. Autoliv’s outlook assumed a further 2-3% fall in global light vehicle output this year after a drop of close to 6% in 2019 and Bratt told Reuters it was too early to call when production would bottom out. Fourth-quarter adjusted operating earnings at Autoliv rose to $242 million from $240 million a year earlier, beating the $230 million seen by analysts, according to Refinitiv estimates. Sweden-listed shares in Autoliv ALIVsdb.ST, which competes with ZF TRW as well as Joyson Safety Systems, were up 3.1% at 1142 GMT, trimming losses this year to 7%."

The company, whose competitors include Joyson Safety Systems and ZF, also said it aimed to grow annual organic sales by 3%-4% above light vehicle production growth on average over a three to five year period. “These targets are challenging, but realistic,” Autoliv CEO Mikael Bratt told Reuters. The company, in a statement ahead of a day of investor presentations at its plant in Ogden, Utah, also said it expected its operating margin would improve in 2020 versus 2019, for which it has forecast a 9% core profit margin. Autoliv shares were down 1% by 1645 GMT, after a strong run in recent months, rising 22% since August. The car industry is in a deep slump, pressured by weak demand and a need to invest in and adapt to electric and self-driving technologies. Autoliv has cut its 2019 growth and margin forecast several times throughout the year. The company said potential tailwinds for next year included a smaller hit from raw material costs, organic growth from market share gains, impact of cost-cutting programmes, and a more stable market. Headwinds could include higher depreciation and amortisation. “Considering these potential tailwinds and headwinds we expect a year-over-year improvement in adjusted operating margin, absent unforeseen events,” Autoliv said. Although global car production is down sharply this year, Autoliv has kept growing slightly, helped by several years of strong order intake in the wake of the collapse of its former rival Takata, now a part of Joyson. Autoliv said order intake had stayed strong in 2019 through October, estimating its global share of orders at about 50%. Looking beyond the next five years, Autoliv said it would aim to grow at least in line with the market and look to increase the margin to about 13% after full implementation of “ongoing and planned strategic initiatives”."

12.824808145604887," Airbag maker Autoliv revs up cost cuts to counter car market slump STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden's Autoliv ALIVsdb.STALV.N said it would step up cost cuts as the car safety equipment maker became the latest casualty of a deteriorating auto industry to lower its 2019 sales growth and profit margin expectations. Several carmakers, including top Autoliv customer Daimler DAIGn.DE, and suppliers have rolled out warnings in recent weeks as an expected recovery in demand has not panned out. Autoliv, the world’s largest seatbelts and airbags maker, said it would cut about 1,000 jobs in areas like sales and R&D and sharpen its purchasing process, adding it had already slashed 1,200 production jobs during the second quarter. CEO Mikael Bratt said car production was at its worst since the financial crisis, with demand weakest in China, where the earlier-than-planned introduction of new emission rules had heightened uncertainty, and Western Europe. ""We see customers here, some who have withdrawn or changed their footprint, and we need to follow that,"" he told Reuters, linking it partly to No. 4 customer Ford's F.N plans to scale back its European presence. “We have been able to drive the efficiency in a good way in the second quarter and we have continued to scrutinise all our costs in the system here and we are stepping up the work here to counterbalance the development in the marketplace.” Bratt said Autoliv would perform some productivity actions sooner than it had planned, with the company’s profitability being hit by higher costs for key raw materials like steel and an indirect impact from suppliers facing tariffs. Autoliv told analysts it had already found ways to mitigate almost all of the expected $30 million hit in the United States from the latest batch of tariffs and that its sharpening of sourcing would cover 75% of its total purchasing costs. Its Stockholm-listed shares held on to gains made before the results report was issued at 1000 GMT. The stock was up 3.0% at 1206 GMT, against a positive broader market. “There was a lot of fear built in ahead of the results, with the persistent theme from all companies being that car production has weakened more than expected,” Handelsbanken Capital Markets analyst Hampus Engellau said. “Autoliv show that they are on the ball and implementing measures, while they are apparently planning for a worse scenario when it comes to global car production.” The company, which competes with Joyson Safety Systems and ZF TRW, forecast for 2019 organic sales growth of 1% to 3% from around 5% forecast earlier, and an adjusted operating margin of 9.0% to 9.5% from about 10.5% previously. This, Autoliv said, was based on its expectations that global light vehicle production would decline 4-6%, a worse decline that forecast by leading agency IHS Markit. It reported a fall in second-quarter operating profit to $170 million from $229 million a year ago. Analysts on an average had expected $199 million according to Refinitiv data."

Weak car production, in mainly China and Europe, has put pressure on sales at Autoliv and its rivals since last year. The company, which competes with Joyson Safety Systems and ZF TRW, reported a first-quarter operating profit of $173 million, down from 243 million a year earlier. This fell short of a $212 million forecast from analysts. Profits were partly hit by one-off costs of more than $20 million due a labor dispute in Mexico.

The Commission, which is responsible for antitrust policy in the 28-nation European Union, said Japan’s Takata was not fined because it revealed the cartels to the Commission. “This is the second time we fine car safety equipment suppliers for participating in a cartel,” Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said. “The three suppliers colluded to increase their profits from the sale of these life-saving components.

The world’s largest maker of airbags and seat-belts said it was maintaining its targets of reaching more than $10 billion in sales and around 13 percent in adjusted operating margin, but no longer expected to reach them in 2020. “Compared to when we put these targets out in 2017 ... there has been a big (drop) in underlying light vehicle production that requires us to push out the targets somewhat,” CEO Mikael Bratt told Reuters. He declined to set a new date for achieving the targets. A string of carmakers and their suppliers have issued warnings in so many months hit by slower demand in China under the strain of Beijing’s trade war with the United States and new emission rules delaying sales in Europe. China, the world’s biggest auto market, is expected to see slower growth this year even as some eurozone economies slow down. Evercore analysts said with the “unrealistic” targets being dropped, they expected 2019 earnings per share consensus to be cut 11-12 percent, with “similar if not greater” moves to 2020 consensus forecasts. Evercore has an “underperform” rating and $70 price target on Autoliv shares. Autoliv’s Stockholm-listed shares were down 2.3 percent at 718.80 Swedish crowns ($79.38) by 1241 GMT. Veoneer, which was spun out of Autoliv last year and focuses on high-tech safety gear for self-driving cars, delayed its 2020 targets in October. Bratt said he expected the first half to be the more challenging half, with weakness stemming mainly from China and Europe at this point. He also forecast that North America sales, a bright spot so far, would move sideways this year but said he expected “no dramatic shift” when asked if U.S. carmakers such as GM ending production of unprofitable car lines was hurting outlook.

The world’s largest maker of airbags and seatbelts said on Friday it was maintaining its targets of reaching more than $10 billion in sales and around 13 percent in adjusted operating margin, but no longer expected to reach them in 2020.

Backman replaces Mathias Hermansson at Veoneer, who announced his resignation in December, prompting a steep fall in Veoneer shares on the day. Veoneer, which makes products such as radars, vision systems and advanced driver assistance systems and was spun out of airbag maker Autoliv earlier in 2018, said Backman would take up his new position in early July at the latest.

-2.247971557642111," Autoliv sets aside $210 million to cover European cartel investigation STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden's Autoliv ALIVsdb.STALV.N is setting aside $210 million this quarter to cover a fine it expects the European Commission to impose after a long-running cartel investigation, the car safety equipment maker said on Thursday. Autoliv, the world’s largest airbag maker, has since 2011 been subject to an investigation of anti-competitive behavior among suppliers of so-called occupant safety systems - such as seatbelts, steering wheels and airbags - in the European Union. The company paid a 8.1 million euro ($9.2 million) fine in the first quarter of this year related to a smaller part of the investigation, completed by the Commission in November 2017. In that part of the investigation, Toyoda Gosei 7282.T, Takata, Marutaka and Tokai Rika 6995.T were also fined for taking part in cartels to fix prices for seatbelts, airbags and steering wheels to Japanese carmakers. “Management now has reason to believe that the EC (European Commission) will seek to impose a fine in connection with the remaining portion of the EC investigation,” Autoliv said in a statement. “According to management’s best estimation and based on the advice of our legal counsel, the company will accrue $210 million in the fourth quarter of 2018 in connection with the remaining portion of the EC investigation.” Autoliv said it believed a fine could be issued in the first half of 2019, but noted it could be delayed. Autoliv's Swedish-listed shares were down 2.7 percent at 0815 GMT, slightly underperforming a 2.5 percent drop for the European automotive sector .SXAP. The company had previously said it believed the outcome of the Commission’s investigation was likely to materially affect operating results. ($1 = 0.8828 euros)"

-0.25232083751702145," Autoliv cuts 2018 sales outlook as slowing China, Europe weighs STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden's Autoliv ALIVsdb.STALV.N, the world's largest maker of airbags and seatbelts, cut its full-year organic sales growth forecast on Friday, citing lower demand in China and the impact of tougher emission tests on car production in Europe. The company, which competes with Joyson Safety Systems and ZF TRW, forecast organic sales growth of around 6 percent this year compared with a mean forecast of 6.5 percent in a poll of analysts and its own previous outlook of 8 percent. The broader automotive sector has come under pressure in recent months from falling car sales in China while the impact of tougher European emissions tests has weighed on auto output in the region, causing several carmakers to warn on profits. “We see a similar environment for the rest of the year, with continued uncertainty for light vehicle production, especially in China and Europe, with continued uneven asset utilization,” Autoliv CEO Mikael Bratt said in a statement. “We are implementing actions to manage these challenges and we look forward to a gradual improvement in operating leverage over time,” he added. Autoliv, which spun out its high-tech safety gear arm Veoneer VNE.N earlier this year, said third-quarter operating profit rose to $193 million from $167 million a year ago, lagging the $205 million forecast in a poll of analysts. While a slowdown dented sales in Europe and China, growth in North America was far stronger at a like-for-like 22 percent on the back of a string of product launches during the quarter. Autoliv's Stockholm-listed stock fell 3.4 percent by 1035 GMT in a bearish market for auto stocks.

1.9291302749765622," Sweden's Veoneer sees up to 2 year delay in achieving income target STOCKHOLM, Oct 25 (Reuters) - Electronic car products maker Veoneer, carved out of Autoliv this year, forecast an up to 2 year delay in reaching its operating income target blaming short-term delays in ramp up and production starts for some car models. The Swedish company, which is focused on high-tech safety gear to target self-driving cars, said it expected to achieve its operating margin target of 0 to 5 percent 1 to 2 years later than its original expectation of 2020. “In the short-term, we see some delays in the start of production and slower ramp-ups of certain customer models along with some slight delays in expected business,” Chief Executive Jan Carlson said in a statement. “These developments result in downside risk to our 2020 total sales target and we are therefore likely to reach $3 billion in total sales slightly later than previously anticipated,” he added.

-18.659899163449804," UPDATE 1-Sweden's Veoneer order intake stays strong, shares jump * Repeats 2020 & 2022 sales target * Order intake “strong”, 15 new orders since May 31 * Higher spending hits Q2 operating profit as expected * Sees limited immediate tariff impact - CEO * Stockholm-listed shares rise 5 pct (Adds details, background, share movement) By Esha Vaish and Johannes Hellstrom STOCKHOLM, July 27 (Reuters) - Swedish electronic car products maker Veoneer, spun off by Autoliv this month, said on Friday order intake was unexpectedly strong over the generally slow summer months and indicated that it may raise a 2022 sales target. Its indication of strong future demand eclipsed weaker than expected quarterly sales growth and operating profit numbers, pushing up its Stockholm-listed stock up 5 percent to 433 Swedish crowns by 1240 GMT. Veoneer is trying to convince investors that it can secure a larger share of the electronics market for self-driving cars and active safety products such as radars, vision systems and autonomous driving software. Investor focus has been on order intake and new customer wins and less on costs and expenses, which the group has already flagged will be higher due to R&D and investment. In its first results as a standalone entity, Veoneer said that strong order momentum noted over the first quarter had continued. Even in the period since its investor day on May 31, it had won 15 new orders, it added. Chief Executive Jan Carlson said it was seeing a trend of “increasing customer activity” across its geographies and products, and take-up rates were potentially higher for its product category active safety. The company may have to look at revising a sales target of $4 billion for 2022 if the current strong momentum continues, he told Reuters on Friday. Higher costs caused the operating loss to widen to $48 million from $12 million in the April-June quarter, exceeding the $31.6 million loss expected by analysts polled by Reuters. Organic sales also shrank 4.5 percent from a year ago, more than the 2.8 percent drop expected, but it maintained its guidance for a 3 percent drop in organic sales in 2018. The impact is from Veoneer phasing out certain contracts for two units and as growth from current order intake will only come through from late 2019 as the industry has long lag times. Engineering groups and their automotive customers also face a threat from a trade war between the U.S. and its trade partners that has led to tariffs on supply chain products and higher raw material costs. But Veoneer, which imports some electronic control units from Canada, expects the direct impact from trade tariffs to be negligible as it looks now, Carlson said.

-18.659899163449804," UPDATE 1-Autoliv Q2 profit tops forecast, but 2018 growth outlook cut (Adds CEO comment, shares, background, detail) STOCKHOLM, July 27 (Reuters) - Sweden’s Autoliv , the world’s largest maker of airbags and seatbelts, reported forecast-beating second-quarter operating earnings on Friday but cut its organic sales growth outlook for 2018, taking the shine off the profit beat. In its maiden report since spinning off its electronics business Veoneer , Autoliv said its operating profit rose to $229 million from $220 million a year ago, beating the $206 million forecast in a Reuters poll of analysts. The company, which rivals Joyson Safety Systems and ZF TRW, however forecast organic sales growth of around 8 percent this year compared with a 9.5 percent mean poll forecast, and its own previous outlook for 10 percent. Autoliv’s Swedish shares, which had dropped in the past week on the back of 2018 profit forecast cuts from major carmakers such as General Motors and Ford, were down 1.0 percent at 1151 GMT. Chief Executive Mikael Bratt told Reuters the outlook cut was “entirely related” to underlying car production forecasts, with several things currently impacting the market, including new emissions standards in Europe and the threat of trade wars. “We carefully monitor the development of issues fundamental to our business such as possible NAFTA renegotiations and various trade barriers on raw materials and automotive products,” Autoliv said in a statement. The company has been winning a lot of new business in recent years at the expense of collapsed Japanese rival Takata, which has been at the centre of the auto industry’s biggest-ever recall and filed for bankruptcy last year. Takata was bought by Key Safety Systems earlier this year, and the joint company was renamed Joyson Safety Systems. As it can often take as much as two years before orders translate into sales, Autoliv is only recently starting to see the impact of the new business it has won.

-15.872883975289575," UPDATE 1-Sweden's Autoliv reports record orders for Veoneer before spin-off (Adds CEO comments, background, detail, shares) STOCKHOLM, May 31 (Reuters) - Autoliv , the world’s largest maker of airbags and seatbelts, said it had seen record order intake over the past 12 months for its electronics business Veoneer and raised its longer-term forecast for some of its products. The Swedish company, which plans to spin-off and list Veoneer in early July, said the electronics unit had recorded a 48 percent jump to $1.1 billion in annual order intake in the past 12 months. Autoliv’s passive safety business, which makes products such as airbags and seatbelts, has won a bigger market share at the expense of collapsed rival Takata in recent years. The passive safety business will retain the Autoliv name after the split. But the company still has to convince investors that Veoneer can secure a larger share of its electronics market focused on self-driving cars and active safety products such as radars, vision systems, advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous driving software. Autoliv repeated its targets for 2020 and 2022 for both its passive safety and electronics units. “Our confidence in the targets is rising as we see the increasing order intake,” Autoliv CEO Jan Carlson told Reuters in a interview ahead of investor presentations on Thursday. Carlson, who is taking the helm at Veoneer and leaving his position at Autoliv, said more than $600 million of Veoneer’s $1.1 billion order intake referred to the fast-growing active safety segment. This compared to nearly $450 million in 2017. Autoliv also said it now saw a greater potential upside in its active safety market business, prompting it to marginally increase its 2025 sales target for this part of Veoneer to more than $4 billion from a previous estimate of around $4 billion. Carlson said virtually all of Veoneer’s $3 billion sales target in 2020 was already reflected in booked orders, while “more than half” of the $4 billion target in 2022 target was already orders on hand. In the electronics business, Autoliv faces rivals such as Aptiv and Intel. Competitors on the passive safety side include firms such as ZF and Key Safety Systems (KSS). Autoliv shares, which are up more than 20 percent this year, rose 0.1 percent in early trading in Stockholm on Thursday.

The Swedish automotive supplier said its first-quarter operating profit rose to $225 million from $218 million in the year-ago quarter, lagging a mean forecast for $230 million in a Reuters analyst poll. The group’s operating margin in the quarter also marginally missed analysts’ expectations. While it broke with tradition in not guiding for sales growth and margins for the group, it maintained its outlook for its two arms - Passive Safety and Electronics - which are due to become separately listed companies later this year. That guidance sees a rise in underlying profitability for Passive Safety this year while core margins are set to fall for the Electronics segment, which is investing heavily in emerging technologies such as autonomous vehicles. The company makes radar products, vision systems and advanced driver assistance software in its Electronics business, while Passive safety includes airbags and seatbelts and generates the bulk of company earnings. “The product launches in Passive Safety are generally on track and its order intake continued to be on a high level in the quarter,” Chief Executive Jan Carlson said in a statement.
