-15.03379345385866," TSMC to raise $9 billion for expansion, open Japan subsidiary TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) said on Tuesday it would raise nearly $9 billion from the debt markets to help fund expansion and spend around $178 million to open a Japanese material research subsidiary. The world’s top contract chipmaker last month posted its best-ever quarterly profit and hiked revenue and capital spending estimates to record levels as it forecast “multiple years of growth opportunities”. Taiwan’s tech firms have benefited from soaring demand for chips that go into laptops, tablets, smartphones and other products to support the work and study at home boom around the world during the COVID-19 pandemic. They are working hard too to address a shortage of chips for automakers. In a statement after a board meeting, the company said the board had approved the issuance of unsecured corporate bonds domestically not exceeding T$120 billion ($4.29 billion). It also approved the provision of a guarantee to wholly-owned subsidiary TSMC Global for its issuance of U.S. dollar-denominated senior unsecured corporate bonds not to exceed $4.5 billion. The money raised would “finance TSMC’s capacity expansion and/or pollution prevention-related expenditures”, it said, without elaborating. The company said in January it expected to raise capital spending on the production and development of advanced chips to $25 billion-$28 billion this year, as much as 60% higher than the amount it spent in 2020. In its statement on the board meeting, it said the board had approved capital appropriations of approximately $11.79 billion for fab construction, installation and upgrade of advanced technology capacity and “second quarter 2021 R&D capital investments and sustaining capital expenditures”. TSMC also said the board had approved the establishment of a wholly owned Japanese subsidiary in Japan to expand three-dimensional integrated circuit (3DIC) material research, with a paid-in capital of not more than 18.6 billion yen ($178 million).

-11.527583810252382," SoftBank's Son hails 'golden eggs' as Vision Fund rallies TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp Chief Executive Masayoshi Son boasted of delivering “golden eggs” on Monday, after his company’s Vision Fund unit rebounded from a loss to record an 844 billion yen ($8 billion) third quarter profit. The profit marks a sea change from a year earlier when high-profile misses such as the flopped IPO of office sharing firm WeWork and the COVID-19 pandemic forced Son to sell assets to stabilise his investing empire. “Our vision never changed,” Son told a news conference in Tokyo after his company announced its latest results. “Golden eggs are not produced by chance,” he added, returning to a favoured analogy that describes SoftBank as a goose that backs fast-growing companies such as Alibaba that are its golden eggs. One of Japan’s wealthiest people, Son is viewed as a maverick in a business culture that generally eschews risk taking. Rock bottom interest rates and frothy markets that have driven tech stock gains have helped the turnaround at his Vision Fund unit. Softbank-backed firms that went public during the quarter include selling platform Opendoor and food delivery app operator Doordash, with unrealised gains in the latter totalling $10.7 billion. Son, who was dressed in a white turtleneck and dark suit, said he had turned to back-to-back online meetings to run his investing empire during the pandemic. Almost half of the first Vision Fund’s portfolio, which includes a stake in Uber Technologies, was exited or listed at the end of December, offering liquidity to the fund backed by the sovereign wealth funds of Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi. The $100 billion Vision Fund’s 82 investments were valued at $90 billion, compared with their purchase price of $76.3 billion. The fund has recorded $20.4 billion in gross gains since inception. Vision Fund 2’s 26 investments were valued at $9.3 billion compared with their purchase price of $4.3 billion. SoftBank is currently the fund’s only investor. Portfolio companies held 28 funding rounds during 2020 with almost all led by investors other that SoftBank, reflecting the appetite for technology startups. “You wouldn’t say Vision Fund is laying rotten eggs,” Son said, who waved his arms like a music conductor standing before an animation of golden eggs emerging from a cartoon goose. Softbank’s trading unit SB Northstar, which has been investing the group’s cash reserves, disclosed stakes in listed tech stocks including American Despository Receipts in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co worth $22 billion at the end of December. The unit booked a $2.7 billion derivative loss during the quarter. Son said SB Northstar’s performance has improved since the start of the year and that it is still in a trial phase. Chinese regulators halted the bumper IPO of Alibaba’s fintech affiliate Ant in November. Son, whose shares in Alibaba are his largest asset, said China is becoming more concerned about antitrust and financial regulation but this is necessary for companies that will continue to grow. Alibaba founder Jack Ma, who has been mostly out of the public eye since the IPO halt, has been drawing pictures and sending them to Son, he said. The Japanese billionaire said he has also been drawing before bed. During the third quarter, Softbank Group’s net profit ballooned more than 20 times to 1.17 trillion yen ($11.09 billion). That compared with an estimate of 171 billion yen from four analysts polled by Refinitiv SmartEstimate. ($1 = 105.5000 yen)"

Automakers around the world are shutting assembly lines due to the shortages, which in some cases have been exacerbated by the former U.S. administration’s actions against Chinese chip factories. Taiwan’s economy minister said on Wednesday major Taiwanese chipmakers were willing to prioritise supplies for automakers, after she met senior company executives including from TSMC.

While our capacity is fully utilised with demand from every sector, TSMC is reallocating our wafer capacity to support the worldwide automotive industry.” In 2020, auto chips accounted only for 3% of TSMC’s sales, lagging smartphones’ 48% and 33% for high-performance chips. In the fourth quarter, sales for TSMC’s auto chips jumped 27% from the previous quarter, but still only accounted for 3% of overall sales. The issue has become a diplomatic one, with German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier writing to his Taiwanese counterpart Wang Mei-hua to ask her for help in addressing it. Wang said the other companies whose executives she met were from United Microelectronics Corp (UMC), Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp and Vanguard International Semiconductor Corp. UMC Co-President Jason Wang, speaking on an investor call late Wednesday, said their fabs were also operating at a 100% utilisation rate and that they were trying to address the auto chip shortage. “It’s hard to increase the capacity. It’s more about re-prioritising. Prioritising the automotive market, so hopefully we can relieve some of the pressure,” he said. “Some of the capacity increase will come from productivity improvement and for those the priority will probably be allocated to automotive at the current time.” UMC Chief Financial Officer Chitung Liu added that the company’s commitment to their non-auto customers “will not change”. UMC does not break down details for auto chips in terms of how much they contribute to revenue or their share of production. The company declined to comment on the meeting with minister Wang. Taipei-based research group TrendForce said in a research note this week that integrated chips for auto use need to be highly reliable and have a long lifespan as they are generally used in high-temperature and high-pressure operating environments. “So it is usually not easy to switch over production lines and supply chains,” it said.

A ministry official said Minister Wang Mei-hua spoke to senior company executives on Sunday about the issue. TSMC had told the ministry it will “optimise” the production process of chips to make it more efficient and prioritise auto chip production if it is able to further increase capacity, the ministry said. TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker, stated that current production capacity is full, but had assured the ministry that “if production can be increased by optimising production capacity, it will cooperate with the government to regard automotive chips as a primary application”. TSMC, in a statement to Reuters, referred to comments from its Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei on an earnings call this month. “Other than continuously maximising utilisation of our existing capacity, Dr. Wei also confirmed in our investors’ conference that we are working with customers closely and moving some of their mature nodes to more advanced nodes, where we have better capacity to support them,” the company said. Germany has asked Taiwan to persuade Taiwanese manufacturers to help ease a shortage of semiconductor chips in the auto sector which is hampering its fledgling economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. The request was made in a letter from German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier to Wang. The ministry said it would wait until it had received the letter before deciding on whether to contact TSMC again. Automakers around the world are shutting assembly lines due to problems in the delivery of semiconductors, which in some cases have been exacerbated by the former Trump administration’s actions against key Chinese chip factories. The shortage has affected Volkswagen, Ford Motor Co, Subaru Corp, Toyota Motor Corp, Nissan Motor Co Ltd, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and other car makers. The ministry told Reuters that it had received requests from both the United States and the European Union through “diplomatic channels” late last year, as well as from Germany and Japan this year. It said that in the second quarter of last year auto companies cut orders to TSMC, which in turn shifted capacity to other clients, but in the second half of the year demand for auto chips returned. “The Americans did express the expectation late last year,” the ministry said. “At the moment everyone is talking to each other through diplomatic channels, including TSMC. Everyone’s hands are tied with orders, but from the government’s perspective we will try to help as much as we can for our important allies.” A European Commission spokesman said there had been “no specific discussions” with Taiwan but that they were monitoring the auto chip shortage situation closely.

-10.36510921302572," Intel floats possibility of licensing deals but would TSMC and Samsung be interested? (Reuters) - Intel Corp executives have raised the possibility of licensing chipmaking technology from outside firms, a move that could see it exchanging manufacturing secrets with rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) or Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. Intel is one of the few remaining semiconductor firms that both designs and manufactures its own chips, but the business model has come into question in recent years as the company lost its manufacturing lead to the Taiwanese and Korean companies. One option urged by some investors would be to outsource manufacturing. The company said, however, on Thursday that while it plans to increase its use of outside factories, the majority of its 2023 products would be made internally. But licensing technology could help Intel avoid major investments in rivals’ factories that outsourcing deals would likely entail. “Broadly speaking, that may mean sharing technologies that we have that they could use or leveraging technologies that others have developed that we can use as well,” outgoing Chief Executive Bob Swan told an earnings call. That said, questions remain over how much a licensing deal would cost and whether a rival firm would even be interested. Intel did not name companies it might license from but TSMC and Samsung are its only competitors for high-end chips. “It seems a little weird to me that TSMC would give away to the keys to the kingdom unless there’s a sizeable payment that went with it,” said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst with Bernstein.

Taiwan’s MediaTek appears to be one of the first high-volume customers for the technology and is among a handful of companies with modem technology to connect phones to mobile data networks, competing against Qualcomm Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. The new chips announced Wednesday, called Dimensity 1100 and 1200, build on MediaTek’s efforts to go after higher-priced handsets where Qualcomm’s Snapdragon chips have historically had stronger market share. Like Qualcomm and Apple, MediaTek designs chips and then contracts out production to outside firms. The newest chips will be made at TSMC, on a chipmaking technology called 6-nanometer. Qualcomm’s chips are being made by Samsung on 5-nanometer technology while Apple Inc uses TSMC’s 5-nanometer technology. Smaller chipmaker technology is faster and more power efficient. MediaTek’s previous chips used a 7-nanometer process, and moving to newer manufacturing technology along with advances in the chip’s design make it 22% faster at computing tasks while consuming 25% less power, Finbarr Moynihan, general manager of international corporate sales, told Reuters in an interview."
-4.076474517248605," TSMC logs highest quarterly profit, sees record revenue and capital spending TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) posted its best-ever quarterly profit and hiked revenue and capital spending estimates to record levels as it forecast “multiple years of growth opportunities”. The world’s top contract chipmaker has become increasingly bullish as remote work amid the coronavirus pandemic drives demand for advanced chips to power premium devices - demand that is expected to continue to surge as 5G technology and artificial intelligence applications are adopted more widely. TSMC now expects to lift capital spending on the production and development of advanced chips to between $25 billion-$28 billion this year, as much as 60% higher than the amount it spent in 2020. It also revised up its compound annual growth rate targets for revenue during the 2020 to 2025 period to 10%-15% from an earlier estimate of 5%-10%. Demand for chips has been so high that manufacturers around the world are sounding alarm bells about shortages. Several car makers have seen production plans hit by insufficient supply, leading TSMC to see a jump in demand from automakers in the fourth quarter. “We are working with our customers to mitigate the shortage impact,” Chief Executive Officer C. C. Wei told analysts in an online earnings briefing without elaborating. The shortages have several causes, industry executives and analysts say, including bulk-buying by U.S. sanctions-hit Chinese tech giant Huawei Technologies, a fire at a chip plant in Japan, coronavirus lockdowns in Southeast Asia, and a strike in France. More fundamentally, however, there has been under-investment in 8-inch chip manufacturing plants owned mostly by Asian firms, which means they have struggled to ramp up production as demand for 5G phones, laptops and cars picked up faster than expected. Partly helped by the launch of Apple Inc’s iPhone 12, TSMC’s net profit for the October-December fourth quarter soared 23% to T$142.8 billion ($5.1 billion), beating a Refinitiv consensus estimate of T$135.39 billion. Revenue jumped 22% to a record $12.68 billion. TSMC predicted first-quarter revenue would hit a new record of between $12.7 billion and $13 billion, versus $10.3 billion in the same period a year earlier.

-4.076474517248605," Breakingviews - Taiwan's tech edge will cushion U.S. policy tumult HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - Taiwan’s technology know-how should provide a diplomatic edge. TSMC, the $560 billion chipmaking powerhouse, showcases the island’s clout in international supply chains and beyond. That bodes well for bilateral trade and investment flows, even as geopolitical uncertainties mount. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is leading a rebound in the trade-dependent economy. Strong demand for semiconductors worldwide, combined with President Tsai Ing-wen’s successful containment of Covid-19, helped boost exports to a record $345 billion in 2020. TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker, grew annual sales by a quarter, to $48 billion, with more financial results due out later on Thursday. Its shares have surged 75% over the past year, thanks to a relentless march on rivals in developing cutting-edge chips for everything from 5G smartphones to self-driving cars. A chaotic presidential transition in Washington, however, has dampened the mood in Taipei, where Tsai has benefited from fresh U.S.-China tensions under President Donald Trump. American arms sales to Taiwan topped $5 billion in 2020, according to Reuters, while diplomatic engagements have been at their strongest in years. Outgoing Secretary of State Mike Pompeo last week announced he was lifting restrictions on contacts between U.S. officials and their Taiwanese counterparts. The unprecedented move prompted fierce condemnation from Beijing, which claims the democratic island as its own territory. It’s no wonder that over half those polled in Taiwan favoured a Trump re-election, according to an October survey conducted by the Taiwan Public Opinion Foundation. President-elect Joe Biden is likely to be less antagonistic to China. Fears that he would roll back support for the island were heightened on Tuesday when a planned visit by the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations was cancelled. The decision may be part of the transition to the incoming administration but follows another postponed trip by a senior U.S. official in November. The two economies are nevertheless growing closer, particularly as the United States seeks to develop advanced technologies at home. Intel may soon outsource chip production to TSMC, joining a long list of American giants like Apple and Qualcomm that rely on Taiwanese components. Those sorts of ties can withstand political ructions."

It is part of a plan TSMC announced in May to build a $12 billion factory in Arizona, in an apparent win by the Trump administration in its push to wrestle global tech supply chains back from China. TSMC plans to set up a 12-inch wafer fabrication plant in Phoenix, Arizona and the facility is expected to start volume production in 2024, Taiwan’s investment commission of the ministry of economic affairs said in a statement. TSMC manufactures the bulk of its chips in Taiwan and has older chip facilities in China and the U.S. state of Washington. The company has said construction of the Arizona facility would start in 2021, with production slated to begin in 2024, producing up to 20,000 silicon wafers a month.

39.48008302916197," Phoenix okays development deal with TSMC for $12 billion chip factory (Reuters) - City officials in Phoenix, Arizona on Wednesday unanimously voted to authorize a development agreement with chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co that would provide $205 million in city funds for infrastructure such as roads and water improvements for a planned $12 billion semiconductor factory in the city. TSMC is the world’s biggest contract chipmaker and manufactures semiconductors for Apple Inc, Qualcomm Inc and a range of other technology companies. The company in May disclosed its intentions to build a 5-nanometer chip factory in Arizona, which would be its first advanced manufacturing facility in the United States. Earlier this month it approved an investment to set up a wholly owned subsidiary in the U.S. state with paid-in capital of $3.5 billion. The Phoenix City Council voted to allow the city to enter the agreement by a vote of 9-0. Ahead of the vote, Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego called the agreement “a great success across so many levels of government in helping Arizona become a leader in advanced manufacturing.” Under the agreement, TSMC will build a new factory and create 1,900 new full-time jobs to be phased in over a five-year period. Construction would start in early 2021, with factory production expected in 2024. In return, the city will build three miles of streets for $61 million, spend $37 million on water infrastructure improvements and $107 million in wastewater improvements. The company will enter a formal deal with the city after selecting a site, which is expected before the end of the year. Based in Hsinchu, Taiwan, TSMC has said it also hopes for U.S. federal subsidies to help cover the extra cost of building chips in the United States. Most of the world’s advanced semiconductors are manufactured in Taiwan, including those used in U.S. military equipment, which has become a cause for concern as tensions increase between the United States and China. American lawmakers in June proposed billions of dollars in subsides to help bolster advanced semiconductor manufacturing in the United States. Those funds could benefit both TSMC as well as U.S. firms such as Intel Corp and Micron Technology Inc."

50.69876303551584," UPDATE 1-ASMI raises Q4 guidance on expectations of strong demand Oct 28 (Reuters) - Dutch semiconductor manufacturing equipment supplier ASM International on Wednesday raised its guidance for the fourth quarter, saying it expected strong demand for wafer fabrication equipment. The company, which supplies Intel Corp and Apple supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) , raised its guidance for fourth quarter sales to 330-350 million euros. It previously saw fourth-quarter sales in line with the third quarter. Sales in the July to September period fell by 8% to 315 million euros, within its forecast of 300-320 million euros ($732.78 million). “Supported by a continued healthy market development in the second half we now expect the wafer fab equipment (WFE) market to grow with a high single to low double digit percentage in 2020,” the company said in a statement. Wafer fabrication creates repeated sequential processes to produce circuits on semiconductor wafers. The gross profit margin in the third quarter stood at 49.9%, up from 48.3% in the previous quarter."
40.991404296057084," AMD to buy chip peer Xilinx for $35 billion in data center push (Reuters) - Semiconductor designer Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD) said on Tuesday it would buy Xilinx Inc in a $35 billion all-stock deal, intensifying its battle with Intel Corp in the data center chip market. The deal, which AMD expects to close at the end of 2021, will create a combined company with 13,000 engineers and a completely outsourced manufacturing strategy that relies heavily on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC). The two U.S. companies have benefited from a more nimble approach to grab market share from Intel, which has struggled with internal manufacturing. AMD has long been Intel’s chief rival for central processor units (CPUs) in the personal computer business. Since Chief Executive Lisa Su took over AMD in 2014, she has focused on challenging Intel in the fast-growing business of data centers that power internet-based applications and services and are fueling the rise of artificial intelligence and fifth-generation telecommunications networks. Xilinx has also been working to penetrate data centers with programmable processors that help speed up specialized tasks such as compressing videos or providing digital encryption. Its primary rival in the area, Altera Corp, was scooped up by Intel for $16.7 billion in 2015 in what was then Intel’s largest-ever deal. “There are some areas where we’re very strong, and we will be able to accelerate some of the adoption of the Xilinx product family,” Su told Reuters in an interview. “And there are some areas where (Xilinx CEO) Victor (Peng) is very strong, and we believe that we’ll be able to accelerate some of the AMD products into those markets.” The tie-up comes at a time when Intel’s manufacturing technology has fallen years behind TSMC’s. AMD, which spun off its factories nearly a decade ago, has rocketed ahead of Intel with chips that perform better. The performance edge helped AMD gain its best market share since 2013 at slightly less than 20% of the CPU market, which has in turn pushed its shares up 79% this year. Shares of AMD were down 1.8% shortly after markets opened at 9:30 a.m. ET (1330 GMT), while those of Xilinx surged nearly 12% after the two companies held a joint conference call about the deal. Xilinx also uses TSMC’s factories, called “fabs” in the industry, to make its chips, with both U.S. companies using modular designs that let them swap out different pieces of a chip to avoid bottlenecks or delays. “We ended up with TSMC, and have stayed with them, not due to any contractual reason - we could go to any fab at any time - but because they are best-in-class,” Peng told Reuters in an interview. “It’s about the choices you make.” Under the deal, Xilinx shareholders will receive about 1.7 shares of AMD common stock for each share of Xilinx common stock, valuing Xilinx at $143 per share based on a 10-day average for AMD share prices up to Oct. 8, or about 24.8% higher than its $114.55 closing price on Oct. 26. AMD shareholders will own about 74% of the combined firm, with Xilinx shareholders owning the remaining 26%. AMD’s Su will lead the combined company as chief executive, with Xilinx’s Peng serving as president responsible for the Xilinx business and strategic growth initiatives. The companies expect the deal to generate $300 million in cost savings. AMD also reported earnings on Tuesday earlier than scheduled. It reported revenue and adjusted earnings of $2.80 billion and 41 cents per share, beating Wall Street expectations of $2.57 billion and 36 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Bernstein analyst Stacy Rasgon said there is a danger that a major acquisition in an adjacent chip market could distract AMD’s leadership while Intel fights to regain market share. “The worry would be, AMD has this great self-grown story of their own, which is just starting to play out. Why are you doing this now? Is it just opportunistic? Does it distract from the current story?” he said. Xilinx’s Peng, however, said meetings between the two companies have already revealed they have very similar methods for designing chips. “I’ll be honest, I don’t think it’s really as challenging as some other combinations,” he said. “I had one of my leadership teams who was not familiar with AMD say to me after a meeting, ‘Boy, they’re just like us.’”"

42.66407137452104," A bullish TSMC lifts revenue estimate as COVID transforms digital demand TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) hiked its revenue outlook after logging record quarterly profit, and painted a bullish picture of demand picking up over the next two years as advanced technologies are adopted more widely. The chip sector has been one of the rare industries benefiting from the coronavirus pandemic with more people investing in premium devices as they spend longer hours at home and as corporations seek to add more bandwidth for remote workers. The world’s largest contract chipmaker said it now expects 2020 revenue to jump more than 30%, up from an earlier forecast of more than 20% and marking the second quarter in a row it has lifted its outlook. It predicted fourth-quarter revenue of between $12.4 billion and $12.7 billion, compared with $10.4 billion booked in the same quarter a year ago. “COVID has accelerated the digital transformation,” Chief Executive C.C. Wei told an online earnings briefing, adding that robust demand for smartphones and other electronics as well as 5G technologies had spurred orders for high-end chips. Wei said TSMC’s clients were currently holding inventories at higher than historical levels due to uncertainties amid the pandemic and geopolitical tensions. Even so the company expects demand to pick up in 2021 and 2022, offsetting any inventory correction. “We don’t worry too much about it,” he said. Wei emphasised that TSMC’s position as the industry leader in advanced chips would hold it in good stead and that it is expected to outperform global foundry growth this year. In July-September, TSMC’s net profit surged 36% to a record T$137.3 billion ($4.8 billion), well ahead of market expectations for T$124.9 billion. Revenue handily beat the company’s own estimates, climbing 29.2% to $12.1 billion. TSMC’s advanced chips are used in high-end smartphones such as Apple’s newly unveiled 5G iPhone 12 as well as in telecommunications technology and artificial intelligence. TSMC expects to see 5G-enabled devices quickly gain widespread popularity, predicting the uptake for 5G would be faster than for 4G. “All countries and regions are preparing to build up (5G) infrastructure right now...a lot of 5G phones will be introduced and that created a higher percentage penetration rate,” Wei said. This demand has helped TSMC offset a loss of orders from Huawei after the U.S. imposed extensive restrictions on sales to the Chinese telecommunications giant. A U.S. proposal to also put Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC) on the same trade blacklist has caused some of the Chinese chipmaker’s clients to preemptively switch over to its Taiwanese rival, analysts have said. TSMC declined to comment on reports it had applied for a U.S. licence to ship some products to Huawei. Asked about the implications of restrictions on SMIC, executives just said they were evaluating the impact on the semiconductor market. Shares of TSMC have jumped about 36% so far this year, giving it a market value of $414 billion. ($1 = 28.7260 Taiwan dollars)"

33.72407854232511," TSMC warns China-U.S. deleveraging will drive up costs TAIPEI (Reuters) - The deleveraging of China-U.S. supply chains and protectionism on both sides of the Pacific will only drive up costs and limit the flow of ideas, the chairman of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd 2330.TW said on Wednesday. The Trump administration has limited supplies to Chinese tech firms like Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, viewing them as a security threat, and is encouraging U.S. factories in China to move home, part of a broader China-U.S. trade war. China, for its part, is trying to nurture tech champions of its own like SMIC 0981.HK, its biggest chipmaker, and wean itself off reliance on U.S. suppliers. Speaking at a semiconductor conference in Taipei, TSMC chairman Mark Liu said over the last four decades the industry had benefited from the free global flow of information. “But in the future the climate may change. The information flow may not be that free. Tariffs may be erected. So we have to prepare for that,” said Liu, whose company is the world’s biggest contract chipmaker. “One thing is the competition will be stronger. Secondly, the cost of production or development will be higher because one cannot leverage the whole world like in the past,” he said. Taiwanese firms like TSMC - a major supplier to the likes of Apple Inc AAPL.O and Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O - have to improve their own technology to respond and remind the world how important the island's companies are, Liu said. “Because either side of the Pacific is trying to do their self-sufficient supply chains. They want to do it themselves,” he said. “Use Taiwan’s engineers’ ingenuity to lift our technology level up.” TSMC has become caught up in the China-U.S. tension, saying in July it had stopped taking new orders from Huawei in May and did not plan to ship wafers after Sept. 15, responding to U.S. curbs on supplying the Chinese company. TSMC also plans to build a $12 billion factory in Arizona, in an apparent win for the Trump administration’s efforts to wrestle global tech supply chains back from China."

Shares of Samsung Electronics rose as much as 5.8% at one point to their highest level in about five months and were on track to finish higher for a third consecutive session. Intel said on Thursday its new 7-nanometer chip technology was six months behind schedule and it would consider farming out more work to outside semiconductor foundries. The U.S. chipmaker also said on Monday that its chief engineering officer had left the company. “Samsung could benefit as Intel will outsource more chip manufacturing,” Nomura analyst C.W. Chung said. “The foundry business accounts for a small portion of Samsung’s total revenue, but this does not mean that the foundry industry is small.” Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) also extended gains on Tuesday, jumping 5% after hitting a record-high on Monday on Intel’s woes. With a market value of 11.66 trillion new Taiwan dollars ($398 billion), TSMC has a higher market capitalisation than Samsung Electronics, a diversified tech giant which is valued at 369.18 trillion won as of Tuesday.

High-performance chips used in 5G telecommunications and other new technologies have been in strong demand, particularly as more people work from home and companies scramble to add more bandwidth amid the coronavirus pandemic. The world’s largest contract chipmaker estimated third-quarter revenue could climb as much 22% from a year earlier to $11.5 billion, a forecast that comes despite losing Huawei Technologies Co Ltd as a customer after the United States slapped a ban on selling to the Chinese company. It now sees revenue this year up more than 20%, compared with an April target of “mid- to high-teens” percentage growth. “We expect our business to be supported by strong demand for our industry-leading 5 nanometre and 7 nanometre technologies, driven by 5G smartphones, high-performance computing and IoT-related applications,” Chief Financial Officer Wendell Huang told a briefing. April-June net profit came in at T$120.8 billion ($4.1 billion), 8% ahead of market expectations, while revenue for the quarter climbed 34.1% to $10.4 billion. Underscoring its bullish outlook, it lifted capital spending plans for this year to $16-$17 billion from a prior estimate of $15-$16 billion. It spent $14.9 billion in 2019. TSMC, which counts Apple Inc and Qualcomm Inc among its customers, said it has made decent progress in filling up capacity since the loss of Huawei orders. It stopped taking new orders from the Chinese telecommunications and smartphone giant in May and does not plan to ship wafers after Sept. 15. TSMC unveiled plans for a $12 billion plant in Arizona in May, a move widely seen as currying favour with the United States as Washington spars with over Beijing over trade and Huawei. The plant will make advanced 5 nanometre chips and is due to start operating in 2024, targeting production of 20,000 wafers per month, the company said on Thursday. TSMC also said it expects the global market for contract chip manufacturing to show mid- to high-teens percentage growth this year, up from a previous forecast of a high single-digit to low teens percentage growth. TSMC shares have risen about 10% this year, giving it a market value of $320 billion, overtaking U.S. rival Intel Corp which now has a market value of $249 billion."

44.45631083190895," Taiwan minister says TSMC has offset lost Huawei orders TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) 2330.TW has made up its order book with other customers now that it has lost China's Huawei Technologies Co Ltd [HWT.UL], which is subject to U.S. sales restrictions, a government minister said on Monday. TSMC’s clients include Huawei’s chip division HiSilicon. However, the U.S. blacklisting of Huawei over security concerns and trade disputes with China has left the world’s biggest contract chipmaker exposed to diplomatic developments between two countries where it also has production bases. Last month, the company unveiled plans for a $12-billion plant in the United States just hours before the U.S. Commerce Department outlined a proposal to amend chip export rules - a move that would restrict TSMC’s sales to Huawei. The amendment would require licences for sales of semiconductors made abroad with U.S. technology to Huawei, the world’s biggest supplier of telecoms equipment and its second-largest smartphone maker. Kung Ming-hsin, the new head of Taiwan’s economic planning agency, the National Development Council, said the United States was taking aim at a specific company, not Taiwan’s economic relations with China, the island’s largest trading partner. “The United States has not asked Taiwan to cut off all ties with China. It’s aimed at Huawei,” Kung told reporters in Taipei. The main reason the United States has targeted Huawei is because it was not transparent and had too close a relationship with the Chinese government, he added, charges the company has denied. “As for TSMC, although their orders no longer have Huawei, they’ve quickly been filled up, as other people really need them,” Kung said, without elaborating. TSMC declined to comment, saying it did not comment on its customers. The chairman of TSMC, a supplier to U.S. tech giants such as Apple Inc AAPL.O, said this month the firm could quickly fill any order gap should U.S. curbs prevent sales to Huawei."

""But if it does, we will replace it in a very short time,"" he said in the northern Taiwanese city of Hsinchu, where the Apple Inc AAPL.O and Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O supplier is based. “It’s difficult for me to predict how fast it could be filled immediately.” Liu said TSMC is watching how the rules are implemented and is “still studying” what they mean for the company. He said TSMC does not rule out the possibility of applying for an exemption. Analysts estimate TSMC generates around 60% of revenue from the United States and 20% from China. TSMC is not the only company impacted by Sino-U.S. tension, Liu said. “Please be reassured. We will find a solution,” he said, answering a shareholder question on concerns about any impact on TSMC. “We will overcome the challenges one by one.” TSMC’s U.S. investment plan is “definitely in line with” the company’s interests, and will help the firm gain the trust of clients and boost its talent pool, Liu said. TSMC is still in talks with the U.S. government about subsidies for its new plant to make up for cost differences between Taiwan and the United States, and while the plant will not have direct dealings with the military, some clients might be military suppliers, he said. Liu was upbeat on overall tech demand, even as the coronavirus outbreak has ravaged the global economy. “Everyone can see that iPhone sales are still pretty good.”"
49.27512762482401," Senate Democrats call for Trump administration to unveil details of TSMC plant deal WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic lawmakers on Tuesday urged the Trump administration to answer “serious questions” about Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd’s plans to build a U.S.-based $12 billion plant, flagging national security concerns and potentially undisclosed subsidies. TSMC, the world’s biggest contract chipmaker and supplier to U.S. tech giants such as Apple Inc, announced the project last week, in a move trumpeted by Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross as signaling a “renaissance in American manufacturing” fueled by President Donald Trump. In a letter addressed Tuesday to Ross and Defense Secretary Mark Esper, top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer and two colleagues said they “strongly support” efforts by the administration to “on-shore” semiconductor plants in the United States. But Schumer, along with Patrick Leahy and Jack Reed, urged more transparency and asked the government to consider “companies that already have built a significant presence in the U.S.”, citing Micron, GlobalFoundries and Cree. “We have serious questions as to how this project takes into consideration national security requirements and how it aligns with a broader strategy for building a diverse U.S. semiconductor manufacturing supply chain,” the men wrote of the TSMC plan. “We ask that you cease any such negotiations or discussions until you have briefed the relevant authorization and appropriations committees with your plans, including any commitments you have made to funding, tax breaks, licensures, or other incentives,” they added. Commerce, the Pentagon and TSMC did not immediately respond to requests for comment. TSMC, which is a key supplier to Chinese telecoms giant Huawei, has found itself in the cross fire of a global technology battle between Washington and Beijing. The Taiwanese firm will likely be hit by a new U.S. rule aimed at curbing global chip supplies to Huawei, which it placed on a black list last year on national security grounds. But the U.S. government also negotiated with TSMC for years to open a U.S.-based plant, Reuters reported, as it seeks to bring more chip manufacturing onshore."

62.227901888088056," U.S. gave no assurances to Taiwan's TSMC for license to sell to Huawei: official WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd, which unveiled a $12 billion investment plan in Arizona on Friday, has not been given any assurances that it will be granted a license to allow it to sell U.S. technology to China’s Huawei, a senior U.S. official said. TSMC, the world’s biggest contract chipmaker, announced its plans on Friday just hours before the Trump administration outlined a proposal to amend tech export rules that could restrict TSMC’s sales to Huawei, which is blacklisted by the United States because it is considered a national security threat.

58.62688213093373," Taiwan's TSMC keeps eye on China with $12 billion U.S. plant SHANGHAI/TAIPEI (Reuters) - In a race to position itself in the latest trade battle between the United States and China, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd made it just under the wire. The world’s biggest contract chipmaker unveiled plans for a $12 billion plant in Arizona on Friday just hours before Washington outlined a proposal to amend tech export rules that could restrict TSMC’s sales to China’s Huawei. A U.S. Commerce Department official said TSMC’s decision to locate the plant in the United States generated “good will” at the department, the drafter of the law that would require TSMC and others to get U.S. licences to sell chips to Huawei. The move shows the delicate balancing act by TSMC to stay on side with Washington, which has stepped up criticism of Chinese trade practices and Beijing’s handling of the novel coronavirus, while protecting its China business, analysts said. “TSMC has to figure out how to best leverage and benefit from the U.S.-China tensions,” said Liu Pei-chen, tech analyst at government-backed think tank Taiwan Institute of Economic Research. It could not escape them so its room for manoeuvre consisted of negotiating the best terms for the U.S. factory it could, she said. Analysts estimate TSMC generates around 60% of its revenue from the United States and some 20% from China. Liu said TSMC would enjoy the first-mover advantage as U.S. President Donald Trump seeks to wrestle global tech supply chains back from China ahead of Nov. 3 presidential election. U.S. government officials were not immediately available to comment on whether the investment would make it more likely that TSMC would get a licence to supply Huawei. TSMC said it was working with outside counsels to interpret the rules in good time and maintains long-term collaborations with equipment partners around the world. Huawei did not immediately reply to a request for comment. The Trump administration on Friday moved to block shipments of semiconductors to Huawei from global chipmakers, in an action that could ramp up tensions with China. The proposed export rule amendment requires foreign companies that use U.S. chipmaking equipment to obtain a U.S. license before supplying certain chips to Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL], or an affiliate like HiSilicon. Semiconductors play a key role in both consumer electronics and defense equipment. The vast majority of the most advanced chips are made in Asia, which has caused concern among U.S. officials as a strategic rivalry with China deepens. “Building a fab (production line) in the U.S. starting with 5 nanometre technology is not the cheapest option for TSMC, but it would help address fears of U.S. IPs and technologies theft. TSMC may continue its operations in China to serve domestic and other clients.” Citi analysts said in a note. With a small production plan that would contribute just 3-4% of its total output, the new U.S. plant may hit TSMC’s margins, but the splurge underscores the extent TSMC is willing to spend to protect its customer base in its two biggest markets. “The scale & technology is similar to what TSMC did in China, suggesting a balance between the U.S. & China,” said Bernstein analysts, noting it took 7 years for TSMC’s Shanghai fab to break even in operating profit level and 2-3 years for its Nanjing plant. While huge in terms of foreign investment in the United States, the plan is small by TSMC’s standards, and the company carefully planned to spend it over 9 years, leaving enough room to make downward adjustments depending on market situations. Its compatriot Foxconn pledged a $10 billion investment in Wisconsin and to create 13,000 jobs in 2017 when Trump became President, but it has not met early hiring targets and has said it has been reconsidering its plans. “Considering the state of Foxconn’s construction in the U.S., as well as the U.S. election this year, it’s not impossible that these plans for building the fab could change,” said Gu Wenjun, chief analyst at Shanghai-based consultancy ICWise. Foxconn was not immediately available for comment. While U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said chips from the new plant will power everything from artificial intelligence to 5G base stations to fighter jets, some analysts said 5 nanometre chips from the plant will no longer be the most advanced technology by 2024 when it begins production. “This is more of a political response from TSMC to the US government’s demands,” Gu said. TSMC said the plant was a business decision. “Our intention to build and operate the fab in the U.S. is a business decision, to address the best interests of our customers,” it told Reuters. Some analysts also said the plant was too small to be economically efficient and the size of U.S. incentive and price from customers who prefer U.S. production would likely decide its profitability. Yet the announcement is unlikely to be welcomed by Beijing who would see it as Washington’s attempt to control more of a crucial supplier to its national tech champion Huawei, and only spur its ambition to build its own chip supply chains. “I think it would be foolish for China to punish Taiwan or TSMC, given so many of its own companies still rely on it,” said Stewart Randall who tracks the chip sector at Shanghai-based consultancy Intralink. “Huawei will continue using TSMC for all high-end chips and China will continue investing in local companies to be self-reliant at some point.” China’s state-controlled Global Times reported on Friday, citing a source close to the government, that China was ready to take a series of countermeasures against the U.S. plan to block shipments of chips to Huawei. Authorities in Beijing could not be immediately reached after hours for comment."
58.62688213093373," Taiwan's TSMC to build Arizona chip plant as U.S.-China tech rivalry escalates (Reuters) - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd 2330.TW, the biggest contract chipmaker, said it plans to build a $12 billion factory in Arizona in an apparent win for the Trump administration's efforts to wrestle global tech supply chains back from China. The plan, which will create over 1,600 jobs, comes as U.S. President Donald Trump steps up criticism of Chinese trade practices and Beijing’s handling of the novel coronavirus ahead of the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election. Trump has long pledged to bring manufacturing back from overseas and now a steep economic slump brought on by the coronavirus is driving a government-wide push to end U.S. production and supply chain dependency on China. U.S. Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross touted the deal as “another indication that President Trump’s policy agenda has led to a renaissance in American manufacturing.” TSMC is a major supplier to U.S. tech giants such as Apple Inc AAPL.O and Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O, as well as Chinese firms like Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL], which Washington has put on a trade blacklist. “This project is of critical, strategic importance to a vibrant and competitive U.S. semiconductor ecosystem that enables leading U.S. companies to fabricate their cutting-edge semiconductor products within the United States,” TSMC said. While huge in terms of foreign investment in the United States, the plan is small by TSMC’s standards. For 2020, TSMC’s capex plan is $15-$16 billion. The Taiwanese chipmaker said the plan was to build the plant over nine years. “The budget... suggests the eventual scale won’t be big,” Bernstein analysts said in a note, adding revenue contribution from the plant will stay at around 3%-4%. “The scale and technology is similar to what TSMC did in China, suggesting a balance between the US & China.” A U.S. Commerce Department official said TSMC’s decision to locate the plant in the United States generated “good will” at the department, the drafter of a law that would, if implemented, severely restrict TSMC chip sales to Huawei. Credit Suisse analysts said proposed restrictions could threaten TSMC’s 14% of sales from Huawei, escalate U.S.-China tensions and delay the rollout of the next-generation 5G mobile network. “While it is hard to be certain, we believe that TSMC announcing a U.S. Fab could remove the threat of further Huawei restrictions in the very near-term at least,” JP Morgan analysts said in a note. Shares of TSMC, the world's most valuable semiconductor company with a market capitalisation of about $255 billion, exceeding Intel Corp's INTC.O, closed up 1.7% on Friday, outperforming a 0.3% gain in the main Taiwan stock market .TWII. The plant, the biggest foreign investment by TSMC, will produce the most sophisticated 5 nanometer chips, which can be used in high-end defense and communications devices. TSMC manufactures the bulk of its chips in Taiwan and has older chip facilities in China and Washington state. Its chips power Apple’s iPhones and the iPhone maker works closely with TSMC to become the first to take advantage of new advances in its chip-making processes. U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said chips from the new TSMC plant will power everything from artificial intelligence to 5G base stations to F-35 fighter jets. Semiconductors play a key role in both consumer electronics and defense equipment. The vast majority of the most advanced chips are made in Asia, which has caused concern among U.S. officials as a strategic rivalry with China deepens over the origins of the deadly coronavirus. While Intel has major manufacturing operations in the United States, it supplies only its own chips rather than making them for outside customers. The Trump administration has been in talks with both Intel and TSMC to build a plant in the United States, and Intel said last week it was in discussions with the Department of Defense about improving domestic sources for microelectronics and related technology. The TSMC announcement is not expected to derail the Pentagon’s efforts to bolster the supply chain for microprocessors, despite the Commerce Department’s working on the TSMC deal independently, a person familiar with the matter said. Apple and Intel declined to comment. TSMC said that construction of the Arizona facility would begin in 2021 with production targeted to begin in 2024, and that it would be able to process up to 20,000 silicon wafers per month. Each wafer can contain thousands of individual chips. The investment will be made from 2021 to 2029. The Wall Street Journal first reported the latest details of TSMC’s plans."

28.030185925501033," Huawei chip unit orders up more domestic production as U.S. restrictions loom: sources SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Huawei Technologies Co Ltd is gradually shifting production of chips designed in-house away from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) and towards a mainland Chinese firm in preparation for more U.S. restrictions, sources familiar with the matter said. The move towards Shanghai-based Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC) comes as Washington readies new rules which would require foreign companies using U.S. chipmaking equipment to obtain a license before supplying chips to Huawei - rules that would directly affect TSMC. It also highlights how U.S. restrictions against Huawei can act as an impetus for Chinese companies to accelerate the development of homegrown technology. The U.S. government alleges Huawei, the world’s biggest maker of telecom network equipment and a major smartphone manufacturer, is a national security risk as its equipment could be used by Beijing to spy, and has barred U.S. firms from selling to the Chinese firm without a licence. Huawei has repeatedly denied its products pose a security threat. Huawei’s chip unit, HiSilicon, began to direct some of its engineers towards designing for SMIC rather than TSMC in late 2019, said one of the sources, who was not authorised to speak to the media and declined to be identified. “Before, Huawei wanted to work with top notch manufacturers, and SMIC was just second-tier,” the person said. “We are now moving resources to SMIC to speed up our help to them.” A Huawei spokesman called the shift “common industry practice” in a statement to Reuters. “Huawei considers carefully issues such as capacity, technology and delivery when choosing semiconductor fabrication plants,” it said. TSMC, the world’s top contract manufacturer of semiconductors, said it does not comment on individual customers. SMIC declined to comment. It was not immediately clear how much more production is being outsourced to SMIC. Huawei has also said it would look at South Korean firms, other Taiwanese and mainland Chinese firms as alternative sources for chips. While SMIC is seen as the strongest mainland China alternative to TSMC, it remains well behind TSMC in its technological expertise and U.S. authorities have already taken measures to prevent it from acquiring the most advanced chip-making equipment. TSMC does not reveal how much revenue each customer provides but analysts estimate that by late 2019 Huawei accounted for 13% to 15% of TSMC’s sales. Chip production that could be shifted to SMIC likely only accounts for 1 to 3 percentage points of that, they said. “Right now, there’s a still sizeable gap between TSMC and SMIC in terms of skills, stability, and reliability,” said Gu Wenjun, senior analyst at Shanghai-based consultancy ICWise. TSMC, for example, is currently perfecting its 5 nanometre process node technology. SMIC recently introduced 14nm technology in late 2019, which TSMC rolled out officially years earlier. Experts say HiSilicon’s latest Kirin processors, used exclusively in Huawei mobile phones, can only be made by TSMC at the moment, although they add that earlier Kirin processors could be outsourced to SMIC. Other chips produced by HiSilicon, such as those for so-called IOT devices, power management, or set-top boxes, could be sent to SMIC, they said. Gaining more business from Huawei would also help SMIC improve its processes as Huawei would be able to pass on valuable knowledge gained in working with TSMC, the analysts added."
28.030185925501033," TSMC Q1 profit almost doubles but trims full-year revenue estimate on pandemic TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) 2330.TW reported a near doubling in TSM.N first-quarter net profit but trimmed its full-year revenue outlook as weakening demand caused by the coronavirus offsets strong sales for faster chips. The world's largest contract chipmaker, whose clients include tech companies such as iPhone maker Apple Inc AAPL.O, said profit in the January-to-March period was T$116.987 billion ($3.89 billion), up 90.6% from a year earlier, It was the company’s strongest quarterly profit growth in nearly 10 years and much higher than the T$105.83 billion forecast on average by 19 analysts, Refinitiv Eikon data showed. The impact from the coronavirus outbreak however prompted TSMC to trim its 2020 revenue growth target to a “mid- to high-teens” percentage versus a previous forecast of nearly 20%. “Our second-half revenue is about flattish or may decline slightly,” Chief Financial Officer Wendell Huang told an earnings briefing on Thursday, citing what the company saw as a “temporary” impact on demand from the virus, which TSMC expects to be stabilised by June. Huang said the coronavirus was expected to hit demand for electronics, including smartphones, but it would be balanced by continued fifth generation (5G) mobile communication technology deployment and strong demand for faster chips. TSMC said consumer electronics demand was “much softer than expected” due to the virus, and that it expected global smartphone shipments - which accounted for nearly half of its revenue in the first quarter - to decline by a “high single-digit” percentage this year. TSMC expected second-quarter revenue of $10.1-$10.4 billion, up from $7.75 billion a year ago. Buoyed by demand for advanced chips from clients investing in 5G technology and artificial intelligence, TSMC’s revenue in the first quarter rose 45.2% to $10.31 billion, versus its forecast range of $10.2 billion to $10.3 billion. The earnings growth may, however, only be a short reprieve as coronavirus-induced job losses and other economic pain hurt global demand for consumer electronics and major clients grapple with supply chain disruptions and factory shutdowns. Gartner last week slashed its forecast for global semiconductor revenue in 2020 to a decline of 0.9% from its previous estimate of 12.5% growth. TSMC gave a more bearish view, saying it expected the global market for foundry chipmaking - contract chip manufacturing - to grow by a high single-digit to low teens percentage this year - lowering a previous forecast of 17% growth. The company said the global semiconductor market could decline slightly this year, having previously forecast 8% growth. Apple, a major TSMC client, rescinded its outlook for the first quarter of 2020 saying manufacturing in China had taken longer than expected to resume amid travel restrictions and an extended Lunar New Year break. Responding to reports that the United States has been pressuring TSMC to build a foundry there to protect its chips from perceived Chinese interference, TSMC said it was “actively reviewing” such a plan, adding that cost, supply chain readiness and talent remained the main issues to address. Shares in TSMC were down 0.4% before the results. They have fallen more than 13% this year. ($1 = 30.0890 Taiwan dollars)"

-6.795820678492724," U.S. mulls cutting Huawei off from global chip suppliers, with TSMC in crosshairs WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration is considering changing U.S. regulations to allow it to block shipments of chips to Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL] from companies such as Taiwan's TSMC 2330.TW, the world's largest contract chipmaker, two sources familiar with the matter said. New restrictions on commerce with China’s Huawei are among several options to be considered at high-level U.S. meetings this week and next. The chip proposal has been drafted but its approval is far from certain, one of the sources said. The measure would be a blow to the world's no. 2 smartphone maker as well as to TSMC, a major producer of chips for Huawei's HiSilicon unit and mobile phone rivals Apple Inc AAPL.O and Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O. “What they’re trying to do is make sure that no chips go to Huawei that they can possibly control,” the second source said. Huawei is at the heart of a battle for global technological dominance between the United States and China. The United States is trying to convince allies to exclude its gear from next generation 5G networks on grounds its equipment could be used by China for spying. Huawei has repeatedly denied the claim. To target global chip sales to Huawei, U.S. authorities would alter the Foreign Direct Product Rule, which subjects some foreign-made goods based on U.S. technology or software to U.S. regulations. Reuters reported possible changes to that rule in November. Under the draft proposal, the U.S. government would force foreign companies that use U.S. chipmaking equipment to seek a U.S. license before supplying Huawei - a major expansion of export control authority that could anger U.S. allies worldwide. The U.S. Commerce Department declined to comment on the proposal. But a Commerce spokesman said recent U.S. charges against Huawei, including conspiring to steal trade secrets, “reaffirm the need for caution in considering license applications. The U.S. continues to have major concerns about Huawei.” Huawei did not respond to requests for comment. A spokeswoman for TSMC said the company does not answer “hypothetical” questions and does not comment on individual customers. The United States placed Huawei on a blacklist in May last year, citing national security concerns. That forced some U.S. and foreign companies to seek special licenses from the Commerce Department to sell to it, but China hawks in the U.S. government have been frustrated by the vast number of supply chains beyond their reach. Others in the Trump administration fear antagonizing Beijing, which just signed a trade deal with Washington. They also worry the restrictions will drive innovation offshore and benefit foreign rivals. Most chip manufacturers rely on equipment produced by U.S. companies like KLA KLAC.O, Lam Research LRCX.O and Applied Materials AMAT.O, according to a report last year from China's Everbright Securities. “There is no production line in China that uses only equipment made in China, so it is very difficult to make any chipsets without U.S. equipment,” Everbright wrote. Shares of KLA and Lam fell around 4 percent in U.S. trading on Tuesday."
-6.795820678492724," Exclusive: Samsung wins 5-nanometer modem chip contract from Qualcomm - sources SAN FRANCISCO/SEOUL (Reuters) - Samsung Electronics Co Ltd's 005930.KS semiconductor manufacturing division has won a contract to make new Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O 5G chips using its most advanced chip-making technology, two sources familiar with the matter said, boosting the Korean firm's efforts to gain market share against rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co 5425.TWO. Samsung will fabricate at least some of Qualcomm’s X60 modem chips, which will connect devices such as smart phones to 5G wireless data networks. The X60 will be made on Samsung’s 5-nanometer process, the sources said, which makes the chips smaller and more power-efficient than previous generations. One of the sources said TSMC is also expected to fabricate 5-nanometer modems for Qualcomm. Samsung and Qualcomm declined to comment, and TSMC did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Best known among consumers for its phones and other electronic devices, Samsung is the world's second-biggest chip manufacturer through its foundry division, self-supplying many of its own mobile phone parts and also fabricating chips for outside customers such as International Business Machines Corp IBM.N and Nvidia Corp NVDA.O, among others. But much of Samsung’s semiconductor revenue historically has come from memory chips, whose prices can swing wildly as supply and demand fluctuate. In an attempt to cut its reliance on that volatile market, Samsung announced a plan last year to invest $116 billion in non-memory chips through 2030. The Qualcomm deal shows progress in winning customers to that effort. Even if Samsung has won only part of the orders, Qualcomm represents a flagship customer for Samsung’s 5-nanometer manufacturing technology. Samsung plans to ramp up that technology this year in an attempt to regain market share against TSMC, which is also starting mass production of 5-nanonmeter chips this year. The Qualcomm win could boost Samsung’s foundry business because the X60 modem is likely to be used in many mobile devices as they shift to 5G. In the fourth quarter of 2019, Samsung had 17.8% market share versus TSMC’s 52.7%, according to data from TrendForce. In a separate announcement, Qualcomm said on Tuesday it would begin sending samples of the X60 chips to customers in the first quarter of this year. Qualcomm did not disclose who would manufacture the chips, and Reuters could not learn whether the first batches of chips would be made by Samsung or TSMC. The Taiwanese company was faster to ramp up high-volume production of chips using the previous 7-nanometer manufacturing process, winning customers such as Apple Inc AAPL.O. Last month, TSMC executives said they expect to begin ramping up 5-nanometer production in the first half of the year and expect it to make up 10% of the company’s revenue for 2020. Asked during a January investor conference call how Samsung will compete with TSMC, Shawn Han, senior vice president at Samsung Foundry, said the company planned to expand 5-nanometer mass production by “diversifying customer applications” this year. Qualcomm designs its own chips but works with outside companies to manufacture them. It has used manufacturing services from both Samsung and TSMC in the past, as well as from China's Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp 0981.HK, depending on which foundry's technology and pricing met its needs for the product at hand."
-6.795820678492724," U.S. mulls cutting Huawei off from global chip suppliers, with TSMC in crosshairs WASHINGTON, Feb 17 (Reuters) - The Trump administration is considering changing U.S. regulations to allow it to block shipments of chips to Huawei Technologies from companies such as Taiwan’s TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker, two sources familiar with the matter said. New restrictions on commerce with China’s Huawei are among several options to be considered at high-level U.S. meetings this week and next. The chip proposal has been drafted but its approval is far from certain, one of the sources said.

-9.962304389363519," Taiwan's TSMC forecasts sharp rise in first quarter revenue, bets on robust 5G demand TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) forecast an up to 45% spike in January-March revenue and raised its capex plan for the year, betting robust demand for 5G smartphones would dial up profits at the world’s top contract chipmaker. The promising outlook from TSMC - a proxy for global tech demand given it has clients like Apple, Qualcomm and Huawei [HWT.UL] - comes as a strong uptake of 5G smartphones is fuelling an overall recovery in the global smartphone market that has shrunk for the past three years. TSMC said it expects revenue over January-March to reach $10.2 billion-$10.3 billion, versus $7.1 billion a year ago. “Moving into first quarter 2020, despite mobile product seasonality, we anticipate our business to be supported by the continued ramp up of 5G smartphones,” Chief Financial Officer Wendell Huang said at a briefing on Thursday, after TSMC earlier reported a better-than-expected profit for the fourth quarter. However, the outlook assumes no disruption caused by the China-U.S. trade war. The world’s two largest economies signed an initial trade deal on Wednesday, but with numerous thorny issues still unresolved. The United States has in particular pressured Huawei, believing it a potential security threat, despite the Chinese company’s repeated denials. “The company sees any disruption will be short-lived and for example commented that smaller telco infrastructure suppliers can quickly pick up the shortfall if Huawei can’t deploy 5G as planned,” analysts at Bernstein wrote in a note. “We find that too optimistic and believe the short-term impact will be notable.” TSMC’s October-December net profit rose 16.1% year-on-year to T$116.035 billion ($3.88 billion), above an average forecast of T$111.41 billion drawn from 19 analysts by Refinitiv. Revenue rose 10.6% to $10.39 billion, versus the company’s estimate of $10.2 billion to $10.3 billion and an average $10.55 billion estimate from 21 analysts. “Our fourth-quarter business benefited from strong demand for high-end smartphones, initial 5G deployment and high performance computing related applications using TSMC’s industry-leading 7-nanometer technology,” Huang said. The 7-nanometer is one of the most advanced technology TSMC uses for its high-end semiconductors. TSMC expects the global market for foundry chipmaking - contract chip manufacturing - to grow 17% this year, outstripping an 8% rise in the semiconductor market worldwide. It raised its estimate for capital expenditure to $15-16 billion for 2020, versus an earlier forecast of a level similar to its estimated capex for 2019, which was $14-15 billion. In the end it spent $14.9 billion in 2019. The higher capex allocation comes amid forecasts for rising smartphone demand. Industry tracker IDC sees global smartphone shipments topping 1.4 billion units in 2020, up 1.5% on year, which should bode well for chipmaker TSMC. Reflecting growing optimism for the tech sector, TSMC shares hit a record high this month after gaining more than 50% in 2019. Investor sentiment should get a further boost from a Phase 1 trade deal agreed this week between the United States and China that is expected to defuse their 18-month trade war, which has weighed on the global economy and the tech industry. “Looking into 2020-21, we believe TSMC’s position in advanced technology nodes remains solid given its greater capacity, yield rate control, execution and diversified customer base,” KGI analyst Laura Chen wrote in a January report prior to the earnings announcement. Japan’s Nikkei reported this week that the United States had increased pressure on TSMC to make military-use chips there, free from any potential Chinese interference. China claims Taiwan as its own territory. TSMC declined to comment on the report, reiterating that the company is always evaluating the idea of making chips everywhere. Company chairman Mark Liu said a decision will be made based on the “best interest” of their clients. “We listen to our customers as our priority,” he said. “In the future, right now, it’s too early to say. Our customers prefer us to have the lowest (cost) production site in doing business with us.” To overcome geopolitical changes, TSMC will continue to be the industry’s leader so that “people will have to come to you”, he added. “That’s how we maintain being everyone’s foundry.” Shares in TSMC closed down 1.62%, versus a 0.21% fall in the wider market, valuing the company at almost $295 billion, bigger than U.S. rival Intel Corp’s $256 billion. It reported results after the market closed."
-9.962304389363519," Breakingviews - Consumer wallets are top risk to chip titan TSMC HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - Chip titan TSMC looks immune to trade and supply chain disruptions, but not to consumer wallets. A heady valuation multiple for Taiwan’s $295 billion supplier to Apple, Huawei and others reflects its relentless march on rivals in developing cutting-edge semiconductors. Rising retail prices for ever-fancier smartphones, though, may soon spoil the party. After shrinking for three consecutive years, the smartphone market is finally on track to grow this year. That’s largely thanks to 5G-powered models, which promise mobile data speeds as much as 100 times faster than the current wireless technology. Industry tracker IDC reckons smartphone shipments worldwide will top 1.4 billion units by the end of the year, up 1.5%. Of that, 5G handsets will account for some 14%. That bodes well for the world’s top contract-chipmaker, which research firm TrendForce reckons dominates with over half the market. The company, formally known as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, is at the forefront of making semiconductors used in smartphones, personal computers, and even crypto-currency mining machines. TSMC’s lead over rival chipmakers - South Korea’s Samsung Electronics and U.S.-based Intel – is considerable and the Taiwanese company’s customers are probably wary that it does not gain too much pricing power. Still, it means the outfit is less vulnerable to customers moving production or shifting supply chains to avoid tariffs and security concerns. Expectations are high. TSMC, which will report fourth quarter results on Thursday and provide guidance for the three months to March, is forecast to deliver some T$430 billion, or $14.4 billion, of net profit this year, a 26% rise, according to analyst forecasts on Refinitiv. After rocketing nearly 60% over the past year, the company’s shares now trade at over 20 times forward earnings, well above their five-year average of 14.5. The biggest risk for this seemingly unstoppable giant is perhaps any waning desire of consumers to pay increasingly large sums out of their disposable income for handheld devices. Smartphone users, for instance, may not want to fork out some $1000, the latest price tag of Samsung’s Galaxy Note 5G model in the United States, on the latest model. For TSMC, that’s not the worst problem to have."

18.57131248402829," Chipmaker TSMC boosts capex by up to $5 billion, sees fourth-quarter sales jump on smartphones TAIPEI (Reuters) - Apple Inc supplier TSMC raised its 2019 capital spending plan by up to $5 billion on Thursday and forecast a nearly 10% rise in fourth-quarter revenue on strong demand for faster mobile chips and new high-end smartphones. The bullish forecast by the world’s top contract chipmaker should ease investor fears of a global tech slowdown, as the world economic growth outlook has dimmed largely due to a 15-month trade war between the United States and China. “5G smartphone growth momentum is stronger than we expected... We have good reasons to increase our capex this year and next year,” TSMC CEO C.C. Wei told an earnings briefing after reporting the Taiwanese company’s strongest quarterly profit growth in more than two years. Wei said TSMC almost doubled its forecast for fifth-generation (5G) smartphone penetration for 2020 to mid-teen percent from a forecast of single digit made just six months ago. Smartphone makers including Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd are racing to develop phones enabled with the 5G technology, which could be up to 100 times faster than current 4G networks. TSMC, formally Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd, whose clients also include Qualcomm Inc and Huawei, raised its 2019 capex to a record $14 billion-$15 billion on Thursday from an earlier forecast of $10 billion-$11 billion. It expected fourth-quarter revenue of between $10.2 billion and $10.3 billion, up from $9.4 billion a year ago, and gross margin at 48%-50% versus 47.7% in the same period a year ago. TSMC reported a 13.5% rise in third quarter net profit to T$101.07 billion ($3.30 billion), its strongest growth since the first quarter of 2017, thanks to strong sales to smartphone makers. The profit figure compared with a T$96.33 billion average forecast drawn from 20 analysts, according to Refinitiv data. Revenue rose 10.7% to $9.4 billion, compared with the company’s own estimate of $9.1 billion to $9.2 billion. Sales earned from smartphone makers accounted for 49% of its total revenue, up from 45% from a year ago, while China sales amounted to 20%, up from 15%, making up for modest slowdown in every other major region including North America. TSMC shares closed down 1% on Thursday prior to the earnings announcement. They have risen 28% so far this year, giving it a market value of $251.3 billion, bigger than U.S. rival Intel Corp’s $232 billion. The Taiwan company’s strong results come after Huawei, the world’s No.2 smartphone maker, said on Wednesday it has shipped 185 million smartphones in the first nine months of the year. That implies a 29% surge in Huawei’s third-quarter shipments, as it benefited from promotions and patriotic purchases in China that more than offset weak international sales on U.S. trade sanctions. New smartphone launches ahead of the year-end shopping season, as well as rising demand for new technologies such as 5G and artificial intelligence will continue to drive sales for TSMC’s high-performance chips, known as 7nm, analysts said."

14.922099281265472," TSMC expects 5G to drive earnings, flags South Korea-Japan spat as risk TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan’s TSMC forecast that robust demand for 5G chips will drive a stronger second-half even as it anticipates a dispute between Japan and South Korea involving chip-making materials to be a big source of uncertainty. The world’s largest contract chipmaker and supplier to Apple Inc reported on Thursday a decline in second-quarter profit. But it said demand is likely to recover during the rest of 2019, particularly from smartphone makers, hampered at present by the impact of a Sino-U.S. trade war. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) forecast third-quarter revenue to rise as much as 8.4% from a year earlier in U.S. dollar terms. “Although our business continues to be impacted by a global slowing economy ... we have also passed the bottom of the cycle of our business and again began to see demand increasing,” Chief Executive Officer and Vice Chairman C.C. Wei told analysts during an earnings briefing. TSMC, which makes modem chips for U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm Inc, is expected to see early gains from the shift to 5G as smartphone makers including Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Huawei [HWT.UL] race to develop phones enabled with that technology. 5G is a network technology for wireless communications that could be up to 100 times faster than current 4G networks, and modem chips connect devices like phones to these networks. Apple is also likely to turn to Qualcomm for 5G chips after its sole chip supplier Intel said in April it would exit the modem chip business. Apple, though, is not expected to launch a 5G iPhone until September 2020. “For 5G, if you look at next year, the biggest influencer should be smartphone, and secondly high performance computing, which includes both networking and infrastructure,” said Wei, adding that demand for 5G chips from auto makers would also help. The spread of 5G networks helped Dutch semiconductor equipment maker ASML Holding NV, a supplier to TSMC, beat analysts’ second-quarter earnings estimates on Wednesday. Even so, analysts were cautious on TSMC’s outlook, citing a slower-than-expected introduction of 5G technology and still-tepid demand for smartphones. “With a still-slow demand recovery and excessive inventory, we think wafer orders from fabless companies might remain weak,” Fubon Securities analyst Sherman Shang wrote in a research note prior to TSMC’s earnings announcement, referring to chipmaking factories known as fabs. Taiwan’s supply chain manufacturers have been navigating slowing global demand for smartphones as well as market disruption stemming from tit-for-tat import tariffs between China and the United States. Adding to risk factors, Japan last week tightened curbs on exports of high-tech materials used in smartphone displays and chips to South Korea, home to the world’s biggest memory chip makers, Samsung and SK Hynix Inc. Chairman Mark Liu said the dispute is a major uncertainty for the coming months as it is likely to impact technology supply chains, as Japan dominates the market for the materials in question. Earlier, TSMC reported a 7.6% decline in April-June net profit at T$66.77 billion ($2.15 billion), just ahead of analyst estimates. Revenue rose 3.3% to T$241 billion, but fell 1.4% to $7.75 billion in U.S. dollar terms - still topping the average of 23 analyst estimates compiled by Refinitiv. Prior to TSMC’s announcement, its shares closed up 0.8% versus a 0.25% fall in the wider market. Shares in the company - which has a market value of about $210 billion and trails just Samsung and Intel by that measure among chip- and chip-equipment makers - have risen around 13% so far this year."

Business in the third quarter will be driven by increased demand for fifth-generation telecommunications (5G) equipment as well as for smartphones spurred by new product launches, and the fourth quarter will be even stronger, Wei said. TSMC forecast a gross profit margin of 46% to 48% for the third quarter, and an operating margin of 35% to 37%, compared with 47.4% and 36.6%, respectively, a year earlier. The chipmaker also said it expected annual capital expenditure for the year to exceed the high end of its earlier forecast of $10 billion to $11 billion due to strong 5G demand. Even so, analysts were cautious on TSMC’s growth outlook for the coming months, citing a slower-than-expected introduction of 5G technology and still-tepid demand for smartphones, which they said accounted for nearly half of its first-quarter sales. “With a still-slow demand recovery and excessive inventory, we think wafer orders from fabless companies might remain weak,” Fubon Securities analyst Sherman Shang wrote in a research note prior to TSMC’s earnings announcement. TSMC’s short-term downside, however, could be supported by “major customers’ recovery in 2020 from a very low base in 2019, such as Apple,” Shang wrote. Indicating evolving market conditions, the spread of accelerating spread of 5G networks helped Dutch semiconductor equipment maker ASML Holding NV, a supplier to TSMC, beat analysts’ second-quarter earnings estimates on Wednesday.

17.40686609058049," Huawei denies report that orders to key suppliers cut after U.S. blacklisting (Reuters) - Huawei Technologies Co Ltd has cut or canceled orders to major suppliers of components for its smartphones and telecom equipment following its U.S. blacklisting, the Nikkei reported, claims that were rejected by the Chinese firm. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC) confirmed that orders from Huawei have declined after U.S. President Donald Trump imposed a ban on the Chinese company on national security grounds, according to the report. Huawei has also downgraded its forecast for total smartphone shipments in the second half of 2019 by “about 20% to 30%” from the previous estimate, the Nikkei reported, citing sources familiar with the matter. “Our global production levels are normal, with no notable adjustments in either direction,” a Huawei spokesman told Reuters on Thursday, adding there was “no change” to its smartphone sales target. TSMC did not respond to a request for comment on the report. But it said at its annual general meeting on Wednesday that Washington’s move to ban U.S. companies from doing business with Huawei would have a short-term impact on the company, although it was upbeat on the outlook for this year. The Trump administration in May added Huawei to a trade blacklist. The move put Huawei and 68 affiliates in more than two dozen countries on the Commerce Department’s so-called Entity List, a move that bans the company from buying parts and components from American firms without U.S. government approval. Ever since, global tech companies have been cutting ties with the Chinese telecom giant and complying with the U.S. ban. Alphabet Inc’s Google has suspended the transfer of some hardware, software and technical services to Huawei. Optical components maker Lumentum Holdings Inc ceased all its shipments to Huawei, while U.S. chipmaker Qorvo Inc said it expects first-quarter revenue to take a $50 million hit due to a halt in shipments to the Chinese company. Huawei is allowed to buy U.S. goods until Aug. 19 to maintain existing telecoms networks and provide software updates to its smartphones."

-1.7746781859558303," TSMC upbeat on chip outlook after Apple-Qualcomm settlement; first quarter disappoints TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan’s TSMC struck an upbeat note about the outlook for the depressed global chip market, betting that a rollout of faster 5G mobile network would buoy demand, even as it posted its steepest quarterly profit drop in more than seven years. TSMC, the world’s biggest contract chipmaker, said a recent settlement between its top clients Apple and Qualcomm to end their two-year legal dispute over smartphone chips will help the Taiwanese firm. “The settlement will bring forward 5G adoption; this will definitely benefit TSMC,” Elizabeth Sun, a senior director at TSMC told reporters on Thursday. The upbeat forecast echoes that from its supplier ASML, which reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday and said it expects growth to accelerate thanks to demand from Chinese chipmakers. “While the economic factor and mobile product seasonality are still lingering as we move into second quarter, we believe we may have passed the bottom of the cycle of our business as we are seeing demand stabilizing,” TSMC CFO Lora Ho said. TSMC, a proxy for technology demand as its clients include iPhone maker Apple, Qualcomm and Huawei Technologies, posted a 32 percent drop in its net profit to T$61.4 billion ($2 billion) for January-March. That marked the steepest fall since the third quarter of 2011 and also lagged the T$64.3 billion average of 21 analyst estimates compiled by Refinitiv. Slowing global demand for smartphones, as well as concerns over the prolonged U.S.-China trade war, has taken a toll on Taiwan’s supply chain manufacturers. TSMC, formally Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd, forecast second-quarter revenue of $7.55 billion to $7.65 billion. That would be 2.5-3.8 percent lower than the year ago, but better than a steep 16 percent drop in the first quarter. A defective chemical that disrupted part of its production in February weighed on its first-quarter revenue, TSMC added. The company also forecast gross margin of 43 percent to 45 percent in the second quarter, and operating margin of 31-33 percent, compared with 47.8 percent and 36.2 percent a year earlier, respectively. The forecast comes as investors fret about a global tech slowdown after rivals including Samsung Electronics Co Ltd recently flagged weak demand. Analysts said TSMC would gradually recover from sluggish smartphone sales in coming months and new demand including for devices equipped with 5G communications technology could help keep full-year revenue at least broadly flat. “Fortunately 5G should put TSMC back to growth and help it deliver double-digit earnings per share expansion in 2020 and 2021,” Mark Li, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, wrote in a research note prior to the earnings announcement. Analysts also said TSMC could benefit from Chinese clients stocking up on semiconductor products in case of any adverse outcome from the U.S.-China trade negotiations.

The downbeat forecast by TSMC, a proxy for global tech demand as its clients include Apple Inc, Qualcomm and Huawei Technologies [HWT.UL], bodes ill for its peers and suppliers such as Intel Corp, Nvidia and ASML which are set to report results in coming weeks. Shares of European chipmakers tumbled on Thursday after TSMC’s revenue guidance, with Siltronic falling 6 percent and STMicroelectronics down 3 percent. Investors are already fretting about a global tech slowdown after warnings from Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Apple, which earlier this month cut its quarterly sales forecast due to poor iPhone demand in China. TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker, said a sudden drop in sales of high-end smartphones has caused an inventory build-up, and weak demand will continue to weigh on it until new smartphone launches in the second half. “The inventory in the supply chain is quite a lot”, which may lead to a drop in the first half of 2019 for the smartphone business, Chairman Mark Liu said at a post-earnings conference. It forecast first-quarter revenue of $7.3 billion to $7.4 billion. The nearly 14 percent drop would be the steepest decline since the March 2009 quarter, according to Refinitiv data, when revenue tumbled 54 percent in Taiwan dollar terms. For the whole of 2019, TSMC expects revenue growth to more than halve to 1-3 percent from last year’s 6.5 percent. It announced plans to slash investment. “Due to the macro economic outlook in 2019, we are tightening this year’s capital spending by several hundred million dollars to a level of between $10-$11 billion,” Chief Financial Officer Lora Ho said. Market research firm Canalys estimates that smartphone shipments fell 12 percent last year in China, the world’s biggest smartphone market, and expects shipments there to shrink another 3 percent this year to below 400 million for the first time since 2014. TSMC posted a meager 0.7 percent rise in fourth-quarter net profit to T$99.98 billion ($3.24 billion), roughly in line with analysts’ estimates, according to I/B/E/S estimates from Refinitiv. Revenue rose 2 percent to $9.40 billion in the December quarter, also in line with the analysts’ estimates.

-16.644038184916273," Smartphone slowdown tests new leadership at Taiwan's chip champion HSINCHU, Taiwan (Reuters) - In late August, the new chairman of chip-making titan Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co 2330.TW, Mark Liu, got the sort of news that would make any boss smile: his biggest competitor was throwing in the towel. Just under three months into Liu’s tenure, rival GlobalFoundries had announced that it would not compete in the latest generation of chip-making technology. It was a reminder of just how dominant TSMC has become in manufacturing chips for other companies, a business it all but invented. TSMC stock quickly hit an all-time high. But Liu’s job seems likely to get tougher, not easier. In an interview at the company’s newly christened Morris Chang headquarters building, named after its founder, Liu said global politics were his biggest worry. “The worst you can imagine can be very bad,” Liu said, referring to geopolitical developments such as the U.S.-China trade war and tensions between Taiwan and the mainland. The thoughtful, soft-spoken engineer took over from the ebullient and outspoken Chang at a tricky time. Emerging competition from China casts an ominous shadow, and the intricate network of relationships that have enabled TSMC and its brethren in the global technology supply chain to thrive are under threat amid the trade dispute. Worse, global smartphone sales have flattened. Purchases of smartphone chips by the likes of Apple Inc AAPL.O and Qualcomm QCOM.O have powered TSMC for a decade. But Liu remains optimistic about that business. “Smartphone units have plateaued, but the silicon content of each smartphone on average is still increasing,” he said, projecting growth in the high single digits over the next couple of years. He said smartphones would continue to account for 40 percent to 50 percent of TSMC’s revenue. A slowing smartphone market was one of the reasons the company cut revenue targets this year. It also reduced capital spending for the year from $11.5 billion-$12 billion to $10 billion-$10.5 billion - a move it attributed at the time partly to more efficient equipment delivery and currency adjustments, but which Liu acknowledged was also influenced by softer demand. Meanwhile, new markets such as autonomous vehicles and the “internet of things” - interconnected consumer and industrial devices - have been slow to arrive. Liu chuckled as he predicted self-driving cars would come “within our lifetime,” but said little about when they might benefit TSMC. “The issue is that these new areas are not going to be big enough in the foreseeable horizon to offset the slowing growth of smartphones,” said Mark Li, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. Liu was more optimistic about the sophisticated chips that power data centers. The boost TSMC and others enjoyed from the sale of such advanced processors for mining cryptocurrencies has largely dissipated, but Liu said the sector had made a lasting impact on high-performance computing (HPC). “They have an amazing architecture innovation and it will carry onto other areas of HPC, including blockchain and artificial intelligence applications,” he said. Moves by consumer tech giants such as Google GOOGL.O to design their own chips could also be a boon for a company that vows to be ""everyone's foundry."" Liu, who worked at Intel and AT&T’s Bell Laboratories before joining TSMC in 1993, shares the job of running the company with chief executive C.C. Wei, another industry veteran. One major investor, speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss individual companies, said he was cautiously optimistic that they could adequately replace “hero” Morris Chang, who ran TSMC for 30 years. Analysts say the company has some fresh opportunities with the pull-back of GlobalFoundries and could win more business from top chip vendors, including AMD and Qualcomm. Still, Liu acknowledged that global overcapacity in an older production technology, stemming in part from new investment by mainland Chinese firms, “gives you headaches.” The company said that category accounted for 23 percent of the company’s revenues. And questions about long-term growth loom large. Liu expressed optimism that the current “cooling down” in smartphones would last only a couple of years before 5G technology drives a new round of growth. But it is far from a sure thing. “What they are doing right now is moderating their spending, and returning extra cash back to investors,” said Li of Sanford C. Bernstein. The big test for Liu, he added, is to prepare “for something new, some growth in the next era.” Liu is confident that will happen, and said the company may increase spending on advanced production techniques in light of the GlobalFoundries retreat. In China, where the company has pledged to invest $3 billion on its latest factory, Liu said TSMC would stay on the offensive. “We will (invest more) to make sure we have a local position to compete,” Liu said.

TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker, said over the weekend a number of its computer systems and fab tools had been infected by a virus and that it expected a full recovery on Monday. It expected the incident to cause shipment delays and forecast a hit to its third-quarter financial results. Mark Li, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, said in a report on Sunday technology giant Apple was one of the impacted customers but a swift recovery in the fourth quarter should keep the impact minimal. “Long-term, TSMC’s trustworthy image is somewhat tainted but it is hard to quantify the effect now,” Li said. KGI Securities said in a report on Monday that while some of TSMC’s 12-inch wafer shipments will be delayed, the impact to the upcoming iPhone launch is limited because “the upstream supply chain usually prepares for these incidents and manufactures surplus chipsets during the initial ramp-up stage”. Apple did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. TSMC said it did not have any additional information for now. TSMC has said it maintained its previous forecast of high single-digit revenue growth for 2018 as shipments delayed in the third quarter would recover in the fourth quarter. As of 0124 GMT, TSMC shares were down 1 percent at T$245.0, compared with a 0.02 percent fall for the benchmark index.

TSMC, which makes chips for technology giants such as Apple Inc, Qualcomm Inc and Nvidia Corp, its lowered 2018 revenue growth forecast to a high single digit percent from 10 percent previously, and trimmed its expected capex range to $10-10.5 billion from $11.5-12 billion. For the April-June, TSMC reported a 9 percent rise in net profit from a year earlier to T$72.29 billion ($2.36 billion), in line with market estimates, on strong demand for high-end chips used in cryptocurrency mining. Revenue rose 11 percent to US$7.85 billion, the middle of the US$7.8 billion to US$7.9 billion range TSMC forecast in April. Sales to the personal computer industry accounted for 21 percent of total revenue, from 8 percent a year prior, while revenue from the communications sector that includes smartphones fell to 48 percent from 58 percent. The firm could face slowing demand for high-end chips used in cryptocurrency mining as miners switch to lower-powered chips due to price volatility as well as increased regulatory scrutiny of the sector, analysts said. “We anticipate our business will benefit from new product launches ... while cryptocurrency mining demand will decrease from the second quarter,” Chief Financial Officer Lora Ho told analysts. An intensifying trade spat between the United States and China could also be a near-term risk for TSMC, which has many of its biggest clients in mainland China, analysts said. Revenue from China jumped to 23 percent from 11 percent a year earlier, though North America remains its biggest market with 53 percent of total revenue, down from 59 percent.

Protracted trade tensions between Washington and Beijing could hit China’s semiconductor industry and companies across the electronics supply chain, Morris Chang, who founded Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC), said at the company’s annual shareholders’ meeting. “If the U.S. and China get into a serious trade dispute, or what some call a trade war, and if the trade war starts to involve the electronics supply chain, then we’re going to be affected in some way,” said 86-year-old Chang, known as the founder of the semiconductor industry in Taiwan. TSMC has a very large revenue base in the United States and a similar revenue base in China, making it a significant link in the semiconductor chain, he said. Chang said China’s semiconductor industry will see a lot of progress in the next 5-10 years, but it will still lag behind TSMC, which includes Apple Inc among its customers. “The distance between us will be about the same in 5-10 years. If I wanted to brag, I’d say the distance will be longer,” said Chang. He founded TSMC in 1987 and pioneered contract chip manufacturing for chip design firms that do not have their own factories. Chang, whose career included 25 years at Texas Instruments, said he was now looking forward to writing his autobiography, playing bridge, attending more concerts and traveling. He will be succeeded as chairman by Mark Liu, who had been co-CEO with C.C. Wei since 2013. Wei will become the sole CEO."

12.564808516054176," TSMC to invest $14 billion in R&D at Hsinchu facility TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co 2330.TW, the world's largest contract chipmaker, is planning a T$400 billion ($13.50 billion) investment to expand its research and development capacity for future technologies, a company spokeswoman said on Friday. The initial planned investment is a “ballpark figure” and is for several years down the line, Elizabeth Sun told Reuters in a phone call. The proposed investment is subject to the government’s ability to procure and integrate more land into the Hsinchu science park in Taiwan, which is currently full, as well as to environmental assessments, Sun added. Hsinchu serves as the company’s headquarters, a major production facility, and its research and development center, which focuses on future chip technology. “This piece of land, if we’re able to acquire it, it would be for all the future R&D activities,” Sun said. “Right now we’re already doing 5 nanonmeter R&D. In the future, it’ll be 3 nm and beyond.” Earlier this month, TSMC revised its full-year revenue target to the low end of its earlier forecast due to softer demand for smartphones and uncertainty in cryptocurrency mining market. At the same time, it said it expects high-performance computing chips to make up a greater share of the company’s growth over the next five years. The chips are used in such quick-growing fields as artificial intelligence, cryptocurrency mining and blockchain. ($1 = 29.6380 Taiwan dollars)"

11.044034316735459," UPDATE 2-STMicro sends upbeat signal on smartphone demand in second half * Q1 revenue up 22 pct * Sees “healthy demand” in H2 * ASM, TSMC warned about flat smartphone orders * Shares rise (Adds analyst comment, CEO quotes, shares) By Mathieu Rosemain PARIS, April 25 (Reuters) - STMicroelectronics on Wednesday delivered an upbeat assessment on second-half demand for its smartphones-focused products, brushing off investor anxiety over the soft takeoff of Apple’s iPhone X. The Franco-Italian chipmaker, whose customers range from carmakers to industrial groups and makers of new connected devices, said sales should grow in the first half, offsetting a seasonal smartphone dip in the first three months of the year. STMicro’s shares were up by more than 4 percent at 0919 GMT, making the stock one of the top ten performers in the pan-European STOXX 600 index. The Geneva-based group forecasts come as investor concerns about a potential stagnation of smartphone demand intensified after South Korean chipmaker SK Hynix Inc Inc’s warned of a slower growth in smartphone chip sales on Tuesday. SK Hynix Inc outlook echoed a warning last week from Apple supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and European rival AMS of a downturn owing to weak orders. Analysts estimate that Apple represents about 10 percent of STMicro’s revenues. The group makes imaging and proximity sensor products used in the iPhone X, according to analysts. “We expect STMicro to benefit from a strong second-half due to continuing strength in the automotive and IoT (Internet of Things) segments, and the ramp of multiple new iPhone models with 3D sensing later in the year,” Liberum said in a note. STMicro does not name its customers, but chief executive Carlo Bozotti said he expected “healthy demand” across all its products in the second-half, including smartphones. The veteran STMicro boss, who is expected to make way for his deputy Jean-Marc Chery to take over in June, said demand from the automotive industry was particularly high. “We see a strong demand on automotive everywhere,” he said during a call with analysts. “We don’t see any sign of accumulation of inventories. Just the opposite.” First-quarter results were in line with market expectations. The group’s quarterly net revenues rose 22 percent to $2.23 billion from a year earlier but fell from the last quarter of 2017 due to a seasonal smartphone dip. Gross margin rose to 39.9 percent from 37.7 percent. The group sees first-half revenues to grow by 19.8 percent from the same period a year earlier."

8.394460724021705," TSMC shares slide as revenue estimate cut; other Apple, chip stocks also fall TAIPEI (Reuters) - Shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd tumbled and other Apple supplier and chip stocks fell after it cut its full-year revenue target on softer demand for smartphones. Also citing uncertainty in the cryptocurrency mining market, the world’s largest contract chipmaker said revenue for 2018 is likely to grow 10 percent rather than the earlier forecast of 10-15 percent. TSMC’s shares slid as much as 6.8 percent in morning trade to its lowest level since Dec. 29. A raft of analysts read a prediction of softer-than-expected smartphone demand as driven chiefly be concern about demand for iPhones. Apple is believed to account for nearly 20 percent of the Taiwanese company’s revenue. Barclays said on Thursday some Apple suppliers will likely see choppiness into June due to weakness in handset sales, while Mizuho Securities USA said it sees limited upside to 2018 iPhone unit shipment estimates. In the United States, shares of Apple and its suppliers including Qualcomm Inc, Intel Corp, Qorvo Inc, Skyworks Solutions Inc and Broadcom Inc fell by 2 percent to 5 percent. In Japan, shares of semiconductor equipment makers and electronic component makers, including Tokyo Electron and Advantest Corp also lost ground."
4.39160634867203," TSMC's smartphone warning points squarely at Apple: analysts (Reuters) - Shares in Apple Inc AAPL.O and its suppliers fell on Thursday after a raft of analysts read a prediction of softer smartphone sales from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd 2330.TW as driven chiefly by concern about demand for iPhones. TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker and a major Apple supplier, revised its full-year revenue target to the low end of its earlier forecast. “Apple represents nearly 20 percent of TSMC’s revenue so the outlook potentially points to weaker-than-anticipated iPhone demand,” Atlantic Equities analyst James Cordwell told Reuters. Others, some asking not to be quoted, said baldly that the warning was “exactly” about Apple. Mizuho Securities USA said in a client note that its checks continue to point to soft demand for iPhone X, the Cupertino-based firm’s tenth anniversary phone released last November, in addition to a steady fall in iPhone 8 and 8 Plus orders. Apple’s shares were last down 2.5 percent and were the biggest drag on the tech-heavy Nasdaq index. Shares of Apple suppliers including Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O, Intel Corp INTC.O, Qorvo Inc QRVO.O, Skyworks Solutions Inc SWKS.O and Broadcom Inc AVGO.O fell by 2 percent to 5 percent. “Until the new iPhones in the Fall start driving the production food chain in Q3, mobile’s going to be weak,” Elazar Advisors analyst Chaim Siegel said. TSMC, also a supplier to Qualcomm and Nvidia Corp NVDA.O, said it expects growth this year of 5 percent for the global semiconductor industry, weaker than an earlier forecast of 5-7 percent. Data provider TrendForce had earlier estimated 2018 global smartphone production at around 1.5 billion units, 2.8 percent up on 2017 but down from a previously expected 5 percent. TSMC on Thursday estimated 8 percent growth for contract chipmakers, compared with its previous forecast of 9-10 percent. U.S.-listed shares of TSMC TSM.N were down 6 percent, while other chip equipment makers such as Applied Materials Inc AMAT.O and Lam Research Corp LRCX.O fell about 5 percent and ASML Holding NV ASML.O lost 3.6 percent. Another big industry bellwether, chip equipment maker Lam Research, said on Wednesday its shipments missed consensus estimates for the first time in five years. Chipmakers Analog Devices Inc ADI.O, Micron Technology MU.O and Xilinx Inc XLNX.O were also down by 3 percent to 4 percent."
4.39160634867203," TSMC trims full-year revenue estimate on weaker smartphone demand TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd 2330.TW, the world's largest contract chipmaker, revised its full-year revenue target to the low end of its earlier forecast due to softer demand for smartphones and uncertainty in cryptocurrency mining market. Revenue for 2018 is likely to grow 10 percent rather than the earlier forecast of 10-15 percent, Co-Chief Executive C.C. Wei told an earnings briefing. “The China market started to pick up in smartphones, but TSMC’s smartphone segment, which is very high end, was softer,” Wei said. The comments come after industry data showed worldwide smartphone shipment volumes shrank for the first time last year, with high-end brands coming under increasing competition from the likes of low-cost Chinese vendor Xiaomi. TSMC said it expects growth this year of 5 percent for the global semiconductor industry, weaker than an earlier forecast of 5-7 percent, and 8 percent for contract chipmakers, rather than its previous forecast of 9-10 percent. It also said it expects high-performance computing chips to make up 40 percent of the company’s growth over the next five years, from an initial estimate of 25 percent. The chips are used in such quick-growing fields as artificial intelligence, cryptocurrency mining and blockchain. For January-March, the supplier to Apple Inc AAPL.O, Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O and Nvidia Corp NVDA.O reported a 2.5 percent rise in net profit at T$89.8 billion ($3.1 billion) - in line with market estimates and a record for the first quarter. For the second quarter, TSMC sees revenue in a range of $7.8 billion to $7.9 billion, 10.5 to 12 percent higher than a year earlier. Analysts said second-quarter risks for TSMC include an intensifying trade war between the United States and China, where many of its biggest clients are located. In addition, demand for cryptocurrency-related chips could slow due to increased regulatory scrutiny of the sector as well as price volatility that has seen miners switch to lower-powered chips. TSMC President Mark Liu said he expected minimal impact from a U.S. ban on American companies selling parts to China's ZTE Corp 0763.HK, a maker of telecommunications equipment and smartphones reprimanded for failing to fully comply with U.S. regulators. “We think the effect is very, very minimal. Currently we are studying the impact on ZTE suppliers but at first glance, we have a very wide customer base, so ZTE, depending on where its suppliers are from ... we being everyone’s foundry, we have a very wide spread ... the impact is minimal,” Liu said. The firm also said it would add $1 billion to its capital spending target this year, bringing the range to $11.5 billion to $12 billion. Prior to the earnings announcement, shares in TSMC closed up 2.7 percent versus a 1 percent rise in the wider market .TWII. The stock has risen around 6 percent so far this year."
