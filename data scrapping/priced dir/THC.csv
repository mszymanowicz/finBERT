24.574397349479334," Tenet withdraws from proposed $350 million Tennessee hospital deal (Reuters) - Hospital operator Tenet Healthcare Corp said on Wednesday it no longer intends to sell two Memphis-area hospitals and certain related facilities to Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare, following a lawsuit by a U.S. regulator. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission last month filed a lawsuit aimed at stopping Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare, which has four hospitals in the Memphis area, from acquiring two more in a deal valued at $350 million. The purchase would reduce the number of hospital systems providing general acute care in the Memphis area from four to three and give Methodist some 60% of that market, the agency had said last month. In a regulatory filing here, Tenet said it withdrew its sale submission on Wednesday, and is working with the FTC to dismiss the lawsuit."
59.96790369181382," U.S. sues to block $350 million Tennessee hospital deal WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission filed a lawsuit aimed at stopping Methodist Le Bonheur Healthcare, which has four hospitals in the Memphis area, from acquiring two more in a deal valued at $350 million, the agency said on Friday. The five FTC commissioners voted unanimously to bring the lawsuit, which would stop Methodist from buying two hospitals, known as St. Francis, now owned by Tenet Healthcare Corp. The purchase would reduce the number of hospital systems providing general acute care in the Memphis area from four to three and give Methodist some 60% of that market, the agency said. The companies said in a statement that they were “surprised” by the FTC opposition. “We are reviewing this recent action by the FTC and actively considering next steps,” said Sally Hurt-Deitch, CEO of Saint Francis Healthcare and Michael Ugwueke, president of Methodist Le Bonheur, in a joint email statement."
68.0433951697585," Tenet Healthcare profit beats as hospital visits rise amid pandemic (Reuters) - Hospital operator Tenet Healthcare Corp's THC.N quarterly profit exceeded analysts' estimates on Tuesday as more COVID-19 patients were treated and people opted to resume elective procedures after coronavirus restrictions eased. The Dallas, Texas-based company said net operating revenue from its hospital segment, which mainly includes its acute care and specialty hospitals, rose by 17% on a same-hospital basis versus last year. Tenet’s net operating revenue fell marginally to $4.56 billion in the quarter ended Sept. 30. Excluding items, it earned 64 cents per share, beating analysts’ estimates of 31 cents per share. The hospital operator reported a net loss from continuing operations attributable to common shareholders of $197 million, versus a loss of $227 million last year. Tenet, which operates 65 hospitals and about 500 other healthcare facilities, furloughed around 10% of its workforce due to a drop in elective surgeries during the virus outbreak, Reuters reported in April."

48.05123318770786," Tenet Healthcare warns of significant COVID-19 impact in second quarter (Reuters) - Tenet Healthcare Corp THC.N on Monday warned of a significant hit from the COVID-19 pandemic in the current quarter, even as the hospital operator's quarterly profit beat estimates due to a tax benefit from the coronavirus stimulus bill. Patient visits to hospitals declined significantly in the second half of March due to a nationwide lockdown and as patients deferred elective care during the coronavirus outbreak, the company said. In the quarter ended March 31, the company reported a near 5% drop in same-hospital admissions, as patient volumes were impacted starting mid-March. U.S. health officials recommended postponing discretionary healthcare procedures during the pandemic in an attempt to save beds for COVID-19 patients, while infection-wary patients also delayed hospital visits. Tenet said its net income from continuing operations attributable to shareholders took a 69 cents per share hit due to the impact from the virus outbreak in March. The hospital operator has started to resume vital elective procedures and methodically re-open the hospital departments that were closed as a result of the pandemic, Tenet Chief Executive Officer Ronald Rittenmeyer said. The company said it is aiming for stabilization and recovery in the second half of the year. Tenet last month withdrew its previously announced outlook for the first quarter and full-year 2020, citing continued uncertainty due to the outbreak. Dallas-based Tenet, which operates 65 hospitals and about 500 other healthcare facilities, including ambulatory surgery centers, has also furloughed around 10% of its workforce due to a drop in elective surgeries during the virus outbreak, Reuters reported last month. For the quarter, the company reported adjusted profit from continuing operations of $1.28 per share, beating analysts’ average estimate of 32 cents per share. The beat was helped by an 81 cents per share tax benefit related to the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act, the company said. Net income attributable to Tenet Healthcare shareholders rose to $93 million, or 88 cents per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, compared to a loss of $12 million, or 11 cents per share, a year earlier. Net operating revenue fell to $4.52 billion from $4.55 billion. Shares of the company were up 2.5% at $18.4 in extended trading."

6.857717151600971," Exclusive: Tenet furloughs 10% of workforce due to coronavirus cutbacks (Reuters) - Hospital operator Tenet Healthcare Corp THC.N has put around 10% of its workforce on furlough due to a reduction in elective surgeries and other services brought about by the coronavirus outbreak, according to a letter sent to employees on Wednesday. Tenet, with about 113,000 employees, said most of the furloughs involve staff in administrative, corporate office and ambulatory care center jobs. Less than 3% of its hospital workers are being furloughed. Shares of Tenet, which confirmed the contents of the letter, fell more than 5%. The Dallas-based company operates 65 hospitals and about 500 other healthcare facilities, including surgery centers. “All of our ambulatory centers and certain hospital units which were not needed for this crisis have been closed or significantly ramped down,” Tenet Chief Executive Ron Rittenmeyer said in the letter reviewed by Reuters and reported here for the first time. He said the furloughs will have no effect on care for COVID-19 patients, or any other emergency or medically necessary care at Tenet’s hospitals. Several states, including New York, New Jersey and Washington, have required hospitals to halt lucrative elective surgeries in order to focus on intensive care for patients infected with the new coronavirus. The U.S. death toll from COVID-19, the highly contagious respiratory illness caused by the virus, topped 25,700 on Tuesday, out of more than 600,000 known U.S. infections, according to a running Reuters tally. Tenet earlier this month withdrew its previously announced outlook for first quarter and full-year 2020 financial results, citing continued uncertainty due to the outbreak. Wall Street analysts expect the company to post first-quarter net income of $39.7 million on revenue of $4.67 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Hospital administrators have said high-margin services, such as orthopedic and heart procedures, can account for up to 80% of revenue, while infectious disease and intensive respiratory treatments are less profitable. The American Hospital Association earlier this month warned of “a historic financial crisis” at U.S. hospitals, where “virtually all regular operations have come to a halt.” Tenet said it would continue to cover health insurance premiums for furloughed employees, who will be eligible for unemployment benefits. The company also has a fund for employees who have experienced hardship. Rittenmeyer said he would donate 50% of his April-June salary to that fund, while other Tenet executives would donate 10% to 20% of their salaries. Shares of Tenet were down 98 cents, or 5%, at $19.22 on the New York Stock Exchange."

Employees on furlough include those in certain administrative support jobs and corporate office jobs as well as healthcare workers involved in elective care procedures such as knee replacements and routine colonoscopies. “All of our ambulatory centers and certain hospital units which were not needed for this crisis have been closed or significantly ramped down,” Tenet Chief Executive Officer Ron Rittenmeyer said in the letter reviewed by Reuters and reported here for the first time. “While we are concerned for the COVID-19 patients we are caring for across our system, we are equally concerned for our other patients who must now wait to receive medically necessary procedures.” He said the furloughs will have no effect on care for COVID-19 patients, or any other emergency or medically necessary care at Tenet’s hospitals. Dallas-based Tenet operates 65 hospitals and about 500 other healthcare facilities, including ambulatory surgery centers.

The company also raised its full-year earnings forecast, sending its shares up about 5 percent to $25.19 after the bell. Tenet in December added another $100 million to its $150 million annual cost cut targets as the company looks to pare its long-term debt of $14.22 billion as of March 31.

Tenet said on Monday same-facility revenue grew 11.8 percent in the non-surgical business, reflecting strong growth in urgent care visits. The company raised its 2018 earnings forecast to $1.36 to $1.70 per share, from 73 cents to $1.07 previously expected. Sales in the company’s Conifer division, which it plans to sell, rose marginally to $404 million.
