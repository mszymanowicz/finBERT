-22.96486718080548," SandRidge Energy rejects takeover bids, saying they undervalue company (Reuters) - U.S. shale oil producer SandRidge Energy Inc SD.N said on Monday it had ended its strategic review and rejected all bids, saying they undervalued the company. SandRidge Energy’ implied liquidation value, obtained by totaling the highest cash bids, amounted to about $12 to $13 per share, which “meaningfully undervalues” the company, it said in a statement. The company’s shares, which closed at $14.30 on Monday, gained 11 percent so far this year. The company in June had announced it would review its operations, a month after activist investor Carl Icahn won a battle for control of the company, taking five seats on the board of the company that he wants to sell. Sandridge’s board Chairman Jonathan Frates, who was nominated by Icahn in April, said the company would be open to a sale “at the right price.” Earlier this year, the company said it had been approached by several potential bidders, shortly after Icahn forced the resignation of both its chief executive and chief financial officers. By the end of the three-month review process, SandRidge said it had executed 28 non-disclosure agreements and received eight offers to buy the company or certain assets. The highest cash bids received for the company’s properties included $305 million for a combination of the Mississippian Lime and additional other Oklahoma properties, $70 million for the Northwest STACK properties and $100 million for the North Park Basin assets, which were “not consistent with the current proven reserves and expected cash flows of these properties” said SandRidge’s Chief Executive Officer, Bill Griffin. The company said it will continue to focus on cost reductions, margin improvements and divestment of non-core properties while moving forward with a profitable plan for organic growth."

The list includes Midstates Petroleum MPO.N, whose previous attempt to buy SandRidge was rebuffed by the company - a move that was criticized by Icahn and some other shareholders. SandRidge, which said earlier this month it was approached by 17 potential bidders including Icahn, is seeking more bids and has launched a review of its assets and strategies. Icahn, who had then said he was not planning to make a bid soon, was not immediately available for comment. The investor won the battle for control of SandRidge last week, taking five seats on the board. Earlier, the investor had criticized the embattled company’s leadership and forced the removal of its chief executive officer. Of the 26 potential bidders, 10 of them were interested in buying the whole company, while 16 were focused solely on its assets in North Park, an oil and gas basin in Colorado. SandRidge has a market value of about $614 million."

-36.37931034482758," Activist Icahn gains control of board in proxy fight at SandRidge Energy OKLAHOMA CITY (Reuters) - Activist investor Carl Icahn on Tuesday won a battle for control of SandRidge Energy, taking five seats on the board of the U.S. shale producer that he wants to sell. Shareholders elected four of Icahn’s seven-person slate and two nominees put forth by the Oklahoma City, Oklahoma oil and gas company, according to a preliminary tally, with another position deemed too close to immediately call. The company later said it struck an agreement with the investor to expand the board to eight members, appointing an existing director and a fifth Icahn nominee. “We look forward to working together in a constructive manner as we execute our plan and continue our strategic review process to maximize value for all SandRidge shareholders,” it said. The company’s poison pill and executive compensation plan were rejected by shareholders, another victory for Icahn, who had urged a “no” vote for both. Icahn, who owns a 13.6 percent stake in the company, launched a fight for control of the board this year, arguing directors overpaid company executives, signed off on a costly deal that was later withdrawn and failed to pursue a February takeover proposal. Icahn did not reply to a request for comment and a representative of the billionaire investor attending the meeting declined to comment. SandRidge’s former chief executive and finance chief were ousted earlier this year as Icahn criticized management, and its board said it would conduct a strategic review that included a sale of some or all of the company. The company expanded its board, offering two new seats on it to the billionaire investor, but Icahn said he did not trust the existing board to manage a sale and nominated his own slate to replace them. SandRidge had argued Icahn wants to gain control of the company on the cheap by disrupting its directors’ review of a sale of assets or the entire company. Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis & Co, two firms that issue proxy recommendations, each backed four of SandRidge’s board nominees. Both urged holders to vote against the company’s poison pill and its executive compensation plan. Icahn last year challenged SandRidge’s $746 million deal for rival Bonanza Creek Energy Inc, forcing it to back away from a purchase he called too expensive and designed to benefit the company’s management at the expense of shareholders. Shareholders elected Jonathan Christodoro, John Lipinski, Bob Alexander and Randolph Read from Icahn’s slate. They also approved existing SandRidge directors Sylvia Barnes and William Griffin Jr. The settlement added Icahn nominee Jonathan Frates and existing director David Kornder."

Shareholders elected four of Icahn’s seven-person slate and two of the nominees put forth by the Oklahoma City, Oklahoma oil and gas company, according to results released Tuesday following the company’s annual meeting.

The activist investor, however, said in response he had no plans to make a bid soon, adding that any bid would depend on the approval of a majority of the unaffiliated shareholders. (bit.ly/2JUQugI) Icahn has criticized SandRidge's leadership, forced the removal of its chief executive officer and got the embattled company to back out of its planned buyout of rival Bonanza Creek Energy Inc BCEI.N. The investor, who said in April he was willing to buy the company, will now have to await a June 19 shareholder vote for directors as he seeks to revamp the board with his seven preferred nominees. Icahn holds a 13.6 percent stake in the company, according to Thomson Reuters data. “Some investors tip their hat to an Icahn-led board, as that might offer a quicker and possibly greater gain,” said David Beard, an analyst at Coker Palmer Institutional. “But it also seems that both management and Icahn want a higher stock price. Either way, shareholders should win.” The analyst reckoned most of the potential bidders could be from Oklahoma’s SCOOP/STACK region, a fast-growing shale oil play that is attracting investment as companies look beyond the Permian basin in Texas. Devon Energy DVN.N, Marathon Oil Corp MRO.N and smaller producers such as Colorado's Cimarex Energy XEC.N are some of the companies in the SCOOP/STACK region. SandRidge, which has a market value of $544 million, has most of its production in the north west STACK region. Its stock has risen about 18 percent since Icahn disclosed his buyout interest in April. Earlier this month, the oil and gas producer said proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services Inc (ISS) recommended shareholders should vote for the company’s board nominees. SandRidge also said Midstates Petroleum MPO.N, whose all-stock bid was rejected by the company in March, did not agree to its confidentiality terms, even after month long negotiations with the smaller rival. Both Midstates and Icahn, however, rejected SandRidge’s claims on Friday. “While SandRidge has offered a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) to Midstates, it would require Midstates to enter into a standstill, which is an unusual requirement for a party that has made a public offer,” Midstates said. SandRidge has informed Midstates that it will not provide internal forecasts to the company even if it were to sign the NDA offered by SandRidge, Midstates added. Siding with Midstates, Icahn said in a letter to shareholders that it is “inherently impossible to negotiate with a counterparty that demands unreasonable and onerous terms.” SandRidge declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. SandRidge’s shares closed 1.6 percent up at $15.61 on Friday, while those of Midstates closed 3 percent lower at $11.92."
-29.404228058936578," In SandRidge proxy fight, Icahn's reputation for turnarounds at stake HOUSTON (Reuters) - When SandRidge Energy Inc SD.N shareholders on Tuesday cast their votes for directors, the only question is how much sway over the embattled oil and gas producer they will hand to activist investor Carl Icahn. Icahn, whose hedge fund owns 13.6 percent of SandRidge and has said it could make an all-cash offer for the company, is assured of at least two of the seven seats under the formula set by the board and is expected to receive more. He is staking his reputation by pushing for a straight vote on his seven-person slate to manage a sale of the $544 million company after setbacks at Chesapeake Energy Corp CHK.N. The investor could win three or four seats with the support of many of its largest shareholders, activists or distressed company investors, said David Beard, analyst at Coker Palmer Institutional. Institutions including Icahn’s hedge fund hold 88 percent of the company’s stock, according to Thomson Reuters data, including Fir Tree Partners, Paulson & Co, Guggenheim Capital and Apollo Capital. Icahn was not available for immediate comment. SandRidge offered itself for sale after Icahn blasted what he called its ""nonsensical"" deal to acquire Bonanza Creek Energy BCEI.N. That deal collapsed, leading to the ouster of SandRidge's chief executive and finance chief. On Friday, SandRidge said 17 potential bidders including Icahn were preparing to view confidential financial data. The stock, which is off 26 percent this year to date, rose slightly to $15.44 on Friday. It has attacked Icahn’s board slate in a series of shareholder letters, arguing his losses from $7 billion in past energy company investments total $540 million. Icahn wants to “gain control of SandRidge without paying an appropriate premium,” it said. Icahn has support for three board seats from proxy advisors Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis & Co. The larger number would provide the billionaire “with a strong presence on the board, but without granting an outright majority to a shareholder who is admittedly part of an ongoing sale process,” wrote ISS on June 6. SandRidge would already have been sold if there was strong demand for its assets, which are largely in high-cost oilfields and in decline, said Coker Palmer’s Beard. It could take years to turn around the business no matter who wins the contest, he said. “Whether he wins two seats or all the seats, there is no magic switch that he can flip to drive shareholder value in the short term,” said Beard."

Icahn has criticized SandRidge’s leadership, got the company to back out of its planned buyout of rival Bonanza Creek Energy Inc and forced the removal of the company’s chief executive and chief finance officer.

13.096085409252666," SandRidge fights back against Icahn over board control (Reuters) - SandRidge Energy Inc SD.N warned shareholders on Tuesday they would be handing control of the company too cheaply to activist investor Carl Icahn if they elect his new nominees to the board at an annual meeting next month. Icahn earlier in May added two more nominees to his slate, demanding yet more influence after the company expanded its board to seven directors from five to accommodate the activist investor’s demands. In a letter to shareholders, SandRidge Chief Executive Officer William Griffin said the billionaire investor, who has said he could make an all-cash offer for the company, was not competing “fairly with other potential counterparties”. An Icahn-led board would “likely have a chilling effect on the participation of potential counterparties because such a process would be rigged in favor of Icahn,” Griffin said. Icahn has made a career out of shaking up company management and, as the biggest shareholder in SandRidge with a 13.6 percent stake, he has already forced the resignation of both its chief executive and chief financial officers. SandRidge’s shares, however, have fallen more than 15 percent since Icahn disclosed his stake on Nov. 21 and the jury is still out on how new management - or sales of company assets - would deliver more value to shareholders. A slump in oil prices and its exposure to costly production in the Mississippi Lime forced the Oklahoma City-based oil producer briefly into bankruptcy proceedings in 2016. Oil prices have since recovered to $80 a barrel for the first time since 2014 and shale producers in the United States have benefited from cheaper drilling methods and ever increasing global demand. The question is whether SandRidge now has a better spread of drilling sites to take advantage of the rise. David Beard, analyst at Coker Palmer Institutional said while short-term investors often penalize the valuations of companies with current, declining production, Icahn is betting on SandRidge’s undrilled locations in the hope that those will bring the production levels up. “SD operates in a relatively higher cost Mississippi Lime basin, thus the downturn hurt them particularly hard, having to drop almost all their rigs. This placed downward pressure on production,” Beard said. “But should production grow and undrilled locations become valuable, we can see net asset values approach ~$50/sh.” Icahn initially persuaded SandRidge's leadership to back out of a $746 million deal with rival Bonanza Creek Energy Inc BCEI.N but he has now spent months laying into its management. In April, the billionaire nominated Jonathan Frates and Nicholas Graziano - both of whom work for Icahn companies - to SandRidge’s board. The other three nominees are John Lipinski and Bob Alexander who have worked with refining company CVR Energy Inc CVI.N and Randolph Read, who has worked with investment fund Nevada Strategic Credit Investment. Ahead of the June 19 shareholders meeting, Griffin said Icahn’s continuous additions to the board would “end the impartial process, drive away competition and position Icahn to consolidate control as cheaply as possible”. Icahn's involvement and pressuring of Newell Brands Inc NWL.N to appoint four of his nominees to its board ran parallel to the company's shares recovering some of last year's almost 50 percent loss. They have since retreated to back to near record lows. Icahn's move with fellow shareholder Darwin Deason to prevent Xerox Corp XRX.N merging with Fujifilm Holdings 4901.T have seen shares in the photocopying icon fall around 25 percent from a 3-year high hit when the deal was announced in January. Icahn did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

18.150684931506852," Icahn nominates five to replace entire SandRidge board HOUSTON (Reuters) - Billionaire activist investor Carl Icahn on Monday nominated a five-person slate of his employees and business associates to replace the SandRidge Energy Inc SD.N board of directors, escalating his fight for control of the U.S. shale oil producer. The move sets up a showdown at SandRidge’s annual meeting later this year between the existing board and the hard-driving investor who has been trying to force the company to sell itself outright to either himself or another potential bidder. Icahn has spent recent months blasting SandRidge’s leadership, at one point accusing it of an apparent “disregard for any semblance of accountability.” He has successfully scuttled SandRidge's planned buyout of rival Bonanza Creek Energy Inc BCEI.N and forced the removal of the company's chief executive and finance chief. Now, Icahn has set his sights on the company’s board. A SandRidge spokesperson said the company will be reviewing Icahn’s proposed candidates and declined further comment. Icahn, who waited until a Monday deadline to nominate his slate, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Shares of Oklahoma City-based SandRidge, which produces oil in Oklahoma and Colorado, were off a penny at $14.64 in afternoon trading on Monday. SandRidge’s stock has lost nearly a third of its value since January, far below levels where Icahn first amassed his majority stake last fall. Icahn had telegraphed earlier this month that he was likely to nominate directors. He has said he is willing to make an all-cash offer to buy the company. SandRidge has not set a date for its 2018 shareholder meeting. The 2017 meeting was held in June. Most companies hold their annual meetings at the same time each year. Icahn’s slate includes current employees and employees or board members of companies he has controlled. Icahn, who owns about 13.5 percent of SandRidge’s float, nominated Jonathan Frates and Nicholas Graziano, both of whom work for the investor’s companies. The other three nominees are John Lipinski and Bob Alexander who have worked with refining company CVR Energy Inc CVI.N, which is majority owned by Icahn, and Randolph Read, who has worked with investment fund Nevada Strategic Credit Investment. Icahn has not always been successful in agitating for change at energy companies. In 2016, his hand-picked director at Chesapeake Energy Corp CHK.N resigned in what was widely seen as a tacit admission that the investor's turnaround strategy was not working fast enough."
