The winning trio, which had submitted an initial bid in July, plans to split Oi’s assets once they have antitrust approval. Oi, which filed for bankruptcy protection in 2016, is selling assets to repay creditors. The group was the auction’s sole bidder, according to the filings. The companies said the base price came to 15.744 billion reais, with another 756 million reais to finance so-called “transition services,” which Oi will carry out over the next year in order to facilitate the transfer of assets. TIM Participacoes, the local unit of Telecom Italia SpA, will pay roughly 7.3 billion reais of the base price and another 476 million reais for the transition services, it said in a filing. Telefonica Brasil, the local unit of Spain’s Telefonica SA, will pay roughly 5.5 billion reais of the base price and 179 million reais in transition services, it said in a separate filing. Claro will pay 22% of the total 16.5 billion reais, and in exchange be granted 32% of the subscriber base from Oi’s mobile business, it said in its own filing. In their new bid, TIM, Telefonica Brasil and Claro also offered Oi a long-term contract to rent its telecom infrastructure. Reuters reported on the overall pricing of the bid earlier on Monday. Brazil-listed common shares in Oi closed down 6.78% on Monday and Telefonica Brasil shares closed down 2.47%. Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa equities index fell 0.45%. ($1 = 5.11 reais)"

-25.077394823834183," Telefonica Brasil's second-quarter profit beats expectations; plans fiber unit SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Telefonica Brasil SA’s second-quarter results were pressured by the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on the economy but it still exceeded expectations as operations began to improve in June. Brazil’s largest wireless carrier on Wednesday posted a quarterly net profit of 1.113 billion reais ($215.98 million), down 21.6% from a year ago, but above a consensus estimate of 1.008 billion reais compiled by Refinitiv. “The scenario was challenging as the economic slowdown hit our business and fueled uncertainties... April was particularly tough, May a bit less and things only started to get better as of June,” Chief Executive Christian Gebara told journalists. The local subsidiary of Spain’s Telefonica, which operates under the Vivo brand, posted a 5.1% fall in quarterly net revenue, driven by both mobile and landline services, while store closures led to a 41% tumble in smartphone sales. Gebara noted, however, that 80% of Vivo’s stores have now reopened and said demand for mobile services, particularly pre-paid, is picking up. Shares in Telefonica Brasil were trading down 0.6% at 50.66 reais after rising as much as 3% at the opening. Analysts at BTG Pactual saw Vivo’s results as “resilient”, highlighting its “remarkable free cash flow” of 2.77 billion reais helped by lower capital expenditure. The carrier has been mulling alternatives to accelerate the expansion of its fiber network while limiting investments. In a separate filing, Vivo said it plans to create an independent unit to build and offer a neutral fiber network to wholesale customers. Credit Suisse analysts praised the move, saying it could create a more efficient capital structure. Parent company Telefónica will be Vivo’s initial partner in the new vehicle but it will seek at least one more investor by year-end, according to Gebara. “The goal for this unit is to start operations in 2021 and reach 5 million homes within four years,” the CEO said. Vivo is also bidding together with rivals TIM Participacoes SA and America Movil’s Claro for bankrupt Oi’s mobile unit. The three presented a new 16.5 billion-real bid on Monday night, which Gebara called a “reasonable” offer."

-1.1828038247309471," UPDATE 1-Brazil's antitrust watchdog keeps telecoms sharing between TIM, Telefonica (Adds context on the appeal, agreement) SAO PAULO, June 3 (Reuters) - Brazilian antitrust regulator CADE has rejected an appeal against an infrastructure sharing deal signed by two major telecoms in the country, Telefonica Brasil SA and TIM Participações SA, it said in a statement on Wednesday. Their rival, Claro, a subsidiary of Mexico’s America Movil SAB de CV, had argued the infrastructure sharing agreement hurt competition, but CADE decided to keep its approval to the deal. Telefonica Brasil, the Brazilian subsidiary of Spain’s Telefonica SA, operates Brazil’s largest wireless carrier under the brand Vivo. TIM, which is controlled by Telecom Italia SpA, is currently disputing the second spot with rival Claro. In December, both TIM and Telefonica Brasil signed two infrastructure sharing agreements involving 2G, 3G and 4G networks, which would allow them to enter more than 400 new cities each in the first year only. According to CADE, the reduction of costs for both companies through the sharing agreements “do not harm competition nor dampen the rival’s impetus to gain room in a highly disputed market”. Besides infrastructure sharing deals, TIM and Telefonica Brasil have also teamed-up to potentially acquire the mobile unit of rival Oi SA, which has been focused on divesting assets since it filed for bankruptcy protection in June 2016. In March, the two companies informed Oi’s advisor Bank of America of their interest in kicking off talks for a joint offer to buy all or part of Oi’s mobile division. Shares in Telefonica Brasil were down 1% on Wednesday afternoon, while TIM’ stocks were falling around 0.8%, with both underperforming Brazil’s benchmark index Ibovespa.

10.161673594466587," Telefonica, TIM to move ahead with Brazil M&A plans despite COVID-19 SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian telecoms firms Telefonica Brasil SA VIVT4.SA and TIM Participacoes SA TIMP3.SA are moving ahead with a potential joint bid for rival Oi SA's OIBR4.SA mobile unit despite the challenges of the COVID-19 outbreak, executives said Wednesday. The carriers have begun due diligence on a plan announced in March to acquire Oi’s assets together. Meanwhile, they remain focused on expanding their fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) network, as well as fourth-generation (4G) mobile coverage, while a long-awaited auction for next-generation spectrum remains uncertain. “We’re confident that our strategy is the right one,” Telefonica Brasil Chief Executive Christian Gebara told investors on a call, noting it is still early to assess the full extent of the global pandemic. “The level of uncertainty is much higher, but we’re not willing to cut costs or capital expenditure that will help us grow and compete in the long term,” TIM Chief Executive Pietro Labriola said on a separate call. The executives did not detail how long the due diligence on Oi’s mobile unit would take, but said they would have a clearer idea on the timeline in coming months. TIM and Telefonica Brasil are also working together on an infrastructure sharing agreement, pending regulatory approval, as well as exploring other partnerships to accelerate FTTH deployment in Brazil, they said. In the first-quarter, the two companies reported weaker-than-expected results, as the pandemic hit revenues, mostly in pre-paid plans and handset sales, overshadowing efficiency gains from digitalization efforts and other cost-cutting initiatives. TIM shares fell nearly 2% in afternoon trading and Telefonica Brasil slipped around 1%. UBS analysts see Telefonica Brasil, the local unit of Spain's Telefonica SA TEF.MC, which operates under the brand Vivo, less affected by economic and mobility challenges in the country given its premium brand and subscriber mix. “FTTH momentum and apparent competitive landscape stability provide evidence of Vivo’s resiliency, which should remain even as the pandemic and its effects further hinder economic activity,” UBS analyst Vinicius Ribeiro wrote in a report. At the end of March, 58.5% of Telefonica Brasil’s mobile customers were using post-paid plans. For TIM, Ribeiro flagged uncertainty about the impact of the coronavirus crisis, given the carrier’s higher exposure to pre-paid plans, which represented 59% of its mobile base in March. In the last two weeks of March, the local subsidiary of Telecom Italia TLIT.MI saw pre-paid recharges drop as much as 25%, said Labriola, adding that numbers are slowly improving as social distancing measures are relaxed. Vivo has also noted a slight recovery in handset sales and mobile data usage in April compared with the second half of March, when stay-at-home measures led customers to use more home internet and stores were shut by lockdowns. “We don’t expect customers to downgrade their post-paid plans because we offered a lot of benefits,” Gebara added."

Brazil’s largest wireless carrier said its net profit hit 1.15 billion reais ($206.7 million) in the quarter ended on March 31, according to a securities filing, below a consensus estimate of 1.34 billion reais compiled by Refinitiv. Its operating performance measured by earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) grew by 3.4% year-on-year to 4.5 billion reais, surpassing a Refinitiv estimate of 4.33 billion reais. Its EBITDA margin rose to 41.6% from 39.7% a year ago. The local subsidiary of Spain’s Telefonica, which in Brazil operates under the brand Vivo, posted a 1.4% drop in its quarterly net revenue to 10.8 billion reais, driven by both mobile and landline services, as well as lower smartphone sales. Meanwhile, operational expenses declined by 4.5% to 6.3 billion reais as a result of automation and digitalization initiatives. Vivo’s total customer base shrank 2% to 93.1 million users, as a 14.6% decline in fixed-line business more than offset 1.7% growth in the mobile segment, in which the carrier now has a market share of 33%. The company invested 1.65 billion reais in the first quarter, 2.8% less than in the same period of 2019, focusing mostly in the expansion of its fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) network, as well as 4G and 4.5G coverage. Shares in Telefonica Brasil have fallen over 13% so far this year, slightly underperforming rival TIM Participacoes SA , which on Tuesday also reported a lower-than-expected net profit amid stagnant revenues."

-17.081731038505627," Telefonica, TIM plan joint bid for Oi's mobile business in Brazil BRASILIA (Reuters) - Shares in Telefonica Brasil SA VIVT4.SA and TIM Participações SA TIMP3.SA rose in the morning trading as both companies said they are planning a joint offer to buy the mobile unit of bankrupt Brazilian carrier Oi SA OIBR3.SA. The move comes months after the struggling carrier, which filed for bankruptcy protection in June 2016, told market participants early in December it had hired financial advisors to put a value on its mobile unit. Preferred shares in Oi rose as much as 18% on Wednesday morning, while TIM stocks surged up to 8.3% and Telefonica Brasil climbed 4.4% before trimming earlier gains. TIM and Telefonica Brasil informed Oi’s advisor Bank of America of their interest in kicking off talks for a potential acquisition of all or part of Oi’s mobile division. If their bid is successful, the two companies would divide up that business, securities filings showed, without disclosing how the division would be. Telefonica, the Brazilian subsidiary of Spain's Telefonica SA TEF.MC, operates Brazil's largest wireless carrier under the brand Vivo. TIM, which is controlled by Telecom Italia SpA TLIT.MI, said it had informed its board of directors of their approach. It is not the first time that TIM and Telefonica join forces to broaden their operations amid an increasingly competitive market. In December, both signed network-sharing agreements involving 2G, 3G and 4G networks. In a separate filing, Oi said the joint bid attempt, which it described as “sounding out the market,” showed that there was interest in its mobile operation. “So far, however, there is no commitment from Oi or any other third parties to materialize such disposal nor has any biding instrument been signed,” Oi added. In September, Reuters reported that Oi was in talks with the two firms to sell assets and avoid insolvency. Executives from all three major carriers in Brazil - Telefonica Brasil, TIM and America Movil SAB de CV's AMXL.MX Claro - said at the time they could consider a deal with Oi. Analysts at BTG Pactual see TIM and Telefonica Brasil’s joint offer for Oi’s mobile unit as positive for all players involved. “As they will not compete with each other for the asset, preventing the entry of a new competitor and capturing great synergies with the deal,” they wrote. Oi, in turn, will have the opportunity to raise cash to partially pay its debt and accelerate investments in fiber-to-the-home (FTTH), BTG analysts added."

The local subsidiary of Spain’s Telefonica SA, which in Brazil operates under the brand Vivo, raised capital expenditures by 8% in 2019 to 8.844 billion reais. Gebara said Vivo’s investments in recent years preparing the carrier for a 5G network resulted in higher depreciation costs last year that ultimately hurt net income. Earlier on Monday, Telefonica Brasil reported a 14% drop in fourth-quarter net income from a year ago to 1.274 billion reais ($293 million), below an average estimate of 1.519 billion reais compiled by Refinitiv. Still, tight cost controls helped the company boost earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a gauge of operating profit known as EBITDA, by 23% to 4.967 billion reais, beating an estimate of 4.463 billion reais. In a research note, UBS analyst Vinicius Ribeiro applauded the “cost discipline” and said he could slightly raise future earnings estimates. Shares in Telefonica Brasil rose about 1% in Sao Paulo. Gebara said Vivo has room to improve revenues, as the transition to fiber broadband may help it lure new customers and potentially resume growth in its fixed-line business. He said the company has also been exploring infrastructure sharing to gain efficiency. In December, it reached network-sharing agreements with rival TIM Participacoes SA . He said Telefonica Brasil is also open to acquisition opportunities. “If an asset such as Oi becomes available we will check what the conditions and characteristics are for a potential acquisition,” Gebara said. In September 2019, Reuters reported that Brazil’s largest fixed-line carrier, Oi SA, was in talks with Telecom Italia and Telefónica to sell some of its assets. Later that year, Oi confirmed the hiring of financial advisers to put a value on its mobile unit.

He noted the company, which operates under the brand Vivo in Brazil, is currently more focused on growing its operating profit and revenues than margins. “We are constantly looking for new sources of revenue,” the CEO said, adding Brazil’s largest wireless carrier aims to increase services offered to its customers, as a lower inflation in Brazil keeps a lid on future price hikes. Besides tie-ups with streaming platforms to strengthen entertainment tools, Vivo plans to provide other solutions to customers, including credit to those who do not have a bank account, Gebara said. Controlled by Spain’s Telefonica, the Brazilian subsidiary also seeks partnerships to speed up fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) network expansion and reach more cities across Brazil, he added. The carrier recently struck a deal with American Tower Corp, which last year purchased the broadband network of state-run utilities firm Cia Energetica de Minas Gerais SA, known as Cemig. As part of the agreement, which will add 40 cities and 800,000 potential customers to Vivo in a three-year period, American Towers will build part of the network and Telefonica Brasil will cover the last mile. Additionally, the company put in place a franchise model under the brand Terra, targeting cities with up to 50,000 inhabitants. “With our own resources it would take a long time to expand FTTH, so we are very much open to partnerships,” the CEO said. Telefonica Brasil shares were up 1.4% up in early morning trading at 54.10 reais, lifting gains so far this year to more than 24%.

9.640384478512019," Telefonica Brasil and TIM to consider acquisition of Oi's assets in Brazil SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian carriers Telefonica Brasil and TIM Participações TIMP3.SA will consider acquiring assets from struggling rival Oi SA OIBR4.SA if they are put up for sale, executives from both companies said on Tuesday. In September, Reuters reported that Oi was in talks with the local subsidiaries of Spain's Telefonica SA TEF.MC and Telecom Italia SpA TLIT.MI to sell assets and avoid insolvency. “As the CEO of a publicly traded carrier, I have the duty to check whether or not it creates value to my shareholders once frequencies or backhauls (infrastructure networks) are made available,” TIM’s Chief Executive Pietro Labriola told reporters on the sidelines of Futurecom, a major telecoms event in Sao Paulo. Meanwhile, Telefonica Brasil Chief Executive Officer Christian Gebara said the company would consider acquiring Oi’s mobile operation for its frequencies. “This decision would depend on which frequencies will be auctioned for 5G and which mobile assets would be put up for sale ... We analyze the whole picture,” Gebara said. TIM is currently Brazil’s third-largest wireless carrier, and buying Oi’s mobile operation would allow it to gain vital market share and expand its coverage to challenge market leader Telefonica Brasil. TIM shares have risen less than 1% so far this year, underperforming Telefonica Brasil, which has climbed more than 22% in the same period. Besides the two companies, Mexico's America Movil AMXL.MX, through its local unit Claro, is also open to discussing a deal with Oi, Reuters has reported. Oi’s Chief Operating Officer Rodrigo Abreu has said the carrier would consider selling its mobile operation if it gets attractive offers. Both Gebara and Labriola emphasized it was too early to speculate on the rules for Brazil’s 5G spectrum auction, as the local regulator, Anatel, is still conducting tests on interference with other services. A 5G bidding round is now expected to take place in the second half of next year. “It is problematic if it happens tomorrow with rules that do not benefit the industry or the country ... I would be happier if it happens later but with the right rules that guarantee our investment’s return,” Labriola said. Besides the approval of a new regulatory framework bill for telecommunications approved by the Congress weeks ago, Gebara hopes for additional structural changes to guarantee the success of 5G deployment in Brazil. “The formula of the past will not be enough,” he said, saying there was a need for a tax reform and other measures to make the “technological leap” to 5G."

The carrier operating under the brand Vivo aims to lift prices in the postpaid mobile sector - in which customers are billed after the fact according to their phone use - in August, and in the hybrid plan known as “control” in the fourth quarter, he added. “We’re very optimistic about the country and the mobile business in the second half of the year,” Gebara told analysts on a conference call to discuss second-quarter results, which beat market expectations despite a 55% slump in net profit. He said the company expects competitors to follow a more rational approach toward prices, especially in the pre-paid service. Telefonica Brasil is also betting on handset sales to lift revenue in the coming months, according to Gebara. “We have been working on our inventory and we expect to compete with retailers,” he added. In the fixed-line segment, the Brazilian subsidiary of Spain’s Telefonica sees average revenue per user (ARPU) growing as it improves the technology by expanding the fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) broadband service. “We will be able to increase margins going forward as we bring FTTH to as many cities as we can,” Gebara said, noting the company might consider options to accelerate the process, such as sharing infrastructure with other players. Despite the current focus on organic growth, Gebara added the company is evaluating acquisition opportunities, including Copel Telecom, a subsidiary of utilities firm Copel, and state-run carrier Sercomtel, both based in the south of Brazil. Earlier on Wednesday, the company reported a second-quarter net profit of 1.42 billion reais ($376.31 million), above a consensus estimate of 1.338 billion reais ($354.39 million) compiled by Refinitiv, despite stagnant revenue and fierce competition. Analysts at Bradesco BBI judged the results as largely in line with expectations but highlighted soft revenue growth in mobile service. “We remain skeptical about significant improvement on this front, as Vivo needs to defend its dominant market share in postpaid as TIM and Claro improve their operations,” they wrote in report, referring to two of Vivo’s main competitors in the Brazilian market. Shares of Telefonica Brasil reversed earlier losses and were trading 0.2% higher at 53.62 reais in early afternoon. So far this year the shares have risen more than 23%.

In April, the carrier operating under the brand Vivo started lifting prices in the pre-paid segment after years of stagnation, he said, adding the company had previously adjusted prices in post-paid and control plans last year. “We see a positive trend in revenues despite competitive and macroeconomic factors that can affect results,” Gebara told journalists in a call after the company reported first-quarter earnings that beat market expectations. “Brazil needs more investments and network coverage, which demands a rational approach towards prices, and Vivo is making this move,” he added. Gebara also said long-awaited economic reforms by the Brazilian government should open room to new investment opportunities in the country. For now, the local subsidiary of Spain’s Telefonica is focused on expanding its FTTH network, as well as 4G and 4.5G coverage in Brazil. “And we intend to participate in 5G auction if the schedule set for March 2020 is maintained,” he said. Telefonica Brasil posted a 22.2 percent rise in first-quarter net income, outperforming its rival TIM Participações. Vivo shares were trading 1.5 percent up early on Thursday at 46.45 reais, among the best performers on the Ibovespa stock index, which was down 1.9 percent.

We see a very competitive market, but we also see opportunity to be more rational and raise prices,” CEO Christian Gebara told analysts in a conference call to discuss the company’s fourth-quarter results. The company, which is controlled by Spain’s Telefonica , increased prices in post-paid lines in September and December 2018 and now sees room to hike prices again this year, including for pre-paid lines, Gebara said. Alongside higher revenues, the telecommunications firm also expects cost cuts from automation efforts to translate into better margins. “We are increasingly using digital channels, artificial intelligence, which should help in reducing costs and improving margins,” Gebara said. Asked about the possibility of an auction for 5G spectrum, the next generation of high-speed cellular data services, Gebara said most current devices were not equipped to use such technology. “There is no environment for 5G, but we are preparing ourselves for this, while focusing in expanding our 4G, 4.5G and FTTH,” he said. Earlier on Wednesday, Telefonica Brasil reported its net profit dropped 2 percent to 1.5 billion reais ($404.55 million) in the fourth quarter, pressured by asset depreciation and stagnant revenues.

Christian Gebara, who was tipped last week to take over the company on Jan. 1, said he will broadly maintain the company’s current strategy and had a positive outlook for 2019, including the passage of the bill and a rebounding economy. The telecommunications sector overhaul was pushed as part of President Michel Temer’s reform agenda and aimed to modernize the law, removing demands of capital expenditures in areas such as public telephones in the streets. It has failed to reach a vote in Congress before he will step down on Jan. 1. Gebara said that the company is considering diversifying further into new financial products, saying it is analyzing offering microcredit, or lending small amounts of money.

Gustavo Nóbrega, head of marketing for Vivo’s fixed business, said the partnership was part of a larger company focus on enhancing the firm’s TV services. Vivo’s aggressive broadband expansion, particularly in ultra-fast segments such as fiber-to-the-home (FTTH), forms part of this push, he said. The ramp-up of the Netflix partnership follows a flurry of partnership deals Vivo has made in recent months with companies such as music-streaming app Tidal, Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O, and the U.S. National Football League.

30.97224704410269," Telefonica Brasil to expand paid content after inking NFL deal SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Telefonica Brasil SA, Brazil’s largest telecoms provider, aims to boost its paid content offerings in sports, music, television and other areas, an executive told Reuters on Wednesday, after rolling out a partnership with the NFL. Vivo, as the company is branded locally, announced late on Tuesday that it signed an agreement with the National Football League (NFL) creating the Vivo NFL Game Pass Season Plus, which allows clients to see all U.S. games in the coming season at what Vivo says is a significant discount to current options. The move follows a similar agreement between Vivo and the National Basketball Association (NBA) last year and is part of an overall strategy to aggressively increase content offerings, said Dante Compagno, Telefonica Brasil’s marketing and pay TV director, in an interview. “We’re betting on content. We’re going to expand significantly in terms of content in the coming weeks and months,” said Compagno, adding that Telefonica Brasil was eyeing a variety of genres. Telefonica Brasil, along with competitors like the Brazilian unit of Telecom Italia SpA, has focused on higher-end offerings in recent years, including paid TV and ultra-fast broadband. Some sports traditionally affiliated with the United States have slowly attracted a following in Brazil in recent years. Though still obscure in the country, Compagno said gridiron football has been among the fastest growing in terms of spectator interest."

The Brazilian unit of Spain’s Telefonica SA posted second-quarter net income of 3.15 billion reais ($841 million), up 261 percent from the same period a year ago and above a Reuters consensus estimate of 1.28 billion reais. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) came in at 5.18 billion reais. When adjusted for the tax issue, EBITDA came to 3.72 billion reais, up 5.8 percent year-on-year and roughly in line with the Reuters consensus estimate of 3.77 billion reais. In a call with journalists, Chief Executive Eduardo Navarro said adjusted net income, without the tax gain, would have risen 28 percent quarter-on-quarter, resulting in net income of slightly over 1.1 billion reais, slightly off the Reuters analyst estimate. Shares rose 1.5 percent at the open but pared gains to trade marginally in the red. In the quarter, Telefonica Brasil continued its strategy of focusing on data and high-end broadband products, which has proven successful for Vivo, as Telefonica Brasil is branded, as well as competitors such as TIM Participacoes SA . Revenue from fiber-to-the-home (FTTH), a type of ultra-fast broadband, rose 45 percent from a year earlier to 1.57 billion reais. Average revenue per user (ARPU) climbed 0.5 percent, reflecting a 10 percent rise for data clients that partly offset a fall of 23.5 percent in ARPU for outgoing voice clients. The company reported a rise in expenses related to interconnection in the quarter, while investments increased 18 percent, as the company committed to 4G and FTTH expansion. “In this quarter, we re-affirmed the strategy we laid out in March,” said Navarro, referring to an investors’ day in New York. Navarro said Vivo remained focused on organic growth, but was eyeing inorganic opportunities as they appeared. He declined to comment on the sale of telecom assets by state utility Companhia Energetica de Minas Gerais SA or by U.S.-based NII Holdings Inc, but said Vivo would take a look if debt-laden competitor Oi SA decided to divest specific assets. The company said its results benefited from 1.83 billion reais in one-off revenue in the second quarter, mainly due to a Supreme Court ruling earlier this year, overturning a controversial accounting principle in which many firms were effectively double-taxed."
