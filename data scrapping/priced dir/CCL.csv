37.78550833095871," UPDATE 2-Carnival sees near $2 bln in quarterly loss as cruise cancellations weigh (Adds details on forecast from conference call; updates shares) Jan 11 (Reuters) - Carnival Corp reported a bigger-than-expected preliminary fourth-quarter net loss on Monday as the cruise operator’s business was brought to a virtual standstill by the COVID-19 pandemic. The world’s largest cruise company’s shares fell 2% to $20.04 in morning trading, after plummeting nearly 60% over the last year as the health crisis hammered holiday tourism demand across the globe. Carnival, which extended its pause on U.S. cruise operations until March 31, said it was working to bring all its ships back in service by the end of the year. It hopes a broader distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and cheaper testing will help rein in the pandemic. The company said it ended the fiscal year with $9.5 billion in cash and has the liquidity to sustain itself through 2021, even in a zero-revenue environment. It expects to burn cash at an average of $600 million per month in the first quarter, about $100 million more than in the fourth quarter as it makes preparations to restart cruises. Carnival Chief Executive Officer Arnold Donald also said the company was well prepared to restart sailings to Cuba if a Trump administration’s ban on cruises to the Caribbean island was reversed by incoming U.S. President Joe Biden. The company reported a preliminary adjusted net loss of $1.9 billion for the fourth quarter ended Nov. 30, compared with analysts’ estimates of $1.58 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. In the third quarter, Carnival had reported a loss of $2.86 billion. (Reporting by Uday Sampath in Bengaluru; Editing by Shinjini Ganguli)"

31.133882126841783," Carnival reports smaller-than-expected loss, says cruising still in demand (Reuters) - Carnival Corp CCL.N on Thursday reported a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss and said advanced bookings for next year were improving, indicating renewed demand for cruising. The cruise operator, which sails AIDA, Costa and Princess cruises among others, has paused voyages since March due to the COVID-19 pandemic, bringing its business to a standstill. The company, however, said bookings for the second half of 2021 were at the higher end of the historical range, even as prices are down by mid-single digits compared to last year. Total customer deposit balance as of Aug. 31 was $2.4 billion, the majority of which were credits given by Carnival for canceled trips, compared to $2.9 billion last year. “We have come full circle from initiating a suspension in the early days of the pandemic, to transitioning the fleet into a pause status, right sizing our organization and, now, embarking on the phased resumption of guest operations,” Chief Executive Officer Arnold Donald said. The company’s cruises Costa in Italy and AIDA in Germany are resuming operations. The company said it would be able to generate enough liquidity to satisfy obligations for at least the next 12 months. Carnival’s third-quarter net loss came in at $2.86 billion, compared to a profit of $1.78 billion a year earlier. On a per share basis, the company lost $2.19, a cent less than analysts’ forecast, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

35.15380414312617," Carnival third quarter loss nears $3 billion, cruise operator to raise more money (Reuters) - Carnival Corp CCL.N said on Tuesday it expects to post a loss of $2.9 billion in the third quarter, hurt by the suspension of cruises due to the COVID-19 pandemic that has brought the industry to a grinding halt. Carnival also said it was planning to raise another $1 billion through a stock offering, adding to the billions of dollars it has already raised in debt and equity since the beginning of March, as it looks to stay afloat. Shares of the world’s largest cruise operator, which were down about 65% this year as of Monday’s close, fell 8%. The cruise business has been one of the worst affected from the health crisis and has forced operators to suspend ships, raise money even at the cost of pledging ships and led some to file for bankruptcy. “There is no clear path to reopening the cruising market right now, so they have to be very proactive in staying ahead of their cash needs,” Tigress Financial Partners analyst Ivan Feinseth said. However, Miami, Florida-based Carnival said advance bookings for the second half of 2021 are at the higher end of its historical range, even as it advertises and markets less, signaling strong pent-up demand for cruising. While some cruise companies are restarting operations in a phased manner, including Carnival’s Costa Cruises and AIDA, the industry is far from reaching pre-COVID-19 level capacity. The operator of Princess Cruises, whose ship at one point was the hotbed for spreading the coronavirus, said 18 of its less efficient ships have either left or are expected to leave the fleet, as it looks to cut costs and stay nimble. The company is expected to post an adjusted loss of $1.7 billion for the third quarter ended Aug. 31, excluding non-cash impairment charges of about $900 million."

Cruise lines, hammered by a crisis that has seen some ships turn into infection hotspots, had earlier said they were expecting solid 2021 bookings, mainly as repeat cruisers were eager to book their trips. The two ships, Island Princess and Pacific Princess, were set to sail from North America and Australia, respectively. Guests that had booked trips on these ships would receive a refundable credit for future trips for the fare they paid, and an additional non-refundable future cruise credit equal to 25% of the fare paid, the company said. Earlier in the day, Carnival’s Cunard also paused operations from November to up to May 16, 2021. Guests whose trips have been canceled would receive enhanced future credits. At least three Princess Cruises ships turned into hotbeds for coronavirus infections. One of them, the Ruby Princess, became part of a homicide investigation in Australia, being the source of the country’s deadliest virus infection."

The cruise line, owned by Carnival Corp CCL.N, had previously said it would resume some voyages on Aug. 1. Industry trade group Cruise Lines International Association (CLIA) said on Friday its ocean-going cruise line members, which include Carnival, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd RCL.N, and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCLH.N, would voluntarily extend their pause in operations from U.S. ports until Sept. 15. The cruise industry has taken a major hit from the novel coronavirus pandemic, with some of the earliest large clusters of COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the virus, occurring aboard cruise ships in which thousands of passengers and crew were packed in tight quarters. On March 14 the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a no-sail order for all cruise ships, which it subsequently extended to July 24. To survive for months without revenue, the companies have issued debt and pursued additional funding. In May, Norwegian completed a $2.4 billion fundraising through debt and equity offerings. Norwegian Chief Executive Officer Frank Del Rio told Reuters at that time that the $3.5 billion in cash that the company had on hand would be enough to bankroll it for “at least 18 months” without new revenue. In April, Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund (PIF), disclosed an 8.2% stake in Carnival Corp. The major cruise operators are not eligible to receive funding from the CARES Act, which was passed by Congress in March to address the economic fallout from the pandemic, because they are incorporated outside of the United States. Amid worldwide travel restrictions, operators have struggled to repatriate foreign workers living aboard idled ships."
-18.65037194473964," Carnival sees more pain after posting $4.4 billion loss (Reuters) - Carnival Corp CCL.N reported a record $4.4 billion in quarterly losses on Thursday, as the COVID-19 pandemic crippled the world's biggest cruise operator and forced it to take major write-downs on the disposal of now redundant ships. The Florida-based company said it had $7.6 billion available at the end of May, but was burning $650 million a month as it awaits regulatory approvals for the resumption of some lines in the hope that customers will come back later this year. The cruise business globally has collapsed after several liners, including some owned by Carnival’s Princess Cruises, became coronavirus hotspots, killing some on board and forcing port quarantines for hundreds more crew and staff. The company said it hoped to resume operations in a phased manner but was resigned to cutting back on overall capacity and had already agreed to sell six of its ships. The company’s shares fell 8% in early trades as it revealed a roughly $2 billion loss due to the difference in the sale price of the ships and their previously booked value. Carnival, which in recent weeks had fully drawn down a $3 billion credit line and issued $6.6 billion in bonds and equity, said it was looking for further waivers on debt repayments that are due next year, without which it could breach certain loan conditions. “The longer the pause in guest operations continues, the greater the impact on the company’s liquidity and financial position,” it said in its preliminary results for the quarter ending May 31. Cruise lines normally get bookings six months to a year in advance and Carnival and its peers have steadily had to cancel, refund or rebook thousands of tickets for customers since the coronavirus outbreak first hit ships in Asia early this year. The company said half of the guests affected by cancellations so far have requested full refunds, with the rest prepared to rebook. New bookings made in May for cruises in 2021 were down compared to last year, but were showing signs of improvement, it added. Excluding one-time charges, Carnival reported a preliminary second-quarter net loss of $2.4 billion."

Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCLH.N and Carnival Corp CCL.N said on Thursday customers were booking trips, even as there is no clarity over when cruises may set sail. Shares of Norwegian, Carnival and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd RCL.N, the biggest operators, reversed course following positive commentary on demand from Norwegian executives on a post-earnings call. The cruise industry has been hammered by the coronavirus as health officials asked customers to avoid cruises on fears of catching the infection and extended port quarantines in Japan and California added to worries. Norwegian Cruise’s Chief Executive Officer Frank Del Rio said the company noticed a significant amount of new cash bookings in April and collected advanced ticket sales. “It took decades to build this industry,” Del Rio told analysts on the call. “And in a matter of weeks, we dismantled it. And it’s going to take not decades to build it up again, but a little time. And we just have to be patient.” Norwegian said slightly over half of the guests who have had their voyages canceled have requested cash refunds as of May 11, adding there is demand for cruises starting in the fourth quarter and accelerating through 2021. Carnival said majority of guests affected by cancellations want to sail at a later date, with fewer than 38% requesting refunds. “It is clear there is tremendous anticipation for a return to cruising,” CEO Arnold Donald said in a statement. Carnival also announced layoffs, furloughs, reduced work weeks and salary cuts as part of its efforts to stay afloat. Norwegian swung to a quarterly loss of $1.88 billion on a $1.6 billion impairment charge as the COVID-19 pandemic brought the global cruise industry to a virtual standstill.

33.164556962025316," Carnival CEO defends company's safety record as cruise industry remains grounded (Reuters) - Carnival Corp CCL.N Chief Executive Officer Arnold Donald defended the company’s safety record on Thursday, telling reporters in a media call that Carnival followed protocols from international authorities while handling high-profile coronavirus outbreaks aboard two of its ships. On Feb. 3 the company’s Diamond Princess cruise ship was quarantined in the port of Yokohama, Japan, where 712 passengers were ultimately infected in what was then the biggest concentration of confirmed cases outside China. Nine passengers died, according to the CDC. Another outbreak occurred aboard the company’s Grand Princess cruise ship, which in March was barred from returning to port in San Francisco after authorities learned some passengers and crew had developed flu-like symptoms. The ship was subsequently quarantined: 21 passengers tested positive for the coronavirus and one passenger died. “With (the Diamond Princess) we did exactly what we were told to do, because we cooperated with the Japanese Ministry of Health,” Arnold said. “We followed their protocol; they decided to hold the ship, they decided to put the quarantine in place. Our job was to respect it and execute it, which is exactly what we did.” On the Grand Princess, Arnold said, “we worked with the CDC, we worked with all the local authorities there -- the governor, the ports, and as everybody figured out what they wanted to do. And we were in compliance with each of them.” On April 9 the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention extended its “no sail order” for all cruise ships for up to 100 days. The cruise industry is currently working on a proposal to submit to the CDC, which will include enhanced sanitization and health safety protocols, according to the industry trade group CLIA. Carnival’s shares are down 77% since Jan. 1. At least 138,482 people globally have died from COVID-19 and 2,078,071 have been infected by the novel coronavirus that causes it, following an outbreak that started in Wuhan, China, in early December. Carnival and other cruise companies are not eligible to receive funding from the CARES Act because they are incorporated outside of the United States. On Thursday Arnold said Carnival, which is incorporated in Panama, has no plans to re-incorporate elsewhere. He said that he hopes to have some existing debt in Germany, the United Kingdom and Italy extended and to defer the maturities on that debt at this time, as a result of stimulus packages in those countries. Speaking on CNBC on April 14, Arnold said Carnival’s bookings for 2021 are strong."

The stock has fallen about 30% since the close of March 25, a day before the PIF took the stake. Last week, Carnival said it was raising $6.25 billion in combination debt and equity and suspending its dividend payouts in an effort to ride out the health crisis.

Real estate stocks, utilities and consumer staples - commonly considered defensives - led declines following a rebound sparked by bargain hunters looking for stocks likely to weather an economic slump. Another set of gains for Facebook Inc, Amazon.com Inc , Apple, Netflix Inc and Google-parent Alphabet Inc, known as the FAANG group of stocks, helped the Nasdaq jump 1% on Tuesday. “Stocks have been on a wild ride ... (and) not surprisingly, investors are split on whether to lean in to or fade the current rally,” said Jonathan Golub, chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse Securities in New York. An unprecedented round of fiscal and monetary stimulus had helped equity markets stabilize last week following wild swings that sent the benchmark S&P 500 up 9% one day only to slump 12% in the next session. Wall Street’s volatility index has retreated from 12-year highs, but is still at levels rarely seen since the global financial crisis as the outbreak deepens in the United States and disrupts supply chains. Sliding from the record highs of mid February, the Dow Jones and S&P 500 indexes are now set to end the quarter more than 18% lower from the start of the year. The declines have erased more than $5 trillion from the value of S&P 500 firms in the first quarter, and investors fear corporate defaults and more mass layoffs going in to the second quarter. The blue-chip Dow is on course for its biggest quarterly percentage decline since 1987 and the tech-heavy Nasdaq is set to close out its worst first three months of the year since 2008. “While the majority of people want to remain optimistic that we’ve seen the lows ... that optimism is merely based on a lot of hope,” said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles. At 10:17 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 39.30 points, or 0.18%, at 22,366.78, the S&P 500 was up 0.54 points, or 0.02%, at 2,627.19. The Nasdaq Composite was up 51.60 points, or 0.66%, at 7,825.75. Shares of Carnival Corp, already by hammered by plunging global travel demand, tumbled 12% after it said it was raising about $6 billion in combination debt and equity and suspend its dividend payouts. The energy index jumped 4%, boosted by a rebound in prices from 18-year lows after the United States and Russia agreed to discuss stabilizing energy markets. Advancing issues almost matched decliners on the NYSE and on the Nasdaq. The S&P index recorded one new 52-week high and no new low, while the Nasdaq recorded seven new highs and 13 new lows.

Carnival Corp, also the operator of two coronavirus-stricken Princess cruises, has already temporarily suspended several of its ships due to concerns over the rapidly spreading COVID-19 crisis earlier this month. “The impact of COVID-19 is affecting personal routines and businesses as well as placing significant travel restrictions around the world,” Simon Palethorpe, president of Cunard, said. Carnival's rival Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd RCL.N last week said it would return to service only on May 12. Brokerage Berenberg said it expects the suspension of services by the cruise operators to last through July, with the entire summer season being meaningfully scaled back. “We do not expect services to fully resume until the back end of 2021 and think that it is highly unlikely that all ships that were in service will return to service,” Berenberg said in a client note. The brokerage lowered its price targets on Carnival, Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd NCLH.N by about a third, sending their shares down between 5% and 10% on Monday. Seabourn, Cunard and Holland America said in separate statements they would provide a 125% credit for future cruises to travelers impacted by the suspended voyages.

Carnival’s Diamond Princess ship has remained docked in Yokohama, south of Tokyo since Feb. 3, after a man who disembarked in Hong Kong was diagnosed with the virus. With 175 passengers and crew infected, the British-flagged ship has the biggest cluster of infected people outside China. Adding to holidaymakers’ worries about Asian voyages, the MS Westerdam, a ship of healthy passengers also operated by Carnival, had been sailing for two weeks looking for a country to dock. Cambodia finally agreed to let the ship dock and disembark its passengers on Wednesday. China reported on Wednesday its lowest number of new coronavirus cases in nearly two weeks, lending weight to a forecast by its foremost medical adviser for the outbreak to end by April. However, it was still unclear to what extent economic growth would take a hit from the virus and a global expert warned it was only beginning elsewhere. Carnival, which has already suspended cruise operations at ports in China, said it expects a 55 cents to 65 cents per share impact on its 2020 earnings if it was forced suspend operation in the rest of Asia. Analysts are expecting earnings of $4.52, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Rival Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd RCL.N said earlier this month it expected cruise cancellations to lower its first-quarter earnings by 25 cents per share."

-75.82143890848305," 'Oh my God, look at that ship!': massive cruise liners collide off Mexico MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Two Carnival Corp cruise ships collided on Friday in the port of Mexico’s Caribbean resort of Cozumel, the luxury cruise operator said, crushing the stern of a 952-foot-long (290-meter) vessel and leaving passengers stunned at the loud impact. One person was lightly injured while evacuating a dining room on the massive ship named Carnival Glory, according to Carnival, the world’s largest cruise operator. A passenger said the incident occurred during rough sea conditions. “Carnival Glory was maneuvering to dock when it made contact with Carnival Legend which was already alongside,” the company said in a statement. “We are assessing the damage but there are no issues that impact the seaworthiness of either ship.” Carnival added that the ship itineraries were not affected. Civil protection authorities in Cozumel said the incident took place at around 8:30 a.m. (1430 GMT) and that officials were investigating. Passenger Jordan Moseley said he was eating breakfast on the docked Carnival Legend, a 963-foot-long (294-meter) ship that can hold more than 2,000 passengers, when he felt the crash. “All of a sudden we felt the ship rock to one side and then back into place,” Moseley told Reuters. “A few minutes later, the cruise director announced that the Carnival Glory had crashed into our ship while docking due to the high winds and rough ocean conditions in Cozumel.” A video taken from an upper deck of Carnival Glory, which can carry nearly 3,000 passengers, shows pieces of the ship tumble onto the deck of the oncoming vessel, with some splashing into the churning water. “Oh my God, look at that ship!” an onlooker can he heard saying in the video posted on social media. Other images of the battered vessel show a railing along the Carnival Glory stern bent downwards at a roughly 45-degree angle, revealing a twisted and mangled ship interior. Christopher Macijeski, who was on a third cruise ship nearby, said there was a loud boom from the impact. “Could see it coming before it happened,” he said."
-75.82143890848305," Cruise operator Carnival sets sail for strong 2020 on Caribbean demand (Reuters) - Cruise operator Carnival Corp CCL.N on Friday forecast 2020 profit largely above analysts' expectations and reported better-than-expected quarterly earnings, driven by strong demand for its Caribbean cruises, sending its shares up about 9%. The company expects adjusted profit between $4.30 and $4.60 per share for its financial year ending 2020, the mid-point of which is above the average analyst estimate of $4.39, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Carnival is benefiting from growing demand for luxury travel experience, particularly for Caribbean cruises that constitute more than 30% of the company’s itinerary. “The Caribbean remains strong in occupancy and yield growth overall for our brands,” said Chief Executive Officer Arnold Donald on a post-earnings conference call. Changes in fuel mix, fuel prices and currency exchange rates are expected to increase earnings by $0.17 to $0.24 per share in fiscal 2020 compared with 2019, the company said. The upbeat forecast from the global cruise industry's bellwether also lifted shares of rivals. Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd RCL.N and Norwegian Cruise Line Holding Ltd NCLH.N were both up about 4%. Carnival’s net revenue rose 7.3% to $4.78 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of $4.57 billion, helped by efforts to draw passengers and increase on-board spending through attractions such as roller coaster rides, IMAX theaters, water parks and live music. Revenue from on-board spending, which accounts for nearly a third of total revenue, jumped about 30% to $1.52 billion. “The overall backdrop is that the consumer is very flush,” said Tigress Financial Partners analyst Ivan Feinseth. “Despite the negativity from the stock market thinking that eventually cruise demand will fall, it hasn’t,” he said. Excluding items, the company earned 62 cents per share in the fourth quarter ended Nov. 30, while analysts had expected 50 cents. Carnival’s shares rose as much as 9.8% to their six-month high of $51.20."

Fuel, a large part of cruise operators’ operating costs, accounted for about 11.4% of Carnival’s total operating expense in its third quarter ended Aug. 31. Oil prices surged recently following attacks on Saudi Arabia’s biggest oil facility that has triggered geopolitical tensions in the Middle East. Chief Executive Officer Arnold Donald said he expects a hit of 8 cents per share from the recent spike in fuel prices. “We have also made close-in deployment changes, including those made to address the recent situation in the Arabian Gulf, which has had an impact on recent booking trends and ticket prices,” Donald said. The company said it now expects adjusted earnings of $4.23 to $4.27 per share in 2019, down from its earlier forecast of $4.25 to $4.35 per share. The outlook overshadowed the cruise operator’s better-than-expected quarterly sales and profit.

-0.10149504785749545," Trump's Cuba cruise ban, weak Europe demand dent Carnival's forecast (Reuters) - Carnival Corp cut its full-year profit forecast on Thursday, anticipating a hit from the Trump administration’s sudden ban on cruises to Cuba and weakening demand in Europe, sending its shares down nearly 13% to a six-month low. Carnival is the latest cruise operator to warn of the financial impact of the restrictions on recreational travel to the lucrative Caribbean island, a move that has forced companies to reroute their cruises, usually booked months in advance. “Cuba has gone for the foreseeable future and not in the plans for next year,” Chief Executive Officer Arnold Donald said on post-earnings call with analysts. “That higher-yielding itinerary is off the table. And companies like us and others will have to adapt to see what they can generate.” Compounding Carnival’s woes was soft demand for the company’s European cruise brands due to a weakening economic environment and disruptions caused by the “yellow vests” protests in France. Travelers from continental Europe made up nearly 19% of Carnival’s total passengers in 2018, with cruises in European and Mediterranean comprising about 27% of its itinerary. Carnival’s guidance may cause investors to switch to rivals Norwegian and Royal Caribbean that have fewer cruises operating in Europe, Stifel analyst Steven Wieczynski said. Shares of Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd and Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd were down about 2%. Donald said the United Kingdom has been among the better performing European markets, despite uncertainty around Brexit. Carnival said it now expects 2019 adjusted earnings in the range of $4.25 to $4.35 per share, down from an earlier forecast of $4.35 to $4.55. The company forecast a 10 to 12 cent hit to full-year earnings from lower net revenue yields, a measure of spending per available berth. Miami-based Carnival said the Cuba travel ban would have a 4 to 6 cent per share impact on 2019 earnings, with another 8 to 10 cents blow from changes to itineraries caused by a mechanical fault to its Carnival Vista ship. Carnival said it had to add an extra sailing day to the slow-sailing ship’s cruises and will bear the related expenses. The company’s total revenue rose 11% to $4.84 billion in the second quarter ended May 31, beating analysts’ average estimate of $4.53 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Carnival’s shares were down 10.3% in late morning trading on a day when the broader markets have rallied."

-11.501103068830828," U.S. cruise operators stop sailing to Cuba, travelers vent anger online (Reuters) - Major U.S. cruise operators said on Wednesday they will no longer sail to Cuba following the Trump administration’s ban on travel to the Caribbean island, angering travelers and prompting worries about trip cancellations and company earnings. The new restrictions are aimed at pressuring Cuba’s Communist government to reform and stop supporting Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. “Due to changes in U.S. policy, the company will no longer be permitted to sail to Cuba effective immediately,” Carnival Corp said. A spokesman for Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings Ltd said the company had ceased all calls to Cuba and was modifying previously scheduled sailings. The U.S. State Department said on Tuesday the country would no longer permit visits to Cuba via passenger and recreational vessels, including cruise ships and yachts, as well as private and corporate aircraft. American Airlines Group Inc, JetBlue Airways Corp and United Airlines, which started flying to Cuba in 2016, said they were reviewing the revised regulations. Delta Air Lines Inc said it had stopped accepting bookings to Cuba under the so-called people-to-people license as of midnight on June 4. Customers who booked under the exemption before that time will be allowed to travel. “The reduction in the number of travelers will probably mean the end of U.S. commercial air flights from places outside Florida because there won’t be sufficient demand to fill regular flights,” said William LeoGrande, a Cuba expert and a professor of government at American University. The ban was effective as of Wednesday, the U.S. Commerce Department told Reuters, giving cruise lines no grace period to change destinations and sowing confusion among cruise passengers. Both Carnival and Royal Caribbean said they would stop at different non-Cuban ports and would offer compensation to travelers. Carnival said the guests currently aboard its Carnival Sensation cruise that set sail on June 3 would now stop in Mexican island Cozumel on Thursday instead of Havana. The company said the guests would receive a $100 onboard credit for the inconvenience. “We are working as quickly as possible to secure alternative itineraries for the remainder of our Cuba voyages and expect to have information for sailings further out in the next 2-3 days,” Carnival said. It has three cruise lines that sail to Cuba. Royal Caribbean said all cruises on the ‘Majesty of the Seas’ and ‘Empress of the Seas’ this year will have alternative ports in the Caribbean. It is also working on alternate itineraries for 2020 sailings. Guests can cancel their current booking for a full refund, or can keep their sailing date with a new itinerary and receive a 50% refund, Royal Caribbean said. On Tuesday, Royal Caribbean said its ships sailing Wednesday and Thursday would no longer stop in Cuba. Travelers took to Twitter to vent their anger and frustration over the forced changes in their vacation plans. “Has anyone’s cruise to Cuba from @CruiseNorwegian been rerouted yet? If so where did they change the port of call to? Im (sic) booked for July and PISSED! Thanks Trump!” tweeted Sabrina Carollo @superbri_22. Susan Berland, a parenting coach from Huntersville, North Carolina, said she was enraged that a vacation designed around visiting Cuba had been upended by the Trump administration. “To say I’m angry is an understatement. This whoe (sic) cruise was chosen around going to Cuba and now we can’t,” tweeted @SusanBerland. Neither responded to requests for further comment. Cuba accounts for a small percent of sailings at about 4% for Norwegian Cruise, about 3% for Royal Caribbean, and about a percent for Carnival, Wolfe Research analyst Jared Shojaian wrote in a note. Shojaian said that while cruise lines can easily swap a Cuban port for another non-Cuban port, guests may have purchased the itinerary entirely for Cuba. “That means cruise lines may need to issue refunds or future cruise credits to compensate guests, which makes forecasting the earnings impact to 2019 even harder, and potentially more of a headwind,” he said. Shares of Norwegian Cruise closed down 3.5%, while Royal Caribbean and Carnival ended about 3% lower."
-13.751868665830964," Cruise line Carnival seeks dismissal of U.S. lawsuits over Cuba docks HAVANA (Reuters) - Cruise line Carnival Corp is asking a U.S. court to dismiss lawsuits that claim the company profited from confiscated Cuban property, the first such cases brought since the Trump administration made them possible this month. Two U.S. citizens who claim to hold titles to the Havana and Santiago de Cuba ports that were nationalized by Cuba after Fidel Castro’s 1959 leftist revolution filed suits against Carnival in U.S. District Court in Florida in early May for docking there. That came after the Trump administration announced a long dormant and controversial section of the 1996 Helms-Burton Act would take effect on May 2, allowing U.S. citizens to sue Cuban entities and foreign firms over confiscated Cuban property. The law is part of a broader attempt by the United States to pressure Cuba over its support for Venezuela’s embattled government by taking aim at Havana’s beleaguered economy. Cuba sought to reassure foreign investors at an event in Havana on Friday, saying only four lawsuits had been filed so far, despite the United States saying there could be hundreds of thousands. The European Union and Canada have said they will use blocking legislation to protect their companies. “Helms-Burton has no application here,” according to a filing in the case by Carnival on Thursday. “First, by its own terms, trafficking under Helms-Burton does not include uses of property ‘incident to lawful travel to Cuba’.” These cases could set a precedent, especially in the travel industry. Some lawyers like Carnival’s say the travel exemption should shield U.S. cruise lines and airlines doing business with Cuba under licenses granted by former President Barack Obama during the two countries’ brief 2014-2016 detente. But U.S. courts could determine the travel they facilitate is tourism and violates the decades-old U.S. trade embargo on Cuba. “The fulcrum for determining the outcome of all travel-related lawsuits will be whether there has been tourism,” said John Kavulich, president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council Inc. Carnival also disputed the ownership of the two U.S. citizens who are descendants of original owners. Their lawyers did not immediately reply to requests for comment. Increased U.S. hostility, more than Helms-Burton, is affecting foreign companies operating in Cuba, said Xulio Fontecha, head of the Association of Spanish Businesses in Cuba (AEEC), at the event in Havana. Banks in Panama and Costa Rica had closed the accounts of some customers in recent months and courier services were declining to send documents to Cuba, he said. “The problem goes far beyond Title III, which we condemn of course,” he said, referring to the section of the Helms-Burton Act that permits the lawsuits. Some Spanish companies also received a letter from a group in Florida warning them of potentially being complicit in violations of human and labor rights, he said. The ambassador of the European Union, Alberto Navarro, said the bloc would continue to seek to expand business with Cuba, defying the U.S. hostility. He encouraged Cuban reforms to make the island more attractive to foreign investors and offset disincentives created by the Trump administration policy."
-14.594490335521126," Carnival first company sued for profiting from expropriated Cuban property HAVANA (Reuters) - Carnival Corp on Thursday became the first company sued for profiting from expropriated Cuban property as the Trump administration piles new sanctions on the Communist-run nation for supporting Venezuela’s embattled government. The administration last month announced a long dormant section of the 1996 Helms-Burton Act would take effect on May 2 as it ratcheted up the pressure on Venezuela and Cuba. Under Title III of the Helms Burton Act, waived by previous presidents, anyone whose property was nationalized after the 1959 Cuban Revolution, even if they were not U.S. citizens at the time, can sue any individual or company profiting from their former holdings. The suit was brought in federal court in Miami by Javier Garcia Bengochea and Mickael Behn. The former holds title to Santiago de Cuba port and the latter to one in Havana used by numerous U.S. cruise lines. Both men are descendants of the original owners. Lawyer Nick Gutierrez, an adviser to the claimants, said in a telephone interview that Title III recommends claimants notify defendants 30 days before filing suit. Gutierrez said Carnival was duly notified and thus the suit was filed on Thursday, with others to follow soon. “I know Bengochea has been in contact with Carnival and later will file suit against other companies including Royal Caribbean and Norwegian Cruise Lines,” he said, adding he would also file numerous suits for clients in the coming weeks. Carnival declined to comment on the lawsuit, except to say it was continuing its normal schedule of cruises to Cuba. It also referred to a statement from the Cruise Lines International Association, an industry lobby, saying the operations of cruise lines that do business with Cuba “falls under the lawful travel exemption under Title 3 of the Helms Burton Act.” Cuba charges Title III violates international law because its nationalization of property was legal and also because Cuban-Americans were not U.S. citizens when their properties were taken. All other nations settled their citizens’ property claims decades ago, while 5,913 certified U.S. claims by American citizens at the time of expropriation were never settled. Canada, the European Union and other countries charge the United States has no jurisdiction over their citizens’ activity in Cuba and they will take the issue to the World Trade Organization, among other actions. International opposition, and the fear that thousands of suits brought by Cuban-Americans would clog U.S. courts, led previous U.S. presidents to waive implementation of Title III. Title I and II of the Helm-Burton Act codify all previous sanctions into law and set conditions for the U.S. Congress to lift them. Title IV bans executives and their families from the United States if they profit from expropriated properties."
-11.399615664237688," Carnival cuts forecast on fuel costs, dollar headwinds; shares sink (Reuters) - Carnival Corp cut its annual profit forecast on Tuesday, expecting a hit from higher fuel prices and a stronger dollar, sending shares of the world’s largest cruise operator down over 8 percent. The company also maintained its 2019 expectation for net revenue yield, an important metric that blends bookings and on-board spending. Carnival’s weak profit forecast comes against the backdrop of strong growth predictions for the industry, despite a cooling Chinese economy and a Brexit-led slowdown in Europe. “I am surprised at some of the disappointing results from Carnival because I believe overall the industry is very strong and is seeing record demand and pricing,” Tigress Financial Partners analyst Ivan Feinseth said. Roughly 30 million passengers are expected to sail in 2019, up from 28.2 million last year, according to industry trade body Cruise Lines International Association. Rival Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd said in January that it was heading into 2019 with record cruise bookings, higher demand from Chinese tourists and rapid growth in tourists vacationing in Europe, the Caribbean and Alaska. Carnival Chief Executive Officer Arnold Donald acknowledged that industry trends have been strong, but said on a post earnings call that the yield forecast was left unchanged to account for headwinds such as hurricanes, and uncertainties in the global economy. The company’s full-year earnings forecast reflects $155 million, or 22 cents per share, hit from higher fuel prices and adverse currency movements, Donald said. Brent crude is up nearly 25 percent this year, pressured by supply cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, and U.S. sanctions on Iran and Venezuela. Miami-based Carnival said it expects adjusted earnings of $4.35 to $4.55 per share in 2019, compared with $4.50 to $4.80 per share, estimated previously, while analysts were expecting $4.77, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The company also forecast second-quarter adjusted profit to be between 56 cents and 60 cents per share, well below estimates of 72 cents. The forecast cut cast a shadow over Carnival’s first-quarter profit and revenue beat, as the company benefited from higher ticket prices and on-board spending. Carnival’s shares were at $51.97 in afternoon trading. The stock has risen 14 percent this year, compared with a 30 percent jump for Norwegian Cruise and 17 percent gain for Royal Caribbean."
14.509753803067," Cruise company Carnival sees profit below estimates, shares sink 10 percent (Reuters) - Carnival Corp CCL.N forecast current-quarter profit below analysts' estimates on Thursday, as the company faces higher fuel costs, and a stronger dollar that has crimped demand for cruises, sending its shares down 10 percent to a two-year low. The company said it expects adjusted profit of 40 cents to 44 cents per share for the first quarter, while analysts were expecting 45 cents. Carnival said it would take a hit of 3 cents per share due to the stronger dollar and higher fuel costs. Fuel constitutes a large part of cruise operators’ operating costs, accounting for about 15 percent of Carnival’s total operating expense in its latest fiscal year. Some analysts also cited company specific problems, especially the composition of its fleet. “Carnival has a large fleet of legacy ships. They don’t perform as well as newer ships. It is hurting (the company) compared to Royal and Norwegian,” said Tigress Financial Partners analyst Ivan Feinseth. Miami-based Carnival is refreshing its fleet of over than 100 ships and will add 18 new ships between 2018 and 2022, to replace some of its older, less efficient ships. Carnival said net revenue yields, a keenly watched metric that measures spending per available berth, would be flat in the first quarter from a year earlier. Yields rose 3.7 percent in constant currency in its latest quarter. The company also forecast full-year net revenue yields to rise 1 percent, which would be the slowest growth since 2015. The dour forecast Carnival, a bellwether for the cruise industry, also dragged down rivals' shares. Royal Caribbean Cruises RCL.N and Norwegian Cruise Line NCLH.N were down about 3 percent. Carnival’s outlook overshadowed better-than-expected fourth quarter results, that was helped by higher on-board spending and ticket prices. Carnival’s adjusted earnings were 70 cents per share, beating analysts’ estimate of 69 cents. Net revenue climbed 4.6 percent to $4.46 billion, above estimate of $4.44 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Shares of the company, which have fallen 17 percent this year, were down at $49.38 in afternoon trading."

The bleak outlook overshadowed the world's largest cruise operator's better-than-expected third-quarter results and weighed on shares of rivals Royal Caribbean Cruises RCL.N and Norwegian NCLH.N. Carnival, which owns the Queen Mary II and Queen Elizabeth cruisers, said it would take a hit of 11 cents per share in the fourth quarter even as it expects booking trends to be strong in the future. Brent crude LCOc1 has been trading at its highest in nearly four years and U.S. dollar .DXY has risen 2.7 percent this year. The oil prices are expected to remain high owing to controlled global supply. The company said it expects fourth-quarter earnings of 65 cents to 69 cents per share, well below the analyst average estimate of 73 cents. However, Carnival benefited from higher ticket prices on-board spending in the third quarter. Revenue from passenger tickets rose 5 percent to $4.35 billion, while on-board spending, which accounts for about a quarter of total revenue, rose 7.6 percent to $1.32 billion. Tigress Financial Partners analyst Ivan Feinseth, who has a ""buy"" rating on Carnival, said the weakness in the company's stock is a buying opportunity, adding that his number one pick in the industry remains Norwegian NCLH.N as it has the ""most fuel-efficient fleet"".

The company, which owns the Queen Mary II and Queen Elizabeth cruisers, said it would take a hit of 19 cents per share in the year related to the currency and gasoline prices even as it expects strong bookings to soften the blow. Carnival's comments come in contrast to rival Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd RCL.N, which also warned of similar headwinds but said strong bookings would offset the rising costs completely. “The industry has a lot of tailwind, so some of these issues are unique to Carnival because they have a large fleet and are in so many places,” Tigress Financial Partners analyst Ivan Feinseth said.
