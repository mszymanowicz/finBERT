8.321167883211682," America Movil forecasts $8 billion capex for 2021 MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican telecoms company America Movil expects to spend $8 billion in capital expenditures in 2021, company executives said on Wednesday. The planned investment will include the purchase of 5G frequencies, Chief Financial Officer Carlos Garcia Moreno told analysts on a conference call following the company’s fourth-quarter earnings. “For this year, we are around $8 billion, including what we are going to buy on frequencies for 5G,” Garcia Moreno said. Officials from America Movil, controlled by the family of Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, said there could be 5G options available in Mexico, its core market, before the end of the year after an additional purchase of 50 megahertz (MHz) in 2020. “We are in the process of reviewing the rules for those frequencies ... What Daniel is telling me is that from October 2021, there are going to be options on 5G in Mexico,” Garcia Moreno said, referring to Chief Executive Officer Daniel Hajj. America Movil’s shares rose more than 3% early on Wednesday after the company on Tuesday reported a surprise quarterly profit, which was nearly 80% higher than a year ago, helped by a favorable exchange rate. The shares later trimmed gains. The company’s sales dipped 3.1% from the same quarter a year ago. Executives also said that 35,000 to 37,000 telecommunications towers in its Latin American and Caribbean markets would be included in a spinoff entity it announced a day earlier. The new unit will focus on the development, construction and locations of the towers for mobile services, the company said."
8.40029218407597," America Movil surprises with 80% profit jump MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican telecommunications firm America Movil on Tuesday reported a surprise net profit of $1.87 billion in the fourth quarter, driven up nearly 80% by a favorable exchange rate. The company, which is controlled by the family of Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, reported the bonanza despite sales falling by 3.1% from the same quarter last year to 255 billion pesos. Net profit rose to 37.3 billion pesos ($1.87 billion) from 20.8 billion pesos for the same period a year earlier, an increase of 79.6%. The company cited exchange gains due to the strengthening of the Mexican peso against the U.S. dollar and the euro. Mexican financial group Grupo Financiero Banorte had forecast net profit falling to 17.7 billion pesos. America Movil’s sales slightly underperformed Banorte’s forecast of 258.7 billion pesos for the quarter. Local brokerage Monex noted a significant increase in postpaid mobile subscribers underpinning America Movil’s earnings. “We added 6.8 million wireless subscribers in the quarter, double the number in the previous quarter... including 2.7 million mobile postpaid subscribers,” the company said. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) grew 1.3% in peso terms during the October to December period. “These figures validate an important recovery in the services segment,” Monex said in a client note. However, with exchange rate fluctuations driving the profit, it said the report was “neutral.” In the core market of Mexico, America Movil’s base of postpaid customers grew 1.3% year-over-year and its prepaid base increased 1.1%. The company added 1.2 million subscribers, nearly all prepaid, to end the year with 77.8 million subscribers. America Movil’s board of directors also approved an asset reorganization plan on Tuesday for its Latin American towers, creating a spin-off entity focused on the development, construction and locations of the towers for mobile services, the company said. It expects to complete the reorganization in 2021. ($1= 19.9500 pesos at end-December)"
3.0325443786982262," U.S. states ask FCC to scrutinize Verizon's plan to buy Tracfone (Reuters) - The attorneys general of 16 U.S. states and the District of Columbia on Friday urged the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to thoroughly investigate Verizon Communications Inc’s proposed $6.25 billion acquisition of pre-paid mobile phones provider Tracfone and impose conditions if it approves the deal. Verizon said in September it would buy Tracfone, a unit of Mexican telecom company America Movil, in a cash and stock deal. The state attorneys general said the FCC “should examine whether the acquisition of TracFone by Verizon could significantly reduce millions of Americans’ access to affordable communications services.” Th letter added, “it is imperative that the FCC thoroughly vet the proposed transaction and impose specific conditions that protect and ensure the public interest before considering approval.” The state AGs are led by Virginia’s Mark Herring and also include those of Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Iowa, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont and Washington. Tracfone is one of the largest providers of telecommunications services under the government subsidy program known as Lifeline with 1.7 million low-income subscribers in 43 states and the District of Columbia, the state AGs’ letter said, while Verizon offers Lifeline in parts of four states. A Verizon spokesman said on Friday the company “will continue to offer Lifeline service through TracFone and further develop its core brands, products and distribution channels. Strengthening and growing TracFone will benefit value-conscious consumers.” Tracfone, which serves about 21 million subscribers through more than 90,000 retail locations across the United States, said last year more than 13 million of its subscribers rely on Verizon’s network under an existing agreement. Verizon is the largest U.S. wireless carrier by subscribers. “We urge the FCC to put the interest of the American consumer before that of big business and request additional information before allowing this acquisition to happen,” said Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel."

-6.795422031473541," UPDATE 3-Mexico beefs up telecom rules; Slim's America Movil bristles (Adds comments from IFT chief) Dec 8 (Reuters) - Mexico’s telecoms regulator on Tuesday launched a fresh bid to curb the market power of billionaire Carlos Slim’s telecoms giant America Movil, unveiling measures that limit fees the company can charge customers. The resolution by the Federal Telecommunications Institute (IFT) aims to curtail unwanted charges on consumers for services including unlocking devices, rates for out-of-network roaming and the end of promotional prices, the regulator said in a statement, without going into specific details. America Movil argued the measures do not reflect profound changes in the industry more than six years after the government stepped up regulation to weaken Slim’s hold on it. The firm said it “believes that IFT’s resolution is not based on an integral evaluation in terms of competition of the different markets in the Mexican telecommunications sector.” IFT president Adolfo Cuevas said that despite some successes in reducing America Movil’s market share, the company is still clearly Mexico’s dominant player. “This is in no way a punitive measure,” Cuevas told Mexican radio, arguing it was in America Movil’s interest to be part of a competitive market that encouraged investment and development. “Indeed, what we’re looking for with another sort of decision that will made public soon is to focus on collaborating with America Movil, because our main interest is for regulations to be respected,” he added, without providing more details. America Movil has long dominated the Mexican market and has previously clashed with the IFT over antitrust curbs. “It’s a monopolistic company wrestling against regulatory oversight,” said Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics. “On one hand, you can understand that from America Movil’s perspective. On the other hand, if they are successful, it doesn’t bode well for competition in Mexico.” America Movil, which emerged from a former state monopoly, argues that since a 2013-14 reform aimed at cutting the company down to size began to bite, it has not had the same power. The latest resolution came after an IFT review of the company and its subsidiaries that occurs every two years. America Movil vowed to challenge the resolution “in accordance with applicable law.” A company spokesman declined to comment further. Competitor AT&T Inc, which struck a deal with Spanish telecoms giant Telefonica SA last year over the use of some of its Mexico infrastructure, said in a statement it was waiting for the resolution to be made public to study it. “We hope that the regulator will take decisive steps to implement asymmetric measures that allow progress towards effective competition in the sector,” AT&T said.

11.539089560209417," El Salvador lays conditions for America Movil's planned $315 million acquisitions SAN SALVADOR (Reuters) - El Salvador's antitrust authority said on Tuesday it will allow an expanded market share for telecommunications firm Claro, a unit of Mexico's America Movil AMXL.MX, on guarantees that it will abide by competition and consumer protection safeguards. America Movil, controlled by the family of Mexican tycoon Carlos Slim, aims to acquire for $315 million two units of Spain's Telefonica TEF.MC that operate in the Central American country which could generate ""limits on competition,"" El Salvador's Competition Superintendent (SC) said in a statement. The two Telefonica units are Telefonica Moviles El Salvador and Telefonica Multiservicios, both of which operate under the Movistar brand and belong to Telefonica Centroamerica Inversiones. “If Claro complies with the conditions, it will be able to execute the purchase,” according to a statement from the antitrust agency, which added that it seeks to ensure market competition. In order to complete the acquisitions, Claro must rule out the future use of the portion of the spectrum currently used by Movistar, which must be certified by authorities. Once the acquisition is completed, Claro must also keep for seven years “all of the marketing strategies developed by Movistar and by Claro,” according to the SC statement, but noted that Claro could improve its pricing plans for consumers. America Movil said in a filing on Tuesday with Mexico’s main stock exchange it had been notified of the conditions and was analyzing the ruling.

Telecom operators globally are trying to balance the need for the Chinese company’s affordable and reliable equipment with the U.S. campaign to steer countries away from using its gear. “We think Huawei is an excellent provider,” said America Movil Chief Executive Daniel Hajj in response to questions on a conference call about moves to stop Huawei from doing business in some countries. But “there are other vendors we can use,” he added. As early as the 1990s, Huawei executives began pitching their services in Mexico. Competing aggressively on price and recruiting talent, Huawei eventually won big swaths of the market, supplying virtually all major players including the leader America Movil.

-31.80975847202997," Mexico's America Movil fined by regulator; calls it 'illegal and disproportionate' MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - America Movil, the telecoms giant controlled by the family of Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, said on Monday that one of its subsidiaries had been fined 1.3 billion pesos ($69.53 million) by Mexico’s telecoms regulator. The company decried the fine. The regulator, the Federal Telecommunications Institute (IFT), said in a statement that it fined the company for failing to share information about the availability of its telecom infrastructure, such as posts, with competitors. America Movil said the regulator’s action reflected a “lack of due process,” and it vowed to exercise “all legal remedies to challenge it.” “This arbitrary, illegal and disproportionate fine affects the legal certainty in a sector that requires important investments,” the company said in a statement. America Movil, which has long dominated Mexico’s telecoms market, is required to open its infrastructure to industry rivals in order to promote competition. But competitors grumble that they do not have sufficient access. The fine was levied against one of America Movil’s subsidiaries, Telefonos del Noroeste, known as Telnor, after the IFT found the unit had failed to share the necessary information as of September 2017. The penalty represents 6% of Telnor’s revenues. Sharing information about infrastructure puts competitors on more even footing and “promotes the development of competition in the telecommunications sector,” the IFT said in a statement. Sharing infrastructure among telecom companies can be a crucial way to extend coverage and bring down costs to consumers, said Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics. Despite America Movil’s protests, a $69 million fine is unlikely to change the company’s conduct, he said, due to its deep pockets. “Penalties of that amount, it’s like the cost of doing business,” he said. If the fine withstands legal challenges, it is not expected to affect America Movil’s consolidated financial results, analysts from Mexican bank Banorte wrote in a note to investors.

Under the agreement announced on Thursday, Telefonica will use AT&T’s wireless ‘last-mile’ equipment - the final link of telecom networks that delivers service to consumers through towers, antennas and fiber-optic cables. After a three-year transition period, Telefonica will see savings of 230 million euros ($254 million) per year, as well as a reduction in net debt of 500 million euros. Financial terms of the deal with AT&T were not disclosed. Analysts framed the deal as a lifeline for Telefonica in Mexico, where the company has long struggled to gain traction. Despite a 2013-14 reform intended to lessen its dominance, America Movil still holds nearly two-thirds of mobile lines in Mexico, according to data from telecoms regulator IFT. AT&T, too, has failed to significantly dent America Movil’s market share since it spent billions to enter the country in 2015 by buying two local carriers. The agreement will give both Telefonica and AT&T a boost in a brutally competitive market, said Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics. “It’s the two upstarts going up against the big guy,” Entner said. “You need to find all the friends that you can when someone has such a dominant position.” Telefonica Mexico Chief Executive Officer Camilo Aya told reporters the deal with AT&T was not exclusive, meaning the Spanish firm remains free to use other companies’ infrastructure. Telefonica will retain control over its operations, and its traffic will remain separate, he added. Aya said the agreement was part of a global trend to better position companies against rivals. “You need a lot of scale to compete in this business,” Aya said at an event in Mexico City. Telefonica has been outspoken about the difficulties it has faced in Mexico. Miguel Calderon, vice president of regulation at Telefonica Mexico, said the deal would ensure the firm remained in the country. The Spanish company has also complained about the cost of spectrum in Mexico, lobbying the government for a discount.

12.117344925775535," Telefonica teams up with AT&T in Mexico in new bid to take fight to Slim MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Spanish telecoms giant Telefonica has struck a deal to use some of U.S. rival AT&T’s infrastructure in Mexico, a move analysts said would better position both to compete with the market’s juggernaut, billionaire Carlos Slim’s America Movil. Under the agreement announced on Thursday, Telefonica will use AT&T’s wireless ‘last-mile’ equipment - the final link of telecom networks that delivers service to consumers through towers, antennas and fiber-optic cables. After a three-year transition period, Telefonica will see savings of 230 million euros ($254 million) per year, as well as a reduction in net debt of 500 million euros. Financial terms of the deal with AT&T were not disclosed. Analysts framed the deal as a lifeline for Telefonica in Mexico, where the company has long struggled to gain traction. Despite a 2013-14 reform intended to lessen its dominance, America Movil still holds nearly two-thirds of mobile lines in Mexico, according to data from telecoms regulator IFT. AT&T, too, has failed to significantly dent America Movil’s market share since it spent billions to enter the country in 2015 by buying two local carriers. The agreement will give both Telefonica and AT&T a boost in a brutally competitive market, said Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics. “It’s the two upstarts going up against the big guy,” Entner said. “You need to find all the friends that you can when someone has such a dominant position.” Telefonica Mexico Chief Executive Officer Camilo Aya told reporters the deal with AT&T was not exclusive, meaning the Spanish firm remains free to use other companies’ infrastructure. Telefonica will retain control over its operations, and its traffic will remain separate, he added. Aya said the agreement was part of a global trend to better position companies against rivals. “You need a lot of scale to compete in this business,” Aya said at an event in Mexico City. Telefonica has been outspoken about the difficulties it has faced in Mexico. Miguel Calderon, vice president of regulation at Telefonica Mexico, said the deal would ensure the firm remained in the country. The Spanish company has also complained about the cost of spectrum in Mexico, lobbying the government for a discount. After the deal with AT&T is complete, Telefonica will no longer need to pay for spectrum, driving down costs. Monica Aspe, vice president of external affairs for AT&T Mexico, described the accord as an innovative agreement between telecom companies. “What this agreement does is strengthen the ability to compete,” she said."

4.529389603013934," America Movil says open to discussing deal with Brazil's Oi MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - America Movil AMXL.MX, Mexico's largest telecommunications company, said on Wednesday it was open to discussing a deal with Oi SA OIBR4.SA, amid speculation that the Brazilian telecom carrier is in talks to sell its assets. “Of course we are interested in doing something with Oi in Brazil,” an America Movil executive said on the company’s third-quarter earnings call. Oi may consider selling its mobile operation if it gets attractive offers, Chief Operating Officer Rodrigo Abreu told Reuters earlier this month. America Movil, controlled by the family of Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, has moved to strengthen its presence in Latin America this year with a series of acquisitions. America Movil said on the call that it expected final regulatory approval of its deal to acquire rival Nextel’s operations in Brazil in November. The company’s executives added that a deal to acquire Telefonica’s assets in El Salvador is moving forward with regulators, who have requested additional information. In Mexico, America Movil’s top priority is receiving a license to offer pay TV, which it has been barred from providing since the early 1990s due to concerns about its market clout. That request, filed with Mexico’s Federal Telecommunications Institute last year, remains pending, America Movil said. Shares of America Movil rose as much as 4.5% on Wednesday, a day after it reported a 31% decline in third-quarter results. Analysts were encouraged by gains in service revenues and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), a closely watched measure of profitability."

The company controlled by the family of Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim posted total revenue of 248.43 billion pesos, up from 247.94 billion pesos in the year-ago quarter. The company said its results were hit by financing costs of 12.4 billion pesos stemming from the weakening of currencies in Argentina and Colombia against the dollar.

12.50596644849717," Billionaire Slim's telco bullish on coveted Mexico TV license MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - America Movil, the telecoms giant controlled by the family of billionaire Carlos Slim, is growing increasingly bullish that it will receive a license to offer television in Mexico, a prize that has eluded it for nearly three decades. America Movil offers TV in markets across Latin America, but the company has been barred from providing the service in its native Mexico since the privatization of state telecom firm Telmex in the early 1990s, which gave rise to the industry juggernaut. Last October, an America Movil subsidiary filed a request for a pay TV license with Mexico’s Federal Telecommunications Institute (IFT). While many feel the company’s share of the market is still too high, and the IFT has given no indication of the decision it will take, senior executives have expressed optimism in recent months that the matter will soon be resolved in their favor. “I think that we will soon hear a final definition from the ministry that will entail not if but when we will be able to begin the service,” America Movil Chief Financial Officer Carlos Garcia Moreno said at an event hosted by Goldman Sachs last week, according to a recording obtained by Reuters. Although Garcia Moreno alluded to the Ministry of Communications and Transportation (SCT), the decision will be taken by the IFT. An America Movil spokesman declined to comment on the recording. The remarks were previously published by Mexican newspaper El Universal. Before approving or rejecting the request, the regulator’s commissioners must vote on a recommendation from staff. Such a recommendation has not yet been received by the commissioners, a source in the regulator said. The company filed its request shortly after the victory of Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who has a long history of collaborating with Slim. While the decision rests with the IFT, an autonomous regulator, senior members of Lopez Obrador’s administration have previously told Reuters they are open to granting America Movil the license. Despite more consumers embracing streaming, America Movil is impatient to join its rivals in peddling triple-play packages that unite phone, internet and TV - with the company arguing the penetration of pay TV in Mexico is still low. If a license is issued, the Telmex network could be ready to offer TV to consumers within six months at most, a person close to Telmex said. The America Movil subsidiary plans to invest roughly 6.03 billion pesos ($305.95 million) to offer the service, according to a document filed by the SCT in November that was obtained by Reuters. But the company’s critics fear that handing America Movil a TV license will dash any hope of loosening its grip on the market. Five years after a telecom reform intended to promote competition, America Movil still holds nearly two thirds of mobile lines in Mexico, according to IFT data. “If (mobile unit) Telcel’s market share had dropped below 50%, I could clearly see... rewarding America Movil with a TV license,” said Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics. “But I don’t think (the market) is anywhere close to what the regulators were expecting.” By contrast, America Movil frames the pay TV license as a way to boost competition in a market where its arch rival Televisa is king. “The pay-TV market is highly concentrated... which indicates the urgency to generate competitive conditions,” America Movil said in a statement."

-7.023282119438552," América Móvil prepares for loan market return, seeks at least US$2.5bn NEW YORK, May 20 (LPC) - Mexico’s América Móvil is scouting lenders to refinance at least US$2.5bn in revolving credit facilities maturing this August, according to three banking sources, preparing a comeback to the Latin American bank market, where it has not issued debt since 2016. The telecommunications provider’s request for proposals (RFP) to lenders comes after fellow Mexican investment grade borrower, oil producer Petróleos Mexicanos (Pemex), last week launched an unprecedented US$8bn loan to handle its own looming debt maturities. América Móvil’s potential transaction, alongside Pemex’s jumbo financing, is a welcome shot in the arm for Latin American lenders, after a 44% slump in syndicated loan issuance to US$7.1bn in the first quarter of 2019 versus the year-ago period, according to data from LPC, a unit of Refinitiv. While Brazilian credits soaked up the bulk of available liquidity throughout the first quarter, Mexican lenders took time out to weigh what impact new President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s measures, including the cancellation of a US$13bn airport project and pushback on energy reforms, would have on the market before pressing ahead with billion-dollar sized deals. A series of smaller-sized loans for Mexican borrowers have kept bankers busy, but Pemex together with América Móvil present the first opportunity for big-ticket foreign currency corporate financing in Mexico this year, the three bankers said. The Carlos Slim-owned telecom, rated A3/A-/A-, has not tapped the dollar- or euro-denominated syndicated loan market in three years, according to LPC, but its status as a Latin American blue chip borrower is sufficient enough to garner demand at a favorable price. “América Móvil is the cream of the crop in Mexico,” said one of the three senior bankers. “Pricing will be so low, it’s going to be painful,” the banker said of the low spread over Libor, and minimal fees, that América Móvil typically commands. The company’s US$2bn-equivalent five-year loan in euros, signed in 2016, and its US$2.5bn five-year revolving credit facility from August 2014 paid just 45bp over Euribor and Libor, respectively. A new dollar deal is expected to offer similar spreads, sources said. “(Lenders) are listening to the biggest bond issuer in Mexico,” said a second banker of América Móvil, adding that a deal in the same window as Pemex brought “the (two) biggest issuers in Mexico” to market at the same time. Oil producer Pemex, rated Baa3/BBB+/BBB-, in comparison is expected to pay 235bp over Libor for a five-year bank facility. América Móvil has forged some of the strongest relationships with banks active in Latin America. As many as 20 lenders have been invited to participate in the refinancing, the sources said, and the company, known for its tough negotiation skills and dominance in the telecom space, is poised to extract strong demand. “(América Móvil) is number one or two in Latin America, they set the tone for what’s going on in the market,” said Sul Ahmad, an associate director for Fitch Ratings. The company, while absent from the bank market for three years, is also moving to deleverage. Adjusted debt to Ebitda is forecast to be below 2.5 times over the next 12-18 months, Moody’s Investors Service said in a report on April 15, from approximately 2.6 times at the end of 2016. The company also reported a first quarter net profit of roughly US$1bn in April, up 3.6% from the year-ago period. Despite its absence, however, the company has returned in force to the capital markets throughout 2019. Alongside an RFP to refinance bank debt, the company ended a five-year hiatus in the dollar-denominated bond market with a US$2.25bn transaction in April and announced plans this week to meet with investors about a potential euro-denominated bond sale. América Móvil also boosted its market share in March when it agreed to pay US$905m for Nextel Brazil from fellow mobile telecommunications provider NII Holdings and AI Brazil Holdings. “Their operating scale, diversification and deep pockets are all competitive advantages,” said Ahmad.

Striking an optimistic note about the year ahead, executives on Wednesday highlighted the company’s recent application for its first Mexican pay television license and forecast higher investments to grow its network. America Movil is controlled by the family of Slim, who was once the world’s richest man but whose fortune was diminished by increased competition after Mexican telecommunications reforms. In the last three months of 2018, Latin America’s largest telecommunications firm by number of subscribers narrowly beat the profit and revenue expectations of analysts surveyed in a Reuters poll. Investors were unimpressed, said James Salazar, an analyst with CI Banco, and America Movil shares sank to their lowest levels in more than a month before recovering somewhat to trade down 3.4 percent at 14.55 pesos. “The fact is that for all of 2018, revenue was flat,” he said. “It’s nothing spectacular.” Mexico’s benchmark S&P/BMV IPC stock index sank more than 1 percent, dragged down by America Movil, one of the most heavily weighted stocks on the index. The company on Tuesday reported a net profit of 10.7 billion pesos ($541.7 million) for the fourth quarter. In the same period a year earlier it reported a large loss, battered by currency fluctuations. Revenue of 262.3 billion pesos was down slightly from 263.9 billion pesos in the same quarter of 2017. Slim has been barred from offering cable television in Mexico since he created Telmex from the privatization of Mexico’s state-run telecommunications company in the early 1990s. He has wanted to overturn the ban for years. In December, Mexico’s telecom regulator IFT said an America Movil subsidiary had applied for a license to offer pay television in the country. America Movil Chief Executive Daniel Hajj publicly confirmed the application for the first time on a call with investors on Wednesday. If the IFT approves the request, America Movil could soon begin offering customers phone, internet and video services in one package, Hajj said. “We have the expertise in other countries,” he said. In addition, capital expenditures will increase, the company said on the call. Capital expenditures totaled $7.82 billion in 2018, according to the quarterly report, and will rise to $8.5 billion this year, focused on installing fiber, boosting wireless coverage and information technology, executives said."

7.926409561990004," America Movil fined $128 million by Mexican telecoms regulator MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - America Movil, the telecoms giant controlled by the family of Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, said on Thursday that it had been fined nearly $128 million by the country’s telecoms regulator, a decision it vowed to fight. In a notice to the Mexican stock exchange, America Movil said its Telmex subsidiary had been slapped with a fine of 2.54 billion pesos ($127.74 million) by Mexico’s Federal Telecommunications Institute (IFT). Telmex was penalized for allegedly failing to meet quality standards for the telecoms infrastructure it offered other companies in 2013 and 2014. America Movil and Telmex said they would exercise all legal avenues in challenging the fines. “This illegal and disproportionate fine affects the certainty and legal security in a sector that requires important investments for its development,” the companies said in the statement. A spokesman for America Movil and a spokeswoman for the telecoms regulator did not immediately respond to requests for comment. America Movil, which was created from a state monopoly, is Mexico’s largest telecoms operator by far. The infrastructure of Telmex, its fixed-line subsidiary, is critical for smaller players such as AT&T and Telefonica, which use it to transmit calls and data. In March, the telecoms regulator approved a plan to separate part of Telmex and Telnor, another fixed-line unit, into new companies. While America Movil has long been required to share its infrastructure, rivals have complained the access is insufficient."

The company, which is controlled by the family of Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, reported a net profit of 18.96 billion pesos ($1 billion) for the third quarter, rebounding from a loss in the same period last year when its results were battered by a Colombian arbitration panel ruling. But the net profit fell short of analysts’ expectations of 22.6 billion pesos, according to a poll conducted by Reuters. America Movil logged revenue of 248.07 billion pesos during the quarter. America Movil’s results have been hampered by currency swings in recent quarters, but foreign exchange rates played to the company’s favor this time. America Movil said in a report to investors that its results benefited from currency improvements in Mexico and Colombia following elections in those countries. Another driver of the company’s success was its campaign to shift its business from prepaid to more lucrative postpaid plans, in which users sign contracts. America Movil said it netted 1.1 million new postpaid subscribers during the quarter, up 7.6 percent from last year, expanding the base across its key markets. The company is also profiting as users consume more data. Data traffic soared 78.2 percent, spiking in Brazil, the United States and Mexico. America Movil’s EBITDA, a closely watched measure of profitability, reached 71.8 billion pesos, up 7.7 percent. In Mexico, America Movil’s home market which it has long dominated, EBITDA rose 15.2 percent, a jump the company attributed to cost-cutting.

-15.562103984105816," Slim's America Movil challenges Pemex contract awarded to Televisa group (In this Sept. 11 story corrects paragraph 2 to provide internet security services instead of provide internet) MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Billionaire Carlos Slim’s America Movil and Mexico’s state oil firm have become embroiled in a public fight over a government contract after the telecommunications giant filed complaints and a legal challenge, saying it unfairly lost the bid. A rival group, including a unit of Mexican broadcaster Grupo Televisa TLVACPO.MX, won a contract in June for nearly $36 million to provide internet security services to the oil company known as Pemex PEMX.UL. America Movil AMXL.MX had presented a cheaper offer of roughly $24.5 million, a company spokesman said, and went on to file complaints against Pemex. A Pemex spokesman said on Monday that the company expects to respond in several days but has not set an exact date. America Movil, Mexico’s largest internet carrier, and Televisa, the country’s biggest broadcaster, have clashed repeatedly in the Mexican market. An America Movil spokesman said Scitum, a subsidiary of the company’s Telmex unit, began filing complaints in June to Pemex’s internal auditors and audit committee. The company also filed a legal challenge asking that the contract award be suspended while the case is open. Telmex subsidiary Triara was also part of the America Movil group vying for the contract. The turmoil was first reported by Mexico’s Milenio newspaper late last month, making public the type of legal disputes over Mexico government contracts that are frequent but rarely rise to public attention. Pemex Chief Information Officer Rodrigo Becerra said in an interview that he was content with the tender awarded to Televisa and that Slim’s companies made mistakes in their bid. He added that when his team joined Pemex in 2016, it found an initial set of bidding requirements that could only have been met by one company, Scitum. “They had some irregularities. They were, we thought, tilted to one provider in particular,” he said. An America Movil spokesman denied that the company made mistakes and said that Pemex alone designed its bidding criteria. Televisa subsidiary Operbes won the internet bid in a consortium with information technology firm TI America. The companies said that technical qualifications outweighed price in winning the Pemex contract. “On occasion, some competitors present proposals that are apparently more competitive on price but do not meet the technological needs,” the companies said in a statement on Thursday. America Movil’s Telmex unit as well as Televisa both have substantial government contracting businesses, but neither breaks out those areas in detail. Mexican think tank IMCO, which studies public contracting, says that Mexican government tenders often lack competition and transparency and are riddled with irregularities."
-15.897139325308771," Carlos Slim sees no threat to Mexican business from leftist's election MADRID (Reuters) - Mexican tycoon Carlos Slim said on Tuesday he sees no risks to his telecoms-to-banking empire from the new left-wing government of Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, a self-styled radical who clashed with business leaders before his election this month. Slim, whose America Movil AMXL.MX owns Mexico's largest telecommunications network, said he had not met with Lopez Obrador, whose landslide victory put him on a path to take office on Dec. 1. Asked at an event in Madrid whether he thought Lopez Obrador, a social activist and economic nationalist, posed a risk to his business, Slim said, “No, risks, no.” “He is proposing, planning important investments before he has even started, which is unusual,” Slim said, singling out expected projects in trains, roads and energy. “Maybe he is looking to have a more sober and austere government, reducing costs substantially and focusing on the internal sector of the economy more.” Slim played down a tussle over plans to build a $13-billion airport for Mexico City, a project for which Slim’s companies hold lucrative contracts but which Lopez Obrador has rejected as a waste of taxpayer money. “It was a relative disagreement,” Slim said, adding the president-elect had proposed that the best option to finance the project might be through a concession. The group overseeing the airport’s construction said last week that four contract tenders had been suspended while Lopez Obrador decides on the project’s future. Slim called for more investment in Mexico and other Central American countries, suggesting that trade deals - such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), due for re-negotiation between the United States, Canada and Mexico - should include an investment pact. A lack of investment and job opportunities was the reason for migration from Mexico, which has prompted U.S. President Donald Trump to call for a border wall, Slim said. “The best wall is investment and creating opportunities in Mexico,” Slim said. “Mexicans don’t leave because they go to Disneyland or because they visit New York, they leave because they don’t find opportunities.”"
-15.901265809192209," America Movil says AT&T-Time Warner deal will not change Latam market MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The CEO of America Movil, Latin America’s largest telecommunications company by subscriber numbers, said on Wednesday that AT&T Inc’s acquisition of Time Warner will do little to change the telecoms landscape in the region. U.S. telecoms company AT&T closed its deal to buy media company Time Warner for $85 billion last month. “I don’t think it’s going to affect the market in Latin America,” America Movil Chief Executive Daniel Hajj said on a call discussing the company’s second-quarter results. “There’s going to be more production of content, and everybody is going to have access to all of the content.” America Movil, which is controlled by the family of Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, reported on Tuesday a 94-percent drop in net profit due to currency-related swings. But data revenue rose and the company added 1.1 million lucrative post-pay customers during the quarter, suggesting the fundamentals of the business are strong. On Brazil, one of America Movil’s most important markets, Hajj said the company is still evaluating whether to make a bid for Cemig Telecom, a unit of Brazilian utility Companhia Energetica de Minas Gerais . “(If) the price looks good for us, then I think we are going to do it,” Hajj said. “And if not, then we are going to step out.” The company also said it will focus more in the coming months on Chile, where its market share has been slipping. Hajj added that America Movil may challenge Chilean resolutions on telecoms, including a recent Supreme Court decision on spectrum, in international arbitration. The resolutions “create a lot of uncertainty for the future development and our future investments,” he said. In Mexico, America Movil is recovering from a landmark telecoms reform intended to lessen its dominance, but the regulatory landscape for the company appears to be improving. Hajj said he expects the administration of president-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who takes office on Dec. 1, to focus on improving coverage in rural areas. He added that he was hopeful that the company will soon obtain a license in Mexico to offer television, a service it has long been blocked from."
-15.901265809192209," America Movil's second-quarter net profit plummets on currency losses MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico’s America Movil, the largest telecommunications firm in Latin America by number of subscribers, saw its net profit slide 94 percent in the second quarter, hammered by currency-related swings. The company, which is controlled by the family of Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, posted a net profit of 818 million Mexican pesos ($41.2 million), down sharply from 14.3 billion pesos during the same quarter a year ago. Yet the company’s revenue rose to 257 billion pesos in the quarter from 249.4 billion pesos last year. America Movil said its performance was hurt by the U.S. dollar’s gains against the currencies of Mexico and Brazil, two of its key markets. Analysts had expected the company to log a net quarterly profit of 3.5 billion pesos, according to a Reuters poll, down from the same period last year, but a narrower loss than what was ultimately reported. Nevertheless, the company touted its rising data revenues for both pre- and post-pay customers, widely seen as the future of the business. The firm also added 1.1 million lucrative post-pay customers during the quarter. America Movil’s performance in its home country has suffered in recent years as Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto pushed through reforms intended to weaken the company’s dominance of the sector. But the company’s fortunes have improved as the administration’s tenure winds down. Pena Nieto will conclude a six-year term in November. Last August, the Mexican Supreme Court sided with America Movil that it should not be barred from charging competitors for use of its network, weakening a key plank of the reform. The telecoms minister of Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who takes office on Dec. 1, told Reuters he favors re-examining some regulations stemming from the reform, meaning the company may see more relief. America Movil’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), a closely watched measure of profitability, rose 14.9 percent in Mexico during the quarter, the sharpest increase in almost 11 years, the company said. There was good news for America Movil north of the border as well, as TracFone, its U.S. subsidiary, reported its service revenues returned to growth after recent declines."

4.66742847529196," RPT-FOCUS-Billionaire Slim, America Movil, could profit from election of Mexican leftist (Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text) MEXICO CITY, June 18 (Reuters) - Billionaire Carlos Slim has had harsh words for Mexico’s presidential frontrunner, saying recently he is “concerned and afraid” about what leftist Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador might do if elected. But a victory by Lopez Obrador, who holds a double-digit lead in most polls before the July 1 vote, could provide upside for Slim’s fortunes, particularly with regard to his America Movil telecommunications empire, Reuters interviews with a dozen close friends, partners and other people familiar with their dealings show. Lopez Obrador’s pick for telecoms minister, Javier Jimenez, told Reuters he favors re-examining some regulations stemming from Mexico’s landmark 2014 telecommunications reform, a law that has clipped America Movil’s profits and inhibited its expansion. That is because Slim’s company, which possesses the largest network in Mexico, could play a key role in delivering cell coverage to rural areas but complains current regulations hold it back. Lopez Obrador has championed better connectivity for the nation’s impoverished farmers and indigenous people, who are some of his strongest supporters. “We have to define a policy so that within six years there is the possibility of 5G across the whole country,” said Jimenez, who went to college with Slim and has known him for some 60 years. He emphasized that all players would be invited to take part. Jimenez said such a shift could include reviewing criteria for evaluating “preponderance.” That concept in the telecoms law triggers tougher regulation for players with more than 50 percent market share. America Movil still accounts for more than 60 percent of Mexico’s fixed lines and mobile users. America Movil executives have complained publicly the company is hamstrung from entering underserved areas because that would only increase its market share, prolonging antitrust scrutiny. Jimenez said the country’s reform is behind on its mandate to expand access. He said a Lopez Obrador administration would not seek to modify the overall reform, which created an independent regulator, but would conduct a review of secondary regulations to ensure competition is not coming at the expense of coverage. “There shouldn’t be competition for competition’s sake,” Jimenez said. “Competition is an element, a tool, that permits a larger goal, which is better attention to the user.” There could be even more good news for Slim. Jimenez and another Lopez Obrador adviser, telecoms veteran Abel Hibert, said they were open to the idea of granting America Movil a television license, a sector the company has long been denied entry because of its size and influence. Such a move would be up to regulators. But if it came to pass, it would allow America Movil to achieve its dream of offering customers phone service, internet and video in one package, and, Jimenez said, could help serve far-flung consumers. Changes to Mexico’s telecoms landscape would come with high stakes. The reform, which required a constitutional amendment, enjoys broad public support. Rates fell, service improved and consumers have more choices. U.S.-based AT&T Inc invested heavily to grab a share of a market with an estimated 114 million cell subscriptions. Many are wary of softening measures against Slim, whose company has waged numerous court battles to stymie the legislation and maintain its power. “If we let down our guard, America Movil will only get stronger,” said Senator Gerardo Flores, whose Partido Verde helped pass the reform. A spokesman for America Movil declined to comment, as did a spokeswoman for Lopez Obrador. The prospect of Lopez Obrador, a social activist and economic nationalist, as president has spooked some leading Mexican businesspeople. Yet pragmatism has marked the relationship between the austere politician and Slim, Mexico’s richest man. The pair tussled recently over a proposed $13-billion airport for Mexico City. Lopez Obrador decried it as a waste of taxpayers’ money. Slim called a rare press conference to defend the project, for which his construction companies hold lucrative contracts. But the controversy faded quickly. Lopez Obrador subsequently said that, if elected, he would consider allowing the private sector to finance the airport, alleviating the need for public money - a solution Slim himself had proposed. Practicality likewise prevailed in the early 2000s, when Lopez Obrador was Mexico City mayor, and he and Slim teamed up to revitalize the decrepit historic center. They clashed early. Slim regularly attended the meetings, but while he was out undergoing a medical procedure, Lopez Obrador’s team attempted to make major changes, two people familiar with the project said. Rather than feuding, Slim suggested the men divvy up responsibilities. The project was ultimately a success. Slim saw the value of his downtown real estate holdings soar, while Lopez Obrador positioned himself for national office. “Slim doesn’t consider Lopez Obrador his ideal leader, and Lopez Obrador doesn’t consider Slim his ideal businessperson,” said James Jones, a former U.S. ambassador to Mexico who knows both men. “But I think they can work together.” Telecommunications could provide another avenue for the men to help each other get what they want. Mexico’s telecoms reform was a rude awakening for Slim, who acquired the former state-owned Telmex phone monopoly in the 1990s and has dominated the nation’s industry ever since. The legislation aimed at loosening America Movil’s grip. The company was forced to share its network with competitors and initially was banned from charging interconnection fees. The company saw its Mexican profit margins fall to less than 35 percent from 45 percent in just a few years. Consumers, meanwhile, rejoiced as rates fell by roughly 40 percent. But more than a third of Mexicans still lack a mobile subscription, behind countries such as Argentina and Brazil, according to estimates from trade group GSMA Intelligence. Millions live in areas without coverage. Reaching those Mexicans would be a top priority for Lopez Obrador, adviser Jimenez said. Noting that companies favor profitable urban areas, he said the administration would entice them to invest in less lucrative rural zones. He did not provide specifics. Some telecoms experts say Mexico’s regulations could potentially be tweaked so not all rural subscribers count toward America Movil’s market share, though there is some debate about how much flexibility the constitution allows. Slim already has weakened one major plank of the reform, persuading the Supreme Court in August to overturn a provision that had forced America Movil to let rivals use its network for free. To be sure, Lopez Obrador’s influence would have limits. The reform created an independent regulator, the Federal Telecommunications Institute (IFT), which oversees competition. But Lopez Obrador could shape the regulator over time: The next president will name four of seven commissioners. Jimenez stressed he would respect the IFT’s autonomy and work collaboratively to chart the right course. Nevertheless, many in telecoms are convinced a victory by Lopez Obrador would be a win for Slim as well. When the men were sparring over the airport, “I found it more like a sort of charade,” said Ernesto Piedras of research firm CIU in Mexico City. “There’s been a very long period of them being close and collaborative for political and economic purposes.”"

4.4565801284810185," America Movil to launch new U.S. unit for business clients MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican telecommunications company America Movil, controlled by the family of Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, is launching a U.S.-based unit that will offer information technology and communications to business customers, according to a source and a document on the company’s website. America Movil is rolling out Claro Enterprise Solutions and will integrate its existing Telmex USA subsidiary into Claro, according to the Telmex USA website. Based in Florida, the new company will serve a range of businesses “from small companies to large multinationals,” the document says. The company plans to “rapidly expand its product portfolio” and will have locations across the United States, according to the document. A spokesman for America Movil declined to comment. In the document, the company said the move expands its global footprint and commitment to innovation. America Movil has built up a robust presence in the United States through TracFone, a mobile virtual network operator that rents capacity from other operators. The company had 23.1 million subscribers in the United States at the end of 2017, according to America Movil’s fourth quarter earnings report."
-7.286124722839888," America Movil still wants TV license in Mexico, CEO says MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - America Movil AMXL.MX remains interested in offering television in Mexico and continues discussing the possibility of obtaining a license with the telecommunications regulator, Chief Executive Daniel Hajj said on a call with analysts on Wednesday. America Movil, which is controlled by the family of Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, has been barred from offering television in Mexico since Telmex’s privatization in the early 1990s. Mexico’s telecommunications regulator, the Federal Telecommunications Institute (IFT), has said that the company will be eligible to apply for a TV license once it complies with the measures it is subject to due to its high market share in the country. The TV license could help America Movil better compete as companies increasingly seek to offer their customers voice, data and video in one package. “It’s the only place in the world that we are not allowed to have TV, so I hope they understand and that they can give us a TV license,” Hajj said. America Movil reported its first-quarter earnings on Tuesday, registering a 50 percent drop in net profit due to currency swings. But analysts said the fundamentals of the business were strong, particularly in Mexico, where mobile revenue surged 12.8 percent. The quarter marked the first time America Movil has been able to charge competitors interconnection fees since Mexico’s landmark telecommunications reform forced the company to let rivals use its network for free. The Supreme Court opened the door for America Movil to resume charging competitors in August, and the IFT set the fees, permitting the company to bill about a fourth of what its rivals can. But the fees accounted for just a fraction of the growth in mobile revenues in Mexico during the quarter, Hajj said. “The growth is because people are using more data and we have more customers,” he said. Stronger demand for data has helped America Movil’s average revenue per user in Mexico recover from the price war touched off by the telecom reform, Hajj said. Mexico is preparing to auction spectrum in the 2500-2690 MHz band, which has drawn strong interest from operators because it is well suited for broadband, 5g mobile networks and the so-called Internet of Things. But America Movil will sit out the auction because it already has spectrum in the band and the IFT put limits on its participation, Hajj said. “If we don’t have equal conditions, we are not so enthusiastic,” Hajj said."
-7.286124722839888," America Movil first-quarter profit dives on currency swings MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - America Movil said on Tuesday its net profit fell nearly 50 percent in the first quarter due to currency swings, but there were signs Latin America’s largest wireless carrier was already reaping the rewards of an important Supreme Court decision in Mexico. The telecommunications company, which is controlled by the family of Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim, posted a net profit of 18.087 billion pesos ($988 million), compared with 35.85 billion pesos in the same quarter a year earlier. America Movil attributed a decline in sales to the peso’s appreciation against other currencies. A strong peso means revenue from other countries is worth less when translated into Mexican currency. If not for foreign exchange fluctuations, revenue would have risen narrowly, the company said. The company said growth in Mexico outpaced other markets, and that it had resumed charging competitors such as AT&T T.N and Telefonica TEF.MC to use its network in Mexico. “The regulatory and competitive pressures have eased up a bit,” said Intercam analyst Alik Garcia. Mexico’s 2013-14 telecommunications reform forced America Movil to let competitors use its network for free, which was a drag on the company’s profits. After a protracted legal battle, Mexico’s Supreme Court opened the door for America Movil to resume charging competitors in August, and telecommunications regulators set the new interconnection fees in November, permitting the company to bill about a fourth of what its rivals can. America Movil’s rivals, who competed to offer the best packages after reform, appear to be acting more conservatively in the new regulatory environment, Garcia said. For the first quarter, the company’s earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) margin, a measure of profitability, was 28 percent, the best in 10 quarters. While interconnection fees in Mexico helped, they were not the only factor, said GBM analyst Carlos de Legarreta. The company’s average revenue per user for mobile rose 11.6 percent in Mexico and 10.7 percent in Brazil, its two most important markets. “This means they are monetizing the demand for data that we are seeing across Latin America,” de Legarreta said."

-8.417739727728588," UPDATE 1-Rebranding write-downs wipe out Telekom Austria net profit (Adds detail, background) VIENNA, April 24 (Reuters) - First-quarter net profit at Telekom Austria, a unit of Mexican tycoon Carlos Slim’s America Movil, shrank by three quarters because of amortisation prompted by a rebranding effort, the company said on Tuesday. Beyond its home market, Telekom Austria operates in four countries in the former Yugoslavia, plus Bulgaria and Belarus. It is gradually changing its local brand name to A1 in various countries, which prompted brand value amortisation of 101.1 million euros ($124 million) in the first three months of the year. The rebranding will weigh on profits until 2019 and more than half the impact has now been accounted for, it said. That amortisation, which was driven by Bulgaria and to a lesser extent Belarus, Croatia and Macedonia, meant net profit in the three months through March fell 75 percent to 24.5 million euros compared with the same period a year earlier. Revenue grew 1.2 percent, in line with its guidance of an increase of 1-2 percent this year, which it said remained unchanged. Earnings before interest, tax depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) rose 0.2 percent. Telekom announced last week that T-Systems executive Thomas Arnoldner will replace Alejandro Plater as chief executive in September, but it gave no indication on Tuesday of whether its strategy might change when he takes over.

-12.861302166270802," Mexico's top court sides with America Movil, says Telmex can charge rivals MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - America Movil’s fixed-line unit Telmex said on Wednesday that the nation’s supreme court has sided with it and ruled the firm should not be barred from charging rivals for calls to its network. The decision follows a similar ruling from the Supreme Court in August that opened the door for America Movil’s mobile unit Telcel to begin charging its rivals for use of its network. The rulings weaken a key pillar of a 2014 telecommunications reform intended to loosen billionaire Carlos Slim’s grip on a market he has dominated since taking control of former state phone monopoly Telmex in the 1990s. Mexico’s Federal Institute of Telecommunications (IFT) will set the rates, which will become effective on Jan. 1, 2019, Telmex said. A spokeswoman for the IFT did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The IFT ruled in November that America Movil could resume charging local rivals for mobile calls to its network. In March, the IFT approved a plan to separate part of America Movil’s fixed-line units into new companies, after about a year of discussion. America Movil submitted a plan for the separation this month, which is intended to open up its infrastructure to competitors. Telmex held about 62 percent of Mexico’s fixed-lines as of the third quarter 2017, according to IFT data."

The IFT said it fined America Movil and Telcel for having “exclusivity agreements with Blue Label Mexico, which prevented the company from marketing or providing” services for Telcel’s competitors in the mobile telephone service. Blue Label provides technical and banking support to retail businesses in Mexico, according to the company’s LinkedIn page. “We have already received the notification from the IFT. We are analyzing the document and in due time we will present the challenge in accordance with law,” an America Movil spokesman said. Blue Label did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
