6.232678470569223," Governments from Mongolia to Mali seek to reopen mining deals TORONTO/JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Some resource-rich developing countries are seeking to rewrite mining contracts and accelerate dividend payouts, which can take years to materialize under deals that experts said are tilted in companies’ favor. Any move to renegotiate agreements will trigger pushback by miners wary of threats to their profit margins, experts said, and previous attempts have caused protracted disputes. Mongolia became the latest country to demand better terms, asking for more tax revenue from Rio Tinto’s Oyu Tolgoi copper-gold mine while it waits for dividends. In West Africa, Mali has said it would try to reopen mining contracts that leave the state waiting years for dividend payments. “What we’re asking for today is for African countries to be able to benefit more from their mineral production,” said Abdoulaye Pona, president of Mali’s Chamber of Mines. The historical power imbalance between mineral-rich but cash-poor countries and multinational mining companies has left a legacy of bad deals that have been overly generous to investors, said Alexandra Readhead, tax and extractives lead at the International Institute for Sustainable Development. The financial strain governments are under from the COVID-19 pandemic could lead to stricter implementation of existing tax laws and closer scrutiny of deals, Readhead said. Governments are pushing for speedier payouts as prices for metals from gold to copper scale multiyear highs, signaling what investment bankers said is the start of another commodity supercycle. Glencore remains at odds with the Democratic Republic of Congo nearly three years after the country signed a new mining code into law, CEO Ivan Glasenberg said on Tuesday. The 2018 code hiked royalties on cobalt, copper and gold. “We are still in discussions with the government... we have not accepted the change from the old code to the new code,” Glasenberg told investors on a call. ‘NOT LIKELY TO CHANGE’ Mongolia, which owns 34% of the Oyu Tolgoi mine, is unlikely to get dividends until 2051 based on Rio’s latest cost estimate for an underground expansion, a source familiar with negotiations said. Delays and rising costs have eroded the expected benefits of the project, the state argued. Rio, whose majority-owned Turquoise Hill Resources owns the rest of the mine, declined to comment. Some are skeptical Mongolia’s government will win better terms under a new pact, given that previous agreements limit its taxation powers. “It’s not likely to change to their benefit,” said Vincent Kiezebrink at the Netherlands-based Centre for Research on Multinational Corporations. In Mali, the transitional government is reviewing mining deals after the auditor general last year identified problems including “non-distribution of dividends” in the contracts. In September, Barrick Gold unit SOMILO paid its first dividend to Mali, 15 years after production at the Loulo mine started and a year after the auditor general criticised the firm for not paying dividends. Barrick did not respond to questions. The Loulo mine is part of the Loulo-Gounkoto gold-mining complex, West Africa’s biggest, and Barrick said the project generated $240 million in dividends for 2020. CEO Mark Bristow has said he does not expect major changes to mining deals in Mali. Last year Mali’s auditor general demanded Resolute Mining pay dividends to the state, a 20% shareholder in the Syama mine which started producing in late 2008. Resolute’s Mali subsidiary SOMISY will begin paying dividends to the government once it reaches profitability, the company told Reuters. While pushing for reforms, countries in need of investment must still tread carefully, Pona at Mali’s Chamber of Mines said. “You can’t create a (mining) code which will make mining companies avoid your country,” he said."
8.322412546142955," Rio Tinto hands back cash on profit beat, record iron ore MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Rio Tinto on Wednesday reported its best annual earnings since 2011 and declared a record dividend payout, the second major iron ore producer to return windfalls to investors after unprecedented prices and demand for the steel ingredient. Chinese infrastructure spending has sucked in record imports of iron ore and on Tuesday Rio’s industry peer BHP also surprised investors with fatter-than-expected returns. “We have earned a lot of money last year,” said CEO Jakob Stausholm, who moved into the top job last month. “But we have also done a lot of deleveraging in the year and we are down to now having less than $1 billion of net debt. So it’s difficult to argue that we should hold back on dividends,” Stausholm told a media briefing. Underlying earnings rose to $12.45 billion from $10.37 billion a year earlier, beating analysts’ estimates of $12.02 billion, Refinitiv IBES data showed. China’s focus on infrastructure last year drove a more than 50% rise in the price of iron ore, which reached a record in December on China’s Dalian Commodity Exchange. Miners are also expected to benefit from an expected rebound in the global economy from the rollout of COVID-19 vaccines. Brenton Saunders, a portfolio manager at Pendal Group, said it was a solid result with a big beat on dividend expectations. “Let’s not kid ourselves, the biggest part of this result is still strong commodity prices,” Saunders said. Costs are in check and Rio is paying out a lot of what it is making compared to the peak of the last commodity cycle, he added. Rio’s half-year dividend plus special dividend was $6.5 billion compared with BHP’s $5.1 billion payout. Fortescue Metals Group Ltd reports on Thursday. Rio declared a record final dividend of $3.09 per share, up from $2.31 in 2019, and announced a special dividend payout of 93 cents a share. The peak of the last commodity cycle a decade ago was marked by cost overruns at global miners and over-payments for poor assets that were later followed by multi-billion dollar writedowns. Stausholm told investors he was convinced Rio would find solutions in talks with the Mongolian government, which is seeking more tax revenue from the expansion of Rio’s massive Oyu Tolgoi copper-gold mine. On Rio’s Simandou iron ore project in Guinea, Stausholm said the company would not make a big investment decision this year. Rio still needs to mend ties with the Aboriginal group whose sacred rock shelters it destroyed for an iron ore mine last year, and there is no timeline for that, said Stausholm, who visited Juukan Gorge last week. The miner has removed 54 million dry tonnes of iron ore from its reserves after a review of important Aboriginal sites. Stausholm also did not rule out board changes at its London annual general meeting in April after investors were disappointed with the findings of a board-led review into the destruction. Chairman Simon Thompson commissioned the review and independent director Michael L’Estrange delivered it. “In terms of who will stand for election at the AGM, that will come out in early March so I can’t comment on that at this time,” Stausholm said. To improve its green credentials, Rio has also set new scope 3 targets to lower the emissions of its customers, primarily the steel industry, following the example of BHP and Glencore. It said it would put the goal to an advisory vote at its 2022 AGM. The board’s remuneration committee has added climate change to short-term incentive plans."

8.211165733029434," Rio Tinto, two others sign deal to explore low-carbon iron in Canada (Reuters) - Rio Tinto has agreed to explore production of a low-carbon steel feedstock in Canada, the global miner said on Tuesday, as part of its strategy to reduce carbon emissions. The miner said it has signed a memorandum of understanding with Luxembourg-based engineering firm Paul Wurth S.A. and German steelmaker SHS-Stahl-Holding-Saar GmbH & Co. KGaA. (bit.ly/3qrq4VE) The companies will explore the viability of transforming iron ore pellets into low-carbon hot briquetted iron (HBI), a low-carbon steel feedstock, using green hydrogen generated from hydro-electricity in Canada, Rio said. Iron Ore Company of Canada (IOC), in which Rio holds a majority stake, will supply high-grade iron ore for the project, with a feasibility study for potential industrial scale low-carbon iron production scheduled to be completed in late 2021. As a part of Rio’s climate strategy, the partnership will “support the development and deployment of low-carbon technologies for hard-to-abate processes like steelmaking,” IOC President and Chief Executive Clayton Walker said. Last December, Rio unveiled plans to invest $10 million in low-carbon steelmaking projects over the next two years in an effort to fight climate change along with China Baowu Steel Group."
21.413650556441898," UPDATE 2-Mongolia seeks more tax revenue from Rio copper mine expansion -source (Adds details) TORONTO, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Mongolia wants more tax revenue under a revised deal to expand Rio Tinto’s Oyu Tolgoi copper-gold mine rather than a larger ownership stake in the project, a person with direct knowledge of the government’s thinking told Reuters on Monday, as the two sides bid to resolve a long-running standoff over the development. On Sunday, the Financial Times reported Ulaanbaatar is seeking agreement with Rio to terminate a deal to expand the mine and replace it with a new pact that offers better terms. “We obviously would like to have more tax revenues,” the person said, declining to be identified owing to the sensitivity of the issue. The mine is one of the world’s largest-known copper and gold deposits. The government holds a 34% stake in the $6.75 billion project, while Rio Tinto-controlled Turquoise Hill owns the rest. Ulaanbaatar has previously told Rio it was concerned that the economic benefits of developing the mine have been eroded due to the significant increase in costs. Under current plans, Ulaanbaatar won’t receive dividends until 2051 while Oyu Tolgoi won’t pay “meaningful” corporate income tax, the person said. “That’s really concerning.” Rio did not immediately return a request for comment. The miner on its website says Oyu Tolgoi has paid the government more than $2.7 billion in taxes, fees and other payments since 2010. The source said government representatives met last week with Bold Baatar, a Mongolian national whose recent appointment as head of Rio’s copper operations is widely seen as an attempt to improve government relations and make progress in talks on the project. Baatar has vowed to discuss the plans with the new government and work towards a resolution. The underground expansion will push annual production to nearly 500,000 tonnes per year, making it among the world’s biggest copper mines.

21.413650556441898," Mongolia seeking pact with Rio Tinto to replace copper mine expansion plan: FT (Reuters) - Mongolia’s government is seeking to cancel a deal with miner Rio Tinto to expand the Oyu Tolgoi copper mine in the Gobi Desert and replace it with a new agreement, the Financial Times reported. The government has asked the Anglo-Australian mining giant whether it was prepared to mutually terminate the existing expansion plan and come to a new agreement that offers better terms for the project, rather than acting unilaterally and risking future foreign investment, the FT said. It cited unnamed sources with knowledge of the situation. Rio Tinto declined to comment on the matter when contacted by Reuters. The mine is one of the world’s largest-known copper and gold deposits. The government holds a 34% stake in the $6.75 billion project, while Rio Tinto-controlled Turquoise Hill owns the remainder. The underground mine expansion has been severely delayed by a dispute over funding as the Mongolian government seeks a bigger portion of the profits, even as costs have ballooned due to difficult geology. Ulaanbaatar has previously told the miner it was concerned that the economic benefits of developing the mine have been eroded due to the significant increase in costs. The recent appointment of a Mongolian national, Bold Baatar, as Rio’s chief executive of copper operations, is widely seen as an attempt by the miner to improve its relationship with the government and progress talks on the project. Baatar has vowed to discuss the plans with the new government and work towards a resolution.

17.64037920799523," Rio Tinto board could face pressure on Indigenous broken promise claim MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Rio Tinto chairman Simon Thompson is set to face further pressure over the board’s handling of the destruction of sacred rock shelters in Australia after an Indigenous group accused him of breaking a personal promise, analysts said. The traditional owners of the rock shelters said Thompson had told them Rio’s acting head of iron ore, Ivan Vella, who had led reconciliation efforts, would see the process through to its end, The Australian newspaper reported on Thursday, citing a letter to Rio from the traditional owners. Rio announced last week that Vella would move to Canada to head up its aluminium business, while Chief Commercial Officer Simon Trott would take charge of iron ore. The Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP) had told Rio of their concerns that frequent leadership turnover prevented the groups building longstanding relationships of trust, the newspaper said. The destruction last year of the 46,000-year-old Juukan Gorge rock shelters, while legal, sparked a public and investor uproar that led to the resignation of then CEO Jean-Sebastien Jacques and two deputies, and a promise by Rio Tinto to repair ties. Thompson is likely to face increasing pressure to step down, given the recent spotlight on social issues that is worrying investors, even with solid financial results, said David Lennox of Fat Prophets in Sydney which holds Rio shares. “The institutional shareholders are starting to get a greater whiff of the responsibilities of being a shareholder. In the past, they didn’t care. Those days are long gone,” he said. In the letter to Rio, acting PKKP Aboriginal Corp Chief Executive Grant Wilson said the group had explicitly asked Thompson to clarify who would be responsible for mending the relationship, following the destruction of the shelters to extend iron ore mining, The Australian said. “Mr Thompson was unequivocal in his response; Ivan Vella was nominated as having full board imprimatur for repairing the relationship from a Rio Tinto perspective. This responsibility was to have lasted from that meeting through to the conclusion of the repair,” the letter said. Shareholder advocacy group the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility said the latest move by the global miner suggested “that Rio still views its relationship with traditional owners as ‘an afterthought’.” “ACCR believes that investors should hold Thompson and other board members accountable, and insist on necessary, constructive change to the company’s board composition,” it said in a statement. Rio is due to hold its London annual general meeting in April and its Australian AGM in May. “The empty ‘trust’ bucket just got knocked over by the chairman ... it is becoming increasingly clear that changes need to be made at the board level,” said analyst Peter O’Connor at broker Shaw and Partners in Sydney. The PKKP said it only found out about the recent leadership changes through the media, and that Thompson had not made any formal contact to explain the changes and their impact on the reconciliation process, the paper said. The PKKP told Reuters through a spokesman it had been in contact with Rio Tinto recently but declined to comment on the specific nature of any correspondence or discussions. Asked for comment on the report, Rio Tinto said rebuilding trust with the PKKP remained a “priority”, and that it was appropriate the relationship be led by the head of iron ore. “We are encouraged by the progress on the planning for the remediation of the Juukan Gorge area but readily acknowledge we have a lot more work ahead of us,” it said in a statement.

17.64037920799523," Turquoise Hill gets interim relief in funding spat with Rio for Mongolia mine (Reuters) - Canada’s Turquoise Hill said on Thursday it has received temporary relief in the arbitration proceedings against Rio Tinto, related to the proposed funding of the Oyu Tolgoi mine. As a result of the order, Rio Tinto may not use the parties’ existing contractual arrangements to restrict Turquoise Hill from engaging on funding and other matters with its fellow stakeholders in the mine, the Canadian miner said. Oyu Tolgoi is one of the world’s largest-known copper and gold deposits, located in the South Gobi region of Mongolia. The Mongolian government holds a 34% stake in the project with Rio’s majority-owned Turquoise Hill owning the rest. Until further order, Rio Tinto may also not authorize re-profiling negotiations with project lenders in a manner that would render Oyu Tolgoi LLC unable to execute an offering of bonds in 2021, Turquoise added. Tensions between mine operator Rio and Turquoise Hill’s management and minority shareholders have spilled into the open in recent months. Rio owns 51% of Turquoise, which in turn owns 66% of the mine. Turquoise Hill in November launched arbitration proceedings against Rio, saying the miner’s approach to funding the expansion is “incompatible” with its own. It had in January sought an interim order in its arbitration."
17.64037920799523," Fortescue pays royalties to Aboriginal group, a year late MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia’s Fortescue Metals has pledged to pay nearly A$2 million ($1.4 million) in outstanding royalties to an Aboriginal partner, around a year after they were initially due, a spokesman for the group said on Thursday. The A$1.9 million figure represents full payments for 2019 and comes amid a growing spotlight on miners’ relationships with Indigenous people, following peer Rio Tinto’s destruction of ancient, sacred caves last year. The Wintawari Guruma Aboriginal Corporation (WGAC) on Wednesday received a letter from Fortescue Chief Operating Officer Greg Lilleyman confirming the payment and expected to receive it “in the next few days”, a spokesman told Reuters. It was still waiting to hear however, whether 2020 payments, due this month, would be paid, he added. Fortescue confirmed the “good faith” payment while discussions of heritage approvals at the Queen’s Valley project in Western Australia continue, but did not comment on whether it would pay the 2020 royalties this month. The miner is expected to report record half year profits at more than $4 billion later this month amid soaring prices for iron ore, used in steel-making. Fortescue’s Solomon Hub, which has production capacity of 75 million tonnes per annum, lies on ancestral land of the Eastern Guruma - or Wintawari Guruma - people, along with some 90 kilometres of its Eliwana railway. The WGAC has said it estimates at least 434 heritage sites have been destroyed through mining, while 285 more are close to mining operations and inaccessible to traditional owners. The miner says WGAC is contractually obliged to approve the leases. “It is only the failure to comply with this contractual obligation over a prolonged period that resulted in Fortescue taking the decision to temporarily withhold calendar year 2019 compensation payments,” it told a government inquiry last year. However, WGAC director Joselyn Hicks told the same inquiry that WGAC had asked for more information on Fortescue’s mining plans before it approves the leases, since the areas contain numerous sacred sites."

16.703336639950066," UPDATE 1-Rio Tinto reshuffles top deck as it strives to mend Indigenous ties (Recasts and updates throughout with more detail, activist investor comment) MELBOURNE, Jan 28 (Reuters) - Rio Tinto on Thursday named a new head of its iron ore division as part of a leadership reshuffle as it works to rebuild partnerships with Indigenous groups after the global miner destroyed ancient, sacred caves in Australia. Global Chief Executive Jakob Stausholm, who was appointed in December after several executives left in response to the caves blast in May, has vowed to take a more inclusive approach and repair relationships with Aboriginal groups. Chief Commercial Officer Simon Trott will head the Australian iron ore business, the company said, moving back to Western Australia from Singapore where he ran the company’s marketing division. Iron ore makes up nearly 80% of Rio’s total underlying earnings. Arnaud Soirat, head of Rio’s copper & diamonds business, was appointed to the newly created role of chief operating officer for a fixed 18-month term before he retires. Rio also on Thursday named long-time executive Kellie Parker as chief executive, Australia, with a remit to “focus on rebuilding trust and strengthening external relationships across Australia.” Rio’s destruction of two rock shelters in the Juukan Gorge, one of which showed evidence of continual human habitation dating back 46,000 years, was legal but deeply distressed the traditional owners and led to a public outcry. Some investors were unimpressed with Rio’s initial board-led review into the incident because it failed to find any single person accountable. “Deep cultural change is needed at Rio Tinto,” said Brynn O’Brien, executive director of the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR). “Shareholder reservations about board competency remain, and we expect that investors will be looking to the company’s AGM in May as an opportunity for renewal.” Investors will also be monitoring how the new leadership team manages issues at its Resolution Copper project in Arizona, which encompasses sites sacred to the Apache people, and legacy pollution from a copper mine in Bougainville, ACCR said. Rio said it will retain the current four product groups in Australia - aluminium, copper, iron ore, and minerals - and appointed separate heads for each unit.

10.655641706533048," Breakingviews - New Rio Tinto boss has Mongolian bullet to bite LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Jakob Stausholm will have to pick up a travel guide to Ulaanbaatar. Rio Tinto’s new chief executive has a challenging to-do list and atop it sits the miner’s troubled $10 billion Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold project, located 700 kilometres from the Mongolian capital. Trying to satisfy all the interested parties at once is probably a fool’s errand. It’s surprising the whole sticky mess, along with the high tensions between Australia and China and Rio’s frayed relations with indigenous peoples, didn’t dissuade Stausholm from taking the job. Turquoise Hill Resources, the Canadian-listed company that owns two-thirds of Oyu Tolgoi, lost a fifth of its market value on Jan. 11 after suggestions that the Mongolian government might not continue with the project. Shares of Turquoise, in which Rio holds a 51% stake, have tumbled by two-thirds since 2016. Oyu Tolgoi should be a real asset. It is expected to churn out 500,000 tonnes of copper annually later this decade. That would make it the world’s fourth biggest producer. And prices for the red metal have soared 70% since March and should stay high as demand for electricity, and therefore copper wiring, soars. The project, however, is hamstrung by a rickety corporate structure and a major funding problem. Big digs typically involve private-sector entities owning the equity, with generous annual royalties paid to the host state’s exchequer. Aside from Rio, Oyu Tolgoi has three main stakeholders: the state, the non-Mongolian minority shareholders who own 49% of Turquoise, and Odey Asset Management, a pushy British hedge fund that is a Rio investor and has a short position in Turquoise. Ulaanbaatar holds 34% of Oyu Tolgoi LLC, and Turquoise owns the rest. The main headache is that Mongolia, with a GDP of just $14 billion and limited cash, has long funded its portion of the project’s capital investment with loans from Turquoise. It represents a big chunk of the $7 billion advanced to Oyu Tolgoi over the last decade, according to company disclosures, at an annual interest rate of 6.5 percentage points above the London Interbank Offered Rate. It also borrowed another $1.3 billion from Turquoise to finance its Oyu Tolgoi share purchases. This all must be repaid before Mongolia can receive dividends. Even if the project had been on time and budget, Ulaanbaatar would have faced a long wait. As it is, the project costs recently jumped sharply to $6.75 billion, so any payouts could take decades. Unsurprisingly, that’s causing a political stink in Mongolia. Meanwhile, Turquoise faces a funding gap of at least $3 billion between the point in 2022 when its remaining $1.3 billion of cash runs out, and the date a few years later when Oyu Tolgoi’s main underground phase starts throwing off cash. Stausholm can choose between an incremental solution and a radical one. The former, favoured by some Turquoise minority shareholders, would deploy various measures to plug the funding gap. Extending the maturity on about a third of the $4.4 billion in financing Oyu Tolgoi obtained from international lenders in 2015 would reduce servicing costs. Issuing other debt, pre-selling some of the mine’s metal, and higher copper price assumptions would do the rest. Odey prefers a bolder approach. Rather than increase Turquoise’s debt, it thinks Rio should push for a big rights issue. That makes sense insofar as the $3 billion funding gap might actually increase if Turquoise ends up having to pay for a power station to provide the mine’s energy, which is currently provided by China. But given that Turquoise’s market capitalisation is less than $2.5 billion, any investors that didn’t take part in the equity raise would be heavily diluted. Stausholm won’t be eager to antagonise Turquoise’s minority shareholders, nor put still more of his company’s money into an Oyu Tolgoi-related capital call. With minimal net debt, however, Rio is in a position to push for the most sustainable long-term solution. His company already guarantees the $4.4 billion project finance facility and consolidates the $8.3 billion of loans. An equity hike would leave Rio with more of the project’s cash flows without increasing the debt it underwrites. Rio’s boss also needs to tread carefully around Ulaanbaatar. Mongolia’s nuclear option would be to dismiss the $140 billion miner from the project and bring in one of its rivals instead. Tearing up such a high-profile contract might hurt foreign investment flows into the country, but Oyu Tolgoi’s significance could make it worth the risk. In addition to solving the funding gap, the host country wants more cash from the mine it feels it owns. Stausholm’s least-bad strategy therefore probably has two strands. First, Rio should back an equity hike to plug the funding gap. If Turquoise’s minority shareholders are optimistic about Oyu Tolgoi, they should be ready to support a rights issue. Second, Stausholm should rework the loan structure to appease Mongolia. One option is to put 75% of the cash that Oyu Tolgoi generates toward reducing debt and use the rest for payouts to Ulaanbaatar. It might even take a 50-50 split to ease relations between miner and state. Under this approach, along with having to answer to angry Turquoise owners, Rio might take a financial hit. But it is likely to do so in almost any solution. There’s no way for Stausholm to make everyone happy. As the new broom, he at least has a freer hand compared to his predecessor Jean-Sebastien Jacques, who was so closely associated with the project. He may as well use it."
0.781453361526979," Rio Tinto enters scandium market with plant in Canada's Quebec TORONTO (Reuters) - Global miner Rio Tinto said on Thursday it will become North America’s first producer of critical mineral scandium oxide with construction of a commercial-scale demonstration plant in the Canadian province of Quebec. Rio said it would invest $6 million to build the first module in the plant at its metallurgical complex in Sorel-Tracy, Que., with commercial output starting in the second quarter. Scandium oxide is used in lasers and lighting for stadiums and for production of alloys for the aerospace and defence industries, among other applications. Rio said it has developed a process to extract high purity scandium oxide from the waste streams of titanium dioxide production, without the need for any additional mining at its ilmenite mine in Havre-Saint-Pierre, Que. Mineral-rich Quebec is providing $650,000 to the project, part of wider efforts by the province to support development of strategic minerals."
1.7370494238842071," UPDATE 2-Rio Tinto reaches deal to continue NZ aluminium smelter ops till 2024 (Adds comment from NZ finance minister, share price) Jan 14 (Reuters) - Global miner Rio Tinto said on Thursday it had reached an agreement with electricity provider Meridian Energy to allow its aluminium smelter in New Zealand to continue operations until December 2024. Rio Tinto had said in July that it would close New Zealand’s Aluminium Smelter (NZAS), which is the country’s single largest power user, due to high costs and a challenging market. The move would put over a thousand jobs on the line and dealing a blow to the country’s top power producers. The decision to close the smelter had disappointed politicians and local power firms as it came when the COVID-19 pandemic began to cripple the economy. The miner said that while talks were ongoing with the government to address the smelter’s high transmission costs, the deal with Meridian over power prices would make the smelter economically viable. The smelter employs over 1000 people directly and creates a further 1600 indirect jobs in Tiwai, located in the country’s southernmost region of Southland. “This agreement improves Tiwai Point’s competitive position and secures the extension of operation to December 2024,” Rio Tinto Aluminium chief executive Alf Barrios said in a statement. The government said the extension allows time for a managed transition while also protecting jobs. “Today’s news is particularly welcome given the economic uncertainty created by the global COVID-19 pandemic,” Finance Minister Grant Robertson said in a statement. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who won a second term in office last year, had said she would negotiate with Rio Tinto to extend the smelter’s operations. It is a joint venture between Rio and Japan’s Sumitomo Chemical Co. Rio had an underlying loss of NZ$46 million ($33.1 million) in 2019 arising from it. In separate statements, Meridian Energy and fellow electricity provider Contact Energy said they welcomed the move to extend the smelter’s operations.

1.7370494238842071," Native Americans sue Trump administration over Rio Tinto's Arizona copper project (Reuters) - Members of the San Carlos Apache tribe in Arizona on Tuesday said they have sued the Trump Administration to block a pending land swap that would give Rio Tinto the land it needs to build its Resolution Copper project. Apache Stronghold, a non-profit organization that filed the lawsuit in the U.S. District Court in Phoenix, said it sought to stop the publication of a final environmental impact statement that will trigger the transfer of Oak Flat land to Resolution Copper. Oak Flat, or Chi’chil Bildagoteel, is central to the Apache tribe’s traditional religion and identity. The land is located about 70 miles east of Phoenix in the Tonto National Forest. “Giving away our sacred land by the U.S. Government for destruction by a foreign mining company destroys our ability to practice our religion,” Apache Stronghold said in an emailed statement. In a separate letter to the U.S Department of Agriculture obtained by Reuters, tribe chairman Terry Rambler said the department had failed to consider “substantial new information about cumulative impacts to groundwater resources,” particularly at the proposed tailings dam site. He requested the department hold off publication until all new information had been considered: “At stake are potentially disastrous environmental impacts,” Rambler said. Resolution Copper said it was reviewing the complaint. “We remain committed to ongoing engagement with Native American Tribes to continue shaping the project and deliver initiatives that recognise and protect cultural heritage,” it said in a statement. It has said that it anticipates the Oak Flat campgrounds will be open for at least the next several decades, and possibly longer, if it decides to go ahead with the project. Minority partner BHP Group had no immediate comment. U.S. President Donald Trump’s outgoing administration plans to approve the land swap on Jan. 15, clearing a long-time hurdle for a project that is opposed by many Native Americans. The statement is slated to be published on Friday, five days before Trump is replaced by President-elect Joe Biden.

-1.402781827888846," UPDATE 2-Mongolia considers terminating Oyu Tolgoi copper mine expansion as costs jump -developer (Adds shares, comment from Rio, analysts) Jan 11 (Reuters) - Rio Tinto-controlled Turquoise Hill Resources said on Monday that Mongolia’s government is considering terminating the companies’ underground expansion of their Oyu Tolgoi copper mine project due to rising development costs. Shares of Turquoise Hill fell as much as 20% in early trading on the news. Oyu Tolgoi is one of the world’s largest-known copper and gold deposits. Rio Tinto announced in 2019 a 30-month delay to a project to expand the mine underground and a cost overrun due to difficult geology. Last month the company confirmed that the expansion at the mine would cost $6.75 billion, about $1.4 billion higher than its estimate in 2016. The government has told Rio Tinto it is dissatisfied with the miner’s plans and is concerned that the significant increase in the development costs of the Oyu Tolgoi project has eroded the economic benefits that the country had hoped to get, Turquoise Hill said. “The government of Mongolia has indicated that if the Oyu Tolgoi project is not economically beneficial to the country, it would be necessary to review and evaluate whether it can proceed,” Turquoise Hill said in a statement. The government’s position is not surprising given it is not expected to receive any cash flows beyond taxes and mining royalties from its ownership stake in the project for the foreseeable future due to $7 billion in partner loans accumulated during construction, Bank of Nova Scotia analyst Orest Wowkodaw said. The Mongolian government holds a 34% stake in the mine and Turquoise Hill owns 66%. Exchanging the government’s stake for “a markedly higher royalty (cash flowing immediately) would be in the best interest of all stakeholders,” Wowkodaw said. Turquoise Hill said it was committed to engaging immediately with the government and Rio Tinto to address the development plan and revisit the sharing of economic benefits. The companies have sunk $11 billion into the mine since 2010, Rio said in a separate statement to Reuters, adding it “remains open” to increasing benefits to all shareholders."

The Local Authority Pension Fund Forum (LAPFF), a shareholder in both firms, said this week that it had written to them to ask how the U.S. project, which could be approved within days, will affect local communities, as Native American tribes say it could destroy cultural and religious sites. Clashes are becoming more frequent between indigenous groups and mining companies eager to produce more copper for electric vehicles and other green technologies. Rio Tinto and BHP, via their subsidiary Resolution Copper Co, have sought for years to access the copper deposit in Arizona. A land swap, proposed in 2015, is now expected to be approved by the outgoing U.S. administration, which is moving to loosen mining regulations before leaving office on Jan. 20. Rio Tinto, which is the project’s majority owner and operator, said the land swap would be “just one step in an ongoing permitting and feasibility study process over coming years, before any decision on investment to proceed”. The company sent a letter to Native American tribal leaders last month in which it committed to working with tribal groups and seeking their consent. BHP, as a minority partner, declined to comment. The underground copper deposit in the Tonto National Forest abuts the San Carlos and Fort Apache Indian reservation, which the local tribes consider the home of religious deities and where they hold tribal ceremonies. LAPFF, whose member schemes manage more than 300 billion pounds ($400 billion) in assets, has direct holdings in both Rio Tinto and BHP. It opposes the use of block caving, expected to be the method chosen for the project, its chairman Doug McMurdo told Reuters. In block caving, a large section of rock is undercut to create an artificial cave that collapses under the weight of the rock above. “Over the past couple of years, LAPFF has engaged extensively with communities affected by mining operations in Brazil, Australia, and the U.S.,” McMurdo said in a statement. “These engagements have revealed troubling patterns of mining companies failing to incorporate community voice adequately into decision-making processes.” LAPFF is in contact with other pension funds and shareholders of the mining companies.

5.4344451428377845," British Columbia post-holiday COVID restrictions slow several industrial projects CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Restrictions imposed by British Columbia to fight the spread of COVID-19 infections after the holiday break have disrupted work at construction sites of a Rio Tinto hydropower project and BC Hydro’s Site C dam. A total of five major industrial projects in remote northwestern Canada have been affected as the provincial government last week ordered them to stagger the return of their workers after the Christmas holiday break. BC Hydro’s Site C dam, Rio Tinto’s Kemano T2 hydropower project, the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion, TC Energy’s Coastal GasLink pipeline and the Royal Dutch Shell-led LNG Canada project are named in the order. The companies did not say how the slow return of workers would impact ultimate completion dates for their projects. Across the five projects the number of workers will ramp up from a baseline of 1,460 to 4,080 by mid-February. Provincial health officer Dr Bonnie Henry said a rapid return to full operating capacity after Christmas would likely “fuel and accelerate” the spread of COVID-19 among workers and surrounding communities. “While these changes will have a further impact on our overall project schedule and cost, we understand the rationale for the order,” said David Conway, spokesman for the C$10.7 billion ($8.4 billion) Site C project on the Peace river, which is already over budget. Rio Tinto’s Kemano T2 project, in which a second tunnel is being built to provide hydropower to the BC Works aluminium smelter in Kitimat, would normally have 330 workers on site but will be limited to 280 until further notice. Rio Tinto expects the project to resume operations when it is authorized “to increase the number of workers onsite to safely operate the tunnel boring machine,” a company spokesman said. The Canadian government-owned Trans Mountain project halted work on the pipeline expansion in December after multiple safety issues. Construction was meant to restart on Monday but is still paused, although Trans Mountain did not say whether the new COVID-19 rules had caused the delay. The 1,150-kilometer pipeline carries crude from Alberta across British Columbia to the coast and the order only affects one work camp in Valemount. “We are in the final stages of our restart planning and anticipate that we will be providing further details on restart dates in the coming days,” a Trans Mountain spokeswoman said on Tuesday. An LNG Canada spokesman said the slower return to work schedule would enable the project to keep going with “seasonally critical” work.

Stausholm, who joined Rio as CFO in 2018, is now tasked with the tough job of repairing strained relationships with investors and the Aboriginal community while reforming the mining company to improve oversight. Rio’s choice of an internal candidate was a surprise as most bankers and investors had expecting the company to choose an outsider to start with a clean slate. “This decision appears to be further evidence of poor corporate governance and suggests a lack of any credible succession planning,” said Doug McMurdo, chairman of Britain’s Local Authority Pension Fund Forum which represents 82 members with 300 billion pounds ($408 billion) under management. “It further raises questions about Rio Tinto’s corporate culture over the last few years,” he said, adding that it also showed there had been a lack of consultation by Rio Chairman Simon Thompson with investors. The board’s handling of the aftermath of the cave blasts has cast a shadow over Thomson’s tenure. Analysts at Morgan Stanley said Stausholm’s appointment could indicate little change in the overall strategy but that it should minimize the typical disruption period caused by management transitions. Shares in London, which are at record highs on booming iron ore prices, had climbed 1.8% by 1135 GMT. ‘ENORMOUS CHALLENGE’ The appointment of a Danish CEO after Frenchman Jacques will also come as a surprise to Australian investors, who have argued that a new CEO should have local experience and be based in the country that provides 85% of Rio’s profits. “Coming in at Rio at a time when the company’s social license has been so fundamentally undermined through its own actions is an enormous challenge,” said Adam Matthews, director of ethics and engagement at the Church of England.

8.626890947000792," Rio Tinto confirms $6.75 billion cost for Mongolia mine, production to start late 2022 (Reuters) - Global miner Rio Tinto said on Wednesday the underground expansion at its Oyu Tolgoi copper mine in Mongolia would cost $6.75 billion, as it remained at odds with its majority-owned Turquoise Hill Resources over funding for the mine. Oyu Tolgoi is one of the world’s largest-known copper and gold deposits, located in the South Gobi region of Mongolia. The Mongolian government holds a 34% stake in the project, and Rio-controlled Turquoise Hill owns the rest. The project was held up as Mongolia sought to strike a better bargain, with Rio and Turquoise locked in a feud over the expansion’s funding, and costs ballooning because of the difficult geology of the site. Rio said Wednesday progress on funding has been “limited” and reiterated that it “remains of the view that all shareholders should contribute proportionately” to mine development. The miner said expansion of the first section of the underground zone would achieve sustainable production by October 2022. Costs accounted for the expected impact from COVID-19, it said. “Overall, we view the update as positive for TRQ (Turquoise Hill) shares given the slightly lower capex,” Scotiabank analyst Orest Wowkodaw told clients. Turquoise Hill had previously pegged costs for the mine extension around $6.85 billion. Its shares were up slightly at C$15.13 by mid-morning. Rio said Oyu Tolgoi is expected to produce 480,000 tonnes of copper per year on average from 2028 to 2036 from both the open pit and underground mine, against 146,300 tonnes in 2019 from just the open pit. By 2030, Oyu Tolgoi is expected to be the fourth-largest copper mine in the world, the company said. The miner said the next two sections of the underground mine, which would support a ramp-up to 95,000 tonnes of ore per day, were still being studied, with initial recommendations expected by mid-2021."
18.40342345469258," Rio Tinto should pay restitution for sacred Aboriginal caves blast - inquiry MELBOURNE (Reuters) -Mining giant Rio Tinto Ltd should pay restitution to Indigenous Australians affected by its destruction of two ancient rock shelters to expand an iron ore mine, an inquiry panel said on Wednesday. The panel released an interim report in which it also recommended Rio Tinto should fully reconstruct the rock shelters in Western Australia’s Pilbara region at its own expense, and laid out broader industry guidance that included reviewing consent practices and a moratorium on mining in the affected places. The inquiry did not spell out what, if any, financial compensation Rio Tinto should pay to the traditional owners as part of a negotiated restitution package. But it said the agreement should include keeping places where artefacts and other material could be stored and displayed for their benefit. The parliamentary inquiry into the legal destruction of the 46,000-year-old Juukan Gorge rock shelter in May held 13 public hearings, and received more than 140 submissions from miners, heritage specialists and Aboriginal and civil society groups. The committee now aims to finish its report in the second half of 2021, once it has heard testimony from other states after COVID-19-related disruptions. The Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP) people whose lands were impacted said in statement they hoped the inquiry’s findings prompted a “fundamental reset” of the sector, particularly in the relationships between traditional owners and miners. While it had started the long road to healing and repairing its relationship with Rio, “there is still a long way to go,” it added. “Rio Tinto now needs to turn its words into actions.” The inquiry has sparked some industry change, with miners reviewing processes and their relationships with traditional owners of the land on which they operate. But there is room for more, the inquiry found. While castigating Rio for its failures, the inquiry said the company could yet “re-establish itself as a leader” if it followed best practice, particularly around consent. In a statement, Rio Tinto reiterated its apology, set out reforms it has made to its practices, and said that it was pushing hard to remedy the destruction that caused significant pain to the PKKP. Rio is expected to announce its new chief executive any day, after Jean-Sébastien Jacques and two other senior leaders agreed to step down in August due to the procedural failings it found led to the disaster and the way it was initially managed. Even if Rio did have to pay some compensation, in the context of its $123 billion valuation, the amount was not likely to be material, said Glyn Lawcock of UBS. Still, recommendations to overhaul legislation could result in delays to industry mine expansion plans in the years ahead, Lawcock added. West Australia’s outdated Aboriginal heritage laws that favour development are under review and not expected to be considered by lawmakers until next year. Until they are reformed, in the absence of clear consent of traditional owners, all miners should hold off new applications that would damage Aboriginal heritage sites, the inquiry said. Australia should also set down laws to ensure no ‘gag’ clauses can be stitched into agreements that restrict Indigenous people from objecting to development on their land, it said. “The ultimate cause of the destruction of the caves was that insufficient value has been placed on the preservation of Indigenous culture and heritage — a living culture with a timeless heritage,” the inquiry found. “That must change.”"

The inquiry into the destruction of the 46,000-year-old Juukan Gorge rock shelter in May has heard testimony from dozens of people and more than 140 submissions from miners, heritage specialists and Aboriginal and civil society groups. The committee is due to table its report to the Senate on Wednesday afternoon, after COVID-19 disruptions delayed hearings, and is now more likely to finish in the second half of 2021 once it has heard testimony from other states, an official told Reuters. It is widely expected to castigate Rio on its failures as well as propose mining industry and legal reform. Its findings may also include a call for compensation. “I think the only risk is that Rio has to pay some form of restitution,” said analyst Glyn Lawcock of UBS in Sydney. Even then, in the context of Rio Tinto’s $123 billion valuation, the amount was not likely to be material; however recommendations to overhaul legislation could result in delays to industry mine expansion plans in the years ahead, he said. “That could slow the process down and that will have an impact on global supply and demand at the end of the day,” he said. Western Australia supplies 55% of China’s iron ore needs. Rio is also expected to announce its new chief executive any day, after Jean-Sébastien Jacques and two other senior leaders agreed to step down in August due to the procedural failings it found led to the disaster and the way it was initially managed.

By shining a light on outdated industry practices and the laws that support them, the inquiry has already sparked change, even though its recommendations may well fall short of demands from Aboriginal groups for a right of veto, lawyers and Indigenous advocates say. “From an Aboriginal rights and social licence to operate perspective, the world has turned and if anyone in the resources industry... is wanting to impact country, they ignore that at their peril,” said Marcus Holmes, principal of Land Equity Legal, who has negotiated more than 250 native title and heritage agreements in the past 25 years. Already, Rio has acknowledged procedural failings and its chief executive and two other senior leaders have lost their jobs. It is expected to announce its new leader any day. The inquiry has exposed practices including ‘gag’ clauses in land use agreements that restrict Aboriginal groups from publicly objecting to mining developments and from using some Australian laws to protect their land. Some of these are now being unwound. Among changes by Australia’s iron ore giants, Rio has increased its oversight and accountability to include reviews of its heritage management by board committees. Rival BHP Group has found ways to preserve more heritage sites at a mine expansion in the same region and now requires more senior level approval before any site is harmed. It has also stepped up discussions with Indigenous groups. Fortescue Metals Group said it will now inform Aboriginal groups when it plans to impact their sites in case they have new information to offer. Institutional investors are also demanding greater accountability. “Particularly this year, investors are learning that you have to look behind a company’s reporting and statements if you want to know the truth about ESG performance,” said legal counsel James Fitzgerald of activist shareholder the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility. Whether the committee would go as far as to recommend veto rights was the big question, said Jamie Lowe, chief executive of land rights body the National Native Title Council. “We don’t need to be scared of this question of veto. In ethical organisations, if (an Aboriginal landowner group) says ‘See that sacred site over there, don’t go there’, most say ‘OK, we won’t go there’. It will be protected,” he said. “First Nations people, they are not adverse to development. We just want our heritage protected at the same time.”"
33.01732455454483," Turquoise Hill says special committee to review Oyu Tolgoi cost overruns Dec 1 (Reuters) - Turquoise Hill said on Tuesday the board of Oyu Tolgoi mine in Mongolia has approved forming a special committee to conduct an independent review of cost overruns and delays related to the development of the underground copper mine. The Oyu Tolgoi deposit in south Mongolia, jointly owned by Rio Tinto-controlled Turquoise Hill and the Mongolian state has come under scrutiny over its funding plan, with Hedge Fund Odey recently raising concerns over the project finance package for the mine. (bit.ly/2JbFMEb) In a letter to the Australian exchange on Monday, an investor in the Mongolian project accused Rio of mismanaging costs, and then unfairly restricting Turquoise Hill’s ability to obtain finance to pay for those costs. Turquoise Hill last month began arbitration proceedings against its biggest shareholder Rio Tinto to seek “clarity” on financing for Oyu Tolgoi, one of Rio’s biggest growth projects. Turquoise Hill on Tuesday said each shareholder of Oyu Tolgoi, as well as Rio Tinto, is required to support the work of the committee and to contribute, on a confidential basis, “any internal or third-party report(s) in its possession relating to the cost overruns and delays.” Rio Tinto had said in September it planned to raise up to $500 million through additional lending to develop the giant copper mine. Rio and Turquoise Hill were to jointly pursue the debt reprofiling process by engaging with existing project finance lenders, and expected a reduction of up to $1.4 billion in funding requirements for Oyu Tolgoi. Rio in 2019 announced a cost overrun at the project of up to $1.9 billion due to difficult geology, saying total capital expenditure was expected to be in a range of $6.5 billion to $7.2 billion, and it expected a delay of up to 30 months at the mine’s underground extension.

Brian Gilvary The former Chief Financial Officer of BP has proven himself to be adept at cleaning up messes and firefighting, investors say. Gilvary, 58, who retired from BP in June after 34 years including eight as finance chief, oversaw the oil giant’s recovery from the catastrophic Deepwater Horizon oil spill which cost it $65 billion in fines and huge reputational damage. Gilvary also led discussions with BP’s top investors around the oil and gas company’s commitment to reducing carbon emissions, which led to a 2019 shareholder resolution in which BP committed to align its strategy with the 2015 Paris climate agreement. Still, the British oil executive has drawbacks: he has no mining industry experience, and although he has a good reputation for stakeholder management and relationships, he does not have experience in Australia. Gilvary declined to comment when asked about his possible candidacy for the Rio job.

Shares of Turquoise Hill sank on Wednesday after hedge fund Odey said it did not believe the $4.4 billion project finance package related to the Oyu Tolgoi copper mine in Mongolia is accurately described as “project” finance. Odey did not immediately respond to Reuters’ request for comment. The Oyu Tolgoi deposit in south Mongolia is jointly owned by Rio-controlled Turquoise Hill and the Mongolian state and ranks as one of the world’s largest known copper and gold deposits. Earlier this month Turquoise Hill began arbitration proceedings against Rio to seek “clarity” on financing the mine, one of Rio’s biggest growth projects. Turquoise Hill said Thursday that an additional $1.1 billion would need to be sourced with further bank debt, bonds or a metal stream should it and Rio re-profile existing debt and raise an additional $500 million of debt as contemplated. The company said it would need to raise additional equity of at least $3 billion if neither the re-profiling nor additional debt or hybrid financing is completed.

35.98370196526257," Rio Tinto neglected good communication with Indigenous groups: executive MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Global miner Rio Tinto neglected deep communications with traditional owners during China’s iron ore boom, focusing instead on the technical challenges of ramping up and then shrinking its business, an executive said on Tuesday. That led to procedural failures and the destruction of sacred rockshelters for a mine expansion in Australia, Steve McIntosh, Rio Tinto’s outgoing head of growth and innovation, told a mining conference in Melbourne. The blasting of two ancient sacred caves in May caused public outcry and the departure of Rio’s chief executive and two deputies. A parliamentary inquiry is due to report on the incident on Dec. 9. “During the China-led boom, the industry grew enormously. You grow a business, iron ore in this case by 350%, is everything going to keep up with that growth? Technically, yes, the company was able to achieve it,” he said. “But clearly in terms of internal systems and processes, because of the size and scale of those businesses ... we’ve ended up with an issue where we probably became overly transactional and there were clearly breakdowns in communications that need to be fixed.” McIntosh, a respected industry figure credited with Rio’s Winu copper find in Western Australia, is on long service leave after announcing his retirement this year. He will depart Rio at year-end following 30 years with the company. McIntosh headed exploration, working closely with Aboriginal communities during a period when Rio built what was seen as a first-class reputation for dealing with Indigenous Australians. Rio’s leadership legacy should not be viewed through the prism of this one event, he said, given the company’s other achievements. Moving forward, all miners must prioritise sustainable development goals, and deal with legacies such as tailings dams. “There are lots of big issues, a company simply just has to get them all right,” McIntosh said."
38.38128766758784," Australian institutional investor sees heritage risk across mining industry MELBOURNE, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Australian superannuation fund HESTA said on Tuesday that Rio Tinto’s destruction of ancient sacred rockshelters in Western Australia this year has highlighted structural risk around heritage management practices in the mining sector. The fund is calling for an independent review of the partnership agreements between mining companies and traditional owners to better manage risk, said Mary Delahunty, HESTA’s head of impact, during a parliamentary inquiry into the destruction of the Juukan Gorge rock shelters in May. HESTA holds A$244 million ($178.53 million) in Rio Tinto shares and just over A$2 billion in Australian mining companies. Rio Tinto’s legal destruction of the Juukan Gorge shelters for an iron ore mine expansion distressed the traditional owners and caused a public outcry that cost three senior Rio leaders, including the chief executive, his job. The inquiry has unearthed controversial heritage practices such as contracts between miners and indigenous groups having “gag clauses” that prevent the groups from publicly objecting to mining development on their ancestral lands and others that eroded their legal rights. “Mining companies that fail to negotiate fairly and in good faith with Traditional Owners expose the company to reputational and legal risks,” she said. HESTA is pushing for an independent review of the agreements between traditional owners and mining companies across the industry because of the “systemic” risks they pose. “If those agreements in any way erode the rights of the parties or have been negotiated without an understanding of power imbalance then they are not future ready, should probably not be relied apon and introduce a risk to investors that is material to the company’s value,” she said. Institutional investors are stepping up their scrutiny of miners. Investors worth $10.2 trillion wrote to the boards of 78 global mining companies last month to ask for more information about their heritage practices with First Nations people. HESTA is also calling for clear national standards around heritage sites and further action by investors. The parliamentary committee is due to report its findings by Dec. 9."
32.450959295937416," UPDATE 2-Gold stream probably 'most attractive' funding option for Turquoise Hill -Wheaton CEO (Updates with Rio no comment, analyst) Nov 10 (Reuters) - A gold stream is “probably the most attractive” option for Canadian miner Turquoise Hill Resources as it seeks funding for a copper and gold project in Mongolia, the head of mine financing company Wheaton Precious Metals said on Tuesday. Turquoise Hill last week began arbitration proceedings against its biggest shareholder Rio Tinto to seek “clarity” on financing for Oyu Tolgoi, one of Rio’s biggest growth projects. Streaming is a type of alternative finance that generally involves an upfront payment by the streamer to a miner, which repays the loan by supplying metal at a later date. A “gold streaming transaction” is among options under study by Turquoise Hill to plug a funding gap for the project estimated at $1.7 billion as of the end of the second quarter, the company said. The aim would be to reduce the size and delay the timing of any equity rights offering. “Definitely from a Turquoise Hill shareholder perspective I would say it is probably the most attractive way of financing that project,” Randy Smallwood, president and chief executive of Wheaton Precious Metals, told Reuters. He declined comment when asked if Wheaton was in active talks. Any such deal would require approval from Rio. “That’s one of the challenges that I think Turquoise Hill has,” he said. Turquoise Hill and Rio declined comment. Additional debt or a streaming agreement are not in Rio’s best interests as both options would leave the miner carrying all the risk but with a higher cost of capital than a direct equity funding option, Bank of Montreal analyst Edward Sterck said last week in note. The Oyu Tolgoi deposit in south Mongolia is jointly owned by the Mongolian state and ranks as one of the world’s largest known copper and gold deposits.

34.005003453896265," Rio Tinto vows reform as Australian lawmaker accuses industry of cultural genocide MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Outgoing Rio Tinto Chief Executive Jean-Sébastien Jacques said on Friday the miner was committed to reform after a lawmaker accused the industry of incremental cultural genocide at an Australian inquiry into the destruction of an ancient cave. Speaking for a second time at a parliamentary inquiry into how the world’s biggest iron ore miner destroyed a culturally significant 46,000-year-old rockshelter in Western Australia, Jacques repeated an apology and vowed Rio would improve its efforts. “It should have never happened,” Jacques told the inquiry into the destruction of the rockshelters at Juukan Gorge as part of an iron ore mine expansion in May, which caused deep distress to the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP) people. Rio’s CEO, corporate relations chief Simone Niven and head of iron ore Chris Salisbury all faced the inquiry after handing in their resignations last month, bowing to a shareholder outcry over the destruction of the rockshelters and what was seen as the miner’s inadequate initial response. “Anyone that has been objectively listening to this inquiry ... would have to draw the conclusion that this is a form of incremental genocide,” Senator Pat Dodson, an Aboriginal man, told Rio at the inquiry. Dodson referred to confidentiality clauses in mining agreements that restrict traditional owners from public comment about their heritage concerns, and clauses that restrict their ability to use broader Australian laws for site protection. He also said that the mining industry had taken advantage of “weak laws” in Western Australia that allowed miners to apply to destroy sites, but that did not give a traditional owners a right to appeal. The heritage laws are undergoing reform. “You are an international company. You have destroyed significant heritage for humanity ... Saying sorry is one very important matter. And it seems to me that your future reputation will swing very much, as will other companies’, on how they behave to First Nations peoples,” Dodson added. Rio has taken steps to reform its cultural heritage management practices, including changing reporting lines and responsibilities, and putting a 57 square km (22 square mile) mining moratorium on the affected lands of the PKKP. “We fully agree and that is why we are absolutely committed to change, to reform. We have started, we have already taken action, there is more work to be carried out for all the reasons you have just mentioned,” said Jacques, who is due to step down by the end of March. Rio pledged to modernise its agreements and create stronger heritage protection in a letter to the 12 Aboriginal groups it has agreements with in Pilbara region, signed by acting head of iron ore Ivan Vella. In the letter, supplied by Rio, it said it would not enforce confidentiality clauses restricting groups from raising cultural heritage concerns, or those that would impede applications for legal protection of any cultural heritage sites. The incident has sparked a review by Australian miners, including peers BHP Group and Fortescue, of their cultural heritage management practices, and led large institutional investors to focus on First Nations heritage management."
34.005003453896265," Rio Tinto warns fresh COVID-19 lockdowns to put global recovery at risk MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Rio Tinto warned on Friday that a resurgence in coronavirus cases was putting global economic growth at risk, and that steel production outside China has sharply dropped even as stimulus measures prop up demand in the top consumer. Worldwide trade has been showing signs of recovery as countries emerge from lockdowns, but economists still see challenges with fresh outbreaks adding to the uncertainty about the path of the pandemic and its economic fallout. “Global economic activity in the third quarter was generally strong, helping to sustain optimism for a widespread recovery in 2021,” Rio said in its quarterly production report. But data suggests “the rate of recovery in growth is slowing in most economies, with pent-up demand dissipating, and the rise of renewed lockdowns threatening recovery”, it added. China’s commodity-intensive stimulus measures have supported record demand for iron ore but steel production outside of China remains down significantly year on year, the world’s biggest iron ore mining company said. Inventories of iron ore, a steelmaking ingredient, are expected to grow modestly amid strong fourth-quarter shipments from major producers and as China’s steel consumption eases from record highs and scrap consumption increases, Rio said. However, steel production in Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Europe are showing signs of recovery, it added. Rio posted a 4.6% drop in third-quarter iron ore shipments to 82.1 million tonnes due to planned maintenance at Australia’s Dampier Port, ahead of a UBS estimate of 81.9 million tonnes. But it kept its annual shipment forecast of 324 million-334 million tonnes. Iron ore accounts for more than 85% of Rio’s underlying earnings. Rio shares fell 0.5% to A$95.79 ($67.84) in a flat broader market. The miner narrowed its estimated development costs for its Mongolian copper project Oyu Tolgoi to $6.6 billion-$7.1 billion, from $6.5 billion-$7.2 billion, adding that first production is trending towards the earlier months of the October 2022 to June 2023 range. Rio also said the start of production at its Winu copper project in Australia’s Pilbara region could be delayed beyond 2023 because talks with indigenous traditional land owners could take longer than anticipated. Rio’s CEO and two deputies announced their resignations last month, bowing to a shareholder outcry over the destruction of two significant Aboriginal rockshelters and what was seen as the miner’s inadequate initial response. Rio said it has changed the name of its Koodaideri iron ore project, which is on track to start production in early 2022, to Gudai-Darri at the request of the Banjima traditional owners. At Rio’s U.S. Kennecott operations, mined copper production fell 40% on the year due to lower grades while refined copper slumped 74% after a delay to smelter restart.

36.19711497479147," Aboriginal group say Fortescue has applied to mine near destroyed caves MELBOURNE (Reuters) - An Australian Aboriginal group whose sacred rockshelters Rio Tinto RIO.AX destroyed in May said on Monday that iron ore miner Fortescue Metals Group FMG.AX applied last month for a mining licence on the surrounding area without notifying them. Speaking at an Australian parliamentary inquiry into the Juukan Gorge disaster, in which Rio Tinto destroyed a 46,000 year old rockshelter in Western Australia that shed light on humankind’s development, cultural heritage expert Heather Builth said traditional owners had worked hard to secure a moratorium with Rio over the area after the blast. The moratorium over the disturbed area and surrounds which was agreed with Rio for six months, was to help better investigate the region that showed evidence of continual human habitation back through the last ice age, and was sacred to the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP) men’s spiritual business, Builth said. However, Fortescue had applied for a mining licence on Sept. 27 on the area that the traditional owners had identified as high cultural sensitivity and had not informed them. “We are working with FMG, we have meetings with FMG but we weren’t told of this - we had to find it out ourselves,” she told the inquiry. “We are very worried. Especially since we haven’t finished our cultural mapping, our landscape understanding of that area,” Builth said. “It is insensitive to say the least, it is unconscionable to say the most.” Fortescue Chief Executive Elizabeth Gaines confirmed that Fortescue had applied for a mining lease over an area approximately 10 kilometres (6.2 miles) from Juukan Gorge as per industry practice, for which it had prospecting licences granted in 2012 that were about to expire. There were no current plans to mine the area, she said in a statement adding that Fortescue had begun discussions with the PKKP about conducting extensive heritage surveys of the area. “We take our relationship with Traditional Custodians very seriously and, we will continue to work with the PKKP to survey the area and understand areas of cultural significance.” The destruction of two rockshelters and outcry at the light sanctions doled out by Rio's board cost Chief Executive Jean-Sébastien Jacques and two executives their jobs as well as triggering a widespread review by peers including BHP Group BHP.AX and Fortescue of their heritage management. The PKKP have spoken rarely since the blast, partly due to strict confidentiality clauses in their mining agreements which have inhibited them from speaking freely about their heritage concerns outside the inquiry, PKKP Corporation Chief Executive Carol Meredith said at the inquiry. Rio has said that it is open to reviewing clauses in its contracts that restrict the PKKP and other traditional owner groups from publicly opposing or criticising its planned mining developments."
24.96279860358333," Rio Tinto smelter in focus as New Zealand's PM seeks extension WELLINGTON (Reuters) - New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Monday that she will negotiate to extend the operations of Rio Tinto’s aluminum smelter in the country by 3-5 years if she is returned to power in the Oct. 17 election. New Zealand Aluminum Smelter’s (NZAS) planned closure is a hot election topic as it puts thousands of jobs at risk, and would hit the bottom line of top power producers, at a time when the country is reeling from the economic impact of coronavirus. The world’s biggest iron ore miner has said it was closing the plant by August 2021 due to high costs and a challenging market. “We are seeking to extend the life of the smelter between 3 to 5 years...,” Ardern said at a news conference in Invercargill in Southland, the country’s southernmost region where she is on a campaigning tour. “By providing an extended time frame for the closure of the smelter we protect jobs now and give the community time to consider and plan for future opportunities...,” she said. NZAS consumes about 5,000 gigawatt hours of electricity a year, roughly 12% of the country’s power. The smelter employs around 1,000 people directly and creates another 1,600 indirect jobs in the Southland region. Ardern said if her ruling Labour Party-led government is returned to power it would work with Rio Tinto and state-owned electricity transmitter Transpower to reach a fair price for transmission costs over the closure period, to lessen the impact on power prices for other consumers. The government could provide support to Transpower to enable reduced transmission charges, the ruling Labour party said in a statement announcing details. “We are always open to continuing conversations that would see fairer costs established for the smelter,” Rio Tinto’s Managing Director of Pacific Operations Kellie Parker said in an emailed statement after Ardern’s announcement. Rio has been threatening to shutter the smelter for years as it demanded further subsidies from the government. Ardern said there would be no further direct subsidies from the government. Shares of power firms were top gainers on the stock market as investors cheered news that the smelter operations may be extended. Shares of Meridian Energy Ltd were up 6.6%, Contact Energy Ltd was higher 6.1% and Mercury NZ Ltd soared to 7.4% on the New Zealand bourse. “We’re very pleased with this news as it demonstrates broad-based political support for an orderly transition to a post-Tiwai world,” Contact Energy CEO Mike Fuge said in a statement. Ardern, 40, is poised to retain power at next month’s election, a widely watched poll showed on Sunday, although a recent COVID-19 outbreak has dented her support slightly. Ardern’s rival, the opposition National Party leader Judith Collins, has also promised to keep the smelter open by facilitating talks between Rio, power companies and Transpower if she won the polls."

Rio Tinto said in July it was closing its aluminium smelter in Tiwai Point due to high costs and a challenging market, putting over a thousand jobs on the line and dealing a blow to the country’s top power producers."
22.602176007879375," Rio Tinto to develop bonded area operations for blending iron ore at Dalian port BEIJING/NINGBO (Reuters) - Anglo-Australian miner Rio Tinto RIO.AX has signed a pact to jointly develop its first bonded area operations to blend iron ore in China's port of Dalian, the company said on Tuesday, as it moves to widen offerings for customers across Asia. China, the world’s top iron ore consumer, brought in more than one billion tonnes of the steelmaking ingredient in 2019. The MoU with Dalian Port Co Ltd allows Rio Tinto to also use the Chinese port as a transhipment hub, the company said, adding that it could help better serve steel mills in North China. Many of China’s steel producing capacities lie in the northern area, with top producer Hebei province along with Liaoning province together accounting for more than 30% of the national crude steel output. The first batch of iron ore fines were blended from high-grade IOC concentrate from Canada and Rio Tinto’s SP10 from Western Australia, the mining giant said. “The cooperation (with Rio Tinto) can effectively reduce the costs at both ends of the supply chain and provide more value-added services,” Zhang Yi, president of Dalian Port’s parent company Liaoning Port Group said. Dalian port has blended over 46 million tonnes of iron ore within its bonded area since 2016 when it first started the operation, the most among Chinese ports, as per the statement."
23.8311656999251," Rio Tinto has not formally committed to review threatened sites, Aboriginal group says MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Mining giant Rio Tinto RIO.AX has not formally committed to review the terms of an iron ore mine development that would let it destroy 124 culturally significant sites, a group representing Aboriginal traditional owners said on Monday. Addressing a parliamentary panel examining how Rio legally destroyed sacred and historically significant rockshelters in Western Australia state, the head of the Yinhawangka Aboriginal Corporation said Rio had stopped short of promising any review. “Rio have stated in various forums that they will consider reviewing the agreement....(but) we don’t have a formal commitment,” Chief Executive Grant Bussell told the inquiry. Rio’s Chief Executive Jean-Sebastien Jacques and two deputies said this month they would step down following a public outcry over the incident in the state’s Pilbara region, and how the company handled it. Rio had not done an adequate job of protecting an existing sacred site, Yinhawangka archaeologist Anna Fagan told the inquiry, raising concerns over how the rest of the cultural heritage would be managed. “We have 327 heritage sites and 124 will be destroyed by the Western Ranges expansion project by Rio Tinto,” she said. The inquiry has revealed that Indigenous groups have been subject to confidential contracts barring them from objecting to any mining development on their ancestral land, prompting questions over whether the miners gained full and fair consent. “No one says, in return for getting these (agreements), you don’t have any rights in protecting your country,” Bussell said. Peer BHP has promised not to act on historical approvals to damage sites while it held fresh talks with traditional owners. In a statement, Rio said it was building on decades of deep engagement as it assessed the sites to gain better understanding of “the cultural significance and values placed on these sites by the Yinhawangka People.” It added that it had committed to modernise its pacts, including details around the issue of consent, with all the groups on whose lands it operates in the Pilbara."
17.05738673347446," Miner BHP says Aboriginal landowners free to speak on how it manages cultural heritage MELBOURNE (Reuters) - BHP Group said on Wednesday the destruction of a 43,000-year old Aboriginal rock shelter in Australia by fellow miner Rio Tinto had impacted the trust between Indigenous land owners and the resource industry. It said it would halt work that could impact Aboriginal sacred sites while it consulted further with Indigenous groups and that Aboriginal owners of the land it mined were free to comment on its management of their cultural heritage. BHP will appear before an Australian parliamentary inquiry into the Rio incident on Thursday, Rio’s legal destruction of an ancient Aboriginal rock shelter at Juukan Gorge in May caused an outcry and saw its chief executive and iron ore boss step down. BHP as recently as April pressed ahead with development at its South Flank iron ore mine in the Pilbara in Western Australia state that would impact sites sacred to the Banjima people, despite their stated opposition, before freezing the work in June amid outcry over the Rio blast. “We recognise that what was lost at Juukan Gorge is not only the loss of a site of deep and unique living cultural heritage, but also a loss of trust, not just for the company involved, but with impacts for the entire resource industry,” BHP said in a statement. BHP said it would not enforce any clauses in agreements with traditional owners that may appear to restrict their right to express their concerns over BHP’s management of their heritage. “All people have the right to speak freely and publicly on matters relating to their culture and their cultural heritage including any concerns they have about impacts to cultural heritage.” As was the case at Juukan Gorge, if new information about the significance of a site was uncovered, BHP said it would also commit not to undertake activities that would disturb the site without agreement with the traditional owners. Where it had state government permission to damage significant sites, BHP said it had confirmed with traditional owner groups that it would not act without first undertaking further extensive consultation with them. It was also engaged in a number of periodic contract reviews with the Aboriginal groups on whose land it mined, it said."
16.44506106504438," UPDATE 2-FTSE 100 at 3-week high on miners; Mid-caps boosted by insurance stocks * FTSE 100 outperforms Europe’s STOXX 600 * Ocado jumps as retail sales soar * All eyes on BoE meeting on Thursday (Adds details, updates to market close) Sept 15 (Reuters) - London’s blue-chip index ended at a three-week high on Tuesday as miners were helped by upbeat Chinese industrial output data, while the mid-cap index was supported by insurers on the prospect of lower-than-expected COVID-19 payouts. A 1.3% gain in the FTSE 100 saw the index outperform its European peers, with Rio Tinto and BHP Group among the biggest boosts as data showed China’s industrial output accelerated the most in eight months in August. Online supermarket Ocado Group topped the FTSE 100 after saying its retail joint venture with Marks & Spencer posted a 52% jump in revenue in the 13 weeks to Aug. 30. The mid-cap FTSE 250 rose 0.8%, with major insurers supporting the index after a court ruling meant that some of them would have to pay much less than expected in claims to small firms battered by the coronavirus pandemic. The index, considered a barometer of Brexit sentiment, has underperformed the FTSE 100 this month following Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s plan to breach the Brexit treaty with the European Union. The proposal won initial approval in the UK parliament on Monday. “A deal is now at best a 50:50 probability,” ING economists wrote in a note. “The key factor will be whether the Internal Market Bill makes its way through the Commons and Lords successfully. If so, the EU is highly unlikely to sign a free-trade agreement.” Later in the week eyes will be on a Bank of England policy meeting, where the central bank is likely to signal more stimulus to lift the economy out of a deep recession that could be exacerbated by a messy Brexit. Britain’s jobless rate rose in the three months to July, the first such increase since coronavirus-led lockdowns began in March, but data also showed a less severe fall in employment than feared.

16.44506106504438," Australia's Fortescue says it won't consider heritage resolution at AGM (Reuters) - Fortescue Metals Group said on Tuesday it will not consider a shareholder resolution at its annual general meeting that called on the iron ore miner to halt activities that could damage Aboriginal cultural heritage sites. The move comes on the heels of growing scrutiny on resource projects in Western Australia and other parts of the country that could affect places of cultural significance, after global miner Rio Tinto legally blew up a rock shelter in May that showed 46,000 years of human habitation. The world’s fourth-biggest iron ore miner said it respects the right of shareholders to demand resolutions, but will not consider them at the annual shareholder meeting to be held on Nov. 11 as the notice was received after the cut-off date. A shareholder group backed by Aboriginal leaders appealed to Fortescue last week to commit not to damage or disturb cultural heritage sites and lift any confidentiality provisions for traditional owners. Fortescue received the documents electronically ahead of the deadline, but the physical shipment was delayed for pandemic-related reasons beyond the courier’s control, said Brynn O’Brien, executive director of the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, which filed the resolution. Its decision not to accept the resolution that would have allowed greater shareholder scrutiny around its relationships with traditional owners was “out of step with community and investor expectations,” she said in a statement. The company has said it will review mining plans at its Solomon iron ore mine expansion in Western Australia after an Indigenous group raised concerns about the threat to sacred sites, including a 60,000-year old rock shelter."
16.44506106504438," Breakingviews - Rio Tinto gets bad recruitment steer from Canberra HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - Rio Tinto’s job recruitment ad is getting some unhelpful input from Canberra. Australia’s treasurer wants the miner’s next chief executive and the majority of its board to be Australian, after Frenchman Jean-Sebastien Jacques stepped down over the destruction of an Aboriginal site. Cultural sensitivity is a priority, but the goal can be achieved in other ways. Shareholders deserve the best boss Rio can find. There are undoubtedly strong homegrown candidates available to replace Jacques, and they should be considered. At the same time, it is also not a foregone conclusion that every Australian executive will necessarily be more attuned to the issues surrounding Indigenous peoples. The $107 billion company also depends heavily on China for exports, so someone well-versed in that culture might be valued, too. And two-thirds of its shareholders are outside the country, making international nous relevant. The Juukan Gorge rock shelters fiasco cannot entirely be pinned on Rio’s lack of Australian influence either. For one thing, the move to blast them was cleared by Australian courts. The company also had five Australian citizens on the board and four on the executive committee. Rio says 40% of its top 80 managers are locals. The lack of Aboriginal managers may have been the larger issue, one the company is now devoting $50 million to address. Instead of properly diagnosing the problem, politicians are using this episode as an opportunity to push for dual-listed, London-headquartered Rio to become more Australian, like rival BHP. Restricting the field of CEO applicants by nationality, however, potentially jeopardises the company’s profitability. The government has a vested interest in that outcome, too. Rio is one of Australia’s biggest corporate taxpayers."

The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) LAUNCESTON, Australia, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Rio Tinto’s board may have stemmed the bleeding of the mining giant’s public image with the belated dumping of Chief Executive Jean-Sébastien Jacques after a widely-panned initial punishment for blowing up two significant Aboriginal rockshelters. Jacques, along with iron ore boss Chris Salisbury and Simone Niven, head of corporate relations, the unit responsible for dealing with indigenous communities, will depart in the wake of the fallout over the destruction of the caves at an iron ore mine in Western Australia state. But if Rio’s board of directors thinks this is the end of the issue, they are likely to be mistaken -- and they are also likely to face increasing scrutiny of their own role in the saga. The destruction of the caves at Juukan Gorge wasn’t illegal, but it drew the ire of the local Aboriginal people, and the concern over Rio’s actions didn’t take long to spread to investors, politicians and the wider public. The company’s board initially responded by cutting the bonuses of Jacques and the other executives, apologising and promising new procedures to ensure something similar didn’t happen again. But these moves were condemned by investors and activists as a mere slap on the wrist, and a sign that Rio still didn’t really understand the importance of community relations. The question that should be asked is whether Rio’s board has the right people to drive a process whereby environment, social and governance (ESG) issues are placed at the heart of the organisation. This is a question that should also be extended to Rio’s global peers, such as BHP Group, Glencore and Anglo American. Looking at the independent directors of these four global mining titans reveals that while they have made some progress on gender and racial diversity, most of the directors have similar backgrounds, raising the possibility of group thinking. The independent directors of Rio include three people with investment banking backgrounds, four from oil and gas, one geologist, one former public servant/diplomat and one academic, with a background in public policy. BHP’s board has three directors with diverse manufacturing and industry backgrounds, three mining executives, a former oil and gas executive, two investment bankers and an executive with a technology background. Glencore and Anglo American have a largely similar collection of independent directors, with industry, mining and banking backgrounds. This doesn’t suggest these directors don’t have valuable skills, but they may lack the sort of experience that comes with handling complex ESG issues. Imagine for a moment how the conversation may have gone when the Rio board discussed what action to take against Jacques and the other executives in the wake of Juukan Gorge cave blasts. Was there any board member with the necessary experience to recognise that Rio would be flayed in the media, did anyone ask how would this be perceived by investors and the wider public? It may well be the case that there was vigorous and heated discussion among Rio’s directors, but the initial response showed they didn’t understand the depth of the problem they were dealing with. What the board probably needed was somebody akin to the Israeli “tenth man” theory, a so-called devil’s advocate who is able to present a completely contrarian position to what the rest of the board may think. But for such a director to function effectively, they would have to come from a background very different to the majority of Rio’s current independent directors. They could not be part of what may be termed the “directors club,” where people sit on multiple boards of top-flight companies. They could not be an executive from the same industry, or indeed from related industries, and they couldn’t be an investment banker, lawyer or accountant. One suggestion is to appoint a recently retired senior business journalist or editor, somebody whose first instinct is to ask: “How would I report this decision, what would I ask the chairman and the chief executive?” Business leaders, by nature of the still largely hierarchal nature of their organisations, are more used to people telling them what they want to hear and having people agree with them. Somebody who has spent a career questioning what they are being told, challenging corporate public relations-speak and focusing on the real importance of issues would be of extreme value to a board. It’s relatively easy, and comfortable for the existing board, to find like-minded people with extensive business experience to help steer and oversee a diverse business such as Rio. Finding somebody to constantly challenge the board, the management and their decisions would be far harder, and less comfortable for the incumbents. But until companies like Rio realise the game has changed, and ESG likely will become the main driver of their business success, they are likely to prove unwilling to make the dramatic changes the situation clearly justifies.

15.921178963292485," Gold Fields reviewing approvals given at Australian sites after Rio Tinto cave blast JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Miner Gold Fields GFIJ.J said on Friday it was reviewing the approvals given to each of its Australian sites after Rio Tinto RIO.AX destroyed historically significant Aboriginal rockshelters which led to the resignation of its chief executive. Rio Tinto said earlier on Friday chief executive Jean-Sébastien Jacques and two other executives would step down following an outcry over its decision in May to detonate part of an ancient gorge that showed 46,000 years of human habitation. Gold Fields, which has operations in Australia including its Granny Smith and Gruyere mines, said it was already acting in response to the situation its rival had found itself in. “As a result of the Rio incident, two months ago we initiated a review of previous legal approvals that each Australian site had received from the regulator,” Gold Fields spokesman Sven Lunsche said in response to questions from Reuters on its approach to the heritage issue. The company said it was determining which approvals would require further engagement with Indigenous stakeholders if they were to mine or explore in the areas. “We have also undertaken a review of the gaps identified in Gold Fields’ heritage management processes as part of a critical control audit in late 2019, with a particular focus on relationships with Aboriginal stakeholders,” Lunsche said. Johannesburg-listed Gold Fields said it was closely following a review of relevant state and national legislation initiated by the Australian government. “In our other countries of operation we don’t mine in areas that are culturally sensitive,” said Lunsche. The gold miner also operates in South Africa, West Africa, Chile and Peru. Local rival AngloGold Ashanti ANGJ.J, which has two operations in Australia, declined to comment. The blasts drew international condemnation and damaged Rio Tinto’s reputation for its dealings with indigenous groups in its worldwide operations. The backlash has also resonated across boardrooms, with billions of dollars poured into companies based on environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors giving ethically-minded investors greater influence in how companies handle corporate crises."
15.921178963292485," Rio Tinto exits seen reverberating across boardrooms SYDNEY/LONDON (Reuters) - The departure of Rio Tinto Chief Executive Jean-Sebastien Jacques over the destruction of ancient Aboriginal heritage sites in Australia has put mining executives globally on notice – ignore cultural and social issues at your peril. Tens of billions of dollars have been poured into companies based on environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors giving ethically-minded investors greater clout in how companies handle corporate crises. Jacques and two deputies resigned on Friday after weeks of shareholder pressure over what was seen as the miner’s inadequate initial response to the destruction of the rockshelters - a board-led inquiry found no single individual was at fault and reprimanded the three senior executives by trimming bonus payments. “For the CEO and a couple of senior management to go over an ESG issue, it’s just going to reverberate through board rooms throughout the resource sector,” said Ben Cleary, a partner at Tribeca Investment Partners. The backlash over the destruction of the rockshelters coincided with protests in the United States over racial injustice and became one facet of the Black Lives Matter demonstrations in Australia. As companies in the United States and elsewhere grapple with addressing racism and inequality, social issues -- the S in ESG -- are gaining traction where once climate change and executive pay -- the E and G -- dominated. In ESG investing, fund managers talk about a company’s ‘social license’. Unlike a legal license, the social license is an intangible asset based on the company’s ESG reputation. “Reputation is now the thin red line between license to operate and failure,” said Neville White, Head of Responsible Investment Policy & Research at Edentree Investment Management. “The Board has not acquitted itself with glory especially by assuming a financial penalty would be enough - placing a value on the irreplaceable added insult to their destructive injury.” One London-based fund manager, who declined to be named, said miners globally were going to have to be more mindful of the impact of their operations on indigenous people. Rio chairman Simon Thompson said on Friday that what happened at the site had been wrong and that the company was “determined to ensure that the destruction of a heritage site of such exceptional archaeological and cultural significance never occurs again”. Rio’s detonations, which allowed it to access higher grade iron ore, came amid a wider movement in Australia focused on the treatment of Aboriginal groups, who fall behind the general population on markers ranging from child mortality to literacy. Land rights barrister Greg McIntyre said it was too early to say whether Rio’s move signalled a turning point in relation to dealings with Aboriginal groups. “What it does indicate is that this issue is being taken seriously, which is a positive development, but it’s not a solution to the problem.”"
15.921178963292485," Rio Tinto bows to pressure over cave blast as CEO, executives exit MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Rio Tinto RIO.AX parted ways with its chief executive and two deputies on Friday, bowing to a shareholder outcry over the destruction of two significant Aboriginal rockshelters and what was seen as the miner's inadequate initial response. The departures are the highest profile examples yet of the increasing muscle of institutional investors to hold companies to account for actions that fall short in areas such as human rights obligations and expected community standards. They also come amid heightened sensitivity in Australia to its treatment of Aboriginal people, who are over represented in the country’s prisons and suffer poorer health and shorter average life spans. Chief Executive Jean-Sébastien Jacques, who has led Rio since 2016, will step down by March 31 next year, while iron ore boss, Chris Salisbury, and Simone Niven, head of corporate relations, the unit responsible for dealing with indigenous communities, will also depart. The executive changes “should be a wake up call for the Australian iron ore sector and mining companies worldwide on their relationships with First Nations people,” said Brynn O’Brien, executive director of activist investor the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility. Activists and investors said Rio had fallen short in an earlier board-led review into how the miner legally detonated rockshelters showing 46,000 years of human habitation at Juukan Gorge in Western Australia against the wishes of traditional owners. The review had recommended cutting short-term bonuses for some executives. Australia’s largest pension fund, AustralianSuper said it was satisfied that “appropriate responsibility” had now been taken by Rio Tinto executives, although it added that nothing could undo the destruction of the culturally significant sites. Others suggested further action was likely. “(This) is the right outcome and raises the question about what happens next at the board level,” said analyst Peter O’Connor of broker Shaw and Partners. “I don’t think it’s over yet.” Jacques last month apologised at an Australian Senate enquiry into the destruction of the caves, saying there was no doubt the company could have made better decisions. The blasts, which enabled Rio to access $135 million of high-grade iron ore, drew international condemnation and damaged the miner’s reputation for dealing with indigenous groups in its worldwide operations. “What happened at Juukan was wrong and we are determined to ensure that the destruction of a heritage site of such exceptional archaeological and cultural significance never occurs again at a Rio Tinto operation,” Rio chairman Simon Thompson said on Friday. The traditional owners of the land, the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP) people said they had no comment on the executive changes, but would continue to work with Rio Tinto. “We cannot and will not allow this type of devastation to occur ever again,” the PKKP said in a statement. Rio said a search was already underway to replace Jacques. The board praised his leadership and pointed to his sale of the group’s coal assets, development of a climate change strategy and strong shareholder returns under his tenure. Rio shares drifted down 0.7 percent in Australian trade, in line with a softer broader market. The controversy, meanwhile, has spilled over to the rest of the sector, with BHP Group BHP.AX and Fortescue Metals Group FMG.AX both pledging to review mine plans that could threaten sacred sites as they step up talks with traditional owners. Submissions to the Senate inquiry, which has been pushed out to December due to coronavirus induced travel bans, have shone a light on the power imbalances between miners and traditional owners in their agreements. The inquiry will consider legislative changes required to prevent such incidents from recurring. Western Australian state laws that approved the destruction are also being revised. Representing traditional owners, The National Native Title Council (NNTC) welcomed the move but called for further law reform. “Traditional owners are not anti-economic development. They just want to be able to protect their most significant cultural heritage sites.” ($1 = 1.3774 Australian dollars)"
15.921178963292485," Factbox: Australian resource projects in focus after sacred site destruction SYDNEY (Reuters) - The destruction of sacred sites in Western Australia by mining giant Rio Tinto has increased scrutiny on resource projects in other parts of the country that could affect places of cultural significance. Rio Tinto on Friday said Chief Executive Jean-Sébastien Jacques will step down by March 31 next year, after shareholders expressed concerns about executive accountability. Since July 2010, miners have submitted more than 460 applications to disturb or destroy sites of potential cultural significance in the region. All but one of those applications were approved. However, Australia’s largest resource companies say they are now taking another look at projects that could affect sacred sites: -- BHP Group said it would not disturb any sites around its planned $2.9 billion South Flank expansion in Western Australia without further study and consultation with traditional owners to understand the cultural significance of the area. -- Fortescue Metals Group, the world’s fourth biggest iron ore miner, will review plans at its Solomon iron ore mine expansion in Western Australia after an Indigenous group said a planned expansion threatened sacred sites, including a 60,000-year old rock shelter. -- Rio Tinto has pledged to protect a 43,000-year old rock shelter on the fringe of its Silvergrass iron ore mine in Western Australia as it reviews heritage sites. -- Woodside Petroleum is in talks with the Murujuga Aboriginal Corp about a proposed gas pipeline which it plans to run 5 kms (3 miles) west of two sites where archaeologists recently discovered hundreds of ancient stone tools. The traditional owners are pressing the company to do a thorough investigation to ensure there aren’t other underwater heritage sites in the area before it goes ahead."
15.921178963292485," Rio Tinto may need to tap outsider for new chief MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Four years after mining giant Rio Tinto swept out its veteran managers to make way for a new generation of business heads, its leadership team has come unstuck. The world’s biggest iron ore miner is looking for a new chief and iron ore boss after they allowed the blasting of ancient Aboriginal rock shelters to expand a mine in Western Australia against the wishes of the traditional owners. Investors and analysts saw no clear internal candidates and said following the damage done to the company’s reputation, it was likely Rio would tap an outsider to replace Frenchman Jean-Sébastien Jacques. “Clearly from the comments of the chairman they want to reset the culture, which would imply an external candidate would be more likely than an internal one,” said Macquarie analyst Hayden Bairstow. Chairman Simon Thompson said on Friday the company was determined to “re-establish our reputation as a leader in communities and heritage management”. Aside from repairing the company’s community relations, the board will need to look for someone who refocuses on operations and building the copper business, areas neglected as Jacques stripped out layers of management and focused on capital allocation, two fund managers said. “Rio was the benchmark for operations, but in the last 18 months they’ve lost that title,” said an investment manager who declined to be named. Potential external candidates that analysts and investors pointed to included Anglo American CEO Mark Cutifani, Orica CEO Alberto Calderon, former Fortescue Metals Group boss Nev Power, and ex-Shell Australia chair Zoe Yujnovich, who previously ran Rio’s Canadian iron ore business. “Zoe has the relevant mining background, international management experience, government relationships, acute sensitivity to indigenous and remote community engagement, and strong Australian roots,” said one analyst, who declined to be named as he does not cover Rio. If the company wants to overhaul its culture, it might be tough to turn to former Rio executives, although several were seen as potential candidates: Newcrest Mining Chief Executive Sandeep Biswas, Aurizon CEO Andrew Harding, OZ Minerals CEO Andrew Cole and Fortescue Chief Operating Officer Greg Lilleyman. One fund manager pointed to Rio’s aluminium chief Alf Barrios as a potential candidate. However analysts said the company may want to look beyond mining expertise to set a new vision for the company. “You don’t need to be able to do a mine plan for an iron ore pit to run Rio Tinto.

The global miner said on Friday chief executive Jean-Sébastien Jacques and two other executives would step down following an outcry over its decision to detonate part of an ancient gorge that showed 46,000 years of human habitation. The move comes as investors are demanding increased transparency in how companies manage environmental, social and governance (ESG) risks, said Danielle Welsh-Rose, Aberdeen Standard Investments ESG Investment Director, Asia Pacific. “The leadership changes at Rio Tinto today are significant in many ways, including showing that investors and other stakeholders will hold companies to account on their ESG performance,” she said. Rio had been slow to recognise the importance of ESG issues following recent banking scandals in Australia, said Vas Kolesnikoff, Australian head of governance adviser ISS. “This is the social licence to operate. If you don’t adhere to appropriate conduct and standards you’re going to fall foul of investors,” he said. Ben Cleary, a partner at Tribeca Investment Partners said the Rio departures were a big moment for the mining industry. “For the CEO and a couple of senior management to go over an ESG issue, it’s just going to reverberate through board rooms throughout the resource sector,” he said, adding that it could slow down the sector. Rio’s detonations, which allowed it to access higher grade ore, also came amid a wider movement in Australia focused on the treatment of Aboriginal groups, who fall behind the general population on markers ranging from child mortality to literacy. Land rights barrister Greg McIntyre said it was too early to say whether Rio’s move signalled a turning point in relation to dealings with Aboriginal groups. “What it does indicate is that this issue is being taken seriously, which is a positive development, but it’s not a solution to the problem.”"
15.921178963292485," Rio Tinto may need to tap outsider for new chief MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Four years after mining giant Rio Tinto swept out its veteran managers to make way for a new generation of business heads, its leadership team has come unstuck. The world’s biggest iron ore miner is looking for a new chief and iron ore boss after they allowed the blasting of ancient Aboriginal rock shelters to expand a mine in Western Australia against the wishes of the traditional owners. Investors and analysts saw no clear internal candidates and said following the damage done to the company’s reputation, it was likely Rio would tap an outsider to replace Frenchman Jean-Sébastien Jacques. “Clearly from the comments of the chairman they want to reset the culture, which would imply an external candidate would be more likely than an internal one,” said Macquarie analyst Hayden Bairstow. Chairman Simon Thompson said on Friday the company was determined to “re-establish our reputation as a leader in communities and heritage management”. Potential external candidates that analysts and investors pointed to included Anglo American CEO Mark Cutifani, Orica CEO Alberto Calderon, former Fortescue Metals Group boss Nev Power, and ex-Shell Australia chair Zoe Yujnovich, who previously ran Rio’s Canadian iron ore business. “Zoe has the relevant mining background, international management experience, government relationships, acute sensitivity to indigenous and remote community engagement, and strong Australian roots,” said one analyst, who declined to be named as he does not cover Rio. If the company wants to overhaul its culture, it might be tough to turn to former Rio executives, although several were seen as potential candidates: Newcrest Mining Chief Executive Sandeep Biswas, Aurizon CEO Andrew Harding, OZ Minerals CEO Andrew Cole and Fortescue Chief Operating Officer Greg Lilleyman. However analysts said the company may want to look beyond mining expertise to set a new vision for the company. “You don’t need to be able to do a mine plan for an iron ore pit to run Rio Tinto. Look at (former travel industry executive) Elizabeth Gaines’ success at Fortescue,” Bairstow said."
15.921178963292485," Breakingviews - Rio Tinto rebellion sets new ESG bar HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - Rio Tinto’s recklessness has set a welcome new bar for environmental, social and corporate governance. Boss Jean-Sebastien Jacques and two deputies, including the head of its iron ore unit which accounted for 96% of half-year earnings, will step down after outcry over the $105 billion miner’s destruction of a 46,000-year-old Aboriginal heritage site in Western Australia. Local activists and shareholders, including the country’s powerful superannuation funds, have led a charge that will inspire other socially-conscious investors. Pressure had been building since the company released an internal review into how the Juukan Gorge’s sacred rockshelters were blown up in May to expand an iron ore mine. The demolition had legal clearance but it went ahead despite a 2018 report commissioned by the company itself, warning that parts of the area were of “the highest archaeological significance”. Jacques is a larger-than-expected scalp but his defence that he didn’t know about the importance of the site until it was too late exposed deeper problems in the company’s corporate culture. In the context of other recent high-profile scandals of misbehaving bosses Down Under, including at storied wealth manager AMP, and with shareholder pressure, Rio’s board evidently concluded that a management clear-out was the only way to move forward. The exits are nonetheless a loss for the company. During Jacques’ four year tenure, dual-listed Rio delivered total returns of 183% and 229% to its London and Sydney shareholders. That trounces the local benchmark indexes and outperforms rival BHP. And while Rio’s generous dividends and soaring share prices were driven by voracious Chinese demand for iron ore, Jacques steered clear of acquisition sprees - a common pitfall in the sector - and made the prescient decision to exit coal, putting it on a greener path. The episode is another turning point in the push for greater accountability in ESG. Rio may have thought it was just blowing up some caves but ended up blowing up its management through multiple governance failures. Bosses and boards hiding behind strong returns have been given notice."

21.497784589701645," Pressure mounts for Rio board after Australian cave blast review MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australian superannuation fund Hesta has become the latest investor to voice dissatisfaction over the findings of Rio Tinto’s board-led review into how the iron ore miner legally detonated historically significant Aboriginal rockshelters. The comments come as Rio Tinto is expected to update investors within 24 hours on further steps that may bring more sanctions for executives, a separate Australian-based investor group told Reuters on condition of anonymity, on Thursday. Rio’s board is to meet on Thursday, the BBC has said. After an internal review of its legal destruction of the sacred sites in Western Australia for a mine expansion, Rio said it would cut the short-term bonuses of some senior officials, including chief executive Jean-Sébastien Jacques. “Accountability for the destruction at Juukan Gorge should rest at the highest levels of Rio,” Hesta said in a statement that urged an independent review of all the pacts Rio Tinto has negotiated with traditional owners. “As an investor, we have lost confidence that the company can do this on their own.” Rio declined to comment. Rio shares were up 1.4% ahead of Thursday’s events. Since the controversy broke in late May, they have gained nearly a tenth, underperforming a rise of 24% in prices of iron ore. Investors say Rio’s missteps have fuelled concern about the firm’s culture and the ability of staff to flag concerns to managers, as well as whether the board review fell short of community standards. An Australian petition to sack Jacques by activist group GetUp! has attracted 28,639 signatures. “There seems to be some consensus building around the industry funds,” said a source at an Australian asset manager who sought anonymity as the topic was sensitive. “It’s safe to say (Rio) are going to battle to avoid any structural change with management and with the board.” Pressure is also mounting from investors in Britain. “While cutting short-term bonuses of senior executivesis a symbolic step toward attributing accountability for the tragedy, there is clearly a deeper, systemic governance issue that needs to be addressed more fully and urgently,” the Local Authority Pension Fund Forum (LAPFF) said. The Forum groups 81 public sector pension funds with assets of more than 300 billion sterling ($390 billion). “To this end, LAPFF expects the Rio Tinto board to hold the appropriate parties accountable for Rio Tinto’s failings,” it said in a statement. Jacques met the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura (PKKP) people this week after a two-week quarantine, having flown from Sydney. In a statement, the PKKP said the grouping held meetings with senior executives “to share our feelings” and seek a way forward to repair and grow the relationship.

6.108122276285106," Exclusive: Rio vows to preserve ancient Australian rock shelter after outcry over caves blast MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Rio Tinto RIO.AXRIO.L has pledged to protect a 43,000-year old rock shelter on the fringe of its Silvergrass iron ore mine in Western Australia as it reviews heritage sites following outrage over the destruction of sacred ancient caves this year. Rio Tinto, which has state government approval to damage the site, told the Wintawari Guruma people, its traditional owners, of its intention to preserve the rock shelter last week, although the Wintawari say they have yet to receive confirmation in writing. “We will protect the site and also have mining buffer zones in place to further ensure the site is not at risk,” the world’s largest iron ore miner said in an e-mail in response to Reuters questions about the site. The state government-approved detonation in May of caves in the same region that showed evidence of human history stretching back 46,000 years provoked worldwide condemnation and has triggered government and internal reviews. Since then, Australia's biggest iron ore miners - Rio Tinto, BHP BHP.AXBHPB.L and Fortescue Metals Group FMG.AX - have been reviewing heritage sites that could be affected by mine expansions, although they have resisted calls for a complete moratorium on sites for which they have been granted exemptions to disturb or damage. The 43,000-year old rock shelter was highlighted in a March 2018 report by Scarp Archaeology as having “high archaeological significance”, which also noted the Silvergrass East area was “likely to feature more locations of extensive antiquity.” Despite the findings of the report, Rio Tinto applied the following April to damage the site, called SG-07-22, and consent was granted by the state government’s Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in an Aug. 15 2019-dated document that was obtained by Reuters. “Nobody at Wintawari is ever happy to see any sites destroyed - hopefully Rio is also coming around to that point of view,” said Kathryn Przywolnik, heritage manager for the Wintawari Guruma Aboriginal Corporation. “This could be a sign of Rio reviewing its decision-making process but it’s a bit early to tell.” Since July 2010, miners have submitted more than 460 applications to disturb or destroy sites of potential cultural significance in the region, according to Western Australia state parliament records. All but one of those applications were approved. The May blasts of the sacred caves, whose traditional owners are the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people, highlighted the power imbalance between miners and Indigenous Australians who have no legal veto over development projects on their ancestral land. Unlike their title suggests, traditional owners don’t own the land and are only sometimes considered stakeholders in its management. An Australian federal government inquiry that began in June has exposed controversial clauses in miners’ contracts with traditional owners that prohibit them from publicly objecting to site destruction and that may also impede their rights under other Australian legislation. Rio Tinto executives are due to give further evidence before the inquiry from late next month. The outcry over the May blasts also became one facet of the Black Lives Matter protests in Australia, where Aboriginal groups have long suffered higher rates of imprisonment, unemployment and lower life expectancy."
8.58453097398832," RPT-COLUMN-Rio Tinto's weak response to cave blasts will trigger stronger reaction: Russell (Repeating story moved earlier, no change to text) LAUNCESTON, Australia, Aug 25 (Reuters) - Rio Tinto may have inadvertently triggered the law of unintended consequences with its blasting of an Aboriginal heritage site at one of its Australian iron ore mines, and the subsequent slap on the wrists for some senior executives. The board of Rio cut the bonuses of three senior executives including Chief Executive Jean-Sébastien Jacques as part of the company’s review into the destruction of two historically significant caves in Western Australia state, against the wishes of the Aboriginal traditional owners. Rio, which overtook Brazil’s Vale as the world’s biggest iron ore miner last year, destroyed the Juukan Gorge caves in May as part of an expansion of its Brockman 4 mine. While the blasting met legal requirements, Rio has faced a public and investor backlash for allegedly putting profits ahead of heritage, a view amplified by the revelation that the company had alternatives to destroying the caves but chose not to pursue them. The Rio board review said there was no single “root cause or error” that resulted in the destruction of the caves, rather it was a “series of decisions, actions and omissions over an extended period of time.” The board recommended improving procedures and setting up new processes to ensure this type of incident doesn’t happen again. The board’s review likely fails what Australians refer to as the “pub test,” which means whether the average patrons of a typical bar believe the actions are reasonable and appropriate. The loss of about $3.7 million in bonuses for the three executives is a very mild punishment, given their level of remuneration and the fact that Jacques, along with head of iron ore Chris Salisbury and Simone Niven, the executive responsible for corporate relations, bear responsibility for what has become a public relations disaster for the company. The board’s soft-pedalling of the cave destruction was condemned by shareholder advocacy group the Australasian Corporate Centre for Responsibility, and several institutional investors. While Rio will no doubt hope the issue blows over with the passage of time, it’s more likely that it leads to a renewed focus on environment, social and governance (ESG) issues. Shareholders are becoming increasingly aware of the financial risks of companies that are viewed as not having leading ESG programmes and a culture of doing the right thing. Social licence to operate, along with climate change, comes up often as the top concerns for miners, with a survey last year by consultants EY showing 44% of mining executives viewed keeping a social licence as their top concern. Unfortunately, the Rio incident with the Juukan caves shows that miners may still have some way to go in order to be seen to be placing ESG issues at the heart of their operations. Rio isn’t alone in this, with other leading mining companies seeming to fall short in this area, despite public commitments that it is their top priority. Like Rio’s corporate affairs boss Niven, other miners have executives listed as having responsibility for ESG issues, such as outgoing BHP external affairs chief Geoff Healy, Tim Langmead at Fortescue Metals Group, Anik Michaud at Anglo American and Luiz Osorio at Vale. Glencore is unusual among major miners in not having an executive with ESG responsibilities listed on its website. But merely having an executive named doesn’t mean these people are among the most important decision makers in the companies they work for. All the executives’ names above have additional responsibilities and none of them have a public profile worth speaking about. In effect, they are largely invisible and take little or no public part in the debate over ESG issues. This hardly speaks to mining companies that appear to view ESG issues as front and centre of their existence. For companies to be taken seriously, it would likely take the appointment of senior executives, with real power over the decision-making process, to become involved in placing ESG at the heart of each company’s mission. If Rio had somebody like this, somebody could have stopped the blasting even if the CEO wanted it to proceed, somebody who understood that the negative optics of blowing up the caves considerably outweighed the potential profits, then it may have avoided the current mess. However, it’s likely that ongoing shareholder demands for increased ESG accountability, coupled with activism by interest groups, will force miners down the path of making ESG more than just the current statements of principle.

8.58453097398832," Zinc price outperforms, China steel demand a strong tailwind LONDON (Reuters) - A tailwind for zinc demand from booming Chinese steel production has pushed prices of the galvanizing metal to their highest in more than nine months and helped it outperform other metals. Yet data such as warehouse stock levels suggest further significant gains are unlikely. Massive stimulus measures by Chinese authorities to offset the damage to economic growth from COVID-19 lockdowns has boosted demand for zinc and steel. Global zinc demand is estimated at around 14 million tonnes this year. Benchmark zinc prices on the London Metal Exchange touched $2,525 a tonne this month, a gain of 11% since the start of the year compared with nearly 9% for copper and a small loss for aluminium. Graphic: Zinc outperforms “Strong galvanised steel production in China is behind zinc’s rally,” a source at a commodity trading firm said. “But LME stocks are up, meaning weakness outside China and excess supply.” Data from the World Steel Association shows global crude steel production fell 2.5% to 152.7 million tonnes in July from a year earlier, but in China output jumped more than 9% to 94.4 million tonnes. Graphic: Crude steel production “The bulk of (China’s) galvanised steel-consuming sectors such as autos and machinery are gathering momentum,” analysts at Macquarie said in a note. “We calculate using (China’s) year to date growth figure that highway investment has grown by an average of 12% since May and railway by almost 20%, despite a cooling evident in July,” the Macquarie analysts said.

Some of that surplus has already found its way to LME registered warehouses, where stocks at 224,300 tonnes compare with a number below 50,000 tonnes in February.

9.430613194656381," Rio Tinto stops short of axing leaders over sacred caves blast MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Rio Tinto said on Monday it will cut the short-term bonuses of some senior executives but stopped short of leadership overhaul following review of the company’s destruction of two ancient caves in Australia. Chief Executive Jean-Sébastien Jacques and two other leaders will take financial penalties after the world’s biggest iron ore miner legally destroyed two historically significant sacred caves in Western Australia state - against the wishes of Aboriginal traditional owners - as part of a mine expansion. Rio said it would reduce the short-term bonuses of Jacques, Chief Executive of Iron Ore Chris Salisbury and Group Executive, Corporate Relations, Simone Niven in 2020 by about $3.7 million in total. Jacques’ long-term incentive plan award would also be reduced by about 1 million pounds ($1.3 million). He was paid 5.8 million pounds last year. “The Rio Tinto board has come to an informed judgment that the sanctions that have been applied to senior executives are appropriate,” Michael L’Estrange, who led the review, told Reuters. The destruction in May sparked public outrage and an Australian government enquiry that senior Rio leadership faced early this month. The penalties were well short of management change pushed for by some investor groups who have criticised Rio’s leadership for a lack of accountability. “Irreplaceable cultural heritage has been lost and the only consequence for any of the senior leadership at Rio is the loss of a bonus — not even their job,” said shareholder advocacy group the Australasian Corporate Centre for Responsibility. “Rio’s board could have acted decisively. This soft touch, public relations-oriented review calls into question the suitability of every board member, especially the Chair Simon Thompson and the head of the review Michael L’Estrange.” L’Estrange told Reuters he was confident Rio’s board had made the correct decision that was in line with community expectations, even as investor pressure on boards for greater accountability grows. “The board has thought very, very deeply on this... Now we will consult with investors and others,” he said. Australian wealth manager AMP Ltd saw a leadership shakeup on Monday after investors were unhappy with board decisions around accountability over allegations of inappropriate conduct. “The review found no single root cause or error that directly resulted in the destruction of the rockshelters. It was the result of a series of decisions, actions and omissions over an extended period of time,” Rio said. The Aboriginal traditional owners, the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people did not comment. They have previously said they were too distressed to comment. Rio is reviewing the organisational structure of its communities function that will report to Mark Davies, who joined the executive committee in charge of safety and technical projects in July, after it previously reported to corporate affairs. The miner also said that it was reviewing the terms of its existing 2011 agreement with the PKKP, in relation to consent to “reflect evolving practice.” Rio did not tell the PKKP, the traditional owners of the two caves destroyed to mine iron ore, about three alternative mine plans, Jacques told the government enquiry, despite saying it had won fully informed consent for blasting."

2.203986510575926," Column: BHP and Rio show the swings and arrows of China commodity exposure - Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - It may be a bit of an oversimplification, but in the current situation of the global coronavirus pandemic the world of commodities is effectively split between China and the rest. Nowhere is this more clearly illustrated than in the results of top global miners BHP Group and Rio Tinto. BHP, the world’s biggest miner with a broad portfolio of quality assets, missed analysts’ estimates in reporting a 4% drop in annual profits on Aug. 18. BHP reported underlying profit attributable from continuing operations for the year ended June 30 of $9.06 billion - below estimates of $9.42 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data. “With the exception of China, the world’s major economies will contract during the 2020 calendar year as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,” Chief Executive Mike Henry said in a statement. Looking at the details of BHP’s results shows that the standout performer was iron ore, providing 64% of the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for the world’s third-largest producer of the steel-making ingredient. China buys more than two-thirds of the global seaborne trade in iron ore, making it the major commodity most exposed to the Chinese economy. It’s also worth noting that BHP’s return on capital employed was 56% for iron ore, but only 12% for metallurgical coal, 7% for copper and 6% for petroleum. While China has been boosting imports of most major commodities as its economy recovers from the coronavirus shutdowns of the first quarter, it’s iron ore that has been the biggest beneficiary. Spot 62% iron ore for delivery to north China, as assessed by commodity price reporting agency Argus, rose to a 6 1/2-year high of $128.20 a tonne on Wednesday. It is now up 62% from its low so far this year of $79.60 on March 23, and 41% from the end of last year. This makes iron ore the best performing major commodity, leaving behind even the market darling gold, which had gained 27% from the end of last year to its close of $1,929.54 an ounce on Wednesday. It’s therefore little surprise that Rio Tinto, which is poised to overtake Brazil’s Vale as the world’s top iron ore miner, performed so strongly it its first-half results, announced on July 29. The Anglo-Australian miner reported underlying half-year earnings of $4.75 billion, beating the analysts’ consensus forecast of $4.36 billion. Unsurprisingly, Chief Executive Jean-Sébastien Jacques was talking up China’s V-shaped economic recovery. “We believe that China has enjoyed a very steep V-shaped recovery. Today we see it as that the demand for steel and iron ore in China is very, very strong and order books are full,” Jacques said. The risk for Rio is that it becomes a one-trick pony, as iron ore accounted for 96% of its underlying earnings in the first half. Rio is also a major producer of copper, aluminium, diamonds and uranium, but in the current environment, these assets may as well not be there, at least from a profit-contributing perspective. Rio’s return on capital employed was 64% for iron ore, 3% for aluminium, 1% on copper and diamonds and 10% for what it calls its energy and minerals, which includes uranium, iron ore pellets and borates. However, while it’s clear that Rio is heavily dependent on iron ore, this will likely work in its favour for as long as China’s economy is surging, while the rest of the world is still battling to control the pandemic. Rio’s first half average price for iron ore was $85.10 a tonne, and the company said that for every 10% change in prices, it would gain, or lose, $1.892 billion. Given that the spot iron ore price has been above $100 a tonne since July 3, Rio stands to rake in billions more in the second half, even if the price doesn’t hold around current levels and eases somewhat as more supply from Brazil returns to the market. For BHP the outlook is trickier. BHP’s more diversified portfolio should stand it in good stead if the rest of the global economy performs better in 2021, based on the assumption that the coronavirus can be contained, or neutralised by a vaccine.

The Anglo-Australian miner said the delays in restarting the smelter at its Kennecott mine were due to planned maintenance and expected it to be running in two months. Full-year refined copper production is now expected to be between 135,000 tonnes and 175,000 tonnes, lower than its previous range of 165,000 tonnes to 205,000 tonnes. Rio Tinto reported a better-than-expected first-half profit last month, boosted by firm prices for iron ore and higher output as Chinese demand for the steel-making ingredient recovered from a coronavirus hit."

Rio chief executive Jean-Sébastien Jacques was grilled by an Australian Senate panel on Friday over how the company had legally destroyed two prehistoric rock shelters, causing deep distress to their Aboriginal owners. Jacques told the inquiry that neither he nor other senior leaders had read a key archaeological report outlining the significance of a rock shelter showing continual human habitation before the last ice age 46,000 years ago. “The fact that Rio Tinto’s senior management had not reviewed a critical report about the site itself calls into question the company’s governance and oversight processes,” Councillor Doug McMurdo, chair of Local Authority Pension Fund Forum (LAPFF), said in a statement. “If there had been an effective community engagement process in place, it is hard to see how this tragedy could have occurred.” LAPFF represents 81 British public sector pension funds with assets of 300 billion sterling ($392.07 billion).

-0.1968865715472006," Rio Tinto didn't inform cave blast owners of other mine plans: CEO MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Rio Tinto RIO.AX did not tell Aboriginal traditional owners of two ancient caves destroyed to mine iron ore about three alternative mine plans, its CEO told an inquiry on Friday, despite saying it had won fully informed consent for blasting. Rio Tinto CEO Jean-Sébastien Jacques faced an Australian Senate inquiry after the miner in late May legally destroyed the sacred caves which sat atop a high grade ore body it planned to mine, against the wishes of the traditional owners. The destruction of the sites, which showed evidence of 46,000 years of human habitation, fuelled a public furore and became a facet of Black Lives Matter protests in Australia, sparking the parliamentary inquiry. Jacques, who apologised at the start of the hearing for the destruction of the site, said the company had four options for its mine plan and chose the most valuable one, which gave it access to $135 million of ore. “The difference between option 4 and the other three options was in the vicinity of 8 million tonnes of high grade iron ore. The economic value at the time of the decision ... was around $135 million of net present value,” he said. Jacques also confirmed that the Puutu Kunti, Kurama and Pinikura (PKKP) people were not made aware that the iron ore giant had considered three other mine plans, but were only presented with the option that would destroy the caves. “How could it be possibly be seen that they were given free, prior and informed consent under those circumstances?” Senator Warren Snowden asked. Rio had said in a submission to the inquiry that it believed it had obtained free, prior and informed consent from the PKKP, a United Nations-backed principle on the rights of indigenous peoples that the miner has pledged to uphold. Jacques told the inquiry there was no doubt the company could have made better decisions. “This is a defining moment for Rio Tinto. We are absolutely committed to learn and change,” he said. He stopped short of explicitly committing to absolve traditional owner groups from historic agreements that restrict them from publicly objecting to mining development on their land. Critics say such agreements, which are widespread in Western Australia, mean traditional owners are unable to raise concerns when government officials call for public objections to inform their decisions over whether to allow a site to be destroyed. Rio Tinto, which has faced criticism from major shareholders over the blasts, is conducting its own independent board review into the incident, due to be completed in October. It has pledged to make the findings public. The Senate inquiry chairman Warren Entsch indicated that Rio would likely be called back to a later hearing."

The Anglo-Australian miner has already invested $450 million into the project and is hoping to complete the study and design work for the project by the end of next year as the world grows more environmentally-conscious. “We look forward to working closely with the Government of Serbia over the next eighteen months as we develop and validate our understanding of the project to the point when we can seek a final investment decision by the Board of Rio Tinto,” Bold Baatar, Rio’s energy and minerals chief executive said. The project in the western Serbian city of Loznica will include an underground mine and an industrial processing facility. “Rio Tinto’s lithium project pipeline is an important part of our vision to pursue opportunities which are part of the transition to a low-carbon future,” Baatar added in a statement.

-7.398435003769317," Rio Tinto touts 'V-shaped' China recovery as it beats profit expectations MELBOURNE - (Reuters) - Rio Tinto said on Wednesday it saw a sharp V-shaped recovery in China as stimulus spurred industrial activity, helping its first-half profit handily beat market expectations. Rio Tinto is the first of the major iron ore miners to report results from a first half marked by coronavirus-induced disruptions but also by high iron ore prices. “We believe that China has enjoyed a very steep V-shaped recovery,” CEO Jean-Sébastien Jacques said on a call. “Today we see it as that the demand for steel and iron ore in China is very, very strong and order books are full,” Jacques said. That rebound helped it report half-year underlying earnings of $4.75 billion, beating a consensus of $4.36 billion from 16 analysts compiled by Vuma. Iron ore accounted for 96% of Rio’s underlying earnings. Rio is the world’s largest iron ore miner. It declared a record dividend of $1.55 per share, up from $1.51 last year and bang on expectations but refrained from paying out a special dividend as some analysts had hoped, suggesting a more cautious view for the remainder of the year. “Rio’s resilience and the very strong balance sheet supports the small increase in the dividend,” said Richard Marwood, senior fund manager at Royal London Asset Management, which holds shares in the miner. “Commodity prices will be driven by the shape of the global economic recovery, but Rio is well placed to cope with whatever comes next, given its strong finances and high quality asset base.” Rio’s London-listed shares were up 1.5% by 1040 GMT, outpacing a 0.6% rise in the wider market. Graphic: Rio Tinto outpaces peers this year - The demand recovery story outside China remained uncertain, Jacques said. “In other major economies like the U.S and Europe, the recovery is much more tentative,” he said. “Big questions remain over the trajectory of consumer spending globally in the face of significant levels of unemployment.” Rio said in its earnings statement that it had taken a $1 billion impairment charge, largely related to four of its aluminium smelters as well as its Diavik diamond mine in Canada. High power prices forced Rio to close its New Zealand smelter this year and to ask Icelandic regulators to address what it called discriminatory power pricing for its ISAL smelter. Its Australian aluminium businesses remains under review. “We are having a lot of private conversations for all our smelters in Aus. Those are challenging conversations, there is no doubt about it, and we are working hard in order to find a solution,” Jacques said. Free cash flow tumbled 28% as the miner spent more on development projects and tax payments, but analysts at Jefferies remained upbeat about its prospects. Higher metal prices and relatively stable unit costs should help free cash flow improve sequentially in the second half, they said, and suggested Rio could pay a special dividend with its full-year results. “We have continued to pay the same level of taxes, same level of employment, the same dividend,” Chief Financial Officer Jakob Stausholm told Reuters. “But for a special dividend, it’s better to wait a moment to make such considerations.” Jacques said he will front an Australian Senate enquiry next week over Rio’s destruction of two sacred caves of historic significance in Western Australia. The results from a separate board-led review into the incident is due to conclude in October. Rio expects Guinea’s giant Simandou iron ore reserve to be developed, as China looks to diversify its sourcing away from the Australians and Vale in Brazil. Guinea in June signed an agreement with a consortium for the development of the giant reserve after it won a $14 billion tender last November to develop the blocks which hold more than 2 billion tonnes of high-grade ore."

0.5659454165265471," Rio Tinto posts strong second quarter iron ore shipments, sees China demand recovery MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Rio Tinto on Friday reported a 1.5% rise in iron ore shipments for the second quarter and said demand for the steelmaking ingredient was improving in China as its economy recovers from the coronavirus outbreak. The world’s largest iron ore miner shipped 86.7 million tonnes of the commodity in the quarter ended June 30, beating a Vuma consensus of 84.1 million tonnes, and up from 85.4 million tonnes a year earlier. “Iron ore, then maybe copper, ali (aluminium), all of those were in line or better. I don’t think you can get too upset with the quarterly - time to move on,” said analyst Glyn Lawcock of UBS. Demand for iron ore has remained resilient this year, even in the face of an unfolding global recession, as Beijing ramps up infrastructure spending to combat the shock from the COVID-19 crisis. “Our iron ore assets are performing well in a strong pricing environment and we are on track to meet our 2020 iron ore guidance,” Chief Executive Jean-Sébastien Jacques said. Iron ore typically accounts for more than 80% of Rio’s underlying earnings. The miner said conditions in China had improved across the second quarter and appeared to be stabilising, with construction and infrastructure sectors performing well. Rio, however, cautioned that a second wave of infections remains a key threat for advanced economies. The global miner reported stronger-than-expected mined copper output following an earthquake at its Utah operations. Total mined copper production of 132,800 tonnes beat consensus of 114,000 tonnes, and was down just 3% on a year ago. Iron ore output stood at 83.2 million tonnes, 4% higher from a year earlier. Bauxite production at 14.6 million tonnes, was up 9% from last year while aluminium output stood at 785,000 tonnes, down 2% from 2019."
9.759141871187285," Rio Tinto to shutter New Zealand aluminium smelter, putting jobs and economy in peril (Reuters) - Rio Tinto said on Thursday it will close its aluminium smelter operation in New Zealand due to high costs and a challenging market, putting over a thousand jobs on the line and dealing a blow to the country’s top power producers. The closure of the New Zealand Aluminium Smelters venture, which is the country’s single largest power user, comes amid forecasts of massive job losses and a looming recession in New Zealand, with the economy crippled by tough restrictions to beat the spread of the coronavirus. It also puts pressure on Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who launched her re-election bid just last week, promising more jobs and financial assistance to businesses. Finance Minister Grant Robertson said the decision by Rio Tinto, the world’s biggest iron ore miner, was “disappointing” and the timing could not be worse. “Given the challenging economic situation caused by COVID-19 it is disappointing Rio Tinto has chosen to close the smelter at this time, especially given the support New Zealand has shown the company and how profitable they are globally,” Robertson said. New Zealand Aluminium Smelters consumes about 5,000 gigawatt hours of electricity a year, roughly 12% of the country’s power. The smelter employs around 1,000 people directly and creates another 1,600 indirect jobs in the Southland region. Rio has been threatening to shutter the smelter for years as it demanded further subsidies from the government. The company acknowledged the decision “will have a significant impact on employees, the community and our customers,” but did not elaborate. “Extensive discussions with a wide range of interested parties have failed to secure a power contract that will enable the operation to become both competitive and profitable,” Rio Tinto said. The smelter is a joint venture, with Rio holding a 79.4% stake and Japan’s Sumitomo Chemical Co holding 20.6%. Rio had an underlying loss from it of NZ$46 million ($30.25 million) in 2019. The closure would mean surplus power supply in New Zealand’s South Island, which would hurt the power companies but have a positive impact on electricity prices. Shares of Meridian Energy Ltd, a major supplier of power to the smelter, plunged as much as 18.3% on the Kiwi bourse. Shares of all other energy firms also tumbled. Local power firms slammed Rio Tinto’s decision.. Contact Energy CEO Mike Fuge said all commercial parties had collectively delivered significant cost reductions for electricity to the smelter. “We’re very disappointed to have played our part in delivering these savings for one of the greenest smelters in the world and to have such limited engagement from Rio Tinto,” Fuge said in a statement."
8.117306175554686," China's Nanjing Iron & Steel seals blockchain iron ore deal with Rio Tinto JV BEIJING, July 8 (Reuters) - China’s Nanjing Iron & Steel Co Ltd said on Wednesday it has completed its first blockchain-backed trade in iron ore after booking a $16.87 million shipment of the steelmaking ingredient from a joint venture of miner Rio Tinto. Blockchain, a digital ledger that forms the backbone of many cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, helps to boost efficiency and transparency. For the past several years, commodities groups have been seeking to save time and money by using blockchain to digitalise a sector that still relies heavily on paperwork, but have come up against obstacles. Nanjing Iron spokesperson said the steel mill has acquired 170,000 tonnes - the equivalent of one Capesize bulk carrier - of Pilbara iron ore fines and lump from Hope Downs, a joint venture between Australian miners Rio Tinto and Hancock Prospecting Pty Ltd. The dollar-denominated transaction, supported by Singapore-based bank DBS and trade finance platform Contour, underscores the inroads being made by blockchain in the commodities sector in China, the world’s biggest iron ore consumer. “We are seeing more and more interest from mills and miners,” said Carl Wegner, CEO of Contour, adding that the process of issuing customers with digital letters of credit (LoCs) via blockchain technology was 90% faster than obtaining paper LoCs. Simon Farry, vice president of sales and marketing for Rio Tinto’s iron ore business, said recent paperless deals were part of the miner’s long-term strategy to push the adoption of blockchain in China and “bring the industry closer to a full cross-border digital trade future”. Nanjing Iron & Steel, which is located in eastern China’s Jiangsu province, is also in talks with other overseas miners about further blockchain deals, the spokesman added. Top steelmaker Baowu, the parent group of Baoshan Iron & Steel, also confirmed two similar trades with Rio Tinto and the world’s top listed miner BHP Group in the second quarter.

10.103154605414698," Rio Tinto cuts reserves at Mongolian copper project as costs rise MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Rio Tinto on Friday cut estimated reserves at its underground copper mine extension in Mongolia and confirmed it would face delays and higher costs after ground instability forced it to redesign its mine plan. Oyu Tolgoi (OT) is Rio’s biggest copper growth project but has faced geological challenges. In July last year, Rio estimated the project’s capital cost at $6.5 billion to $7.2 billion, as much as $1.9 billion more than its initial estimate in 2016. Rio said the updated feasibility study confirmed that recent cost estimate, and warned there could be further changes to reserves as it continues work on the design. Rio also narrowed its estimated first production from its mine to between October 2022 and June 2023, 21-29 months later than its initial estimate. Analysts at Citi estimated the changes in the mine plan reduce total production and copper tonnes by 11%.”OT gets a lot of investor air time for RIO but the reality is it is small in valuation terms,” Citi said, estimating a 3%contribution to Rio’s total valuation. Citi targets RIO at around A$96. Shares of Rio were down 1.5% at A$96.44, underperforming the broader market which was steady. In a statement, Rio said the new design for the underground mine confirmed its caving method remains valid, and “will unlock the most valuable part of Oyu Tolgoi”. The Oyu Tolgoi deposit in south Mongolia is one of the world’s largest known copper and gold deposits, with the open pit at the project contributing about 9% of Rio’s total mined copper in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. It is jointly owned by the Mongolian government and Rio’s majority-owned Turquoise Hill Resources. Last month, the miner entered an agreement for Mongolia to build a coal-fired plant to supply power to the Oyu Tolgoi mine."

The Mongolian state owns 34% in the Oyu Tolgoi project, while Rio’s majority-owned Turquoise Hill Resources has a 66% stake. The mining giant said in a statement it will amend its current power supply agreement with the Mongolian government by March 2021, under which the government will begin construction of a coal-fired power plant at Tavan Tolgoi by July 2021. The notice confirms that Rio will not have to build its own 300 MW coal power plant, which it had earlier estimated could cost $924 million. The Rio statement doesn’t disclose details of its power purchase arrangement with the government. “It just clarifies the funding, but you’re left with more questions,” said analyst Glyn Lawcock of UBS, referring to terms of the power deal. The plant is expected to come on stream within the next four years. Until then, power supply to the mine and the underground project, which is sourced from China, will continue under the current terms, it said. Rio Tinto announced a cost overrun at the project of up to $1.9 billion a year ago due to difficult geology, saying total capital expenditure was expected to be in a range of $6.5 billion-$7.2 billion, and it expected a delay of up to 30 months at the Oyu Tolgoi underground extension. The costs of building a power plant were expected to come on top of this figure. In March Rio flagged slowing operations at the Mongolian mine due to coronavirus restrictions.

19.96305625197581," Rio Tinto launches board-led review into sacred caves blast MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Rio Tinto on Friday launched a board-led review into how the miner destroyed two ancient and sacred Aboriginal caves in Western Australia, stepping up its response to the blasts after weeks of public criticism and shareholder dismay. In his first comments since the caves were destroyed in late May, Rio Tinto Chairman Simon Thompson apologised to present day traditional owners of the land and pledged to make public the review’s findings, due in October. With state government approval, the world’s biggest iron ore miner destroyed two caves at Juukan Gorge, one of which had contained evidence of continual human habitation stretching back 46,000 years, as part of a mine expansion. Rio’s initial response came from its head of iron ore, Chris Salisbury, who characterised the incident as the result of a communication error and apologised for the distress that it had caused land owners, but not for the caves’ destruction. “The decision to conduct a board-led review of events at Juukan Gorge reflects our determination to learn lessons from what happened and to make any necessary improvements to our heritage processes and governance,” Thompson said on Friday. The review will be conducted by Michael L’Estrange, an independent non-executive director of Rio Tinto, and will seek input from employees and the local Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people (PKKP). Investors said Rio Tinto appeared to have initially underestimated the gravity of the destruction of the caves, which archaeologists said were of immense value due an unbroken link in human habitation since before the last ice age. “I would say (their response) has been very poor,” said a Melbourne-based investor in the company, who declined to be named as the matter was sensitive. Investors noted Chief Executive Jean-Sébastien Jacques waited more than a fortnight to directly address the matter, while then BHP Chief Executive Andrew Mackenzie fronted investors within hours of the Samarco dam disaster in Brazil. “We were disappointed that the company presented the incident as a misunderstanding rather than a grave error of judgement,” said a top-20 investor in the company’s London listing, who declined to be named because the issue is sensitive. “We believe this will have serious ramifications for Rio’s future community support for its mining activities.” The new review will focus on events at Juukan Gorge to assess Rio Tinto’s internal heritage standards, procedures, reporting and governance, as well as examining the company’s relationship and communications with the PKKP. Rio said the review would complement and inform the company’s cooperation with an Australian federal parliamentary inquiry into the destruction of the caves, which is due to report by Sept. 30. Western Australia state is also reviewing its Aboriginal Heritage Act, which allows companies to destroy sacred sites “where land users conclude that impact to a site is unavoidable,” and doesn’t allow traditional owners right of appeal. Activist investor, the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, said investors were also interested in broader executive accountability at Rio Tinto, after a restructure in 2014 in which line responsibility for communities was moved from operations in Perth to corporate affairs in London. “I think investors have zoned in on that as a problem,” said the centre’s executive director Brynn O’Brien"

The novel coronavirus has hit commodity prices and threatens to push global economy into a deep recession. In response, major mining companies have cut costs and delayed projects but the industry boasts strong balance sheets owing to years of slashing debt and investing cautiously. Speaking at a virtual presentation at Bank of America, BHP CEO Mike Henry said the capital allocation framework, which was introduced in 2016 and assesses the best way to deploy spending across the group, had “been a game-changer” for the company. “It’s helped us to drive high quality returns and growth, so it’s not going anywhere,” he said. BHP, the world’s largest listed miner, said in April that spending in the 2021 financial year would be lower than its original guidance of $8 billion due to the coronavirus outbreak. Henry also said BHP could act on the right M&A opportunity but focus is on organic growth. He said the company is on track to cut spending on overheads by more than $500 million by 2021, relative to last financial year. At the same conference, the chief executive of rival Rio Tinto, Jean-Sébastien Jacques said he saw more potential acquisition opportunities in the current environment. “We do also see the potential for new opportunities to emerge,” Jacques said in a speech at the conference, but cautioned that the pandemic would harm GDP growth and trade, which are key drivers for mining. “We are keeping a watching brief on M&A. Right now, the market is finding it difficult to value companies and the COVID-19 recovery pathway is not clear,” he said. Prices for iron ore, which is mined by both Rio and BHP, have been relatively resilient and helped boost profits in both firms due to robust demand from top consumer China. [IRONORE/]"
41.92497710920941," BHP completes first yuan-based iron ore sale to China's Baosteel BEIJING (Reuters) - The world’s top listed miner BHP Group said on Tuesday it had made its first yuan-denominated sale of iron ore to China Baoshan Iron & Steel Co Ltd (Baosteel) and would explore using blockchain for such transactions in future. The sale of a Cape Size vessel of lump and fines, worth nearly 100 million yuan ($14.1 million), shows the Chinese currency is making further inroads in iron ore trading after Baosteel, the listed arm of the world’s biggest steelmaker China Baowu Steel Group, bought iron ore from Brazil’s Vale SA in yuan in January. BHP said the deal was a part of a 12-month trial and will involve multiple cargoes. The miner is also expecting to be able to complete its first blockchain iron ore transaction with Baosteel soon, it said in a statement. China, the largest iron ore consumer, brought in over 1 billion tonnes of the steelmaking raw material last year and has long sought to gain influence over pricing to help its steel firms weather market fluctuations. In a separate statement, Baowu noted it had now struck yuan-based deals with the “three giants” of iron ore - BHP, Rio Tinto and Vale. The fourth-biggest iron ore miner, Australia’s Fortescue Metals Group, is also selling in yuan after setting up a trading entity in China in April 2019. “The active promotion of renminbi settlement in iron ore transactions is not only for operational needs, but also in line with the trend of yuan internationalisation,” Baowu said. Baosteel recently concluded its first yuan-based iron ore purchase with Rio Tinto supported by Standard Chartered, blockchain financial platform Contour and other parties, according to a Rio Tinto statement sent to Reuters. China’s iron ore imports jumped more than 11% in April from a month earlier as steel mills raced to restore production after the coronavirus pandemic paralyzed the economy earlier in the year."

36.35016554770362," Rio Tinto dodges climate reporting fire, but issue unlikely to go away MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Rio Tinto shareholders in Australia voted on Thursday against forcing the miner to set targets for the emissions of its steel-making customers, but the issue is unlikely to go away as more than a third supported the motion. Investors have been pushing for corporate giants to cut back their emissions as part of a wider drive to combat global warming outlined in the Paris climate accord. Rio Tinto, which makes around 85% of its profits from sales of iron ore, has come under increasing pressure given its huge exposure to the steel industry, one of the world’s heaviest polluters. About 63% of shareholders in Australia voted against the resolution calling on Rio Tinto to set targets for its customers, called scope three emissions, while the other 37% voted in favour. The resolution was proposed by Friends of the Earth unit Market Forces and other investors. “It is extremely problematic for the mining industry to set targets for the steel industry,” Rio Chairman Simon Thompson said. “What Market Forces is asking us to do is set measures for a process we do not control and where we cannot even measure the starting point, nevermind any improvement.” A similar climate change-related resolution failed at BHP Group, the world’s largest listed miner. Rio late last year set targets to reach zero emissions by 2050, to cut emissions intensity by 30% and absolute emissions by 15% by 2030. BHP and Brazilian miner Vale have also pledged to set scope three goals. One way for Rio to cut emissions would be to close its Australian aluminium operations that are fuelled by coal-fired power after it put the loss-making business under review last year. Rio Tinto is still in discussions with state and federal governments as well as power utilities to find a “commercial solution”. “If we were at this stage to take more rapid unilateral action to reduce emissions, it would require the closure of some of our operations,” Thompson said. Rio promotes itself as the only major miner that does not produce carbon since it sold off its coal assets, but it also drew criticism over plans to build a $1 billion coal-fired power plant in Mongolia, to support its copper mine. The new power plant, which it is required to build under its investment agreement with the Mongolian government, would be more efficient than buying coal-fuelled power from Chinese plants as it does now, Thompson said. Thompson also refuted calls for Rio Tinto to quit the Minerals Council of Australia (MCA), despite acknowledging that MCA has sometimes advocated actions that have not always aligned with its climate policies. Like BHP, Rio argues that change is easier from within. Thompson noted that MCA has since changed its processes, and has done good work promoting safety and coordinating the industry’s coronavirus response."

Investors have been pushing for corporate giants to cut back their emissions as part of a wider drive to keep temperatures below a 2 degree maximum rise as outlined in the Paris climate accord. Rio Tinto, which makes around 85% of its profits from sales of iron ore, has come under increasing pressure given its huge exposure to the steel industry, one of the world’s heaviest polluters.

8.61266980912495," Rio Tinto's best earnings since 2011 clouded by virus risks MELBOURNE/BENGALURU (Reuters) - Rio Tinto RIO.AXRIO.L warned on Wednesday that the coronavirus outbreak may create challenging conditions over the next six months, with more disruptions to global supply chains and potential delays to projects in Australia. The miner’s warning comes on the heels of its best underlying earnings since 2011, buttressed by a sizable jump in iron ore prices last year. However, 2020 looks uncertain with economic activity stalling in many parts of China as it grapples to contain the virus that has killed more than 2,700 people and spread to over two dozen other countries. “Today, our iron ore books are full. But we are likely to see some short-term impact such as on supply chains and possibly in provisional services from Chinese suppliers,” Chief Executive Jean-Sébastien Jacques told reporters in a teleconference. Jacques said Rio was assessing the potential for delays to its projects from any disruptions at Chinese equipment suppliers and would inform the market of any change “in coming weeks.” “There could be (an impact) on all projects across the industry because lots of fabrication now is coming from China.” Rio Tinto, which took the title of the world's biggest iron ore miner from Vale VALE3.SA in 2019, is building its $2.6 billion Koodaideri iron ore mine, and was also planning to start construction in the first half of 2020 for mining new deposits at Tom Price. The coronavirus outbreak, while detrimental to short-term demand, may see Beijing unleash further measures to boost spending on steel-intensive sectors such as construction and infrastructure. “The Chinese government has many possible stimulus measures at its disposal. And we expect them to act,” Jacques added. Last week, the world's biggest miner, BHP Group BHP.AXBHPB.L flagged a hit to demand if the fallout extended beyond March. Rio Tinto is the last of the Australian iron ore giants to report in what has been a solid earnings season, and like the others it posted a lighter dividend than investors were expecting. Underlying earnings for the full year ended Dec. 31 climbed 18% to $10.37 billion. It was slightly under a consensus estimate of $10.40 billion by 17 analysts compiled by research firm Vuma Financial. “It’s an improved result on 2018, driven almost entirely by the higher iron ore price,” said investment analyst Brenton Saunders of fund manager Pendal Group in Sydney. “If anything the dividend is a bit light relative to free cash flow, which I suspect is partly related to...the coronavirus. Then they’d want to have a little bit more of a buffer.” The Anglo-Australian miner declared a final dividend of $2.31 per share, higher than $1.8 per share in 2018, but lower than consensus of $2.40, and it did not announce a special final dividend. Shares in London fell by 1.1 percent. Underlying earnings from iron ore, which accounts for about 85% of Rio’s underlying earnings, surged 48% to $9.64 billion in the year. Prices in Shanghai SH-CCN-IRNOR62 closed up by a quarter last year after supply disruptions in Brazil. So far this year, benchmark iron ore futures on China's Dalian Commodity Exchange DCIOcv1 have dipped 1.4%, plunging in late January on worries over a slump in demand due to the outbreak but then recovering in recent weeks on expectations for more stimulus. Jacques also said that Rio’s Australian aluminium business was on “thinner ice” than in August when it said it was in discussions with energy providers and the Australian government to ensure the “long term viability” of the assets. The story is similar for its hydro-powered New Zealand smelter, despite its green credentials, where discussions with its energy provider continue, Jacques said. Its fate is set to be revealed in the next month. On copper, Rio said investors could expect first production from what is shaping up to be a globally significant copper find at its Winu project in Western Australia as soon as 2023. Rio also pledged $1 billion on climate related spending over the next five years as it updated its climate strategy, and said that it would release an updated review of industry lobby groups and their position on climate change in the next week."

-0.45941646847688794," BP slammed for lofty climate change ambition, Rio ignored for small step: Russell SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Two major resource companies made two very different announcements recently, both on the theme of addressing climate change. The stark contrast between them shows the industry is still grappling with how to meet the challenges ahead. BP Plc’s new Chief Executive Bernard Looney set out an ambitious plan for the oil and gas giant to achieve a zero net emissions goal by 2050, saying the company needed to “reinvent” itself. In a far less splashy announcement, Rio Tinto, the world’s second-largest mining company, said it was committing A$98 million ($65 million) to building a solar farm and battery storage system at a remote iron ore mine in Western Australia. The BP announcement garnered vast media attention, as perhaps was appropriate given the sheer ambition of the target and the status of the company involved. The Rio statement received some relatively minor coverage in the Australian press and the specialist renewable energy media, but little beyond that. In essence, what happened is that BP made an announcement long on promise but short on detail, while Rio’s statement was big on detail, but limited in ambition. The BP announcement could be easily attacked by critics as just another attempt at “greenwashing” by a big company whose products are carbon emissions intensive. Certainly, BP copped flak for the lengthy time frame and the lack of a clear plan, and not just from environmental activists. Glencore Chief Executive Ivan Glasenberg was scathing of BP’s announcement, saying that 2050 was a “long way to go, and we don’t want to come out with wishy-washy ideas.” In some ways it may seem a bit rich for Glasenberg to be throwing stones from his glass house of being the company that exports the most thermal coal in the world, but he does have a point. What activists, and increasingly shareholders and financiers want to see is concrete plans and targets, and details of how resource companies intend to get there. Glencore said it will cut emissions by 30% within 15 years, including the Scope 3 emissions released by the consumers of its products. Emissions are divided by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol into Scope 1, which are emissions released during direct operations, Scope 2 are those from indirect sources, such as the electricity bought to make a product, and Scope 3 are those emitted by end users of the product. Up until recently most mining and oil companies were more focused on Scope 1 emissions, believing that those were mostly within their control, but there is a growing realization that accounting for Scope 2 and 3 is increasingly a focus of investors, governments and activists. BP has said it will provide a more detailed breakdown of how it will achieve its net zero emissions by September, and perhaps the company should be given the benefit of the doubt until this is released. But the less than positive reaction to BP’s announcement underscored the risks to companies that operate in emissions intensive industries. While BP may well be planning to “walk the talk”, for now it remains an example of the public relations effort seemingly getting ahead of the actual actions. In contrast, Rio may be somewhat disappointed it didn’t receive more kudos for its solar plans, which is the company’s first such facility. Rio said the plant will supply about 65% of the electricity to the Koodaideri mine, cutting annual carbon emissions equivalent to 28,000 cars. As resource companies increasingly move toward reducing their carbon footprint, it’s becoming clearer that they would benefit from a benchmarking process, which would have to be independent, authoritative and able to command the respect of the wider community.

1.4340430246531422," Rio Tinto seeks international arbitration on tax dispute with Mongolia (Reuters) - Global Miner Rio Tinto said on Friday its Mongolian copper unit had begun an international arbitration process, seeking to resolve a dispute with the local tax authority. Rio Tinto is already stuck in renegotiations over terms of the agreement underpinning the Oyu Tolgoi copper mine project, as local lawmakers contend that financial gains from the project are not being evenly shared with Mongolia. The project is Mongolia’s biggest foreign investment and has been subject to lengthy delays and ballooning costs, leaving the country’s lawmakers impatient for income. Meanwhile, Rio Tinto says it has invested billions. The present dispute relates to taxes paid by Oyu Tolgoi LLC, Rio’s unit, between 2013 and 2015. “We have worked diligently with the government and tax office representatives in Mongolia to find a mutually acceptable settlement and came to the conclusion that arbitration is the best way forward to resolve this issue,” Rio said in a statement. The miner said Oyu Tolgoi received a tax assessment for about $155 million on January 16, 2018 from the local tax authority, relating to an audit on taxes already imposed and paid by the unit between 2013 and 2015. Rio claims Oyu Tolgoi paid an amount of $4.8 million in January 2018 to settle the unpaid taxes, fines and penalties for items it accepted. Turquoise Hill Resources, majority owned by the mining giant, has a 66% stake in the multi-billion-dollar project and the Mongolian state owns 34%. “Turquoise Hill remains of the opinion that Oyu Tolgoi has paid all taxes and charges required to be paid under the investment agreement... and Mongolian law,” the company said in a separate statement."

The company said it is resuming operations following the passing of the cyclone and that it will take time for operations to return to normal. The Anglo-Australian miner now expects Pilbara shipments in 2020 between 324 million tonnes and 334 million tonnes, lower than its previous outlook of 330 million tonnes to 343 million tonnes. “The cyclone caused infrastructure damage across our entire Pilbara network, including impact to access roads, electrical and communications infrastructure and accommodation,” the company said. The powerful cyclone crossed the coast near Dampier in Western Australia state last week, with gusty winds of up to 200 km per hour (125 miles per hour). Rio last month reported a 3% drop in iron ore shipments for 2019. The company’s London-listed shares were about a percent higher at 1200 GMT.

The virus outbreak that began in China and prompted a lockdown that has weighed on the Chinese economy has sparked concerns about metals demand in the world’s top copper consumer. Transport restrictions have been imposed to stop the spread of the virus. Mongolia said on Monday it would suspend deliveries of coal across its border into China until March 2 and had already stopped foreign nationals entering via China. Yunnan Copper 000878.SZ, part of state-owned Chinese metals group Chinalco, takes almost 10,000 tonnes a month of copper concentrate, or partially processed copper ore, from Oyu Tolgoi for its Chifeng smelter in China's Inner Mongolia region, a source at the company said. Like other Chinese smelters, Yunnan Copper is struggling with high inventories of byproduct sulphuric acid amid the virus lockdown and has cut copper output at the 400,000 tonnes per year Chifeng plant by 30%, said the source, who declined to be named as he is not authorised to speak to media. The source said Yunnan Copper was currently unable to take concentrate from the Mongolian border to the plant via truck but the situation is “getting better”.

-11.408150118642514," Brazil's Vale loses spot as world's top iron ore producer to Rio Tinto RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil’s Vale SA on Tuesday posted a sharp output decline and $671 million in net additional provisions stemming from a deadly dam burst about a year ago, underlining the enduring effects of the incident on the iron ore giant. In a statement, the company reported a 22.4% fall in fourth-quarter iron ore production from the same period last year and a 9.6% drop in quarterly terms. With that, Vale officially lost its position in 2019 as the world’s top iron ore producer to Rio Tinto. In late January 2019, a Vale-owned tailings dam in the town of Brumadinho burst, killing some 270 people. The incident led to serious production stoppages, pledges by Vale to reconstruct or decommission many of its other dams and the firing of a number of executives. In a filing, Vale said it was decreasing the provisions previously allotted to “decharacterizing,” or modifying some smaller internal dikes, at nine dams similar to the one that burst last year by $447 million. However, the company said it will be decharacterizing some smaller internal dikes at some dams, which will lead to an additional $315 million in provisions. Additionally, the company said, regulations released in August require the decharacterization of some “drained stack structures,” which are a different kind of commonly used tailings dam. That process will require an additional $716 million in provisions, it said. Including other smaller adjustments, the total negative effect of the new provisions will be $671 million, which will be formally recognized when full-year financial results are released on Feb. 20, the company said. In addition to a drop in iron ore output, Vale reported a fall in fourth-quarter production in annual terms for all other products, with pellet and coal production falling some 40.5% and 39.6%, respectively. The company left its 2020 iron ore production guidance unchanged, but revised its pellet production forecast down to 44 million tonnes from 49 million, partly as a result of the suspension of the Laranjeiras dam over stability concerns. Credit Suisse said in a note that the additional provisions and production figures were disappointing, but also said Vale iron ore sales exceeded expectations, thanks to inventory drawdowns. Industry analysts were also pleased that Vale kept its 2020 iron ore production guidance steady at 340 million to 355 million tonnes. Brazil-listed common shares in Vale were up 3.7% in afternoon trade, as China iron ore futures registered their biggest one-day gain in seven months. Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa equities index was up 2.5%."
-17.57244410878034," Rio Tinto's full-year iron ore shipments drop on disruptions from cyclone and fire (Reuters) - Rio Tinto RIO.AX on Friday posted a 3% drop in iron ore shipments in 2019 as the Anglo-Australian miner's operations faced disruptions due to cyclone and a fire at a port facility. Iron ore shipped from Australia’s Pilbara region in 2019 was 327.4 million tonnes, the company said, well within its forecast of 320 million tonnes to 330 million tonnes. The company said it made up for the disruptions in the first half by way of higher iron ore production and shipments than a year earlier. However, in the fourth-quarter, shipments of the steel-making material dipped 1% to 86.8 million tonnes. The global miner has benefited from a jump in iron ore prices following a supply squeeze due to a fatal dam collapse in Brazil early last year. But with global production now stabilizing, the prices are off their highs. The company expects iron ore shipments, which accounts for more than 60% of its profit, to be between 330 million tonnes and 343 million tonnes in 2020. Rio Tinto has been shipping out higher volumes of a lower grade, 60 percent SP 10 product, as it struggles with operational bottlenecks at its new Koodaideri mine in Western Australia, from where it expects to produce ore in late 2021. The London-based miner posted a 28% jump in bauxite production in 2019 and said it expected aluminum production to be between 3.1 million tonnes and 3.3 million tonnes in 2020. It also set 2020 target of 530,000 to 580,000 tonnes of mined copper."

Rio said regular production by RBM, which produces ilmenite ore for titanium from mineral sand deposits, will be reached in early 2020, and that it was contacting customers who were earlier told about disruptions to their supply. “A phased restart is now in progress across the operation,” Rio Tinto said in a statement. There have been a number of violent incidents at mines across South Africa, including robberies, that have raised questions about the lack of security and the threats they pose to the industry.

-34.71344838082472," Water around Rio Tinto's Madagascar mine is high in lead, uranium: study JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Water downstream of a Rio Tinto mine in southern Madagascar contains high concentrations of uranium and lead, potentially endangering local residents who depend on a nearby lake and river for drinking water, a study released on Friday found. Lead, when ingested, can impede the mental and physical development of children, while uranium can cause kidney damage. The study commissioned by southern Madagascar-focused British environmental charity The Andrew Lees Trust found that concentrations of uranium were 350 times higher downstream of the QIT-Madagascar Minerals (QMM) mine than upstream of it, and that lead concentrations were 9.8 times higher. QMM extracts ilmenite - an industrial whitener - from mineral sands near the town of Taolagnaro. QMM is 80% owned by Rio Tintoand 20% owned by the Madagascar government. For the study, groundwater and mining specialist Dr Steven Emerman combined water samples previously provided by Rio Tinto with nine new water samples - five upstream of the mine and four downstream. The mean concentration of lead downstream of the mine was 0.0256 milligrams per liter, the study found, compared to 0.0026 mg/L upstream and a World Health Organisation (WHO) recommended maximum of 0.01 mg/L in drinking water. The mean concentration of uranium in the downstream water samples was 0.049 mg/L - 63% higher than the WHO guideline of 0.03 mg/L and compared with 0.00014 mg/L upstream. Rio Tinto argues radionuclides like uranium and thorium are already present at high concentrations in the mineral sands. “Rio Tinto does not believe that the mining process used at QMM directly introduces any enriched radiological material to the environment,” a spokesman for Rio Tinto said in emailed answers to Reuters’ questions. “The minerals in question are recognized as being present at relatively elevated levels in the natural environment with or without QMM operations.” Emerman said in his report he was “99% confident” the mine affects water quality. Emerman and Stella Swanson, a radioactivity expert hired by the Andrew Lees Trust, say the ilmenite extraction process can concentrate radionuclides. “The QMM mine definitely releases more uranium into water on the site, thus creating an enhanced source of uranium to the Mandromondromotra River and Lac Ambavarano,” Swanson said. The Andrew Lees Trust, which has been investigating the QMM mine since 2016 and “maintains a focus on the social and environmental challenges” it brings about, says QMM breached an environmental buffer zone separating the mine from nearby bodies of water. The Rio Tinto spokesman accepted a breach had taken place but did not reply to questions about whether there was a link between this and the uranium and lead in nearby water. He said the company had commissioned an independent technical consultancy to conduct a long-term study following the release of an initial report by Swanson in March this year. The Trust said no health study had been carried out to measure exposure to uranium, including through for example fish consumption and drinking water, in order to ascertain the exact level of risk."
-9.778421553471835," Apple buys first-ever carbon-free aluminum from Alcoa-Rio Tinto venture (Reuters) - Apple Inc on Thursday said it has bought the first-ever commercial batch of carbon-free aluminum from a joint venture between two of the world’s biggest aluminum suppliers. The metal is being made by Elysis, a Montreal-based joint venture of Alcoa Corp and Rio Tinto announced last year with $144 million in funding from the two companies, Apple and the governments of Canada and Quebec. The aluminum will be shipped this month from an Alcoa research facility in Pittsburgh and used in Apple products, although the technology company did not say which ones. Aluminum is carbon-intensive to produce. The smelting process involves passing electrical current through a large block of carbon called an anode, which burns off during the process and releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The carbon-free move is a response to consumer, activist and investor demand that miners and manufacturers show they are working to lessen their impact on climate change. “For more than 130 years, aluminum - a material common to so many products consumers use daily - has been produced the same way. That’s about to change,” Lisa Jackson, Apple’s vice president of environment, policy and social initiatives, said in a statement. Apple uses aluminum housings for many of its electronics, including iPhones, Apple Watches and Mac computers. Apple last year introduced Mac models that use recycled aluminum. The Alcoa-Rio joint venture wants to commercialize a technology by 2024 that uses a ceramic anode to make aluminum and emits only oxygen, eliminating direct greenhouse gas emissions from the smelting process. Alcoa has already produced test metal with the process and joined with Rio Tinto to bring it up to commercial scale. Elysis plans to license the technology and says that existing smelting facilities can be retrofitted to use it. The first batch was made in Pittsburgh, but Elysis also plans to manufacture it at a $50 million CAD research facility being built in Saguenay, Quebec, and that is expected to come online in the second half of 2020. Apple and Elysis would not disclose the size or cost of the first purchase. They described it as a “commercial batch,” and Elysis said the process is expected to have lower operating costs than traditional aluminum smelting."
-10.695965021604001," U.S. copper frenzy grows as Rio Tinto plans $1.5 billion Utah mine expansion (Reuters) - Rio Tinto Plc said on Tuesday it would spend $1.5 billion to expand its Kennecott copper mine in Utah, part of a growing trend by miners to invest in strategic mineral projects across the United States. The move more than doubles the mining industry’s recent investment in U.S. copper projects, as Tesla Inc and other automakers demand more of the red metal for electric vehicle motors and other components. “We like copper. We like the U.S.,” Rio Chief Executive Jean-Sebastien Jacques said in an interview. “If we had not taken this decision, our position in the U.S. market would be shrinking.” Rio said the investment will extend the life of the more-than 100-year-old open-pit mine near Salt Lake City from 2026 through 2032, with the potential to keep it operational thereafter. The expansion project, which Rio said will generate “attractive returns” without elaborating, is set to get underway next year. Once seen as a laggard in the global mining industry, U.S. copper deposits have drawn more than $1.1 billion in recent investments from small and large miners alike before Rio’s Tuesday announcement. U.S. President Donald Trump has moved to cut mining regulations since taking office in a bid to encourage domestic mining and also offset China’s control of key parts of the military weapons supply chain, efforts that have dovetailed with those in the U.S. Congress. The Kennecott mine on privately-owned land produces nearly 20% of the U.S. copper production, as well as gold and silver. Rio operates one of three U.S. copper smelters at the site. The Anglo-Australian company had telegraphed last year here that it was on the hunt for fresh copper, though analysts had assumed a large acquisition rather than expansion of an existing asset, was likely. Rio has faced recent challenges in other parts of its copper portfolio. Its Mongolian copper mine project hit a major setback last month when lawmakers there approved plans to revise the terms of an agreement underpinning the multibillion-dollar development. In Arizona, Rio’s Resolution underground copper project with BHP Group has spent years waiting for U.S. approval, though the permit logjam appears to be clearing. Rio also said on Tuesday it was working with U.S. government scientists to extract rhenium and tellurium - used in jet engines and military explosives - from Kennecott’s refiners and smelters. Rivals Glencore Plc and Freeport-McMoRan Inc also have U.S. mining projects under development."
-14.041469202626637," Canada's First Quantum may team-up with Rio Tinto to develop Peru copper mine LONDON (Reuters) - Canadian miner First Quantum Minerals Ltd is looking for strategic partners to develop new copper projects and a joint venture with Rio Tinto in Peru could be on the cards, First Quantum’s chief executive officer said on Wednesday. “That is what we are going to explore and it just depends on what kind of partner we get,” First Quantum CEO Philip Pascall said on the sidelines of a conference in London, referring to the company’s plans to find strategic partners. “There are a number of different potential players, not necessarily mining companies,” he added. When asked if First Quantum could partner with Rio to develop a copper mine in Peru, Pascall said that would be one of the options. A Rio spokesman declined to comment. First Quantum owns the Haquira deposit in southern Peru and Rio owns the La Granja porphyry copper project in the South American country. Pascall said new copper mines generally require between $3 billion and $4 billion to develop as grades have declined in recent years necessitating higher mining volumes. First Quantum is heavily indebted, carrying a $7.6 billion net debt at the end of its third quarter, up 24% from a year ago, according to the company’s latest financial statements. It began commercial production in September at the Cobre Panama mine where Pascall said he was looking for a partner to replace Korea Resources Corp, which owns 10%.

1.5241722024391593," Rio Tinto faces having to renegotiate terms of Mongolian copper project ULAANBAATAR (Reuters) - Rio Tinto faces renegotiating the terms of an agreement underpinning its Mongolian copper mine project, after lawmakers on Thursday approved plans to revise the deal to make it more beneficial for Mongolia. The Oyu Tolgoi mine, Mongolia’s biggest foreign investment project, has already been subject to delays and ballooning costs, leaving Mongolian lawmakers impatient for income, while Rio Tinto says it has invested billions. Rio Tinto-owned Turquoise Hill Resources has a 66% stake in the multi-billion-dollar project and the Mongolian state owns 34%, with investment terms agreed in 2015 in a deal known as the Dubai Agreement. Rio Tinto said in an email that it understood that the Mongolian parliament’s vote on Thursday to revise the deal needed to be finalised and it would provide a further update once that happened. Thursday’s vote was the culmination of a two-year process after a working group was set up to establish the benefits of the Dubai Agreement and submitted its report to parliament. “For now, the Oyu Tolgoi agreement is not benefiting Mongolian citizens,” Battumur Baagaa, a member of the Mongolian parliamentary working group, said when he first presented the report in July. “It is good to attract foreign investment but that doesn’t mean foreign investment should only benefit the foreign side.” In July, Rio Tinto announced a cost overrun of up to $1.9 billion, saying total capital expenditure was expected to be in a range of $6.5 billion-$7.2 billion, and it expected a delay of up to 30 months at the Oyu Tolgoi underground extension. The recommendations approved by parliament include replacing the 34% interest with a special royalty and bringing forward the date - currently set at 2041 - when Mongolia begins receiving dividends. The working group argued the Dubai agreement was never ratified by parliament and was not legally binding. On Monday, Mongolia’s Administrative Court ruled that former prime minister Chimed Saikhanbileg had violated the law when he signed the Dubai Agreement. A non-governmental organization named Darkhan Mongol Nogoo Negdel had asked the court to check the legality of Saikhanbileg’s approval of the agreement. Turquoise Hill, which is 51%-owned by Rio Tinto, also said it would provide a further update once the parliamentary resolution was finalised. Rio’s difficulties in Mongolia have held back its share price, analysts say. Rio shares fell 1.2% on Thursday. They have gained around 11% this year, but Turquoise Hill shares have shed around 74% this year."

The world’s second-biggest listed miner, which has a 68.4% stake in ERA, also said it will fully underwrite ERA’s A$476 million ($326 million) equity fundraising, after the uranium miner failed to secure someone else willing to do so. Shares of ERA slumped 22.5% to A$0.190 on Friday, their lowest in almost five months, in a broader market that was up around a percent. ERA has been looking to raise money to fund the closure and rehabilitation of the Ranger project in Australia’s Northern Territory after it ran into controversy due to its proximity to the Kakadu National Park - the country’s largest. The Australian Government has documented more than 200 environmental incidents at the mine between 1979 and 2003. ERA said it has been working closely with Rio for a funding solution after flagging, earlier this year, a higher-than-expected rehabilitation provision for the Ranger project which it could not cover. “We take mine closure very seriously and ensuring ERA is able to fund the closure and rehabilitation of the Ranger Project Area, through participating in this entitlement offer, is a priority,” Rio’s group executive for energy and minerals, Bold Baatar, said in a statement. ERA has until January 2021 to end mining activities, and until January 2026 to complete rehabilitation of the area. The rehabilitation work will not lead to any returns for ERA. ERA was the target of some of the biggest environmental protests across Australia in 1998, including an eight-month blockade and 500 arrests, after the local indigenous Mirarr people opposed its planned development of the nearby Jabiluka concession on the fringe of the Kakadu rainforest."

2.730250256522757," Rio Tinto flags higher costs, cloudy Australian aluminum future MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Rio Tinto on Thursday flagged higher costs as it replaces aging infrastructure and boosts iron ore production, and also raised questions over the future of its Australian aluminum business. Rio, which could become the world’s top iron ore producer this year, was beset by weather and operational issues in the first quarter which caused it to cut its annual guidance. On Thursday it also signaled higher costs, as it boosts spending to refit and replace aging plants and old fleets as part of a briefing to investors. In a statement, Rio flagged higher sustaining capital expenditure of $1-$1.5 billion each year from 2020, versus earlier guidance of around $1 billion. It also said it had deferred $500 million of capital expenditure in 2019 to the next year. The global miner said total capital expenditure in 2019 is expected to be around $5.5 billion, and $7 billion in 2020. It put guidance for 2021 and 2022 at $6.5 billion. “We are approaching a phase where ... we have a generation of assets that needs renewing,” head of iron ore Chris Salisbury told an investor briefing. “I wouldn’t say (the spending increase) is permanent. It’s cyclical. We will continue to update that guidance as we go forward,” he said. Assets include a concentrator at its Tom Price iron ore mine in Western Australia and replacing some of its existing truck fleet, he said. The world’s second largest iron ore miner is building out its new Koodaideri mine in Western Australia which it expects to help it achieve a long-held goal of 360 million tonnes of iron ore a year. That rate was once expected to be reached by the end of this year, but a number of operational bottlenecks and other issues have meant the step change will need to wait until the new mine has ramped up in 2022, Salisbury said. Rio forecast a rise in iron ore shipments for 2020 of up to 5%, subject to market conditions. Rio has been shipping out increasing volumes of a lower grade, 60 percent SP 10 product. On its Australian aluminum assets, Rio said the current power situation was not sustainable as prices were too high, the same scenario that led it to review its New Zealand smelter. “The smelters do lag internationally competitive prices which undermines the viability of the asset,” head of aluminum Alf Barrios said on an earlier media call. Power accounts for a third of aluminum costs, he said. In Australia, where Rio has three aluminum smelters, it was talking to power providers and the government, he said. “I’m not going to speculate on the outcome but clearly the current situation is not sustainable.”"

3.5225757373825433," CORRECTED-Rio Tinto says miners need to leverage technology as scrutiny of the industry rises (Corrects OCT 28 story to delete reference to coal, paragraph 6) LONDON, Oct 28 (Reuters) - Mining companies should make more use of technology to respond to increasing demands from investors and communities for responsible mining practices, Rio Tinto CEO Jean-Sébastien Jacques said on Monday. Technologies such as autonomous rail-cars and increased automation can lower the impact of the industry on the environment as well as raise profit margins, he said, adding that blockchain can be deployed to track if the supply chain met ethical standards. “There is absolutely no doubt in my mind we will face greater regulation and scrutiny,” Jacques said in a keynote speech marking the beginning of London Metal Exchange (LME) Week in London. “Society expects more of our industry which in turn brings with it a sea-change in shareholder expectations and more and more questions on our business model.” Pressure from investors with an environmental, social and governance, or ESG, agenda has forced miners to focus on their climate and community credentials as part of efforts to repair an image tarnished by environmental disasters and overspending. Rio makes aluminium, a high emitter of carbon. The company is collaborating with Apple and Alcoa to slash its carbon footprint by developing ways to make carbon-free aluminium. “The only way we can truly tackle climate change is through partnerships across the value chain,” said Jacques. Rio has pledged substantial decarbonisation by 2050 while larger rival BHP said in July it would invest $400 million over five years to reduce emissions. Rio is also looking into generating battery-grade lithium carbonate from waste rock in California and testing new approaches at its Winu copper project in Australia, he said. He added that the approach to doing business in a more environmentally-friendly way needs to be “based on a pragmatic kind of sustainability. With profitability at its heart.” “Only a profitable business can provide sustainable benefits to shareholders, to communities, and governments.” In August, Rio announced its highest margins in a decade and a record dividend payout, part of an industry-wide recovery from the commodities crash of 2015-16. The LME, the world’s oldest and largest metals trading hub, has said it could ban metal tainted by child labour, money-laundering and corruption by 2023.

15.900372161937174," Rio Tinto considers curtailment, closure of New Zealand aluminum smelter (Reuters) - Global miner Rio Tinto Ltd on Wednesday flagged a possible pullback or closure of New Zealand’s Aluminum Smelter (NZAS), citing weakness in the aluminum market and high energy costs. The miner said it will conduct a strategic review of the South Island-based site, which will conclude in the first quarter of 2020. The site, about 20% owned by Japan’s Sumitomo Chemical Co Ltd, employs about 1,000 people. “We expect the short to medium outlook for the aluminum industry to be challenging and this asset to continue to be unprofitable,” the miner said in a statement. The move comes a week after Rio downplayed its annual aluminum production guidance and flagged challenging conditions in the industry. Rio’s production of the metal dropped 3% in the September quarter. “The aluminum industry is currently facing significant headwinds with historically low prices due to an over-supplied market. This means that many aluminum providers are reviewing their positions,” said Rio Tinto Aluminum chief executive Alf Barrios. Separately, New Zealand’s Meridian Energy Ltd, which supplies electricity to the site, noted Rio’s review and said its supply contract runs to 2030. “NZAS officials have advised us that the economics of the smelter have been challenged due to volatile international prices for aluminum, relatively high energy and transmission costs and an upcoming refurbishment bill to keep one of the potlines operational,” Meridian chief executive Neal Barclay said. Meridian and NZAS had entered their current contract in 2013, following a renegotiation that had seen the two agreeing to lower electricity prices. New Zealand’s only aluminum smelter currently uses about 5,011 gigawatt hours of electricity per year, equal to roughly 776,000 households, and produces 340,000 tonnes of high-grade aluminum annually."
15.900372161937174," Rio Tinto studying ways to produce lithium from waste rock at California mine (Reuters) - Rio Tinto Plc RIO.L is studying ways to extract lithium from waste rock at a mine it controls in California, making it the latest company trying to produce the battery metal in the United States for the fast-growing electric vehicle market. The move by Rio comes as U.S. politicians and regulators push to expand domestic mining of so-called strategic minerals used to make EV batteries and other high-tech equipment. China is the world’s largest producer and consumer of many of these minerals. Rio has produced borates - a group of minerals used to make soaps, cosmetics and other consumer goods - for nearly a century in the Mojave Desert, about 120 miles (195 km) north of Los Angeles. That has left behind decades’ worth of waste rock, known in the industry as tailings. Rio said it had been probing the tailings for gold and discovered lithium at a concentration higher than rival U.S. projects under development, although the company declined to give the exact percentage. “The material being used has already been mined, so this will be a low-energy option for the production of lithium,” Bold Baatar, Rio’s chief executive of energy and minerals, said in a statement to Reuters. The company is spending $10 million to build a pilot plant that will extract the white metal using a heat-and-leaching process involving a kiln heated to 1,740°F (949°C). The pilot plant will only produce about 10 tonnes annually. If that step is successful, Rio said it would consider spending $50 million to build an industrial-scale plant to make 5,000 tonnes of lithium annually. That would be roughly the same production capacity as a lithium brine project in Silver Peak, Nevada, controlled by, Albemarle Corp ALB.N - the world's largest lithium producer. Rio said its facility could eventually be the largest lithium producer in the United States, though it did not give any long-term output estimates. If brought into commercial production, the Rio facility would make battery-grade lithium, the type of the metal sought by Panasonic Corp 6752.T and other cathode producers, who in turn supply the battery part for use in Teslas TSLA.O and other electric vehicles. Rio also controls Utah’s Kennecott copper mine and a lithium deposit in Serbia that has yet to be developed. Other companies developing U.S. lithium projects include Lithium Americas Corp LAC.TO, Standard Lithium Ltd SLL.V, Texas Mineral Resources Corp TMRC.PK, Piedmont Lithium Ltd PLL.AX and ioneer Ltd INR.AX, which is developing a Nevada lithium project also containing a large concentration of borates."

15.694288785544291," Rio Tinto sees rosy future for diamonds despite end of Argyle LONDON (Reuters) - Rio Tinto RIO.AXRIO.L is exploring for diamonds in Canada as part of its plans to stay in the sector despite the looming closure of its Argyle mine in Australia, known for extremely rare pink diamonds, the firm's head of copper and diamonds said. Demand and prices for the wider market have fallen as concerns mount about the world economy, and laboratory-grown gems have added to supply. Colored or particularly large diamonds, however, have held value, especially pink diamonds, 90% of which are produced by Argyle. That mine, the world’s biggest in carat terms, is expected to cease production by the end of next year. Arnaud Soirat, Rio’s chief executive for copper and diamonds, said pink diamonds had risen in price by 500% since 2000. He gave no figures for the overall market, but producers have reported lower overall demand and prices. Despite the overall bearish backdrop, Soirat said Rio Tinto planned to stay in diamonds. “Diamonds is a business we like a lot. It’s a very high-margin business in line with our strategy of value over volume. It makes a lot of sense. We want to stay in the diamonds business,” Soirat said in an interview. Rio is exploring in Canada, where it has a 60% interest in and operates the Diavik Diamond Mine. It also has a joint venture with Canada's Star Diamond Corp DIAM.TO. Rio declines to give separate figures for diamonds but last year’s total exploration spend was $488 million. Its gross diamond sales in 2018 raised $695 million and delivered net earnings of $118 million, compared with group core profits, dominated by iron ore, of $18 billion. Soirat said each pink carat could be worth several million dollars. He is overseeing one of the last sealed bid tenders, which offers 64 Argyle pink diamonds and closes on Oct. 9, following showings to potential buyers in London, New York and Perth, Australia. Soirat said there could be two more tenders depending on Argyle’s production in its final months. The pink diamond tenders have been held annually since 1984. Diamond specialists say the pink color is thought to be created by a twist within the atomic lattice during formation more than a billion years ago. Other diamond miners, which have long excelled at marketing, are chasing margins. The world's biggest producer by volume, Alrosa ALRS.MM, which also has some pink stones, is marketing naturally occurring fluorescent diamonds. Rebecca Foerster, president of Alrosa in the United States, the world’s leading diamond market, said Argyle’s closure should boost the price of pink stones and help Alrosa achieve “a significant market share of colored diamonds”, adding that the impact on the overall diamond market would be limited."
10.36621844628584," Rio Tinto takes GFG Alliance to arbitration over outstanding smelter payments * Rio Tinto says payment for Dunkerque aluminium outstanding * GFG Alliance says “differences” were being “reconciled” * GFG says outstanding amount is much smaller than $50 mln MELBOURNE, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Rio Tinto Plc has triggered an arbitration process with billionaire industrialist Sanjeev Gupta’s GFG Alliance because the company did not make final payments for its purchase of the Dunkerque aluminium smelter in France, Rio said on Monday. Rio sold the smelter to GFG for $500 million last year in what was a stand out deal for the emerging industrial powerhouse as it ramped up an acquisition spree. But final payments for the sale to privately held GFG Alliance’s unit Liberty House are outstanding, Rio said in a statement. “Rio Tinto confirms it has triggered an arbitration process in relation to the sale of the Dunkerque aluminium smelter, France, to Liberty House,” it said. “The arbitration relates to non-payment of customary post-closure adjustments, including working capital, which was agreed by both parties in the sale and purchase agreement,” Rio said in the statement The Financial Times first reported the story on Monday saying that the outstanding payment was $50 million. However, GFG Group said in a statement to Reuters that outstanding payment amount was “significantly smaller,” and that the transaction had been “very successful” and relationships with its banks were constructive. “As is usual practice in sizeable mergers and acquisitions, there is a mechanism in place post-completion to settle the final consideration to be paid to the vendor net of working capital, accounting and other issues,” GFG said. “This system is ongoing with the vendor as part of the normal process, and differences are being reconciled...This smelter is operating on budget, it is highly profitable and cash generative despite poor aluminium prices.”"
10.926614641931923," Rio Tinto's Resolution copper project in Arizona moves step closer LONDON (Reuters) - Rio Tinto on Friday said it had moved a step closer to the development of a new copper project in Arizona, one of the few new major known deposits of the metal, with the potential to meet around a quarter of U.S. demand. Miners have been scouring the globe for sources of copper - a mineral they predict will be in high demand as the world shifts toward renewable power and electric vehicles. Resolution Copper, 55% owned by Rio Tinto and 45% by BHP, has spent years waiting for clearance from U.S. authorities to develop the underground mine. On Friday, Rio Tinto said a 90-day public consultation would begin now that the U.S. States Forest Service had released a draft environmental impact statement (DEIS) following a six-year review of the planned mine. The in-depth review lays out the environmental challenges, solutions to them and benefits of the mine and is part of the final regulatory phase the project needs to clear. Arnaud Soirat, Rio Tinto’s chief executive for copper and diamonds, said in a statement the publication of the DEIS was “a major permitting milestone” and the mine could meet up to 25% of U.S. copper demand. Estimates so far suggest it could produce 40 billion pounds of copper over a 40 year-period. U.S. Forest Service documents also say that minerals on the U.S. critical minerals list such as cobalt, manganese and vanadium could be present in “elevated concentrations” at Resolution. Rio Tinto and BHP will have spent more than $2 billion to develop and permit the project by 2020, which is the deadline for the Forest Service to produce a final environmental impact survey. Resolution can then come up with a finalised mine design, which could take several years, and begin construction. U.S. President Donald Trump has emphasized the need for the United States to develop its own resources as he stokes trade tensions with China. All commodity markets have come under pressure from the U.S. trade dispute with China but Soirat said long-term copper market fundamentals were strong. “Rio Tinto will be well positioned to benefit from this demand outlook and to provide North American manufacturers with the materials that are essential to their products,” he said. Mining projects notoriously take longer than expected and Rio Tinto’s share price has been hit by delays at its giant underground copper expansion project Oyu Tolgoi in Mongolia.

3.236158561539044," Rio Tinto addresses operational problems, delivers record payout LONDON (Reuters) - Rio Tinto announced its highest margins in a decade and a record dividend payout on Thursday, but acknowledged it was grappling with operational issues in Australia and Mongolia. Underlying earnings for the six months ended June 30 rose 11% year-on-year to $4.93 billion, just shy of a consensus estimate of $4.95 billion compiled by Vuma Financial. Rio’s shares were down 3.4% by 1330 GMT in London. They have risen by more than 20% this year. Analysts cited macro-economic tensions as a reason for caution, as growth slows in China, Rio’s biggest customer for iron ore. Fund managers, speaking on condition of anonymity, said operational problems and concerns over Rio Tinto’s giant Oyu Tolgoi copper expansion project in Mongolia also weighed on the share price. Iron ore accounts for more than 60% of Rio Tinto’s earnings. Iron ore supplies have been squeezed after a Vale dam burst in Brazil in January, killing at least 240 people and forcing the suspension of production. Cyclone disruption in Australia also cut output. Reduced supplies meant iron ore outperformed other base metals on commodity markets this year, generating high margins for miners even if their sales volumes have fallen. Rio said its Pilbara iron ore project in Australia had delivered a 72% EBITDA (Earnings before Interest Tax, Depreciation and Amortization) margin, compared with the group’s overall EBITDA margin of 47%, making for the highest margins in a decade. Strong earnings growth allowed the miner to increase its interim dividend by 19% to 151 cents per share. It also announced a special dividend of $1 billion, making for total interim returns to shareholders of a record $3.5 billion. Already this year, Rio had delivered $7.8 billion to shareholders and a total of $32 billion over the last three-and-a-half years, CEO Jean-Sebastien Jacques said. “What do investors want? Rio offers high yield and investors want yield,” Chris LaFemina, a managing director at Jefferies bank, said in a note. Rio can offset headwinds by increasing capital returns, but will not be immune if macro conditions deteriorate further, LaFemina said. He rates Rio a “buy”. Jacques said he believed trade tensions between the United States and China would be resolved. “I’m always the optimist. I feel at some point commonsense will prevail,” he told reporters. He said the company also faces issues it should be better able to control including cost overruns and delays at the copper project in Mongolia, as well as operational problems that have impacted production at the flagship Pilbara iron ore assets. Pressed on the extent and cost of delays at Oyu Tolgoi, Jacques said the company was using complex modeling and the full extent of what the company faced was not yet clear. “We hope by early next year we’ll have a better sense of what is the option to unlock the value of this world class resource,” he told reporters.

Turquoise Hill, which owns 66% of the mine, reported a loss of $736.7 million, or 22 cents a share, in the three months ended June 30, compared with a profit of $204 million, or 9 cents, a year earlier. That compared with analyst expectations for earnings of 3 cents a share. Oyu Tolgoi, operated by Rio Tinto PLC and expected to become one of the mining company’s most lucrative properties, produced 39,156 tonnes of copper and 71,825 ounces of gold during the quarter. That came at an all-in sustaining cost of $1.54 per pound of copper produced, compared with $2.42 a year earlier. Oyu Tolgoi’s underground expansion has been beset by delays, cost overruns and political squabbles, prompting the government of Mongolia, which owns 34% of the mine, to set a vote for August to cancel parts of an investment agreement with Rio Tinto. This would reduce the company’s future profits while benefiting Mongolia. Turquoise Hill shares have slumped 46% since it said this month it could spend as much as $1.9 billion more than the $5.3 billion previously announced on the underground expansion of Oyu Tolgoi, and that first production would be delayed by up to 30 months. The impairment causing its quarterly loss was related to that increase in expected spending and delays, the company said on Wednesday. Turquoise Hill, which is also listed on the New York Stock Exchange, said its share price decline to below $1 meant it is no longer in compliance with the exchange’s listing rules, and that it intends to “pursue measures to cure the share price non-compliance.” Turquoise Hill spent $292 million on the expansion during the quarter, bringing total expenditure on the underground project since January 1, 2016, to $2.9 billion. Turquoise Hill posted revenue of $382.7 million, down from $341.7 million a year ago and compared with analysts’ expectations of $307.5 million.

ERA said it had total cash resources of A$425 million ($296 million) at June 30, while the rehabilitation provision was A$799 million. Rio had indicated it was only willing to provide financial support through a renounceable entitlement offer by ERA, the uranium miner said in a statement. Rio would subscribe for its 68.4% entitlement of new shares, but had also offered to underwrite the balance of the offer in the event that the company is unable to get alternative underwriters. ERA said it was considering a potential renounceable entitlement offer, and was also looking at other funding sources.

The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) LAUNCESTON, Australia, July 22 (Reuters) - Looking for a long-term bullish signal for copper? Then look no further than Rio Tinto’s struggles with the Oyu Tolgoi mine and expansion project in Mongolia. The latest news about the giant copper-gold project is that the production from the underground expansion will be delayed by more than a year to between May 2022 and June 2023, and that costs have ballooned by another $1.9 billion. The capital cost of the project is now estimated at $6.5 billion to $7.2 billion, up from an original estimate of $5.3 billion. Rio Tinto, through its Turquoise Hill Resources subsidiary, owns 66% of the Oyu Tolgoi mine, which could become the world’s third-largest copper mine by production in 2025 under the current development plan. What’s becoming more of an issue for the mine is that the Mongolian government owns the other 34%, and it appears that there is mounting disquiet in Ulaanbaatar that the landlocked country between Russia and China is getting a dud deal. Mongolia’s parliament is set to approve measures that would terminate the 2015 agreement on the Oyu Tolgoi underground expansion, seeking to bring forward the time when it will receive dividend payments from the project, demand more transparency on copper prices and push for Rio Tinto to build a power plant. Currently, Mongolia will only start to receive dividends around 2041, when its share of the debt for the project is repaid. “For now, the Oyu Tolgoi agreement is not benefiting Mongolian citizens,” Battumur Baagaa, a member of the parliamentary working group scrutinising the project, told Reuters. “It is good to attract foreign investment but that doesn’t mean foreign investment should only benefit the foreign side.” The sentiment expressed in the above quote goes to the heart of Rio Tinto’s Mongolia problem, and indeed to any mining company considering a major investment in a developing, or frontier market. The Oyu Tolgoi project is a country-changer for Mongolia, with its capital budget making it the biggest ever undertaken in the country, but it’s also more than half of the annual gross domestic product (GDP) of $13 billion. By comparison, the $200 billion of spending on eight liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects in Australia over the past decade, the biggest investment in a single industry in the country’s history, represented about 17% of annual GDP. A country such as Mongolia cannot afford the upfront cost for its stake in a project the size of Oyu Tolgoi, so it pays for its share by deferring dividends. While this sounds like a good solution in theory, it also means that the government, and the populace, see the mine being built and start operations, but they don’t necessarily see the benefits flowing to them. Rio Tinto makes the point on its website that from 2010 to the third quarter of 2018 it has spent “$8.3 billion in-country in the form of salaries, payments to Mongolian suppliers, taxes, and other payments to the government.” The question is whether this is enough, and the answer the Mongolian authorities appear to be giving is no. The obvious risk for Rio Tinto is that it spends billions of dollars on an investment that takes a longer period to deliver returns, or even in the worst case the asset is seized by the state. This situation is increasingly being confronted by resource companies around the globe. Mozambique and Tanzania are both keen to see international oil and gas companies spend billions of dollars developing an LNG industry in the east African neighbours. But will the authorities remain satisfied with the terms that were initially struck when it becomes clear that the benefits to the government coffers will take some time to flow? Increasingly, valuable deposits of commodities are in jurisdictions with higher country risk, but it doesn’t appear that project developers factor in the likelihood of having to renegotiate terms once vast amounts have already been spent. It’s always going to be a fine balance between a company assessing how much of the value of the project it can afford to surrender to the host country, and the government of that country working out how hard they can squeeze before the company walks away and your investment reputation is severely damaged. For the market, the risk is that much of the new supply of several key resources is likely to come from countries such as Mongolia, and the question is how likely is it that this resource is actually developed and delivers to plan.

-13.050651998992674," Rio Tinto under fire as Mongolia presses for mine deal changes ULAANBAATAR/LONDON (Reuters) - Mongolia will vote in August to rip up parts of an investment agreement with Rio Tinto for the Oyu Tolgoi copper mine, which may force the miner to make concessions in a project beset by delays and political squabbles. The country owns 34% of the mine, Mongolia’s biggest foreign investment project, but lawmakers claim delays and cost overruns have meant it has run up more debt from the project than income thus far. Ending the 2015 “Dubai agreement” that launched Oyu Tolgoi’s underground expansion would likely reduce Rio’s future profits in Mongolia’s favor. Mongolia’s parliament is set to approve binding recommendations that would end the agreement and demand more transparency from Rio on copper prices for exports from the mine, legislators said this week. The recommendations also insist Rio should bring forward the date when Mongolia starts receiving dividends from Oyu Tolgoi, currently set at 2041 when the country’s debt from the project is repaid. It will also press Rio Tinto to build a power plant and provide more clarity on costs and earnings. If the recommendations are approved, the government will be obliged to carry them out and ask Rio Tinto to renegotiate the Oyu Tolgoi agreements. “For now, the Oyu Tolgoi agreement is not benefiting Mongolian citizens,” said Battumur Baagaa, member of the parliamentary working group scrutinizing the project. “It is good to attract foreign investment but that doesn’t mean foreign investment should only benefit the foreign side.” The working group argued the Dubai agreement was never ratified by parliament and is not legally binding. Narantsogt Sanjaa, a Mongolian finance ministry official, told parliament that the project had paid $1.5 billion in taxes and royalties but accumulated debts of $1.6 billion, in an economy of only $13 billion. Mongolia pays off its 34% share of total costs by deferring its dividends. The recommendations follow Rio announcing this week it had discovered “stability risks” in Oyu Tolgoi’s design, and full production was now expected to begin between May 2022 and June 2023, over a year behind schedule, with costs to soar by up to $1.9 billion. Total costs have spiraled from $4.4 billion in the initial feasibility study to more than $11 billion by last year, legislators said, and that does not include the proposed power plant. “INCREASE THE BENEFITS” Rio Tinto has rejected earlier renegotiation requests but said on Friday that it was prepared to look at ways to “increase the benefits” for Mongolia. Oyu Tolgoi was launched in 2009 after an investment agreement granted Mongolia its share and the rest to Canada’s Ivanhoe Mines, now the Rio Tinto-controlled Turquoise Hill Resources. Turquoise Hill’s shares have plummeted 38% since the delay announcement. “I am struggling to understand why Rio’s Board are not holding Jean-Sebastien Jacques accountable for this,” a Rio Tinto shareholder said, referring to Rio’s chief executive. “There has been zero accountability for this mess so far.” In a statement on Friday, a Rio Tinto spokesman said, “Revising the existing agreements would threaten the future of the project and we are already working with the Government through a joint working group to find ways to further increase the benefits to Mongolia.” “The working group is looking at the interest rate, power, regional development and tax,” the spokesman added, without elaborating. Analysts said expectations for Oyu Tolgoi were always too high, with the public wanting Soviet-era type profit-sharing and infrastructure. “It is very difficult because every politician wants the benefits now,” said Otgochuluu Chuluuntseren, a former government official at the Economic Policy and Competitiveness Research Center, a Mongolian think-tank. Both sides will want to ensure the project proceeds smoothly since it is crucial for their future revenue. Scrapping the project would be “economic suicide,” said Chris Melville, a lawyer who works with foreign investors in Ulaanbaatar. Mongolia does not want to put off foreign investors, especially after a slump in capital inflows in 2016 led to economic collapse, forcing it to seek aid from the International Monetary Fund. “We should follow international law even if we sign something stupid, and reasonable politicians are thinking the same. It is too late to change,” said Sumati Luvsandendev, political analyst and head of the Sant Maral Foundation, a Mongolian polling group."
-12.814314153434534," Rio Tinto hits cost blowout at Mongolia copper expansion (Reuters) - Rio Tinto on Tuesday flagged a cost blowout of up to $1.9 billion and a delay of up to 30 months at its Oyu Tolgoi underground copper mine in Mongolia, the miner’s key growth project. Rio said the delay stemmed from the project’s challenging geology. It expected to determine the preferred mine design, along with a final estimate of cost in the second half of 2020, and was also reviewing the value of its investment. The cost blowout was bigger than analysts had expected after the company had earlier flagged issues with the original mine design. Rio said first production could be achieved between May 2022 and June 2023, a delay of 16 to 30 months, while the capital cost of the project was estimated at $6.5 billion to $7.2 billion, up from an original estimate of $5.3 billion. “It is a world class orebody in terms of the size, the grade etc. What we are trying to work out now, is can it be developed and mined economically to convert what is a world class orebody into world class mine,” said Glyn Lawcock, analyst at UBS. “Overall, it was below our expectations for the quarter.” The news of the blowout came as Rio reported a 3.5% drop in second-quarter iron ore shipments, as disruptions caused by tropical cyclone Veronica in late March squeezed output in the April-June period. The company shipped 85.4 million tonnes of the steelmaking ingredient in the quarter ended June 30, down from 88.5 million tonnes a year earlier. Brokerage UBS had estimated quarterly shipments of 85.2 million tonnes. (bit.ly/2LUVXVu) Veronica ravaged the coast of Western Australia earlier this year, damaging several iron ore export hubs and prompting Australia’s biggest listed miners to cut their 2019 forecast for iron ore output. Rio on Tuesday maintained its annual iron ore exports forecast in the 320 million to 330 million tonnes range. In Mongolia, the miner said it had made significant progress at Oyu Tolgoi during 2019. “The ground conditions are more challenging than expected and we are having to review our mine plan and consider a number of options,” said Stephen McIntosh, Group executive, Growth & Innovation. “Delays are not unusual for such a large and complex project,” he added. Rio said it was reviewing the carrying value of its investment in Oyu Tolgoi and would announce if any changes were needed at its half-year results on Aug. 1.

Rio Tinto restarted the sale process for the assets in late 2018, with the help of French investment bank Natixis, sources previously said, after Norwegian aluminum company Norsk Hydro pulled out of buying them, blaming a delay in getting European Commission approval. Given Hydro is already a major player in the aluminum industry, the European Commission may have had competition concerns, the sources said. As well as an aluminum smelter in Iceland, Rio has put on the block a 53% stake in a Dutch anode facility and 50% of the shares in a Swedish aluminum fluoride plant, which are ingredients in aluminum production. Rio Tinto declined to comment. After a year of volatility caused by U.S. sanctions and supply reduction at Hydro’s massive Alunorte alumina plant in Brazil, the aluminum market has stabilized, which could make a sale easier to agree. Commodity trader and miner Glencore is among interested parties, the sources said. It had no immediate comment. Glencore, which doesn’t directly own aluminum assets, has offtake agreements with other producers, including U.S. Century Aluminium, in which it has a more than 40 percent stake, and Russia’s Rusal. Sources put Glencore’s agreements to buy aluminum from smelters around the world at a total of about 3 million tonnes or 10 percent of supply outside the biggest producer China. German aluminum producer Trimet Aluminium was also named by the sources as one of the companies that had expressed interest, but it said on Thursday that it was not interested in buying any aluminum plant. Iceland generates all its electricity from hydropower and geothermal energy. Rio’s aluminum plant therefore appeals to mining companies that face pressure from customers and investors to become more sustainable. Producing aluminum requires huge amounts of energy, meaning it is also cheaper to use hydropower. Rio sold an aluminum smelter in Dunkirk in France to Sanjeev Gupta’s Liberty House, which also bought the miner’s smelter in Lochaber, Scotland. One of the sources said Liberty House has also shown an interest in the assets, but its balance sheet may be constrained after its acquisition, agreed last year, of seven European plants from ArcelorMittal for 740 million euros ($835 million)."

Commodity trader and miner Glencore is among interested parties, the sources said. Glencore, which doesn’t directly own aluminium assets, has offtake agreements with other producers, including U.S. Century Aluminium, in which it has a more than 40 percent stake, and Russia’s Rusal. Sources put Glencore’s agreements to buy aluminium from smelters around the world at a total of about 3 million tonnes or 10 percent of supply outside the biggest producer China. German aluminium producer Trimet Aluminium is looking to increase production as part of its push to increase supply to the auto construction sector, betting on growth in electric vehicles, the sources said. Glencore and Trimet did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Iceland generates all its electricity from hydropower and geothermal energy. Rio’s aluminium plant therefore appeals to mining companies that face pressure from customers and investors to become more sustainable. Producing aluminium requires huge amounts of energy, meaning it is also cheaper to use hydropower. Rio sold an aluminium smelter in Dunkirk in France to Sanjeev Gupta’s Liberty House, which also bought the miner’s smelter in Lochaber, Scotland. One of the sources said Liberty House has also shown an interest in the assets, but its balance sheet may be constrained after its acquisition, agreed last year, of seven European plants from ArcelorMittal for 740 million euros ($835 million)."

The fund can also resume investing in Mexican tycoon Carlos Slim’s Grupo Carso, U.S. defense company General Dynamics and fertilizer-maker Nutrien, the board added in a statement. Reinvestments will likely take place “within an appropriately long timeframe,” said the board, without specifying a timeline. The fund is managed by a unit of the central bank. The fund, one of the world’s largest investors, has an ethical mandate set by parliament and is not allowed to invest in companies that produce nuclear weapons, cluster munitions and tobacco, among other ethical criteria. An ethical watchdog, the Council on Ethics, makes recommendations to the board of the central bank on whether companies should be excluded, reincluded or put on a watchlist, after which the board ultimately decides. Walmart, and its subsidiary Wal-Mart de Mexico SAB de CV, had been excluded from the fund’s investments since 2006 based on an assessment of “serious or systematic violations of human rights”. These included, in the ethics watchdog’s view, employing minors against international rules, allowing hazardous working conditions at suppliers and pressuring workers into overtime. “The Council on Ethics has found that the grounds for exclusions are no longer present,” the board of the central bank said in a statement. Walmart was unavailable for comment on Tuesday. It told Reuters in 2014 that it does not comment on any shareholders that buy or sell its stocks. “Our company provides a range of jobs, and along with training and development, our associates have strong career opportunities. We are proud of what our associates achieve and the opportunities that we provide around the world,” said a Walmart spokesman at the time. Miner Rio Tinto was excluded in 2008 based on the risk of causing severe environmental damage related to Indonesia’s Grasberg mine, the world’s second-largest copper mine. “The company has made it clear for the Council on Ethics that it has signed an agreement to sell its interest in the mine,” said the statement by the central bank’s board. Rio Tinto was not immediately available for comment. The issue was Rio Tinto’s stake in the mine, which according to the Norwegian finance ministry at the time, discharged very large amounts of tailings directly into a natural river system. Rio Tinto spokesman Nick Cobban said at the time of the exclusion: “We have an exemplary record in environmental matters, world-leading in fact, and they are given the very highest priority in everything we do.” “The current system of tailings is unquestionably the most appropriate given the high rainfall and seismically unstable geology in the area,” Cobban said. Fertilizer-maker Nutrien had been excluded from the fund in 2011 following an assessment of the risk of violations of fundamental ethical norms related to the company’s operations in Western Sahara, a contested territory between Morocco and the Algerian-backed Polisario since Spain left in 1974. “The Council on Ethics have found that these purchases now have ceased,” said the central bank’s board. Nutrien is “pleased with Norges Bank’s decision”, said a company spokesman, referring to the Norwegian name of the central bank. U.S. listed General Dynamics had been excluded from the fund in 2005 because it produced cluster munitions. “The company has made it clear for the Council on Ethics that such production has been terminated,” said the board. General Dynamics was not immediately available for comment. Grupo Carso SAB de CV was excluded from the fund in 2011 because it produced tobacco. “The company has made it clear ... that it is no longer involved in tobacco production,” said the board. Grupo Carso was not immediately available for comment."

The FTSE 100 index dipped 0.5%, its worst fall this month, while the FTSE 250 midcap index was down 0.3%. The indexes handed back some gains from Tuesday after a dovish policy speech by European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi. Anglo-Australian miner Rio Tinto fell 4.7% after it lowered its outlook for shipments from a hub in the Pilbara region in Australia due to a higher proportion of certain lower grade products. That had a knock-on effect on rivals as well, dragging the sectoral index nearly 3% lower to its worst day in more than six months. Online grocer Ocado fell nearly 6% to the bottom of the FTSE 100 index with a trader saying it was because of negative sentiment stemming from a media report on stiff competition in the quick delivery industry as Amazon.com tied up with Morrison. Upmarket food retailer Marks and Spencer dropped 4.5% after Tesco said it was considering a trial of an upmarket convenience store under the “Tesco finest” banner. British American Tobacco, Unilever and Reckitt Benckiser, which get a chunk of their revenue in U.S. dollars, weakened as the pound rallied before the BoE policy meeting where it might strike a relatively more confident tone than its counterparts. All eyes are now on the conclusion of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s two-day meeting after markets close. British Airways owner IAG fell 3.2%, after earlier touching a two-and-a-half-year low, and easyJet dropped 2.6%. HSBC downgraded the stocks after German airline Lufthansa’s profit warning this month. “We are increasingly cautious towards European airlines ... expect many will follow Lufthansa’s profit warning,” HSBC analysts wrote. They also forecast weakness in long-haul and corporate travel demand in Europe. Online takeaway service Just Eat lost 3.7% after a rating cut by UBS. British American Tobacco and Imperial Brands weakened after Nielsen data indicated that UK retail cigarette sales fell in May. Among midcaps, insurance and tourism firm Saga plunged 12.1% to a record low after warning that its tour operations were still being undercut by political uncertainty in Britain. Fashion retailer Ted Baker slumped 9% to a record low after HSBC slashed its price target by more than half to lowest compared to other brokerages. Clydesdale and Yorkshire Banking Group, however, jumped 6.2% after the lender laid out plans to challenge Britain’s big banks, betting that a re-brand as Virgin Money will help it shake up the market.

-13.500115480606908," Namibia says China can buy Rio's uranium stake if it respects laws WINDHOEK (Reuters) - Namibia’s mines and energy minister said he has no objection to Rio Tinto’s sale of its uranium mine stake to China provided it respects the African nation’s laws. Rio, which is seeking to divest less profitable assets, said last November that it was selling its 69% stake in the world’s longest-running open pit uranium mine to China for up to $106.5 million and expected the deal to be completed in the first half of 2019. Asked whether the sale would be cleared, Mines and Energy Minister Tom Alweendo told Reuters: “We have no objection to the sale provided that the buyer abides by what’s expected of him by our laws.” China already owns stakes in Namibian uranium production, which, along with diamonds, is the mainstay of the Namibian economy. Addressing concerns among Namibians that China will bring in foreign nationals to replace local employees, China National Uranium Corporation (CNUC) Vice President Li Youliang told a public hearing last week that was not the case. There was “no intention to replace local Namibian employees with foreign nationals solely as a result of this transaction,” he told the hearing in the coastal town of Swakopmund. “In fact, CNUC has a strong commitment to maintain the current level of local employees.” Rio Tinto is selling its stake in Rossing Uranium mine to CNUC in a deal dependent on approval from the Namibian competition commission. The Namibian government holds a 3% stake in Rossing and 51% of voting rights. The Iranian Foreign Investment Company also holds a legacy 15% stake that goes back to the original funding of the mine, which could have deterred some potential buyers. The other shareholders are the Development Corporation of South Africa (10%) and individual shareholders (3%). China is targeting nuclear power as an alternative to fossil fuels. It was the only obvious buyer of the shares in the Ros sing mine. Rossing has been operating since 1976 and has produced more uranium than any other mine. It employs around 1,000 workers and can carry on producing until 2025. The sale agreement comprises an initial cash payment of $6.5 million, payable at completion, and a contingent payment of up to $100 million following completion. The contingent payment is linked to uranium spot prices and Roofing’s net income during the next seven years. While China is a big source of uranium demand, the market has languished as Western countries turn away from the energy source and trade tensions between the United States and China are generally disrupting commodities trade. A spokesman for Rio Tinto declined to comment. (Refiles to correct typos in story that were due to technical problems.)"

While all seven directors were re-elected to the board, according to a Turquoise Hill filing, over 40% of Turquoise Hill’s minority shareholders, including its second-biggest investor, Sailingstone Capital Partners, voted against the four independent directors. Sailingstone last month flagged its vote in an open letter, citing governance issues and the board’s lack of engagement with minority investors. Turquoise Hill owns 66% of the Oyu Tolgoi copper mine in Mongolia, which is operated by Rio Tinto and expected to become one of the mining giant’s most lucrative properties. But it has been plagued by political challenges, corruption investigations and construction delays. Sailingstone has been engaged in a tussle with Turquoise Hill for years to improve corporate governance and alluded to the ""woeful performance"" of the company's stock in its April letter here. The San Francisco-based investment advisory firm, which owns 10.9% of Turquoise Hill, also blames mismanagement by Rio Tinto for delays to the completion of the main shaft at Oyu Tolgoi, which has led to delays to the start of production from its underground mine. Turquoise Hill shares have lost 58 percent over the past five years, compared with a 9 percent decline in the S&P/TSX Global Mining index. The shares fell 0.8% to C$1.77 on Tuesday afternoon, versus the benchmark’s 0.9% gain. While Turquoise Hill’s four independent directors won re-election with between 75% and 76% of total votes on Tuesday, between 40% and 48% of minority shareholder votes were not in their favor."
-13.37279410588861," BHP to keep Nickel West operations in Australia amid positive battery outlook (Reuters) - Global miner BHP Group will keep its Nickel West operations in Australia amid increasing demand for materials used to make batteries, its chief executive said on Tuesday. The company has previously made several attempts to sell its nickel operations in the state of Western Australia, saying as recently as 2017 that it was looking for a buyer. “Developments such as climate change and dramatic shifts in technology present both challenges and opportunities,” Andrew Mackenzie said in a speech to a mining conference in Barcelona that was broadcast over the Internet. “Nickel West, which we will now retain in the portfolio, offers high-return potential as a future growth option, linked to the expected growth in battery markets and the relative scarcity of quality nickel sulphide supply,” he said. Nickel is in increasing demand in new battery technologies that mean cars can travel further on a single charge. Using more nickel also cuts costs by reducing the amount of expensive cobalt, a mainstay of current electric vehicle (EV) battery technology. Western Australia is rich in nickel sulphides which can be chemically processed into sulphate."
-11.545726988630992," Rio Tinto to buy autonomous mining truck fleet from Caterpillar MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Rio Tinto has agreed to buy a fleet of autonomous trucks and other mining equipment from Caterpillar for its new Koodaideri iron ore mine in Western Australia, it said on Tuesday. Caterpillar will supply a fleet of 20 autonomous 793F trucks as well as four autonomous blast drills for the mine, which Rio is developing for $2.6 billion with first production expected to start by the end of 2021. The mine is expected to underpin Rio’s production of its flagship Pilbara Blend iron ore, sustaining its current output of more than 330 million tonnes a year which it draws from 16 mines in the region. “Beyond the autonomous fleet, Caterpillar will also provide loaders, dozers, graders, water carts and diggers for the operation which will be Rio Tinto’s first Pilbara mine to be primarily operated using Caterpillar machinery,” Rio said. Caterpillar’s machinery will be integrated into what Rio calls its first intelligent mine, to improve productivity across Rio Tinto’s entire iron ore network, it said. Australia’s iron ore miners are investing heavily in automation and machine learning in the arid Pilbara region to squeeze out costs, including removing drivers from what has been repetitive work in sometimes scorching conditions. The road hasn’t always been smooth, however, with a BHP Group train forcibly derailed after it ran away without its driver last year and a minor incident involving a driverless truck at a mine run by Fortescue in February."
0.8269929685440278," BHP cuts iron ore production outlook after Australian cyclone MELBOURNE (Reuters) - BHP Group, the world’s biggest miner, joined rival Rio Tinto on Wednesday in cutting its forecast for iron ore output after a tropical cyclone, although analysts expect high prices to limit any impact on profits. Cyclone Veronica tore down the coast of Western Australia in March, hitting several iron ore export hubs, in a return of more turbulent weather conditions after several moderate years. The lower production also led to a rise in BHP’s costs, while Rio Tinto suffered operational issues in the first quarter, including a fire at its Cape Lambert operations, said Brenton Saunders, an analyst at fund Pendal Group in Sydney. Miners, however, are benefiting from a surge in iron ore prices to near five-year highs on supply concerns following cyclone Veronica and a fatal dam collapse in Brazil that has cut operations at the world’s No. 1 iron ore miner Vale SA. “If the iron ore price wasn’t $96 and looking like it was going to go higher, then we would be having a very different conversation about these companies’ performance,” Saunders said. BHP, which put its fiscal 2019 iron ore production under review following the cyclone, lowered its forecast to 265 million-270 million tonnes, from 273 million-283 million tonnes. Iron ore output for the three months to end-March fell 5 percent to 64 million tonnes, down from 67 million tonnes a year ago. Rio Tinto, the world’s No. 2 iron ore miner, on Tuesday reported a 14 percent drop in quarterly iron ore shipments and trimmed its 2019 shipments estimate. BHP also increased its full-year production costs to less than $15 a ton, from less than $14 a ton previously, due to lower volumes and increased remediation costs. Since selling its onshore U.S. oil business last year, BHP is focused on just four commodities - iron ore, copper, coal and offshore oil and gas. The miner posted an 8 percent drop in quarterly copper production against year ago levels, mainly due to lower output at the world’s biggest copper mine, Escondida in Chile. However, it maintained annual production guidance for copper at 1.65 million tonnes to 1.74 million tonnes."

4.895576289484224," Dalian iron ore hits seven-week peak on firm industrial data, supply concerns BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s iron ore futures hit a 7-week-high on Monday after recording its best quarter in nine, buoyed by strong economic data and tight supply concerns after Rio Tinto cuts its 2019 output for iron ore shipments. The most-active iron ore contract for May delivery on the Dalian Commodity Exchange soared as much as 5.2 percent to 653.5 yuan ($97.40) a tonne, its highest since mid-February, before closing at 650 yuan. An official survey showed on Sunday factory activity in China unexpectedly grew for the first time in four months in March, suggesting government stimulus measures may be starting to take hold in the country. The improvement in business conditions was partly driven by increasing factory output, which posted its fastest pace in six months, and growing new orders. Firm iron ore prices also came as the world’s No.2 iron ore miner, Rio Tinto, cut its 2019 outlook for iron ore shipments from Australia’s Pilbara region due to tropical cyclone. That has further fueled supply concerns after it issued force majeure notices to some iron ore customers last week. “We expect iron ore arrivals to fall sharply in early April due to bad weather...Iron ore prices are expected to stay firm as steel mills start to replenish their inventory alongside the resuming operations,” said analysts from CITIC Futures in a note in Mandarin. Industrial plants in northern China have restarted some production after six months of environmental restrictions. Utilization rates at steel mills across China climbed for a second week last week as of March 29 to 63.64 percent, according to data tracked by Mysteel consultancy. However, government officials and industrial experts in China are calling on mills to restrain output, as the flooding of products in the market severely dents profit margins in the sector. An official from industrial ministry said on Saturday there will inspections across China in 2019 to ensure that factories aren’t re-starting closed capacity and no new capacity is being launched without approvals. Benchmark construction steel rebar prices on the Shanghai Futures Exchange gained 2.1 percent to 3,806 yuan a tonne. Hot-rolled coil futures climbed 1.9 percent to 3,778 yuan a tonne. Expectation of resuming operations at mills also lift prices of other steel-making ingredients. Dalian coking coal rose 1.5 percent to 1,248.5 yuan a tonne, while coke advanced 2.1 percent to 2,017 yuan."

The world’s No. 2 miner of the steelmaking material said annual Pilbara shipments are now expected to be at the lower end of its previous guidance of between 338 and 350 million tonnes. Rio’s 2018 iron ore shipments from the region totaled 338.2 million tonnes. The damage from the cyclone coupled with a fire at a port facility in January will lead to a loss of about 14 million tonnes of production in 2019, the miner said in a statement. On Friday, Rio issued force majeure notices to some iron ore customers due to damage from the cyclone. Force majeure is invoked when a company tells a counterparty it cannot perform a contractual obligation due to circumstances outside its control.

Tropical Cyclone Veronica pummeled iron ore export ports on the northern coast of Western Australia before weakening and gradually moving west. Meanwhile, Cyclone Trevor landed in northern Queensland and then moved into the Gulf of Carpentaria where it made landfall before being downgraded to a low-pressure system on Sunday. Rio Tinto said on Tuesday that staff were returning to its ports and rail operations in Western Australia and that mining was resuming at its Robe Valley operations in the state. “With weather clearing, staff will gradually start returning to affected port and rail sites today with normal operations to resume once it is safe to do so,” Rio said. In a separate statement, it said operations at its bauxite mine in Weipa, Queensland, have been ramped back up after they were closed last Wednesday ahead of the bad weather. Bauxite is the raw material used to make aluminum. “Rio Tinto Weipa Operations have returned to normal activities with both ports fully operational by Sunday afternoon,” it said in an emailed statement. The miner noted that there were no injuries to employees or contractors as a result of the cyclone in Weipa. It did not give any estimate for any production that may have been impacted. Meanwhile, BHP Group said that it had found no major damage to its iron ore operations as clean-up work and systems and equipment safety checks were underway at Port Headland. “Our employees and contractors have commenced returning to work in preparation for production to recommence. We expect to restart loading ships today with production ramping up over the next few days,” BHP said in statement. The Pilbara Ports Authority, which operates the iron ore exporting ports of Port Hedland and Ashburton, said in a statement it had reopened both sites following infrastructure assessments. There was no significant infrastructure damage at either port and operations would return to normal in the next 24 hours, it added. Iron ore producer Fortescue Metals Group Ltd said its Port Hedland sites experienced minor flooding but its mining and processing operations continued unaffected over the weekend.

9.106850708338527," U.S. judge says Rio Tinto must face SEC fraud case NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Monday rejected Rio Tinto Plc’s bid to dismiss a Securities and Exchange Commission lawsuit accusing the Anglo-Australian mining company of civil fraud in its handling of a failed investment in a Mozambique coal project. U.S. District Judge Analisa Torres in Manhattan said the regulator may pursue some claims in its October 2017 lawsuit against Rio Tinto, former Chief Executive Officer Tom Albanese and former Chief Financial Officer Guy Elliott. Torres narrowed the main fraud claim against Rio Tinto and Albanese to focus on the former CEO’s statements about Mozambique growth prospects, finding no proof they intended to overvalue Rio Tinto Coal Mozambique (“RTCM”) by more than $3 billion. Albanese and Elliott still face SEC claims that their actions led to the overvaluation appearing in a semi-annual Rio Tinto financial report. Rio Tinto’s market value is more than $93 billion, making the company one of the biggest in the SEC’s crosshairs. Rio Tinto and lawyers for the defendants did not immediately respond to requests for comment. An SEC spokesman declined to comment. The SEC accused the defendants of deceiving investors over Mozambique coal assets that Rio Tinto bought in 2011 for $3.7 billion, through a takeover of the former Riversdale Mining. By overvaluing the assets, despite an internal assessment that they were worth negative $680 million, Rio Tinto was able to raise more than $5.5 billion from unsuspecting U.S. investors, according to the SEC. Evidence included an internal May 2012 email from an RTCM executive that flagged poor communication between ministries, and the alleged “influence of corruption on decision-making.” Rio Tinto took a more than $3 billion writedown for Mozambique in January 2013. It sold the assets in late 2014 for $50 million. The surviving SEC case includes a claim that Albanese intended to mislead investors in 2012 by describing the Moatize Basin, where RTCM was located, as a world-class basin coal deposit and long-term growth opportunity. “Through these statements, Albanese was misrepresenting material facts to investors,” Torres wrote in her 50-page decision. In court papers, the defendants said the SEC had failed to establish fraud, and was “plainly wrong” to conclude a big writedown was needed sooner, given the complexities of the accounting procedures and valuation assessments. The Australian Securities and Investments Commission brought its own civil claims against Rio Tinto, Albanese and Elliott. The case is SEC v Rio Tinto Plc et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 17-07994."

9.106850708338527," Rio asks shareholders to vote against emissions resolution MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Rio Tinto said on Monday it would recommend that shareholders vote against a resolution requiring the miner to report its direct emissions and those of its customers in greater detail. In a notice ahead of its annual general meeting in May, Rio said shareholders should vote against the proposed rule change that would have it set transition plans that adhere to the goals of the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit). Those plans would include short-, medium- and long-term targets to reduce scope 1, 2 and 3 greenhouse gas emissions, and detailed strategies to meet the targets in each annual report starting from 2020, according to the proposed resolution. Scope 1 emissions refer to direct emissions from company’s activities, scope 2 emissions are indirect such as from purchased power. Scope 3 emissions are those created by customers of a company’s product. “Rio Tinto is currently undertaking detailed engineering, economic and policy analysis on an asset-by-asset basis to inform new Scope 1 and 2 emissions reduction targets to replace our existing targets, which expire in 2020,” Chairman Simon Thompson said in a filing to the Australian bourse. Rio Tinto, which released its own climate change report last month, advised voting against the plan because it was not in control of its customers emissions, and because an analysis it was currently undergoing was based on a different framework. “Scope 3 emissions are primarily the emissions of our customers, mainly steel makers in China, over which we have very limited control.” The emissions resolution was submitted by Melbourne-based non-profit Market Forces, acting as agent for 109 shareholders who hold approximately 0.02 percent of the Australian listing. “By recommending shareholders vote against this resolution, Rio Tinto has failed to take the opportunity to assure shareholders that its new emission reduction targets will be entirely consistent with the climate goals set out in the Paris Agreement,” Will van de Pol at Market Forces told Reuters. Rio said its current analysis was based on “less than 2 degrees”, reflecting a scenario for sustainable development from the International Energy Agency, and that it would release targets and strategies on how to meet them in 2020. Rio is among Australia’s top five carbon emitters, according to combined data from the Clean Energy Regulator. The miner said it produced 28.6 million tonnes of scope 1 and 2 emissions last year, and 536.0 million tonnes of Scope 3 emissions, but that it was on track to beat a target of reducing its emissions intensity by 24 percent from 2008 levels by 2020."

7.336265659884095," Rio Tinto talking to Apple on next step of carbon-free aluminum project WEIPA, Australia (Reuters) - Rio Tinto is in talks to move into the next phase of an agreement with Apple, Chief Executive Jean-Sebastien Jacques said on Friday, as the miner looks to transition its aluminum business to tap a low-carbon economy. Last May, Rio and Alcoa announced a joint venture, backed by Apple, to commercialize by 2024 a process that emits oxygen and replaces all direct greenhouse gas emissions from the traditional smelting process for aluminum. Bauxite is the raw material for aluminum, which is used in everything from beer cans to aeroplanes and is expected to gain greater use in a decarbonizing economy as a lightweight alternative to steel. However, it is still one of the most carbon-intensive metals to produce. “At the end of the day, what we can see is the customers of our customers want to have full traceability on their products, and they want to make sure they have a carbon-friendly product,” Jacques said on Friday at the unveiling of Rio’s new Amrun bauxite mine in northern Australia. “The technology that we are developing is - instead of using the carbon anodes - is to use an anode made of ceramic so you would not consume any carbon, and you would not release any CO2 into the atmosphere,” he said. Rio, which has pledged substantial decarbonization by 2050, is reshaping its aluminum division longer term to focus on supply chain transparency and lowering emissions, Jacques said. “We are looking at the next wave of partnership with Apple,” Jacques said, although he provided no further details. If the new smelting process under development proves commercially viable, he said, Rio would retrofit its entire fleet of existing smelters with the technology. The miner has also taken steps to have its Amrun bauxite mine certified by a scheme that signifies it is ethically sourced, given its land use, heritage and working agreements with local indigenous groups. “(We will show) that Amrun is part of the supply chain, so we can demonstrate from the bauxite to the aluminum in your iPhone or in your laptop, we fully understand the entire chain and that is consistent with what customers like Apple want,” Jacques said. Global mining majors have been highlighting their climate and community credentials as they look to repair an image tarnished by environmental disasters and overspending, amid pressure from investors with an environmental, social and governance, or ESG, agenda. Jacques said in Melbourne last year that mining had an image problem as “one of the least trusted on the planet”. Rio has several aluminum plants in Australia and is among the country’s top five carbon emitters, according to combined data from the Clean Energy Regulator that counts direct emissions and indirect emissions from purchased power use. In a climate report last month, Rio said it produced 28.6 million tonnes of such emissions last year but that it was on track to beat a target of reducing its emissions intensity by 24 percent from 2008 levels by 2020."
6.311752534683751," Rio Tinto says Amrun bauxite mine set for full production WEIPA, Australia (Reuters) - Global miner Rio Tinto said on Friday that its $1.9 billion Amrun bauxite mine in northern Australia is set to enter full production after finishing its ramp-up phase, boosting output at its Weipa operations by more than a third. Rio Tinto produces about 50 million tonnes of the aluminum raw material globally, accounting for around 15 percent of world supply. The Amrun mine will produce 22.8 million tonnes at full production, and take Rio’s bauxite output at Weipa on Australia’s northern tip to 35 million tonnes a year, the company said. “The mine and associated processing and port facilities will replace production from Rio Tinto’s depleting East Weipa mine and increase annual bauxite export capacity by around 10 million tonnes, at a time when higher grade bauxite is becoming scarcer globally,” Rio Chief Executive JS Jacques said in a statement. Amrun, which was approved in November 2015, had originally been expected to begin production and shipping in the first half of 2019 and hit full production by the end of the year. reut.rs/2ETI9Xp In what it called an industry first, Rio Tinto was able to cut construction time by a year as the 1 km-long (0.6-mile) export facility was built in modules off-site and then brought to Amrun and hooked up, rather than having all the construction done over-water. Bauxite mining has taken place at Weipa for more than 50 years, and the new mine will extend the operations for another 50 years, Jacques said. Aluminum, a lightweight metal, is used in mobile phones and transportation like planes and trucks. “Aluminum is one of the fastest growing base metals in the world. We forecast demand to grow steadily and remain robust,” Jacques said. The first shipment from the mine sailed in December."

6.156372696180487," Hedge fund Odey's new commodity fund goes short on Rio copper mine: Financial Times LONDON (Reuters) - Hedge fund Odey Asset Management has launched a new commodities fund which, according to the Financial Times, has taken a short position in Rio Tinto’s giant Oyu Tolgoi copper mine in Mongolia. The Odey Concentrated Natural Resources Fund, which launched on March 1, will invest in the commodity sector, using both long and short positions in a range of asset classes, but mostly equities, according to Odey’s website. A spokeswoman for Odey declined to provide details, but the Financial Times reported the largest short position of the fund was in Turquoise Hill Resources, the Canadian firm that partly owns Oyu Tolgoi. The government of Mongolia owns 34 percent of Oyu Tolgoi with the remainder held by Turquoise Hill, which in turn is 51 percent owned by Rio Tinto. Turquoise Hill shares have shed 46 percent over the past 12 months amid delays to an underground expansion at Oyu Tolgoi that would create one of the world’s biggest copper suppliers. At the end of last year, Rio and Mongolia signed a power supply deal, regarded as the last hurdle for the extension of the mine. First production at the $5.3 billion underground expansion located near the southern border with China is scheduled for early next decade. In January, Mongolia’s anti-graft body said the country was working with overseas investigators to look into claims of corruption at Oyu Tolgoi."
11.579630144872546," Rio Tinto posts best underlying earnings in four years, offloads cash (Reuters) - Rio Tinto on Wednesday beat expectations when it reported its highest annual underlying earnings since 2014 and announced a bumper dividend after a string of divestments. Flush from the recent sale of its stake in the Grasberg copper mine in Indonesia and other non-core aluminum and coal assets, Rio will have returned total cash of $13.5 billion to shareholders for the year, after declaring a $4 billion special dividend of $2.43 per share and a final dividend of $1.80. The special dividend was “far bigger than expected,” said analyst Glyn Lawcock of UBS in Sydney. “I think this continues to deliver on their promise of returning cash to shareholders and not doing anything dumb,” he said, a reference to the top-of-the-cycle asset purchases at the peak of the last commodity boom. “We have once again announced record cash returns to shareholders,” Chief Executive Jean-Sébastien Jacques said, pointing to the miner’s “value over volume” strategy. Underlying earnings for the 12 months ended on Dec. 31 rose to $8.81 billion, from $8.63 billion a year earlier, after its copper and minerals divisions beat expectations, offsetting higher aluminum costs. The figure was significantly higher than a consensus estimate of $8.47 billion compiled by Vuma Financial. Chief Commercial Officer Simon Trott told reporters on a media call that Rio had little scope to boost its iron ore output after a deadly dam burst cut supply from Brazil’s Vale SA. “The iron ore business is set up for the year. You can’t make changes on the fly. But we will continue to look at options on the portfolio for the year,” Trott said. Iron ore prices have surged since last month’s deadly collapse of a dam operated by Vale in Brazil forced the world’s top iron ore miner to cut production, likely boosting earnings this year for its global rivals. Rio maintained its iron ore output guidance at 338 million to 350 million tonnes. Rio’s Australia-listed shares have risen 21 percent so far this year, compared with a near 15 percent jump for its larger, but more diversified, peer BHP Group. In London, Rio’s shares were up 1.3 percent. The Vale disaster has considerably raised scrutiny of safety standards throughout the industry, in particular for tailings facilities, casting a shadow over the industry’s license to operate. Rio, which has some 100 tailings facilities across 32 sites, registered three fatalities last year. The miner also separately released a major report into its plans to transition into a low carbon future, and Jacques made a point of underlining its Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) credentials. “Today we are the only large mining company with no coal or oil or gas in our portfolio,” he said. While a global move to a low carbon future lent significant risk to its iron ore business, Rio said in its report that it will focus on materials like copper and aluminum that will supply a new energy future. Rio Tinto also separately confirmed a copper find in Western Australia."

The uranium miner said in a statement that the rehabilitation provision for its Northern Territory project was now estimated at A$830 million ($587 million) as of Dec. 31, compared with a previous estimate of A$808 million as at Dec. 6. The Ranger project is controversial because of its proximity to the Aboriginal-occupied Kakadu National Park. ERA has been selling stockpiled uranium from the Ranger since 2016 to fund closure of the mine, and it said in its statement that it would continue to sell uranium from existing stockpiles. (reut.rs/2Dl8NGl) In December, ERA had raised its provision for the mine by about A$296 million to A$808 million, which was reflected in its 2018 net loss from continuing operations, which widened 10-fold to A$435.3 million. ERA’s shares reversed course to trade about 7.3 percent lower after the Friday announcement. Mathan Somasundaram, an analyst with Blue Ocean Equities said that while ERA’s results were dismal, the stock had gained substantially this year. “People are using the results to take some profit off the table, its not running because of the result per-se more so because the commodity has been having a pretty good run,” Somasundaram said.

Mined copper production beat its guidance, mostly due to higher grades and better productivity at Rio Tinto’s Kennecott operations in the Utah, the company said in a statement. Rio’s fourth-quarter iron ore production stood at 86.6 million tonnes, down by 1 percent from the fourth quarter of 2017, due to fewer shipments. Meanwhile its outlook for iron ore production for this year, was in a range of 338 million tonnes to 350 million tonnes, making a Vuma consensus of 348.8 million tonnes at the top end of its guidance. The world’s No. 2 miner of the steelmaking material declared force majeure on iron ore shipments to some customers following a fire at its Cape Lambert export terminal in Australia earlier this month. Combined, global miners are expected to have shipped out less iron ore in the last quarter of 2018 than in 2017, however buoyant iron ore prices are expected to drive a solid season for earnings. “You’d have to say it’s a pretty good result. It’s not shooting the lights out, but given the economic background, you can’t really complain too much,” said analyst David Lennox at Fat Prophets in Sydney. Shares in Rio rose 0.5 percent to A$80.81 ($58.08) by 2312 GMT. Rio’s 2018 iron ore shipments from Australia’s Pilbara region totaled 338.2 million tonnes, up 2 percent from 330.1 million tonnes the year before on the back of productivity gains, in line with a Vuma consensus of 339.2 million tonnes. The Anglo-Australian miner had given guidance of 330 million to 340 million tonnes. In November, Rio officially bankrolled a $2.6 billion futuristic iron ore mine in the resource-rich Pilbara region, aiming to cash in on the rising Chinese demand for finer ore. “We delivered a solid operational performance in the final quarter of 2018, in particular across our copper assets,” Chief Executive Officer Jean-Sebastien Jacques said. For 2018, the London-headquartered miner posted a 33 percent jump in mined copper production to 633,500 tonnes, beating its guidance of between 510,000-610,000 tonnes. It set a 2019 target to churn out between 550,000 tonnes and 600,000 tonnes of mined copper. The solid outlook for copper coupled with Rio’s desire to reduce its reliance on iron ore has prompted the miner to boost its copper assets. Inflation of raw materials costs that negatively impacted its aluminum business in the first half of the year continued into the second half, it noted.

Rio Tinto’s share of lump and fines production from the joint venture was 8.7 million tonnes in the first half of 2018. “The fire has had no impact on the shipping of all other Pilbara iron ore products,” the company said. Cape Lambert is one of two ports Rio uses to ship iron ore from Australia’s Pilbara mining region. The port has an annual iron ore shipping capacity of 205 million tonnes, according to the miner’s website. Cape Lambert is about 1,250 km (780 miles) north of the Western Australia capital of Perth."
38.697636030506786," Rio Tinto, Mongolia sign power deal for Oyu Tolgoi copper mine (This Dec. 31 story was refiled to add the full name in paragraph 11) LONDON/ULAANBAATAR (Reuters) - Rio Tinto and Mongolia have signed a deal for the supply of power to the miner’s giant copper mine extension at Oyu Tolgoi by mid-2023, with both sides saying the framework agreement marked a step forward after a protracted dispute. The Oyu Tolgoi project is central to Rio Tinto’s push to diversify its portfolio away from iron ore, but it has faced a series of challenges as Mongolia’s fragile government wrangles over how to maximise benefits for the country. First production at the $5.3 billion underground expansion located near the southern border with China is scheduled for early next decade, creating one of the world’s biggest copper suppliers. The construction of a 300 megawatt plant, close to the Tavan Tolgoi coalfields, to supply electricity to the mine will start in 2020 under the new agreement. The plant is expected to be operational by mid-2023, slightly later than the 2022 date mooted after the government cancelled an earlier power agreement in February. The government of Mongolia owns 34 percent of Oyu Tolgoi with the remainder held by Turquoise Hill Resources, which in turn is 51 percent owned by Rio Tinto. In a joint statement with Oyu Tolgoi, the Mongolian government said the agreement was “a significant step towards enhancing the efficiency of the Tavan Tolgoi coal mines,” and to supplying the wider region with domestic power. The statement said the partners would also consider how to incorporate the use of renewable power. Oyu Tolgoi would be the majority owner of the power plant, with funding possibly including third party debt, the statement said, without giving further details. Analysts welcomed the deal but said the 2023 deadline looked optimistic. “This was the last major hurdle for the underground production,” Munkhdul Badral Bontoi, chief executive of Mongolia-based market intelligence group Cover Mongolia, said. A Mongolian government spokesman said the agreement was the first step to retain in the country the estimated $150 million Oyu Tolgoi currently pays China for electricity each year, with the figure set to rise when the underground extension comes online. Rio Tinto in July entered agreements with three Chinese contractors on designing a power station to supply Oyu Tolgoi. On Monday, a spokesman declined to comment on the status of those tenders. Rio Tinto’s shares have fallen by around 5 percent this year and were down 0.9 percent on Monday."

The $940 million rail project, AutoHaul, is focused on driverless train movement to transport ore to the company’s port operations and has been in development since 2012. “Early results indicate significant potential to improve productivity, providing increased system flexibility and reducing bottlenecks,” Ivan Vella, Rio Tinto’s iron ore managing director Rail, Port & Core Services, said. Rio Tinto operates about 200 locomotives on more than 1,700 km of track in Pilbara to transport ore from 16 mines to four port terminals.

29.476793706011286," Rio Tinto plans to list Canadian iron ore unit in early 2019: sources (Reuters) - Anglo-Australian miner Rio Tinto RIO.LRIO.AX is preparing to take its Iron Ore Company of Canada business public in the first half of 2019 by dual-listing it in New York and Toronto, people familiar with the situation told Reuters. The company has hired investment banks Royal Bank of Canada RY.TO, Credit Suisse CSGN.S and JPMorgan Chase JPM.N to lead the IPO, according to sources who spoke on condition of anonymity as the information is not public. Rio Tinto, the world’s second-biggest listed miner, is targeting a valuation of about $4 billion, they said. While Rio did not see much traction with a sale process, it has not ruled that out, the people said. The IPO plans would depend on market conditions improving, the people added. With high levels of volatility, global markets have fallen because of concerns about geopolitical risks and economic growth. A spokesman for Rio declined to comment. With operations in Labrador and Newfoundland, Iron Ore Company of Canada is a major producer of iron ore in the country. Rio Tinto owns a 58.7 percent stake, Japan's Mitsubishi Corp 8058.T owns 26.2 percent and Canada's Labrador Iron Ore Royalty Co LIF.TO owns 15.1 percent. IOC reported revenue of $1.9 billion in 2017. Rio has tried, and failed, to monetise Iron Ore Company of Canada in the past and is keen to get it right this time, the sources said. Rio tried unsuccessfully to sell its IOC stake in 2012-13. This year it said it had also been unable to close a sale of its stake in the Simandou iron ore project in Guinea. Iron ore, which accounts for most of Rio’s profit and is used in making steel, has provided healthy margins for years but the outlook is uncertain as major buyer China is expected increasingly to rely on recycling rather than importing raw material. Following a commodity price crash in 2015, Rio put a range of assets on the block, mostly coal, to cut its debt. In iron ore, its push to refocus on its best assets has meant concentrating on Australia’s Pilbara region, where it has low costs and relatively high grades. Labrador Iron Ore Royalty Corp also provides relatively unpolluting iron ore concentrate and pellets, which command a premium. The accelerated IPO plans for Rio Tinto underscore an eagerness among potential IPO candidates to get out to market early in 2019 amid fears market conditions could sour later in the year. In the tech world, ride-hailing companies Uber Technologies and Lyft Inc have both filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and could go public in the first half of 2019."
27.7965321046689," Breakingviews - Rio will turn big miners back into big spenders SINGAPORE (Reuters Breakingviews) - Rio Tinto will be first on the spending trail. The Anglo-Australian giant and peers like BHP have been steadily churning out cash, but investors have understandably fretted this will be wasted on overpriced deals – as happened during the last boom. Expect that to change in 2019. Rio boss Jean-Sébastien Jacques has multiple reasons to concentrate on copper. Long-term, the price outlook is more appealing than its current main focus, iron ore. With big new deposits rare, slow and expensive, supply of the red metal will eventually lag demand as the world further electrifies. In the short-term, though more a gauge of sentiment, copper for three-month delivery was trading around $6,100 in December, below the level required to encourage miners to dig for more. What Jacques needs is a target. The most likely candidate is $15 billion Freeport-McMoRan. The world’s largest listed copper producer faces a debate over who will lead it when current boss Richard Adkerson, 71, retires. It also operates largely in the right places – Chile and Peru, plus the United States, which will put off rival Chinese suitors. For Western names, Freeport’s exotic mines have been poison pills. But it sold Congo’s Tenke Fungurume in 2016, and has unpicked a knot in Indonesia too. Grasberg is one of the world’s richest mines but challenging, and Rio agreed to sell its own interest in 2018. Having agreed to cede its majority stake to a local group, though, Freeport has also paved the way for an eventual full exit. There are complications. One is price: Freeport’s shares are worth roughly a fifth what they were in 2011, but copper deals are so scarce that Rio may have to pay a premium of at least 30 percent. That would mean an equity value of over $19 billion, representing a punchy 17 times expected 2019 earnings. Still, back-of-the-envelope calculations imply a return on investment roughly in line with a 10 percent cost of capital, even without cost savings. Rio would certainly have to woo investors. But its debt burden is light. Plus, it could spin off some of the U.S. mines. It could also accelerate efforts to list a majority stake in Iron Ore Company of Canada. Jacques has other options, like First Quantum or even the Latin American copper assets of Anglo American, if a long-awaited carve-up happens.

28.61229692274557," Rio Tinto partner says yet to make big copper find at Western Australia site MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Exploration by Rio Tinto at one of its sites in a part of Western Australia that has been touted as potentially rich in copper has so far failed to find any economically viable veins of ore, the miner’s partner in the project said on Tuesday. Antipa Minerals lodged a series of exploration updates with the Australian Securities Exchange on Tuesday including one covering its Citadel project with Rio in the state’s Paterson province. Antipa noted “weak mineralization” in the Folly target area that is part of that project, adding that at this stage there was “no follow-up envisaged”. It said that no follow-up was warranted at the MB1 target area either. However, it said it was still exploring around the Calibre deposit, with the results of an aerial electro-magnetic survey still pending. Rio, which declined to comment, is exploring on Antipa’s holdings under a farm-in deal which gives it rights to buy into a joint venture with Antipa. It holds a separate set of exploration rights in the region where it is building an airport and setting up a mining camp, stirring speculation of a major find as explorers have flocked to the area. “The grades are low - they didn’t come up with any really high-grade intersections,” said Warren Edney at broker Ballieu Holst in Melbourne. “It doesn’t kill the story...this is not all of Rio’s ground. It means that Rio would be prioritizing their own work program.” In the past year, Rio has boosted its exploration holdings tenfold in the Paterson, beyond its shared ground with Antipa as miners step up exploration to secure growth. Rio’s interest in the area, which already hosts one of Australia’s largest copper and gold mines - Newcrest’s Telfur, has sparked a stampede into adjacent lots by other explorers, who see Rio’s aggressive activity as an indicator of a highly-promising find. Under the terms of its deal with Antipa, Rio Tinto will make escalating payments to the explorer of up to A$60 million ($43.19 million) to reach a stake of up to 75 percent in the joint venture. If it completes the current stage to April 2020, Rio would have a 51-percent joint venture interest. “At a quick glance, the drill results show that the grade isn’t high enough to be economic,” said a mining engineer, declining to be identified due to the sensitivity of the topic. “It’s still early days, but if this is where they are focusing and those are the kind of results they are getting, it’s nothing to write home about. Particularly if you’re Rio.”"

23.750819550950144," Rio Tinto approves $2.6 bln 'intelligent' iron ore mine for Australia MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Rio Tinto, the world’s No. 2 iron-ore miner, gave the long-awaited green light for an “intelligent” iron ore mine in Western Australia on Thursday, raising its expected cost by nearly 20 percent from the original plan. Approval for the $2.6 billion Koodaideri mine marks Rio Tinto’s biggest investment commitment since 2016, when it signed off on a $5.3 billion underground expansion of the Oyu Tolgoi copper mine in Mongolia. Rio has previously called Koodaideri its first “intelligent” mine, as it will be using systems that connect driverless trucks, trains and drills for the first time, using data analytics to optimize production, improve safety and cut downtime. “Koodaideri is a game-changer for Rio Tinto. It will be the most technologically advanced mine we have ever built and sets a new benchmark for the industry,” Chief Executive Jean-Sébastien Jacques said in a statement. Costs for Koodaideri, due to start producing in 2021, have risen as Rio expanded the planned capacity to 43 million tonnes from 40 million tonnes and added an airport, new roads and safety features to the project. Rio Tinto said rising labor and materials costs had also added to the original cost estimate of $2.2 billion. It expects construction will involve more than 2,000 people. The project will be competing for workers and equipment in the iron-rich Pilbara region, where rivals BHP Group and Fortescue Metals Group are also digging new mines. Koodaideri is expected to underpin Rio’s production of its flagship Pilbara Blend iron ore, sustaining its current output of more than 330 million tonnes a year. It is still considering a second phase to expand the mine to more than 70 million tonnes. Rio Tinto’s shares jumped 3 percent in early trade on Thursday, outperforming the broader market and BHP, but just behind Fortescue."

24.89378117653207," Rio Tinto sells stake in Namibia uranium mine to China for $107 million LONDON (Reuters) - Rio Tinto RIO.AXRIO.L will sell its 69 percent stake in a Namibian uranium mine to China National Uranium Corp (CNUC) for up to $106.5 million, it said on Monday, as China seeks to bolster supplies and Rio offloads less-profitable assets. Analysts said that China, which is targeting nuclear power as an alternative to fossil fuels and already owns stakes in Namibian uranium production, was an obvious buyer of the shares in the Rossing mine. Rossing is the world’s longest-running open pit uranium mine, operating since 1976, and has produced more uranium than any other mine. The Iranian Foreign Investment Company holds a legacy 15 percent stake that goes back to the original funding of the mine, which could have been a problem for some potential buyers. An industry source close to the deal, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there had been interest from private equity and from China. The other shareholders are the Namibian government (3 percent), the Development Corporation of South Africa (10 percent) and individual shareholders (3 percent). Rio Tinto Chief Executive Jean-Sebastien Jacques said the company would work closely with CNUC “to ensure a smooth transition and ongoing sustainable operation at Rossing”. No one from CNUC was immediately available for comment, though an executive at China National Nuclear Corp said in October it was looking to secure supply for an expected ramp-up in China’s nuclear power generation. The sale is also in line with global miner Rio Tinto’s disposal strategy, following on from its exit from thermal coal this year. It is also trying to sell some of its aluminum assets. Monday’s binding agreement comprises an initial cash payment of $6.5 million, payable at completion, and a contingent payment of up to $100 million following completion. The contingent payment is linked to uranium spot prices and Rossing’s net income during the next seven years. The transaction is subject to merger approval from the Namibian Competition Commission, with expected completion in the first half of 2019. Rio Tinto's London share price eased 0.3 percent on Monday, against a 0.5 percent gain for the sector index. .FTNMX1770 The mining sector as a whole has weakened this year as the recovery of 2016-17 has faltered and doubts have surfaced about Chinese demand in the face of trade tensions with the United States."
23.82658042500926," METALS-Zinc prices rise on tight supply, copper steadies * Premium for cash zinc versus benchmark near 21 yr high * Wider markets rattled by rising China-U.S. trade tensions (Update prices) LONDON, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Zinc rose on Thursday on persistent supply tightness while copper steadied as investors weighed a weaker U.S. dollar against worries about a looming global growth slowdown and escalating Sino-U.S. trade tensions. The premium for cash zinc over the three-month contract MZN0-3 touched a 21-year high of $97 a tonne on Tuesday due to falling stocks in London Metal Exchange (LME) warehouses. It was trading at $90 on Thursday. At 123,500 tonnes, LME stocks have roughly halved since mid-August. MZNSTX-TOTAL “There’s clearly not a lot of metal in the system so the price is responding to those signals of extreme tightness,” said Vivienne Lloyd, analyst at Macquarie. “We’re friendly towards zinc, have been for a while. It’s got an underlying bearish case but on a two-, three-, four-month basis it’s quite a tight metal market. I wouldn’t say that’s entirely priced in at this stage.” In the wider markets, global equities wilted as investor worries mounted about growth slowing in the face of rising U.S. interest rates and trade tensions. The dollar fell, however, making dollar-priced metals cheaper for non-U.S. investors. China, the world’s top metals user, rejected fresh U.S. accusations of perpetuating “unfair” trade practices and urged Washington to stop making provocations, showing little sign of backing down a few days ahead of a high-stakes meeting between leaders of both countries. PRICES: Benchmark LME zinc closed up 0.6 percent at $2,582 a tonne and up 3.6 percent so far this month. Copper finished 0.3 percent higher at $6,255 a tonne, and has notched up gains of around 4.3 percent this month. TECHNICALS: Zinc faces major resistance at the November high of $2,647, while copper faces major resistance at its November high of $6,315, broker Marex Spectron said in a note. POSITIONS: Traders are keeping a close eye on positions holding large amounts of LME copper warrants and cash contracts, which are causing jitters about nearby availability. <0#LME-WHC> ALUMINIUM SUPPLY: Xinfa Group, one of China’s top aluminium smelters, will not have to cut metal production in its home city of Liaocheng this winter and will only have to reduce alumina output by 10 percent for two months. STEEL: China’s steel sector is toying with falling into a bear market, with prices down almost 20 percent in the past three months as a run of record production meets the reality of a slowing economy and trade disputes. PRICES: LME aluminium finished down 0.3 percent at $1,947 a tonne, lead closed 0.6 percent lower at $1,994.50, tin rose 0.1 percent to $19,250 and nickel fell 0.5 percent to $10,970."
14.17572366964145," Rio Tinto, Nespresso join forces to make coffee pods greener LONDON (Reuters) - Nespresso, part of food giant Nestle, aims to use sustainable aluminum in all of its coffee capsules by 2020 under a deal with mining major Rio Tinto announced on Monday. Both companies have faced criticism for adding to pressure on the planet, with campaigners saying Nespresso coffee machines are wasteful and many of the used capsules end up in landfill. Under the deal, Anglo-Australian Rio Tinto will supply aluminum produced with renewable power and respect for biodiversity to Nespresso, the world leader in the coffee pod market. The companies are seeking to position themselves as sustainable to boost their investor and customer appeal, and Nespresso has committed to 100 percent sustainable aluminum for its capsules by 2020, Rio Tinto said in a statement released on Monday Australia time. Rio Tinto Chief Executive Jean-Sebastien Jacques said last month that miners needed new partnerships as the sector competes for talent and seeks to improve its image. Its aluminum assets use hydropower - for economic as well as environmental reasons - and in April the miner became the world’s first producer of aluminum to be certified by the Aluminium Stewardship Initiative (ASI). ASI standards are based on protecting biodiversity, respecting indigenous peoples’ rights and traceability throughout the supply chain, as well as lower emissions and renewable energy. So far, only part of Rio’s aluminum production is ASI-certified. Rio Tinto Vice President Sales and Marketing Tolga Egrilmezer said in an interview that the deal with Nespresso was “a significant milestone for the industry” towards wider use of responsibly-sourced aluminum. While the mining sector has recovered from the commodity crash of 2015-16, it is struggling to win investment because of concerns about governance in difficult regions where mines are often located and because of its exposure to coal, the most carbon-intensive fuel. Rio Tinto has sold its coal mines, but still uses coal power in some operations. In May, Rio Tinto announced a venture with aluminum maker Alcoa and Apple on technology to eliminate direct greenhouse gas emissions from the aluminum smelting process. Rio has already supplied aluminum to Nespresso, but is not its exclusive supplier. Nespresso said in an email it would take time for all capsules to be ASI-certified but it was working with its manufacturers to achieve this and on making recycling as easy as possible. Holder of nearly a third of the coffee pod market, Nespresso faces competition from other companies marketing themselves as sustainable. British coffee brand Halo said on Friday it had created “the world’s first fully home compostable paper-based coffee capsule and packaging,” which can break down in about a month."
14.904044361952604," Rio Tinto joins race for Teck's copper project stake: sources LONDON (Reuters) - Rio Tinto is among parties making a final offer for a minority stake in Teck Resources Ltd’s Quebrada Blanca copper mine expansion in northern Chile, a development worth $4.8 billion, two sources close to the matter said. The world’s second largest mining company is eager to boost its copper assets, with the metal viewed in the industry as having one of strongest outlooks. Existing reserves are dwindling and increased electrification means demand is likely to be strong. Canada's Teck TECKb.TOTECK.N has said a development partner could contribute $2 billion for a 30 percent to 40 percent stake in the copper project, an investment deal it expects to close in the fourth quarter. Rio Tinto declined to comment and Teck Resources did not respond to a request for comment. Final offers are also expected from Japanese trading houses Mitsubishi Corp 8058.T and Sumitomo Corp 8053.T, which are scouting for mining assets to buy with growing profit, driven by higher commodities prices, the sources said. Mitsubishi, which recently agreed to raise its stake in the Quellaveco copper project in Peru it shares with Anglo American Plc AAL.L, and Sumitomo were not immediately available to comment. China's state-owned Aluminum Corp of China (Chinalco) and Canadian base metals miner Lundin Mining Corp LUN.TO are also likely to put in offers, while the interest from Canada's Freeport [FCXFM.UL] waned, one of the sources said. There are not many copper assets currently available on the market and big mining companies, restored to health following the 2015-16 crash, are still seeking to rationalise their portfolios and only look for best quality mines. The world's biggest listed miner BHP BHP.AXBLT.L has managed to buy a stake in SolGold's SOLG.L promising copper-gold discovery in Ecuador, having earlier agreed to sell the Cerro Colorado mine in Chile to Australian private equity fund EMR Capital. Rio Tinto has agreed to sell its stake in Indonesia’s Grasberg, the world’s second biggest copper mine, as part of a series of complex deals drawn up in response to the country’s pursuit of greater control over its natural resources."

7.687327947720966," Zinc market tightness confounds bearish expectations: Andy Home LONDON (Reuters) - The refined zinc market looks super tight. London Metal Exchange zinc spreads are stressed, with the cash-to-three-months premium hitting a one-year high of $63 per ton earlier this week. LME stocks are low, at just 99,900 tonnes excluding metal earmarked for physical load-out. It’s the same story in Shanghai. Shanghai Futures Exchange (ShFE) zinc spreads are also in backwardation, while the premium for metal in bonded warehouses shot to multi-year highs in September. ShFE stocks have rebuilt slightly since the start of the month to 53,500 tonnes. But that’s still well short of the 160,000 tonnes that were there as recently as April. “Screamingly bullish” is how analysts at Citi described the Shanghai market earlier this month. (“Zinc’s screaming”, Oct. 5, 2018). Not the sort of headline you’d expect in a market that is weighed down by expectations of a looming supply surge. Feast, however, has been postponed, leaving the physical supply chain hungry for units. The International Lead and Zinc Study Group (ILZSG) made some interesting revisions to its supply-demand forecasts in its October assessment of the zinc market. The group increased its expected global supply deficit this year to 322,000 tonnes from the 263,000 tonnes forecast at its last meeting in April. Trying to predict a market balance for an industrial metal such as zinc is a hapless exercise, particularly given the statistical opacity of China, the largest single influence on the calculations. The deficit assessment is a function of many moveable inputs, some of them known, some of them “known unknowns”. The real takeaway is not the outright size of deficit but why the group has increased its shortfall estimate. This year’s expected mine production growth has been slashed to 2.0 percent from April’s forecast of 5.1 percent. China’s own mine output is now forecast to contract by 2.5 percent this year. In April the ILZSG expected it to rise by 2.3 percent. China’s usual “swing capacity”, the smaller operations that burst into life during periods of elevated pricing, has failed to swing this time around, even though the zinc price hit 11-year highs in the second quarter. Environmental crackdown seems the most plausible explanation for the change in Chinese supply dynamics. Outside of China, meanwhile, the wave of new mines is only starting to build. That supply will hit the market next year, when the ILZSG is forecasting global mine production to surge by 6.4 percent with refined output growth accelerating from 1.4 percent to 3.0 percent. Note, however, that the group is still expecting a small 72,000-tonne refined metal deficit next year, presumably allowing for the time it takes for higher mine output to travel down the production chain. The supply surge, in other words, has been pushed back to 2019. Physical tightness in the refined segment of the market, it seems, is not going to go away any time soon, either in Shanghai or in London. Graphic on Shanghai zinc stocks and physical premium: tmsnrt.rs/2O4v8M1 In early September the premium for zinc in Shanghai’s bonded warehouse zone nearly doubled to $300 per tonne over LME cash, according to Shanghai Metal Market. Visible stocks on the ShFE were depleted at under 30,000 tonnes both at the start and end of September. This squeeze on physical availability has coincided with a slide in China’s own refined zinc production. National output fell for a fourth straight month in September, the pace of decline quickening to 10 percent, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. The official figures always come with a statistical health warning but the trend of falling refined production tallies both with the ILZSG’s assessment of lower domestic mine supply and with Chinese producers’ stated intention to cut output in the face of compressed margins. The spike in the Shanghai premium may have included an element of panic buying ahead of the Golden Week national holiday but it’s noticeable that the premium has fallen only as far as $200, matching its previous high in 2017. It’s still signaling that China is short of zinc units. LME zinc stocks and cash-to-three-months spread: tmsnrt.rs/2Rew5Dp Those units will come from the rest of the world. Unfortunately, we don’t know how much because China hasn’t released detailed metals trade reports since March. And we don’t know how much there is to feed Chinese imports because most of the inventory in the rest of the world is sitting away from the statistical light in off-market storage. What we do know is that a significant part of that inventory is located in Antwerp and New Orleans, because those are the two LME locations that have seen large amounts of zinc placed on to LME warrant this year. Antwerp received 60,050 tonnes over a three-day period in April and another 19,100 tonnes on July 20. New Orleans has seen sporadic inflows totaling 182,975 tonnes this year. The appearance of so much zinc has played to the bear narrative. But in truth it is no more than a hall-of-mirrors interplay of LME spreads, LME warehouse economics and a good deal of warrant sifting as traders seek out saleable units from what might well be very old metal. Which is why what has “arrived” at both Antwerp and New Orleans hasn’t stuck around for long. The Belgian location is currently being cleared out after a mass cancellation last week. There are 31,275 tonnes of zinc awaiting physical load-out and just 200 tonnes of available stock. In New Orleans, despite the merry-go-round of zinc between on- and off-market storage, headline LME stocks are now down by 50,800 tonnes on the start of the year. Outside of these two locations, inflow into the LME storage system has been a minimal 6,275 tonnes since January. Most of it has already departed. Only two other locations now hold registered open tonnage - Rotterdam with 100 tonnes and Bilbao in Spain with 300 tonnes. Appearances can be deceptive when it comes to LME stocks but the underlying reality is that outside of rotational movement at Antwerp and particularly New Orleans, there doesn’t seem to be much metal available even at recent high cash premium levels. The ILZSG’s October forecasts tell us why that shouldn’t be a big surprise. Time-spreads in both London and Shanghai are a reality check on a bear narrative that had run ahead of itself."
1.29507379291924," METALS-Zinc surges as supply deficit erodes stockpiles * Zinc up 17 pct from 22-month low in August * Market in 322,000-tonne deficit -ILZSC * Rally could be short-lived - analyst (Updates with closing prices) LONDON, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Zinc prices rose on Tuesday towards last week’s three-month high as falling stockpiles underlined a global supply shortage. Benchmark zinc on the London Metal Exchange (LME) closed up 2.4 percent at $2,678 a tonne. The metal used to galvanise steel has surged by more than 17 percent from August’s 22-month low of $2,283 and is close to a $2,706.94 peak reached on Oct. 2. But the rally is likely to be short-lived, said Capital Economics analyst Caroline Bain. “The market does look a bit tighter currently, but over the next three months we see the supply picture improving,” she said, predicting prices at $2,300 at the end of next year. STOCKS: Zinc inventories in LME-registered warehouses fell below 200,000 tonnes from more than 250,000 tonnes in August and are nearing 10-year lows. MZNSTX-TOTAL Stockpiles in Shanghai Futures Exchange storehouses are at 29,204 tonnes, the lowest since 2007. ZN-STX-SGH SPREAD: The premium of cash zinc over the three-month contract rose to $41.50, reversing recent falls and signalling a lack of nearby supply. MZN0-3 TECHNICALS: Zinc was struggling to break above its 100-day moving average at $2,685. DEFICIT: Demand for refined zinc will exceed supply by 322,000 tonnes this year and 72,000 tonnes in 2019, the International Lead and Zinc Study Group (ILZSG) said on Monday. CHINA OUTPUT: Production cutbacks at China’s zinc smelters in response to tighter environmental checks and weaker profits have tightened supply, said CRU analyst Dina Yu in Beijing. China accounts for nearly half of global refined zinc production of about 13.5 million tonnes. It is also the largest consumer of the metal. OUTLOOK: A mixture of rising mine output, reduced pressure on polluting Chinese industry to close during the winter period and a weakening of Chinese economic growth is likely to ease the supply situation, said Capital Economics analyst Bain. CHINA GROWTH: The International Monetary Fund cut China’s 2019 growth forecast to 6.2 percent from 6.4 percent, leaving the 2018 forecast unchanged at 6.6 percent. Lower growth implies weaker demand for metals. It also reduced its global economic growth forecasts for 2018 and 2019 to 3.7 percent from 3.9 percent for both years. ALUMINIUM: LME aluminium ended 0.6 percent down at $2,055 a tonne, falling for a fourth day. A supply scare involving a Norsk Hydro alumina smelter in Brazil appeared resolved, while consultancy CRU said tax rebates in China, the largest aluminium producer, heralded a surge in exports from the country. OTHER METALS: Copper closed up 1.8 percent at $6,292, lead fell 1.8 percent to $1,936, tin did not trade but was bid 0.4 percent higher at $18,980 and nickel finished up 3.5 percent at $13,015."
-5.883492984212071," Freeport, Rio sell majority stake in Grasberg mine to Indonesia JAKARTA (Reuters) - Global mining giants Freeport McMoRan Inc and Rio Tinto have struck a binding accord to sell a majority stake in the world’s second-biggest copper mine, Grasberg, to Indonesia’s state mining company, Inalum for $3.85 billion. The sale brings Freeport close to ending more than nine years of often fractious negotiations with Indonesia over ownership rights to Grasberg. The agreement gives the parties six months to close the deal and process several permits including those related to antitrust laws in China. Inalum Chief Executive Budi Gunadi Sadikin said at a press conference his company would be ready to complete the transaction in November. Several matters must still be resolved before the share transfer, he said. “There are documents, administrative permits and there is the money,” Sadikin added. After the transfer Inalum will hold a 51.23 percent stake in PT Freeport Indonesia, which will then be issued with a special mining permit for Grasberg, ending its existing operating contract for the mine. Inalum has the option of financing the transaction using a combination of bank loans, bonds and internal cash reserves, Sadikin said, noting that the composition would depend on interest rates at the time of the deal. Freeport McMoRan Chief Executive Richard Adkerson told reporters the deal signed on Thursday is a “definitive sales and purchase agreement”, which he hoped would end controversy surrounding Freeport’s business in Indonesia. “This completes the negotiations and fixes and binds issues that were not dealt with,” he added. “Now the next step is to go to closing.” “We’ve responded to the government’s ambitions, so our hope is that this allows us to stabilize our operations,” Adkerson said. Rio holds a 40 percent participating interest in the Grasberg mine, which will be converted to an equity stake that will be transferred to Inalum, as part of the transactions. Freeport Indonesia Executive Vice President Tony Wenas earlier said he hoped the deal would be closed “this year.”"

-6.666661891902256," Rio Tinto announces new $3.2 billion share buyback, stock rises (Reuters) - Global miner Rio Tinto will return $3.2 billion to shareholders from its sale of Australian coal assets this year in addition to existing buyback programs, it said on Thursday. The news helped to drive Rio Tinto's London share price RIO.L nearly 2 percent higher by 0927 GMT and pushed up the Australian listing RIO.AX by 3.5 percent. Across the mining sector, a trend to hand money back to shareholders has gathered steam following a recovery from the mining and commodity crash of 2015-16 and pressure from investors not to waste growing piles of cash on buying up assets that may never deliver returns. In its latest move, Rio Tinto, which has already returned more money to shareholders than its peers, said it will conduct an off-market share buyback for up to 41.2 million shares in its Australian entity Rio Tinto Ltd, worth about $1.9 billion, and further on-market purchases of London’s Rio Tinto plc shares, bringing the total to $3.2 billion. Previous buybacks have favored the London arm of the dual-structured company but industry sources said it balanced out over time. Rio Tinto had already announced plans in August for a $4 billion buyback. “Returning $3.2 billion of coal disposal proceeds demonstrates our commitment to capital discipline and providing sector-leading shareholder returns,” Rio Tinto Chief Executive Jean-Sebastien Jacques said in a statement on Thursday. The funds come from the proceeds of Rio Tinto’s exit from coal. Early this year, it sold the Hail Creek coal mine and Valeria coal project to Glencore GLEN.L, Winchester South to Whitehaven Coal WHC.AX and the Kestrel coal mine to private equity manager EMR Capital and Indonesia's Adaro Energy Tbk ADRO.JK. In total, the assets raised $4.15 billion. Jason Teh, chief investment officer of Sydney-based Vertium Asset Management, said the buyback would be taken favorably by the market, adding that there could be more to come. “Because their balance sheet is in such a pristine state, every time they do an asset sale they are normally just returning proceeds back to shareholders,” he said. Jacques said the focus would remain on managing the company’s portfolio to get rid of assets that did not provide the best returns over time. Rio Tinto has agreed to sell copper assets in Indonesia to Freeport-McMoRan Inc FCX.N as part of a series of complex deals. It is unclear when that sale will be completed. Norsk Hydro NHY.OL and Rio announced last week they had dropped a plan for Hydro to buy Rio Tinto assets, including an aluminum plant in Iceland, after approval from European regulators took longer than expected. Rio’s sale of its Dunkirk aluminum smelter in northern France announced in January has also yet to be finalised.

-1.6227669081093434," Norway's Hydro drops plan to buy Rio Tinto assets (Reuters) - Norway’s Hydro said on Friday it had dropped plans to buy several of Rio Tinto’s assets, including an aluminum plant in Iceland, after approval from European Commission regulators took longer than anticipated. In February, Hydro made an offer to buy the aluminum plant, as well as a 53 percent stake in a Dutch anode facility Aluchemie and 50 percent of the shares in a Swedish aluminum fluoride plant Alufluor for about $345 million. “The European Commission competition approval process has taken longer than anticipated and remains outstanding,” Hydro said in a statement. “After considering alternative timelines, outcomes and developments, Hydro requested to terminate the transaction and the parties have signed a termination agreement,” it said. Hydro has withdrawn its EU competition filing, it added. Hydro, which is not interested in acquiring aluminum plants that use coal-fired power, was hoping the deal would be part of efforts to make its output as green as possible and bolster its position in Europe. Under the deal, Hydro would have been the sole owner of the Dutch factory, while the Swedish factory would have been 50/50 owned with fertilizer maker Yara International."

0.4568996675462138," RPT-Rio Tinto considers float of Canadian iron ore business-sources (Repeats to additional subscribers) LONDON, Aug 9 (Reuters) - Rio Tinto , the world’s second largest listed mining company, is exploring a public listing of its Iron Ore Company of Canada business, banking and industry sources said, as it focuses on boosting revenue from its flagship Australian assets. Iron ore, which accounts for most of Rio’s profit and is used in making steel, has provided healthy margins for years but the outlook is uncertain as major buyer China is expected increasingly to rely on recycling rather than importing raw material. Following a commodity price crash in 2015, Rio put a string of assets on the block, mostly in coal, to decrease its debt load. In iron ore, its push to refocus has meant concentrating on Australia’s Pilbara region, where it has lower costs and higher grades. IOC, 59 percent owned by the Anglo-Australian miner, 26 percent by Japan’s Mitsubishi Corporation and 15 percent by Labrador Iron Ore Royalty Company, is one of Canada’s largest producers of iron ore. It had revenues of $1.9 billion in 2017. Rio had tried to sell its stake in IOC in 2012 as it already deemed it a non-core asset but it withdrew the process, saying the sale was not essential. One banking source said that offers from private equity funds and rival miners had not met Rio’s target of between $3.5 billion and $4 billion back then. Rio was now considering an IPO of its stake on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) as part of its ongoing work to hold only its best assets, but the process was at an early stage and it had not yet hired a financial adviser, the banking source added. Rio Tinto and Mitsubishi declined to comment. Labrador Iron Ore Royalty Company was not immediately available to comment. Rio Tinto’s revenues are more dependent on iron ore than its rivals. In 2017, iron ore made up more than 60 percent of Rio’s earnings. The Pilbara region of Western Australia produces high quality iron ore that sells at a premium and Rio invested heavily in the region’s assets, installing driverless trains and maximising productivity. It is also poised to expand there, having approved $146 million of funding to undertake initial work at the Koodaideri iron ore project, ahead of a final investment decision expected by the end of the year. IOC produces iron ore pellets and concentrate from operations in Newfoundland and Labrador, and runs port facilities in Sept-Iles, Quebec, as well as a 418-kilometre railway that links the mine to the port. A labour dispute earlier this year that resulted in a two-month suspension of operations was part of the reason for Rio reducing its underlying core profit by $137 million compared with the 2017 first half, Rio Tinto said when it reported half-year results last week.

Rio is the No.2 shareholder in Escondida, the world’s biggest copper mine. Shares in BHP and Rio Tinto fell 1.4 percent and 0.8 percent respectively on Tuesday in the wake of the news. In the industrials sector, Amcor Ltd, the world’s biggest listed packaging company after announcing an all-stock deal worth about $5.25 billion to buy U.S.-listed Bemis Company Inc. The benchmark’s biggest loser, fleet management services provider Eclipx Group, slumped 40.8 percent after trimming its full-year profit outlook. Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank of Australia’s kept its cash rate at a record low of 1.5 percent on Tuesday. The central bank has notched up two whole years with no move in interest rates as optimism on the economy is tempered by miserly wage growth and muted inflation. Australia’s financial stocks ended 0.3 percent lower, mainly due to a 1 percent loss in Commonwealth Bank of Australia in the last session before its scheduled annual results. But the country’s energy stocks closed at their highest in over 3-1/2 years, rising in lock step with oil prices in the wake of worries over tighter supply when new U.S. sanctions on Iran are expected to kick in from November.

The benchmark edged down slightly on Wednesday. “It is turning out today is quite a bad day for our materials players,” said Christopher Conway, head of research and trading at Australian Stock Report. Shares of BHP, already down earlier because of lower commodity prices, were further impacted as workers at its Escondida mine in Chile, the world’s biggest copper mine, voted to strike. For the day, the stock fell 3.3 percent. Meanwhile, shares of Rio Tinto had their worst day in over four months, falling 4.9 percent after reporting first-half underlying earnings below market expectations. Concerns about higher inflation and reliance on iron ore for the bulk of its profits further dented confidence, and contributed to Rio’s shares dropping to a more than three-month low. The miner’s London-listed shares also dropped on Wednesday, despite the company earmarking an additional $1 billion to buy back London-listed stock.

Rio’s London-listed shares dropped by about the same after the news on Wednesday, despite the company earmarking an additional $1 billion to buy back London-listed stock. Investors had been upbeat about a strong showing by Rio ahead of the miner’s results and the start of the reporting season down under, which had sent its shares higher. Christopher Conway, head of research and trading at Australian Stock Report, said Rio’s earnings and worries about the escalating trade war and tariffs have impacted commodities. “It’s a broad sector obviously but the Rio results is having a negative impact. So as it is turning out, today is quite a bad day for our materials players,” Conway said. Copper, iron ore, base metals and other materials, all slid on Wednesday tracking a potential hit to demand on account on trade war worries, with the metals and mining sub-index down 1.7 percent. A day ago, the U.S. administration threatened tariffs of 25 percent instead of 10 percent on $200 billion worth of imported Chinese goods.

-3.2482196783928385," Rio Tinto falls as profit miss highlights cost concerns MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Global miner Rio Tinto said on Wednesday its first-half profit grew 12 percent, missing estimates and sending its shares lower even though it earmarked an additional $1 billion to buy back London-listed stock. Rio Tinto emerged from the commodity market crash of 2015-16 with the strongest balance sheet among major miners, but concerns about rising inflation and reliance on iron ore for the bulk of its profits are denting confidence in its shares. Underlying earnings for the six months to June 30 grew to $4.42 billion as higher iron ore output overcame lower prices. That was below forecasts of $4.53 billion, according to estimates in an independent survey of 15 analysts. By 1209 GMT, Rio’s shares in London were 3.5 percent lower and helped push the broader mining sector down 2.8 percent. Outgoing Chief Financial Officer Chris Lynch said old alumina contracts cost the company “a couple of hundred million” dollars as it missed out on exposure to big price gains in alumina - a raw material used to make aluminum - after the United States imposed sanctions on Russia’s Rusal in April. Inflation, however, was a concern, Lynch said as oil prices have climbed over the past year, driving up fuel costs for miners, and the cost of hiring contractors has also risen amid higher demand. Frances Hudson, an investment director at Aberdeen Standard, which holds Rio Tinto shares, said rising oil prices and mostly weakening metals prices meant the “profit picture is less favorable from both sides” for a miner like Rio. Rio’s high exposure to iron ore was also unhelpful “in a context where Chinese growth is softening”, she said. Bankers and analysts increasingly say Rio needs to buy assets to diversify its portfolio. Rio declared a half-year dividend of $1.27 a share, equivalent to $2.2 billion, up 15 percent from a year ago. The increase in funds for share buybacks follows asset sales worth $5 billion announced this year that have left the world’s No. 2 iron ore miner with a cash pile in excess of the $5.5 billion outlined for planned capital expenditure in 2018. RBC Capital Markets last week downgraded Rio’s stock to “underperform” and reiterated the rating on Wednesday, saying it expected the company’s exposure to iron ore to “cause significant compression of profitability”. Analysts and miners favor copper’s long-term demand prospects. Rio Tinto is striving to develop a massive underground copper mine extension in Mongolia, but geopolitical risk there is an ongoing concern. Rio is seen as all the more dependent on the Mongolian mine after it outlined this month the terms of the sale of its 40 percent stake in Grasberg, the world’s second biggest copper mine, to an Indonesian government-owned holding firm for $3.5 billion."

-8.962739209464191," RPT-COLUMN-BHP, Rio deals show lack of options beyond shareholder returns: Russell (Repeats with no changes to text) LAUNCESTON, Australia, July 31 (Reuters) - Two recent deals by the world’s two biggest mining companies both looked positive for shareholders, but also underscore the challenges facing major commodity producers. BHP Billiton last week agreed to sell its U.S. shale oil and gas assets for $10.5 billion, while Rio Tinto appears on track to exit its troubled investment in the giant Grasberg copper and gold mine in Indonesia for about $3.5 billion. Both deals were generally well-received by investors, largely because they resolve long-running sores for the mining giants and will likely result in a return of the proceeds to shareholders. BHP Chief Executive Andrew Mackenzie has said the proceeds of the sale of the U.S. shale assets will be returned to shareholders, but hasn’t yet given details of how and when. Rio Tinto has been cautious over the announced agreement to sell its Indonesian unit to the state-owned miner PT Inalum, which would effectively mean selling its 40 percent interest in Grasberg, which is operated by Freeport-McMoRan Inc. However, the chances are good that at least some of the proceeds, should the deal be finalised, will wind up in the hands of shareholders. While investors are usually pleased to get their hands on a pile of cash, the fact that BHP intends to hand over the cash and Rio Tinto may do the same illustrates that there really are very few suitable investment opportunities. Mining companies were heavily criticised for over-investing in the last boom period, which ended in 2011 and was followed by five years of declining prices for most major commodities, such as iron ore and coal. This resulted in the companies turning their focus to operational efficiencies and boosting returns to shareholders, a shift that is still the current mantra most often heard from top mining executives. But while this was a necessary change in mindset, it is also a strategy that’s unlikely to work in the long term. BHP retains offshore crude oil assets in the United States, and its interest in liquefied natural gas in Australia. But the sale of the shale oil and gas assets, mainly to BP Plc, is an effective retreat from a business that has transformed the global energy landscape. Exiting shale also came at a substantial overall price for BHP, given the assets cost about $20 billion when purchased in 2011 and have been written down in value several times since then. Handing the money back to shareholders through boosted dividends or a share buyback will provide investors with a sugar hit, but do little to enhance the long-term value of BHP. BHP’s biggest division is its Western Australia iron ore, and the company remains heavily exposed to the fortunes of the Chinese steel sector, the buyer of two-thirds of the world’s seaborne iron ore supplies. Rio Tinto is even more exposed to iron ore, with its operations in Western Australia accounting for about 70 percent of its earnings. Both BHP and Rio Tinto have struggled to diversify away from iron ore, and both have made costly and unsuccessful acquisitions in the past 20 years. BHP’s massive Olympic Dam copper, gold and uranium mine in South Australia has had problems ramping up production, while similar issues have impacted Rio Tinto’s Oyu Tolgoi copper mine in Mongolia. These assets are good enough to be worth investing time, money and effort to get them working efficiently, but the difficulties both companies have encountered show there are probably no easy major projects left in the world. This poses the question: What next for BHP, Rio Tinto and other major miners such as Anglo American and Brazil’s Vale ? They run the risk of being companies that can return cash to shareholders in the good times, but will lag when commodity prices go through the inevitable cyclical downturns. While it would be foolish to advocate the companies jumping headlong into new mining areas such as battery metals like lithium and cobalt, it’s likely that eventually investors will demand more from the top resource companies.

Both deals were generally well-received by investors, largely because they resolve long-running sores for the mining giants and will likely result in a return of the proceeds to shareholders. BHP Chief Executive Andrew Mackenzie has said the proceeds of the sale of the U.S. shale assets will be returned to shareholders, but hasn’t yet given details of how and when. Rio Tinto has been cautious over the announced agreement to sell its Indonesian unit to the state-owned miner PT Inalum, which would effectively mean selling its 40 percent interest in Grasberg, which is operated by Freeport-McMoRan Inc. However, the chances are good that at least some of the proceeds, should the deal be finalised, will wind up in the hands of shareholders. While investors are usually pleased to get their hands on a pile of cash, the fact that BHP intends to hand over the cash and Rio Tinto may do the same illustrates that there really are very few suitable investment opportunities. Mining companies were heavily criticised for over-investing in the last boom period, which ended in 2011 and was followed by five years of declining prices for most major commodities, such as iron ore and coal. This resulted in the companies turning their focus to operational efficiencies and boosting returns to shareholders, a shift that is still the current mantra most often heard from top mining executives. But while this was a necessary change in mindset, it is also a strategy that’s unlikely to work in the long term. BHP retains offshore crude oil assets in the United States, and its interest in liquefied natural gas in Australia. But the sale of the shale oil and gas assets, mainly to BP Plc, is an effective retreat from a business that has transformed the global energy landscape. Exiting shale also came at a substantial overall price for BHP, given the assets cost about $20 billion when purchased in 2011 and have been written down in value several times since then. Handing the money back to shareholders through boosted dividends or a share buyback will provide investors with a sugar hit, but do little to enhance the long-term value of BHP. BHP’s biggest division is its Western Australia iron ore, and the company remains heavily exposed to the fortunes of the Chinese steel sector, the buyer of two-thirds of the world’s seaborne iron ore supplies. Rio Tinto is even more exposed to iron ore, with its operations in Western Australia accounting for about 70 percent of its earnings. Both BHP and Rio Tinto have struggled to diversify away from iron ore, and both have made costly and unsuccessful acquisitions in the past 20 years. BHP’s massive Olympic Dam copper, gold and uranium mine in South Australia has had problems ramping up production, while similar issues have impacted Rio Tinto’s Oyu Tolgoi copper mine in Mongolia. These assets are good enough to be worth investing time, money and effort to get them working efficiently, but the difficulties both companies have encountered show there are probably no easy major projects left in the world. This poses the question: What next for BHP, Rio Tinto and other major miners such as Anglo American and Brazil’s Vale ? They run the risk of being companies that can return cash to shareholders in the good times, but will lag when commodity prices go through the inevitable cyclical downturns. While it would be foolish to advocate the companies jumping headlong into new mining areas such as battery metals like lithium and cobalt, it’s likely that eventually investors will demand more from the top resource companies.

-8.65051973252636," Guinea's mining minister says there will be Simandou deal, talks go on LONDON (Reuters) - Guinea is in constant talks with Rio Tinto and Chinalco to finalize a deal on selling two blocks of the vast Simandou iron ore project, its mining minister said, adding he was confident an agreement would be reached. Rio Tinto in October 2016 said it had signed an outline agreement to sell its major stake in Simandou to Chinalco, a move many hoped would revive the long-stalled scheme. Mines Minister Abdoulaye Magassouba said he was confident a deal would be achieved. He gave no indication of how much more time was needed, but said that as soon as the parties had agreed, the project would be relaunched. “We are working with Rio Tinto, with Chinalco to finalize the definitive accords, but it’s normal for so big a project that things can take a bit longer than expected,” he said in an interview. As talks have dragged on, one complication was Chinalco wanting to take over the whole of the project not just the two blocks Rio is selling, sources told Reuters. Magassouba ruled that out. “It’s Simandou South, blocks 3 and 4, that’s the object of our discussions. It’s very clear,” he said. Rio Tinto had the rights to all of Simandou until 2008, when then-President Lansana Conte stripped it of the northern half, which is still the subject of legal wrangling. A Rio spokesman had no comment, but the company’s CEO has said in the past that talks were ongoing when asked about the delay in completion. Chinalco did not respond to requests for comment. Billions of tonnes of some of the world’s highest grade iron ore lie under the remote forested hills of Simandou, but to transport it to Guinea’s coast would cost $23 billion in infrastructure upgrades, according to government estimates. The minister was speaking in London late on Tuesday after two days of talks to meet potential investors in Guinean mining and beyond. As well as iron ore, Guinea holds some of the world’s richest bauxite, some of which is being developed by sanctions-hit Russian aluminum producer Rusal. Last month Rusal said it had started shipping bauxite from its Dian-Dian bauxite project in Guinea and days later restarted production at its Friguia alumina refinery, also in Guinea. “We are confident the situation will improve, the situation will thaw,” Magassouba said when asked whether sanctions could disrupt operations. Rusal shareholders elected a new board of directors last month in an effort to appease the United States and get the restrictions lifted."
-5.2415544727759205," Rio Tinto posts jump in iron ore output, flags stronger 2018 MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Global miner Rio Tinto said on Tuesday that its second-quarter iron ore shipments from Australia rose 14 percent and indicated its annual production would be at the upper end of its guidance. The miner said it expected iron ore shipments for the year to be at the upper end of its range of 330 million to 340 million tonnes, driven by productivity improvements and fewer weather-related disruptions compared with the same quarter last year. It had said earlier it did not expect tensions over a global trade war to materially affect steel demand. Each of the four big iron ore miners are expected to log record production in the second quarter, given a ramp up in China’s steel demand in the quarter, Shipbroker Clarksons Platou Securities said. “Volumes were generally held back a bit in 1Q18, as the Chinese steel complex was weaker (due to) winter production cuts, Chinese New Year, National People’s Congress. As Chinese steel output increased to record levels in 2Q18, iron ore volumes picked up, as well,” it said in a report. Rio’s Australian iron ore shipments totaled 88.5 million tonnes in the quarter ended June 30, compared with 77.7 million tonnes a year ago, the company said in a statement. UBS had expected iron ore shipments to rise 14 percent for the quarter. Iron ore prices were flat over the quarter. Rio Tinto said its mined copper production jumped by 26 percent due to higher grades at Kennecott and a labor union strike at Escondida that impaired production in the first half of last year. Negotiations are underway for a new contract at Escondida after the current one expires on August 1. The company recently confirmed the sale of its 40 percent stake in the world’s second-biggest copper mine, Grasberg, for $3.5 billion to Indonesia’s state mining company PT Inalum and said that it did not expect to record any share of copper production from it this year. Rio also flagged “significant raw material costs headwinds” to its aluminum business given its exposure to soaring alumina prices, which it expected to continue into the second half. Alumina prices have surged following the partial shutdown of the world’s biggest plant, Alunorte in Brazil, outside China, as well as rising input costs. While Rio said in April it was in the process of calling force majeure on contracts that had been impacted by U.S. sanctions on Russian companies, it has not done so so far given the wind-down period for sanctions-hit business was extended until Oct. 23."

-6.038478985990649," Rio Tinto's minerals sands operation in South Africa shut by protests JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - A mineral sands operation on the South African coast run by Rio Tinto has been closed since Friday due to violent community protests which saw a security guard killed earlier this week, the company and a union said on Wednesday. Community unrest is a common feature of South Africa’s social landscape, which is marred by high jobless rates and glaring income disparities, underscoring the social risks for investors in the country’s mining sector. “Due to the escalation in activity around the blockades on the access roads, staff were sent home on Friday. Our highest priority is the safety of our people,” a Rio spokesman said. The operation, Richards Bay Minerals, is on South Africa’s Indian Ocean coast. Mzi Zakwe, the regional secretary for the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), told Reuters the union’s 900 members were on forced leave because of the violence, which he said was rooted in grievances between the company and contractors. Unrest has hit the area before, which is also near South Africa’s main coal terminal. Elsewhere in South Africa, the eastern limb of the platinum belt was hit by more than 400 incidents of social unrest impacting mining operations since between the start of 2016 and April this year according to data compiled by Anglo American Platinum and reviewed by Reuters."

-2.755168740136593," Rio Tinto ready to splash out on copper (This version of June 29’s story has been refiled to clarify Kevin Fox was speaking at a mining conference in May.) LONDON (Reuters) - Rio Tinto wants copper, and it’s ready to pay top-dollar. The global miner would be willing to fork out a large premium over market value to secure a prime asset as it tries to reduce its reliance on iron ore, company and banking sources told Reuters. If it can’t land a big copper project, it is weighing the cumulative power of a series of more modest acquisitions to increase its exposure to a metal expected to be in high demand from the electric vehicle and renewable energy industries, the sources said. “Growth is back on the agenda,” Jean-Sebastien Jacques told a mining dinner in London late on Thursday, but he said Rio would be selective. Kevin Fox, managing director of Rio Tinto Ventures, a division set up to hunt for relatively small mining projects, told a mining conference in May it was tough to find quality assets. “The exploration space is not full of wonderful opportunities,” he said. “What are we looking at? It’s trite to say the battery minerals sector is attracting a lot of interest and we are obviously looking at that. We include in that copper.” He declined to say how much Rio would pay or to specify any projects. More than a year after the division was set up, it has yet to make an acquisition. Banking sources say pressure is mounting for a copper deal. One banker with knowledge of the matter said for high-quality assets, where there are large deposits of high-grade copper, Rio Tinto would be ready to pay a premium of 30-40 percent over any target’s stock market value or, if unlisted, over the value of the project’s copper reserves. The banker declined to be named as the matter is confidential. Companies that hold prime copper projects can be worth from $1 billion to $10 billion, depending on the size of their reserves, analysts say. Iron ore, which accounts for most of Rio’s profit, has provided healthy margins for years but the outlook is uncertain as major buyer China is expected increasingly to rely on recycling rather than importing fresh ore. Copper, by contrast, is regarded as a futureproof metal because of its widespread industrial use. Among bigger options for Rio Tinto is Canada’s First Quantum Minerals, according to the banking sources. The $10 billion miner’s copper assets account for around 80 percent of its revenue. Vancouver-based Nevsun Resources could also prove attractive, said bankers and analysts. Nevsun rejected a $1.16 billion joint offer from Lundin Mining and Euro Sun Mining Inc in May. Quantum Minerals and Nevsun did not respond to requests for comment. Rio Tinto could also look to increase its 51 percent stake in Mongolia’s giant Oyu Tolgoi mine, the bankers said. It would much prefer to increase its 30 percent stake in Chile’s Escondida, the world’s biggest copper mine which is operated by BHP, the sources added, though the chances of a deal are remote. The risks are that Rio will repeat the mistakes of the past. It was hit hard in the commodity price crash earlier this decade because of acquisitions in the preceding years and has had to work hard to rebuild its balance sheet and regain shareholder confidence. The most costly deal saw it entangled in a bidding war for Canada’s Alcan in 2007. It paid $38 billion - a third more than the closest rival bid - before writing down most of the asset’s value six years later. CEO Jacques, appointed in 2016, said he would be careful with shareholders’ money. “We are not under pressure to grow for the sake of it,” he said on Thursday. Compared with BHP - its closest rival and the world’s biggest listed miner - Rio Tinto has a heavier reliance on iron ore and lags on copper. BHP derives 44 percent of its core profit from iron ore, against Rio’s 60 percent, and has more than twice as much copper output. Rio does not break out its copper profits separately, but its copper and diamonds division generated about 10 percent of its core profit. BHP’s copper accounted for around 17 percent. Rio Tinto’s shares have outperformed BHP’s for more than a year, but bankers and analysts say the differences in their portfolios could cost Rio investors in coming years.

Other major listed rivals like Anglo American and Glencore have more diverse portfolios than Rio; Glencore supplies more than 90 commodities, while Anglo American mines coal, platinum, iron ore, copper and diamonds. Industry sources and analysts say the appointment of a new chief financial officer at Rio cements the authority of CEO Jacques. “This change will now usher in the J-S Jacques era in full, coinciding with a time when questions on strategic direction ... are beginning to grow,” said Tyler Broda, strategist at RBC Capital Markets. However Frances Hudson, an investment director at Aberdeen Standard, which holds Rio Tinto shares, said the CEO faced a delicate balancing act. “Investors are just as likely to criticize or punish companies for unfocused acquisitions where they have overpaid for unproven, non-earnings accretive benefits,” she said."

-17.865360582066586," Rio Tinto hires CFO from Danish shipper Maersk (Reuters) - Major miner Rio Tinto RIO.LRIO.AX named Jacob Stausholm, formerly CFO of Danish shipping company A.P. Moller-Maersk, to replace outgoing financial boss Chris Lynch when he retires in September, the Anglo-Australian mining company said on Tuesday. Lynch’s retirement was announced last September, triggering a search for a replacement to maintain the financial strength of a company with the strongest balance sheet of the major miners. Stausholm stepped down as CFO at Moller-Maersk in March after the company decided to separate the finance role from its IT and digital transformation function. His former boss said he had been one of the drivers of the Danish company’s strategic transformation from a broader conglomerate including an oil business to a more focused shipping company. From 2008 to 2011 Stausholm, 49, was CFO of facility services provider ISS A/S ISS.CO. Before that, he worked in the oil industry with jobs at Statoil, Woodside Petroleum and Royal Dutch Shell. Rio CEO Jean-Sebastien Jacques said in a statement that Lynch left Rio Tinto a stronger company than when he began in 2013. Commodity markets crashed in 2015-16, dragging down mining companies, and have since recovered, with Rio Tinto standing out for its shareholder returns.”Chris has helped embed a disciplined focus on costs and capital allocation,” Jacques said in a statement. Rio Chairman Simon Thompson said Stausholm’s experience would enrich Rio Tinto’s board discussions and ensure the continued focus on “disciplined capital allocation and the pursuit of superior shareholder value”. Analysts are unanimous that Rio Tinto has a very strong balance sheet, but some bankers say the company is under increasing pressure to buy assets and diversify its portfolio after a series of sales and a mounting pile of cash. Following Tuesday’s announcement, Rio Tinto shares were down 0.5 percent at 4,397 pence on the London Stock Exchange."
-20.47288038892355," Rio Tinto inks exploration agreement with China's Minmetals (Reuters) - Global miner Rio Tinto inked a joint venture agreement with China Minmetals Corp on Thursday, as the companies look to explore mineral deposits in China. The 50-50 joint venture with state-owned Minmetals follows a technical agreement signed in November when both parties committed to a collaborative partnership in mineral exploration. Major miners have been seeking ways to maximize exploration budgets and have also been analyzing the sustainability of their portfolios in light of the changing needs of China, the world’s biggest commodity consumer, as its economy matures. “The formalization of the exploration joint venture is an important milestone in our growing partnership with China and Minmetals, who is an increasingly important player in the global mining industry,” said Rio Tinto chief executive J-S Jacques. The registered capital of the venture will be $31.3 million, with initial contributions of $5.5 million by each of the companies within six months of establishment of the venture, Rio Tinto said. “The immediate priority for the joint venture will be mineral targets in China,” the company said, adding the future collaboration of the parties would expand to exploration of global resources. Rio Tinto, the world’s second-biggest listed miner by market capitalization, and No. 1 BHP, are particularly dependent on iron ore, as a bulk commodity with high profit margins. Minmetals, one of China’s biggest metals firms, mostly produces copper, zinc and nickel, but also holds reserves of steelmaking raw material iron ore."

-17.27080952778261," How Rusal escaped the noose of U.S. sanctions LONDON/PARIS/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - They were supposed to be the toughest sanctions the United States had ever imposed on a Russian oligarch. Seventeen days later, Washington watered them down. On April 23, the U.S. Treasury eased restrictions on billionaire Oleg Deripaska's aluminum company Rusal 0486.HK. Instead of barring Rusal from international markets, which is what the United States originally intended to do, the Treasury suggested it might lift the sanctions altogether. Washington’s change of course says a lot about the leverage held by the supply chain of a widely-used commodity such as aluminum. It also suggests the Trump administration is hard-pressed as it juggles international economic battles it has opened on various fronts, including with China and Iran. Several European governments, including Germany and France, lobbied Washington to back down, according to more than a dozen U.S. and EU officials and industry sources who spoke to Reuters. Multinationals Rio Tinto and Boeing also appealed to the U.S. Treasury, seeking a softening of the terms on Rusal. All made the same argument, the sources said: a squeeze on the largest producer of aluminum outside China would hit businesses around the world, disrupting production of myriad goods from car and planes to cans and foil, and putting jobs at risk. Rusal and Rio Tinto declined to comment. A spokesman for Boeing denied on Wednesday that the company had lobbied the U.S. Treasury on the matter, saying: “Boeing did not lobby the Treasury Department on Rusal.” Unlike previous cases of sanctions on Russia, European countries did not have a chance to consult with Washington on punitive moves that would have ripple effects in the European economy, the sources said. One reason for the lack of dialogue: the U.S. State Department no longer has a Sanctions Policy Coordinator to liaise with other governments, according to three U.S. sources familiar with the matter and one European source. The former coordinator, Daniel Fried, retired last year and has not been replaced because of a hiring freeze ordered by the Trump administration at the department. The U.S. Treasury, whose Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) imposed the measures, said it worked to mitigate the sanctions’ impact on allies and industries that faced “undesired collateral consequences”. It did not comment on lobbying efforts. When asked if the lack of a sanctions coordinator had hindered international consultation, the State Department said it had held several discussions with European countries over the past year about sanctions and maintained a dialogue with them. It did not specify if it had discussed Russian sanctions. The sanctions were the toughest the United States has imposed on a listed Russian company since Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Crimea. The notice on April 6 gave buyers a deadline of 30 days to receive supplies from Rusal before dealings in dollars were prohibited. Any individual or company that failed to comply would themselves face being shut out of the financial system, while the Treasury could seize any dollars paid to Rusal. The effect was immediate. Prices for aluminum surged 15 percent as Rusal stopped supplying customers. As well as producing aluminum, the company produces alumina, a raw material needed to make aluminum. “They (the Treasury) destabilized the global aluminum industry. This is unprecedented and a massive over-reach,” said Anders Aslund, senior fellow at U.S. think-tank Atlantic Council. Rusal told metals and mining conglomerate Rio Tinto that it was suspending deliveries of alumina from its Irish plant in Aughinish to Rio’s Dunkirk aluminum smelter in France, Europe’s biggest aluminum production facility, according to the industry sources. The Russian company feared any payment it received would be seized by U.S. authorities, the sources said. Rusal also informed Trimet Aluminium it was halting alumina deliveries to the German firm’s smelter in the French Alps and three factories in Germany, in Essen, Hamburg and Voerde. Trimet declined to comment. The suspension of alumina deliveries risked halting Rio Tinto and Trimet’s aluminum smelting operations and hitting businesses throughout the metal’s supply chain. The market ructions set off a different kind of activity. In the days following the sanctions notice, French, German, Irish and Italian officials lobbied against the restrictions, according to the EU sources. Many were worried the measures could lead to the closure of those plants and businesses in their countries that relied on Rusal supplies, and the potential loss of thousands of jobs. Ireland’s foreign ministry complained to U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin after Dublin officials met Aughinish management on April 13 and were told the plant could shut down, threatening hundreds of jobs, an Irish government spokesman told Reuters. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire discussed the issue by phone with Mnuchin in the days following the sanctions notice and then in person in the week of April 16, during International Monetary Fund meetings in Washington, according to a French finance ministry official. “We got in touch with the Americans as soon as it became clear there was an impact on some companies operating in France,” the official said. He added that hundreds of jobs were at risk in France. “The Americans were constructive from the start.” An Italian government source said Rome also lobbied Washington to soften the sanctions. Companies lobbied too. Rio Tinto contacted the French government and Trimet went to the German government, asking them to intervene with Washington, according to the industry sources. Rio Tinto also complained directly to OFAC, said two U.S. officials familiar with the developments. Trimet makes aluminum products for the auto, construction and packaging industries. While most of the lobbying came from Europe, according to U.S. officials, there were also concerns in the United States about the sanctions. After the April 6 notice, planemaker Boeing expressed concern to the U.S. government about rising aluminum prices, according to two industry sources familiar with the matter. Carmakers also complained about the possible impact of the sanctions on their businesses, said the sources, who declined to name the companies. One of the sources said that, in addition to aluminum, carmakers were worried about a possible disruption to supplies of palladium, used in catalytic converters. Rusal doesn’t produce palladium but it supplies soda to Norilsk Nickel, the world’s biggest palladium producer. American trade body the Aluminum Association told Reuters that, shortly after April 6, it shared market data with the Trump administration showing that last year the U.S. industry imported 680,000 metric tons of Russian primary aluminum, or 12 percent of U.S. demand. The association raised concerns about the Rusal sanctions at meetings with the White House’s National Economic Council and the U.S. Trade Representative. It said the measures could constrain supplies for aluminum processors. On April 23, little more than two weeks after imposing sanctions, OFAC softened the measures. It gave businesses six months instead of 30 days to wind down dealings with Rusal and said it might lift the sanctions altogether if Deripaska ceded control of the company.     The announcement had an immediate market reaction, with aluminum prices falling as much as 10 percent. Aluminium prices CMAL3 now stand at $2,300 per ton, down from the $2,700 level they rose to following the April 6 sanctions notice, but still above the $2,000 seen before the measures were imposed. David Mortlock, who designed earlier sanctions against Russia when he was Director for International Economic Affairs at the White House National Security Council in 2013-15, said such measures were not a precise science. “Don’t forget, sanctions can be adjusted if the impact is larger than OFAC wants,” added Mortlock, now a partner at legal firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher. “Every time you do it, you learn from your experience.”"
-17.27080952778261," Rio Tinto CEO calls for 'United Nations of the mining world' (In May 15 story corrects to read Peru in paragraph 12.) LONDON (Reuters) - Rio Tinto RIO.LRIO.AX CEO Jean-Sebastien Jacques said resource companies needed to build ""the United Nations of the mining industry"" to tackle rising resource nationalism and cost inflation. Rising commodity prices typically lead to resource nationalism as they inspire resource-holding nations to demand higher shares of international mining companies’ profits. At the same time, the miners say increased energy prices and wage demands are driving cost-inflation and eroding profit margins. They also say their profits required years of investment throughout the commodities cycle and their projects provide jobs and tax revenues for host nations. Asked at a conference hosted by BAML in Miami, whether forming partnerships was the answer, Jacques said “absolutely”. He said it had previously been the industry model, but the commodities supercycle of sustained high prices at the start of this century had made miners “greedy”. “Partnerships were seen as value leakage, not as risk mitigation,” he said. “Going forward, we need to spread the risk. In some very challenging jurisdictions, we will have to build the United Nations of the mining industry.” As one example, he cited Oyu Tolgoi in Mongolia, where Rio Tinto is the operator of a giant underground extension to a copper mine that has the backing of 15 commercial banks as well as money from the international financial institutions, such as the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Even with such protection, tensions have risen between Rio and the Mongolian government over issues such as tax and a power contract. nL8N1Q460M] Asked whether resource nationalism was a threat, Jacques said it was a reality. “From the Democratic Republic of Congo and South Africa to Mongolia and Australia ... It (resource nationalism) is gaining momentum,” he said in a speech to the Miami conference that was webcast. He added that foreign direct investment was under threat as a result and that “industry margins will come under pressure” from cost inflation. At the same conference, Anglo American AAL.L said it was looking at bringing in new parties to develop its copper project at Quellaveco in Peru on which its board is expected to take a development decision over the coming weeks. Anglo American has said it does not wish to develop greenfield projects alone and is talking with potential partners on Quellaveco, including existing Japanese partner Mitsubishi, which may acquire a bigger stake. 8058.T “We, like everyone else, have learnt some lessons,” CEO Mark Cutifani said, with reference to miners’ excess spending during the commodity boom. “Hence our desire to syndicate this project.”"
-17.27080952778261," INSIGHT-How Rusal escaped the noose of U.S. sanctions (Repeats story published at midnight) * Sanctions caused market turmoil, hit supply chains * Ireland, France, Germany lobbied to soften measures * Rio Tinto, U.S. aluminium body appealed to authorities * U.S. Treasury eased Rusal restrictions after 17 days By Dmitry Zhdannikov, Richard Lough and Lesley Wroughton LONDON/PARIS/WASHINGTON, May 16 (Reuters) - They were supposed to be the toughest sanctions the United States had ever imposed on a Russian oligarch. Seventeen days later, Washington watered them down. On April 23, the U.S. Treasury eased restrictions on billionaire Oleg Deripaska’s aluminium company Rusal. Instead of barring Rusal from international markets, which is what the United States originally intended to do, the Treasury suggested it might lift the sanctions altogether. Washington’s change of course says a lot about the leverage held by the supply chain of a widely-used commodity such as aluminium. It also suggests the Trump administration is hard-pressed as it juggles international economic battles it has opened on various fronts, including with China and Iran. Several European governments, including Germany and France, lobbied Washington to back down, according to more than a dozen U.S. and EU officials and industry sources who spoke to Reuters. Multinationals Rio Tinto and Boeing also appealed to the U.S. Treasury, seeking a softening of the terms on Rusal. All made the same argument, the sources said: a squeeze on the largest producer of aluminium outside China would hit businesses around the world, disrupting production of myriad goods from car and planes to cans and foil, and putting jobs at risk. Unlike previous cases of sanctions on Russia, European countries did not have a chance to consult with Washington on punitive moves that would have ripple effects in the European economy, the sources said. One reason for the lack of dialogue: the U.S. State Department no longer has a Sanctions Policy Coordinator to liaise with other governments, according to three U.S. sources familiar with the matter and one European source. The former coordinator, Daniel Fried, retired last year and has not been replaced because of a hiring freeze ordered by the Trump administration at the department. Rusal, Rio Tinto and Boeing declined to comment. The U.S. Treasury, whose Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) imposed the measures, said it worked to mitigate the sanctions’ impact on allies and industries that faced “undesired collateral consequences”. It did not comment on lobbying efforts. When asked if the lack of a sanctions coordinator had hindered international consultation, the State Department said it had held several discussions with European countries over the past year about sanctions and maintained a dialogue with them. It did not specify if it had discussed Russian sanctions. The sanctions were the toughest the United States has imposed on a listed Russian company since Moscow’s 2014 annexation of Crimea. The notice on April 6 gave buyers a deadline of 30 days to receive supplies from Rusal before dealings in dollars were prohibited. Any individual or company that failed to comply would themselves face being shut out of the financial system, while the Treasury could seize any dollars paid to Rusal. The effect was immediate. Prices for aluminium surged 15 percent as Rusal stopped supplying customers. As well as producing aluminium, the company produces alumina, a raw material needed to make aluminium. “They (the Treasury) destabilised the global aluminium industry. This is unprecedented and a massive over-reach,” said Anders Aslund, senior fellow at U.S. think-tank Atlantic Council. Rusal told metals and mining conglomerate Rio Tinto that it was suspending deliveries of alumina from its Irish plant in Aughinish to Rio’s Dunkirk aluminium smelter in France, Europe’s biggest aluminium production facility, according to the industry sources. The Russian company feared any payment it received would be seized by U.S. authorities, the sources said. Rusal also informed Trimet Aluminium it was halting alumina deliveries to the German firm’s smelter in the French Alps and three factories in Germany, in Essen, Hamburg and Voerde. Trimet declined to comment. The suspension of alumina deliveries risked halting Rio Tinto and Trimet’s aluminium smelting operations and hitting businesses throughout the metal’s supply chain. The market ructions set off a different kind of activity. In the days following the sanctions notice, French, German, Irish and Italian officials lobbied against the restrictions, according to the EU sources. Many were worried the measures could lead to the closure of those plants and businesses in their countries that relied on Rusal supplies, and the potential loss of thousands of jobs. Ireland’s foreign ministry complained to U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin after Dublin officials met Aughinish management on April 13 and were told the plant could shut down, threatening hundreds of jobs, an Irish government spokesman told Reuters. French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire discussed the issue by phone with Mnuchin in the days following the sanctions notice and then in person in the week of April 16, during International Monetary Fund meetings in Washington, according to a French finance ministry official. “We got in touch with the Americans as soon as it became clear there was an impact on some companies operating in France,” the official said. He added that hundreds of jobs were at risk in France. “The Americans were constructive from the start.” An Italian government source said Rome also lobbied Washington to soften the sanctions. Companies lobbied too. Rio Tinto contacted the French government and Trimet went to the German government, asking them to intervene with Washington, according to the industry sources. Rio Tinto also complained directly to OFAC, said two U.S. officials familiar with the developments. Trimet makes aluminium products for the auto, construction and packaging industries. While most of the lobbying came from Europe, according to U.S. officials, there were also concerns in the United States about the sanctions. After the April 6 notice, planemaker Boeing expressed concern to the U.S. government about rising aluminium prices, according to two industry sources familiar with the matter. Carmakers also complained about the possible impact of the sanctions on their businesses, said the sources, who declined to name the companies. One of the sources said that, in addition to aluminium, carmakers were worried about a possible disruption to supplies of palladium, used in catalytic converters. Rusal doesn’t produce palladium but it supplies soda to Norilsk Nickel, the world’s biggest palladium producer. American trade body the Aluminum Association told Reuters that, shortly after April 6, it shared market data with the Trump administration showing that last year the U.S. industry imported 680,000 metric tons of Russian primary aluminium, or 12 percent of U.S. demand. The association raised concerns about the Rusal sanctions at meetings with the White House’s National Economic Council and the U.S. Trade Representative. It said the measures could constrain supplies for aluminium processors. On April 23, little more than two weeks after imposing sanctions, OFAC softened the measures. It gave businesses six months instead of 30 days to wind down dealings with Rusal and said it might lift the sanctions altogether if Deripaska ceded control of the company. The announcement had an immediate market reaction, with aluminium prices falling as much as 10 percent. Aluminium prices now stand at $2,300 per tonne, down from the $2,700 level they rose to following the April 6 sanctions notice, but still above the $2,000 seen before the measures were imposed. David Mortlock, who designed earlier sanctions against Russia when he was Director for International Economic Affairs at the White House National Security Council in 2013-15, said such measures were not a precise science. “Don’t forget, sanctions can be adjusted if the impact is larger than OFAC wants,” added Mortlock, now a partner at legal firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher. “Every time you do it, you learn from your experience.” (Additional reporting by Yara Bayoumy, Mary Milliken, Warren Strobel, Mike Stone and Timothy Gardner in Washington; Polina Devitt, Anastasia Lyrchikova, Dasha Korsunskaya and Katya Golubkova in Moscow; Giselda Vagnoni in Rome; Conor Humphries in Dublin; Clara Denina and Dasha Afanasieva in London; Madeline Chambers in Berlin; Edward Taylor in Frankfurt; Michael Hogan in Hamburg; Writing by Dmitry Zhdannikov; Editing by Pravin Char)"

-5.76154239685687," U.S. sanctions extension may ease Rusal restrictions: Rio Tinto CEO MELBOURNE (Reuters) - An amendment by the U.S. Treasury to its Russian sanctions program may greatly reduce the restrictions on aluminum giant Rusal, Rio Tinto Chief Executive Jean Sebastien Jacques said on Wednesday. Washington last month imposed sanctions on Russian billionaire Oleg Deripaska and several companies in which he is a large shareholder, including En+ Group Plc and aluminum giant United Company Rusal Plc, in response to what the United States called Russia’s “malign activities.” Late on Tuesday, the U.S. Treasury gave investors an additional month to divest or transfer their holdings in sanctions targets, including Rusal and En+. “We are still digesting (the announcement) ... which means that potentially the restriction on Rusal may have been reduced in a dramatic way,” Jacques said in Melbourne after the miner’s annual general meeting. “We are reviewing the situation, but today we can see a way forward. We’ll come back to the market as and when the situation is clear,” he told a media briefing. The United States has said previously it would consider lifting sanctions if Deripaska, who holds a 48 percent stake in Rusal through his 65 percent holding in En+, ceded control of the company. Deripaska agreed last week to cut his shareholdings in En+ to less than 50 percent and resign from the board. Under the latest U.S. Treasury amendment, the deadline to divest financial holdings in sanctions targets would be extended to June 6 from May 7. The sanctions have upended the global aluminum industry. Rio Tinto, which buys from and sells to Rusal and jointly owns an alumina refinery in Australia, said last month it would declare force majeure on some contracts, a legal term that allows a firm not to deliver on contacts due to circumstances outside its control. “It does just underline the unintended consequences of trade sanctions,” Rio Tinto Chairman Simon Thompson said at the briefing. “This was directed at Oleg Deripaska .. In fact it has had major repercussions across the whole market because the aluminum industry is integrated by international trade.”"
-1.4112936290629678," Australia corporate watchdog expands legal action against Rio Tinto, former executives SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's corporate watchdog said on Tuesday it has expanded legal action against miner Rio Tinto RIO.AXRIO.L and two former top executives, alleging a failure to recognize an impairment in its Mozambique coal assets in 2012 financial statements. The new allegations against former Chief Executive Tom Albanese and former Chief Financial Officer Guy Elliott come on top of claims the executives misled investors about the coal reserves in the 2011 annual report. “The charges are wholly unwarranted and Rio Tinto intends to vigorously defend itself and is confident that ASIC’s allegations will be rejected once all the facts are considered in court,” a Rio Tinto spokesman said. The global miner has denied any wrongdoing in a similar case brought by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Rio Tinto bought Riversdale Mining, later renamed Rio Tinto Coal Mozambique, for $4 billion in 2011, but later wrote off about $3.5 billion of its value."
-3.3597024804525173," Prices for aluminum raw material alumina surge after Rio Tinto force majeure MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Prices of alumina, the raw material for making aluminum, have surged after Rio Tinto said it could not fulfil supply contracts because of U.S. sanctions on United Company Rusal, adding to a crunch rippling through the aluminum supply chain. Rio said it was in the process of declaring force majeure on Friday for certain customer contracts that likely include alumina shipments from a refinery it operates with Rusal in Australia, bauxite shipments to a Rusal alumina refinery in Ireland, as well as alumina from that refinery to smelters in Europe. Force majeure is a legal term describing situations when a contract cannot be fulfilled because of forces beyond a company’s control. Alumina is a compound extracted from bauxite ore that is then smelted to form aluminum. COMEX alumina futures for delivery in May jumped 15 percent on Friday following the Rio curtailment. The futures are up 22 percent since April 6 when the United States imposed the sanctions on Rusal as part of broader sanctions against Russian companies and owners in response to allegations of Russian government interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Prices for spot physical cargoes of alumina from Australia are $550 per ton, said two traders that participate in the market on Wednesday, but that was likely to rise. The Rio announcement and the Rusal sanctions add to global alumina supply constraints after Norsk Hydro’s Alunorte, operator of the world’s biggest alumina refinery, was ordered to shut half of its output amid an investigation into allegations the site contaminated local water supplies. Alunorte and Rusal, the world’s second-biggest aluminum producer, account for 11 percent of global alumina production. Internally, Rio Tinto’s Dunkirk smelter in France, which buys alumina from Rusal’s refinery in Ireland, has only three weeks of alumina stockpiles, Johan Vlietinck, an official with France’s CGT union at Aluminium Dunkerque told Reuters. The company is searching for alternative supplies, he said. The disruption to the supply chain and the higher alumina prices will spill over to semi-manufactured aluminum and ultimately hit manufacturers of products such as beer cans, cars and construction materials. “This is going to be domino effect all over the place,” said Paul Adkins, Managing Director of consultancy AZ Aluminium in China. “It’s just a total supply equation -- there’s not enough to go around. That’s going to have a knock on effect downstream.” It takes around 2 tonnes of alumina to make 1 ton of aluminum. Global aluminum prices rose to their highest since September 2011 on Wednesday, climbing to as much as $2,445 per ton. “Phones have been ringing off the hook with people looking for extra metal,” said a source at a smelter in Asia. “They are looking for any extra tonnes, even just a few hundred.”"
-3.3597024804525173," Rio Tinto flags changes to 2018 aluminum output after U.S. sanctions MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Global miner Rio Tinto on Wednesday flagged possible changes to its 2018 aluminum output following U.S. sanctions on its Russian partner Rusal earlier this month. Rio, which reported a 5 percent rise in first-quarter iron ore shipments in the March quarter, has declared force majeure on some customer contracts after U.S. sanctions on UC Rusal, the world’s second biggest aluminum producer. Rio kept its forecast for aluminum production steady in its first quarter production report. “Adjustments may ... be made as a consequence of the U.S. sanctions,” it said. Rio has said it is reviewing Rusal’s 20 percent stake in its Queensland Alumina refinery, Rusal’s supply and offtake arrangements, bauxite sales to Rusal’s refinery in Ireland and offtake contracts for alumina. The miner could still be a big beneficiary of the U.S. sanctions on Rusal as it is a major supplier of aluminum to the United States from its Canadian smelters, while aluminum prices have surged by more than 20 percent since the sanctions were announced. Rio said its 2018 aluminum output forecast of 3.5 to 3.7 million tonnes would also face adjustments following the sale of its Icelandic and French aluminum smelters. In iron ore, the world’s second-biggest supplier of the steel-making ingredient, shipped 80.3 million tonnes in the quarter ended March 31, up from 76.7 million tonnes last year. Rio said March shipments rose due to fewer weather disruptions and productivity improvements, although shipments fell 11 percent on the previous quarter. “We delivered a solid operational performance across most commodities in the first quarter of 2018,” Rio Tinto Chief Executive Jean-Sebastien Jacques said in a statement. “Our world-class Pilbara iron ore assets continue to demonstrate flexibility and the benefits of increased productivity, and production at our bauxite and copper assets was also higher.” The miner maintained its iron ore production guidance for this year of 330 million to 340 million tonnes, and kept its copper guidance steady. For the March quarter, aluminum production fell 5 percent from a year ago to 846,000 tonnes, while copper output jumped 65 percent to 139,300 tonnes. The global miner exited the coal mining business in the March quarter with the sale of its stake in the Kestrel mine in Central Queensland. Rio’s Australian shares rose 1.6 percent in morning trading, outpacing a 0.3 percent rise in the broader market. (This story has been refiled to correct the spelling of “force” in second paragraph)"
