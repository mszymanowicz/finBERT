22.00572939795247," New chip to let headphones respond to Amazon's Alexa by name (Reuters) - Knowles Corp, a major supplier of microphones to Apple’s iPhone and many other smart devices, on Tuesday released a new chip that will allow battery-powered wireless headphones to respond to Amazon’s Alexa voice assistant by saying the assistant’s name. Previously, users of most Alexa-enabled headphones have had to press a button on the side of the headphones to awaken the assistant. Consumers have become accustomed to calling out names for popular voice assistants, such as Amazon.com Inc’s Alexa, Apple Inc’s Siri or Google Inc’s Google Assistant. But in order to detect the wake word, these so-called smart home devices must use electricity to keep a microphone and what is known as a digital signal processor running at all times to listen for the assistant’s name. That has made it difficult to engineer voice activation into small devices such as wireless earbuds with limited battery life. Apple’s $160 AirPods wireless earbuds made their debut in 2016, but the company did not introduce the ability to wake its voice assistant by saying “Hey, Siri” until March, when the second generation of the device was released. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd in April introduced a limited set of voice commands for its Galaxy Buds and its Bixby voice assistant. Headphones using Google’s Assistant still do not have the capability. Knowles has designed a power-efficient chip that integrates a microphone and digital signal processor, along with a so-called reference design that will let third-party headphone makers easily place the Alexa assistant into their products. “It turned out to be a little more complicated than we thought, but we did it,” Mike Polacek, president of the intelligent audio business unit at Knowles, told Reuters in an interview. Knowles said that electronics makers Anker and LinkPlay plan to use the chips and Alexa design to bring voice-activated versions - as opposed to push-button versions - of Alexa to their headphones. Bose Corp plans to release headphones later this month with voice-activated Alexa, but Knowles declined to comment on whether Bose is using its chip. In a statement, Priya Abani, director of Amazon’s Alexa Voice Service unit, said the Knowles designs are intended to “help developers save time and money building new devices for Alexa.”"
2.406256160813876," Knowles hires JPMorgan for activist defense: source (Reuters) - Audio components maker Knowles Corp has hired JPMorgan investment bankers to advise it on its defense against demands by shareholders Caligan Partners LP and Falcon Edge Capital LP to seek a review of its Precision Devices unit, according to a source familiar with discussions between the parties. The source also said the two funds, which together hold more than 6.7 percent of Knowles and are seeking to nominate two new members to its board, are still prepared to work cooperatively with the company on solutions. Shares in Knowles have risen about 3 percent since Caligan and Falcon went public with their demands at the end of last week, after settlement talks between the shareholders and the company stalled. JPMorgan’s involvement in the conflict was first reported earlier on Thursday by Dealreporter. The source said the funds were unwilling to agree to demands by Knowles that the funds enter a two-year stand-still agreement in return for a single board seat. After an overwhelming vote in favor of de-staggering the company’s board at its last annual meeting, six of Knowles’ board members will be up for re-election at a 2020 shareholders’ meeting. A two-year standstill agreement would require the activists to vote in favor of all board proposals till 2021. While Caligan and Falcon were open to settling for one seat instead of two, the stand-still demand, described as ""off-market"" in the funds' letter here dated March 29, was a dealbreaker, the source said. Caligan and Falcon Edge also posted a presentation (bit.ly/2YNXqka) on Wednesday, demanding the company release detailed financials for its struggling Intelligent Audio segment. The funds said they believe Knowles’ stock could reach at least $28 per share in value by the end of the year if the company listened to their feedback. JPMorgan, Caligan Partners, Falcon Edge and Knowles Corp declined to comment. (This story corrects headline to remove reference to legal counsel.)"
