-10.736677870021751," Carlyle Group signs lease at One Vanderbilt in New York NEW YORK (Reuters) - SL Green Realty Corp SLG.N, a major New York landlord, said on Tuesday that The Carlyle Group LP signed a 15-year lease for three floors at One Vanderbilt, a marquee office tower that is part of a bevy of new buildings redefining the city's skyline. Carlyle CG.O, a global asset manager which on Monday said it raised $18.5 billion for its largest buyout fund ever, agreed to take floors 36-38 in the 1,401-foot skyscraper rising next to Grand Central Terminal in Midtown Manhattan. All of Carlyle’s roughly 300 personnel at nearby 520 Madison Avenue will move to One Vanderbilt, a company spokeswoman said. The tower designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates is now 37 percent leased and has risen 34 stories, five weeks ahead of its planned completion in the third quarter of 2020, SL Green said. The building occupies an entire block and its column-free floors will provide unobstructed 360-degree views of New York. One Vanderbilt, along with new construction downtown at the World Trade Center and in the Hudson Yards district on the West Side, is pushing the skyline higher and adding much-needed office space as Manhattan enjoys its biggest boom in decades. JLL represented Carlyle and CBRE the landlord in the lease."
-2.128051317239077," China's HNA to sell stake in 245 Park Avenue to SL Green: WSJ NEW YORK (Reuters) - SL Green Realty Corp. SLG.N is buying a stake in the office tower at 245 Park Avenue in New York City from embattled Chinese conglomerate HNA Group [HNAIRC.UL], according to the Wall Street Journal. HNA has been seeking to sell assets after overstretching itself through a debt-fueled buying spree in 2016 and 2017 that included purchasing 245 Park Avenue for $2.21 billion last year, at a price described at the time as one of the highest ever paid for a commercial skyscraper in Manhattan. The WSJ report published late on Saturday did not give details of the deal, but cited one source familiar with the matter as saying SL Green would have “operating control of the property and a preferred position in the joint venture”. Spokespeople for SL Green and HNA Group did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Reuters. HNA is restructuring its operations and selling assets to raise cash, partly to repay debt. Since the start of 2018, it has agreed to sell real estate worth more than $10 billion in Australia, New York and Hong Kong, along with shares in Deutsche Bank AG DBKGn.DE and Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc HLT.N."

5.702538557840864," SL Green signs law firm to One Vanderbilt tower in New York NEW YORK, April 25 (Reuters) - SL Green Realty Corp, a major New York landlord, said on Wednesday law firm McDermott Will & Emery LLP signed a 20-year lease at One Vanderbilt, a 1,401-foot (427-meter) office tower going up next to Grand Central Terminal in Midtown Manhattan. McDermott agreed to take 105,539 square feet of space on floors 44-46 and 67 in the $3.1 billion tower, whose planned opening in 2020 will herald the rejuvenation of the East Midtown office district, where buildings on average are 85 years old. One Vanderbilt is now 31 percent leased and on track to meet SL Green’s goal of being 37 percent leased by year end, the real estate investment trust (REIT) said in a statement. The tower, a column-free structure with extra-high ceilings and unobstructed glass siding, occupies an entire city block immediately west of Grand Central, a key transportation hub in the city that is adding a new train line from Long Island. One Vanderbilt will have direct connections to the transit network and SL Green is funding $220 million of infrastructure upgrades to the system. City officials last August approved the rezoning of a 78-block swath surrounding Grand Central that will allow for new construction and higher office towers in exchange for funding improved access to the Manhattan’s aging subway system."
