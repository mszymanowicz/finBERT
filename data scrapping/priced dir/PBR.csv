Petrobras declined to comment on Thursday evening. Petrobras has been raising fuel prices since a Reuters report on Feb. 5 disclosed details of the company’s price policy, which led analysts to downgrade the company’ shares on concerns of possible political interference. Bolsonaro did not further specify what measures will be taken in the coming days at Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the firm is formally known. “I can’t and wouldn’t interfere at Petrobras - even if something will happen at Petrobras in the coming days,” the president said. “Something needs to change. It will happen.” In late January, Castello Branco said during a webinar that truckers threatening to strike due to what they perceived as high domestic diesel prices were not the company’s problem. “As the head of Petrobras said a few days ago: ‘I don’t have anything to do with truckers.’ That’s what he said, the head of Petrobras. That’s going to have a consequence obviously,” Bolsonaro said during the live chat. Petrobras has repeatedly said it sells fuels domestically in line with international prices. But investors have been jittery about possible political interference since the oil producer confirmed Petrobras would allow domestic prices to differ from international prices for longer periods of time than previously disclosed. Reuters reported on Feb. 5 that Petrobras is calculating the international price parity of the fuels it sells over a period of one year. It was the first time the period used internally by Petrobras to close the books on price fluctuations has been made public since 2019, when the calculation was done monthly. Analysts at UBS calculated in a note to clients that the hike announced by the company on Thursday morning represented a 10% increase in gasoline prices and a 15% increase in diesel. Political interference with Petrobras’ fuel pricing policy has long been a concern for the market. In 2018, Petrobras’ then-chief executive resigned when Brasilia stepped in to artificially lower fuel prices in response to a crippling nationwide truckers’ strike."

-8.431684027734661," Exclusive: Talos, Enauta consortium places bid for Petrobras Albacora fields, sources say RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - A consortium of Talos Energy Inc, private equity firm EIG Global Energy Partners, Enauta Participacoes SA and 3R Petroleum Oleo e Gas SA has submitted a non-binding offer for Brazilian oilfields Albacora and Albacora Leste, five sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. The exact value of the bid submitted to Brazil’s state-led oil company Petrobras was unclear, though the asset is likely to fetch in the billions of dollars, said two of the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss confidential talks. The bid was officially submitted on Monday, one source said. The two fields produce 77,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day according to tender documents released by Petrobras. The state-run oil firm is seeking to rapidly de-leverage by selling non-core assets. Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the producer is formally known, has sold dozens of small and medium-sized fields over the last two years. The Albacora divestment would be the largest since 2017, when the company agreed to sell a stake in its Roncador field to Norway’s Equinor ASA for $2.9 billion. If the bid is successful, it would mark a significant geographic shift for Talos, which is active only in the Gulf of Mexico. In recent years, Talos has attempted to negotiate a so-called unitization agreement with Mexican national oil company Pemex over the offshore Zama discovery, which the Houston-based company announced in 2017. Pemex claims most of the nearly 700-million-barrel find is in its adjacent field, and talks have been an enduring headache for Talos. A source familiar with the firm’s strategy described the Albacora offer as consistent with Talos’ push for adding offshore scale and diversity to its portfolio. Both Washington-based EIG and Brazil’s Enauta have previously said they were looking to use cash firepower from recent divestments to make acquisitions in Brazil, including production assets. Petrobras, EIG, Enauta and 3R declined to comment. Talos did not respond to requests for comment. There are likely other bidders for the oilfields, two of the sources said. Among the companies that have publicly expressed interest in Albacora and Albacora Leste is Rio de Janeiro-based independent Petro Rio SA, which did not respond to a request for comment. Aker BP ASA, which is currently active only in Norway, had examined the asset, but ultimately decided against bidding, the company’s chief executive told Reuters last week. New York-listed shares in Talos and Sao Paulo-listed shares in 3R both rose 3% at opening on Wednesday before paring most gains. Enauta shares were up 0.56% in mid-day trade, and Petrobras shares were roughly flat. Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa equities index was down 1%. During the next step of the sale process, likely several weeks away, interested parties will submit binding offers."

-11.53449705947301," Petrobras fuel pricing policy sparks fresh investor concerns RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Shares in Brazil’s Petrobras fell on Monday amid concerns from some investors and analysts about potential political interference in the state-controlled oil company’s domestic fuel pricing policy. On Friday, the company’s chief executive, Roberto Castello Branco, met with Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro to talk about Brazil’s fuel prices, which the president had said he considered high. Both Petrobras and Bolsonaro reiterated before and after the meeting that the company was operating free of political influence. Later on Friday, Reuters reported that Petrobras had adopted a policy allowing domestic fuel prices to fluctuate above and below international parity for longer periods of time than previously disclosed. The company confirmed the information. That development sharply trimmed session gains of up to 3.5% for Petrobras shares, which closed the day just slightly higher. On Sunday, in a second statement, Petrobras further confirmed the Reuters report, saying the policy that allows price fluctuations over a period of one year, compared to the previous three-month period, would be applied in 2021. On Monday, the shares opened off more than 2%, at one pointing leading losses on Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa equities index. Preferred shares were down 1.8% in midday trading. Both Bradesco and XP downgraded their recommendation on the stock from ‘buy’ to ‘neutral’ on Monday, saying doubts about Petrobras pricing had increased. Analysts at Morgan Stanley called recent events pertaining to Petrobras pricing “more noise than substance,” adding that future price hikes should quell market jitters. On Monday, Petrobras sharply hiked diesel and gasoline prices. That followed its statement on Sunday reiterating that its fuel prices are determined only by the company and are in line with international import prices. Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the company is formally known, did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday. Also on Monday, Petrobras divulged that it had agreed to sell its RLAM refinery to Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Investment Co for $1.65 billion but would restart the sale process for its REPAR refinery in the southern state of Parana, as it considered the current bids too low."

Petrobras, as the company is known, also said it would not sell its REPAR refinery, in the southern state of Parana, at the current time as it considered the bids too low. It did not elaborate further but said, without giving a timeline, that it will begin a new sales process for REPAR. Reuters reported earlier that both Ultrapar Participacoes SA and Raizen, a joint venture between Royal Dutch Shell PLC and Brazilian ethanol producer Cosan SA, had bid for REPAR. According to antitrust rules, as Petrobras picked Ultrapar to lead negotiations for the sale of its REFAP refinery in Rio Grande do Sul state, in the same region as REPAR, its only option would be to sell REPAR to another competitor, in this case Raizen. Petrobras said the process to divest REFAP, as well as five other refineries, namely RMAN, RNEST, REGAP, LUBNOR and SIX, was ongoing."
-18.85642148592216," UPDATE 1-Petrobras shares up as Bolsonaro vows not to meddle with fuel pricing (Adds share performance, analyst comments) SAO PAULO, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro said on Friday he won’t interfere with pricing policy set by Petrobras, sending shares of the state-controlled oil company up nearly 3%, but would instead seek to reduce prices via tax changes. Bolsonaro’s comments were a relief to investors, who had feared a return to costly government interference in Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the company is formally known. Between 2011 and 2015, Petrobras was forced to sell fuel at a loss in an attempt to prop up the economy, costing the company billions of dollars. Bolsonaro said he intended to present a bill to Brazil’s congress next week that would aim to change the way state fuel taxes are levied to increase their predictability by pegging them at or near refinery prices. The government is also studying ways to reduce a federal tax on fuel, but at the moment it doesn’t have a way to compensate for the resulting decrease in tax revenue. The cost of fuel has become a hot political issue in Brazil again as truckers threaten to strike over the rising prices. Regis Cardoso, analyst at Credit Suisse, said in a note that the news was positive as “it lowers political risks” around the company. Preferred shares of Petrobras rose 2.7% to 29.59 reais in mid-morning trading.

In a statement to Reuters, Petrobras said it had suspended the sale of aviation gasoline on February 1 after the company identified the product was not meeting one of the required standards. Petrobras added the product was within standards in January, but identified changes later in the supply chain, and clients that acquired the product were immediately notified.

-18.96932807513072," UPDATE 2-Brazil's Petrobras redirects sales to domestic market in fourth quarter (Adds information on January exports, scheduled stoppages) RIO DE JANEIRO, Feb 2 (Reuters) - Brazilian state-run oil company Petrobras sharply reduced crude exports in the fourth quarter in order to accommodate relatively strong domestic demand, according to quarterly production figures released on Tuesday. In a securities filing, Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the company is formally known, said crude exports in the fourth quarter came to 618,000 barrels per day, down 16.6% from the previous quarter and 4.5% from the same period the year before. The same trend appeared with various fuels that Petrobras produces, with total domestic sales volume rising 3% from the third quarter and total foreign sales volume falling 14.7%. Domestic sales of fuel oil jumped 54.5% from the previous quarter, thanks in large part to greater demand from power plants, the company said. In comments accompanying the quarterly figures, Petrobras acknowledged its turn toward the domestic market in the fourth quarter, but said exports were still high by historical standards and would continue to be a key element of the company’s business strategy. It said crude exports were strong in January, reaching an all-time record at its Angra dos Reis terminal near Rio de Janeiro of 19.3 million barrels exported. In the filing, Petrobras said it produced 2.682 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in the quarter. That represented a decrease of 9.1% from the third quarter and 11.3% from the same quarter a year before. Petrobras had already released its year-long 2020 production figures, as well as production figures for the first three quarters of the year. The company attributed the quarter-over-quarter decrease largely to scheduled stoppages at platforms in prolific fields, which were not possible during previous quarters due to the coronavirus pandemic."

For the first time since the COVID-19 pandemic stalled the sale process, Petrobras has agreed on a target stock price range for the sale of its 37.5% stake, worth 10.3 billion reais ($1.9 billion), considering its current market price. The share sale by Petrobras, as the producer is known, would effectively end government participation over the fuel distributor, which would become a corporation with no major controlling stake holder. A share sale around 25 reais apiece has not been ruled out, said two of the people, who requested anonymity because the sale discussions are confidential. While executives have agreed on a range at which they would sell, no hard target has been set. Petrobras and BR Distribuidora declined to comment. BR Distribuidora stocks recently peaked at 24.33 reais, in a 16.4% intraday rise on Jan. 26, after the board announced Wilson Ferreira Jr. would take the chief executive post at Latin America’s largest gas station chain after leaving as CEO of state-run power company Eletrobras. Petrobras’ move to unload its BR stake is part of a wider government effort to have the oil company focus on deep-water production and open Brazil’s oil-related markets to private players - from fuels, to natural gas and fertilizing plants. Petrobras Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco said last week during a webinar that he was awaiting an improvement in price conditions to resume the share sale process, which stalled early during the COVID-19 pandemic. BR shares hit a year high of 29.93 in February 2020 before losing about half their value the next month. This would be the third major share sale by Petrobras of BR Distribuidora, which was fully state controlled until three years ago. Shares were sold at 15 reais apiece in its initial public offering, in December 2017, when Petrobras sold a 29% stake. BR was effectively privatized in 2019 through a follow-on operation, with shares sold at 24.50 reais.

The statement, which followed a report earlier in the day in online newspaper Brazil Journal, gave no details on timing or price. The Brazil Journal article said Eneva competitor 3R Petroleum Oleo e Gas SA had made a higher offer during a bidding round in 2020, but that round was scuttled after Petrobras determined the terms attached to the 3R bid were unacceptable. Eneva was victorious in a fresh bidding round, Brazil Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. While it did not cite a specific price, Eneva’s new offer was 30% to 40% higher than its previous bid for the asset, which was $600 million, the paper reported. The two companies will now negotiate the terms of the potential sale contract, which could take months, the article added. A representative for Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as Brazil’s state-run oil company is formally known, declined to elaborate on the securities filing. Eneva did not respond to a request for comment. Common shares in Eneva closed up 13.51% on Monday while shares in Petrobras gained 3.15%. Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa equities index closed up 2.13%."

Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the company is formally known, has already launched a process to find a possible replacement for Marcelo Zenkner, a former prosecutor who took the job in July 2019, said one of the sources, who like the others requested anonymity to discuss confidential matters. Zenkner said he did not want to renew his contract, which expires at the end of March, for personal reasons, the people said. Petrobras typically confirms contract renewals for its executive board at an annual shareholders meeting around April. His departure has not been made official. Petrobras declined to comment. Zenkner did not respond to requests for comment on social media, and the company did not make him available for an interview. Petrobras has made significant strides in its anti-corruption programs after becoming the focus of Brazil’s largest graft investigation ever, known commonly as “Car Wash,” in 2014. The company created a compliance department from scratch, among other measures, after the multi-billion-dollar bribes-for-contract racket led to the indictments of dozens of high-ranking businessmen and politicians throughout Latin America. But the compliance seat has turned over faster than other positions on the executive board. João Elek Jr., the company’s compliance chief from January 2015 until April 2018, said in a series of interviews in 2019 that Petrobras managers frequently put up roadblocks to internal investigations, which the company denied. His successor, Rafael Gomes, stepped down amid disagreements with members of the executive board regarding corporate governance and compliance-related issues, said two sources with knowledge of the matter. Among the issues of contention was a decision pushed by Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco to end participation in a good governance certification program set up by the Sao Paulo stock exchange, they said. Petrobras declined to comment on the circumstances of the departure of Gomes. Zenkner’s pending exit comes amid a busy week for executive moves at state-controlled companies in Brazil. On Monday, the chief executive of Brazilian state power company Eletrobras and the head of the downstream unit at Petrobras both announced plans to step down."

CEO Roberto Castello Branco also criticized the quality of the country’s roads, which imposes high costs for truckers. “This is not Petrobras’ problem,” Branco said during a webinar organized by an investment bank, adding that his company sells fuels in accordance with international prices. Brazilian truckers are threatening a nationwide strike on Feb. 1 amid a rise in fuel and other costs. Castello Branco, without specifying, said there are groups pressuring politicians to demand intervention to lower the price of diesel. Petrobras is pricing fuels above its import costs and is not loosing money, he said. But Castello Branco said it will not bring the volatility of the international market to local prices by making regular price adjustments. Former CEO Pedro Parente resigned in 2018 after a national trucker strike, with drivers discontent with the company’s policy then of adjusting prices daily. Petrobras investors have a trauma of government intervention in fuel prices after the producer lost around $40 billion between 2011 and 2014 for subsidizing fuels as part of a government plan to control inflation. The company is trying to sell half of its refining capacity and negotiations for five of eight units on the block are in final stages, he said. Refineries can erode investors’ money as they are a less profitable business than other investments, the CEO said. (Reporting by Sabrina Valle and Marta Nogueira; Editing by Dan Grebler)"

Offers are due on Monday, Feb. 1. Samsung and Petrobras declined to comment. Daewoo and Hyundai did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The competition marks Petrobras' comeback as a key customer for Asian shipyards. Similarly sized units have previously cost around $1.7 billion each to build, one of the sources said. Petrobras, as Petroleo Brasileiro SA is known, requires units each able to produce 180,000 barrels of oil per day and 7.2 cubic meters of gas for its massive Buzios field, the second most productive in the country. The platforms are effectively massive ships with deep-water production equipment that are vital in some offshore oil basins. They are known as FPSOs, or floating production, storage and offloading units. The debate on where Petrobras should build its platforms has been a key issue in presidential campaigns over the past two decades in Brazil. Construction of the hull is labor-intensive, leading past administrations to create domestic-content rules. Those were eased after a corruption scandal, although the exact percentage of local content will only be known once a winner is selected. Brazil's biggest-ever corruption investigation - known as Car Wash - exposed multi billion-dollar bribe payments from Petrobras suppliers aimed at securing contracts, including for platform construction in Brazil and in Asia. Buried in debt, Petrobras spent more than seven years only leasing its platforms, using long-term contracts that can be amortized over 20 years.

-13.679842065500122," EXCLUSIVE-Samsung, Hyundai, Daewoo prepare for Petrobras oil platform tender - sources Three consortia including Asian shipyards are preparing to compete to build Brazilian state-controlled oil firm Petrobras' (PETR4.SA) first two in-house platforms in more than seven years, according to four people familiar with the tender. Samsung Heavy Industries Co (010140.KS), Daewoo Heavy Industries & Machinery Ltd, and Hyundai Heavy Industries Holding Co Ltd (267250.KS) have formed separate consortia that are expected to bid after seven months of preparations, the sources said, declining to be named as the information is private. Offers are due on Monday, Feb. 1. Samsung and Petrobras declined to comment. Daewoo and Hyundai did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The competition marks Petrobras' comeback as a key customer for Asian shipyards. Similarly sized units have previously cost around $1.7 billion each to build, one of the sources said. Petrobras, as Petroleo Brasileiro SA is known, requires units each able to produce 180,000 barrels of oil per day and 7.2 cubic meters of gas for its massive Buzios field, the second most productive in the country. The platforms are effectively massive ships with deep-water production equipment that are vital in some offshore oil basins. They are known as FPSOs, or floating production, storage and offloading units.

With a 15-year career at Petrobras, Silva takes the job amid a process of divestment of eight refineries, which correspond to about half of Brazil’s fuel production capacity. The departure of Lara, who was leading the company’s efforts to sell off its refineries, came the same day the chief executive of state-run power firm Eletrobras resigned, saying he had lost faith that the privatization drive would receive the necessary political backing. Their exits led some analysts to question whether the government of President Jair Bolsonaro remains committed to keeping state-run companies free of political interference, a promise that helped get Bolsonaro elected in 2018. It also raised doubts about the commitment to sell off billions of dollars’ worth of assets at fair prices. Political interference by past administrations in both Petrobras and Eletrobras led the companies to register multibillion-dollar writedowns for bad investment decisions and corruption, leading to Brazil’s largest graft investigation ever, known as Carwash. Bolsonaro won office with a pledge to kick-start Brazil’s economy but the coronavirus pandemic has derailed growth and is draining his popularity after generous state handouts to fight poverty expired at the end of last year.

Brazil has been trying sell eight refineries, which would end Petrobras's virtual monopoly in the country's refining sector and open one of the world's largest fuel markets to private investors. Petrobras is currently negotiating six of them and is expecting two more offers by the end of the first quarter, the company said in a filing. Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4.SA), is trying to get Ultrapar to boost its offer before agreeing to exclusive talks, three people close to the deal said. Offers below Petrobras's initial price range have made the company miss its internal deadline to sign a deal by the end of 2020. Ultrapar said Refap would be complementary to its portfolio, helping increase efficiency. In the oil and gas sector, Ultrapar controls fuel distributor Ipiranga, gas distributor Ultragaz and bulk storage company Ultracargo. Raízen, a joint venture between Royal Dutch Shell PLC (RDSa.L) and Brazilian ethanol producer Cosan SA (CSAN3.SA), has also bid for Refap, two of the sources said. A second round of offers has not been ruled out, the people said. Raízen declined to comment. Indian conglomerate Essar Group, which had pre-qualified for the binding phase, dropped out of the competition, the people said. Ultrapar and Raizen have also bid for refinery Repar, which supplies the relatively affluent states of Parana, Santa Catarina, Sao Paulo and Mato Grosso, the sources said. Petrobras has hesitated to designate a winning bidder because it considers the prices too low, three of the people said. In its filing, Petrobras said it has received binding offers and is analyzing them. Refap and Repar are located in Brazil's southern region and have a production capacity of 200,000 barrels per day each, or about 18% of the country's capacity. Antitrust rules would bar Petrobras from selling the units to the same firm. Elsewhere, Petrobras is in exclusive talks with Abu Dhabi investor Mubadala Investment Co to sell its Bahia unit RLAM. Those talks, at a more advanced stage, could bring a deal as soon as this month, two of the people said. Petrobras said on its statement on Tuesday night it is expecting final offers from all RLAM competitors based on the contract terms set with Mubadala. No prices were disclosed. The producer has also received binding offers for its refining units Reman, Lubnor and SIX, the company said in the filing. No exclusivity was set, which allows rebids, one person said. Petrobras expects binding offers for its Pernambuco refinery RNEST and Minas Gerais state refinery REGAP by the end of the quarter.  DIVESTMENT PLANS Petrobras has been trying to sell refineries for almost a decade with no success, facing resistance from politicians, union workers and local contractors. A history of government fuel price intervention has also scared away investors in the past. Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco, who took office in January 2019 appointed by President Jair Bolsonaro, relaunched the process as part of a plan to focus on deep-water exploration and cut debt. On December 2019, Petrobras signed an agreement with antitrust watchdog Cade to privatize eight refineries, or about half of Brazil's fuel production capacity, by December 2021. Petrobras has told potential buyers it is not obliged to sell the plants if offers fall below its internal price range. A decrease in fuel demand accelerated by the Covid-19 pandemic is a key reason behind the price gap between Petrobras and potential buyers, three of the people said. The sales will also allow Petrobras to raise fresh money and reduce debt. "

-29.436851931516916," DBO Energy takes pole position in Petrobras deepwater sale, sources say RIO DE JANEIRO, Jan 12 (Reuters) - DBO Energy, an oil and gas firm backed by Germany’s RWE AG, is in bilateral talks with Petrobras to buy the Golfinho oilfield cluster in Brazil, two sources said, as the state-run oil company kicks its ambitious divestment program back into gear. Golfinho is one of dozens of legacy production assets that Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the company is formally known, is selling in a bid to reduce debt and sharpen its focus on a prolific, deepwater formation called the ‘pre-salt.’ The company struggled to deleverage for most of last year, as the pandemic sapped demand for oil-producing assets. But in recent months, Petrobras has sped back up its asset sales, accepting binding offers for a number of major assets, including five refineries and an onshore oilfield cluster known as Urucu. Both Petrobras and DBO declined to comment. Golfinho, a mature, deepwater cluster located off the coast of Espirito Santo state, was among the last major production assets that Petrobras put on the block before COVID-19 hit Brazil in earnest. The cluster was producing 14,900 barrels of oil and condensate per day, according to January 2020 bidding documents. One person involved in the deal said the parties were discussing dollar values in the nine-digit range. Any deal is still months from closing, the source added. Norway’s BW Energy Ltd was among the firms that mulled a bid, but ultimately decided not to make a binding offer, according to another source, as well as a third source with knowledge of the matter. All the sources requested anonymity to discuss confidential matters. BW did not respond to a request for comment. Rio de Janeiro-based DBO is composed of Brazilian and Norwegian executives who have experience operating mature assets both in Brazil and in the North Sea, according to the company’s website.

Petrobras said that it has recovered 4.8 billion reais in settlements and compensation related to the Car Wash investigation to date. Earlier this month, Vitol’s U.S. subsidiary agreed to pay $164 million to resolve U.S. government probes into alleged bribes the company paid in Brazil and other countries to boost its oil trading business.

The lawsuit requests that a judge freeze almost 1 billion reais ($198 million) in assets in order to make sure funds are available to pay for damages resulting from the alleged scheme. Prosecutors said there was evidence of bribe payments to Petrobras employees in exchange for privileged information that allowed Maersk to secure shipping contracts between 2006 and 2014. Former employees of Petrobras, formally Petroleo Brasileiro SA, were also included in the lawsuit. “We take these allegations very seriously and remain committed to cooperating with the authorities during the investigation as well as running our business in compliance with anti-corruption laws in all operating locations,” Maersk said in an emailed statement. The shipping company said the investigation is ongoing and that it will not comment further on the case. Petrobras said it has been recognized by Brazilian authorities as the victim of an array of corruption schemes uncovered by prosecutors in recent years. It said it is assisting prosecutors with dozens of civil and criminal cases. The civil lawsuit is the latest chapter in the sweeping corruption investigation known as Car Wash. Initiated in 2014, the probe has snared scores of politicians and business leaders in Latin America and beyond. Recent phases of the probe have taken aim at multinational companies based outside Brazil. Last week, prosecutors took a similar action against oil trader Trafigura for allegedly bribing Petrobras employees in order to secure fuel shipments. In August, Brazilian prosecutors pressed criminal charges against two individuals involved in the alleged Maersk bribery scheme. In Brazil, prosecutors can press criminal charges only against individuals, and companies are subject only to administrative sanctions, which can include fines."

-29.573462672319074," Brazil's Petrobras could expand into Guyana, CEO says RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil’s Petrobras could expand its operations into neighboring Guyana, if the regulatory environment does not improve in Brazil, CEO Roberto Castello Branco said on Thursday, the first official admission of interest in the hot frontier oil play. Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the company is formally known, has exploration interests off Brazil’s northern coast. There is speculation among geologists that parts of that area could share similar geology with Guyana, whose production is quickly expanding after a series of blockbuster offshore finds. Petrobras executives have been asked in the past if they would be interested in the nation. However, they have consistently said that they prefer to focus on oil exploration and production in Brazil. During the biennial Rio Oil & Gas conference, Castello Branco said onerous environmental licensing requirements in Brazil were pushing the oil firm to consider Guyana. “We have (in northern Brazil) the potential for a great oil basin and we’re barred. At the same time, Guyana is taking advantage of the situation,” Castello Branco said. “(Guyana) attracts us. For now, we’re continuing to invest in Brazil, but it’s possible we go over there as well, preferring that to generating value, generating jobs in a very poor region of Brazil.” Exploration in northern Brazil has generated significant controversy and regulatory pressure in part because of the presence of an extensive coral reef off the coast of Brazil and neighboring French Guiana. In September, France’s Total SA exited a cluster of five exploration blocks dubbed Foz de Amazonas, and sold its stake to Petrobras, following difficulties with environmental permitting."
-22.673271333889698," Petrobras prioritizes carbon cuts as Equinor pursues renewables in Brazil RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Petrobras will invest in technologies to cut the carbon footprint of its oil extraction activities rather than in renewables over the next five years, the Brazilian state-controlled company’s chief executive said. Roberto Castello Branco has repeatedly said Petroleo Brasileiro SA, known as Petrobras, has no comparative advantage in renewable energy and that many environmental targets put forward by its European competitors are fanciful. His comments on Tuesday contrasted with those made earlier by Equinor ASA CEO Anders Opedal at an oil industry conference in which he said the Norwegian company was scouting for offshore wind opportunities in Brazil. Opedal referred during the Rio Oil & Gas conference to a 2018 memorandum of understanding (MOU) between Equinor and Petrobras to pursue offshore wind projects in Brazil. That has not so far resulted in any potential projects and Castello Branco’s comments suggest it is unlikely to do so. “We do not expect to invest a dollar in renewables over the next five years,” Castello Branco said while discussing the company’s updated five-year business plan during a presentation to analysts and investors. Petrobras was taking emissions-reduction seriously through other means, such as studying the use of hydrogen-powered ships, even for long-haul routes, Petrobras logistics and sales chief André Chiarini said in another presentation. Castello Branco said that Petrobras is likely to sell a clutch of offshore natural gas pipelines via an initial public offering in the third quarter of 2021. But this estimate could change, in part because the potential IPO requires an agreement with other stakeholders."

The prosecutors are also seeking a court order to freeze 1 billion reais ($187.55 million) of the defendants’ assets pending a final ruling on the matter. The allegations center around 31 fuel oil purchases and sale transactions carried out between May 2012 and October 2013. In Brazil, prosecutors can only press criminal charges against individuals, and companies are only subject to administrative sanctions, which can include fines. In an emailed message to Reuters, Trafigura did not comment on the lawsuit specifically. Instead, it referred to a September 2019 statement, where it said it has a zero-tolerance policy on bribery and corruption. “Any suggestion that Trafigura’s current management knew that its payments would be used to make improper payments to employees of Petrobras is not correct,” that statement said. This is the first legal action targeting a trading firm since Brazilian prosecutors started to investigate Petrobras’ fuel sales in 2018 as part of the so-called Car Wash graft probe, which is ongoing and started in 2014. Until now, only individuals had been targeted in such lawsuits. The allegedly irregular trades between Trafigura and Petrobras involved the sale of 7.062 million barrels of fuel oil, the prosecutors said. They said they found evidence Trafigura secured those contracts by paying 6.86 million reais in bribes to former employees of Petrobras’ commercial area.

-18.390800744580922," Brazil's Petrobras aims to step up oil exports and asset sales RIO DE JANEIRO/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil’s Petrobras on Monday projected a surge in oil exports and divestments over the next five years as it steps up plans to target overseas demand and cut debt. In a virtual presentation to investors during the state-controlled company’s annual investor day, Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as it is formally known, said domestic oil sales are expected to fall to 1.252 million barrels per day (bpd) in the 2021-2025 period, versus 1.348 million bpd in the five years ending in 2019. Crude exports, however, are forecast to climb to an average of 891,000 bpd from the 445,000 bpd that the company averaged in the five-year period ending in 2019. China has emerged as Petrobras’ most important export market, but Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco has said the company is working to develop other markets, such as India. In the same presentation, accompanied by executives’ comments, the company said it planned to divest $25 billion to $35 billion in assets from 2021 to 2025. That was up from the $20 billion to $30 billion in divestments projected for 2020-2024. The comments and presentation reflected plans to shift back into gear after the crude price crash and economic downturn brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic, which slowed its divestment programme to a crawl. Last week the company gave the first glimpse of its five-year business plan, featuring a lower than expected 2021 production outlook. The company’s Brazil-listed preferred shares fell 1.5% in Monday afternoon trade, slightly underperforming Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa equities index, which was down 1.1%. Petrobras executives said the divestment of gas distribution business Liquigas should be formalized in December. Preliminary sale agreements for the company’s REFAP and REPAR refineries should be signed in the first quarter, with the signing of the RLAM refinery likely by January, Castello Branco told journalists later in the day. The company expects to accept binding offers for two more refineries - known as REGAP and RNEST - in the first quarter, he added. However, Petrobras will have to restart the leasing process for a natural gas facility in Bahia state in early 2021 after the only bidder in the previous round was disqualified because of corruption-related concerns, said Petrobras downstream head Anelise Lara. Petrobras will also need to remodel the divestment of its Gaspetro natural gas operation after antitrust authorities rejected its sale this month."
-20.221331172826595," UPDATE 1-Brazil's Petrobras slashes spending plan as lower oil prices bite (Updates with details) RIO DE JANEIRO, Nov 25 (Reuters) - Brazil’s state-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA cut its five-year investment plan by 27% from a year ago to $55 billion to preserve cash, as the coronavirus pandemic drove down global oil demand and prices. In a filing on Thursday, Petrobras, as the Rio de Janeiro company is known, said it will focus on the prolific deep-water oil fields in the so-called pre-salt area in the Atlantic Ocean as it sells non-core assets to reduce debt. Petrobras said it plans to invest $46 billion, or 84% of the total investments, in exploration and production. That compares with $64 billion a year ago. The company said it would limit spending approval to new projects that can be profitable with oil prices as low as $35 per barrel. The reduction was in line with a Sept. 14 filing in which Petrobras had said it would limit exploration and production spending to $40 billion to $50 billion as the coronavirus spread crushed demand and prices. Before the pandemic, in November 2019, Petrobras said it would invest $75.7 billion between 2021 and 2024. The spending cut will cut Petrobras’ daily production to around 2.75 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) in 2021, it said, from an expected output of 2.84 million barrels per day in 2020.

21.04071428822282," Brazil's Petrobras opens sale process for legacy Marlim oil cluster RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil's Petroleo Brasileiro SA PETR4.SA put up for sale a 50% stake in its legacy deep-water Marlim oil cluster, the company said on Monday in a filing. In production since the 1980’s in the Atlantic Ocean’s Campos basin, the giant Marlim cluster has four fields - Marlim, Voador, Marlim Leste and Marlim Sul - producing 217,000 barrels of oil per day, or almost 10% of the company’s total output. The sale, in its initial stage, is part of Petrobras’ plans to sell non-core assets to cut debt and focus investments in the world’s biggest deep-water discoveries this century, in the so-called pre-salt area. The newer pre-salt reserves, found beneath a thick layer of salt at the seabed of Brazil’s waters, had a fast ramp-up in the past decade and are responsible for more than 70% of Petrobras’ production. Once Brazil’s largest oil field with more than 500,000 barrels per day, Marlim has seen declining production in the past decade. Today, Marlim Sul and Marlim are, respectively, Brazil’s sixth and eighth largest oil fields in Brazil. Marlim Sul has the largest number of producing wells in Brazil, 67. The four fields, which also produce 3.6 million cubic meters of natural gas, are located between 90 and 150 kilometers off the coast and up to 2,500 meters below the ocean floor. Petrobras shares rose more than 4% in Sao Paulo following the announcement."

The SFO said it opened a civil recovery investigation into Julio Faerman in 2015 after the former agent for Netherlands-based oil and gas services group SBM Offshore admitted paying bribes to win contracts from Brazil’s state oil company Petroleo Brasileiro (Petrobras). The body said it suspected Faerman had partly bought a 4.25 million apartment in west London with corrupt funds. Faerman is subject to a co-operation agreement with Brazilian prosecutors after paying a $54 million settlement, according to a London High Court judgment handed down in July. A London lawyer representing Faerman declined to comment. “This is an excellent result for the SFO, sending a clear message that we will not sit back and allow the United Kingdom to be a safe harbour for dirty money,” said Liz Baker, head of the SFO’s proceeds of crime and international assistance division.

25.51894370873269," Brazil's Petrobras hunts for buyers in India as oil exports take off RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - As Brazil's state-controlled Petrobras PETR4.SA rapidly boosts oil output and exports, executives are looking to a new market: India. In an interview as part of the Reuters Commodity Trading Summit, Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco said that crude sales to China - an increasingly vital export market for Brazilian oil - would continue to rise amid strong industrial growth there and the ramping up of some of the world’s largest offshore fields in Brazil. But Petrobras’ newly reorganized marketing and logistics division is actively scouting out additional markets, particularly in Asia. The firm, for instance, has started hunting for new buyers in India, which Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the company is formally known, hopes will be a relevant client within three years as it moves to diversify its buyer mix and minimize its dependence on China. “We expect this to have a positive evolution in the near future, in three years approximately to have a consolidated position in the (Indian) market,” Castello Branco told Reuters. The company has also been raising fuel oil exports to Singapore. The country, which acts as a shipping hub, has boosted purchases of Petrobras’s low-sulfur fuel to comply with new maritime legislation intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Production from its massive, deepwater Buzios field is widening Brazil’s oil surplus and allowed Petrobras to raise its 2020 production target by 5% in the past weeks. The producer is also preparing to face stronger internal competition as it sells refineries and tries to end its near monopoly in Brazilian fuel production. “In order to face stronger competition, we put in place a logistics, sales and marketing division...to act as an active seller, not a passive seller,” the CEO said. Despite having recently risen to third largest oil supplier to China, ahead of the United States, Brazil is still a relatively small seller to the Asian country compared with Russia and Saudi Arabia, Castello Branco said - but not for the lack of appetite. China would absorb all oil Brazil has to offer and it often pays a premium for its sweet crude from Brazil’s Tupi field, he said. In April, Petrobras hit an historical mark of 1 million barrels per day of crude shipped to China as a sharp drop in internal fuel consumption diverted oil away from domestic refineries. “Right now, we don’t have the capacity to sell 1 million (barrels per day),” Castello Branco said. “With the increase in oil production, we will have availability to do that”."
25.51894370873269," Exclusive: Essar, Raizen and Ultra consider bid for Petrobras' refinery SAO PAULO/RIO (Reuters) - Brazil’s Petroleo Brasileiro SA is set to receive binding offers on Dec. 10 for its Rio Grande do Sul state refinery Refap, with Indian conglomerate Essar Group and local firms Raizen and Ultrapar Participacoes SA among its potential bidders, people familiar with the negotiations said. All three companies have been pre-qualified for the binding phase for Refap refinery, also known as Alberto Pasqualini, the sources added, declining to be named as the details are confidential. Petrobras, as Brazil’s state-controlled producer is known, will also receive offers on the same day for its Parana state refinery - Presidente Getulio Vargas, or Repar - as part of a rebidding sale process. In September, both Raizen and Ultrapar delivered bids that were too similar in value. Petrobras, Ultrapar and Raízen declined to comment. Essar did not immediately respond to a Reuters request on the matter. The bids are part of Petrobras’s plans to end its virtual monopoly in refining in Brazil and open one of the largest fuel markets to private competitors. Nine refining units are for sale, or about half of Brazil’s refining capacity. Seeking bids for two refineries on the same day is a switch in strategy by Petrobras aimed at boosting competition for the assets - and also potentially generating higher offers. Both Refap and Repar are located in Brazil’s southern region and have a production capacity of 200,000 barrels per day each, or about 18% of the country’s capacity. In accordance with antitrust rules, the units cannot be bought by the same firm after a divestiture by Brazil’s state-controlled oil company. The latest Petrobras attempt to privatize its refineries suffered long pauses as the divestments were questioned in court and international fuel demand and oil prices plunged during the pandemic. This week, Petrobras will also receive offers for its so-called Lubnor refinery, in Brazil’s northwestern region, with a processing capacity of 8,000 oil barrels per day. Currently, Petrobras is in exclusive negotiations with Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala Investment Co for the sale of its second-largest refinery, known as Rlam. Essar has also bid for Rlam and may restart negotiations with Petrobras in case of a rebid. Petrobras said last month it has received binding offers for its Reman refinery, in the Amazonian city of Manaus."
50.224219894205966," Brazil's Petrobras says major divestments nearing finish line RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Petrobras is in the advanced stages of several major divestments, executives said on Thursday, indicating that the company’s ambitious deleveraging program may quicken after a pause during the worst of the coronavirus outbreak in Brazil. Speaking to analysts following the company's third-quarter results, executives at Petroleo Brasileiro SA PETR4.SA, as the state-run oil firm is formally known, said it hopes to finalize negotiations to sell its RLAM refinery by the end of the year and has recently received binding offers for its REMAN refinery, in the Amazonian city of Manaus. The company expects to receive binding offers for its REPAR refinery in southern Brazil in December, they added. Petrobras has been working to sell dozens of non-core assets in recent years in a bid to reduce debt and sharpen its focus on offshore oil production and exploration. Among those divestments are the sale of nine refineries that are expected to rake in well over $10 billion cumulatively for the company. But the divestment process had ground to a crawl in recent months amid the crash in crude prices and a more general slowdown in the global economy. The company expects Brazilian antitrust authorities to approve the sale of gas distribution unit Liquigas in November, Chief Financial Officer Andrea Almeida said. The firm also continues to examine an initial public offering for a collection of offshore midstream assets, she added. Executives were not as sanguine about some other divestments. Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco said a planned sale of its stake in the TBG gas pipeline unit, which connects Brazil and Bolivia, was being held up by regulatory issues. The company will not sell its stake in petrochemical company Braskem SA BRKM5.SA until that firm makes significant improvements related to governance and environmental liabilities, he added. Brazil-listed preferred shares in Petrobras were up 2.3% in late afternoon trade, after the company beat margin estimates on Wednesday evening, even as profit missed expectations due to one-off charges. Brazil's benchmark Bovespa equities index .BVSP was up 1.2%. In terms of production, executives flagged a modest decrease in fourth quarter output and increase in lifting costs due to scheduled maintenance. Still, they said, a number of new wells had come online in some of the company’s most promising offshore fields in the fourth quarter. The company has noticed a short-term decrease in demand for its products in Europe due to the resurgence of COVID-19 there, said André Chiarini, the company’s head of logistics and trading. However, demand for Petrobras fuel in China remains strong, he added."
63.060290493657526," Brazil's Petrobras posts solid margins, but one-off charges hit profits RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil’s Petrobras posted an unexpected loss thanks to substantial non-recurring fiscal charges, even as operating earnings were bolstered by a recovery in fuel sales and oil revenue. In a Wednesday securities filing, Petroleo Brasileiro SA PETR4.SA, as the state-run oil company is formally known, posted a third-quarter loss of 1.546 billion reais ($275 million). Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), adjusted for some one-off items, came in at 33.4 billion reais, above the Refinitiv estimate of 29.7 billion reais. Among the one-off charges that the company highlighted was the payment of 1.9 billion reais to two state governments to settle outstanding tax disputes, as well as a significant bond buyback program. Declines in the Brazilian real against the U.S. dollar helped magnify some losses, the company added. Petrobras said that, excluding one-off items, the company would have posted a net income of 3.2 billion reais, trouncing the Refinitiv estimate of 736 million reais. Among the positive highlights for the company was significant growth in sales, particularly of gasoline and diesel. Net revenue came in at 70.7 billion reais in the quarter, up 39% from the previous period. “The recovery of diesel and gasoline sales stands out,” the company said. “These products were heavily affected by COVID-19 in the second quarter and their recovery was the strongest in our portfolio, both in terms of volume and pricing.” Crude exports to China - which had sky-rocketed in recent quarters as it ramped up output as the worst of the pandemic passed - slowed to pre-pandemic levels. Meanwhile, exports to other markets, such as the United States, Spain and Indonesia, grew significantly from the second quarter. Even Chinese demand may have recovered late in the quarter. Brazil jumped to become China’s third-biggest crude oil supplier in September, import data showed on Sunday, as China’s independent refiners scooped up cheap supplies of the South American exporter’s relatively high quality oil. Petrobras said that median production costs fell from $7.90 per barrel of oil equivalent in the second quarter to $4.50 in the third quarter, thanks in part to efficiency gains and in part to the depreciation of the real.

When gross debt is above $60 billion, Petrobras can propose the payment of dividends to shareholders when there is no profit as long as the company’s net has been reduced in the previous 12-month period “if management believes that the company’s financial sustainability will be preserved,” the statement said.

The platform was originally scheduled for the Tupi field, which will have a new development plan agreed with the partners in the project, Shell RDSa.L (25% stake) and Petrogal (10%).

46.453398942657046," Brazil's Petrobras boosts production outlook in recovery from COVID-19 halts RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian state-run oil company Petrobras said on Tuesday that 2020 production should exceed previously disclosed estimates, as the firm ramps up production at some of its most prolific offshore oilfields. Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the company is formally known, said it expects to produce roughly 2.84 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) this year, up from its previous estimate of 2.7 million boepd. Crude output should reach 2.28 million barrels per day, the company said, up from its previous estimate of 2.2 million bpd. Both estimates have a margin of error of 1.5 percentage points. The revision will not come as a shock to the market as the company has consistently produced at levels above formal guidance this year, and executives had previously faced questions about whether their guidance was too conservative. But it nonetheless underlines how Petrobras has been able to recover quickly from the worst of the coronavirus pandemic, which severely hit demand for its fuels and caused various stoppages at its oil production facilities amid COVID-19 outbreaks. The revised outlook came as the company released its third quarter production figures. In a securities filing, the company said it produced 2.952 million boepd in the third quarter, up 5.4% from the previous quarter and up 2.6% from the same period last year. The company attributed the increased production in part to the ramp-up of its Atapu field and a strong performance at the Buzios offshore field, one of the world’s largest. The company called its third quarter production figures “very good, considering the challenging situation imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic.” Petrobras added that it was not suffering from an excess of crude or fuel stocks, and that current stocks were below pre-pandemic levels. Refinery utilization rates were fluctuating at levels around 80% in the third quarter, up from lows of 55% in April."
46.453398942657046," Vitol executive's secret recordings to expand Brazilian oil bribery probe RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian police expanded a long-running corruption probe at state-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA based in part on secret recordings made by a former executive of Swiss trading firm Vitol SA, according to court documents released on Tuesday. Police on Tuesday served warrants seeking documents from six people and two companies as part of what is known as the Car Wash investigation into bribery to win contracts to buy and resell Petrobras fuel. Petrobras said in an e-mailed response it only learned of Tuesday’s warrants after the police operation was made public. Petrobras said it was a victim of corrupt employees and that it has cooperated with authorities, providing information that led to the search warrants. Vitol declined to comment on Tuesday. In the past, it has said it has a zero tolerance policy for bribery and corruption. Prosecutors have alleged at least 12 million reais ($2.14 million) were paid between 2005 and 2015 to Petrobras employees working in Houston, London and Singapore. The search warrants were approved by Judge Gabriela Hardt, based in part on tape recordings and other information provided by Marcio Dutra Goncalves, a former Vitol executive in Brazil, Hardt wrote in authorizing the warrants. “Documentation submitted by Marcio Dutra, together with his collaborative statements, indicates that privileged information were shared at least between 24/10/2005 and 26/11/2014, and would contain the schedule and details of import and export operations by Petrobras,” the judge wrote. Dutra, who was Vitol’s Brazil chief executive for about a decade starting in 2005, is cooperating with prosecutors in exchange for leniency, the court said. He has provided emails, bank records and hundreds of hours of conversations recorded using hidden devices, court documents showed. Dutra recorded the conversations to aid his recollection of events, a person close to the investigation said. Eight audio recordings attached to the court documents contain conversations with former Vitol executives that approved payments to Petrobras employees, prosecutors said. Dutra paid up to 12,000 reais in cash a month to a Petrobras employee named Ricardo Brandao for information on Petrobras strategy and pricing that would give Vitol an advantage over competitors, according to the court filings. He occasionally used his own money and was later reimbursed by Vitol through intermediaries, the filings said. Dutra did not respond to messages left on a mobile phone or email included in court documents. His lawyer, Guilherme San Juan, could not be reached for comment after working hours. Reuters could not establish the whereabouts of Brandao or identify his attorney. Tuesday’s probe expands the reach of authorities’ investigations from oil and bunker fuel trades at Petrobras offices in Houston and Rio de Janeiro to diesel and jet fuel there and in Europe and Asia. No new criminal charges were brought on Tuesday. The investigation into alleged kickbacks spans trades across four continents. Car Wash began in 2014 when a money laundering scheme was discovered at a gas station in Brazil’s capital, Brasilia, that led to top executives at Petrobras. Some of the former Petrobras employees and middle men cited in previous phases of the investigation targeting trading firms have pleaded guilty and are cooperating with authorities in exchange for reduced sentences, Reuters has previously reported. The transactions being reviewed involved 3.3 billion liters of fuel, prosecutors said in a statement on Tuesday. ($1 = 5.6053 reais)"

58.401080742721746," Foreign-backed consortium in talks for Petrobras gas fields in Brazil, sources say RIO DE JANEIRO/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - A consortium of Brazil’s 3R Petroleum and Norway-linked DBO Energy is in bilateral talks with Brazil’s Petrobras to purchase a cluster of offshore natural gas fields, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the matter. The Peroa cluster, located off the coast of Espirito Santo state, would be among the first all-gas offshore fields sold by Petrobras amid a larger push to break the company’s near-monopoly in Brazil’s natural gas value chain. Petroleo Brasileiro SA PETR4.SA, as the state-controlled firm is formally known, has long dominated most segments of the Brazilian natural gas sector. But in recent years, it has begun selling off pipelines and assets in transport and distribution, in a move the company and the government hope will spur competition. Several international firms already produce significant amounts of natural gas in Brazil, as they operate oilfields where so-called associated gas is removed during the production process. Much of that gas is simply reinjected into the ground, however, and few are producing at standalone gas fields. Petrobras and 3R did not respond to a request for comment. DBO declined to comment. In 2019, the Peroa cluster produced just short of 1 million cubic meters of gas per day, though it produced several times that amount in recent years. The cluster also includes the Malombe prospect, discovered in 2011, which studies indicate could produce up to 2.5 million cubic meters daily if developed. Due in part to Peroa’s mature profile, it is expected to be sold for a relatively low price compared with other production assets being offered by Petrobras in the area, said the sources, who requested anonymity due to the confidentiality of the matter. Rio de Janeiro-based DBO is composed of Brazilian and Norwegian executives, and it lists RWE Supply & Trading, an arm of Germany's RWE AG RWEG.DE, as an investor. 3R, founded in part by former Petrobras executives, is backed by investment firm Starboard Restructuring Partners. In early September, it filed for an initial public offering to help pay for acquisitions it has made from Petrobras and to pursue new ones.pet"
64.41629764872596," Brazil's Car Wash corruption probe eyes Petrobras bunker fuel deals SAO PAULO/RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian police on Wednesday expanded the Car Wash corruption investigation to alleged kickbacks valued at $8 million on contracts for bunker fuel bought by state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA PETR4.SA for its fleet of tankers. A police statement said searches were carried out in Rio de Janeiro as part of the investigation, which is targeting unnamed Petrobras officials for their role in the transactions, which were allegedly carried out between 2009 and 2018. The head of Brazil’s “Car Wash” prosecution unit, Alessandro Oliveira, said authorities were looking into transactions in Brazil and Singapore. The statement indicates that a long-running probe into Petrobras’ dealings with some of the world’s largest commodity trading firms - including Vitol, Glencore, and Trafigura - is expanding geographically. Until now, the probe has been largely focused on Petrobras’ Houston operations. In a statement to Reuters, Petrobras said it is the victim of corruption, rather than its perpetrator, and that it has assisted authorities with dozens of criminal investigations, as well as 21 administrative probes. The Car Wash probe, known in Portuguese as Lava Jato, began in 2014 with the arrest of a currency dealer and mushroomed into Brazil’s biggest ever graft scandal, mainly involving Petrobras contracts in which some 200 businessmen, officials and politicians have been convicted. In the Wednesday statement, prosecutors said there were indications Petrobras employees arranged a system with corrupt traders so that sweetheart contracts would be awarded on a rotating basis. They said they were investigating executives of trading companies. In 2019, Reuters reported that Petrobras detected suspicious transactions in its Singapore trading division as early as 2012 but failed to stop them."

Authorities in the United States and Brazil are investigating improper payments to officials at Petrobras, Brazil’s state-run oil company, as part of Brazil’s far-reaching corruption probe, known as Car Wash. The latest U.S. court filings shed new light on the role of energy traders in a scheme that has led to charges against hundreds of powerful business leaders and politicians. Petrobras said it has been collaborating with authorities since 2014 and was a victim of the schemes. Javier Aguilar, a former Vitol Group manager based in Houston, was charged on Tuesday with conspiracy and money laundering involving a $870,000 bribe to Ecuadorian government officials in order to win a $300 million oil contract. It marked the first indictment of an employee of a top commodities trading house in the probe. Aguilar, through his attorney, denied the allegations. The U.S. investigation mirrors efforts in Brazil, where prosecutors are also investigating people connected to trading houses Vitol, Glencore GLEN.L and Trafigura [TRAFGF.UL], according to Brazilian court documents. The U.S. Department of Justice involvement was spurred by the involvement of U.S. banks in the alleged payments. Aguilar was Vitol’s chief negotiator for the oil contract, according to a person familiar with the matter. Aguilar set up contracts with intermediaries in the United States to win the deal, the DOJ said in a release. Vitol said it was aware of the U.S. charges and is cooperating with authorities. The company has anti-bribery and corruption policies and controls in place, a spokeswoman said. Trafigura said it has a zero tolerance policy on bribery and corruption. “Any suggestion that Trafigura’s current management knew that its payments would be used to make improper payments to employees of Petrobras is not correct,” Trafigura said. Glencore declined to comment. Luiz Eduardo Andrade, a Brazilian consultant, separately pleaded guilty to acting as a go-between to win contracts with Brazil's Petrobras, according to a DOJ statement here. Andrade did not reply to requests for comment. Sargeant Marine, a Florida company that once operated a joint venture with Vitol, pleaded guilty on Tuesday to working with Andrade and others to bribe officials in Brazil, Ecuador and Venezuela to win contracts for asphalt, an oil-byproduct. The firm will pay a $16.6 million fine, the DOJ said. Sargeant Marine and Daniel Sargeant, the company’s top executive, declined to comment through their attorneys. Andrade and former Petrobras oil trader Rodrigo Berkowitz were arrested in the United States in December 2018 as part of Brazil’s Car Wash investigations. They have been cooperating with the DOJ and Brazil prosecutors in parallel investigations targeting the oil trading houses, according to two people close to the matter in Brazil. Brazilian prosecutors said at the early stages of the investigation in 2018 that the details being made public were just the “tip of the iceberg” of an international corruption scheme in which trading firms would bribe foreign officials to win contracts. Petrobras this year lifted a ban imposed in 2018 on dealings with traders Vitol, Glencore and Trafigura."
38.13775954685756," Brazil's Petrobras opens rebidding for refinery, but sources say keeping it not ruled out SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian oil company Petrobras PETR4.SA said on Monday it will open another round of bidding for its Repar refinery in the state of Parana after receiving binding offers that were too similar in value. The new round starts as Brazil’s Supreme Court considers blocking Petrobras’ sale of Repar and other refineries, with justices set to rule on the matter by Friday. Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the state-controlled company is formally known, must follow specific legislation aimed at keeping asset sales competitive, including that bids be different. Sales also fall under scrutiny of governmental entities. The company considered the offers low and is asking bidders to raise their prices for the Parana state refinery, according to two people involved in the negotiations who declined to be named as information is private. Even if the Supreme Court approves the sales, Petrobras doesn’t rule out keeping the asset if prices don’t meet the minimum range set by its internal technical team, the people said. Petrobras said in a statement on Monday that three separate groups led by Ultrapar UGPA3.SA, Raizen and China's Sinopec are part of this phase of the competition. The producer did not give any details about the companies' bids. The prices are highly secret in this phase of the competition. Repar is Brazil’s fifth largest refinery, able to process 208,000 barrels per day, or 9% of the country’s capacity. Petrobras has been trying to sell refineries since at least 2012 with no success, and still produces more than 98% of fuels in Brazil. Lack of buyers for fear of fuel price interference, restrictions by an audit court and anti-privatization movements have prevented sales in the past. More recently, Congress and the Supreme Court have also raised impediments. The winner of this phase of the Repar competition would be able to exclusively negotiate the contract terms with Petrobras, a process which can take months. According to Petrobras’ internal rules, if the contract terms substantially change after the negotiation, which often happens, the oil company would need to call back competitors for a third round of bids, based on price only."
36.37516900107185," Three Brazilian justices vote against Petrobras refinery privatizations BRASILIA (Reuters) - Three justices on Brazil's Supreme Court have voted against allowing state-owned oil company Petrobras PETR4.SA to go ahead with the planned sale of eight refineries, according to the court's website. Justices Marco Aurélio Mello and Ricardo Lewandowski voted to stop the privatizations, according to the court’s website on Monday, after justice Edson Fachin similarly voted against it on Friday. Brazil’s Congress had requested that the court suspend the transactions. The Supreme Court has until Friday to rule on the matter, with the other nine justices yet to cast their votes. Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as Petrobras is formally known, is in talks to sell refineries in Bahia and Parana states as part of an overall divestment plan that aims to sell eight refineries. The company is in exclusive talks to sell the Rlam refinery in Bahia to Abu Dhabi state investor Mubadala Investment Co. Petrobras' bid to sell its Repar facility in Parana has attracted interest from Raizen, a joint venture between Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L and Brazil's Cosan CSAN3.SA, as well as fuel company Ultrapar Participacoes UGPA3.SA."

32.51748167403372," Petrobras says on track to raise Rio's LNG import capacity by 50%, pending license RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil's Petrobras PETR4.SA has successfully concluded tests that will allow for a 50% capacity expansion at its Rio de Janeiro liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminal to 30 million cubic meters per day, the company said on Thursday. Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the company is formally known, said it is in the process of obtaining government permits to expand the terminal’s capacity. The terminal is used to convert the natural gas imported by Brazil by sea in a super-chilled liquefied version back to its gaseous form, a process known as regasification. Brazil is expanding its LNG facilities to take advantage of low international prices. The tests completed by Petrobras were part of the requirements by Rio’s environmental agency Inea and by Brazil’s national oil regulator ANP. Petrobras has not specified the timing for conclusion of the licensing process. The company’s Guanabara bay terminal in Rio de Janeiro currently has capacity to process 20 million cubic meters of gas per day through a floating storage and regasification unit (FSRU). The terminal consists of an island type pier with two berths for mooring and anchoring an FSRU vessel and a supply vessel, the company said."
34.7037294535684," Exclusive: Petrobras resumes oil trading with Vitol, Trafigura and Glencore LONDON/RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil's state-run oil firm Petrobras PETR4.SA has lifted its ban on trading with major commodity traders Vitol, Trafigura and Glencore GLEN.L, in place since Brazilian prosecutors announced a bribery probe in 2018, the company told Reuters. “After a temporary suspension period with the companies cited, the company re-initiated business after adopting and perfecting a series of specific measures meant to bring more security to the commercial relationship,” Petrobras said in a statement to Reuters. Brazilian prosecutors announced in early December 2018 that they were investigating the three major energy trading firms, along with a number of smaller ones, for paying at least $31 million in bribes to Petrobras employees in exchange for sweetheart oil deals. The prosecutors have alleged the top brass at the firms were fully aware of the alleged bribery scheme. Petrobras said in its statement late on Monday that it had standardized and improved the monitoring of negotiations from calls to messages, instituted “Know your client” procedures and carried out integrity checks of its traders, among other measures. Vitol, Glencore and Trafigura declined to comment. One source familiar with the matter said the suspension had been lifted around three months ago. After Brazilian prosecutors announced their investigation, the U.S. Justice Department opened its own probe and Swiss authorities searched the trading firms’ offices in Geneva in November last year at Brazil’s request. Vitol and Trafigura have repeatedly said they have a “zero tolerance policy in respect of bribery and corruption”. Vitol said it was cooperating with authorities. Glencore has previously said it takes ethics and compliance seriously and was cooperating with authorities. Trafigura has said that “any suggestion that Trafigura’s current management knew that its payments would be used to make improper payments to employees of Petrobras is not correct.”"

The Almirante Tamandaré floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) unit is set to be Brazil’s largest, with capacity to produce 225,000 barrels of oil a day and 12 million cubic meters of gas, Petrobras said. The FPSO will be the sixth at the Buzios field, one of the world’s largest oil discoveries this century, and is planned to start production in 2024, Petrobras said. The company will pay daily rates to lease the vessel from SBM, which will build it. Petrobras will hire the ship directly from SBM as currently there are no other suppliers available, the company said. Petrobras has not yet completed tenders for two additional FPSOs planned for Buzios, the company said."

Brazil’s federal police served 25 search warrants as part of the sweeping “Car Wash” probe, one of the world’s largest-ever corruption investigations. No arrests were made on Thursday. The warrants were related to 7.7 billion reais ($1.45 billion) in suspected fraudulent foreign-exchange transactions carried out between 2008 and 2011 at Petrobas, formally known as Petroleo Brasileiro SA One warrant was for Larry Carris Cardoso who was in a “relevant managerial” position in the finance department, according to a copy of the warrant request seen by Reuters. The inclusion of a Petrobras manager in the latest probe underscores the difficulties Brazilian authorities have had in cleaning up the sprawling firm. Prosecutors say Cardoso was responsible for 228 foreign exchange transactions worth approximately 2.8 billion reais, in which some of the money may have been skimmed off the top and kicked back to corrupt actors. Cardoso did not immediately respond to requests for comment sent by email and LinkedIn. In a May document submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission by Petrobras, he is cited as its Loans and Financing Administration General Manager. Petrobras said in a statement it is conducting internal investigations, adding it “actively collaborated with the authorities in the probe and provided information that resulted in (today’s) operation.” It also said in a later statement on Thursday that it had made a decision to fire one of the employees cited in the investigation but did not name the employee. Various branches of Petrobras have been under investigation since 2014, when Car Wash began.

Brazil’s federal police served 25 search warrants as part of the sweeping “Car Wash” probe, one of the world’s largest-ever corruption investigations. No arrests were made. The Thursday searches were related to alleged fraud related to 7.7 billion reais ($1.45 billion) of foreign-exchange transactions carried out between 2008 and 2011. Among the targets was Larry Carris Cardoso who was in a “relevant managerial” position in the finance department as of this year, according to a copy of the warrant request seen by Reuters. An internal company registry seen by Reuters listed him as an active employee.

17.126440404785342," Brazil lower house approves reform of natural gas sector BRASILIA, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Brazil’s lower house approved on Tuesday the basic text of a bill to further open up the natural gas market to private competition and break the monopoly held by state-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras). The bill passed by 351 votes for to 101 against. The new legal framework changes natural gas distribution from a regime of concessions by the government to one of authorizations by the country’s oil and gas regulator ANP, thus reducing bureaucracy for building pipelines. The bill, which still needs to pass the Senate, would also open up competition by changing the vertical structure of the gas sector so producers cannot be distributors and vice-versa. Mines and Energy Minister Bento Albuquerque expects the law to unlock 40 billion reais ($7.41 billion) in private investment for the gas sector, while Economy Minister Paulo Guedes said it will bring a “shock of cheap energy” for Brazilian industries. Congressman Laercio Oliveira, who presented the bill in the House, told Reuters last week it would reduce the cost of gas in Brazil that is more than double international prices. “We have the most expensive gas in the world, which forced hundreds of industries to shut down in Brazil or change their source of energy,” the legislator said in an interview. For Abrace, the association of industries that are large consumers of electricity, the law will allow for a “freer market” for companies to freely access gas pipelines and other infrastructure, from LNG terminals (liquefied natural gas) to processing plants.

17.135854323996355," Brazil's Lower House close to vote end of Petrobras virtual monopoly in gas industry BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil’s lower house is set to vote on Tuesday to pass a bill that can further open up the natural gas market to private investors by breaking the monopoly held by state-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras)SA>. If approved, the law could reduce natural gas prices in Brazil, says Congressman Laercio Oliveira, who will present the bill in the House. Its backers say the law could attract 60 billion reais ($11 billion) in private investments and generate 4 million jobs. Oliveira said he expects the bill to be approved without changes in the Lower House. The bill would still need to be sent to the Senate for approval. Petrobras, as the producer is known, lost the monopoly in the oil and gas sector by law more than two decades ago, but in practice kept a virtual monopoly in the natural gas industry. The company started to scale back control a couple of years ago, by selling assets including thousands of miles of pipelines. The reduction of Petrobras’s control over the industry now depends on passage of legislation to allow more private companies enter the sector. “We have the most expensive gas in the world and, which forced hundreds of industries to shut down in Brazil or change their source of energy,” the legislator told Reuters, saying natural gas costs more than twice in Brazil than in the international market. The bill aims to reduce bureaucracy in handling concessions and building pipelines, with only one authorization needed from the Brazilian oil and gas industry regulator known as ANP. Last week, Petrobras and Golar Power chiefs criticized in two separate webinars last-minute attempts to change the proposal that would be presented in the House. Petrobras CEO Roberto Castello Branco said there were private groups interested in building pipelines subsidized by governments. “That would be a terrible idea and bad use of taxpayer’s money,” he said on Friday. The bill would also open competition by changing the structure of the gas sector so producers cannot be distributors and vice-versa, Oliveira said. Petrobras has shut down two fertilizer plants in recent years that ran on natural gas, he said. Exports from the units would be more competitive if gas prices were lower, he said. Economy Minister Paulo Guedes also likes the bill that was first proposed in 2013 because it will increase federal tax revenues, Oliveira said."
17.135854323996355," Brazil's Petrobras plans for office staff to work from home up to three days a week Rio de Janeiro (Reuters) - Petroleo Brasileiro SA has decided that when its office staff returns, they will be able to permanently work from home up to three days a week and in the office two days a week, the company said in a note on Monday. Petrobras, as the state-controlled oil producer is known, said participation will be voluntary. The model meets workers’ demands for more work flexibility as well as reduces office space costs, the company said. Petrobras management extended a total work-from-home plan until the end of the year to prevent COVID-19 spread. The new hybrid model will start when the producer announces its office return schedule, it said. The oil company has kept as much as 90% of its 21,000 administrative staff home since March when the coronavirus pandemic hit Brazil. Chief Executive Officer Roberto Castello Branco has said the pandemic has unveiled opportunities for cost reduction. The CEO has been on a crusade to cut costs since he took office in January 2019. He announced a $8.1 billion cost-reduction plan through 2023, including dismissal programs and office space reductions. Since then, he has decided to cut back overseas offices to five from 18, shutting locations in New York, Mexico City, Libya, Angola, Nigeria, Tanzania, Iran and Tokyo. Petrobras has been also vacating entire buildings in Rio and Sao Paulo that it does not own. The company decided last year to concentrate employees at its iconic headquarters in downtown Rio, where the cost per desk is cheaper than in rented corporate buildings nearby."

In a securities filing, Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the firm is formally known, said it had begun the teaser phase for the sale of the oilfields and the nearby Clara Camarao refinery in the state of Rio Grande do Norte. The oilfields, known collectively as Polo Potiguar, produced roughly 23,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil in 2020 and 124,000 cubic meters per day of gas, while the refinery has an installed capacity of 39,600 bpd, the company said. Petrobras is years into a drive to sell of tens of billions of dollars of non-core assets in a bid to reduce its hefty debt load and sharpen its focus on deepwater oil production. Clara Camarao adds to the list of eight refineries Petrobras has previously put up for sale: RNEST, REPAR, RLAM, REFAP, REGAP, REMAN, LUBNOR and SIX. That group accounts for half of Brazil’s refining capacity, or 1.1 million bpd. Following the crash in crude oil prices earlier this year, the company announced that it was permanently idling its shallow-water fields, which tend to have relatively high lifting costs. During the teaser phase, Petrobras makes certain information about the assets and the eligibility criteria for bidders available. The Clara Camarao refinery serves the regional market, and its main products are diesel, gasoline and jet fuel, Petrobras said."

9.939394775645269," Brazil prosecutors accuse two in alleged Petrobras-Maersk corruption scheme SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian prosecutors pressed charges on Friday against two people for an alleged scheme to obtain confidential market information from Petrobras PETR4.SA to benefit A.P. Moller-Maersk MAERSKb.CO, the world's largest shipping company. The case stems from an investigation that started in 2014 as part of Brazil’s sprawling Car Wash scandal, which has since included suppliers like Maersk and uncovered corruption throughout multiple countries in more than 70 police operations. A statement released by prosecutors on Friday said a former Maersk executive in Brazil, Viggo Andersen, participated in a scheme that led to at least $31.7 million in losses for Petrobras. Andersen denies the accusations and will have his innocence proved, his lawyer Paulo Freitas said in a written response. According to prosecutors, Andersen participated in a scheme to bribe a Petrobras executive, through an intermediary, in exchange for privileged information that would guarantee more business to Maersk. Andersen allegedly inflated shipping contract prices and transferred the proceeds to Maersk commercial representative Wanderley Gandra, who acted as a financial operator for the scheme, the prosecutors said. Gandra, according to prosecutors, then sent some of the money to Paulo Roberto Costa, a former Petrobras top executive, who supplied confidential information on the state oil company’s shipping needs back to Maersk, the statement said. Gandra’s lawyer could not immediately be reached for comment. Costa was arrested in 2014 and was the first of more than 100 people who entered a plea deal with prosecutors. He has provided investigators with information on multiple Petrobras contracts he oversaw, including with Maersk and other international offshore suppliers. A judge must still decide whether to start a criminal case against Andersen and Gandra or drop the charges. The alleged crimes relate to the period 2006 to 2014, the prosecution statement said. Andersen left Maersk in 2017, according to his LinkedIn page. Maersk said it takes the “allegations very seriously and remains committed to cooperating with the authorities.” Petrobras has been collaborating with officials since 2014 and will continue to do so, the company said in a written response. Last year, Maersk’s offices in Brazil were raided by prosecutors. Representatives of the Danish company met with Brazilian investigators as far back as 2014 in relation to its dealings with Petrobras during the early stages of the corruption investigation."

-17.220899080399356," Brazil's Ocyan aims for bigger offshore platforms to cement comeback RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Offshore oil industry supplier Ocyan plans to participate in bids for much bigger platforms than it currently has in Brazilian waters, the world’s largest market for floating platforms, Chief Executive Roberto Bischoff told Reuters. He said Ocyan is eyeing contracts potentially worth hundreds of millions of dollars for deepwater platforms serving state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA PETR4.SA. Petrobras is expanding offshore activity as other oil majors kill projects. The highly productive Atlantic fields, known as the pre-salt, guarantee the resilience of long-term projects despite lower oil prices during the coronavirus pandemic, the CEO said. “Multiple opportunities are coming up,” Bischoff said on a videoconference call, citing expected tenders from Petrobras for floating platforms to produce, store and offload oil, known as FPSOs. Ocyan aims to build or operate vessels with capacity to process up to 150,000 barrels per day, bigger than its current FPSOs, he said. The firm also plans to offer maintenance works for the units or operate vessels from other companies, which is the case of a competition by oil producer Enauta. That new business for Ocyan, which now has five drilling ships and two FPSOs, would consolidate a comeback for the firm, known as Odebrecht Oil & Gas until 2018. The company was temporarily blacklisted by Petrobras after the corruption scandal revealed by Operation Car Wash, which began in 2014 to jail scores of politicians and business leaders, including top executives at controller company Odebrecht SA. Brazil went years without new contracts to build platforms as Car Wash forced Petrobras to downsize and stop working with the country’s biggest engineering groups. While producers are cutting or delaying investment, offshore activity in Brazil was steadier than the rest of the world, Bischoff said. In 2019, Ocyan won its first drillship contract with Petrobras after restrictions were lifted. Last week, Petrobras executives said the resumption of platform construction in Brazil would be a decision left for companies which win contracts. The producer declined to comment. “We could participate in more than one competition at a time,” said Bischoff."
-22.49135109172474," Petrobras says ready to launch soy-based renewable diesel upon regulatory approval (Reuters) - Petrobras is ready to produce renewable diesel from soy or other edible oils at commercial scale and will expand investments in the segment as soon as it is granted a sales permit, the company’s refining head, Anelise Lara, told reporters on Friday. Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the company is formally known, is awaiting approval from Brazil’s oil regulator ANP, after the company concluded tests this month. Petrobras refined 2 million liters of soy oil in one of its Southern refineries, resulting in 40 million liters of renewable diesel. “We’ve confirmed the technical viability of the technology,” Lara said. The initiative is part of Petrobras’ climate strategy announced earlier this month, which includes a target to reduce by 16% the carbon intensity in the refining segment in the next five years. Soy is currently the basis of more than 70% of the biodiesel produced in the country. The introduction of a new type of fuel that could affect soy demand is controversial within the industry. Lara said that renewable diesel contains no contaminants, unlike biodiesel, and is therefore better for the environment. But industry group Abiove, which represent biofuel producers, defends biodiesel, saying that it does not contain more contaminants. Renewable diesel and biodiesel have different compositions, including percentages of soy oil."
-23.529411062581524," Brazil's Petrobras forges ahead with downstream, midstream divestments RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian state-run oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro SA expects to conclude negotiations on the sale of its RLAM refinery in northeastern Brazil in the near future and is pushing ahead with the IPO of a gas pipeline unit, executives said on Friday. Speaking to analysts following the release of the company’s second-quarter results, Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco said the firm expects to seal a sale agreement for the refining unit within the next “one to two months.” Abu Dhabi’s investment fund Mubadala Investment Co is in exclusive negotiations with Petrobras, as the Brazilian company is commonly known, after presenting the highest bid for the asset in June. During the same call, Petrobras downstream chief Anelise Lara said Petrobras is pushing ahead with plans announced in 2019 to sell a clutch of offshore natural gas pipelines via an initial public offering. She said the IPO would not occur until 2021, though the company expects to seal an agreement with partners such as Repsol SA and Galp Energia SGPS SA that would be needed to go forward with the deal by the end of the third quarter. Overall, the comments illustrate the bullish position of Petrobras regarding its ambitious divestment program, despite the reduced financial appetite for some assets due to the coronavirus pandemic. Regarding output, Petrobras upstream head Carlos Alberto Pereira de Oliveira reiterated previous assertions that production would be lower in the second half of the year, hit by scheduled maintenance stoppages. He predicted eight such stoppages of approximately 15 days each. After a long tradition of naming its leased platforms after cities, the company has decided to change its naming criteria to honor “national heroes,” the executives said. Two admirals, Almirante Barroso and Almirante Tamandare, are among the names selected by Petrobras for large platforms known as FPSOs. The vessels will be placed in the Buzios field, the world’s largest oil discovery this century. Brazil-listed shares of Petrobras were off 2.3% in afternoon trade, roughly in line with the nation’s benchmark Bovespa equities index."
-26.982382858689608," Brazil's Petrobras posts $500 million loss despite record exports to China RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian state-run oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro SA PETR4.SA on Thursday posted a loss of 2.7 billion reais ($524 million) in the second quarter, hurt by tumbling oil prices despite record export volumes to China. The result, down from a record quarterly profit of 18.9 billion reais a year ago, came as the company pursued an aggressive volume-over-cents strategy to drive sales as crude prices slumped, hitting multi-decade lows in April. In a securities filing, Petrobras, as the firm is known, said its cash generation, or EBITDA, was 24.99 billion reais in the April to June quarter. This was ahead of a Refinitiv consensus estimate of 20.9 billion reais, but the figure was boosted by major non-recurring items, namely a court victory in a major tax dispute, the company said. Without one-off items, EBITDA would have come in at 17.7 billion reais, it said. The swing to a loss illustrates how record exports by Petrobras and fairly steady production levels were not enough to insulate the Rio de Janeiro-based company from the far-reaching effects of the novel coronavirus on the oil industry. “Brent prices of $65 per barrel in February tumbled to $19 per barrel in April 2020 due to a 25% contraction in global demand, threatening a sudden halt to cash flow,” Petrobras Chief Executive Officer Roberto Castello Branco said in a letter to investors. Crude inventories built in the first quarter of the year were sold at a discount in the second quarter, contributing to 1.1 billion reais in losses, the company said. Exports hit a record in terms of volume in April, with more than 1 million barrels a day sold. China was the destination of 87% of the oil. As demand for fuel plummeted, Petrobras strived to place its products in a bid to avoid costly production halts amid a ramp-up plan at highly productive deep-water fields, but revenue figures show it exported at thin margins. Petrobras sales revenue fell more 44% compared to the second quarter of 2019, to 27.7 billion reais."

The remainder of the $380 million will be paid in 18 monthly installments from the transaction’s closing date, Petrobras said. An additional installment of $285 million would be paid through 2026, the filing said. The terms of the deal were changed because of the COVID-19 pandemic, which made it difficult to meet previously agreed conditions."
-18.666664213662482," Brazil's Petrobras kicks off tender to build three FPSOs in deepwater Buzios field SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian state-controlled oil company Petrobras said on Friday it has approved the start of a tender to build three new floating platforms, known as FPSOs, in the Buzios oilfield, one of the biggest deepwater discoveries this century. Earlier in July, Reuters reported that Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the company is formally known, was preparing to launch the leasing tender by the end of August as part of its ambitions plans to boost deepwater production. In a securities filing on Friday, Petrobras said the three new FPSOs were part of its development plans for the asset, which aim at a total of 12 floating platforms installed by the end of the decade. The company currently has four FPSOs operating in Buzios, which correspond to more than 20% of Petrobras’ total production, according to the filing. A fifth floating platform is now under construction and is likely to start production in the second half of 2022. “At the end of the development phase, Buzios field is expected to produce more than 2 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed), becoming Petrobras’ largest production asset,” Petrobras said. An FPSO, or a floating production storage and offloading unit, is effectively a massive ship that is vital for deep water production in some offshore basins."

-20.937946501115416," Coronavirus outbreaks hit quarterly output at Brazil's Petrobras RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Coronavirus outbreaks at a number of platforms operated by Brazil’s Petrobras hit production in the second quarter, the company said on Tuesday, though the firm indicated output may improve in certain regions. In a securities filing, Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the state-controlled company is formally known, said it produced 2.802 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in the second quarter. That was up 6.4% from the same period last year, but down 3.7% from the first quarter. Petrobras produced 2.245 million barrels of crude per day, it said, up 9.4% in annual terms and down 3.2% on a quarterly basis. Petrobras attributed the reduction to the idling of shallow-water platforms, coronavirus outbreaks on offshore facilities and reduced demand. The company had previously announced the plans to hibernate 62 shallow-water platforms, whose lifting costs tend to be relatively high. Among the deepwater platforms that saw production stoppages, Petrobras said, were the Capixaba, the Cidade de Santos, the Cidade de Angra dos Reis and the Cidade de Mangaritiba, all of which experienced outbreaks among workers. In July, Petrobras indicated that output has been strong at its Buzios oilfield, Brazil’s second most productive. Four platforms operating there hit a monthly record of 844,000 boepd, Petrobras said. It also said that demand for certain fuels, such as diesel and gasoline, increased significantly in the quarter as worldwide quarantining orders were loosened. The company said it had resumed full capacity at its largest refinery, the 434,000-barrel-per-day Replan, after shutting down some operations due to the lack of demand for fuels during the pandemic. Petrobras was able to partially offset lower internal consumption in Brazil with higher appetite for its fuels internationally. Petrobras fuel exports rose 22% in the quarter, compared to the first three months of the year."

-14.339517104766916," Brazil's aviation gasoline market disrupted amid quality concerns SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian state-run oil firm Petrobras has “preventively” stopped supplying imported aviation gasoline after chemical tests on an imported batch raised potential issues, a move that caused major fuel distributors BR Distribuidora and Raizen to suspend the sale of the product, according to filings on Monday. Oil multinational BP said in a statement that its aviation fuel unit had immediately suspended sales of aviation gasoline to clients and resellers in Brazil as a precaution after Petrobras’ announcement. Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as Petrobras is formally known, said on Saturday that the batch of imported aviation gasoline, or avgas, complied with the requirements laid out by Brazilian oil regulator ANP. However, internal tests led the company to notice certain chemical differences from other imported avgas batches. “Petrobras is studying the hypothesis that a variation in chemical composition has affected the sealing and lining material in the fuel tanks of small planes,” the company said in a statement, adding that its investigation was preliminary. Petrobras Distribuidora SA, as BR Distribuidora is formally known, is partially owned by Petrobras and is Brazil’s largest fuel distributor. It announced its decision to suspend the supply of avgas on Monday, as did Raizen, a joint venture between Royal Dutch Shell PLC and domestic ethanol producer Cosan SA. On Friday, the ANP and aviation regulator ANAC announced they were creating a working group “to investigate complaints about the quality of aviation gasoline used in the country.” Avgas, unlike jet fuel, is generally used in small aircraft, such as prop planes. Petrobras has imported avgas since 2018 when operations at the President Bernardes Refinery in Sao Paulo state, the unit that produced the fuel, were suspended. The company said in a statement it planned to restart domestic production of avgas in October. It did not specify the size of the batch in which the chemical anomalies were detected."
-14.339517104766916," Brazil's offshore oil workers chilled by coronavirus outbreaks RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - On Friday, May 1, two workers on the PXA-1 offshore platform owned by Brazil’s state-run oil company Petrobras checked into the facility’s infirmary complaining of headaches and fever-like symptoms. Another Petrobras employee fell visibly ill the following day, three workers from the platform told Reuters. The sickness spread further in the subsequent days, stoking anxiety among the 45 workers onboard, all but one of whom later tested positive for the novel coronavirus, according to the local union. While all have since recovered, the three workers, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the media, said they are deeply embittered because they believe Petrobras failed to take now-standard precautions to prevent the spread of the virus, like testing workers before they went onboard rigs or providing them high-quality masks. The three workers and Paolo Valterson, the local union’s health director, questioned why the workers were not evacuated to the nearby city of Fortaleza in northeastern Brazil until four days after the first ones exhibited symptoms. They were quarantined in a hotel in the city for 15 days, according to Valterson. In recent months, Reuters has found, the coronavirus has hit oil production and exposed Petrobras, which employs more than 45,000 people and is Latin America’s largest company by most measures, to possible legal problems. As of mid-June, federal prosecutors had opened 25 coronavirus-related investigations into the Rio de Janeiro-based company’s conduct at maritime facilities alone, according to information obtained through a public information request. Local prosecutors said in a statement they have opened a probe into the incident on the PXA-1 platform. In response to Reuters’ questions about the outbreak and legal investigations, Petrobras said it has been in discussions with authorities to show that its health and safety measures are “among the most rigorous adopted in the oil industry.” The company, formally known as Petroleo Brasileiro SA PETR4.SA, confirmed that a coronavirus outbreak had occurred on the PXA-1 platform, but did not disclose the number of infections. Petrobras told Reuters that all the crew had disembarked from the platform, without specifying a date. The company said it had administered more than 70,000 tests among its employees and subcontractors across the country. But that has not kept the virus from ripping through Brazil’s roughly 155 offshore oil platforms, according to an analysis of public and confidential data and conversations with doctors, workers, executives and government officials. Brazil had registered 1,427 confirmed coronavirus cases among offshore oil workers as of July 10, according to ANP, the country’s oil regulator. That means around 3% of all workers in the sector have contracted the virus, which is about six times the average incidence in Brazil, home to the worst outbreak in Latin America. In a previously undisclosed development, two major oil platforms that are owned by Japanese firm Modec Inc 6269.T and produce oil for Petrobras - the Cidade de Mangaritiba and the Cidade de Angra dos Reis - stopped work in May due to coronavirus outbreaks, ANP told Reuters. Data from the regulator show production at the two platforms in May was down roughly 125,000 barrels per day from February levels, a difference equivalent to 4.5% of Brazil’s total output. Petrobras declined to comment on the incidents. Modec confirmed the production halts, saying they were designed to protect workers. The oil services firm said it strictly controls access to offshore facilities and tests all employees for the coronavirus before they embark. ‘CITIZEN COMPANY’ The spread of the virus in Brazil’s oilfields is a stark reminder of the travails faced by blue-collar workers throughout Latin America. The region has emerged as the one of the world’s worst coronavirus hot spots, with more than 3 million confirmed infections, most of them in Brazil. Among those fortunate enough to have formal work, many toil in cramped facilities, churning out commodities from copper to meat to iron ore or oil. Even as outbreaks have hit slaughterhouses, refineries and mines throughout the region, most of the employees have been deemed essential. Brazilian mining giant Vale SA VALE3.SA and meatpacker JBS SA JBSS3.SA are among the companies that have been dealing with coronavirus outbreaks among their workers. Those who work on offshore oil rigs are particularly susceptible to coming down with COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the virus, because they are aboard for weeks at a time and work, sleep and eat in close contact with one another. Although the United States also has been hard hit by the pandemic, oil companies operating there had identified only 154 coronavirus cases on offshore facilities as of June 29 despite widespread testing, according to the National Ocean Industries Association (NOIA), an industry group. At least six oilfield operators in Brazil have registered cases among employees and contractors, according to three people with knowledge of the firms’ operations, who requested anonymity as they were not authorized to speak to the media. Petrobras is by far the biggest operator locally. Worker complaints vary from outbreak to outbreak, though among the most common qualms is an alleged failure to evacuate rigs promptly. Petrobras said workers who show symptoms aboard a rig are evaluated by a medical team and, if classified as a suspected COVID-19 case, are disembarked. Other workers who have been in very close contact with them are also disembarked, tested and monitored, the company said. Workers also have accused Petrobras of failing until early June to implement universal testing for workers departing to offshore facilities. Union officials consulted by Reuters were particularly irked the firm had donated 600,000 test kits to the federal and state governments by late April, according to company statements, even as union officials had demanded pre-departure tests as early as March, according to correspondence seen by Reuters. Petrobras told Reuters it was one of the first Brazilian companies to begin acquiring test kits, adding that it began rolling out testing for offshore workers on April 20. While originally concentrated in southeastern Brazil, the heart of the country’s oil industry, pre-departure testing later expanded to all parts of Brazil. The company said more than 43% of its direct and indirect workers had been tested as of June 29, adding that the high incidence of coronavirus among offshore oil workers may be partially attributable to higher rates of testing than in Brazil as a whole. Regarding its donations of test kits to federal and state authorities, Petrobras said it considers itself a “citizen company,” and, as such, it is responsible for safeguarding the health of the Brazilian people. The 45 workers on the PXA-1 platform off the coast of Ceara were among those that had not been tested, even as the state and its capital Fortaleza had become one of Brazil’s worst coronavirus hot spots by late April, according to Valterson, the union official. The decades-old platform consists of little more than shared bunk rooms, a dining area, a kitchen, a meeting room and a gym, according to one of the workers who spoke to Reuters. Two workers told Reuters that once onboard the rig they were provided flimsy masks that required self-assembly, with holes in which inserted elastic bands held the face coverings in place. They said masks provided in subsequent weeks were significantly more elaborate. The workers also described significant movement of employees between platforms, which oilfield operators have generally reduced to limit the potential spread of the coronavirus. One employee who said he later tested positive for the virus, a result confirmed by the union, took a boat to a neighboring platform where he was quarantined upon presenting symptoms, two of the other workers said. Petrobras said the workforce on PXA-1 and the neighboring PXA-2 platform had been reduced by half at the time of the outbreak, with only a bare minimum of employees needed for “maintenance and preservation” remaining onboard. The company added that workers had been provided “non-professional-grade” masks that had been approved by work safety officials in Brazil."

With average daily production of 15,000 barrels of oil and 750,000 cubic meters of gas, Golfinho is among the largest production assets Petrobras currently has on the block. Binding offers for the mature oilfield cluster, located off the coast of Brazil’s Espirito Santo state, are due in early September, said the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss confidential matters. Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the state-run firm is formally known, and BW Offshore declined to comment. DBO did not respond to requests for comment. Petrobras is currently selling off an array of assets - from refineries to pipelines to oilfields - in a bid to reduce debt and sharpen its focus on a prolific, deepwater, oil-producing region known as the “pre-salt.” But the crash in crude and fuel prices earlier this year put up significant hurdles to that plan with executives acknowledging it could take longer than initially anticipated for Petrobras to reach its de-leveraging targets. In recent weeks, Petrobras has stepped back on the gas, accepting binding offers for a large refinery in northeastern Brazil in late June, that analysts said could fetch up to $3 billion. Rio de Janeiro-based DBO is composed of Brazilian and Norwegian executives who have extensive experience operating mature assets both in Brazil and in the North Sea, according to the company’s website. The firm lists RWE Supply & Trading, an arm of Germany’s RWE AG, as an investor. BW Offshore became an operator in Brazil in 2019 after regulators approved its $115 million purchase of Petrobras’ Maromba offshore field. The sources said that other firms may also make an offer for Golfinho. While both firms were pre-qualified to make a binding bid, there was no guarantee either company would ultimately do so, the sources added."

-18.577941163246," Petrobras considers LNG units for pre-salt's natural gas: executive RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian state-controlled oil company Petrobras is considering installing offshore units to liquefy the growing natural gas production from the so-called pre-salt area, the company’s emissions and climate change manager said during a webinar on Friday. Liquefied natural gas units could be an alternative for the gas associated with oil produced at the deep-water exploratory region located more than 100 miles off the coast, said Viviana Coelho. It was unclear if a projected program has a timeframe. Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the firm is formally known, currently relies on offshore pipelines to bring natural gas produced offshore to the coast for processing. Lack of infrastructure to ship offshore natural gas to the coast is seen as a possible limitation for rising oil production at the pre-salt, Petrobras has said. The reservoirs, where oil is trapped beneath a thick layer of salt in the Atlantic seabed, have supplied more than 65% of Brazil’s production in just over a decade since their discovery. The rate is expected to keep rising. A small portion of the gas is burned through flaring systems at the platforms. Brazil has strict legislation to limit flaring, and Petrobras wants to reduce its routine flaring emissions to zero by 2030, Coelho said in the presentation. Flaring releases methane, and Petrobras aims to reduce the company’s greenhouse gas emissions by 30% to 50% by 2025, she said. The Brazilian company used 97.6% of its natural gas in May, according to Brazil’s oil regulator. A significant portion is reinjected into the ground to control reservoir pressure and increase oil production, Petrobras said."

-15.541264750656516," Brazil's Petrobras to cut over 20% of workforce in mass downsizing RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Some 10,000 employees of Brazil’s Petrobras, or 22% of its workforce, have accepted voluntary buyouts, Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco said on Wednesday, as the state-run oil company intensifies its quest to slim down and refocus on core businesses. In a webinar hosted by Brazilian newspaper Valor Economico, Castello Branco said the deadline for employees to sign up for the program was Tuesday. Some have already left, while most will leave the company later this year or in 2021. “We have approximately 10,000 people signed up, which means 22% of Petrobras’ employees are going to leave the company,” he said. “Two thousand left over the course of the year. The rest will leave by December, and a smaller part will leave in 2021.” Aided by a massive divestment program which will see employees in many units working for new owners, Petroleo Brasileiro SA PETR4.SA, as the company is formally known, should have about 30,000 employees long-term, versus over 45,000 today, he said. On a separate webinar, Chief Financial Officer Andrea Almeida said Petrobras plans to give more time for potential investors to make offers for the company’s assets, including for its refineries and stakes at its petrochemical and fuel distribution affiliates. The divestment of Petrobras' stake in petrochemical company Braskem SA BRKM5.SA in 2020 would be desirable but ""might not be possible"" as the new coronavirus has changed market conditions, she said. The same applies to its stake in fuel distribution firm Petrobras Distribuidora SA BRDT3.SA, Almeida said, adding that the company plans to have closed part of its refinery sales in 2021. Petrobras received last week binding offers for its Bahia refinery, the first refining unit the state-controlled producer plans to sell. REPAR in southern Parana state will be the next to go to the market in the coming weeks, Castello Branco said. The fuel market is expected to improve in the second half of the year and demand may eventually recover to pre-pandemic levels, but prices are expected to remain lower, Almeida said, adding that Petrobras hit records for crude and fuel exports in May. While demand for gasoline has recovered in past weeks and other fuels are expected to do the same, that does not apply to aviation fuel. “Aviation kerosene hasn’t recovered. That’s a doubt we have, if it will recover like before.”"

Petrobras, as Brazil’s state-controlled oil producer is known, has received at least two offers for the 323,000 barrels per day Landulpho Alves refinery in Bahia, known as Rlam.

It is still unclear if the third pre-qualified group, China’s Sinopec, has also delivered a bid. In a recent note to clients, analysts from Bradesco BBI valued the RLAM refinery, based in the northeastern Brazilian state of Bahia, at $2.5 billion. According to Petrobras’ asset sale rules, the top bidder must enter into an extended round of negotiations, usually lasting several weeks, to finalize contract terms.

If the deal for the Landulpho Alves refinery, also known as RLAM, is concluded, it would mark a first in the producer’s decade-long efforts to end its near-monopoly in refining in Brazil and open one of the top ten fuel markets in the world for private investors. Potential bidders for the refinery in the northeastern state of Bahia include UAE investor Mubadala Investment Co PJSC [MUDEV.UL] and top Chinese state refiner Sinopec, the people said. Indian conglomerate Essar Group, which has exploration operations in its home country and refining and fuel distribution assets in Britain, may also bid for RLAM, two sources said. Essar was initially interested in one of the smaller refineries expected to be sold later this year, according to the sources, that asked for anonymity to disclose private talks. Petrobras, Mubadala and Essar declined to comment by email. Sinopec did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Petrobras, as the producer is known, plans to sell half of its refining capacity, or eight plants, starting with RLAM, Brazil’s first fuel unit ever. Although Petrobras’ monopoly was ended by law two decades ago, the company has retained control of more than 98% of Brazil’s fuel production. The unit has processing capacity of 323,000 barrels per day, or about 14% of Brazil’s total, and will be sold together with pipelines and terminals. The northeastern Brazilian plant, which dates from 1950, requires renovations, according to one of the sources. As social isolation measures have been progressively eased in Brazil’s largest cities, refineries are back to operating close to their regular capacities. Bidders had asked Petrobras for more time earlier this year, as financing became difficult and restrictions on visits due to the COVID-19 pandemic affected due-diligence work, Reuters reported. Two other refineries in Brazil’s southern region, REFAP in Rio Grande do Sul state and REPAR in Parana state, will have deadlines for binding offers in the third quarter, which could be as soon as July, two sources added. Some potential buyers for all three refineries have completed due diligence, two sources said, as financing for acquisitions slowly returns after a dropoff as markets cratered in the initial months of the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic has squeezed the value of refineries, as drivers stayed home, reducing fuel consumption, and oil prices fell. Still, no potential bidders from an initial round of non-binding offers have so far dropped out, one of the sources said."

1.7746368671605555," Exclusive: Petrobras to keep half its office staff at home permanently RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil’s Petrobras has decided to keep half its administrative staff working from home permanently, the company told Reuters, in a dramatic example of how the novel coronavirus has major companies rethinking their use of office real estate. The oil company has sent as much as 90% of its 21,000 administrative staff home since March due to the pandemic. The experience has revealed new opportunities to save costs with office space, Petrobras said in a response to questions. The state-controlled firm, known formally as Petroleo Brasileiro SA PETR4.SA, is the first oil major to plan a widespread and permanent shift to remote work. Producers including Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N, Royal Dutch Shell Plc RDSa.L and BP Plc BP.L have extended their work-from-home periods for most office staff into the foreseeable future but have not made any permanent decisions. Technology companies such as Twitter Inc TWTR.N have been taking the lead on a permanent shift that is gaining traction in other industries as firms seek cost reductions, employee convenience - or both. The shift to permanent work-from-home arrangements will be an opt-in process at Petrobras, according to press officers, but requests from workers so far suggest demand will be high, with more than 10,000 expected to participate. The new policy will not immediately affect operational personnel working outside of administrative offices, such as refinery technicians and platform workers, who are part of a 46,000-strong workforce at Petrobras, excluding subsidiaries. The permanent shift to more remote work is also under consideration for the company’s logistics subsidiary Transpetro, or Petrobras Transporte SA. Petrobras has not set a date to increase staffing in offices and will keep in-site workforce to a minimum for now to reduce health risks during the pandemic, the company said. Workers from at least two departments are discussing a possible rotation system, in which employees would spend one week in the office and one week at home. Petrobras said that is an option under consideration, with no final decision. Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco has been on a crusade to cut costs since he took office in January last year. He announced a $8.1 billion cost-reduction plan through 2023, including dismissal programs and office space reductions. Since then, he has decided to cut back overseas offices to five from 18, shutting locations in New York, Mexico City, Libya, Angola, Nigeria, Tanzania, Iran and Tokyo. Petrobras has been also vacating entire buildings in Rio and Sao Paulo that it does not own. The company decided last year to concentrate employees at its iconic headquarters in downtown Rio, where the cost per desk is cheaper than in rented corporate buildings nearby. Petrobras was one of the first oil majors to cut oil output as the coronavirus pandemic battered global demand. It also booked multibillion-dollar writedowns on assets to reflect lower long-term oil price forecasts, in a move followed by BP on Monday."

42.48041183901893," Petrobras looks to China's 'teapots' to keep oil exports flowing RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil’s state-run Petrobras sees no need for cuts in oil production, executives say, as the market for its crude remains robust in China, while domestic demand for fuel picks up amid social distancing fatigue in Latin America’s largest economy. On a Friday earnings call with analysts, executives credited the company’s strong relationship with independent refineries in China’s Shandong Province, known as “teapots,”’ for allowing Petrobras to export a record amount of crude in recent months, even as some economies are effectively shut. Storage capacity for crude oil and gasoline is not proving to be an issue, they added. Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the firm is formally known, had throttled back oil production by 200,000 barrels per day in early April, or almost 10% of its output, on fears that weak global demand amid the coronavirus pandemic demand would leave the company without places to store crude. Other major oil companies also scaled back production significantly, including Chevron Corp’s cutbacks in the Permian Basin. But within a month Petrobras had reversed its cuts, surprising many. On Thursday night, the company posted margins that beat expectations, even as it took a $11 billion impairment on its exploration and production assets. Executives said on Friday that crude sales to China have been particularly key to bringing Petrobras through the demand crisis caused by the novel coronavirus pandemic, while bunker fuels sales had also remained robust. “Our commercial team has been developing a long-term relationship with Shandong refineries in China where our oil has strong demand even during the crisis,” Chief Logistics Officer André Barreto Chiarini said, citing appetite for the output from four specific offshore oilfields in Brazil. “Crude oil from the Lula, Iracema, Sapinhoa and Buzios fields have the same overall characteristics as specific Chinese oils ... that are experiencing declining production,” he said. He added that Petrobras has capacity to boost oil exports 10% above the April record of 1 million bpd. In a sign that adherence to social distancing measures is slipping from an already low baseline in Brazil, Petrobras downstream chief Anelise Lara told journalists that domestic demand for gasoline and diesel had rebounded significantly from lows in early April. While demand for gasoline had been 65% lower than normal, it is now off only 40% to 45%, she said. Diesel consumption had fallen 50%, but is now only 30% off normal levels. The company expects demand for all products except jet fuel to return to near-normal levels in the third or fourth quarter, Lara added. Executives also said they would dramatically reduce the company’s real estate footprint to cut costs. The home office regime adopted by the company during the pandemic showed that 50% of office workers could effectively work from home permanently, Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco said. Brazil-listed preferred shares in Petrobras were down 0.1% in afternoon trade, while Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa equities index fell over 1%."

42.48041183901893," Brazil's Petrobras warns economy has changed forever as it books massive impairment RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil’s Petrobras took a 65.3 billion real ($11.2 billion) impairment on its exploration and production assets on Thursday, warning investors that changes in consumer behavior resulting from the coronavirus pandemic would likely be permanent. The impairment led Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the firm is formally known, to book a first-quarter net loss of 48.5 billion reais. The company wrote off the entire value of its shallow-water assets, and said it did not expect to resume production at six high-cost production assets currently for sale. Total impairments came to 57.6 billion reais for its deepwater assets, including the massive Marlim Sul oilfield, and 6.6 billion reais at its shallow-water fields. Other unspecified assets comprised the remaining 1.1 billion reais of writedowns. The impairment served as a warning by the state-run oil giant that the oil market may never recover following the novel coronavirus pandemic, even as some major economies are already attempting to tiptoe back to normality following widespread lockdowns. The company is now assuming long-term Brent prices of $50 per barrel, versus a previous assumption of $65, it said in its first-quarter results statement. The company projected that 2020 Brent prices would average $25 a barrel before increasing $5 every year until they reach $50 in 2025. It added that it was now revising all exploration and production projects to make sure they make economic sense given the new pricing assumptions. “The company expects a lower level of demand in the long term, taking into account ... structural change in the world economy, with permanent effects arising from this economic shock, including changes observed in consumer habits,” Petrobras said. Petrobras reported recurring earnings, before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, adjusted for some one-off factors, of 36.9 billion reais. That figure was significantly above the Refinitiv consensus estimate of 32.9 billion reais. The company said its first-quarter results were not significantly affected by the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic, which would only be meaningfully felt in coming quarters. It added that it benefited from continued strong exports of crude and bunker fuel, a product used by ships. In comments accompanying the results, Petrobras Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco noted the company’s debt increased “only $2.1 billion” in the quarter, despite adverse market conditions. He added that the company’s ambitious divestment program was still intact, although it may suffer delays. Its sale of eight refineries, by far the largest ongoing divestment, is still going forward. “In particular, we are confident that at least a significant part of the refinery sales shall have purchase-and-sale contracts concluded by the end of 2020,” he said."

37.35303777320358," Petrobras again delays Garoupa oilfield offer as faces new setbacks: sources RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Petrobras has delayed the submission of binding offers for an oilfield cluster known as Polo Garoupa for a fourth time, two sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters, as investor appetite in Brazil’s offshore oil sector rapidly dries up. With annual production of 19,600 barrels of oil equivalent per day according to bidding documents released last year by the state-run oil company, Garoupa is the largest production asset in Petrobras’ expansive divestment portfolio. While a number of potential buyers took an initial look at it, including Brazil’s Petro Rio SA , Anglo-French firm Perenco and British-based Premier Oil PLC, current low oil prices make the shallow water fields an increasingly hard sell, said the sources, who requested anonymity as they are bound by confidentiality agreements. Even before oil prices crashed amid worldwide coronavirus quarantine measures, the asset was considered complex, due to high decommissioning costs and challenging geology, the sources added. Binding offers were originally due in early December, but were postponed to March, then late April. They have been postponed again until May 21, the sources said. In April, Garoupa - as well as all other shallow-water clusters owned by Petrobras, which tend to have relatively high lifting costs - was idled. One of the sources said that measure was a further setback for the sale process, as significant idling time can cause offshore infrastructure to require large amounts of maintenance when restarted. At least three companies that took an initial look at the asset have since formally dropped out, including energy-focused U.S. private equity firm EIG Global Energy Partners. Many of the small and medium oil independents that have been frequent bidders for Petrobras’ production assets have seen their cash positions deteriorate rapidly in recent months. Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as Petrobras is formally known, did not respond to a request for comment, nor did Perenco, Petro Rio or Premier. EIG declined to comment. Reuters reported last week that Petrobras had postponed a plan to sell a piece of its much larger Marlim cluster due to challenging market conditions."
37.35303777320358," Exclusive: Lack of financing for buyers may extend delay in Petrobras refineries bids - sources SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Lack of financing for the buyers of Brazil's Petroleo Brasileiro SA PETR4.SA refineries may extend the delay in the sale process, three people with knowledge of the matter said. Petrobras, as the company is known, had already extended the deadline for delivery of binding offers for the eight largest, first lot of refineries from early April to early June, following a plunge in oil prices. Petrobras referred to the latest filing postponing the bids, in which it didn’t´t give a new firm deadline. But at the time, sources with knowledge of the matter said the bidders were given additional 30 to 60 days to deliver the binding offers. Now, the groups interested in acquiring the refineries are facing tougher financing conditions for their bids, that may be worth more than $10 billion. Banks are more reluctant to finance deals in the refining business due to uncertainty over fuel demand. Ultrapar Participações SA UGPA3.SA, Raizen - a joint venture between Cosan SA and Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L, United Arab Emirates' state investor Mubadala Investment Company and China's Sinopec presented non-binding offers in the first phase of the sale process. So far, Petrobras has not changed is still officially keeping the deadline and committing to a sale this year, but the lack of financing may force the company to postpone it again. Field visits for due diligence in the refineries have also become more difficult due to the risk of the spread of the novel coronavirus, adding to reasons for another extension in the long-awaited sale process. Earlier this year, before the pandemic, U.S. major Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N was in talks to join one bidder group, two people with knowledge of matter said. But the company reported a loss in the first quarter and cut expenses and expansion projects. Exxon declined to comment. Petrobras has faced challenges in its bid to reduce debt, which was at $87.1 billion at the end of 2019, after oil demand plunged amid worldwide social distancing measures and lockdowns. Earlier in April, the company scrapped its 2020 debt reduction target due to market volatility."

The state-owned firm, formerly known as Petroleo Brasileiro S.A., cited current costs, expenses and volatile oil prices but did not provide further details about its current cash burn rate or the projected stress scenarios. The statement was published in response to press reports of an internal event in which finance and investor relations director Andrea de Almeida said that the company could be spending $1 billion of cash per month.

37.462864355094815," Exclusive: Brazil's Petrobras puts brakes on massive oilfield sale - sources RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil’s Petrobras has put the sale of a massive cluster of offshore oilfields on ice, three sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters this week, underlining the challenges the state-run oil company faces in its bid to reduce debt amid the novel coronavirus pandemic. Petrobras began preparations earlier this year to sell a minority stake in the coveted Marlim cluster off the coast of Rio de Janeiro, said the sources, who requested anonymity to describe private conversations. But it opted to shelve the project after oil demand plunged amid worldwide quarantine measures, the people added. Petrobras Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco said in December the company believed the firm could fetch $2 to $4 billion for a piece of Marlim. But that was before the current demand crisis, which has persisted even after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries slashed production. “With oil at its current levels, it doesn’t make sense to discuss such an interesting asset,” said a source with direct knowledge of the matter. “When it can be sold depends on when prices come back. The idea (of selling) didn’t die.” Over the last two years, Petrobras has been selling off dozens of assets - ranging from oilfields in Nigeria to a refinery in Texas - in a bid to reduce its hefty debt load, which stood at $87.1 billion at the end of 2019. The sale of Marlim, however, would represent a doubling down of that strategy. While most of the oilfields Petrobras has sold so far produce less than 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), the four oilfields comprising the Marlim cluster produced about 243,000 boepd according to March data from Brazilian regulator ANP. That’s equivalent to nearly 10% of the company’s total output. Crucially, some of that production is in Brazil’s so-called pre-salt, a promising subsea geological formation where billions of barrels of oil are trapped beneath a layer of salt under the ocean floor. Petrobras has not sold any pre-salt assets since 2016 when France’s Total SA agreed to buy a piece of the Lapa field and Iara prospect as well as stakes in two powerplants in a deal worth over $2 billion. Its latest comparably sized oilfield sale occurred in 2017 when it agreed to sell a 25% stake in its legacy Roncador field to Norway’s Equinor ASA for $2.9 billion. Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as Petrobras is formally known, declined to comment. Executives have floated the possibility of selling a chunk of Marlim before. From 2017 to 2019, Petrobras held ultimately unsuccessful talks with China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) about handing over a 20% stake in the cluster in a deal that would have seen CNPC become a partner at Petrobras’ Comperj, a financially troubled petrochemical complex near Rio de Janeiro. Castello Branco, speaking at Petrobras’ December Investor Day, said it might consider selling a piece of Marlim - which he pegged at up to $4 billion - and the much smaller Papa-Terra oilfield. In February, Petrobras and partner Chevron Corp, put Papa-Terra on the block. Petrobras executives have insisted in recent weeks that it still sees strong appetite for the assets it is selling. However, executives have also acknowledged that debt reduction has become more difficult given current market conditions. In late April, the company scaled back its 2020 debt reduction target."

40.644981499956586," Brazil's Petrobras revises debt outlook amid lower crude prices RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil’s Petrobras has scrapped its 2020 debt reduction target due to market volatility, the state-run oil firm said in a securities filing on Tuesday, a widely expected move that underlines the significant challenges it faces. Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the firm is formally known, is now seeking to end 2020 with $87 billion in gross debt, the same level as it ended 2019, according to the filing. Previously, the company said it was planning to end 2020 with a ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of 1.5. That would have represented a sharp fall from the current level of around 2.4, and its success was dependent on a steady flow of divestments by Petrobras, which is selling an array of refineries and oilfields. However, swings in Brent crude prices, which serves as the benchmark for Brazilian oil, has made net debt an extremely volatile metric, the firm said. Low oil prices have also tempered demand for assets Petrobras has on the block, while some sale processes have already been formally delayed. “The approved gross debt target for 2020 is $87 billion, the same level as the end of 2019, due to the current adverse global market environment,” the company said in the filing. Petrobras Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco had repeatedly warned that the company’s debt reduction target might be too ambitious given current oil market conditions, calling the possibility of reaching its target a “question mark” in a March interview with CNN."

56.46368628128283," Petrobras reverses production cuts as fuel demand beats expectations RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian state-run oil firm Petrobras has reversed most of its previously announced production cuts due to higher-than-expected demand for some fuels, it said on Monday, a surprising turnaround that may be tied to an aggressive bet on bunker fuel. In a Monday securities filing with first-quarter production figures, Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the firm is formally known, noted that it initially decided to cut April oil production to 2.07 million barrels per day (bpd). But it said it decided later in the month to increase production to 2.26 million bpd. It also increased utilization rates at its refineries to 79% after cutting them to 60%. The reversal suggests Petrobras is confident in demand for its production mix even as rival oil majors scale back and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries orchestrates deep cuts in the face of rock-bottom oil prices. “With demand for our products proving better than expected, we opted to gradually return average production to around 2.26 million bpd in April, while also increasing utilization rates at refineries,” the company said. In late March and early April, the firm had announced total cuts of 200,000 bpd. Oil production averaged 2.32 million bpd of oil in the first three months of the year. While Petrobras did not say which fuels were most in demand in April, company executives have made a priority of producing bunker fuel, which is used by ships. First-quarter production of bunker and other fuel oils by Petrobras rose 18.5% from the previous quarter and almost 50% from the same period a year before. New international regulations that came into force at the beginning of the year lowered the maximum allowed sulfur content of bunker fuels. Much of the oil produced by Petrobras is naturally low in sulfur, making it ideal for bunker production. Executives have repeatedly said demand for bunker fuel appears more resilient during the novel coronavirus pandemic than demand for other products, such as gasoline and jet fuel. Including natural gas and other petroleum products, Petrobras produced 2.909 million barrels of oil equivalent per day in the first quarter, down 3.8% from the previous quarter and up 14.6% from the same period a year before. The firm said its results were helped by various platforms coming online and negatively impacted by a number of scheduled stoppages.

Petrobras Exploration and Production Director Carlos Alberto de Oliveira said operations at the Cidade de Santos should restart over the weekend, and operations at the Capixaba should restart within 10 days. Both are large ships known as FPSOs. Brazil’s offshore oil industry has been hit hard by the novel coronavirus.

Oliveira did not specify how much production may have been lost after the two FPSOs were evacuated earlier this month. The FPSO Capixaba, owned by Petrobras contractor SBM Offshore NV, was responsible for roughly 14,400 barrels per day of oil production according to the most recent data collated by the ANP, Brazil’s oil regulator. The Cidade de Santos, owned by Japanese oil services firm Modec Inc, was responsible for about 16,900 bpd of production, according to ANP data. Petrobras is already in the process of cutting its production by 200,000 bpd as the coronavirus outbreak has pummeled demand.

The impact on the company’s finances will be felt over the course of three years, Petrobras said in the filing.

47.22223632799747," Petrobras says talks among Russia, Saudi Arabia, U.S. 'irrelevant' for oil prices RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Recent negotiations involving leaders from major oil-producing nations and the United States will prove irrelevant for oil prices, which are low because of depressed demand, the chief executive of Brazil’s Petrobras said on Thursday evening. During an online event hosted by Brazilian brokerage XP, Petrobras CEO Roberto Castello Branco said the dispute between non-OPEC member Russia and the group’s de facto leader, Saudi Arabia, showed that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries had no medium- or long-term pricing power. “I sincerely think that this dispute between Russia and Saudi Arabia - although the markets reacted positively to some news about President Trump getting involved and what not - has become irrelevant amid the dimension of the (coronavirus) crisis,” Castello Branco said. “Oil prices are low because global demand has gone down.” Castello Branco’s comments may temper speculation that Brazil will enter a potential deal among oil-producing nations to stabilize the oil market. Still, Brazilian Energy Ministry officials have remained silent on any potential negotiations. Petrobras and government officials say the company is run without any political interference, although the government is by far the biggest shareholder in Petroleo Brasileiro SA PETR4.SA, as the firm is known. Government and company officials are known to communicate frequently. Crude prices </LCOo1> crashed in early March as talks between Russia and Saudi Arabia fell apart. Demand has since taken a severe hit as the economies of many countries have ground to a halt amid efforts to battle the global coronavirus outbreak. Brent oil prices and U.S. benchmark WTI both rose over 20% on Thursday after U.S. President Donald Trump said he brokered a deal between Russia and Saudi Arabia to cut supply. But the details of any potential accord remained unclear. Officials in other oil-producing nations, including Mexico, signaled an openness to multilateral talks to stabilize oil prices. Castello Branco also discussed a recent move by Petrobras to cut production by 200,000 barrels per day, or about 6% of output. If the company did not curb output, it would have had to charter ships to store the oil because of a lack of demand, he said."

The memo fleshed out aspects of an austerity plan that Petrobras announced a day earlier. As part of that plan, the company said Transpetro, which operates almost 5,000 miles of pipelines and has a fleet of over 50 ships, would reduce or delay payments of 507 million reais ($96 million). The memo said 205 million reais in savings would come from operational expenses, such as “renegotiating contracts” and “optimizing assets, eventually with the suspension of certain services/assets.” Transpetro is also looking at “returning buildings” and increasing “remote work.” Transpetro plans to save 175 million reais by postponing some investments, the memo said, such as maintenance at storage tanks and other facilities. It will also save 246 million reais in human resources costs, by postponing compensation and training, among other measures. Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the parent company is formally known, did not respond to a request for comment, nor did Transpetro. Crude prices have crashed this year as Saudi Arabia and Russia battle for dwindling sales in a market battered by the coronavirus pandemic. Petrobras is among a number of oil companies that have throttled back operational and capital expenditures, and in some cases production. The Transpetro memo highlighted several short-term actions Petrobras has taken to ensure its financial health, but said that additional measures were needed. “A scenario with Brent at $25 per barrel and a 5 reais to the dollar exchange rate could cause (Petrobras) to lack resources/liquidity in the short-term,” the memo said.

56.192243451731585," Petrobras deepens oil supply cuts for 'worst oil industry crisis in 100 years' RIO DE JANEIRO/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil’s Petrobras will double its oil output cuts to 200,000 barrels per day, or about 6% of total production, and shorten work hours as the state-controlled company responds to what its chief executive has called the “worse oil industry crisis in 100 years.” Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the company is formally known, said in a filing that it is also deferring the payment of 10% to 30% of the salaries of managers and cutting work hours to six from eight hours per day for 21,000 employees, among other cost saving measures. Crude oil prices have crashed by around 60% year to date as Saudi Arabia and Russia battle for their share of a market that has also been battered by the coronavirus pandemic. Last week, Petrobras announced a production cut of 100,000 bpd, reduced capital expenditure plans and postponed dividend payments in response to flagging crude prices. At the time, the company said it would cut production in part by idling shallow-water fields. In the Wednesday announcement, Petrobras did not say where the additional production cuts would be concentrated, noting only that it would depend on “operational and market conditions.” Petrobras is among several major oil companies that are throttling back investments, operational expenditures and in some cases production as crude prices fall below the breakeven price of some fields. Among the companies that have cut production is Chevron Corp, which slashed its 2020 production forecast in the Permian Basin by 20%. Joint ventures between the U.S. company and Venezuela’s state-run PDVSA have canceled service contracts and procurement processes in recent weeks. On Wednesday, Petrobras also said it would reduce its refineries’ production but did not specify by how much, as lockdowns in Brazil’s largest cities curb demand. Petrobras and its subsidiaries are also cutting costs, the filing said. Its Transpetro midstream subsidiary expects to reduce or postpone payments totaling 507 million reais ($97 million).

50.36363688163639," UPDATE 1-Brazil's Bovespa: World's worst-performing major stock market in first quarter (Recasts, adds quote, charts) BRASILIA, March 31 (Reuters) - Brazilian stocks plunged 51% in the January-March period measured in dollar terms, making the benchmark Bovespa index the world’s worst-performing major equity market in the first quarter, according to Reuters/Refinitiv calculations. The extraordinary fall was down to a double-whammy of heavy selling, along with markets around the world as the hit to growth and earnings from coronavirus became apparent, and a 22% fall in the real’s exchange rate. The collapse in oil prices also played a part in the Bovespa’s performance, as preferred shares in oil giant Petrobras sank 56% in the first quarter. And that was in local currency terms. In local currency terms, the benchmark Bovespa index closed the month of March down 30%, the biggest monthly fall since August 1998. It fell 37% over the first quarter period, its steepest quarterly plunge since at least 1994. The second-biggest declining equity market was Argentina’s, which fell 46% in dollar terms, followed by Greece, according to Reuters/Refinitiv calculations. The Bovespa closed 2.1% lower on Tuesday at 73,086 points. The real, supported by a $755 million sale of spot market dollars at auction by the central bank, closed at 5.1950 per dollar, meaning it depreciated by 22.5% in the first quarter of the year. That marks the currency’s biggest quarterly fall since 2002, and there might be even further to go. “In a worst-case scenario where current account funding dries up for a long time, most deficit currencies still have major downside,” Bank of America Merrill Lynch analysts wrote in a note on Tuesday. “For example, the Brazilian real ... would need to be another 20% cheaper to balance (the) current account,” they said. The central bank has now sold over $12 billion in spot market intervention currency auctions so far this year, and has also sold dollars via FX swaps and credit line auctions."

In a statement, Petroleo Brasileiro SA said three ships are on their way to Brazil loaded with LPG, each with a capacity of 20 million kilograms (20,000 tonnes), equal to 1.6 million canisters used in homes. The first is scheduled to arrive on Monday, while the other two are due April 6 and 10, Petrobras said. “There is no need to store LPG, as there will be no shortage of supply for the population.” The company also reduced the average price of the 13kg LPG canisters used in kitchens across the country by 10% to 21.85 reais ($4.21). “Petrobras is counting on distributors and resellers to ensure that these price reductions are passed onto customers,” it said.

38.20997310203965," Petrobras' divestment push in Brazil challenged by oil price war RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - A move by Brazil’s Petrobras on Thursday to slash output, capital spending and dividends brings the state-run oil firm into alignment with global rivals confronted with a global pandemic and a plunge in crude prices. But a cloud remains over the company’s ambitious divestment drive, which is a key element of the current management’s strategy. Petrobras has thrilled investors over the last two years with its rapid-fire sale of dozens of non-core assets, as the company’s management pushes to drive down debt. But the oil crash has put the brakes on that ambitious divestment push for now and some already announced deals could fall apart, according to several industry sources. Brazil-listed preferred shares in Petroleo Brasileiro SA PETR4.SA, as the firm is formally known, are off over 50% this year, among the worst performers of all major, publicly listed oil companies. Part of that drop is due to a general aversion to emerging market assets. But difficulty cutting debt certainly does not help, analysts say. With $78.9 billion of net debt as of the fourth quarter, the company is sitting on one of the highest debt loads of all oil firms, equivalent to 2.41 times its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA). Petrobras’ formal goal is to reduce that ratio to 1.5 by the end of 2020. Soon after he was appointed in January 2019, Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco even said the firm could reduce that ratio to 1 by aggressively selling off assets like refineries, pipelines and legacy oilfields. Petrobras last year sold a bevy of assets including a major pipeline network and a stake in Brazil’s largest gas station chain. But last week the company postponed by two months the sale of eight domestic refineries, a process set to rake in several billion dollars. At least one oilfield sale has also been pushed back, according to two sources familiar with the matter. That has helped puncture some of the previous optimism surrounding the Brazilian oil behemoth. “Previously, we viewed these (debt reduction) targets as feasible, if not a stretch, given the quick progress on asset sales and higher oil prices,” analysts from Morningstar said in a note published on Wednesday. “However, the recent decline in oil prices means the company is unlikely to reach its debt targets this year while asset sales might slow.” In a conference call with investors on Thursday, executives played down the risks to their divestment program. Branco added, however, that the firm will not sell assets if offers come in below what the company considers to be fair valuations. The oil price shock is not considered a dealbreaker for the refinery sales, in part because buyers are more concerned about crack spreads - or the difference in price between crude and refined products - than oil prices. Anelise Lara, Petrobras’ downstream chief, said she does not believe current oil prices and demand issues will affect prices for eight refineries the company has on the block. But sources at two potential buyers have said they were at the least taking another look at their pricing assumptions. Upstream deals are more at risk. Binding offers for one mid-sized offshore oilfield that Petrobras is selling, Polo Garoupa, have been postponed until late April from early March, according to two sources with knowledge of the matter. Several industry sources in Rio de Janeiro also raised concerns about the roughly $2.75 billion of divestments classified as “signed” but not “closed” by Petrobras as of February. At least one of the larger oilfields that fall into that category was purchased by a buyer still lining up financing. Australia's Karoon Energy Ltd KAR.AX, which announced the purchase of Petrobras' Bauna field in July for $655 million, recently said it would no longer complete the expected loan package in the first quarter. “Karoon is always looking to create value wherever it can be found for its investors and we will work through the current environment in an attempt to complete this acquisition,” Robert Hosking, Karoon’s managing director, said in a statement released earlier in March."
38.20997310203965," Brazil's Petrobras cuts production, capex amid coronavirus outbreak RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil’s Petrobras said on Thursday it would cut oil production by 100,000 barrels per day, or around 3%, making it the first major state-run oil company to announce a significant reduction in output in response to the coronavirus pandemic. In a securities filing, Petroleo Brasileiro SA PETR4.SA, as the firm is formally known, said it also delayed a dividend payment and slashed 2020 investments by nearly a third to $8.5 billion. While the production cut only lasts until the end of March and is relatively small for Petrobras, which produced over 3 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in the fourth quarter, the firm left the door open to further reductions as it monitors the market. As part of those cuts, the firm will idle some shallow-water platforms with higher production costs, which are responsible for 23,000 barrels per day (bpd) of output. Petrobras' capex reduction comes after various other major oil companies, including Chevron Corp CVX.N, announced similar measures. Crude oil prices have crashed by 60% since January as Saudi Arabia and Russia battled for their share of a market that has already slumped and seen demand shrink amid the coronavirus pandemic. Demand worldwide is expected to fall by more than 12 million bpd, or more than 10% of daily demand. Petrobras did not announce any changes to plans to sell $20 billion to $30 billion in assets by 2024 in a bid to reduce debt, a key component of its five-year business plan. On a conference call with investors and analysts on Thursday, Petrobras Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco said he had not received any indication that there was less demand among potential buyers for Petrobras assets. Downstream Chief Anelise Lara added that she did not believe that recent market developments would affect the prices of eight refineries the firm is selling, a process expected to fetch several billion dollars. Executives said they were renegotiating contracts with service firms and analyzing potential changes to individual investments on a daily basis. But, they added, they were reticent about making long-term adjustments given ongoing market uncertainties. Still, Castello Branco said the company was not forecasting a “significant recovery” in oil prices barring some unforeseen event. In its Thursday filing, Petrobras also said it was delaying a 1.7 billion-real ($336 million) dividend payment scheduled for May 20 until Dec. 15. Its next general shareholders meeting is set to be delayed by three days, from April 24 to April 27. In addition to capex cuts, the firm is also cutting 2 billion reais in operational expenditures in the short term by suspending new contracting processes for 90 days, among other measures. Petrobras also said it is drawing $700 million from its revolving credit lines, in addition to the $8 billion it said it would draw last week.

27.961423964723053," UPDATE 2-Brazil's Petrobras shares slump as oil rout casts doubt on strategy (Adds analyst comment, background, updates market prices) RIO DE JANEIRO, March 9 (Reuters) - Shares in Brazil’s state-controlled Petroleo Brasileiro SA plunged by nearly a third on Monday following a severe slump in international oil prices that could squeeze earnings and throw up barriers to planned asset sales. The global rout, triggered by decisions by Saudi Arabia and Russia to hike output despite declining demand as the new coronavirus spreads, has hit oil producers worldwide. For Petrobras, which saw some 94.3 billion reais ($19.8 billion) in market value evaporate, the price plunge could cause complications for Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco’s plan to sell $20 billion to $30 billion of assets by 2024. The company plans to cut its diesel and gasoline selling prices to distributors in response to the rout, a source with knowledge of the matter said, without specifying by how much. Petrobras said in a statement that it would maintain its strategic plan for now, but that it was monitoring the oil market. It did not comment on the possibility of price cuts. “Obviously, (the market rout) isn’t good for Petrobras given that it has this policy of aggressive asset sales and many of the candidates to buy them may want to put off making decisions,” said Helder Queiroz, a professor at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and former director at Brazil’s National Petroleum Agency (ANP). In particular, he cited the company’s plan to sell eight refineries spread around Brazil. At the same time, analysts noted that Petrobras has made strides in cutting its still hefty $79 billion debt load. “It still has a very high debt level,” said Adriano Pires, director of the Brazilian Infrastructure Center. “That’s why it has to continue cutting costs, invest in what provides good returns, exercise capital discipline, keep prices aligned with international levels, and divest assets.” “It is a company which is far from being healthy but it’s on the right path.” The company has been seeking to sharpen its focus on Brazil’s deepwater “pre-salt” area, a geological formation where billions of barrels of oil are trapped underneath a layer of salt beneath the ocean floor. Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro wrote on Twitter that the government would not interfere with Petrobras’ pricing policy, but that the trend will be for lower prices at refineries.

The court said the case related to payments worth more than $35 million made between 2007 and 2014 via mediators in Switzerland and Brazil to Petrobras employees. It did not specify on whose behalf the payments were made. “The judge pronounces Bernardo Schiller Freiburghaus guilty of complicity in bribing foreign agents, of aggravated money laundering in Switzerland and Brazil, and regular money laundering in Switzerland and Portugal,” the ruling said. He was handed a suspended 16-month custodial sentence and ordered to pay 1.6 million Swiss franc ($1.64 million) in fines and to pay trial costs, the judgment said. “My client is happy to have turned the page and to resume a normal life,” said his lawyer, Christian Luscher, adding that the sentence was expected and that there would be no appeal. Swiss federal prosecutors in October pressed charges against the Swiss-Brazilian dual national in the probe of Petrobras and construction firm Odebrecht, seeking a quick conclusion. The Petrobras-Odebrecht case has led to around 60 criminal proceedings in Switzerland, while more than 130 businessmen and politicians have been convicted in the case in Brazil. The Swiss attorney general has seized assets in Switzerland worth more than 620 million Swiss francs and returned around 390 million francs to the Brazilian authorities."

-51.45833374139329," Brazil's Petrobras girds for headwinds after posting record profit RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Oil exports by Petrobras should fall slightly in the first quarter and production is already taking a hit, due to scheduled maintenance stoppages, executives said on Thursday, a sign the Brazilian state-run oil firm may have to endure some short-term pains to consolidate long-term gains. On a conference call to discuss Petrobras’ fourth-quarter results, executives said that January production was little changed from December at around 3 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), but February production was feeling the effects of the stoppages. Petroleo Brasileiro SA PETR4.SA, as the firm is formally known, is undergoing an ambitious maintenance program at many of its platforms this year, including in the so-called ""pre-salt,"" a prolific and profitable deepwater formation. The effects of coronavirus are also having an effect on the firm. While executives said there has been no impact on deliveries to China, Petrobras downstream chief Anelise Lara noted that prices for products such as bunker fuel have taken a hit. Petrobras is making a concerted push to up its sales of bunker fuel, which is used for ships, as new international regulations strictly limit the sulfur content of the fuel. As Brazilian oil is naturally low in sulfur, executives have said they may be in a position to benefit. “We noticed a decrease in crack spreads for bunker in relation to what we were seeing in December, for example,” said Lara, referring to the difference between bunker prices and crude prices. “We came to see bunker prices in Singapore around fuel oil prices, which has never happened in history.” On Wednesday evening, Petrobras posted a record 2019 profit, though quarterly results were fairly average. Brazil-listed preferred shares in the firm were down 2.4% in early afternoon trade, while the Brazil's benchmark Bovespa equities index .BVSP was down 1.7%. “I COULD BE A BILLIONAIRE” In discussions with analysts and journalists, Petrobras Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco also took a veiled jab at rivals including BP PLC BP.L, which earlier this month announced a goal to achieve zero net emissions by 2050. Such long-term targets, he argued, are impossible to enforce, especially given that the company's administration is likely to turn over several times in that period. “I could announce various goals for 2050, such as that I could be a billionaire,” Castello Branco said, when asked about the firm’s long-term environmental targets. Petrobras has repeatedly said it is laser-focused on oil production, and has no expertise in renewable energy. The company announced in late January that it was selling its piece of a large wind farm in northern Brazil.

-51.45833374139329," Brazil's Petrobras hits all-time profit record in 2019 RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian state-run oil firm Petrobras missed fourth-quarter expectations, but posted a record profit for 2019, as the firm’s strategy of focusing on deepwater production and exiting non-core activities shows signs off paying off. In a securities filing on Wednesday, Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the company is formally known, said full-year 2019 profit came to 40.1 billion reais ($9.19 billion), the highest figure ever. However, Petrobras underperformed analysts’ expectations in the fourth quarter. The company posted a quarterly net income of 8.15 billion reais, significantly below some analysts’ expectations, as the firm was dogged by impairments and an increase in administrative costs. Analysts at Brazilian investment bank BTG Pactual had estimated the firm would report a net income of 9.09 billion reais. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) were 36.5 billion reais in the quarter, which was also at the low end of analysts’ estimates. The firm registered 6.59 billion reais in impairments due to revisions to Brent oil price forecasts, as well as a 2.2 billion-real impairment at its RNEST refinery due to construction delays General and administrative expenses also shot up significantly due to what the company called an “internal reclassification of costs.” Still, investors have shown a willingness to forgive one-off charges, as Petrobras’ current administration continues to deliver relatively healthy margins and invest in promising offshore oilfields. Exploratory costs shot up in the fourth quarter, pressuring profits, but also signaling the company is aggressively moving ahead with its focus on offshore oil exploration and production. One bright spot was an increase in top-line revenue for the oil firm to 37.1 billion reais from 30 billion reais the previous quarter. The firm said higher Brent prices boosted revenue. Petrobras added that its board approved the distribution of 2.5 billion reais in dividends to ordinary shareholders and 1.7 million reais in dividends to preferred shareholders. Last week, the firm said it hit a new production record in the fourth quarter, thanks largely to the ramp-up of platforms in the so-called “pre-salt” offshore oil formation."

-54.44444033361822," Brazil's Petrobras hits new production record amid 'pre-salt' boom RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil’s Petrobras hit a new production record in the fourth quarter, of over 3 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), thanks largely to the ramp-up of platforms in the prolific pre-salt formation, the state-run oil firm said on Monday. In a securities filing, Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the company is formally known, said it produced 3.025 million boepd, up 5.1% from the third quarter and 13.7% from the fourth quarter last year. In December, the company said, it hit 3.8 million boepd, an all-time monthly record for the firm. In the filing, the company attributed the monthly records to the ramp-up of several platforms, including the P-67 and P-69 platforms in the Lula field. More generally, the company has benefited from a shift in focus to the offshore “pre-salt” formation, where billions of barrels of oil are located beneath a layer of salt under the ocean floor. Oil and natural gas production in the pre-salt reached 1.533 million barrels per day (bpd) in the fourth quarter, the company said, up 12.1% from the third quarter and up some 46.4% from the year-ago period. In the filing, Petrobras maintained its guidance for 2020 production at 2.7 million boepd. The firm has said that reflects expected maintenance stoppages and sagging production at some legacy fields, though the market widely viewed that production target as surprisingly low when it was divulged in November, given the company’s current output. Petrobras produced an average of 2.77 million boepd in 2019, up 5.4% from 2018. As in previous quarters, production at onshore and shallow-water fields, as well as deepwater “post-salt” fields, fell sharply, thanks to divestments and a shift in investments to the pre-salt. Post-salt oil production fell 14.2% in the fourth quarter from the year-ago period to 680 million bpd, while shallow-water production fell 29.8% to 59 million bpd."

-54.488510885524235," Exclusive: First Petrobras employee flips in Brazil commodity traders probe RIO DE JANEIRO/HOUSTON (Reuters) - A former trader at oil firm Petrobras has signed a plea bargain agreement with Brazilian prosecutors investigating bribery allegations, defense lawyers and prosecutors said, a potential breakthrough in a case involving some of the world’s top commodity trading houses. Rodrigo Garcia Berkowitz, who was a trader at Petrobras’ Houston office until he was charged with accepting bribes in late 2018, reached the deal in principle in December, the lawyers said. A judge then approved it in late January, they added. He is the first former Petrobras employee known to have formally flipped in the Brazilian bribery and corruption probe. Prosecutors alleged in December 2018 that Vitol, Glencore Plc and Trafigura, among other trading firms, funneled tens of millions of dollars of bribes from 2011 to at least 2014 to employees of state-run Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as Petrobras is formally known. In return, those firms would purchase Petrobras fuel at discounts or sell to the firm at a premium. Two of Berkowitz’s defense lawyers spoke to Reuters on Monday. Federal prosecutors in Brazil also confirmed the deal to Reuters, but declined to comment further, noting that the contents of the accord are still confidential. In court documents, Brazilian prosecutors have portrayed Berkowitz, who went by the code name “Batman” in messages with alleged co-conspirators, as a central player in the kickback scheme and a recipient of Vitol bribes. He previously pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering in the United States, where the Federal Bureau of Investigation has opened a separate probe of the matter, Reuters reported last February. But Brazilian prosecutors have sought to interrogate Berkowitz for their own separate case, saying in November court documents they consider his testimony “of extreme importance” for cracking the case, given his first-hand role in soliciting, receiving and laundering bribes. Vitol, Trafigura and Glencore, which together control about 10% of the world’s oil consumption, have said they are cooperating with authorities. Trafigura, which has denied that its current management knew of improper payments, referred Reuters to a November statement that said it “is continuing to keep these matters under review and is taking the allegations previously made seriously.” Vitol said it “has a zero tolerance policy in respect of bribery and corruption.” Glencore declined to comment on Tuesday. Petrobras did not respond to a request for comment. The Berkowitz deal comes as the Brazil investigation heats up, with the pace of in-court interrogations quickly accelerating in recent months, according to documents reviewed by Reuters. Brazilian prosecutors met with Berkowitz over two days in Houston in early December as part of the discussions leading to the deal, and U.S. prosecutors were present for those meetings, said Kent Schaffer, Berkowitz’s U.S. attorney. That version of events was corroborated by a Rio de Janeiro-based lawyer also representing Berkowitz, Jorge Luis Camera. Schaffer added he is pushing for a broader agreement with Brazilian prosecutors that would also cover Berkowitz’s family members, including his father, Paulo Cesar, who was charged in 2018 with laundering the bribe payments."

Ives Gandra Martins Filho, a federal labor judge, said on Tuesday that the striking workers must not prevent the free movement of goods and people at Petrobras plants or those of its subsidiaries. According to Martins Filho, 90% of Petrobras employees are working and carrying out their duties as normal. Meanwhile, the Federação Única dos Petroleiros group of unions, or FUP, said in a statement that around 14,750 workers are now on strike, or 80% of the total in the 12 states where the industrial action is taking place. Unions say the strike, which began on Saturday, is in protest of layoffs at a loss-making fertilizer factory in the state of Paraná closed by Petrobras, and they also accuse the company of failing to comply with a collective labor agreement known as ACT. But Petrobras claims the strike is unjustified, as the collective bargaining agreement was signed by all unions in November last year and negotiations are ongoing. One of the FUP-affiliated unions, Sindipetro Norte Fluminense, said in a statement on Tuesday it instructed workers to walk off platforms and hand them over to management, which could potentially impact production. On Monday, Petrobras said it was calling in contingency teams to maintain operations, and even taking legal action in some cases to avoid any disruption to operations.

Petrobras was at the center of the so-called Car Wash investigation that since 2014 uncovered a sprawling corruption scheme involving public contracts that implicated hundreds of businesspeople, officials and politicians, including two Brazilian presidents. In July 2019, Reuters exclusively reported that the company was considering leaving the Distinction in Governance Program for State-Run Firms established by B3 SA, citing two people familiar with the matter. Petrobras, as the company is known, subsequently argued that it was unnecessary for the company to remain in the program and that its exit would not weaken governance of the company. In a securities filing on Wednesday, Petrobras said that it remains subject to rules as a public company listed on B3, where it is part of the Level 2 segment that has stricter governance rules, as well as being subject to Brazil’s law governing state-owned companies. “The company continues to stand out, in recent years, for the continuous improvement of its corporate governance rules and internal controls,” the statement said. In late 2018, the company closed down its special committee to aid investigations into corruption, citing progress made in rooting out graft. But sources with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters last year that the company continues to struggle to eliminate bad behavior. Fears of government meddling in the company also arose last year when Petrobras canceled a diesel price hike following President Jair Bolsonaro’s comments calling for fair diesel prices, amid concerns that truckers could seek to go on strike over fuel prices.

Petrobras denied it has already hired banks, but said it has already started studying how to structure the divestment. “There has still not been a decision by the company’s internal organs about how much of its stake should be sold, the ideal structure of the deal or even whether it will happen,” a Petrobras representative said in an emailed statement.

The base share offering could raise 19.5 billion reais ($4.66 billion), considering Petrobras’s closing share price on Tuesday. But the size may rise and BNDES may sell up to 23.5 billion reais ($5.6 billion) if demand allows the sale of overallotments. The last time Petrobras concluded a large share offering was in 2010, but at the time the company was raising money, not its shareholders. Reuters reported last month that BNDES had hired banks to sell its stake in common shares in Petrobras. The investment banking units of Credit Suisse, Bank of America, Banco Bradesco SA, Banco do Brasil SA, Citigroup Inc, Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Morgan Stanley and XP Inc will manage the offering. The shares are expected to begin trading on Feb. 7 in Brazil, Petrobras said. BNDES is divesting common shares of the oil company, but is keeping the preferential shares that it holds. Part of the sale proceedings will be transferred to the Brazilian Treasury.

The so-called transition deal comes after several meetings between the two companies in Brazil over the last month to negotiate the extension of a natural gas transport service contract signed in 1999 and due to expire on Dec 31, YPFB said in a statement. Petrobras, as the company is known, did not immediately comment on the matter. Under the terms of the transition agreement, which is valid from Jan. 1 to Mar. 10, Bolivia will continue to export up to 19.25 million cubic meters per day, as well as additional volumes to gradually meet the provision of 0.04 TCF (trillion cubic feet) that were paid by Petrobras, but not yet withdrawn. “In the aforementioned transition period, Petrobras will not make new anticipated payments for volumes of natural gas and no fines will be generated against YPFB for deliveries below 19.25 MMmcd,” YPFB added.

-68.09584070565055," British firms among potential bidders for Petrobras offshore oilfields: sources RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Anglo-French firm Perenco, UK-based Trident Energy and Premier Oil Plc are among the companies examining the purchase of a cluster of Petrobras oilfields in Brazil known as Polo Garoupa, seven told sources told Reuters in recent weeks. The deliberations are preliminary, and it is possible none of the firms will purchase the mature fields in Brazil’s offshore Campos Basin, at least under the terms Petrobras is offering, added the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss confidential matters. Brazil’s Petro Rio SA has also examined Garoupa, in keeping with the company’s strategy of looking at all mature oilfields being sold by Petrobras, the sources said. Perenco declined to comment while the other firms did not respond to requests for comment. Unlike previous oilfield divestments by Petrobras, the Garoupa sale has no non-binding phase. Potential bidders have signed confidentiality agreements and are discussing the asset internally and with Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the state-run firm is formally known. They have also discussed the potential formation of consortia, sources said. The next formal step will be the submission of binding offers. Slightly larger mature assets in the Campos Basin have generally fetched several hundred million dollars. But the sources said Garoupa is unusually complex and the potential price range is not yet clear. While binding offers were originally due in December, they have been postponed to March, they added. Polo Garoupa produced 19,600 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the 12 months through August, according to Petrobras, making it the largest production asset currently in the firm’s divestment portfolio. Petrobras is planning to divest at least $20 billion to $30 billion of assets over the next five years in a bid to reduce debt. It has already sold a number of legacy oilfields, and executives have said they are considering putting major production assets on the block in 2020. Yet Petrobras’ oilfield divestments have at times hit snags and bidders have occasionally criticized the pace of the process. Garoupa is considered more complex than recent assets of similar size that Petrobras has sold, the sources said. Decommissioning liabilities come to well over $2 billion, while some of the infrastructure at Garoupa, which has been producing since the 1970s, is considered dated. The cluster is also a transshipment point for natural gas being sent from larger fields further offshore, which could complicate operations and subject purchasers to penalties in the case of stoppages."
-72.85894390062036," Brazil probe into Petrobras widened to Maersk shipping contracts BRASILIA/RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian authorities on Wednesday targeted Maersk and other companies for allegedly paying bribes to get an edge in securing shipping contracts with state oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro SA, in the latest phase of a sprawling graft probe. Federal prosecutors said in a statement that Denmark’s A.P. Moller-Maersk, the world’s largest shipping company, was involved in allegedly paying $3.4 million in bribes related to 11 shipping contracts with Petrobras, worth 592 million reais ($141.07 million). Maersk confirmed in a statement that its offices in Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo were searched by Brazilian police, adding that it would co-operate fully with authorities. Petrobras said it continues to work with authorities, adding the company itself is a victim of corruption. Twelve search and seize warrants were carried out on Wednesday, prosecutors said, in order to further their investigation. Maersk met with Brazilian investigators here as far back as 2014 in relation to its dealings with Petrobras during the early stages of the corruption investigation. This is the 70th phase of the Car Wash probe that unveiled wide-ranging graft, upending the country’s political establishment by implicating hundreds of officials and executives. Prosecutors additionally named shipping brokers Tide Maritime and Ferchem as targets in the probe. A representative of Tide Maritime said the company is unaware of the issue and continues to operate normally, declining further comment. Ferchem could not immediately be reached for comment. The three companies are being investigated in relation to contracts with Petrobras totaling more than 5 billion reais ($1.19 billion), prosecutors said. Companies allegedly bribed Petrobras employees for privileged information on the schedule of ships used to transport oil and derivative products in order to gain an edge in bidding for contracts, federal police said in a statement. In the case of Maersk, the company used a brokerage that passed bribes to a Petrobras director, who has been actively assisting authorities in their investigation, prosecutors alleged. The fact that Maersk would use a brokerage with little experience aroused suspicions, helping prompt further investigation, they said. “We were able to verify that Maersk had chosen to hire a totally inexperienced broker, without any prior track record in the sector,” federal prosecutor Marcelo Ribeiro told a press briefing."

With a processing capacity of 150,000 barrels per day, REGAP is the fifth-largest refinery of eight up for sale by Petrobras, as part of a plan to raise around $10 billion to pay debts and sharpen its focus on offshore oil exploration and production. REGAP in the state of Minas Gerais is the only refinery for sale in southeastern Brazil, the nation’s economic powerhouse and the heart of its oil industry. The bid marks an entry into the race by Washington-based EIG, as the private equity firm looks to boost its downstream presence in Brazil’s energy industry. Reuters had reported last month that EIG was interested in REGAP. Sinopec had already delivered a non-binding offer for RLAM, a refinery in the northeastern state of Bahia, which is part of the first block of refineries put up for sale by Petrobras. Other firms selected for the second round of bidding on that block of refineries are Abu Dhabi’s state investor, plus fuel distributors Ultrapar Participações SA and Raizen. REGAP could offer operational efficiencies for EIG, which owns the Port of Açu in Rio de Janeiro state. Oil received at the port could be transported 500 kms (310 miles) inland to REGAP. EIG also owns a major stake in a Bolivia-Brazil gas pipeline and has bid on other assets divested by Petrobras. EIG declined to comment. Sinopec did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as Petrobras is formally known, said it would announce any noteworthy developments via public filings. The buyer of REGAP will also receive pipeline infrastructure connecting it to the region of the REDUC refinery, near Rio de Janeiro city, one of the sources said.

At a breakfast with journalists, Petrobras Exploration and Production Director Carlos Alberto de Oliveira said the firm would produce more than 2.7 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in 2019, with total production coming in on the upper end of the firm’s target range. In its formal guidance, Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the firm is formally known, predicted it would produce 2.7 million boepd this year, though actual production could vary 2.5% above or below the target. The firm produced a record 3.1 million boepd in November, the executive said, with production hitting 3.2 million barrels during one day in the month. At the same breakfast, Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco said studies carried out alongside China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) in recent months determined that it would not be economically viable to complete the Comperj refinery outside Rio de Janeiro. The formal announcement was not unexpected. Comperj has long been a symbol of endemic graft, and Castello Branco called it a “cemetery of corruption” on Monday. Petrobras is also rapidly exiting its downstream business and is currently selling off eight refineries throughout Brazil. The announcement appeared to put a nail in the coffin of the troubled refinery project, although Petrobras executives have signaled they plan to continue using the Comperj facility for less ambitious projects such as boosting industrial lubricants production. During the breakfast, executives also detailed how they plan to make $20 billion to $30 billion in divestments the firm has planned for the next five years. The company is negotiating with Japan’s Mitsui, which has a 49% stake in Petrobras’ gas distribution unit Gaspetro, to carry out an initial public offering for the unit in the second half of 2020, Castello Branco said. After the IPO, Petrobras would sell its entire stake in the unit, he said. While the firm had previously announced its intention to exit Gaspetro, executives had not specified details of the divestment plan. Petrobras has hired Goldman Sachs to determine how it will carry out its previously announced intention to sell some of its powerplants, Castello Branco said. He added that Petrobras received non-binding offers for its REGAP refinery in the interior state of Minas Gerais last week."

-32.17278896371425," Petrobras seeks swift sale of Braskem, smoother offshore auction process LONDON (Reuters) - The chief executive of Brazilian state-run oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) said on Friday he wants to sell the company’s stake in petrochemical company Braskem SA within a year. At the London leg of an international investor roadshow, top Petrobras officials presented plans to sell tens of billions of dollars in assets to reduce a hefty debt load. However, creditors of corruption-ensnared construction conglomerate Odebrecht SA, which also has a large stake in Braskem, are in advanced talks to delay the sale of the crown jewel asset for another two to three years, Reuters reported on Monday. “It’s a very long period of time to sell a company,” Petrobas CEO Roberto Castello Branco said during the meeting with investors in London. “We understood this as a signal of someone who at the end of the day doesn’t want to sell anything.” Branco also said that the process by which Brazil offers offshore oil blocks must be refined, with the current bidding system allowing Petrobas a privileged position. Last month, no major global oil firms committed to participate in an auction for the blocks in a major blow to the South American exporter’s ambitions to develop the sector. “It’s very important to have a significant change...toward the adoption of a more pro-market (regulatory) regime, eliminating all the complexities which at the end of the day reduce the attractiveness of Brazil,” Branco said. Asked if the firm would make a pledge similar to that from Spain’s Repsol to slash net carbon emissions to zero by the middle of the century, Branco told reporters: “It’s too early ... each company has its own views”. Petrobras’ refining and natural gas chief Anelise Lara said the company had completed a feasibility study with China’s CNPC over refining operations in Rio de Janeiro. She added that Petrobras was also looking to reduce the amount of gas it imports via a Bolivia-Brazil pipeline from a contracted 30 million cubic meters per day to 15 million following discussions with Brazil’s anti-trust regulator. Petrobras agreed a deal with the regulator earlier this year to foster competition in gas imports and encourage new participants in the market."

-22.86465119675733," Brazil's Petrobras says it may divest billions more than forecast NEW YORK/RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil’s Petrobras could add several billion dollars of assets to its already ambitious five-year divestment plan, executives said on Wednesday, underlining the state-run oil company’s rush to reduce its hefty debt load. In the company’s 2020 to 2024 business plan released last week, Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the company is formally known, said it would look to sell $20 billion to $30 billion of assets during that period, including eight refineries spread around Brazil. In a separate Wednesday presentation, released during Petrobras’ New York Investors’ Day, the company said it may add its Bolivian assets to the divestment program, as well as its stake in petrochemical firm Braskem SA, legacy deepwater oilfields and its remaining stake in fuel distribution firm, Petrobras Distribuidora SA, commonly known as BR Distribuidora. Talking to analysts and journalists, executives said they may sell parts of the Marlim oilfield, one of Brazil’s largest, as well as its majority stake in the smaller Papa-Terra field. Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco estimated a piece of Marlim could fetch around $2 billion to $4 billion, while Chief Financial Officer Andrea Almeida said the potential sale of its BR Distribuidora stake could bring in $2 billion to $3 billion. Petrobras has already failed previously, though, to sell its Braskem stake independently from controlling shareholder Odebrecht, but was not successful. Odebrecht and its creditor banks plan to keep the Braskem stake for at least more two years, Reuters reported earlier this week. “The extra assets that are not included in the plan are BR Distribuidora, Braskem and other (exploration and production) assets,” Almeida told journalists. “It adds to the $20 to $30 billion plan” The comments indicate Petrobras is still laser-focused on selling off assets in a bid to reduce debt and sharpen its focus on Brazil’s deepwater “pre-salt” area, a geological formation where billions of barrels of oil are trapped underneath a layer of salt beneath the ocean floor. In the presentation, Petrobras estimated it would boost its equity value by roughly 45% by 2021. Capital expenditure from 2020 to 2024 will be concentrated in the pre-salt, with a special emphasis on its Buzios field, the company said. Some 59% of $75 billion in forecast capital expenditure over the next five years will be geared toward the pre-salt formation. Around a quarter of total capital expenditure will go to Buzios, considered one of the world’s most promising oilfields. Petrobras also said it sees some $1 billion in “potential gains” in 2020 versus 2018 via increased sales of bunker fuel, which is generally used to power ships. International regulators are lowering the maximum allowed sulfur content in bunker fuel, which is seen as favorable for Brazil, as the nation’s crude is naturally low in sulfur. Brazil-listed preferred shares in Petrobras closed up 1.6% on Wednesday."

-17.85471439594231," Exclusive: Brazil, China, UAE firms in second round of bids for Petrobras refineries - sources SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil's state-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA PETR4.SA has selected four groups for the second round of bidding for four refineries up for sale, including China's Sinopec, Abu Dhabi's state investor and two Brazilian firms, according to four people with knowledge of the matter. Sinopec, Abu Dhabi's Mubadala Investment Co and Brazil's Ultrapar Participações SA UGPA3.SA and Raizen were chosen to go through to the next phase, they said. Brazil's Raizen is a joint venture between Cosan SA CSAN3.SA and Royal Dutch Shell Plc RDSa.L. Petrobras, as the oil company is known, received non- binding offers in early November for the first block of refineries it plans to sell. It selected the groups that will progress to the second round last week, the sources added, declining to be named as the details are confidential. The binding offers are expected to be delivered by mid-January, two of the sources said. The first block of refineries is the largest one, with a combined capacity of 961,000 oil barrels per day, or 40% of Brazil’s total refining capacity. Ultrapar, Raízen and Mubadala declined to comment. Petrobras and Sinopec did not immediately comment on the matter. According to the sources, Ultrapar and Raízen may deliver bids for the two refineries in the southern region, REFAP and REPAR, and for RNEST, in the northeastern state of Pernambuco. China’s Sinopec and Mubadala plan to bid for RLAM, Brazil’s oldest refinery, in the northeastern state of Bahia, the people said. RLAM needs significant renovations, and Sinopec is interested in forming a consortium with a Chinese construction company. Mubadala is expected to structure a deal involving Spanish oil company Cepsa, which has Mubadala and Carlyle Group as investors, two of the sources said. According to rules set forth by Brazil’s antitrust watchdog Cade, bidders can only acquire one refinery in each region. The sources said companies approved for the second round are in talks to create consortia with commodity traders such as Glencore and Vitol, that signed non disclosure agreements at the start of the process and are allowed to join the groups in the binding phase. Vitol and Glencore declined to comment. Operators of natural gas pipelines are also in talks to potentially join groups to operate the logistics assets that Petrobras will sell with each refinery, such as terminals and oil and fuel pipelines, they added. Among these groups are Canada’s Brookfield, which owns gas pipeline network company NTS, previously sold by Petrobras, the sources said. Brookfield declined to comment. Financial firms such as Canadian pension funds CPPIB and Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec (CDPQ), besides Singapore’s GIC, could also join, they said. The companies did not immediately comment. Oil behemoth Saudi Aramco, which had signed a non disclosure agreement, dropped out of the process, the sources said. Brazil’s history of imposing fuel price controls and a privatization model that will leave Petrobras with a strong presence in Brazil’s richest region, the southeast, have reduced the expected competition for the refineries. Initial estimates that the oil company could fetch up to $18 billion for the refineries have been reduced to around $10 billion. A second block of four refineries, which is expected to be put up for sale next year, is much smaller than the first, with a total capacity of roughly 200,000 barrels per day. REMAN, in the state of Amazonas, has attracted the interest of regional fuel distributor Atem Distribuição de Petroleo, one of the sources said. India’s conglomerate Essar, which has exploration operations in India and refining and fuel distribution assets in Britain, could also bid for one of the units in the second block, the sources added. EIG Global Energy Partners is also said to be eyeing REGAP, in Minas Gerais, according to one source. Atem, Essar and EIG did not immediately respond to requests for comment."
-17.85471439594231," Petrobras shares slip as production target disappoints SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Shares of Brazilian oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro SA slipped on Thursday after its oil and gas production outlook for next year disappointed analysts, despite ambitious long-term output forecasts in its new five-year strategic plan. Petrobras, as the state-run company is known, aims to produce 2.2 million barrels of oil per day (bpd) next year, below a prior outlook for more than 2.3 million bpd provided in the comparable strategic plan released last December. Preferred shares of Petrobras slid more than 1% in morning trade on the Sao Paulo stock exchange. The new 2020-2024 business plan provided “short term disappointment, long term upside,” Credit Suisse analyst Regis Cardoso told clients in a note, adding that he had expected a 2020 oil output target of up to 2.4 million bpd. Petrobras said its 2020 output estimate reflected natural production decline in mature fields and maintenance stoppages. The estimate was prone to a variation of 2.5%, up or down, the company said. Goldman Sachs analysts said the 2020 oil production target was 12% below their estimate, but underscored that the company’s long-term production outlook was higher than their expectations. Petrobras raised its oil production target for the end of the five-year period to 2.9 million bpd, reflecting aggressive development of major offshore prospects, as the company sells downstream assets to focus on exploration and production. Investors have grown impatient with repeated delays of that ramp up. In July, the company said it would not boost oil output by 10% this year as forecast, cutting its 2019 target to 2.1 million bpd from 2.3 million bpd. The delays, along with a near no-show among oil majors at a record oil auction this month, have dampened enthusiasm for Brazil as Latin America’s emerging petroleum powerhouse, which some say is held back by Petrobras’ balance sheet. The company’s latest divestment plan forecasts sales of $20-$30 billion over the next five years to reduce debts, concentrated in 2020 and 2021. The forecast was roughly in line with a target of $26.9 billion in the previous five-year plan. Petrobras plans to invest $75.7 billion between 2020 and 2024, with 85% of the total being allocated to exploration and production. Capital spending for the period fell from $84.1 billion in the 2019-2023 period, underscoring a sunset for the company’s most aggressive period of offshore investments. The company’s target for net debt to equal about 1.5 times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) remained unchanged."

-7.264375798485674," Exclusive: Failed Exxon talks left Petrobras stranded for auctions - sources RIO DE JANEIRO/LONDON (Reuters) - As the weeks ticked down to Brazil's biggest-ever oil auction, state-run Petrobras held increasingly frantic talks to find potential partners, with the heaviest blow coming when major Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N pulled out days before, according to six people familiar with the matter. While many firms were far from ready to take on enormous signing fees and investments, Exxon came closest but ultimately failed to reach acceptable terms for the blockbuster bidding round, according to four of the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss confidential negotiations. With that, the state firm formally known as Petroleo Brasileiro SA PETR4.SA was left to anchor an embarrassingly empty bidding round on Wednesday with token support from Chinese firms. The big Brazilian round was the latest offshore auction this year to undershoot expectations, hurt by competition from shale oil and other unconventional sources as well as lower demand forecasts. Most of the talks to form consortia between Petrobras and other oil firms were and brief and informal, according to the sources. But negotiations with Exxon were relatively advanced, offering the major a large stake in the coveted Buzios oil block until talks fell apart in the last few weeks, sources said. The ill-fated talks show how even global firms that were seriously interested in the landmark “transfer-of-rights” (TOR) auction on Wednesday could not accept the terms of a required partnership with Petrobras – long seen as a bottleneck to the development of Brazil’s most promising deepwater resources. The proposed Exxon-Petrobras consortium, which would have included the two Chinese state firms that ultimately bought 10% of Buzios block' rights, CNODC and CNOOC 0883.HK, would have given a seal of private-sector approval to the landmark auction. Instead the lack of major partners revealed how the powerful role of Petrobras in the so-called “pre-salt polygon,” along with complicated development terms and expensive signing fees discourage interest, even among majors with large purchasing power, in one of the world’s biggest proven oil reserves. Exxon and Petrobras did not respond to requests for comment. CNOOC and CNPC did not immediately respond to e-mails sent outside business hours.  Much remains unclear as to why the talks did not bear fruit. One source said the Petrobras and Exxon disagreed over the way billions of dollars would be paid to the Brazilian firm in compensation for prior investments. Others cited differences over how much to invest in platforms to ramp up production. Exxon was interested in taking over operations at the field, a non-starter for Petrobras, according to one of the sources. All sources agreed that the complicated nature of the TOR auction played a major role in keeping the talks from reaching the finish line. This has been confirmed by Brazilian authorities to explain why the country failed to catch money from foreign oil companies. “It’s an awful system,” Economy Minister Paulo Guedes said on Thursday. “You have to go through many layers of negotiations just to get to the oil.” Due to an agreement signed between Petrobras and the Brazilian government in 2010, the state firm already has rights to develop up to 5 billion barrels of oil in the TOR area. The Wednesday auction concerned oil in the TOR area in excess of what Petrobras had already been promised. As a result, any winning member of a consortium would have needed to bang out a complex deal reconciling itself with the existing claims of Petrobras in the region. Brazil’s government would then have needed to approve the deal. In the end, the state-run company was nearly alone in submitting minimum bids for two of the four areas in the TOR bidding round, which officials hoped would cement Brazil’s ascendance as Latin America’s undisputed oil powerhouse. Petrobras won Itapu, the smallest block up for grabs, with a solo offer. Sepia and Atapu, the second and third largest blocks respectively, received no bids. Had the government sold off all areas, it would have reaped some 106.5 billion reais ($25.8 billion) in signing bonuses. Instead Brazil got just under 70 billion reais. The following day, Petrobras was also almost completely alone when bidding for the largest of five oil blocks offered at the country’s sixth pre-salt bidding round, the Aram area. China’s CNODC again accompanied the state-run company by committing to a 20% stake. The results of both rounds were widely seen as a disappointment, as no private firms placed bids for fields that are known to hold billions of barrels of untapped crude. Economy Minister Guedes told Reuters on Friday that the week’s auctions were a “condemnation” of the production-sharing system Brazil uses in the pre-salt polygon, adding that the country needs to shift toward a concession model. Following the results, Brazilian Mines and Energy Minister Bento Albuquerque said the government had learned a lesson, and would adjust the rules of any future auction. That could involve lowering the minimum signing bonuses required from bidders, among other parameters, he said. “We’re evaluating the whole process, and we’re certain that we’re going to correct it,” Albuquerque told Reuters."

-10.160591000526345," Big oil stuns Brazil in back-to-back auction flops RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Major global oil firms snubbed a second Brazilian oil auction in a row on Thursday, passing up offshore blocks and forcing officials to reconsider a bidding system that gives a privileged position to state-run Petroleo Brasileiro SA PETR4.SA. The only block awarded in Thursday’s bidding went to Petrobras, as the Brazilian state-run firm is known, and Chinese state firm CNODC, a unit of China National Petroleum Corp, which offered the minimum bid. Four other blocks received no bids. The result, following a lack of foreign interest in an even bigger Wednesday round, was a wake-up call to those who expected this week to crown Brazil as uncontested champion of the Latin American oil industry. Analysts have agreed in recent days that promising oil prospects in Brazil’s pre-salt area, where billions of barrels of oil are trapped under a layer of salt beneath the sea floor, are getting pricey even for oil majors with strong interest. The deepwater blocks also require enormous long-term investments compared with alternatives such as shale fields. “All majors are focused on capital discipline and value versus volume. They will not bid at any cost for pre-salt assets,” said Marcelo de Assis, head of Latin America upstream for consultancy Wood Mackenzie. Brazil’s new right-wing government pledged market-friendly reforms and has worked to scale back the role of Petrobras in the energy industry so that better-capitalized firms can tap its vast reserves. After the meager auctions, officials suggested they needed to do even more, in particular scrapping the right of first refusal that Petrobras has to operate any fields in the so-called “pre-salt polygon.” Economy Minister Paulo Guedes called the production-sharing arrangement in the area “awful,” suggesting a simple concession model would be better and mocking Wednesday’s round that saw Petrobras win rights to fields where it already operates. “We undertook an enormous challenge to, in the end, sell to ourselves. We spent five years talking about it. We made a spectacular effort, studying, debating — and in the end it was a no-show,” Guedes told an audience in Brasilia on Thursday. The comments from Guedes and other officials added to signs that Brazil was ready to turn the page on the oil laws that have put Petrobras at the center of offshore development for years, hurting competition and racking up debt for the firm. Petrobras closed 4% higher on Thursday amid the calls for a more straightforward concession model in upcoming oil rounds. Decio Oddone, the head of Brazilian oil regulator ANP, said the special rights of Petrobras discouraged some rivals, adding that he was surprised at the results, as he expected at least three blocks to be awarded in Thursday’s bidding round. Petrobras itself failed to submit bids for two blocks where it had initially exercised its preferential rights. Its only bid on Thursday was a minimum offer for the Aram block, with a signing bonus of 5 billion reais ($1.2 billion), along with China National Oil and Gas Exploration and Development Corp (CNODC), which took a 20% stake. Brazilian Mines and Energy Minister Bento Albuquerque said “it does not seem to make sense” for Brazil to maintain the special Petrobras rights exclusively in the area. He said the government must learn a lesson from the auctions to get better results in the future. “We understand from what the companies tell us that our areas continue to be very attractive and productive,” the minister said. Other officials backed up the sentiment, pointing to strong foreign demand in prior pre-salt rounds since 2017. Brazil also failed on Wednesday to award two of four blocks in the nation’s most ambitious oil round ever, as steep signing fees and the dominance of Petrobras in the “transfer-of-rights” (TOR) area scared off oil majors. “Brazil is competing with opportunities everywhere in the world,” said Assis, of Wood Mackenzie. “Brazil’s pre-salt assets are attractive, but up to a price.”"
-10.160591000526345," Itaúsa-led group wins bidding for Petrobras' Liquigas unit SAO PAULO, Nov 7 (Reuters) - A group led by Brazilian investment firm Itaúsa has won the bidding to buy state-run Petrobras’ LPG distribution unit Liquigas with an offer of 3.7 billion reais ($906.97 million), Petrobras said on Thursday. Reuters reported in August that the consortium, which also includes local LPG distribution firms Copagaz and Nacional Gás Butano, had placed the highest bid for the unit. “The transaction will still be subject to approval by the relevant Petrobras bodies and subsequent project steps will be disclosed to the market in a timely manner,” the company added, without mentioning deadlines. The Liquigas sale is part of a broader asset-selling drive by Petrolero Brasileiro, as the company is officially known. Itaúsa, the investment holding company that controls bank Itaú Unibanco Holding SA and other companies, said its participation in the operation will be acquired via a stake in Copagaz, which will leave Itaúsa with approximately 49% of the local distributor’s capital. Petrobras added that it expects to sign the sale agreement later this year, but stressed that the acquisition will not have an effect on its balance sheet in the current fiscal year.

-7.704783959973742," Biggest Brazil oil auction disappoints as only Petrobras and Chinese firms bid RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil’s biggest-ever oil auction frustrated expectations on Wednesday, as high prices and the dominant role of state-run oil company Petrobras scared off global oil majors. Petroleo Brasileiro SA PETR4.SA, as the Brazilian firm is also known, and Chinese state firms CNOOC 0883.HK and CNODC [CNPC.UL] made the only bids out of over a dozen major oil firms who had registered. Two of four blocks on offer got no bids. The setback was a harsh reminder that, even as promising offshore fields make Brazil a rare bright spot in Latin America’s petroleum industry, steep signing bonuses and tricky production-sharing deals can keep foreign players at bay. Officials said the results were satisfactory, yet some acknowledged that giving Petrobras preferential rights in Brazil’s most promising offshore areas was bad for competition, suggesting the government wants to scrap that legal requirement. Petrobras shares erased early gains made on hopes of attracting more foreign partners. Brazil's currency, the real BRBY, slipped 2%. “We thought there would be competition. There wasn’t, but it’s not my place to comment,” Petrobras Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco said following the auction. Brazil’s government still got about 70 billion reais ($17 billion) of signing fees from the minimum bid by Petrobras in a consortium with the Chinese for the round’s biggest block, Buzios, and a lone Petrobras bid for the smallest block, Itapu. If all four blocks had received a bid, the government would have won 106.5 billion reais in signing bonuses, offering more relief for a tight federal budget and highlighting Brazil’s ascendance as Latin America’s oil powerhouse. The auction fell short of expectations, according to Raphael Figueiredo, an analyst at Sao Paulo-based Eleven Financial, as a greater foreign presence in the bidding was desired. “Total disaster is the best way to describe this morning’s round,” said Ivan Cima, a managing director at consultancy Welligence, referring to lack of private participation and the loss of $9 billion in potential signing bonuses to be received by the government. “The round was doomed by high signature bonuses, the overly complex and non-transparent Petrobras reimbursements, and marginal economics,” he said. ‘A LOT OF CAUTION’ Andre Araujo, the top executive for Royal Dutch Shell Plc RDSa.L in Brazil, characterized the blocks as expensive. “We’ve said for a long time that (Shell) will continue exercising very strong discipline when it comes to investments,” he told journalists after the auction. “We make any new investment decision with a lot of caution.” In the run-up to the auction, several other companies, including majors Total SA TOTF.PA and BP Plc BP.L, said they would not bid or found the terms expensive. Brazilian Mines and Energy Minister Bento Albuquerque said the government was “satisfied” with the results of the auction. He said the Sepia and Atapu blocks, which attracted no interest, would be put up for auction next year. Marcio Felix, Brazil’s former oil and gas secretary and a key architect of the auction, said the government may need to reduce the signing bonuses in those fields. In a note, analysts at Wood Mackenzie said they expected greater competition from oil majors in Brazil’s sixth pre-salt bidding round, a much more conventional oil auction scheduled for Thursday. The sale of Buzios and Itapu alone makes the auction a success, government officials previously said. Petrobras had already committed to bidding on those two blocks and operating them, paying the signing fees with the funds from a settlement with the government related to the so-called “transfer-of-rights” (TOR) area. On the monster Buzios block, Petrobras took a 90% stake while 5% went to each of two Chinese partners: China National Offshore Oil Corp (CNOOC) 0883.HK and China National Oil and Gas Exploration and Development Corp (CNODC), a unit of China National Petroleum Corp. Petrobras already has four operating platforms in Buzios, and plans to install four more in Buzios and the other nearby blocks by 2023."

Africa Oil AOI.TO said it would conclude the $1.5 billion purchase alone after Vitol and Delonex Energy pulled out of the deal to buy half of Petrobras Oil and Gas, known as Petrobras Africa, from the Brazilian company. [reut.rs/337lQXN] “We remain committed to completing this acquisition and look forward to working with Petrobras and all stakeholders to accomplish that goal,” Keith Hill, chief executive of Vancouver-based Africa Oil, said in a statement. Africa Oil said the deal will go ahead under the previously agreed terms. It has agreed a $250 million loan facility with BTG Pactual and will fund the rest with available cash. BTG, Brazil’s largest independent investment bank, owns the other 50% stake in Petrobras Africa, whose core assets are stakes in offshore fields that produce Nigerian oil grades Agbami, Egina and Akpo.. Vitol did not issue a statement on the withdrawal. A source close to Vitol said the deal was taking too long to close, including the wait for necessary clearances from Brazilian and Nigerian officials. Two sources close to the deal also said Vitol soured on it in part because it would not have got physical oil cargoes from it. “At the end of the day, it was a non-core business for Vitol, so they walked away,” one source said. The sale is part of a Petrobras effort to offload $21 billion in assets amid heavy debts and a corruption scandal. The Petrobras Africa assets include an 8% interest in OML 127, which includes Agbami, and 16% interest in OML 130, which contains Akpo and Egina. A Chevron CVX.N affiliate operates OML 127, while Total TOTF.PA affiliates operate OML 130. Akpo produces 130,000 barrels per day (bpd) of condensate, while Egina, which started last year, will produce roughly 200,000 bpd. Agbami, with 240,000 bpd of light, sweet crude, is the most prized part of the asset. David Round, E&P analyst with BMO Capital Markets, said despite Vitol’s exit, it remains an attractive deal. “Africa Oil’s decision to become sole acquirer (and ability to fund) illustrates the impressive level of cash generation from the assets, although we expect the market to remain cautious as completion is still pending after 12 months,” Round said."

-6.233701983002089," Petrobras floats exiting Braskem via share sale RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil's state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA PETR4.SA is studying exiting its stake in Braskem SA BRKM5.SA via a share offering, an executive said on Friday, the latest in a series of proposals to separate itself from the petrochemical firm. Anelise Lara, head of Petrobras’ downstream division, divulged the potential share offering, which she said was being considered alongside more traditional M&A options, at a press conference after the company’s third quarter results. Petrobras, as the company is widely known, has long been trying to reduce its stake in Braskem as part of a wider push to sharpen its focus on offshore oil production. But its plans have hit a number of snags, as Braskem battles regulatory and legal issues. Under the possible plan, Lara said Braskem shares would be consolidated into one class. Those shares would then migrate to the Novo Mercado segment of the Sao Paulo stock exchange, which demands higher governance standards, but generally fetches a premium for its constituents. Petrobras, which holds a nearly 40% stake in the firm, would then unwind its stake in the company via a share offering, similar to Petrobras' privatization of fuel distribution unit Petrobras Distribuidora SA BRDT3.SA in July, Lara said. Preferred shares in Braskem jumped over 3%, but quickly erased most gains. Shares were down 0.14% in afternoon trade. Braskem did not immediately respond to a request for comment. On Thursday evening, Petrobras hit third-quarter margin estimates, and said production costs in a key oil-producing zone known as the “pre-salt” had fallen 20% compared to the previous quarter to $5.03 per barrel. Later, in a call with analysts, Exploration and Production Director Carlos Alberto de Oliveira said costs at the coveted Buzios field could fall to less than $4 per barrel. He added, however, that costs could be slightly higher next quarter thanks to the ramp-up of the P-70 platform and other one-off factors, likely bringing costs back near $6 per barrel. Still, analysts were encouraged by the cost savings and overall financial results. Analysts at Banco BTG Pactual SA BPAC3.SA called the production cost figures ""impressive,"" adding that the firm's earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization beat their estimates by 13%. Brazil-listed preferred shares in Petrobras were up 3.7% in afternoon trade, after jumping 4% earlier in the day, their biggest intraday gain in over a month."

In a securities filing announcing its third-quarter results, Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the company is formally known, said the cost of lifting a barrel of oil from the offshore pre-salt formation had fallen to $5.03, down 20% from the second quarter. Petrobras is currently selling off billions of dollars of midstream and downstream assets, as well as shallow-water and onshore oilfields. It has said it will concentrate its focus and capital on the pre-salt, a vast formation where billions of barrels of oil are trapped under a thick layer of salt beneath the ocean floor. The pre-salt is also home to what is known as the transfer-of-rights, or TOR, region, where the Brazilian government is set to auction off production rights on Nov. 6 in a process expected to bring around $26 billion into state coffers. Petrobras reported third-quarter net income came to 9.09 billion reais ($2.25 billion), significantly lower than the previous quarter partly because of already announced one-off charges, some of which pertained to arbitral and legal disputes. Petrobras also benefited from billions of dollars in divestments in the second quarter, making for a difficult comparative base. However, third-quarter margins largely came in line with the consensus. Adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization stood at 32.6 billion reais, a touch above UBS analysts’ estimate of 32.3 billion reais. In management comments, Petrobras said it benefited in the quarter from the privatization of its former fuel distribution unit Petrobras Distribuidora SA BRDT3.SA, as well as an already announced boost in oil and gas production. The company also reiterated its focus on divestments. It said it will receive non-binding offers for four refineries - RNEST, RELAM, REPAR and REFAP - in November, in a process expected to rake in billions of dollars."

-2.6084047311096525," Exclusive: Petrobras, Brazil's government near oil marketing deal - official RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil’s Petrobras could take over marketing of the government’s share of crude from offshore oilfields, a government official told Reuters, adding significantly to the state-run oil firm’s trading operations. In an interview on Monday, the head of Pre-Salt Petroleum, better known by its Portuguese acronym PPSA, said it is close to inking a deal in which Petrobras’ trading desk will manage the oil that Brazil’s government receives from private sector firms. The potential deal, being discussed ahead of a blockbuster season for oil bidding rounds in the South American nation, would significantly boost the volume of crude traded by Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the firm is formally known. Petrobras declined to comment on the negotiations. On Nov. 6, a who’s who of international oil firms will compete to snap up prolific offshore oilfields in Brazil in a process expected to fetch some $25 billion for the government. The following day, firms will compete in a separate process expected to bring another $2 billion into state coffers. Following significant exploration work in the area, the fields are known to hold billions of barrels of untapped crude. All winners will hand a significant chunk of that oil over to the government, via the PPSA, as is standard practice within Brazil’s so-called “pre-salt” oil producing region. Due mainly to the upcoming rounds, the oil that the PPSA manages could soar from just a few thousands barrels per day (bpd) last year to around 500,000 bpd by 2028 according to preliminary estimates, PPSA head José Eduardo Gerk said in an interview. That compares with Petrobras’ current exports of 583,000 bpd in the September quarter. Last year, the PPSA sold its oil on the spot market and via auctions. But that is set to change as the agency closes in on the outsourcing contract with Petrobras, Gerk said. “Since I got here (in April), the negotiations ... with Petrobras have gone forward and we hope to be able to come to an agreement by the end of the year,” he told Reuters. With the oil it receives set to skyrocket in the coming years, the PPSA is also set to grow. Currently a relatively sleepy agency of 44 employees located in downtown Rio de Janeiro, Gerk said the agency hopes to hire another 50 in-house employees by 2021."

Swiss prosecutors said they had submitted the case to the Federal Criminal Court under an accelerated proceeding to conclude a case more quickly, in which an admission of guilt and acceptance of civil claims by the accused was required. The unnamed suspect is a person of Swiss-Brazilian origin who already faces criminal proceedings in Brazil and Portugal. The court may still reject the accelerated request, prosecutors said, which would revert the case to a normal procedure. The Petrobras-Odebrecht case has led to around 60 criminal proceedings Switzerland while more than 130 businessmen and politicians have been convicted in the case in Brazil. The Swiss attorney general has seized assets in Switzerland worth more than 620 million Swiss francs ($627 million) and returned around 390 million francs to the Brazilian authorities.

5.713008032423107," UPDATE 2-Brazil's Petrobras posts another major production boost (Adds detail on production figures, P-68 platform) RIO DE JANEIRO, Oct 17 (Reuters) - Brazilian state-run oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro SA posted a significant production boost in the third quarter, as heavy investments in its deepwater, pre-salt zone showed signs of paying off. Investors and analysts have been watching the firm’s production figures closely in recent quarters, and the company’s ability to swiftly boost output is key to its current strategy. In a Thursday securities filing, Petrobras, as the firm is commonly known, said it produced 2.878 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in the third quarter, up 9.3% from the previous quarter and 14.6% from the same period a year ago. August monthly production reached a new record of 3 million boepd, and daily production hit a high of 3.1 million boepd during the month. The company is on target to reach its annual production target of 2.7 million boepd, Petrobras added in the filing. First quarter production at Petrobras was considered weak, and while second-quarter figures were markedly better, some analysts were spoked by poor June figures, which were affected by a number of stoppages. In late July, Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco revised the firm’s 2019 annual target to 2.7 million boepd from a previous 2.8 million, which hit Petrobras shares. Third quarter production in Petrobras’ core pre-salt region climbed 17% from the previous quarter. Post-salt production, which also takes place in deep waters, as well as onshore production remained roughly steady on a quarterly basis. Shallow-water production increased 9.8% from the second quarter, Petrobras said, as platform stoppages were reversed. The company said its new P-68 production platform left the shipyard in September and is currently in the anchoring process. It will begin producing in Petrobras’ Berbigao and Sururu oilfields in the fourth quarter."

Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the firm is formally known, did not respond to a request for comment on whether the fire could extend the stoppage, which began on Thursday, according to the local union. On Sunday, a fire broke out at Petrobras’ Revap refinery, located in the state of Sao Paulo. The facility has a processing capacity of 252,000 barrels per day, or about 14% of Brazil’s total refining capacity. Nobody was hurt in the incident, and the fire is contained, the company said on Monday. The company did not respond to additional questions on potential, long-term output losses. Petrobras is currently selling eight refineries in a process that is expected to raise several billion dollars for the company, though Revap is not among the refineries being sold.

In a statement on Thursday, Brazil’s environmental agency Ibama said it has been investigating the spill in several beaches in some northeastern states since Sept. 2. Petrobras, as the state-controlled oil company is known, said in a securities filing on Wednesday that the spilled oil was not produced in the country, without elaborating. It added that nonetheless, it was contributing to the cleaning efforts of the beaches, with some 100 Petrobras employees helping clean up the spill. Beaches in the states of Rio Grande do Norte, Maranhao, Ceara, Paraiba, Pernambuco, Alagoas and Sergipe were affected. Brazil’s northeast hosts some of the nicest beaches in the country, a top tourism destination for Brazilians. Some marine turtles were contaminated by the oil.

11.396197552069172," Brazilian energy firm Petrobras doubles down on oil and gas in strategic plan RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil’s Petrobras has approved a new vision statement making explicit the firm’s focus on oil and gas, the company said on Thursday, formalizing recent statements by executives that have played down the company’s interest in renewables. In a securities filing, Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the state-run firm is formally known, released part of an updated 2020-2024 strategic plan. While light on specifics, the document made clear the firm was laser focused on extracting oil and gas from deepwater fields off Brazil’s coast, while returning as much value as possible to shareholders. Petrobras’ goal “is to be the best energy company in terms of generating value for shareholders, with a focus on oil and gas and security with respect to people and the environment,” the company said. Previously the company, Latin America’s largest by many measures, described itself as an “integrated energy company, that is evolving with society, generates significant value and has unique technical capacity.” Petrobras still plans to carry out research into the long-term viability of wind and solar power in Brazil, the firm said. However, the plan reflects repeated statements by Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco, who was appointed to the position in January, asserting that the firm has no competitive advantage when it comes to renewables. He has given short shrift to efforts by other major oil companies to diversify into wind and solar power, calling them marketing ploys. The last significant wind or solar incentive announced by Petrobras was in September 2018, when the company inked a three-year deal with Norway’s Equinor ASA to jointly seek out offshore wind projects."

7.681413723313464," Brazil's Petrobras confronts new foe: fuel thieves RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian state-run oil firm Petrobras has in the last five years battled an epic corruption probe, a crippling recession and unsteady crude prices. Now, Brazil’s most important company is facing yet another challenge: thieves are robbing millions of dollars worth of its fuel to sell on a thriving black market. Theft from Petrobras pipelines soared to a record high 261 incidents in the states of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo last year, up from just one case in 2014, according to an August securities filing and statements made to Reuters by representatives of Petroleo Brasileiro SA PETR4.SA, as the company is formally known. Most of those heists, police say, are the work of sophisticated criminal groups, some with their own trucks, distribution firms and even retail gas stations. “They’re creative creatures,” said Julio da Silva Filho, the head of a Rio police unit that investigates oil theft. Crime costs Petrobras’ distribution subsidiary, Petrobras Transporte SA, or Transpetro, over 150 million reais ($37 million) per year, Petrobras Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco said at an event in June. The alleged losses are tiny compared to those of another Latin American energy powerhouse - Mexico - where crime gangs have infiltrated the petroleum business in a big way. Fuel theft costs state-run Pemex over $3 billion annually, according to company figures. But stamping out Brazil’s problems early, da Silva said, will be crucial to keeping gangsters from becoming entrenched in its oil industry. “We’re working exactly to prevent Brazil from turning into Mexico,” he said. Transpetro has set up a program to gather intelligence on criminal groups and is spending 100 million reais ($24 million) a year to fund it, according a high-ranking company source, who requested anonymity to avoid retaliation from organized crime groups. Around 50 staffers are now studying the issue, including tracking the patterns and methods of oil thieves and sharing those findings with law enforcement, the person said. The company, which did not respond to a request for comment, has also set up a hotline for the public to report fuel robbery. Some foreign investors, too, are beefing up security. They include TAG, a pipeline unit that France's Engie SA ENGIE.PA bought from Petrobras for $8.6 billion in April. The firm told Reuters in a statement that it is working with Transpetro, whose pipelines often run beside TAG’s pipes, to increase foot patrols and reinforce physical barriers, among other measures. “This phenomenon is becoming very organized,” said Emmanuel Delfosse, TAG’s chief operational officer. “It’s hard to go after these people.” Fuel is an expensive commodity in Brazil, where the pump price of gasoline works out to more than $4 a gallon. Crime gangs traditionally focused on narcotics trafficking have branched out into fuel theft in recent years, according to authorities. So have so-called militias, police say, which sprang up to battle drug gangs but have morphed into fearsome crime outfits in their own right. These groups are highly organized, with separate divisions dedicated to tapping illegally into pipelines, transporting the stolen fuel and keeping a lookout for cops, said Simone Sibilio, the head prosecutor for Rio state’s organized crime unit. She said gangsters fence the product through firms such as asphalt companies whose operations require large amounts of petroleum products. They also sell to unscrupulous gas station owners, undercutting legal competitors on price, authorities said. Crooks have also muscled into retail sales. Police say criminals entered the gas station business years ago as a means of laundering cash from other illicit operations. Now, stocking those pumps with stolen fuel has become a lucrative new profit center, authorities said. First Capital Command, one of Brazil’s most notorious crime gangs, controls around 300 gas stations in Sao Paulo state, according to Paulo Miranda, head of the gas station industry group Fecombustiveis. That comes to around 3% of the state’s approximately 9,000 gas stations. “It’s a fuel mafia,” Miranda said. Petrobras CEO Castello Branco has called for harsher sentences for pipeline attackers to reduce fuel theft. The firm is also close to signing formal agreements with Mexico's Pemex and Colombia's Ecopetrol ECO.CN to facilitate the sharing of anti-theft strategies, the Transpetro source said. None of those companies responded to requests for comment. In the meantime, heightened vigilance appears to be paying off. Through the end of July, fuel heists in Brazil were down 33% compared to the same period in 2018, Petrobras securities filings show, though they remain high by historical standards. Lucas Tristão, secretary of development for Rio state, said authorities have shut down 10 gas stations in Rio for various crimes in 2019. In July, police blew the lid off an extortion racket at a Petrobras refinery northeast of Rio, where Tristão alleges a local militia was demanding kickbacks from contractors at the complex. Gabriel Poiava, one of the detectives on that case, said it’s an example of gangsters looking up and down Brazil’s oil supply chain to see where they could grab a piece of the riches. “If they believed some activity could be extorted there, they would try,” he said."

4.25956169120821," Brazil's Petrobras holds fuel prices steady despite oil spike after Saudi attack RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro and Petrobras said on Monday the oil firm was not planning to immediately raise fuel prices in response to the attack in Saudi Arabia, showing the state-run firm may be open to overlooking market pricing norms for now. In an interview with Brazil’s Record TV, Bolsonaro said he was told by Petrobras Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco that while fuel prices set by the firm tend to follow international prices, the recent rise in oil prices was “atypical”. “I talked a little bit ago with Petrobras’ CEO, Castello Branco,” Bolsonaro said. “He told me that, as it’s something atypical and that it appears it will end, he’s not planning on adjusting fuel prices.” Shortly after Bolsonaro’s comments, Petrobras released a statement saying it had decided not to adjust fuel prices for now, but would observe market conditions in the coming days and make a decision on prices at the appropriate time. The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the conversation between Bolsonaro and Castello Branco. In response to a massive truckers’ strike in May 2018, Brazil’s government forced Petrobras to cut fuel prices, leading the firm’s then chief executive, Pedro Parente, to resign in protest. That in turn sparked a major sell-off in the company’s shares. Investors ever since have been wary of possible political interference at Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the firm is formally known. Bolsonaro’s government, which took power in January, has pledged a hands-off approach. But Bolsonaro is a relative newcomer to free market economics, and for decades had advocated interventionist policies as a federal congressman. In April, Petrobras shares fell around 8% after the company canceled a diesel price hike following a conversation between Bolsonaro and Castello Branco. ‘GOOD TEST’ In a note to clients earlier on Monday, analysts at UBS led by Luiz Carvalho said the Saturday attack in Saudi Arabia, which interrupted about 5% of the world’s oil supply and sent prices soaring, would be a good test for Petrobras. “Over the past years, we have seen several examples where the company was not able to follow international prices leading to significant losses in the refining business,” the analysts wrote. They added that a failure to lower prices could harm the ongoing sale of eight refineries by Petrobras, which is expected to fetch billions of dollars. Earlier on Monday, Reuters reported that Petrobras was planning on keeping fuel prices steady for the time being, rather than react to short-term volatility. Brazil-listed preferred shares in the firm closed up 4.4% on Monday, buoyed by spiking crude prices."

9.136815655446927," Exclusive: Petrobras unit head removed amid bribery allegations RIO DE JANEIRO/BRASILIA (Reuters) - The chief executive of a natural gas pipeline unit of Brazilian state oil firm Petrobras PETR4.SA has been removed, the company told Reuters on Thursday, after a middleman in a graft scheme implicated him in plea bargain testimony. Transportadora Brasileira Gasoduto Bolívia-Brasil (TBG), which operates a 1,610-mile pipeline transporting natural gas from Bolivia to Brazil, said its board approved the removal of Ivan de Sá on Wednesday at the request of Petrobras, its majority shareholder. TBG did not state the reason for his removal, nor offer any further details. Reuters had asked TBG and parent firm Petrobras on Tuesday about the previously unreported plea bargain testimony. In the testimony, reviewed by Reuters, a middleman said that Sá helped coordinate a scheme in which Petrobras employees purportedly accepted bribes from commodity trading firm Vitol in return for cut-price oil contracts. On Wednesday, Sá denied the allegations in a statement sent through TBG’s press office. “Mr. Ivan de Sá received with confusion and indignation the information that his name had been mentioned in plea bargain testimony, TBG said. The allegations “do not rise above mere insinuation, speculative in character, without any basis in fact or proof.” Sá is one of the highest-profile executives at Petrobras hit by graft allegations since President Jair Bolsonaro took office in January, pledging a break with years of corruption. Scores of politicians, business leaders and even Petrobras CEOs have been charged with bribery schemes over the past five years. Sá took the helm at TBG in May, according to his LinkedIn profile. Until April, he was chief executive of fuel distributor Petrobras Distribuidora SA BRDT3.SA, which was privatized in July. He was previously a manager in Petrobras' trading unit. Petrobras said it had immediately begun internal inquiries after learning about the plea bargain testimony and had removed employees named in the testimony from their positions. It added that it was not pre-judging employees and that the allegations did not yet appear to be backed by material evidence. Petrobras Distribuidora said in a statement that the events described in the testimony “had no relation to the firm.” According to the documents seen by Reuters, which summarize a plea deal reached in August with federal prosecutors, oil industry veteran Carlos Henrique Nogueira Herz testified he had helped funnel bribes to Petrobras employees in return for sweetheart fuel trades with trading firms Vitol and Trafigura from 2011 to 2014. Herz also testified that Sá had helped to manage a scheme in which employees in Petrobras' trading unit manipulated an algorithm determining when and where to buy oil. He said the manipulation made Petroleo Brasileiro SA PETR4.SA, as Petrobras is formally known, buy Vitol oil at inflated prices. Herz said he did not have direct knowledge of the specific scheme. The testimony does not make clear when it supposedly took place. Herz said Carlos Roberto Martins Barbosa, at one point a high-ranking Petrobras trading manager, told him of Sá’s role during a jail yard conversation. The two were detained together in December 2018 and January 2019, according to the court documents, after both men were charged over allegations they belonged to a criminal group funneling bribes to Petrobras employees. Herz provided dozens of pages of e-mails and bank statements detailing the bribery scheme as a whole, though none of the e-mails and bank statements reviewed by Reuters referenced Sá. In a statement, Vitol said it would not be appropriate to comment on Herz’s testimony “beyond reiterating our zero tolerance policy in respect of bribery and corruption” and cooperating fully with authorities. Trafigura said in a statement that it was aware of reports of Herz’s testimony but had not been contacted by Brazilian authorities in relation to the allegations. “Any suggestion that Trafigura’s current management knew that its payments would be used to make improper payments to employees of Petrobras is not correct,” the statement said. “Trafigura has a zero tolerance policy on bribery and corruption.” A law office representing the former trading manager Barbosa did not answer phone calls or a message sent to an e-mail address listed on registration documents. A lawyer for Herz did not respond to requests for comment on Facebook and LinkedIn. The lawyer’s offices did not pick up phone calls. Prosecutors did not respond to a request for comment. The oil trading investigation became public knowledge in December when prosecutors said that Vitol, Trafigura, Glencore GLEN.L and Mercuria Energy Group used intermediaries to pay at least $31 million in bribes to Petrobras employees. In return, the Petrobras employees sold them oil at below-market rates and offered privileged information that gave them an edge over competitors when trading with the oil firm, prosecutors said. The companies, which together control about 10 percent of the world’s daily oil consumption, have said they are cooperating with the Brazilian investigation."

The individuals named in the previously unreported documents are Ian Taylor, the chairman of Vitol, as well as Claude Dauphin, the former chief executive and chairman of Trafigura. Trafigura co-head of oil trading José Larocca and chief operating officer Mike Wainwright were also implicated in the alleged scheme. According to the documents, which summarize a plea deal reached in August with federal prosecutors, businessman Carlos Henrique Nogueira Herz testified that the executives knew of millions of dollars in bribes paid to Petrobras employees. An oil industry insider with decades of experience, Herz pleaded guilty in August to Brazilian prosecutors’ charges that he formed a “criminal group” that used his contacts in the sector to funnel bribes from Vitol and Trafigura to Petrobras employees from 2011 to 2014 in return for sweetheart fuel trades benefiting the commodity trading firms. If his accusations are proven, Herz’s testimony would up the ante in an ongoing Brazilian investigation of the commodity trading industry - codenamed Operation Without Limits - as it brings accusations of wrongdoing to the top echelons of some of the sector’s largest companies. Herz provided prosecutors with dozens of pages of emails and bank statements, reviewed by Reuters, that offered extensive detail on the bribery scheme as a whole. Herz provided no documentary evidence specifically linking Taylor to the allegedly illegal conduct. Herz said one of his business partners, a close personal associate of Taylor, informed him about the Vitol executive’s involvement in the bribery scheme. He provided documents showing Trafigura’s Wainwright was copied on an email referencing what Herz alleges were bribe payments. In his August testimony, Herz said Wainwright was involved in facilitating the payments. He did not provide any documentary evidence showing the involvement of Trafigura executives Dauphin and Larocca, whom he alleged were both aware of the bribery scheme but not directly involved. In his testimony, Herz said he knew of the executives’ knowledge and involvement in the alleged scheme in part because he personally set up a financial back channel in 2012 through which Trafigura bribes could be paid to Petrobras employees. He provided to prosecutors dozens of pages of emails and bank statements detailing what he alleged were aspects of those negotiations. The documents did not mention or include correspondence from Dauphin or Larocca. Reuters could not independently confirm Herz’s allegations about any of the executives. Reuters could not determine what advantage Herz gains by striking the plea bargain deal with prosecutors. However, defendants in Brazil are generally given reduced sanctions in return for their cooperation. A lawyer for Herz did not respond to requests for comment on Facebook and LinkedIn. The lawyer’s legal offices did not pick up multiple phone calls. Prosecutors did not respond to a request for comment. In a statement, Vitol said it would not be appropriate to comment on Herz’s testimony “beyond reiterating our zero tolerance policy in respect of bribery and corruption and our policy of cooperating fully with the relevant authorities in all the jurisdictions in which we operate.” Vitol said Taylor had nothing to add. Taylor, who was also CEO at the time of the alleged incidents, did not respond to a LinkedIn message sent by Reuters. Petrobras said it had immediately begun internal inquiries after learning about Herz’s plea bargain testimony and had removed employees named in the testimony from their positions. Trafigura said in a statement that it was aware of reports of Herz’ testimony but had not been contacted by Brazilian authorities in relation to the allegations. “Any suggestion that Trafigura’s current management knew that its payments would be used to make improper payments to employees of Petrobras is not correct,” the statement said. “Trafigura has a zero tolerance policy on bribery and corruption.” The firm did not make Wainwright and Larocca available for comment and the two men did not respond emails from Reuters. Dauphin, who stepped down as Trafigura CEO in 2014, died in 2015. ‘PRIVILEGED INFORMATION’ The investigation is part of a larger probe in Brazil, known as Operation Car Wash, which started in 2014 and has taken down scores of elite businessmen and politicians throughout Latin America who until recently were thought untouchable. The oil trading investigation became public knowledge in December when federal prosecutors alleged that Vitol, Trafigura, Glencore Plc GLEN.L and Mercuria Energy Group used intermediaries to pay at least $31 million in bribes to Petrobras employees to sell them oil at below-market rates and gain access to privileged information that gave them an edge over competitors when trading with the oil firm. The companies, which together control about 10 percent of the world’s daily oil consumption, have said they are cooperating with the Brazilian investigation. In his testimony, Herz said that his business partner, Bo Ljungberg, negotiated a back channel through which Vitol paid bribes to Petrobras employees in exchange for confidential Petrobras information. That information gave Vitol a significant advantage over competitors when trading fuel with the state-run firm, according to the documents. Ljungberg, a Swedish national, was indicted by Brazilian authorities in December for facilitating the alleged payments. He did not respond to Reuters messages on Facebook and LinkedIn requesting comment. An Interpol alert has been issued for Ljungberg. Brazilian prosecutors said in December he had returned to Sweden. Reuters has not been able to locate a lawyer for Ljungberg. Herz alleged that Taylor was directly involved in the negotiation of the bribes, which came to around 10 cents to 20 cents per barrel of oil exchanged between the companies. Herz said he was kept abreast of interactions between Taylor and Ljungberg via conversations with the Swede, with whom he was a co-owner of various firms active in the trading industry, according to the documents."

10.609772628006565," Petrobras new dividend policy positive, but will only go into effect in 2021: analysts RIO DE JANEIRO/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - While analysts liked a new dividend policy announced by Brazil’s state-controlled oil company, Petrobras, they expect it to go into effect only in 2021. In a securities filing on Wednesday evening, Petrobras said the board approved a change in its dividend policy. Petrobras will be allowed to pay up to 60% of its operational cash flow, excluding capital expenditures, as dividends when its gross debt falls below $60 billion. While Petrobras still has debt higher than $60 billion, the company expects to pay the legal minimum dividend of 25% of its net income, the company said. Petrobras’ current gross debt is at $101 billion, according to its second quarter financial statements. The company has been reducing its debt aggressively, selling assets and reducing costs. “The new policy is positive, because it means shareholders will make an effort to reduce the debt,” analysts at Bradesco BBI said in a note to clients. But the bank expects Petrobras to pay up to 60% of its cash flow only from 2022 on. Analysts at Credit Suisse think the new policy may go into effect in 2021. “We expect Petrobras to pay the minimum legal dividend in 2019 and 2020”, they said in a note to clients. Goldman Sachs analysts said the new policy improves predictability of the dividend flow, but also expect the gross debt to fall below $60 billion between 2021 and 2024, depending on the pace of asset sales."
13.315811700170336," Privatize Petrobras? Lofty ambition, higher hurdles BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil's influential finance minister has convinced President Jair Bolsonaro to consider the once-unthinkable step of privatizing state-owned oil company Petrobras PETR4.SA, but stiff political opposition could stifle any effort to sell the country's corporate crown jewel. Petrobras, or Petroleo Brasileiro SA, was founded in 1953 by former president Getulio Vargas following a nationalist campaign that began in the 1940s with the anthem “The oil is ours”. Selling the company would cap off the drive by Economy Minister Paulo Guedes, a Chicago school-trained economist and disciple of Thatcherite economics, to maximize privatization, deregulation and free-market activity. Guedes, who is influential in Bolsonaro’s right-wing administration, has said if it were up to him the state would sell “everything”. But he needs to build support because unlike other state assets, privatizing Petrobras requires congressional approval. The Brazilian government’s stake in Petrobras, including stock owned by development bank BNDES, is worth 135 billion reais ($33 billion) at current market prices. It is hard to estimate how much a rival would pay for a controlling premium or how much the government could raise from outright privatization. Still, proceeds from a sale would go a long way toward reducing Brazil’s budget deficit. It would also be the clearest signal yet that the government is serious about shrinking the state’s size and influence in business. But it is likely to remain a pipe dream, at least over the remaining 3-1/2 years of Bolsonaro’s first term. Petrobras is already raising cash by selling off non-core assets and the government has a long list of other firms it wants to privatize first. Also, politicians of many stripes oppose selling Petrobras, saying it would violate national sovereignty. “Petrobras is a successful example of a public company ... so I find it hard to make the case that privatizing it will be more profitable for Brazil,” said federal deputy Marcelo Ramos of the center-right Liberal Party. “Personally, I am against it and I don’t think there will be appetite for this in Congress,” he said. After a dispute about the sale of Petrobras subsidiaries, Brazil’s Supreme Court decided in June that congress must approve any sale of the oil company. Bolsonaro himself has said in the past that he opposed privatizing Petrobras because of its “strategic” nature. Last week, he said the government was ready to discuss a possible sale, and shares of Petrobras briefly jumped. “Everything is studied, everything is raised, everything is discussed,” Bolsonaro told reporters on Thursday last week. “Whether you privatize or not, you have to look at the cost-benefit, what is good for Brazil and what is not,” he said. A drive to privatize Petrobras “will embolden the opposition in Congress, which now has more support for its claim that Brazil is being handed over to businessmen and/or foreigners,” analysts at Guide Investimentos said in a client note last week. Currently, the government holds a 43% stake - 28% directly and 15% through BNDES - in what is the world’s ninth-largest oil company by market capitalization. That is a controlling stake because it is all voting stock, equivalent to 50.3% of common shares, according to information provided by Petrobras to securities industry regulators. Petrobras employs nearly 70,000 people and is Brazil’s largest company by revenue, operating profit and market value. It has taken steps to reduce its huge debt load in recent years, as it began to move beyond the black eye inflicted by its part in the nationwide graft-and- corruption scandal exposed by “Operation Car Wash.” But despite unprecedented moves to sell non-core assets, net debt still stands at around $70 billion. Shares jumped 6% on Wednesday last week after local media reports that the government wants to push a sale through in Bolsonaro’s first term, but have since slumped back along with the broader market. Last week, the government added nine companies to the list of state-controlled firms to be sold, including postal service Correios and Codesp, the company managing Latin America’s largest port in Santos. The government hopes to raise 1.3 trillion reais ($323 billion). Brazil has turned over state-controlled behemoths to the private sector before. In 1993 it sold steel giant CSN CSNA3.SA, in 1997 it unloaded miner Vale VALE3.SA and in 1998 telecommunications monopoly Telebras was auctioned off. The Telebras sale might offer an insight into the potential time frame for Petrobras. A change to the country’s constitution was made in 1995 and the company was not privatized for another three years. Brazil's power monopoly Eletrobras ELET6.SA also offers a lesson in playing the long game when privatizing Brazil's crown jewels. Its share price jumped last week when House Speaker Rodrigo Maia said Congress will renew efforts to privatize the company, almost exactly two years after former President Michel Temer announced his desire to privatize it. An executive at one of the largest international investors that acquired Petrobras assets recently said he did not expect the company to be privatized during Bolsonaro’s term, noting that other state assets are much easier to sell. “Maybe it’s a project for the next president,” he said, requesting anonymity to avoid upsetting government officials, while analysts at XP Investimentos said Petrobras is “probably a step too far” right now."
15.264270306942663," Exclusive: Brazil's Petrobras refineries sale lures trading companies, PetroChina, Saudi Aramco - sources SAO PAULO/RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil's planned privatization of eight Petroleo Brasileiro SA PETR4.SA refineries has lured several of the world's largest trading and oil companies as prospective bidders, two sources with knowledge of the matter said. Around 20 companies have signed non-disclosure agreements granting them access to the refineries’ data and signaling that they are considering a bid, the sources added, speaking on condition of anonymity to disclose private details of the sale. The first round of non-binding offers for four of the eight refineries Petrobras put on the block is due on Oct. 11, the sources said. The eight refineries have total capacity of 1.1 million barrels per day. Among the potential bidders are trading firms Vitol SA, Glencore PLC GLEN.L and Trafigura AG. Local companies Ultrapar Participações SA UGPA3.SA and Raizen, a joint venture of Brazil's Cosan SA CSAN3.SA and Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L, also signed non-disclosure agreements. Other companies interested, according to the sources, include PetroChina Co 601857.SS and Sinopec 600688.SS, which already has a Brazilian joint venture with Spain's Repsol REP.MC. Oil behemoth Saudi Aramco, which is planning one of the world's largest initial public offerings, is also looking at the refining units' numbers. The request to access the data room is just the first step of companies interested in the deal, and does not mean they will deliver bids on Oct. 11. Petrobras, PetroChina, Ultrapar, Sinopec and Vitol did not immediately comment on the matter. Raizen, Trafigura, Saudi Aramco and Glencore declined to comment. The deal, to be one of Petrobras’ largest divestitures ever, would transform Brazil’s oil industry and may raise around $18 billion, bankers working on the deal say. Refining has traditionally been state-owned in Brazil, triggering occasional calls for government price controls. At least partial privatization is widely seen as one of the best possible ways to bring real competition to the Brazilian oil industry. Antitrust watchdog CADE has already forced Petrobras to change its refinery sale process to boost competition, demanding the separate sale of each of the eight refineries. A single buyer will be barred from buying two of the largest refineries in the same area, whether it be the northeast, the south or the southeast. Petrobras is also carving out logistics assets, such as oil pipelines and terminals, to sell along with the refineries, one of the sources said. Most of the bidding groups are expected to include private pipeline operators, possibly including France's Engie ENGIE.PA and Canada's Brookfield BAMa.TO, one of the sources said, explaining that oil companies are reaching out to them. Both companies recently acquired Petrobras assets."

Brent crudes prices </LCOc1> were around $67 per barrel when Petrobras bought the options, but prices have been hit by an intensifying U.S.-China trade war among other factors and are now hovering around $57 per barrel. “The liquidation of these options is based on the significant reduction in cash flow uncertainties related to the execution of the company’s 2019 management and business plan, with a capex revision from $16 billion to the $10 to $11 billion range, $12.8 billion of cash coming in thanks to divestments and the beginning of a wide-ranging cost-cutting plan,” the company said. Petrobras has been steadily selling off billions of dollars of assets this year to reduce debt and sharpen focus on offshore oil exploration and production. Last week, it also cut its capex projection for 2019 significantly."

11.382679385721813," Brazil's Petrobras studies sale of power plants, CEO tells brokerage SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil's state-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA PETR4.SA is studying the creation of a subsidiary comprised of around 15 power plants, which could then be sold through an initial public offering, analysts at XP Investimentos said in a report sent to clients on Tuesday. Analysts at the Sao Paulo brokerage led by Gabriel Fonseca wrote the report to clients after a breakfast with Chief Executive Officer Roberto Castello Branco. The analysts also said in the report that Petrobras, as the firm is known, is considering partnering with oil firms present in Brazil’s so-called pre-salt offshore oil region to create a company composed of gas pipelines coming from the off-shore exploration areas. Petrobras could then exit the venture via a share offering, the report said. Petrobras operates 20 power plants with 6,000 megawatts in total capacity. Its divestment program has largely spared such assets so far, with the only divestiture being the sale of a 50% stake in the TermoBahia plant to France's Total SA TOTF.PA in 2017. Petrobras did not immediately reply to a request for comment about the CEO statements to XP. Petrobras has given a mandate to Credit Suisse to sell three gas pipelines in the pre-salt area. In April, sources told Reuters that Petrobras needed to secure an agreement with partners in the pre-salt region to go ahead with the sale. In addition to Petrobras, various international oil companies such as Royal Dutch Shell PLC RDSa.L, Total, and BP PLC BP.L are present in the pre-salt region. The report underscores the focus of Petrobras’ current administration, led by Castello Branco, on selling off assets to reduce debt and focus on oil exploration and production. Earlier in July, Petrobras signed an agreement with Brazil’s antitrust authority Cade to sell all its natural gas exploration and transportation assets. In a separate report published on Tuesday, analysts at Goldman Sachs cited Petrobras executives as saying that lifting costs at a platform in the pre-salt region had recently dipped to $4 a barrel, significantly lower than the $6 per barrel that the firm averaged in the pre-salt region in the second quarter. Brazil-listed preferred shares in Petrobras were up 1.9% in midday trade. The nation's Bovespa benchmark equities index .BVSP was up 1.4% as stocks recovered from a global rout on Monday."
15.373781268094216," Exclusive - Petrobras LPG unit seen attracting Mubadala, SHV, Itausa bids: sources SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Bidding groups led by Brazilian investment firm Itausa Investimentos SA ITSA4.SA, Abu Dhabi state investor Mubadala and SHV Energy of the Netherlands are expected to submit binding proposals to acquire state-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA PETR4.SA's LPG unit, two sources with knowledge of the matter said on Monday. Private equity firms CVC Capital Partners and Advent International have decided not to bid, the sources said ahead of a Wednesday deadline, after deciding the deal would be a better fit for strategic buyers. CVC and Advent declined to comment. The Brazilian government said in July it was discussing new rules to increase competitiveness in the natural gas industry, including liquid petroleum gas (LPG), in a move that is likely to affect bids for Liquigas, as the Petrobras unit is known. Itausa has partnered with local LPG distribution firm Copagaz to place a bid, the sources said, asking for anonymity to disclose private talks. SHV Energy, which distributes LPG in Brazil through its Supergasbras subsidiary, is also expected to bid in a consortium with local rival Consigaz, they said. Mubadala Investment Company PJSC is planning to deliver a binding offer as well, the people added. Itausa, SHV and Supergasbras declined to comment. Copagaz, Consigaz and Mubadala did not immediately comment on the matter. It remains unclear whether Ultrapar Participações SA UGPA3.SA will partner with another investor to bid for Liquigas. In 2016, Petrobras had agreed to sell Liquigas to Ultrapar, but the deal was blocked by Brazil's antitrust watchdog. Now, to comply with the rules Petrobras created to avoid new antitrust hurdles, Ultrapar needs to join up with other investors if it wants to bid. Those rules restrict any LPG distributor with a more than 10% market share from taking any more than a 30% stake in a bidding consortium. Petrobras is expected to raise between 2.5 billion reais ($630 million) and 3 billion reais ($755 million) with the sale of the unit. Petrobras received eight bids on the first round, on June 11. Banco Santander Brasil SA, which is advising Petrobras on the deal, declined to comment. The Liquigas sale is the next step in Petrobras CEO Roberto Castello Branco’s plan to sell assets and increase expenditures in core offshore exploration areas. So far this year, Petrobras has raised more than $12.7 billion, selling pipeline network company TAG for $8.7 billion and privatizing fuel distribution unit Petrobras Distribuidora SA BRDT3.SA through a share offering that raised $2.5 billion. Last month, the company also sold three oil fields for $1.5 billion."

9.966568206616898, EMERGING MARKETS-Brazil's real hits 6-week low as trade tensions intensify
9.966568206616898," Brazil's Petrobras reports long-awaited production boost RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA, or Petrobras, posted a long-awaited production boost in July after a disappointing June, as it ramped up production in the promising offshore “pre-salt” region. In a presentation to discuss record quarterly profits, Petrobras said it produced 2.76 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in July, up from 2.633 million in the second quarter. On July 28, it said, production hit a record of 3 million boepd. Last week, Petrobras posted lackluster second-quarter production figures and cut its 2019 guidance to 2.7 million boepd from 2.8 million, disappointing investors hungry for a long-promised production boost. The July figures came a day after Petrobras posted a record quarterly profit, thanks largely to major asset sales. Analysts generally saw non-recurring income and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) as in-line or slightly below expectations. But they cheered the execution of the divestments, which have brought nearly $13 billion into Petrobras coffers this year. Preferred shares of Petrobras rose 3.7% in afternoon trade, after climbing almost 5% earlier in the day. “We have a mixed evaluation of Petrobras’ second quarter results,” wrote analysts at XP Investimentos. “Nonetheless, we highlight as positives the generation of cash and reduction of debt during the quarter.” One potential area of concern were June production figures, which were in fact below expectations. On Friday, during a Petrobras call with analysts, Brazilian oil regulator ANP said Petrobras June production came to 2.432 million boepd. Among the main reasons the ANP pointed to for the June reduction was a stoppage at Petrobras’ Cidade de Mangaratiba FPSO, a type of ship used to produce and process oil. Petrobras’ exploration and production head, Carlos Alberto Pereira de Oliveira, also pointed to other one-off issues. Executives also warned on the call that any dividend payments would be minimal until Petrobras reaches its goal of attaining a net debt to EBITDA ratio of 1.5. That ratio currently stands at 2.69. To reach that goal, the executives said they would continue with aggressive divestments, such as the multi-billion sale of eight refineries. Petrobras downstream head Anelise Lara said in a call with analysts that Petrobras had received many expressions of interest in the refineries from trading firms, local distribution firms and international oil companies. The world’s largest trading firms, including Vitol SA and Glencore PLC, are currently under investigation by U.S. and Brazilian authorities for a massive kickback scheme involving Petrobras. Lara said in a press conference that Petrobras had concluded an internal investigation into the matter, and said no corrupt schemes were still occurring in the trading unit. She said the firm would allow the trading firms involved in the matter to buy the refineries."

9.966568206616898," Brazil's Petrobras posts highest-ever quarterly profit, boosted by asset sales RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian state-run oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro SA posted its highest ever quarterly profit on Thursday and handily beat analysts’ estimates, thanks in large part to billions of reais in asset sales. In a securities filing, Petrobras, as the firm is commonly known, said second quarter net profit came to 18.87 billion reais ($4.92 billion). That was well above the Refinitiv consensus estimate of 8.06 billion reais at current exchange rates. Adjusted for non-recurring items, net income would have come to 5.2 billion reais, Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco said in written remarks accompanying the results. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), in some ways a more closely watched indicator given Petrobras’ many impairments and one-off gains in recent years, hit market estimates. Petrobras said EBITDA came to 32.67 billion reais, almost exactly in line with the Refinitiv estimate of 32.7 billion. Taken as a whole, the results show that Petrobras’ recent acceleration in asset sales is bearing tangible fruit. Castello Branco, who took charge in January, has made selling off non-core assets in order to reduce debt a key part of his overall strategy, a tactic that has been cheered by investors. Overall in 2019, the company has received some $12.764 billion from asset sales, including $8.722 billion from its sale of gas pipelines to France’s Engie SA in the second quarter, it said in the filing. Largely as a result of those sales, Petrobras’ net debt to EBITDA ratio fell to 2.69 at the end of the second quarter, down from 3.19 at the end of the first quarter. Petrobras’ current goal is to bring that ratio down to 1.5 in 2020. In Castello Branco’s comments, the CEO attributed much of the profit boost to factors “beyond (Petrobras’) control,” such as high crude prices </LCOc1> and an improving real to dollar exchange rate. Castello Branco also re-affirmed the company’s dedication to asset sales saying the so-called initial ‘teaser’ phase for four refineries worth billions of dollars is set to be launched next month. He added in the comments that “we don’t need to own” midstream assets. Earlier on Thursday, Reuters reported that Petrobras was studying a mass transfer of employees out of Transpetro, which is responsible for most of the firm’s midstream assets. The company would look to partially and wholly reduce its 37.5% stake it fuel distribution unit Petrobras Distribuidora SA, which it privatized via a share offering in July, he said. One potential concern in the results was a significant downward revision in forecasted 2019 capital expenditure from $16 billion to $10-$11 billion. Castello Branco said that figure does not include bids for offshore exploration and production in blocs in Brazil scheduled for later this year."

11.684783074405086," Exclusive: Brazil's Petrobras studies downsizing logistics unit RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian state-run oil firm Petrobras is studying a mass transfer of employees out of its Transpetro logistics unit, according to a document seen by Reuters, in a sign the company may be gearing up to privatize additional assets. The human resources departments of Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the company is formally known, and Transpetro are developing an “action plan for the evaluation and possible return of (employees) ceded to Transpetro from the parent company,” according to the document, dated July 24. It is common at Petrobras for employees to be hired by the parent company and later transferred to a subsidiary. Such workers technically remain employed by the parent company, and are transferred back to Petrobras if a unit is privatized. A similar process occurred at fuel distribution unit Petrobras Distribuidora SA, according to two sources familiar with the matter, before it was privatized via share offering this month. Transpetro had 6,435 employees at the end of 2016, 1,090 of whom had been “ceded” to the company by Petrobras, according to the company. “After individual evaluations, human resources will consolidate the information and, together with executive managers, come up with a return plan for employees,” reads the internal Petrobras document about workers ceded to Transpetro. Asked about the plans, Petrobras said in a statement it is “constantly carrying out evaluations of the profile and quantity of its personnel, taking into account goals, competencies and knowledge.” Petrobras Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco, who took the reins in January, is working to sell midstream and downstream assets in a bid to reduce debt and sharpen the focus on offshore oil exploration and production. In April, Petrobras agreed to sell a collection of gas pipelines to France’s Engie SA for $8.6 billion. The firm is also looking to sell eight refineries in a process Castello Branco said could fetch $15 billion. While the refineries are not part of the Transpetro unit, formally known as Petrobras Transporte SA, Petrobras will be selling a number of associated pipelines and terminals, which are part of Transpetro. Transpetro operates over 7,500 km (4,660 miles) of oil pipelines, according to its website, and has a fleet of over 50 ships, among other assets. It reported net revenue of 10.4 billion reais ($1.8 billion) in 2018, contributing about 2% of the parent company’s revenue."

Meanwhile, a second Iranian ship, the Termeh, which set sail from Paranaguá port two days ago, was on Monday heading to the southern Brazilian port of Imbituba, where it is due to pick up a shipment of corn before heading back to Iran. The ships were stranded after Brazil’s state oil company, known as Petrobras, refused to sell them bunker fuel in the wake of U.S. sanctions against Iran. Petrobras eventually relented in the face of a supreme court ruling. The ships’ departures mark the end of a longstanding impasse. The Iranian vessels had been at the port of Paranaguá for more than 50 days, said law firm Kincaid Mendes Vianna, which represents the company that chartered the ships. The vessels are due to return to Iran carrying a load of 100,000 tonnes of corn worth about 100 million reais ($26.5 million), the firm said."
5.318451124668618," Odebrecht unit signs first post-'Car Wash' contract with Brazil's Petrobras RIO DE JANEIRO, July 29 (Reuters) - Brazil’s Petrobras has signed a two-year contract to lease a drilling rig from Ocyan, formerly known as Odebrecht Oleo e Gas, an executive told Reuters, in the first deal between the firms since a corruption scandal erupted five years ago. Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the state-run oil firm is known, formally selected Ocyan and two other companies in a recent tender for six drilling rigs, Ocyan Chief Executive Roberto Simões said in a Friday interview. Petrobras awarded one of the rig contracts to Ocyan, with three going to Constellation Oil Services Holding SA and two to Brazil’s Petroserv SA, Simões said. He did not disclose values. The deal is significant as Petrobras and Odebrecht, Ocyan’s parent company, are at the center of Operation Cash Wash, a massive ongoing corruption probe in which authorities have unearthed billions of dollars of bribes. Odebrecht was banned from signing any new contracts with Petrobras until mid-2018, when the state-run oil firm decided to conditionally allow some business dealings with Odebrecht, following improvements in the conglomerate’s compliance programs. Simões portrayed the rig contract as an opportunity for Ocyan to turn the page, calling it “enormously symbolic.” Petrobras declined to comment. Petroserv did not respond to a request for comment. Constellation has previously announced its winning bid. Ocyan, which changed names in January 2018, is a fraction of its former size. Its corporate offices are in a largely vacant building north of Rio de Janeiro’s financial district. It now employs 2,000 employees, down from 6,000, Simões said, but it is looking to rebuild. One of the firm’s two operating FPSOs - massive ships used for offshore oil production and processing - lies in the Bauna cluster, which Petrobras recently sold to Australia’s Karoon Energy Ltd. A Karoon executive told Reuters last week that the firm plans to boost production at Bauna by over 60%, which could bode well for Ocyan, Simões said. Ocyan also has its eyes on Karoon’s nearby Neon discovery, where, he predicted, Karoon would launch service tenders soon. Ocyan is also looking to participate in a FPSO tender for Brazilian oil company Enauta Participacoes SA in the Atlanta field - which Simões expects to be launched by the end of the year - and the company is also looking abroad for opportunities in nations such as Guyana. While Ocyan is examining two large FPSO tenders recently launched by Petrobras, Mero III and Itapu, Simões said those projects - which will require billions of dollars in expenditures - may be too large for the company.

6.17120175134694," Iranian vessels stranded in Brazil to set sail on Saturday -harbor workers SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Two Iranian ships stranded for weeks at a Brazilian port will be able to set sail on Saturday after the firm chartering the vessels obtained court rulings obliging state oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA to refuel them. The ships were stranded after Brazil’s state oil company, also known as Petrobras, refused to sell them bunker fuel in the wake of U.S. sanctions against Iran.. The refueling of one ship, the Bavand, started at around 5 a.m. local time and that vessel is expected to depart at 9 p.m. and head directly to Iran with a load of corn, a spokeswoman for the union of harbor pilots, Sinprapar, told Reuters by telephone. According to the union, the refueling of the other ship, the Termeh, began at 1 a.m. and that vessel is expected to move at 1 p.m., bound for the port of Imbituba, where it is supposed to be loaded with corn for export. On Friday, Petrobras Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco told Reuters in an interview that the company would obey a Supreme Court order to refuel the Iranian grain vessels. The refueling marks the end of a longstanding impasse sparked by Petrobras’ refusal to refuel the bulk carriers, said law firm Kincaid Mendes Vianna, which represents the company that chartered the ships. The Iranian vessels had been at the port of Paranaguá for more than 50 days, the law firm said in a statement on Saturday, and will this weekend return to Iran carrying a total load of 100,000 tonnes of corn worth about 100 million reais ($26.5 million) (This story corrects spelling of Brazilian port to Imbituba instead of Imbibuta, paragraph 4)."
5.175850680180755," Petrobras cuts 2019 output target in push for 'credibility' RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil’s state-run oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro SA cut its 2019 production target, sending its shares lower on concerns about how quickly the firm will be able to ramp up production. Petrobras, as the firm is known, now expects output to average 2.7 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), in line with 2018, scrapping an earlier forecast that it could grow to 2.8 million boepd. In comments to Reuters, Petrobras Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco said he still saw a chance within the margin of the new target for production to grow this year and next. He said the lower target was an effort to recover credibility. “Transparency is always better,” said Castello Branco, who was appointed in January. “Petrobras has a history of promising and not delivering, and that’s why I made a point of lowering the target and setting a more realistic one.” Along with the lower target, Petrobras said in a Friday securities filing that second-quarter oil and gas production rose 3.8% from the prior quarter to 2.633 million boepd. The increase fell short of investor expectations for the company, which is dramatically ramping up production in “pre-salt” fields, tapping billions of barrels of oil beneath a layer of salt under the ocean floor far off the Brazilian coast. Petrobras’ preferred shares in Sao Paulo were down 2.5% on Friday afternoon. “While today’s news bring some downside risk to our 2019 estimates due to the delay in ramp up of production in some platforms in Buzios field, such delays will likely not change the production outlook for 2020,” wrote Goldman Sachs analysts, adding they were holding their positive view on the stock. Petrobras has brought seven new platforms online since last year in the pre-salt Buzios and Lula fields and post-salt Tartaruga Verde field. Yet the company’s output is little changed from a year ago due to the sale of some assets and declining production in its more mature fields. Castello Branco said the firm intends to stabilize production in Brazil’s offshore Campos Basin, home to many of Petrobras’ more mature assets. He said the firm hopes to keep production in Campos at around 1 million barrels per day. Still, he said, the pre-salt area will be Petrobras’ main growth play. Over 60% of 2019 production will likely come from pre-salt, he told Reuters. Lifting costs at the pre-salt fields are at a low $6 per barrel, he said."

2.390183137597481," Australia's Karoon eyes production boost after snapping up Petrobras field RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Karoon Energy Ltd aims to boost production by more than 60% at an oilfield it is purchasing from Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the independent Australian firm dramatically expands its operations in Brazil, an executive said on Thursday. Petrobras, as the Brazilian state-run oil firm is known, on Wednesday announced the sale of the Bauna cluster in Brazil’s Santos Basin for $665 million to Karoon, as well as the sale of the Pampo and Enchova shallow-water clusters to UK-based Trident Energy for $1.051 billion including future payments. While still subject to regulatory approvals, the deals represent a significant step forward in Petrobras’ aggressive drive to divest non-core assets and re-focus on exploration and production in Brazil’s deepwater, ‘pre-salt’ area. It was also a coup for Karoon. Shares in the firm closed up some 12.4% higher on Wednesday, its biggest intraday gain in over five years. In a Thursday phone interview, Tim Hosking, Karoon’s general manager for South America, said the firm aimed to increase production at Bauna to 33,000 barrels per day (bpd) by 2022, up from around 20,000 bpd currently. He said he expected the purchase to be formalized within 10 months. To complete the acquisition, according to a corporate presentation, Karoon will use $228 million of its own cash and the firm has access to a $250 million credit line from ING. The firm also intends to raise capital via new and existing shareholders, the presentation said. In January, Reuters reported that Karoon and Rio de Janeiro-based oil firm Petro Rio SA had placed binding offers for Bauna. Brazil-listed common shares in Petro Rio were off 3.5% on Thursday. Hosking said Karoon will take advantage of operational synergies between Bauna and the company’s nearby Neon and Goiá discoveries, formerly known as Kangaroo and Echidna. Karoon aims to present a development plan for Neon to Brazil’s ANP oil regulator by the end of August, Hosking said. The field should produce 25,000 to 28,000 bpd by 2023, he added. Petrobras, by far Brazil’s largest oil producer, is selling off hundreds of relatively mature onshore and offshore oilfields, attracting a number of independent oil firms and private equity firms eager to snap up assets. Karoon will continue examining the assets that come up for sale, Hosking told Reuters. “Certainly, Brazil is a key country for growth,” he said. “If we find interesting opportunities for the company, we’ll go for them.”"
2.390183137597481," Brazil court orders Petrobras to refuel Iran grain vessels BRASILIA/RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil’s top court on Thursday ordered state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA to refuel two Iranian grain vessels stranded on the Brazilian coast due to U.S. sanctions holding up sales of fuel needed for their return trips. Chief Justice Dias Toffoli overturned a lower court ruling that allowed Petrobras, as the oil major is known, to refrain from fueling the vessels. Petrobras had denied service, citing the risk of consequences from U.S. sanctions. However, the risk is reduced if it is simply obeying a Supreme Court ruling, said a company source who was not authorized to publicly comment on the matter. The Petrobras press office has not been officially notified about the court’s decision, it said. The company said it will evaluate its options once it learns the details of the decision. Brazilian Foreign Minister Ernesto Araujo told reporters in Brasilia that the legal process must be followed in the case, but Petrobras faces risks if it violates U.S. sanctions. In his decision, Toffoli said the bulk carriers Bavand and Termeh are under contract to Brazilian company Eleva Química, which is not covered by U.S. sanctions, and so are entitled to receive the fuel and proceed on their return trips. Eleva Química did not return a request for comment. Toffoli said the Petrobras refusal to refuel the ships would cause economic losses for Eleva and Brazil. Iran is a major buyer of Brazilian commodities and the top destination for its corn exports this year. The country also buys Brazilian soybeans, sugar, meat and other products. The ships Bavand and Termeh are among five Iranian vessels testing a new trade route, bringing urea to Brazil and returning to Iran with corn. Iran is trying to boost sales of petrochemicals like urea as sanctions hammer its oil industry. For two other Iranian ships at Brazilian ports, MV Delruba and Ganj, it is not clear if they will need to refuel to get back to Iran after unloading their urea and loading corn. The fifth vessel, Daryabar, managed to leave Brazil and is currently bypassing South Africa’s Cape of Good Hope, according to Refinitiv’s Eikon ship tracking system. All five ships are on the U.S. sanctions list. The sanctions also bar trading of urea, but not food."

Final binding offers for Liquigás are due by Aug. 7, Castello Branco told journalists in Sao Paulo, where he was formalizing a share offering that sold about a third of fuel distribution unit Petrobras Distribuidora SA this week. That share sale, which effectively privatized the country’s biggest gas station chain, brought total divestments at Petrobras, as the oil major is known, to $15 billion and Castello Branco said “there is a lot more to come.” Liquigás is 100% owned by Petrobras and last year had revenue of 5.6 billion reais ($1.48 billion). The gas distribution company has 20 million clients and 5,000 points of sale in Brazil. An earlier attempt to sell the natural gas unit was blocked by antitrust agency Cade, which cited competition concerns to reject an agreement to sell Liquigás to Brazil’s Grupo Ultra."

The offering of Petrobras Distribuidora SA was priced at 24.50 reais per share, according to two sources with knowledge of the matter. Final pricing implied a discount of less than 1% to the closing price of the fuel unit on the Sao Paulo stock exchange on Tuesday. Petrobras is expected to fully exercise the over-allotment provisions, selling a 33.75% stake and raising 9.63 billion reais ($2.55 billion) with the sale, one of the people added, asking for anonymity to disclose non-public information. Final results of the over-allotment provisions will be publicized by Aug. 28. Each of Branco’s three predecessors discussed privatizing Petrobras Distribuidora. The share offering of the gas station chain underscores the new government’s commitment to an array of public asset sales in industries ranging from energy to finance. The fuel distributor, also known as BR Distribuidora, owns 17.7% of all gas stations in Brazil, according to oil regulatory agency ANP data. Its closest rival is Ipiranga, controlled by Ultrapar Participações SA, with 14% of gas stations. The sale of state-owned assets is expected to drive mergers, acquisitions and share offerings in Brazil in the second half of the year, bankers and investors said, after a slower-than-expected first half. Petrobras management, appointed by President Jair Bolsonaro in January, is aggressively exiting downstream and midstream businesses to sharpen its focus on offshore oil exploration and production. Analysts at UBS AG and Banco Bradesco SA have “buy” and “outperform” ratings on Petrobras Distribuidora, with price targets of 30 and 35 reais, respectively. Both say privatization will free the firm of some onerous legal obligations. “Personnel costs should fall after privatization,” wrote UBS analysts led by Luiz Carvalho. The offering was led by the investment banking units of JPMorgan Chase & Co, Citigroup Inc, Itau Unibanco Holding SA, Bank of America Corp, Credit Suisse Group AG and Banco Santander Brasil SA."

Petrobras, as the company is widely known, will effectively privatize its listed subsidiary Petrobras Distribuidora SA in the secondary share offering set to price after markets close. The parent company plans to auction off 25% of Petrobras Distribuidora shares, which would bring in roughly 7.43 billion reais ($1.97 billion) at Monday’s closing price. That percentage could increase to 33.75% via overallotment provisions. Supplementary and additional allotments will be allocated by Aug. 28, according to the prospectus. As Petrobras now holds 71.25% of the fuel distributor’s shares, the unit will cease to be a state-run company.

Petrobras, as the Brazilian state-run oil company in known, will fetch nearly $1 billion, two of the sources said. The firm received two offers in a final re-bid this month, the same sources said, declining to name the second bidder. In a previous round, Brazilian independent oil firm Ouro Preto Oleo e Gas had joined British-based Seacrest Capital and Anglo-French firm Perenco to deliver a bid. Trident’s bid for the Pampo and Enchova shallow-water fields has yet to be confirmed by Petrobras’ board of directors, which is scheduled to meet next week, the two sources said. Petrobras and Trident did not immediately reply to requests for comment. Petrobras put the oil fields up for sale nearly a year ago as part of a wider effort to divest assets and cut debt, but the Enchova and Pampo sale process has proved to be complex due to rules requiring competitive re-bids for certain asset sales. Both oil fields produced almost 39,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, according to July 2018 figures, making them the largest mature production asset that Petrobras is working to sell in its $35 billion, five-year divestment program."

-9.919413020926363," Iran grain ships stuck in Brazil without fuel due to U.S. sanctions SAO PAULO/RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Two Iranian vessels have been stranded for weeks at Brazilian ports, unable to head back to Iran due to lack of fuel, which state-run oil firm Petrobras refuses to sell them due to sanctions imposed by the United States. The vessels Bavand and Termeh came to Brazil a couple months ago carrying urea, a petrochemical product used as fertilizer. They were expected to load corn and return to Iran, but lacked enough fuel for the trip, the port operator in Paranaguá told Reuters. Food is not covered by U.S. sanctions, and Iran is one of the largest buyers of Brazil’s agricultural commodities, importing more than 2.5 million tonnes of Brazilian corn so far this year — more than any other country. However, that trade is not usually carried by ships flying the Iranian flag. When the vessels are Iranian, they usually come with enough fuel to return without refueling. Bavand and Termeh were among several ships owned by Iranian state company Sapid Shipping Co that have brought urea to Brazil this year and returned with corn. Urea is included in the U.S. sanctions, but a local company decided to take that business. Iran is working to boost petrochemical sales as sanctions hammer its oil industry. The Brazilian urea market was one target. The main supplier of bunker fuel for ships in Brazil is Transpetro, a subsidiary of Petroleo Brasileiro SA PETR4.SA, or Petrobras, as the state-run company is known. Petrobras confirmed it had declined to fuel the ships and cited the sanctions. “The vessels were included by the United States in the Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List (SDN),” said Petrobras in a statement, adding that selling the fuel would make it subject to penalties since it operates in the United States and has shares listed in New York. Sapid Shipping tried unsuccessfully in Paraná courts to force Petrobras to fuel the ships, according to a person familiar with the case, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Sapid did not respond to requests for comment. It was not clear whether the Iranian ships had tried to buy bunker fuel from smaller suppliers in Brazil. “The vessels are stuck there. Nobody is able to intermediate the sale of bunker fuel for them,” said a fertilizer trader familiar with the matter, who also requested anonymity. If the vessels are unable to find a fuel company that does not follow U.S. sanctions, a solution of last resort could be for Iran to send a ship with fuel resupply to Brazil. The ships are at bay in the Paranaguá port in southern Paraná state, the port’s press service confirmed to Reuters. The Bavand is loaded with 50,000 tonnes of corn, while the Termeh remains scheduled to load 66,000 tonnes of corn. Before Paranaguá, the ships moored at the Imbituba port in Santa Catarina state, where they unloaded the urea. Brazilian grain exporters association ANEC expressed dismay at the quandary of the Iranian vessels at Paranaguá. “The vessels from all other exporters continue to operate without problems. I don’t expect any impact from this to that trade. Food is out of sanctions,” said ANEC’s director Sérgio Mendes. Brazil’s right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro has worked to forge closer relations with U.S. President Donald Trump as well as Iranian foe Israel."

-14.438504377146819," Exclusive: Petrobras eyes exit from Brazil bourse's good governance program - sources RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian state-run oil firm Petrobras is considering an end to its participation in a program certifying good governance and limited political interference in state companies set up by the Sao Paulo stock exchange, two sources told Reuters. Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco is pushing the possibility of exiting the Distinction in Governance Program for State-Run Firms, established by exchange operator B3 SA B3SA3.SA, said the people familiar with deliberations, who requested anonymity to discuss confidential matters. They said Castello Branco believed the measures demanded by the program add little tangible value to the firm’s compliance efforts and divert resources that could be better used. In a statement to Reuters, Petrobras did not confirm the deliberations, although it said its continued participation in the program would depend on “the best interests of the company and its shareholders, always seeking more efficiency without, however, reducing internal controls.” Petrobras added that improvements to its compliance protocols have “stood out” in recent years and that many requirements of the B3 program are already part of Brazilian law, so leaving the program would not necessarily weaken the company’s corporate governance. B3 declined to comment. Petroleo Brasileiro SA PETR4.SA, as the firm is formally known, has spent years trying to recover from one of the world's biggest ever corporate graft scandals. A five-year-old corruption investigation, known as Operation Car Wash, has uncovered billions of dollars of bribes and overpriced contracts between Petrobras and engineering firms – a key reason the stock exchange created the governance program in 2015. “Naturally such a move could raise some concerns among shareholders and other interested parties,” said Andriei Beber, a professor of corporate governance at the Getulio Vargas Foundation. “I don’t think it would have so much impact, but it could represent backsliding – and on something very dear to markets and especially minority investors.” According to the sources, Castello Branco has said Petrobras should compare itself to other oil majors, rather than the other constituents of the program, which significantly differ from Petrobras in scale and industry. One of the sources said the most important aspects of the program are already written into Petrobras bylaws. In 2017, Petrobras celebrated its certification under the program as a sign of its commitment to improved governance. The program lays out higher standards of transparency, internal audits and apolitical leadership, including a requirement that at least 30 percent of board members be independent. The Car Wash probe revealed a longstanding pattern of politically appointed managers at Petrobras offering inflated contracts to suppliers in exchange for political bribes – a practice eventually exposed at a range of Brazilian state firms. Petrobras says it has cleaned up its act, thanks in part to a robust compliance program. But the firm is still the target of active investigations, including a far-reaching probe of its commodities trading division, which has drawn the attention of the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation and federal prosecutors in New York. This month, the head of compliance at Petrobras, Rafael Gomes, resigned from his post, citing personal reasons. It was the second exit of a Petrobras compliance chief in just over a year. In addition to Petrobras, its fuel distribution unit Petrobras Distribuidora SA BRDT3.SA, state lender Banco do Brasil SA BBAS3.SA and its insurance unit BB Seguridade Participacoes SA BBSE3.SA and power companies Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA ELET6.SA and Cia Paranaense de Energia SA CPLE6.SA have been certified by the Distinction in Governance Program for State-Run Firms."

Among the possible bidders for the firm’s Pampo and Enchova shallow-water fields are Trident Energy, backed by private equity firm Warburg Pincus, and a group composed of Brazilian independent oil firm Ouro Preto Oleo e Gas, UK-based Seacrest Capital and Anglo-French firm Perenco, said the sources. A successful sale of the fields would help Petrobras, as the firm is commonly known, in its ongoing drive to reduce debt, a key goal of Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco. However, the drawn-out nature of the sale has underlined what potential buyers characterize as a bureaucratic and complex divestment process. Rio de Janeiro-based oil firm Petro Rio SA is also in the running, added the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss confidential matters. The process kicked off in mid-2018, when Petrobras entered exclusive talks to sell the asset to a consortium composed of Ouro Preto Oleo e Gas and private equity firm EIG Global Energy Partners. In December, Petrobras opened a final re-bidding round, as mandated by federal rules, in which competing parties could raise or lower their offers as long as they kept the same contractual terms as those agreed upon in the bilateral negotiations. The Ouro Preto group took advantage of that opportunity to lower its own bid, provoking Petrobras to walk away from the table. Petrobras then began bilateral negotiations with Trident. In June, Petrobras opened a second re-bidding round after agreeing upon terms with Trident, Reuters reported, and received bids surpassing $1 billion in value. At that point, Ouro Preto presented the highest offer in a re-jigged consortium. Perenco and Seacrest joined the new group, with EIG exiting, the sources said. However, the Trident group challenged the Ouro Preto bid, arguing that the change in the other consortium - with Perenco taking an equity stake - violated the rules of the tender, the sources said. Petrobras then annulled the results of the round and set a new re-bid date, saying publicly it was clarifying the tender rules to the involved parties. Trident and Warburg Pincus declined to comment. All other parties did not respond to requests for comment. The Ouro Preto group disagreed vehemently with Petrobras’ decision, believing its bid followed the rules, three of the sources said. The bid was accepted by Petrobras before the process was scuttled, the sources added. Both parties are considering participating in the new bidding round, according to the sources. Pampo and Enchova produced almost 39,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, according to July 2018 figures, making it the largest mature production asset in Petrobras’ divestment portfolio."

Petrobras, as the company is widely known, is dividing its marketing and trading division into a domestic unit and an international unit, the company said in a statement, after two sources told Reuters of the changes. “Petrobras is splitting its Marketing and Trading area into Trading in Foreign Markets (CME) and Trading in Domestic Markets (CMI),” the company said. “The change aims to align Petrobras with movements in the sector and bring more synergies, innovation and agility to its trading unit.” Petrobras is ramping up oil and gas production in Brazil’s so-called pre-salt area, located off the nation’s southeastern coast, which in turn has led the firm to eye new export markets. In May, Reuters reported that Petrobras would store crude in China to better respond to immediate demand by local refineries. Last week, Petrobras’ head of downstream operations said exports could increase by over a third “in the coming years.” While Petrobras’ trading area has been divided principally by product - such as crude and various fuels - the main division will now be between domestic and international markets, said the sources, who requested anonymity as they were not permitted to speak publicly. The reorganization also comes as Petrobras’ trading operation confronts a major corruption scandal that has engulfed major commodities trading houses, including Glencore PLC, Trafigura, Mercuria Energy Group and Vitol SA. In December, Brazilian prosecutors charged 14 people, including six former Petrobras employees, with taking part in a multimillion-dollar scheme to defraud Petrobras. In June, Reuters reported that Petrobras managers, at least one of whom is still at the company, ignored previous warnings from employees about a fuel broker who prosecutors now say was a key actor in the scheme."

Speaking at an event in Rio de Janeiro, Petrobras Chief Institutional Relations Officer Roberto Furian Ardenghy said fuel distribution firms, oil producers with operations in Brazil and trading firms could buy some refineries it has on the block. “Today, we’re looking at three segments that could be interested in our facilities. The first segment is distributors, our friends at Raizen, and other companies that are here,” Ardenghy said. Petrobras is planning to sell off eight of its refineries in a process Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco has said could raise $15 billion. Castello Branco on Thursday said one of the refineries could be sold by the end of the year. The possible buyers Ardenghy mentioned are essentially those forecast by analysts.

In May, Reuters reported that Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the company is formally known, planned to store some of its crude in China to be able to flexibly respond to demand by local refineries. As part of that effort, Petrobras leased storage facilities in the port city of Qingdao with a capacity of 2 million barrels of oil."

Petrobras, as the company is known, said in a securities filing that it would sell the refineries Rnest, in the state of Pernambuco; Rian, in Bahia; Repar in Parana; and Refap in Rio Grande do Sul.

At a Sao Paulo stock exchange event, Castello Branco also said Petróleo Brasileiro S.A., as the company is formally known, planned to sell at least one refinery this year and was expecting to receive binding offers for its liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) distribution unit as soon as August. Petrobras, which is selling tens of billions of dollars of assets to cut debt and refocus on deepwater offshore exploration and production, has already completed some major sales in gas distribution. In 2016, Petrobras sold its NTS gas pipeline unit in southern Brazil to a consortium led by Brookfield Asset Management SA for $5.2 billion. In April it sold its TAG unit in northern Brazil to France's Engie SA ENGIE.PA for $8.6 billion. “We’re going to open up space, selling companies, getting out of transportation. We’ve already started this process, selling NTS and TAG,” Castello Branco said. “We’re going deeper with pipeline sales. We’re getting out of gas distribution.” Regarding the company's LPG distribution unit Liquigas, Castello Branco said Petrobras had already begun making a short-list from the non-binding offers it has received. The company had agreed to sell the unit in 2016 to Brazil's Ultrapar Participacoes SA UGPA3.SA, but the deal was blocked by Cade, Brazil's antitrust body. “We hope to receive binding offers at the beginning of August,” he said. The company in April presented a plan to sell off eight refineries, in what is likely to be one of its largest ever divestments."

Petrobras, as the oil company is known, said in a securities filing that it decided to make the payment following a decision by a U.S. court in Texas denying its request to cancel the result of an earlier arbitration in Holland opened by Vantage after Petrobras terminated a drilling contract in 2015. Petrobras argued at the time that the contract had been awarded to the U.S. company “by way of corruption,” according to findings by Brazil’s Operation Car Wash anti-corruption investigation. Vantage denied the accusation and said the contract was “wrongfully terminated. It won the arbitration in Holland, but Petrobras appealed the ruling in the Texas court.Petrobras had also appealed the court decision to uphold the arbitration ruling. Petrobras said on Friday it decided to pay the amount to end interests in the condemnation and to free up some assets that had been frozen by the Dutch arbitration as a way to force it to comply with the ruling.

Petrobras, as the oil company is known, said earlier on Thursday that bids for the Pampo and Enchova shallow water fields surpassed $1 billion but did not disclose the highest offer or winner. Ouro Preto, led by Rodolfo Landim, former president of OGX, a now bankrupt oil and gas company led by one-time billionaire Eike Batista, has stakes in several basins throughout Brazil. It was competing against at least one other bidder: Trident Energy, a Warburg Pincus-backed firm specializing in mid-life oil assets, which delivered an offer in March. Together, the fields produce almost 39,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, according to July 2018 figures, making them the largest mature production asset in Petrobras’ divestment portfolio. Both are located off the coast of Rio de Janeiro. Petrobras has been in talks with potential buyers for these oil clusters for roughly one year. In July 2018, it entered exclusive talks with Ouro Preto, but the unlisted company later lowered the bid, allowing Trident to take the lead. Under Petrobras’ divestments rules, however, it was required to open a final bid on June 5.

Olga Pontes, Odebrecht’s compliance director, says Odebrecht Engenharia e Construcao (OEC) should be able to resume its relationship with Petrobras because of steps taken by the conglomerate to improve governance and compliance in the wake of a 2016 leniency deal tied to a corruption scandal. Odebrecht along with other firms was ensnared in a major global corruption investigation into billions of dollars in bribes that were paid to win contracts with Petrobras in the last two decades. Pontes said Odebrecht and Petrobras representatives will meet in the next few days, when the conglomerate’s compliance and governance reforms will be presented to the oil company. Brazil’s largest banks are negotiating a potential out-of-court debt restructuring with Odebrecht, Banco Bradesco SA said on Tuesday. With a total debt of approximately 70 billion reais ($18.23 billion), Odebrecht has been trying to avoid the same fate of its sugar and ethanol unit, Atvos Agroindustrial Participacoes SA, which filed for bankruptcy at the end of May. “We are not cleared yet to provide engineering work (to Petrobras).

Petrobras considers a favorable judgment in this case, along with the court’s ruling last week that state-run firms do not need congressional approval to sell off their subsidiaries, as the legal pillars of its divestment plan to reduce its high level of debt, one of the highest in the sector. Petrobras, as the company is known, says the plan will allow it to focus on offshore exploration and production in its pre-salt area, where billions of barrels of oil are trapped under a thick layer of salt offshore. Supreme Court justices will deliberate on Wednesday whether the proposed governance rules related to the sale of exploration contracts by the company, which has been challenged by Brazil’s Workers’ Party, should be maintained or repealed. Like the case involving congressional approval for asset sales, the one addressing exploration contracts involves a competitive procedure to unload assets, the source said.

Initially, Petrobras, as the company is known, had set the delivery date for non-binding proposals to acquire Liquigas Distribudora SA to June 6. But the company decided to postpone the delivery to wait for Brazil’s Supreme Court ruling on the need of congressional approval for the sale of subsidiaries. The judges decided on Thursday that no approval from Congress is needed. Among the investors interested in acquiring Liquigas are private equity firms Advent International Corp., Warburg Pincus and CVC Capital Partners. The first two firms are expected to bid alone for Liquigas, at least in the first round. CVC is in talks with an undisclosed strategic partner to form a consortium. Brazilian investment firm Itausa Investimentos Itau SA is in talks with LPG distribution company Copagaz on a potential joint bid, two sources said. Copagaz has already discussed partnerships with other funds but talks did not evolve, the sources added. Other financial firms expected to bid are sovereign wealth fund Mubadala Investment Co, which was outbid by France’s Engie SA in the process to buy pipeline network company TAG from Petrobras. Turkish firm Aygaz AS, which has joined the Liquigas sale process, is also expected to deliver a bid. Ultrapar, which had signed an agreement to buy Liquigas in 2017 but was barred by Brazilian antitrust watchdog Cade, was considering a bid in a consortium, but it was not clear if it would make one. Petrobras restricted the bidders in April to avoid a second blocking of the deal by Cade.

-7.02210279261479," Petrobras, Brazil government dodge bullet as Supreme Court approves asset sales BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil’s Supreme Court ruled on Thursday that state-run firms do not need congressional approval to sell their subsidiaries, a major victory for the government of President Jair Bolsonaro and state-run oil firm Petrobras. Also on Thursday, Supreme Court Justice Edson Fachin, who ruled in May to suspend the $8.6 billion sale of Petrobras’ TAG pipeline unit to France’s Engie SA, reversed his decision in light of the full court’s ruling, allowing Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the firm is formally known, to go ahead with the divestment. The decisions will allow Petrobras to proceed with its plan to divest $27 billion of non-core assets by 2023, which it has repeatedly said is key to reducing its bloated debt load. The ruling was also a positive for other state-run firms such as power company Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA, or Eletrobras, which is also eyeing divestments. Plans to privatize state firms are central to Bolsonaro’s economic proposals as he aims to kick-start the country’s flagging economy. Paulo Guedes, the economy minister, has said the government could raise some 1 trillion reais ($258 billion) through privatizations. Mines and Energy Minister Bento Albuquerque cheered the decision. “It was very important for the investments we will have in the oil and gas sector and in the electricity sector,” he said in a statement. “In addition, it brings predictability and legal security to the market.” In a surprise ruling last month, Fachin suspended the TAG sale after a lawsuit by a union, arguing that divestments of subsidiaries by state-run firms required congressional approval. That requirement could have effectively brought such sales to a crawl. His decision was based on a separate 2018 decision by another justice. The case raised questions about the clarity of Brazil’s judicial framework. Brazil’s slightly lower Supreme Judicial Court and the nation’s solicitor general had approved the sale before the May ruling. Brazil’s antitrust regulator had signed off on the deal as well. By the time the deal was suspended, Engie had already raised $3 billion for the acquisition."

In June 2018, Supreme Court Minister Ricardo Lewandowski issued a preliminary opinion saying the “sale of shares in public companies, of mixed capital firms and of subsidiaries requires previous legislative authorization.” However, key asset sales later got the go-ahead from Brazil’s slightly lower Supreme Judicial Court, or STJ, and from Brazil’s solicitor-general. Last month, another Supreme Court (STF) minister, Edson Fachin, issued a decision upholding Lewandowski’s opinion, calling the STJ decision contradictory. That decision was issued in response to a lawsuit brought by a union, irked by Petrobras’ TAG gas pipeline unit, which it agreed to sell to France’s Engie SA in April for $8.6 billion. The eventual decision, due later on Wednesday, will have repercussions on the TAG sale, but also on Petrobras’ upcoming divestments, which are likely to be affected given their similarities to the TAG sale. Since last week, Petrobras representatives and the government of far-right President Jair Bolsonaro have engaged in a full court press with STF ministers in the hope of getting a favorable court decision. Two Petrobras sources involved in the case told Reuters they thought those efforts would pay off. A loss would be a significant setback to the Bolsonaro administration, which has pledged to trim back the role of government-run firms through a privatization program. It would also be a major blow to Petrobras, which is seeking to use asset sales to trim net debt of 372.2 billion reais ($96.32 billion). The company did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

-3.8749165199766837," UPDATE 1-Brazil court ruling affecting Petrobras sales pushed to Thursday (Adds context and detail on STF ruling) BRASILIA, June 5 (Reuters) - Brazil’s Supreme Court on Wednesday postponed a decision on whether asset sales by state companies require authorization by Congress, pushing to Thursday a ruling with major implications for the divestment plans of state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA, or Petrobras. Four justices had cast votes on the matter before the suspension, with two ruling that congressional approval was not required and two ruling that it was required. The two who decided in favor of divestments passing through Congress had previously ruled in a similar fashion, and their Wednesday decisions had been widely expected. Reuters reported earlier on Wednesday that Petrobras expects the Supreme Court to narrowly allow it to proceed with asset sales. In June 2018, Supreme Court Minister Ricardo Lewandowski issued a preliminary opinion saying the “sale of shares in public companies, of mixed capital firms and of subsidiaries requires previous legislative authorization.” However, key asset sales later got the go-ahead from Brazil’s slightly lower Supreme Judicial Court, or STJ, and from Brazil’s solicitor-general. Last month, another Supreme Court (STF) minister, Edson Fachin, issued a decision upholding Lewandowski’s opinion, calling the STJ decision contradictory. That decision was issued in response to a lawsuit brought by a union, irked by Petrobras’ TAG gas pipeline unit, which it agreed to sell to France’s Engie SA in April for $8.6 billion.

-6.098395926511295," Brazil regulator approves sale of Petrobras oilfields to PetroReconcavo RIO DE JANEIRO, May 31 (Reuters) - Brazilian antitrust regulator Cade has approved the purchase by independent oil firm PetroReconcavo of 34 oilfields owned by Petroleo Brasileiro SA , the government’s official bulletin showed on Friday. Cade said the sale did not reduce competition and “could be seen as a de-concentration of the market,” given that Petrobras, as the state-run oil firm is commonly known, has a “dominant position both in the gas and in the oil sector in Brazil.” In April, Petrobras announced the sale of the 34 onshore oilfields located in the northeastern state of Rio Grande do Norte to PetroReconcavo for roughly $384 million."

In recent days, lawyers for Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as well as Brazil’s Ministry of Mines and Energy and the federal solicitor-general’s office, known as the AGU, have been lobbying the top court to overturn injunctions suspending divestitures by Petrobras, according to several sources with knowledge of the matter. Brazil’s Supreme Court, the STF, was initially scheduled to rule at 2 p.m. Brasilia time (1700 GMT) on whether the sale of state-run companies and their subsidiaries needs the approval of Congress and whether they need to be sold in an auction format. However, at the beginning of the hearing, STF President Dias Toffoli delayed a ruling until Wednesday next week, saying the court would dedicate the Thursday session to testimony from interested parties. Brazil-listed preferred shares in Petrobras turned negative after the STF delayed its decision, and were down 0.5% in afternoon trade. The hearing follows a decision by a single justice on Tuesday to suspend the $8.6 billion sale of Petrobras’ TAG pipeline unit to France’s Engie SA, and stems ultimately from a similar decision made by a different judge last year. A ruling upholding the injunctions would be a blow to Petrobras, which is counting on asset sales to reduce its hefty net debt load of roughly 372 billion reais ($93 billion). Among the asset divestitures that would likely be affected by the ruling is the sale of eight refineries that the company has said could fetch some $15 billion. Privatizations are also a major pillar of President Jair Bolsonaro’s economic program. His economy minister, Paulo Guedes, has said privatizations could bring 1 trillion reais into public coffers.

In a securities filing, Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as the company is formally known, said the U.S. regulator requested information on trading activities that are currently the target of “Operation Car Wash,” an investigation by Brazilian prosecutors that has uncovered billions of dollars in bribes. In December, prosecutors said employees in Petrobras’ oil trading division accepted tens of millions of dollars in kickbacks from 2011 to 2014 from intermediaries connected to the world’s largest commodities traders, including Vitol SA , Glencore Plc and Trafigura AG. The U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation has joined the probe, and an employee at Petrobras’ Houston office, who was fired when an indictment came to light, is now cooperating with prosecutors in New York, according to documents. “Petrobras ... was contacted by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) with information requests regarding certain trading activities that are the target of Operation Car Wash,” the company said on Thursday. Glencore and Trafigura have declined to comment on the investigation. Vitol has said it has a “zero tolerance” policy with respect to bribery and corruption and that it is cooperating with authorities. The CFTC disclosure comes amid a rocky week for Petrobras. On Tuesday, a Brazilian Supreme Court justice suspended the $8.6 billion sale of a pipeline network to Engie SA in a decision that could jeopardize tens of billions of dollars in additional sales by the indebted Petrobras. On Thursday, another court suspended the sale of a fertilizer unit. (Reporting by Gram Slattery; Additional reporting by Luciano Costa in Sao Paulo; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Jeffrey Benkoe)"

A consortium led by the subsidiary of French gas and power group Engie had already closed the purchase of Transportadora Associada de Gás, or TAG, from state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA in April and received approval from Brazil’s antitrust regulator for the deal. Engie told the court its decision had “created a situation of extreme juridical insecurity” because it had already begun an operation involving “significantly” costly financial resources to buy a 90% stake in TAG. Supreme Court judge Edson Fachin issued an injunction on Friday suspending some major divestments by Petrobras at the request of an oil workers union. The full court will debate the injunction on Thursday. Under the deal agreed with Petrobras, the oil company would retain a 10% stake in TAG, which operates 4,500 kilometers (2,800 miles) of gas pipelines. Engie and its subsidiary will control 58.5% and Quebec pension fund CDPQ will hold 31.5%."

Petrobras, as the company is widely known, has leased storage tanks in the port city of Qingdao, which will allow it to sell smaller quantities of crude promptly to the local market, the company told Reuters in an email. It said initial shipments of Lula and Buzios crude were set to arrive in China at the end of June and beginning of July. The company has been “intensively” working to gain share among China’s independent refiners, known as teapots, it said. Earlier on Tuesday, Reuters reported that Petrobras had chartered the very large crude carrier (VLCC) Maran Cleo here, which is scheduled to arrive at Qingdao on June 24. The VLCC contains 2 million barrels of Lula crude, part of which has been sold while the rest will go into storage, Reuters reported. The producer has another VLCC that will arrive between July 10 and 15 at Qingdao that contains about 1 million barrels of Buzios crude for storage. Buzios is a new medium-sweet grade that was first exported late last year."
-8.65921342778008," Brazil's top court set to decide on Petrobras divestments Thursday BRASILIA/RIO DE JANEIRO, May 28 (Reuters) - Brazil’s Supreme Court is set to issue on Thursday a key decision that could hold up billions of dollars of divestments by oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA and other state-run firms. Dias Toffoli, the president of the Supreme Court, known as the STF, has included in the court’s Thursday agenda a discussion of whether some privatizations by state-run firms need congressional approval and need to be carried out via an auction. If the court decides that those requirements must be met, it could throw into flux major planned sales by Petrobras, as the company is widely known, such as the sale of eight refineries, which it said could fetch some $15 billion, and the sale of its Araucaria Nitrogenos fertilizer unit. It would also hold up the sale of Petrobras’ TAG gas pipeline unit, which it agreed to sell to France’s Engie SA in April for $8.6 billion. In June 2018, Supreme Court Minister Ricardo Lewandowski issued a preliminary opinion saying the “sale of shares in public companies, of mixed capital firms and of subsidiaries requires previous legislative authorization.” However, key asset sales later got the go-ahead from Brazil’s slightly lower Supreme Judicial Court, or STJ, and from Brazil’s solicitor-general. On Monday, another STF minister, Edson Fachin, issued a decision upholding Lewandowski’s decision, calling the STJ decision contradictory. The decision, issued in response to a lawsuit brought by a union, concerns the TAG pipeline sale, but Petrobras’ upcoming divestments are also likely to be affected given their similarities to the TAG sale. Fachin’s decision led Toffoli, the court president, to schedule the Thursday hearing. Petrobras said in a statement that it was studying the Monday decision and would take actions to defend its interests. The firm stressed the importance of divestments in reducing its indebtedness."
-8.65921342778008," Brazil's Petrobras nears sale of offshore oilfields: sources RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil’s Petroleo Brasileiro SA is nearing the sale of two oilfields in a process that could fetch around $1 billion and aid the state-run oil firm in its bid to reduce debt. Petrobras, as the company is known, has set a June 5 deadline to receive final binding offers for its Pampo and Enchova oilfields off the coast of Rio de Janeiro, said two sources with knowledge of the matter, who requested anonymity to discuss confidential matters. Trident Energy, an independent oil company backed by private equity firm Warburg Pincus, is in the pole position, though Petrobras has invited other firms to submit a final bid, including Rio de Janeiro-based Petro Rio SA and a consortium of EIG Global Energy Partners and local independent Ouro Preto Oleo e Gas, the sources said. Petro Rio declined to comment. Petrobras, EIG and Trident did not respond to a request for comment. Together, Pampo and Enchova produced almost 39,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, according to July 2018 figures, making it the largest mature production asset in the company’s divestment portfolio. Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco, who took the reins in January, is overseeing the sale of dozens of assets in a bid to reduce debt and refocus the firm on deepwater exploration and production. In April, Petrobras announced the $8.6 billion sale of its TAG pipeline unit to Engie SA and detailed plans to sell eight refineries in a process it said could fetch some $15 billion. On Monday, the firm launched the sale process for 27 onshore oilfields in the coastal state of Rio de Janeiro. The Pampo and Enchova oilfields have been among the more challenging sales for Petrobras. In 2018, Petrobras entered into exclusive talks with the EIG consortium. However, under rules set by Brazil’s federal audit court, Petrobras must carry out a final rebidding process after concluding bilateral negotiations, allowing third parties to submit new bids at any value as long as they have the same contractual terms as the bilateral offer. EIG took advantage of the rebidding round to reduce its offer, which caused Petrobras to walk away from the table, Reuters reported in January. Petrobras then entered into exclusive talks with the Trident group. The June deadline represents the second attempt at a final rebid. The sources warned that a short delay is possible, but not expected. The new contract has a so-called earn-out provision, in which the buyer could be required to pay up to $200 million more to Petrobras after the initial purchase, depending on crude prices, the sources said."
-9.776531289429116," Brazil Supreme Court minister holds up sale of Petrobras units BRASILIA (Reuters) - A Brazilian Supreme Court judge has issued an injunction suspending some major divestments by Petroleo Brasileiro SA, according to a document seen by Reuters on Monday, possibly creating a major headache for the state-run oil firm. The decision, issued on Friday by Justice Edson Fachin, calls for the suspension of the sale of Petrobras’ TAG pipeline unit and eight of the companies’ refineries, as well as the sale of its Araucaria Nitrogenos fertilizer unit. It was not immediately clear how the ruling would work given that Petrobras already sold TAG to Engie SA in April and received approval from Brazil’s antitrust regulator for the deal. The TAG pipeline unit sold for $8.6 billion and the firm has said the refineries could fetch some $15 billion, making these asset sales key for the firm’s deleveraging plans. Petrobras said in a statement on Monday it will study the decision and take action to defend its interests and those of its investors. It stressed the importance of its divestment plans to reduce its indebtedness. Engie did not reply immediately to a request for comment. Petrobras divestments, along with many other contentious economic issues in Brazil, have often been subject to contradictory decisions by high-ranking judicial authorities in recent years. The TAG divestment, for instance, had previously been given the go-ahead by Brazil’s second highest court, the Supreme Judicial Court, and by the nation’s solicitor-general. Justice Fachin argued that the earlier decision contradicted a previous ruling by Supreme Court judge Ricardo Lewandowski. Coming in response to a lawsuit brought by a union against the planned divestment of Petrobras refineries, the ruling said the sale of such assets must be carried out in an auction format and require Congressional approval. The oil workers union, Sindipetro Unificado-SP, welcomed the decision as “a new victory” in its efforts to stop the privatization of Petrobras. Brazil-listed preferred shares in Petrobras were little changed on Monday, closing 0.57 up, underperforming the benchmark Bovespa index, which was up 1.32 percent."

-4.360061072403917," Brazil's Petrobras expresses interest in two areas in 'TOR' auction SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Petroleo Brasileiro said on Tuesday it is interested in exercising its preferential right to tender in two areas in an auction of excess oil from the so-called “transfer of rights” (TOR) area, according to a company filing. The Brazilian state-run company said it was interested in the Buzios and Itapu areas, based on a 30% stake with a chance to increase the holding on the day of the auction, which is expected in October. The auction could result in a signing bonus of nearly 21 billion reais ($5.20 billion), it said. Petrobras, as the company is known, said that it could participate in auctions in two other areas, but on the same terms available to other potential bidders. The news of Petrobras’ desire to enter the auction brings clarity to a long-awaited auction that is likely to lure some of the world’s top energy firms and which the government says could generate some 100 billion reais ($26 billion). Petrobras has settled a long-running dispute about the TOR area, a roughly 2,800-square-km (1,080-square-mile) zone off the coast of southeastern Brazil where billions of barrels of oil are trapped beneath a layer of salt under the ocean floor. Under the terms of the settlement, Brazil’s government will pay Petrobras $9.058 billion, paving the way for the auction, which grants access to prized assets in an oil-producing zone known as the pre-salt. The area has emerged as one of the world’s most promising conventional oil plays. Petrobras and the government are still discussing how the auction winners will potentially partner with the state oil company, which is already producing at Buzios and has the right of first refusal to remain operator at the four fields. Regardless of the final arrangement, winners of the auction will be required to compensate Petrobras for the infrastructure and exploratory work in which the company has already invested. Among the companies with exploration and production assets adjacent or relatively close to the TOR area, offering potential cost savings, are Total SA, Royal Dutch Shell PLC, and China’s CNOOC Ltd and CNPC."

In a call with analysts following the release of first-quarter results, Petrobras Exploration and Production Director Carlos Alberto de Oliveira reaffirmed the company’s production goal of 2.8 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) for 2019, adding that the company has been exceeding that figure in May. First quarter production, 2.538 million boepd, was held back by a number of stoppages. Talking to reporters later in the day, Petrobras Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco credited rising production for lifting the company’s share price on Wednesday, saying twice that investors liked the firm’s quarterly figures more than the press did. On Tuesday night, Petrobras reported a 42 percent drop in first quarter net profit, missing Refinitiv estimates. Analysts at BTG Pactual led by Thiago Duarte called the results “uninspiring,” noting in particular a 38 percent increase in net debt because of the adoption of new accounting standards. Brazil-listed preferred shares of Petrobras were up 3.5 percent in afternoon trade, topping a 1.5 percent rise in Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa index. Executives at Petrobras also pledged on Wednesday to keep forging ahead with an ambitious divestment program. Castello Branco said the company would look to divest its remaining 10 percent stakes in TAG and NTS, two natural gas pipeline units recently sold to investors, as soon as it closes the sale of 90 percent of TAG. The company in June will also offer first details to investors on the sale of eight refineries that could fetch some $15 billion, according to Anelise Lara, the head of downstream operations. Castello Branco told reporters fuel distribution unit Petrobras Distribuidora SA, which is being privatized, would not be a potential purchaser of the refineries, contradicting comments on Tuesday by that unit’s CEO. He also challenged a March statement by Israel’s energy minister that Petrobras would take part in a gas tender there, remarks that spooked analysts, who saw the comments as proof of political interference at the company, as Brazil’s current government is a staunch Israeli ally. Petrobras paid for the rights to examine opportunities in Israel and in Guyana to gather market intelligence, Castello Branco said, but has no intention of making new investments outside Brazil."

As in previous quarters, results were clouded by judicial contingencies and other one-off items that have become commonplace at the company, which in recent years has been at the center of one of the world’s largest-ever corruption probes. When adjusted for those one-off items - including 1.3 billion reais in judicial contingencies due to an ongoing dispute with a bankrupt rig lessor - Petrobras said it would have reported a quarterly profit of 5.1 billion reais. Quarterly oil production at Petrobras fell 4 percent from the previous quarter, a figure that was previously reported in part by Brazil’s oil regulator. Petrobras attributed the decline in part to a series of stoppages. The firm said that its April oil production grew to 2.61 million barrels per day (bpd), and the firm’s P-74 oil platform completed its ramp-up period on May 2, reaching 150,000 bpd. “The expectation is that oil production will increase in the second quarter as new complexes advance in the ramp-up process,” Petrobras wrote. In comments accompanying the results, Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco continued to emphasize the firm’s focus on asset sales, which has emerged as the key focus of his mandate. He also emphasized a number of cost-saving measures at the firm, including the shuttering of several international offices and the gutting of the company’s Houston office, which was at the center of a major corruption scandal in December. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization adjusted for certain one-off items, known as adjusted EBITDA, came to 27.5 billion reais in the quarter, though the firm said that figure would have been 25.2 billion reais if not for an adjustment in Petrobras’ accounting practices. Both figures missed the Refinitiv estimate of 28.9 billion reais. Net debt increased some 38 percent in the quarter, though Petrobras said debt would have in fact fallen marginally if not for the adjustments to its accounting methods."
-3.184839542424309," Petrobras distributor looks at buying parent's refineries: CEO RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Petrobras Distribuidora SA, the fuel distribution unit of Brazilian state-run oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro SA, will study a possible purchase of refineries being sold by its parent company, an executive said on Tuesday. Petrobras, as the oil firm is widely known, announced in April a plan to sell eight refineries in a move it said could fetch some $15 billion. Also in April, the firm confirmed plans to dilute its stake in Petrobras Distribuidora via a follow-on offering in a process that is expected to privatize the unit. The newly privatized unit will then examine a purchase of the refineries, Petrobras Distribuidora Chief Executive Rafael Grisolia said on a call with analysts following first quarter results on Tuesday. “It’s clear that, as a distributor, we have to look at this from various angles,” Grisolia said. Among the other possible buyers of the refineries, analysts say, are competing fuel distribution firms such as Raizen and Ipiranga, a unit of Ultrapar Participacoes SA. Trading firms with operations in Brazil’s downstream segment, such as Glencore PLC and Vitol SA, are also seen as candidates, as well as international oil companies with production activities in Brazil. Brazil-listed shares in Petrobras Distribuidora were up 2.8 percent in afternoon trade after the firm posted a 93 percent rise in first-quarter net income on Monday night."
-3.184839542424309," Petrobras plan to end refining monopoly in Brazil comes with caveats RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil’s Petroleo Brasileiro SA drew plaudits from investors last month for announcing a plan to sell off eight of its refineries in a process the company says could fetch some $15 billion. But analysts and industry experts say that while the divestments will help Petrobras shore up its finances, it may fail to create a competitive refining market in Brazil, an oft-stated goal of regulators and Petrobras executives. That’s because the company is hanging onto its refineries in the states of Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, home to over 60 million Brazilians. They collectively process about 1.1 million barrels of oil per day, according to Brazil’s oil regulator, about half of the company’s total capacity. “I think it’s a little bit for show to make it seem like the refining market is being opened up,” said Alberto Barriga, a former refining executive at Petrobras and a partner at consultancy Bizup. “But it won’t make any difference in terms of competition as the distance between refineries is large and transport will be too expensive (to move fuel between regions).” In response to questions from Reuters, Petrobras said its refineries in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro will be subject to competition from fuel imports and cabotage, or the transport of fuel from other refineries within Brazil. It added that four of the five refineries it will retain are integrated by pipelines and other infrastructure, making the sale of individual assets difficult. In addition, the facilities’ proximity to Brazil’s prolific Campos and Santos offshore oil basins supports its view that they are strategic, Petrobras added. Truckers protesting high diesel prices last year led Brazil’s government, under former President Michel Temer, to demand that Petrobras cut fuel prices, a move that hit the company’s shares and triggered the chief executive’s departure. That intervention and a more recent one by new President Jair Bolsonaro underline how politics often impinge on the Brazilian energy sector. Some analysts have said breaking up Petrobras’ monopoly on refining could help lower prices at the pump by boosting competition and lessen the firm’s exposure to meddling from Brasilia. But the prospect of political interference could dampen investor interest in the refineries. Petrobras’ plan to retain the refineries in the country’s economic sweet spot could also run afoul of antitrust regulator Cade, which in December opened an inquiry into Brazil’s refining market. “Whatever model Petrobras ends up using is going to have to pass through Cade. Does it stimulate competition? Or does it generate regional monopolies?” said Adriano Pires, a consultant for Brazil’s Center for Infrastructure. “It could be that Cade makes them sell something (in Rio or Sao Paulo).” Among the natural buyers for the refineries are national fuel distribution firms such as Raizen and Ipiranga, the fuel distribution unit of Ultrapar Participacoes SA, as well as trading firms that have established a presence in Brazil such as Glencore PLC and Vitol SA, analysts say. Petrobras distribution unit Petrobras Distribuidora SA is also seen as a potential candidate after its planned privatization. But for a successful sale, the government will have to prove its free-market credentials. “The government has to decide if it believes in the market or not,” said Edmar de Almeida, a professor and researcher and the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro."

-0.038170889759151186," Quarterly Petrobras oil production falls amid platform stoppages SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Oil production by Petroleo Brasileiro SA fell 3.5 percent in the first quarter from the same period a year before, according to Brazil’s oil regulator ANP, which attributed the fall to a number of scheduled and unscheduled stoppages. In a statement, the regulator said the production declines were due to maintenance work and other interruptions in January and February at platforms and FPSO units owned by Petrobras, as the firm is known. The fall in production, to roughly 2.4 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d), comes even as Petrobras initiated operations at three platforms in March in Brazil’s offshore, pre-salt oil area, considered the nation’s most prolific oil producing zone. Production at Petrobras has been hit by a decline in investments in the firm’s more traditional onshore and ‘post-salt’ offshore assets. The company is also divesting many of its legacy oilfields, but relatively few of those sales have so far closed. In Brazil as a whole, oil production rose 0.96 percent in annual terms to 3.261 million boe/d in March, the ANP said. While Petrobras has historically divulged monthly production statistics, it has not done so since January. On Thursday evening, the firm informed Reuters it would shift to quarterly reporting of oil production. The company is due to report its first quarter financial results on May 7."
0.6322643447980373," Apollo-backed Starboard in exclusive talks with Petrobras for 9 oilfields -sources RIO DE JANEIRO/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Apollo Global Management-backed investment firm Starboard Restructuring Partners is in exclusive talks with Petrobras to buy nine onshore oilfields for roughly 1 billion reais ($252 million), two sources familiar with the matter said this week. The Brazilian investment firm, in which Apollo has a 20% stake, has partnered with oil startup 3R Petroleum, aiming to bring Starboard, for which this would be its entry into oil production, more knowledge about the sector. 3R was founded in part by former Petrobras managers and has been active in the industry only recently. The move comes as Petroleo Brasileiro SA, as Brazil’s state-run oil firm is formally known, seeks to unload stakes in mature oilfields in a bid to reduce debt and focus on the nation’s offshore, ‘pre-salt’ play. Last week, the company announced the $384 million sale of a complex of 34 relatively small oilfields known collectively as Riacho da Forquilha to PetroReconcavo, a Salvador, Brazil-based firm. Current Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco has made a priority of exiting the onshore segment, where production has fallen dramatically in recent years, amid flagging investments by the firm. Petrobras and Starboard declined to comment. Ricardo Savini, a partner at 3R, did not respond to a request for comment. One of the sources said Starboard is in talks with Petrobras to acquire the Macau and Fazenda Belem clusters, which are composed of seven and two oilfields, respectively. Combined, those assets produce about 5,000 barrels per day (bpd) of oil, according to the document seen by Reuters. A deal would represent a second chance of sorts for 3R. Petrobras announced in November that it had reached a deal with the startup to sell Riacho da Forquilha, which aroused suspicions from unions and trade groups concerned about the deal’s lack of a clear financing structure. Eventually, the deal was rescinded after 3R failed to acquire financing, and PetroReconcavo agreed to purchase the fields. Starboard manages 2.5 billion reais, while its partner Apollo has more than $300 billion under management. (This story Starboard corrects Apollo stake to 20 percent, not 30 percent, in paragraph 2)."

The sale was agreed to in January, but Chevron put the transfer of the 112,229-barrel-per-day plant’s ownership on hold on April 2, telling Petrobras it had to prove the refinery would operate as promised, sources told Reuters. The Pasadena refinery is the second on the U.S. Gulf Coast for Chevron, which is based in San Ramon, California. Chevron wanted the refinery to process sweet crude coming from its oil fields in the Permian Basin of Texas. “This acquisition builds on the strength of our existing Gulf Coast business, enabling us to supply more of our retail market in the region with Chevron-produced products, and positions us for connectivity to our strong upstream assets in the Permian Basin,” said Mark Nelson, Chevron’s executive vice president for downstream and chemicals. In addition to the refinery, Chevron acquired PRSI, a Petrobras subsidiary that operates the refinery and owns subsidiary PRSI Trading, which trades in crude and refined products markets. PRSI owns a 5.1-million-barrel storage tank farm and an additional 143 acres (58 hectares) of land along the Houston Ship Channel. Chevron also operates a 352,000-bpd refinery in Pascagoula, Mississippi. The Pasadena refinery was at the center of several investigations in Brazil of corruption within Petrobras. The Brazilian oil company paid $360 million for half of the Pasadena refinery in 2006, more than eight times what its previous owner, Astra Oil, a unit of Belgian-controlled Astra Transcor Energy, paid for the complex a year earlier. By 2012, Petrobras had sunk $1.18 billion into it, including the cost of buying out Astra’s remaining half after a legal dispute with Astra."

Petrobras, or Petroleo Brasileiro SA, said its board had approved a plan to sell eight refineries in Brazil, including its large, recently built Abreu e Lima unit, according to a securities filing. The company also said it will sell a gas station chain in Uruguay, called PUDSA, and an additional stake in Brazil’s No. 1 fuel distribution company BR Distribuidora SA as part of a massive divestment drive that aims to cut debt and raise money to be invested in its core oil exploration area. Petrobras, which currently has a 71 percent stake in BR Distribuidora, said it is evaluating a secondary share offering to reduce its stake in that business. A source with direct knowledge of the decisions taken by the board told Reuters earlier on Friday that the oil company could reduce its stake in BR to as low as 40 percent. Petrobras said that among the other refining assets to be put up for sale are its Gabriel Passos unit, located in central Minas Gerais state, the Getúlio Vargas refinery, in southern Paraná state and the Landulpho Alves unit, in northern Bahia state, one of the largest refineries in the country with capacity to process 323,000 barrels per day. The Abreu e Lima unit is emblematic. Launched in 2005 as a joint project for Brazil and Venezuela, in a collaboration of the leftist governments of Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva and Hugo Chavez, the unit had successive cost overruns that led to total capital expenditure of around $20 billion from an initial estimate of $2.3 billion.

The deal related to the Tartaruga Verde field and Module 3 of the Espadarte field. The deal is part of Petrobras’ divestment program, which seeks to reduce indebtedness. In its statement, the company also announced it had nearly completed the full sale of its TAG pipeline unit to France’s Engie for $8.6 billion. “Continuous portfolio management contributes to improving the allocation of capital, thereby increasing the generation of value for our shareholders, in addition to enabling the reduction of indebtedness and cost of the company’s capital,” the company’s chief executive, Roberto Castello Branco, said in a statement. Petrobras said that the total amount of asset divestments so far this year already amounts to $11.3 billion. Petrobras said the value of the transaction with Petronas will be paid in two installments: $258.7 million on Thursday and $1.03 billion at the close of the transaction. Petrobras will maintain a 50 percent stake and the operation of the fields, while Petronas will get a bigger toehold in oil production in Brazil, where it already operates in the lubricants segment. The Tartaruga Verde field began operations on June 22 and currently produces about 103,000 barrels per day of oil and 1.2 million cubic meters per day of gas. Module 3 is an area of the Espadarte field to be developed in an integrated way with the Tartaruga Verde and is expected to begin producing oil in 2021.

In a securities filing, Petrobras, as the firm is known, said the provision was based on the “current stage of litigation” with Sete Brasil Participacoes SA. Petrobras is due to report its first-quarter results May 7. Founded in 2008 to fill the world’s biggest deep-water drilling fleet order, Sete Brasil had to file for bankruptcy in 2016, sagging under 18 billion reais of debt, after efforts to secure a long-term contract with Petrobras failed. That set off a years-long legal dispute that has shown signs of coming to an end only recently. In March, Petrobras said it would continue to lease four rigs from Sete Brasil and terminate 28 other contracts as part of a possible settlement. Petrobras, which is still wading through a years-long corruption probe known as Car Wash, often includes significant one-time provisions in its quarterly results.

2.282000059303289," Brazil's Petrobras revisits whistleblowers in wake of trading scandal RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil’s Petroleo Brasileiro SA is re-examining its treatment of whistleblower complaints after the indictment of six of the state-run oil firm’s traders in December indicated that efforts to root out corruption had faltered, according to three people familiar with the matter. In recent weeks, officials at Petrobras, as the firm is known, have summoned a number of current and former employees who had flagged instances of corruption at the company, particularly in relation to its trading operations, the sources said. Company officials questioned the employees on how their complaints had been handled, said the people, who requested anonymity to discuss internal matters. Some of the employees said they were unsatisfied with the company’s response and believed the wrongdoing was not addressed, sources said. In a statement, Petrobras said it was not investigating its controls but rather carrying out a thorough internal probe relating to the December oil trading indictments, with some 27 professionals looking into the matter. The firm said it could not go into detail regarding the internal probe, citing the need to protect employees and the integrity of the investigation. The enquiry underlines how Petrobras is still working to improve compliance and root out the graft at the center of Brazil’s five-year “Car Wash” investigation, considered by U.S. law enforcement to be the largest corporate corruption case ever. The scandal has spread across Latin America, toppling governments, destroying business empires and leading Peru’s former president Alan Garcia to kill himself last week to avoid arrest in a related investigation. Petrobras has said that a robust compliance department and beefed up internal investigations team have helped it to correct course since the Car Wash probes came to light in 2014 with revelations about political bribes paid by contracting firms. However, in December, Brazilian prosecutors blew the lid off another kickback scheme, this time in the oil trading division of Petrobras, which also implicated commodities trading giants Glencore PLC, Vitol SA and Trafigura AG. In March, Reuters reported that Petrobras officials had known of problems in its oil trading operations for years, although the company failed to quickly identify suspects and sideline them from operations. Of the six people indicted in December, one pled guilty to conspiracy to commit money laundering and is cooperating with U.S. authorities in a parallel investigation of the scheme, Reuters reported in February. Those indictments were focused on the company’s Houston trading desk. Some of the employees interviewed by Petrobras in recent weeks had previously complained of irregularities at the Singapore desk, the sources said, raising the possibility that the probe could expand geographically. Petrobras did not comment on those allegations. According to documents sent to Brazilian federal police investigators and seen by Reuters, a Singaporean employee complained to Petrobras officials in December 2012 of irregular trading of bunker fuel, which is used by ships. A subsequent internal investigation found that Petrobras had paid unusual premiums for a significant quantity of bunker fuel in 2012, according to the documents, which were dated late 2012 and early 2013. Internal investigators recommended a series of measures to improve transparency at the Singaporean trading unit. It is unclear if those measures were carried out. The federal police did not respond to a request for comment."

In recent days, government officials and Petrobras executives have sought to reassure investors that the company is completely free of government interference after Petrobras canceled a diesel price hike on Friday at the behest of the government. High-ranking officials have typically opposed privatization, though not without qualifications. In November, Petrobras Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco said that privatizing the company was not part of his mandate, while in October, the chief of Bolsonaro’s party told Reuters that privatization was not on the short-term agenda.

3.6399194831620894," Petrobras hikes diesel price, eyes divestments amid investor unease RIO DE JANEIRO/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian state-run oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro SA hiked diesel prices on Wednesday, and executives said the firm could expand its already aggressive divestment plan while arguing the company was completely free of political interference. In an impromptu news conference at the Rio de Janeiro headquarters of Petrobras, as the company is known, Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco announced a diesel price hike of 10 cents per liter and said Petrobras has complete control over its pricing strategy. Speaking only minutes before at an event in Sao Paulo, Chief Financial Officer Rafael Grisolia said Petrobras was looking at selling off assets such as deepwater pipelines and Petrobras Distribuidora SA, which includes a gas station chain stretching across the country. The comments come as executives scramble to contain the fallout from the company’s cancellation on Friday of a diesel price hike at the behest of Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, stirring fears of political interference and tanking Petrobras shares. While Bolsonaro´s government has promised a hands-off approach to Petrobras, investors are wary of a return to policies enacted under past administrations, in which the company was forced to sell fuel at a discount to international rates. On Tuesday, Bolsonaro´s spokesman and Economy Minister Paulo Guedes sought to characterize the canceled price hike as a one-time error that would not be repeated. According to an information posted on Petrobras’ website, the company increased the price of diesel at refineries by 4.7 percent after canceling a 5.7 percent increase on Friday. Castello Branco said Petrobras “rigorously” keeps its prices in line with international rates and has no plans to change its policy of adjusting fuel prices every 15 days. Petrobras is analyzing the best model for selling three offshore natural gas pipelines, Grisolia said, including whether they will be sold individually or in a package. Grisolia said the company would “probably” reduce its stake in Petrobras Distribuidora to below 50 percent from the current 71 percent, effectively privatizing the unit through a secondary share offering. Investors have cheered Petrobras’ recent push to cut debt and refocus on oil exploration and production via an aggressive divestment program.

The offering will be led by the investment banking units of JPMorgan Chase & Co and Citigroup Inc, along with the investment banks owned by Itau Unibanco Holding SA, Banco Bradesco SA, Bank of America Corp , Credit Suisse Group AG, Banco do Brasil SA, Banco Santander Brasil SA and HSBC Holdings Plc. BR Distribuidora, as the company is known, is among the assets that Petrobras intends sell to reduce its debt and increase investments in oil exploration. Chief Executive Officer Roberto Castello Branco took the helm of the company in January with an ambitious divestment program. Petrobras, Citi, JPMorgan, BB, BofA and HSBC did not immediately comment. Bradesco, Itau, CS and Santander declined to comment. Petrobras has not decided yet if the offering will mean a privatization of BR Distribuidora, added the sources, who spoke on Monday and Tuesday. They asked for anonymity because the talks were private. If Petrobras decides to sell 22 percent or more of the company, the share offering will effectively privatize the fuel distribution unit. A sale of a 20 percent stake would be worth around 5.3 billion reais ($1.3 billion), based on market prices as of Tuesday afternoon. The company’s market capitalization is 26.7 billion reais. But the company is still discussing if a privatization through a share offering would need to be submitted to Brazil’s audit court, although Castello Branco has said his initial intention is to privatize the fuel distribution arm. Currently, Petrobras holds a 71.25 percent stake in BR Distribuidora. The timing of the offering is still under discussion, but it will likely occur after the sale of a stake owned by state lender Caixa Economica Federal in Petrobras, the sources added. Caixa hired the banks for the offering last week."

Petroleo Brasileiro SA canceled a diesel price hike on Friday as President Jair Bolsonaro called for “fair” prices out of concern for truckers, fueling an 8 percent drop in preferred shares of the debt-laden oil company. Brazilian central bank governor Roberto Campos Neto said it was not his place to comment on the move but said there was no risk of a return to price controls practiced under prior administrations. “In general, obviously liberal economists believe in market prices that are as free as possible, markets with the least intervention possible,” he said, speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the annual spring IMF and World Bank meetings in Washington. “We believe that this in the long run is what brings sustainable growth.” The former senior executive of Banco Santander Brasil SA said uncertainty about the approval of needed reforms in Brazil has limited the flow of foreign investment into the country. Campos Neto said the Brazilian government still lacks a “focal point” to lead the relationship with foreign investors. He praised the bill the government sent to Congress on Thursday related to central bank independence, saying the measure would allow for lower structural interest rates over time.

-3.8310815870517536," Explainer: Brazil's transfer-of-rights oil area - What's next? RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil’s government and state-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA have settled a long-running dispute about one of the world’s most promising offshore oil areas, clearing the way for a blockbuster auction later this year. The national energy council announced on Tuesday that the government would pay Petrobras, as the company is known, $9.058 billion to end their contract dispute regarding the “transfer of rights area” (TOR). The TOR area is a roughly 2,800-square-km (1,080-square-mile) zone off the coast of southeastern Brazil where billions of barrels of oil are trapped beneath a thick layer of salt under the ocean floor. It is part of a larger oil-producing zone known as the pre-salt, which has emerged as one of the world’s most promising conventional oil plays. The TOR was demarcated in a 2010 deal between the government and Petrobras, when the company raised some $70 billion in the world’s largest-ever share offering at the time. In order to maintain control of the company, the government granted Petrobras the rights to extract 5 billion barrels of oil in the TOR area in return for new shares worth 74.8 billion reais, or about $42.5 billion at the time. The government also set aside a “contingency area” of about 1,000 square km (390 square miles) in case the original area proved insufficient. The TOR arrangement provided for Petrobras and the government to revise some terms in the contract when fields were declared commercially viable, taking into account shifts in oil prices, production costs and other variables. Petrobras began declaring TOR fields commercially viable in 2013, starting with the Buzios field, and has been haggling over contract revisions with the government ever since, as oil prices swung sharply and studies showed larger reserves in the area. Brazilian oil regulator ANP now believes there are some 6 billion to 15 billion barrels of oil in the TOR area, in addition to the original 5 billion barrels granted to Petrobras. Brazil’s cash-strapped government has not been able to offer that additional oil at auction because it had not come to terms with Petrobras on the revised TOR contract. Until recent months, the two sides seemed far apart. But since new President Jair Bolsonaro appointed a new Petrobras chief executive in January, talks seem to have picked up pace, culminating in the more than $9 billion agreement. The government has scheduled for Oct. 28 an auction for the rights to extract the excess oil in the TOR area, divided into four separate fields called Atapu, Buzios, Itapu e Sepia. Government officials have said the auction could raise some 100 billion reais ($26 billion) or more. Petrobras and the government are still discussing how the auction winners will potentially partner with the state oil company, which is already producing at Buzios and has the right of first refusal to remain operator at the four fields. Regardless of the final arrangement, winners of the auction will be required to compensate Petrobras for the infrastructure and exploratory work in which the company has already invested. While the exact value of that compensation has not been settled, Reuters reported late last year that the compensation, which is separate from the government’s payment, is likely to be at least 30 billion reais ($7.9 billion). The October auction is expected to attract a range of major global oil companies, which have been discussing the opportunity with government officials in recent months. Not least among the interested parties is Petrobras itself. While the firm is aggressively cutting debt, CEO Castello Branco has said the $9 billion payment from the government would be used to participate in the auction. Among the companies with exploration and production assets adjacent or relatively close to the TOR area, offering potential cost savings, are Total SA, Royal Dutch Shell PLC, and China’s CNOOC Ltd and CNPC. However, they may need to keep an eye out for political interference over the next six months. House Speaker Rodrigo Maia has argued that Congress must approve the accord between the government and Petrobras before the auction can take place. Others, including Finance Minister Paulo Guedes, dispute the need for congressional approval."
-3.8310815870517536," Exclusive: Brazil's Petrobras to sell other gas pipelines in wake of TAG deal's success - sources SAO PAULO (Reuters) - State-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA is preparing to sell three more gas pipelines after successfully selling its larger TAG unit to France’s Engie for $8.6 billion, according to three sources with knowledge of the matter. The group of pipelines, considerably smaller than the TAG unit sold by Petrobras, as the company is known, could be valued at more than $3 billion altogether, one of the sources said. Petrobras has hired the investment banking unit of Credit Suisse AG to sell the pipelines that link oil fields in the so-called pre-salt area in the Santos basin to onshore infrastructure, said the sources, who asked to remain anonymous as the discussions were not yet made public. Petrobras and Credit Suisse declined to comment. Petrobras had initially planned to sell only a minority stake in the units, but after getting a better-than-expected price for the TAG unit, the company may sell control of the pipelines, two of the sources said. A controlling stake would lure more investors than a minority one, one of the sources said. Some of the investors that participated in the TAG deal were interested in the other pipelines, which similarly offer table cash flows. A final decision will be made once Petrobras’ new Chief Financial Officer Andrea Marques de Almeida, who was appointed last month, starts in her new role, one of the sources said. The three units, known as Rota 1, Rota 2 and Rota 3, comprise roughly 1,000 kilometers (621.37 miles) of pipelines stretching from the Santos basin to the coast. Two of those units already transport natural gas generated in sub-salt fields in the Santos basin to onshore facilities in the coast of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo, and the third one is still under construction. The process of selling the additional pipelines will probably not start before the second half of the year, one of the sources said. That’s because Petrobras needs to get the approval of its oil exploration partners in the pre-salt oil fields for the sales since they own stakes in the natural gas production in the fields. Those partners include France’s Total SA, Royal Dutch Shell Plc and China’s CNPC."
-3.8310815870517536," Brazil government to pay Petrobras $9 billion for oil contract revision BRASÍLIA (Reuters) - The Brazilian government reached a landmark deal to pay state-controlled oil company Petróleo Brasileiro SA $9.058 billion for revising a transfer-of-rights oil contract, Energy Minister Bento Albuquerque said on Tuesday. Albuquerque told reporters after a meeting in Brasilia that the agreement opens the way for the government to auction off the excess oil in the transfer-of-rights area, a giant pre-salt oil reserve off the coast of Rio de Janeiro. The payment to Petrobras, as the company is known, is expected to take place on Dec. 13. The company said it was aware of the decision and that it will wait for the official publication of all terms of the deal before making additional comments to the market. The transfer-of-rights contract dates back to a 2010 deal between the government and Petrobras linked to a large share offering made by the company that would have diluted the government’s stake. To maintain control of the oil company, the government sold Petrobras the rights to over 5 billion barrels of oil in a new exploration area for 74.8 billion reais ($19.43 billion). With that money, it bought additional Petrobras shares. The contract foresaw a revision of the deal’s value, considering the fluctuation of the exchange rate and oil prices. The revision has been discussed for months. Brazilian oil regulator ANP estimates there are around 17 billion barrels of recoverable oil in the area, and the government is seeking to auction rights for the exploration of the excess oil. The government expects to raise more money in the auction than it agreed to pay Petrobras. The auction for that extra oil is scheduled for Oct. 28. Companies bidding would have to compensate Petrobras for investments that Petrobras already made in the blocs."

The consortium will acquire a 90% stake in TAG after it made Petrobras an US$8.6bn offer on Friday for the asset, the largest-ever bid for a gas pipeline in Latin America. The Brazilian oil producer will retain the remaining 10% stake and will also use TAG’s natural gas transportation services, Petrobras said in a press release on Friday. Engie and CDPQ are expected to source between US$2.5bn-US$3bn in dollar-denominated debt with three French banks and three Japanese lenders, according to two sources familiar with the transaction. More than 50% of the debt will be raised in Brazilian reais and a portion of the acquisition will be covered by equity, the sources said. Brazilian banks Banco do Brasil, Bradesco and Itaú are providing the local currency debt while Japan’s Mizuho, MUFG and Sumitomo Bank will team with French lenders BNP Paribas, Crédit Agricole and Société Généralé to round out the dollar portion of the debt financing. Santander was financial advisor to Petrobras, the sources added. The debt package will repay TAG’s existing debt and is expected to have a maturity of up to eight to 10 years, one of the sources said. The consortium opted to structure the debt with a longer maturity due to favorable pricing as opposed to a short-term bridge loan that would typically be taken out in the debt capital markets at a later date, the same source added. The consortium expects to cover 70% of the acquisition finance through debt and 30% with equity. Engie said in a separate statement on Monday that the purchase of TAG would increase the French utility’s debt by roughly US$1.8bn. The company said it will also manage the day-to-day operations of the pipeline and after three years, Engie will take on 100% of TAG’s operations and maintenance requirements. The banks, Petrobras and Engie either declined or did not respond to requests for comment on the terms of the financing. Petrobras had been in exclusive talks with Engie and CDPQ over the sale of TAG last year after the pair submitted the highest bid for the asset. The talks, however, stalled in July 2018 after an injunction from Brazil’s Supreme Court. The court required the country’s Congress to approve the sale of any state-owned asset. Brazil’s solicitor general overturned the injunction in January but Petrobras, in line with Brazilian law, had to re-open the bidding process for Engie, CDPQ and any other interested parties. The French and Canadian pair on Friday topped competing offers from consortiums led by Brazilian holdings company Itaúsa Investimentos and a group comprising EIG Global Energy Partners and the United Arab Emirates’ sovereign wealth fund Mubadala, said a third source familiar with the talks. Another party made up of Australian investor Macquarie, Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board had also expressed interest in TAG, sources previously told LPC, a unit of Refinitiv. The offloading of TAG marks Petrobras’ largest individual asset sale to date under the company’s latest divestment plan, unveiled in December 2018, which seeks to raise near US$27bn from asset sales and partnership agreements over the next five years. Petrobras in September 2016 sold a similar gas pipeline, Nova Transportadora do Sudeste, for approximately US$5.2bn to a consortium of investors comprising Canada’s Brookfield Asset Management, British Columbia Investment Management Corp, Singapore’s GIC and the China Investment Corp. The shift away from gas distribution and transportation comes as Petrobras allocates greater investment to the more profitable oil and gas exploration and production segments. The Brazilian oil company is estimated to need almost US$50bn over the next six years for 40 projects, LPC reported in January. (Reporting by Aaron Weinman. Editing by Lynn Adler and Jon Methven)"

Engie said on Monday its successful offer for a 90 percent stake in TAG was made alongside Canada’s state-owned financial and investment firm Caisse de Dépôt et Placement du Québec, with more than $310 billion under management. Petrobras will keep the remaining 10 percent. Engie said buying TAG, which accounts for 47 percent of Brazil’s entire gas infrastructure and achieved core earnings of $1.14 billion in 2018, would provide a steady stream of profits. It will add to Engie’s presence in Brazil, where its unit owns assets including hydroelectric plants, thermoelectric facilities and renewable energy sources. “Our acquisition of TAG is a significant milestone for Engie in Brazil, a key market for the group where we have been present for 23 years,” said Engie Chief Executive Isabelle Kocher. Under Kocher, Engie has been focusing investments on energy services, renewable energy and infrastructure, while selling out of coal-related assets. “It is a good diversification for Engie,” said Clairinvest fund manager Ion-Marc Valahu, whose firm owns Engie shares. “Also, Engie will benefit from growth expectations in Brazil.” Engie said the acquisition of TAG would result in its net debt increasing by around 1.6 billion euros ($1.8 billion). The consortium secured around $6 billion in financing to help fund the acquisition from 10 banks, three local and seven international. It did not name the lenders. Engie shares edged up 0.6 percent in early trading on hopes the positive elements of the TAG deal would override any concerns over the rise in Engie’s debts. “TAG will allow Engie to accelerate its development in the gas sector in Brazil, where Engie is already present in terms of the country’s electricity sector,” said Roche Brune Asset Management fund manager Gregoire Laverne, who said Engie was a stock his firm was considering buying. The TAG divestment represents a victory for Petrobras’ leadership and its Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco, who is pushing to unload assets in a bid to cut debt and refocus on exploration and production. In September 2016, Petrobras sold a larger gas network pipeline, Nova Transportadora do Sudeste, for $5.2 billion to Brookfield Infrastructure Partners LP, which beat out a bid by Engie."

-2.6782890266090873," Brazil eyes deal on 'transfer of rights' oil area by next week: minister RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil Mines and Energy Minister Bento Albuquerque said on Thursday that he is optimistic that there will be a deal by next week resolving the government’s dispute with Petroleo Brasileiro SA over the offshore oil-producing zone known as the transfer of rights area. Albuquerque said he hoped for a deal in time for the National Energy Policy Council’s (CNPE) meeting set for next week. The CNPE website does not list a date for the meeting. The government is expected to make a multibillion-dollar payment to Petrobras, as the company is known, to resolve a dispute over a 2010 deal that granted the state-controlled firm the rights to extract 5 billion barrels of oil in the area. The amount of oil in the area was later discovered to be much larger. Albuquerque also told reporters that U.S. company Westinghouse had expressed interest in participating in the construction of the Angra 3 nuclear power plant, with the government seeking to open some parts of the project to foreign investors and aiming to restart work on it next year. Work on Angra 3 was halted in 2015, amid allegations of corruption in the contract bidding process. Former Brazilian President Michel Temer was indicted this week on charges that he took part in a bribery scheme related to the nuclear power plant complex."

Petrobras, Engie, Itausa and EIG did not immediately comment. Mubadala declined to comment on the matter. On Monday, Reuters reported that some investors were dropping out of Itausa and EIG/Mubadala’s groups in a move that could leave the group led by Engie in a stronger position. The French company was the winner of the first round and spent months discussing a sale contract with Petrobras.

-4.586220982121838," Chevron takeover of Petrobras Pasadena refinery stalls: sources HOUSTON (Reuters) - A planned transfer of a 112,229 barrel-per-day (bpd) refinery in Pasadena, Texas, to Chevron Corp from Brazil’s state oil company Petrobras stalled on Monday, one day after units were shut at the Houston-area refinery, sources familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. Chevron announced in January it would buy the Pasadena Refining System Inc (PRSI) plant owned by Petrobras for $350 million. “We expected them to take over on Monday,” one of the sources said on Tuesday. Last week, the Brazilian flag and a Petrobras flag were not visible on flag poles in front of the Pasadena refinery. Both have been flying there since Petrobras took over sole ownership of the plant in 2012. On Tuesday, a Petrobras sign in front of the refinery was covered up. “We continue to expect the PRSI transaction to close in the first half of 2019,” said Chevron spokesman Braden Reddall on Tuesday. A Petrobras spokeswoman did not reply to messages on Tuesday seeking to comment On Sunday, PRSI filed notices with the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ) that the electrostatic precipitator (ESP) and the 56,000 bpd gasoline-producing fluidic catalytic cracking unit (FCCU) at the Pasadena refinery were shut for required maintenance. Energy industry intelligence service Genscape said the refinery’s 100,000 bpd crude distillation unit and a 23,000 bpd catalytic reformer were also shut on Sunday at the refinery. The Pasadena refinery was at the center of a corruption probe by the Brazilian government into Petrobras. The company paid more than $1 billion for the plant by the time it took sole ownership in 2012. In addition to the refinery, Chevron is buying a terminal, land surrounding the refinery and a trading company owned by PRSI. Chevron is buying the Pasadena plant to run sweet crude oil it produces in Texas. It will be the second Gulf Coast refinery owned by the company. The CDU does the primary breakdown of crude oil into hydrocarbon feedstocks for all other production units. The reformer produces octane-boosting chemicals added to gasoline. An ESP removes fine catalyst particles from the emissions of the unit. The catalyst is used to convert gas oil into gasoline within an FCCU."

Those departures will likely leave a third group, led by France’s Engie SA with Canadian pension fund Caisse de Depot et Placement du Quebec, stronger. The final bids for TAG, as the unit is known, are due on Tuesday. After the previously reported departure of Australia’s Macquarie Group Ltd from one of the groups, which still includes Brazilian investment firm Itausa Investimentos SA and Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC, the other two investors that were supporting the bid, sovereign wealth fund Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, known as Adia, and investment manager Wren House Infrastructure, also pulled out. A second group, led by Mubadala Investment Company and EIG Global Energy Partners, had been in talks with the world’s largest investment firm, BlackRock Inc, but the company gave up. Wrenhouse, Adia, EIG, Mubadala and Itausa did not immediately comment on the matter. BlackRock, which would have a small stake in TAG, declined to comment. The weakening of the Itausa Investimentos and Mubadala groups raises the chance of Engie, which was the winner of the first bid round, winning the deal. It is not clear if the three groups will deliver the proposals as it was previously expected. The sale of TAG is expected to be the largest divestment in Petrobras’ asset sale program. The oil company expects to fetch around $8 billion. All bids were expected to use a large amount of debt to finance the acquisition, as banks are eager to fund the pipeline, which has an extremely stable cash flow. Still, last-minute changes in the group complicate the financing, one of the sources said."

Petrobras said in a filing it had begun the sale process for Liquigas Distribuidora SA. In February, Reuters reported that Petrobras had hired the investment banking unit of Banco Santander Brasil SA to revive the sale. Petrobras’ management has made asset sales the core element of its bid to pay down debt and re-focus on exploration and production. Next week, the company is due to receive final bids for its TAG pipeline unit, which is expected to fetch several billions dollars. Petrobras had agreed in 2016 to sell Liquigas Distribuidora to local rival Ultrapar Participacoes SA in a 2.8 billion-real ($720 million) deal, that was later blocked by Brazil’s antitrust watchdog Cade in February 2018. Petrobras restricted the participation of rivals with more than 10 percent of market share in the Brazilian LPG distribution market, according to documents filed on Friday. Companies in such conditions may only participate in a consortium, and may not individually have a stake higher than 40 percent of the unit revenue. Financial investors, the main target of the new process due to antitrust concerns, need to have at least $1 billion in assets under management. According to Petrobras, Liquigas Distribuidora operates in 25 of 26 Brazilian states, with 23 operating centers and 4,800 authorized re-sellers."

The Rio de Janeiro-based bank owned a 13.9 percent stake in February, according to Petrobras’ website. The bank’s profit rose in 2018, helped by profits in sales of part of its stakes in Petrobras and in miner Vale SA . Net income reached 6.7 billion reais in 2018, up 9.8 percent from the previous year.

-2.882403619667177," Brazil's Petrobras fines Bolivia for failing to meet LNG deliveries RIO DE JANEIRO, March 26 (Reuters) - Brazilian state-run oil company Petrobras has fined Bolivia’s state oil company YPFB after it failed to deliver liquefied natural gas (LNG) volumes secured under a contract through the Bolivia-Brazil pipeline during 2018, a Petrobras executive said on Tuesday. Marcelo Cruz, the executive manager of gas and energy at Petroleo Brasileiro SA, declined to reveal the value of the fine, citing confidentiality, but confirmed that it was a “relevant” amount. Cruz, who spoke to Reuters by phone, said the fine, paid last week, was aimed at offsetting possible losses for Petrobras, which ends up having to compensate the volumes from other sources. “At the moment it does not deliver the gas, I end up having to go to the market and buy LNG. On average, LNG is more expensive than Bolivian gas,” Cruz said. “The spirit of the fine is this: to compensate for any losses that may occur.” Cruz said YPFB had not been able to deliver the volumes Petrobras needed due to a reduction of exploratory investments in recent years, which had led to a drop in production. Bolivia’s domestic needs had also grown, constricting supply, he said. Last year, Petrobras demanded an average of 26 million cubic meters per day of natural gas, while YPFB delivered 22.6 million, according to official figures. Due to Bolivia’s difficulties, Cruz said companies are negotiating a possible revision of the volume of gas contracted. (Reporting by Gabriel Stargardter; Editing by Leslie Adler)"

The options expire by the end of the year. Brent crude futures hovered around $67 per barrel in international markets on Friday. Oil futures for 2019 and 2020 have soared some 20 percent to their highest levels this year. The filing confirmed a Reuters report this week that said Petrobras, as the company is known, was hedging oil at $60. The put options give Petrobras the right to deliver oil at $60, but not the obligation to do so. If prices remain above that level, the company can let the options expire without exercising that right, although in that case they would lose the $320 million price they paid for the options. Petrobras is spending less this year than it did in 2018 on hedging. Last year, the company had put options covering 128 million barrels, at an exercise price of $65 per barrel. Thadeu Silva, an oil analyst at broker INTL FCStone, said Petrobras’ hedging strategy for this year is adequate. “It is a cost that is worth it. The company is spending around 7 percent of the value of its oil exports to protect that value,” he said. He said Petrobras is hedging only a part of its expected exports, partially covering the risk of Brent possibly falling below $60 per barrel, which is not a very likely outlook currently, he said."

-6.809827951665544," Exclusive: Trident Energy takes lead in Petrobras oilfield sale - sources RIO DE JANEIRO/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Warburg Pincus-backed firm Trident Energy is in exclusive talks with Petroleo Brasileiro SA to acquire a pair of Brazilian oil clusters, two sources with knowledge of the matter said this week, as the state-run company known as Petrobras moves to revive the sale effort. Petrobras had agreed in July to enter into exclusive talks with Ouro Preto Oleo e Gas, a Brazilian energy company backed by private equity firm EIG Global Energy Partners, to sell its Pampo and Enchova shallow water oil clusters off the coast of Rio de Janeiro. At the time, the clusters were expected to fetch around $1 billion. However, Ouro Preto reduced its offer and Petrobras walked away, Reuters reported in January. Petrobras has since entered exclusive talks with Trident Energy, which had bid for the fields in 2018 but did not enter into direct talks with Petrobras because its offer was below Ouro Preto’s offer, according to the sources. Trident was set up by former executives of independent Anglo-French oil firm Perenco in 2016. Its portfolio is comprised of production assets located in Equatorial Guinea. An acquisition of the Pampo and Enchova clusters in Brazil’s Campos Basin would mark its first foothold outside of Africa. Petrobras and Trident did not respond to requests for comment. Petrobras is currently divesting a wide range of mature onshore and offshore oilfields, among other assets, in a bid to cut debt and refocus on Brazil’s promising deepwater ‘pre-salt’ play. Last week, Petrobras CEO Roberto Castello Branco said he expected the company would complete $10 billion in divestments in the first four months of 2019. The quick pivot to Trident after the collapse of talks with Ouro Preto illustrates the resolve of Petrobras to push ahead with those asset disposals. The often complex sales have proceeded in fits and starts. Should Petrobras and Trident come to terms, the sources said, Petrobras will likely hold a final rebidding round, in which competing parties, including Ouro Preto, can submit final bids of varying values for Pampo and Enchova, so long as those bids have the same contractual terms as any agreement with Trident. Together, Pampo and Enchova produced almost 39,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, according to July figures, making it the largest mature production asset in Petrobras’ divestment portfolio."
-7.899460844264931," Brazil's PetroReconcavo in talks for Petrobras onshore fields: sources RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian independent oil company PetroReconcavo has entered direct negotiations with state-run Petroleo Brasileiro SA to purchase a cluster of 34 oilfields in the nation’s northeast, two oil industry sources told Reuters. Petrobras, as the state-owned company is known, entered talks with the unlisted Salvador, Brazil-based company after upstart 3R Petroleum failed to receive financing for its $453 million purchase of the fields, which was announced in late November, said the sources, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss internal matters. The sources said the $453 million bid was considered aggressive, and PetroReconcavo will probably offer less for the fields in the state of Rio Grande do Norte, collectively known as Riacho da Forquilha. Petrobras did not respond to a request for comment, nor did Ricardo Savini, a partner at 3R Petroleum. Marcelo Magalhaes, chief executive of PetroReconcavo, declined to comment. Petrobras, Brazil’s largest company by market capitalization, is aggressively selling off non-core assets to reduce its hefty debt load and focus on deepwater exploration and production. While much attention is geared toward items such as its TAG pipeline unit, expected to fetch several billion dollars, the company is also pushing ahead with divesting dozens of shallow-water and onshore oil and gas fields. Still, such asset disposals often face bumpy paths. In January, Reuters reported that Petrobras walked away from an offer by an EIG Energy Partners-backed firm to purchase two shallow-water oilfields. The PetroReconcavo talks were first reported by Upstream Online. The trade publication also reported that Petrobras had entered into exclusive talks with Brazilian independent oil firm Petro Rio SA regarding the sale of its Bauna shallow-water oilfield. In January, Reuters reported that Petro Rio and Australia’s Karoon Energy Ltd were among the firms to bid on the field. Karavan Oil and Gas, a Brazilian upstart with a close working relationship with Schlumberger NV, also bid for the field, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Petro Rio did not respond to a request for comment. When Petrobras announced in late November that it had reached a deal with 3R Petroleum to sell Riacho da Forquilha, it aroused suspicions among industry groups and labor unions, who were concerned about the firm’s upstart status and lack of a clear financing structure. In an internal document from late last year, PetroReconcavo said it planned to bid for multiple Petrobras onshore oilfields, and had already submitted a binding offer for a gas-heavy cluster of fields known as Miranga. Relatively small Riacho da Forquilha was producing 8,748 barrels per day (bpd) of oil and 332,000 cubic meters per day of gas as of late 2016, according to the latest public figures by Petrobras. Still, it is among the larger production assets currently on the block."

At the same event in Rio de Janeiro, Brazilian Economy Minister Paulo Guedes said Petrobras, as the firm is known, has almost settled on terms with the government regarding a dispute over an oil-producing zone known as the transfer-of-rights area. The resolution of that spat would results in billions of dollars more being added to the company’s coffers. Petrobras is aggressively divesting non-core assets in a bid to reduce its hefty debt load, which has steadily fallen in recent years but is still above that of its peers. On Wednesday, sources told Reuters that the firm is accepting the final round of bids for its TAG gas pipeline unit on April 2, which is expected to bring in several billion dollars and will likely be the company’s largest-ever asset sale. At Friday’s event, Castello Branco said he believes the TAG deal will be among the divestments completed by the end of April, bringing Petrobras’ total divestments in the first four months of 2019 to some $10 billion. Speaking at the same event, Economy Minister Guedes, without specifying the currency, said Petrobras and the government had started off 60 billion apart in their negotiating positions regarding the transfer-of-rights area, but were now only 2 billion apart. The figures likely refer to dollars, as the two sides at one point each believed they were owed $30 billion. The transfer-of-rights area is the result of a 2010 deal between the Brazilian government and Petrobras related to a huge share offering that would have diluted the government’s stake. To maintain control of the company, the government sold Petrobras the rights to explore 5 billion barrels of oil in an area off Brazil’s coast for 74.8 billion reais at the time. With that money, it bought additional Petrobras shares. But Brazil’s oil regulator now estimates there are around 17 billion barrels of recoverable oil in the area, and the government is seeking to auction rights for the exploration of the excess oil. First, the two sides need to resolve the dispute over the area, which will result in a significant payment to Petrobras."

According to the legal document, the company filed a request on Wednesday that would allow it to present arguments and defend its points of view regarding a major case before Brazil’s Supreme Court, which concerns the sale of subsidiaries by state-run firms. Petrobras press representatives declined to comment. In July, Petrobras, as the firm is widely known, suspended the sale of certain refineries, a gas pipeline network known as TAG and a fertilizer plant, after Supreme Court Justice Ricardo Lewandowski issued a provisional ruling that state-owned firms needed congressional approval for certain types of divestments. However, in January, Brazil’s solicitor-general issued an opinion arguing that those divestments could in fact go ahead. Petrobras is now deep into the divestment process for its TAG pipeline unit, which is expected to fetch several billion dollars. The three groups interested in the pipeline may present new bids through April 2. Executives have said they are also drafting terms for the sale of two groups of refineries. Still, Lewandowski, the Supreme Court justice, has yet to issue a final ruling, which is expected to uphold or modify his previous injunction. The contents of the final ruling could impact divestments not only by Petrobras, but also by other state-run companies, such as banks Caixa Economica Federal and Banco do Brasil SA. Among the arguments that Petrobras makes in the filing is that a previous presidential decree allows for the kinds of divestments the firm is carrying out. It also argues that the firm needs autonomy regarding certain divestments in order to remain competitive. “The freedom to enter into ownership of a company is worth nothing if the company cannot get out, especially if remaining generates losses or immobilizes resources that could be applied more efficiently in other business areas,” the company said in the document."

Petrobras said last year it would sell some of its refineries in the Northeastern and Southern regions. The move is part of an effort to pay off its high debt load after becoming entangled in a corruption scandal. “This is a process that we have been discussing among Petrobras, the government, and we are talking with many actors to deal with this subject,” said Bento Albuquerque, Brazil’s minister of mines and energy, in an interview on the sidelines of IHS Markit’s CERAWeek conference in Houston."

Petrobras said it intends to reach that economy on costs mainly with reductions in expenses with employees -- it will launch a voluntary lay-off plan soon -- and with lower expenditures in advertisement and office spaces. The company said the proposed cuts on operational costs will reduce that allocation in its 2019-2023 business plan, which originally estimated those costs at $122.6 billion for the 5-year plan. It also said it plans to sell some mature oil fields in Brazil, a small addition to its divestment program."

-8.575165007553784," Petrobras to push ahead with 'bold' divestment plan: CEO RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Petroleo Brasileiro SA is expanding its ambitious divestment program and has “bold” plans for future sales, the Brazilian state-run oil company’s chief executive said after the firm reported its first annual profit in five years. On a post-results conference call with analysts on Thursday, CEO Roberto Castello Branco said selling non-core assets will be the key to reducing debt. Shallow-water and onshore fields are among the first on the block, while the company hopes to complete the sale of its TAG pipeline unit “soon” and several options are being considered for the future of distribution unit Petrobras Distribuidora SA, executives said. The company will have a new model for the sale of refineries, a process that would bring in billions of dollars, “perhaps within three months,” Castello Branco told reporters on a separate call. Petrobras, as the company is known, can reduce its ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or EBITDA, to 1.5 or even to 1, with the help of divestments, he added. The ratio at the close of the fourth quarter was 2.34. The University of Chicago-educated CEO, who took the reins in early January, has long been vocal about the need to slim down the sprawling company and focus on core activities such as exploration and production. Thursday’s comments were some of his most assertive on the matter. Debt reduction could occur through various initiatives, the most important of which are “a more aggressive divestment program and getting out of assets where we’re not a natural owner,” Castello Branco said. “Really, get out - not sell a part of the asset.” The company posted a fourth-quarter profit on Wednesday night of 2.102 billion reais ($564 million). That was significantly below analysts’ expectations, impacted by more than 11 billion reais of one-time writedowns and judicial contingencies. Still, analysts were generally pleased by strong free-cash flow and steady debt reduction. EBITDA came in roughly in line with expectations. Brazil’s energy council said separately on Thursday it had scheduled for Oct. 28 an auction of deepwater oilfields that will follow the resolution of a complex dispute between Petrobras and the government over the so-called transfer-of-rights area. While the dispute in question has not yet been resolved, it will result in a significant windfall for Petrobras when the parties finally come to terms. Castello Branco said any proceeds from that resolution were not part of Petrobras’ deleveraging plan, and could be used to participate in the auction. Brazil-listed preferred shares of Petrobras were in the black in morning trade, but were off 0.96 percent by the afternoon. That still beat Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa index, which was down 1.63 percent."

-8.575165007553784," Exclusive: Petrobras oil trader to plead guilty in U.S. money-laundering case - documents HOUSTON (Reuters) - A former U.S.-based oil trader sought in Brazil over a multimillion-dollar bribery scheme involving commodities traders Vitol, Glencore and Trafigura has agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit money-laundering in the United States, court records show. The plea is part of a cooperation agreement by a key figure in Brazil’s “Car Wash” probe into corruption at state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA, according to people familiar with the matter. That scandal has toppled presidents in two countries and sent more than 130 politicians and businessmen to jail across Latin America. Rodrigo Garcia Berkowitz, who worked as a trader for Petrobras in Houston until last year, waived an indictment and offered to plead guilty to the charge, according to documents filed in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn. The court accepted the request and set sentencing for Sept. 13. Berkowitz is among 12 former Petrobras employees and middlemen charged in Brazil in December in connection with a scheme that Brazilian investigators have said offered Vitol, Glencore, Trafigura lower prices for oil and services and then shared in the savings, authorities have said. The activities took place between 2011 and 2014. Vitol declined to comment on the plea agreement, adding it has a zero tolerance policy for bribery and corruption and cooperates fully with relevant authorities. Petrobras said it fired Berkowitz and is working with prosecutors in Brazil. Glencore, which could not immediately be reached for comment, has said in the past it was cooperating with Brazilian authorities. Trafigura has said it took the allegations seriously. The conspiracy to commit money laundering documents do not name Berkowitz. The case is against John Doe, a pseudonym that prosecutors sometimes use to keep the names of individuals involved in an investigation out of the public eye. But Berkowitz signed his name to an application to plead guilty that was filed with court records. The application was approved by Judge Raymond Dearie, of federal court in Brooklyn. Kent Schaffer, a top Houston criminal defense attorney who signed court papers to represent John Doe, confirmed that Berkowitz is the individual named in the documents. He declined other comment. Berkowitz, who is living in the United States, has been cooperating with New York prosecutors who opened a probe into the allegations, the people familiar with the matter have said. John Marzulli, a spokesman for U.S. Attorney Richard Donoghue, for the Eastern District of New York, declined to comment. Bribes allegedly paid to Petrobras insiders moved through bank accounts in the United States, Britain, Sweden, Switzerland and Uruguay, Brazilian authorities have said, paving the way for U.S. prosecutors to probe for violations of U.S. money laundering laws. The U.S. attorneys office for the Eastern District of New York that struck the plea agreement with Berkowitz has worked hand-in-hand with Brazilian prosecutors in the Car Wash probe in the past. In late 2016, they jointly negotiated with construction firm Odebrecht to reach a deal that resulted in a $2.6 billion fine."
-8.575165007553784," Brazil's Petrobras posts first annual profit in five years, despite writedowns RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian state-run oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro SA reported its first annual profit in five years on Wednesday as it swung to a net profit in the fourth quarter, although one-time provisions and writedowns led it to miss estimates. In a securities filing, Petrobras, as the company is known, said fourth-quarter net income rose to 2.102 billion reais ($564 million), compared with a loss of almost 5.5 billion reais in the same period a year earlier. Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco, who took the reins in January, called 2018 the best year in some time, while adding that there was still much more to be done across several business segments. Net income for full-year 2018 came to 25.779 billion reais, the company’s first full-year profit since 2013. That figure widely missed the Refinitiv I/B/E/S estimate of 34.9 billion reais, due in large part to impairments and contingencies related to legal disputes. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, minus non-recurring items (adjusted EBITDA) rose 50 percent to 115 billion reais, just below the Refinitiv estimate of 118 billion reais. Petrobras took charges of around 11.4 billion reais in the fourth quarter for various impairments and money put aside as judicial contingencies. Among the major sources of writedowns was the settlement of a royalties dispute with regulator ANP over an oil producing zone known as Parque das Baleias, as well as an arbitration dispute with U.S.-based Vantage Drilling Co. “The results in our opinion are great. We’ve been living with one-off charges since the first settlement of Car Wash,” said James Gulbrandsen, chief investment officer for Latin American investments at NCH Capital, referring to a graft investigation that has hit Petrobras in recent years. The company’s ratio of net debt to EBITDA fell to 2.34 at the end of the year, beating the company’s goal of 2.5 as widely expected. The firm boosted production of oil and natural gas liquids to 2.115 million barrels per day in the fourth quarter, up 5 percent from the prior quarter. ($1 = 3.73 reais)"

The share offering of the 2.3 percent stake owned by Caixa in Petrobras, as the oil company is known, depends on the publication of a new presidential decree authorizing the sale, the sources said, asking not to be named as the plans had not been made public. President Jair Bolsonaro has already signed a first decree authorizing Caixa to sell its Petrobras stake, but the decree had technical mistakes and needed to be republished, they said. Once the new decree is signed, Caixa will hire investment banks to help manage the secondary share offering. Press representatives at Caixa Federal declined to comment. Caixa plans to use the proceeds to pay off roughly 40 billion reais in convertible bonds sold to the Brazilian government between 2007 and 2013. Petrobras common shares were up 1.15 percent at 30.86 reais on Tuesday in Sao Paulo trading, and has accumulated a 36 percent gain over the last 12 months. The sale of the Petrobras stake will be the second divestiture led by Caixa since Chief Executive Pedro Guimaraes took the helm at the state bank last month, after the sale of a 2.4 billion reais stake in reinsurer IRB Brasil Resseguros SA. The IRB share offering will be priced later on Tuesday. The IRB shares are owned by a government fund responsible for financing education and managed by Caixa. Caixa owns 3.2 percent of Petrobras common stock directly and 1 percent of non-voting capital. Both transactions will be led by Caixa’s recently created investment banking unit, with around 30 bankers recruited internally. Guimarães has said he intends to list at least four Caixa units: asset management, credit cards, lottery and insurance. Guimaraes recently appointed new senior management officials at Caixa.

-10.643412359459033," Brazil's chicken exporter BRF appoints new CFO, shares jump SAO PAULO, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Brazilian food processor BRF SA appointed former Petrobras Chief Executive Ivan Monteiro as its new chief financial officer, lifting shares of the world’s largest chicken exporter by more than 4 percent. The move reunites Monteiro with Pedro Parente, a turnaround specialist who served as Petroleo Brasileiro SA CEO for two years and who is now BRF’s chief executive and chairman. Monteiro worked under Parente as financial and investor relations officer at the state-controlled company, then succeeded Parente when he resigned in June of 2018 amid a contentious truckers’ strike over fuel prices. Parente was named to the top job at BRF in the middle of last year after the company’s shareholders demanded a management shakeup following a string of bad financial results and the firm’s involvement in a food sector investigation. Monteiro was replaced at Petrobras by newly elected President Jair Bolsonaro, who took office in January. BRF shares rose by as much as 4.6 percent to 24.79 reais in mid-morning trading on Monteiro’s appointment, seen as boosting investor confidence the food company can be revived after a probe found evidence that BRF and accredited laboratories were evading food safety checks. In a statement on Tuesday, BRF said that Monteiro’s appointment as BRF financial vice-president is conditioned on approval by the president’s public ethics committee, since the executive recently served as an executive at a publicly traded state-run company. Elcio Ito, who was working as BRF financial vice-president and investors relations officer, will step down after a transition period, BRF said. (Reporting by Ana Mano Editing by Nick Zieminski)"
-9.129634096908397," PetroRio wants to buy Petrobras stake in Frade oil field: source RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian independent oil firm PetroRio SA, which already owns 70 percent of the Frade oil field, has approached Petrobras about buying its 30 percent stake in the field, a person familiar with the matter said. PetroRio recently signed a deal to buy Chevron Corp’s majority stake in the mature deepwater oil field. PetroRio, seeking more flexibility to pursue the Petrobras transaction and other upcoming deals, struck an agreement with Chevron for a deferred payment scheme in return for its stake in the field, said the person, who requested anonymity to discuss internal matters. The value of PetroRio’s deal with Chevron has not been disclosed. PetroRio, based in Rio de Janeiro, last year bought an 18.3 percent stake in the Frade field. It said on Wednesday it had agreed to purchase Chevron’s majority stake in the field, located in the Campos basin off the coast of Rio de Janeiro state. This deal brought PetroRio’s total oil production to 28,000 barrels of oil per day. The company, which specializes in acquiring stakes in mature fields and boosting their productivity, now owns 70 percent of Frade. It said its stake there accounts for about 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (bpoed) production. The structure of the purchase will allow PetroRio to pay Chevron in large part using revenue from Frade, the person said. That will help the firm pursue further acquisitions, such as the Petrobras stake. PetroRio, Petrobras and Chevron did not return calls seeking comment. Petrobras (Petroleo Brasileiro SA) is divesting its stake in many producing fields to focus on an area deep under the ocean floor where billions of barrels of oil are struck underneath a layer of salt. PetroRio, meanwhile, is attempting to gobble up stakes in the relatively mature fields that Petrobras and other international oil companies are exiting. Among the Petrobras assets that PetroRio has bid for, Reuters reported in January, is the Petrobras shallow-water Bauna field, which produces about 34,000 bpoed."

-4.81249855768122," Chevron to buy Pasadena refinery from Petrobras for $350 mln HOUSTON (Reuters) - Chevron Corp said on Wednesday it would pay $350 million to buy a refinery in Pasadena, Texas, from Brazilian state oil company Petrobras, confirming a Reuters report from Monday. In addition to the 110,000-barrel-per-day (bpd) refinery, Chevron will take ownership of a 466-acre (188.5 hectares)complex on the Houston Ship Channel that includes storage tanks with capacity for 5.1 million barrels of crude oil and refined products, as well as 143 acres of additional land, the company said. “This expansion of our Gulf Coast refining system enables Chevron to process more domestic light crude, supply a portion of our retail market in Texas and Louisiana with Chevron-produced products, and realize synergies through coordination with our refinery in Pascagoula,” said Pierre Breber, executive vice president of Chevron downstream & chemicals. Chevron, which reported a 150,000-bpd increase in shale production in the third quarter, has said it wants a second Gulf Coast facility to handle that crude and better supply its retail gasoline network. The Pasadena refinery produces mostly gasoline and distillates such as diesel. The deal includes all of Petrobras subsidiary Pasadena Refining System Inc, which operates the refinery and tank farm and owns the adjoining property, and PRSI Trading LLC.

1.8555361483315873," Exclusive: Chevron to buy Texas refinery from Brazil's Petrobras - sources HOUSTON (Reuters) - Chevron Corp has agreed to buy a Texas oil refinery with a troubled past and space to handle a coming flow of shale from its West Texas operations, two sources familiar with negotiations said on Monday. The U.S. oil major is expected to disclose the deal to acquire a 112,000 barrel-per-day (bpd) refinery in Pasadena, Texas, this quarter, the sources said. The plant is operated by Pasadena Refining System Inc, a Texas-based unit of Brazil’s state-run oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro SA. Chevron spokesman Braden Reddall declined to comment on Monday. Carlos Monteiro, a spokesman for Petrobras in Rio de Janeiro, said any communications on an agreement would be disclosed to the market. A deeply indebted Petrobras put the plant on the market in early 2018 after sinking more than $1.18 billion into it since it acquired its first stake in the operation in 2006. Chevron and Petrobras’ negotiations were delayed in part by Brazil’s presidential election and pipeline operator Kinder Morgan Inc dropping out of talks to operate a terminal at the site as a joint venture, the sources said. Kinder Morgan spokeswoman Lexey Long declined to comment. Petrobras has been looking to divest $21 billion in assets to reduce its debt load amid a series of corruption scandals including allegations bribes were paid to executives as a result of the 2006 purchase of the Pasadena plant. The rapid expansion of U.S. shale production from the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico has stirred demand for new U.S. refining capacity and crude-export facilities. Oil output has soared to an estimated 3.8 million bpd this month, from 1.48 million five years ago. Chevron, which reported a 150,000 bpd increase in shale production in the third quarter, has said it wants a second Gulf Coast facility to handle that crude and better supply its retail gasoline network. The plant produces mostly gasoline and distillates such as diesel. The refinery covers 192 acres on the Houston Ship Channel and the purchase includes another 274 acres of terminal and other cleared land available for expansion. The site has storage tanks that can hold 5.1 million barrels and a marine terminal for exports. The plant’s 300-strong work force is represented by the United Steelworkers union, and would become Chevron employees once the deal is completed. There are several small U.S. refineries on the market. Husky Energy Inc earlier this month began marketing a 12,000-bpd refinery in Prince George, British Columbia. Royal Dutch Shell recently began accepting bids for its 75,000-bpd Sarnia, Ontario, refinery, according to people familiar with the matter. Delta Air Lines Inc last September began marketing a stake in its 185,000-bpd Trainer, Pennsylvania, refinery. In November, CVR Energy Inc said it may buy out the public holders of its refining unit, CVR Refining GP, which operates refineries in Kansas and Oklahoma. That decision would unwind a partnership making a future sale easier."
-1.1598026177382414," Engie and CDPQ eye loans of up to US$8bn for Petrobras’ TAG pipeline NEW YORK, Jan 24 (LPC) - French electric utility Engie and Canadian pension fund Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ) are raising a loan of up to US$8bn to back the purchase of a natural gas pipeline system in Brazil from state-owned oil company Petróleo Brasileiro (Petrobras), banking sources said. Engie and CDPQ are talking to at least eight international banks including BNP Paribas, Mizuho and Sumitomo Bank. Brazilian banks Itaú Unibanco, Banco do Brasil and Bradesco are also expected to commit to the financing, the sources said. The financing package for the Transportadora Associada de Gás (TAG) pipeline unit is expected to have a maturity of eight to ten years, and will likely be raised at the target company level. Loans for Latin American companies usually have maturities of three to five years, and the longer maturity shows confidence in the credit, the sources said. Petrobras was in exclusive talks with Engie and CDPQ over the sale of TAG last year, before the sale was stalled by an injunction from Brazil’s Supreme Court in July, which required the country’s Congress to approve the sale of any state-owned asset. Brazil’s solicitor general overturned the injunction in early January, allowing Petrobras to reopen bidding for potential buyers interested in buying TAG. Before the injunction, Engie and CDPQ had submitted the highest bid for TAG, which operates natural gas pipelines in Brazil’s north and northeast. Other consortiums that also expressed interest in the assets included a group comprising EIG Global Energy Partners and the United Arab Emirates’ sovereign wealth fund Mubadala and a party made up of Australian investor Macquarie, Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB), sources previously told LPC. Engie, CDPQ, Petrobras and the banks declined to comment or could not immediately be reached for comment. Petrobras Chief Executive Officer Roberto Castello Branco is expected to push forward with divestment and partnership opportunities in the distribution and natural gas businesses after taking over from Ivan Monteiro in January. Petrobras is expected to be the highest spending oil and gas firm in South America through 2025, according to figures from GlobalData. Castello Branco will also prioritize investment into the more profitable deepwater oil and gas exploration and production segments. The Brazilian oil giant is estimated to need approximately US$49.4bn over the next six years for almost 40 project opportunities, data and analytics firm GlobalData said in a report on January 22. “Petrobras’ planned and announced projects mainly focused on upstream production projects and refineries,” said Soorya Tejomoortula, an oil and gas analyst at GlobalData. The company’s exit from natural gas distribution started to take shape in September 2016 when it sold Nova Transportadora do Sudeste (NTS), a pipeline operator in Brazil’s south and southeast, for US$5.2bn to a group comprised of Canadian investors Brookfield Asset Management and British Columbia Investment Management Corp, as well as Singapore’s GIC and the China Investment Corp. Petrobras’ latest five-year investment plan, unveiled on December 5, seeks to raise close to US$27bn from divestments and partnerships. Proceeds from asset sales will go towards lowering Petrobras’ debt load, which is considered one of the largest among oil and gas firms. Net debt was roughly 291.8bn (US$77.5bn) Brazilian reais at the end of the third quarter, Petrobras said in its quarterly results presentation. (Reporting by Aaron Weinman.

2.0671972509063212," Exclusive: Petrobras rejects latest EIG-backed bid for oilfields - sources RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Petroleo Brasileiro SA PETR4.SA has rejected the most recent bid by an EIG Global Energy Partners-backed firm to purchase a pair of shallow-water oil clusters, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said, potentially derailing a major divestment late in the process. Ouro Preto Oleo e Gas, a Brazilian energy firm backed by sector-focused private equity firm EIG entered exclusive talks in July with Petrobras, as the state-run oil firm is known, to purchase its Pampo and Enchova clusters. At the time, the fields, located in the Campos Basin off the coast of Rio de Janeiro, were seen fetching around $1 billion. Petrobras is cutting stakes in shallow-water fields to focus on Brazil’s larger deepwater play. That is creating an opportunity for smaller oil companies and private equity firms eager to extract value from relatively mature assets. But the process has been rocky at times. For Petrobras, the collapse or delay of the Pampo and Enchova deal could hurt its bid to meet an ambitious divestment target of $26.9 billion over five years. With combined oil production of about 39,000 barrels per day, Pampo and Enchova is the largest mature production asset currently in Petrobras’ divestment portfolio. In December, Petrobras reopened bidding for the clusters, as Brazil’s federal audit court, known as the TCU, requires for most Petrobras divestitures. Under the final rebidding round, investors can submit bids of varying values, so long as they have the same contractual terms as the winning bid in the original round. Ouro Preto took advantage of the rebidding process to cut its offer, due in part to a drop in oil prices, Reuters reported in December. [nL1N1YJ1P0] However, Petrobras, unhappy with Ouro Preto’s price cut, has rejected the consortium’s updated bid, according to the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss confidential matters. EIG and Ouro Preto declined to comment. Petrobras did not respond to a request for comment. The setback underlines the slow, at times convoluted process surrounding Petrobras’ divestments, which have often frustrated potential buyers. The next steps in the Pampo and Enchova divestiture are unclear. One of the sources said the Ouro Preto consortium may try to come back to the table to resume bilateral negotiations with Petrobras. Should Petrobras re-open the process to other potential buyers or open a fresh bidding round, it could create an opportunity for firms like Trident Energy, backed by private equity firm Warburg Pincus, which had submitted an offer for Pampo and Enchova during the original bidding round in mid-2018. Trident did not respond to a request for comment."

Joaquim Levy, a former finance minister and the new CEO of BNDES, used his swearing-in speech to pledge transparency. For several years now, BNDES has been trying to divest assets and stakes in public companies. Levy's predecessor said last year that it ""makes no sense"" for the Brazilian development bank to hold stakes in companies such as Vale VALE3.SA, Eletrobras ELET6.SA, JBS JBSS3.SA and Eletropaulo ELPL3.SA. Earlier this month, Levy said the pace of sales of stakes owned by the bank’s investment arm will depend on prices and the market impact of the transactions."

Netherlands-based LyondellBasell first said it had entered into exclusive talks to acquire control of Braskem from Brazilian conglomerate Odebrecht SA [ODBES.UL] in June. However, the deal’s price depends on a long-term naphtha supply contract with state-controlled Petroleo Brasileiro SA, which also owns shares in Braskem. The current contract with the state-controlled oil company, known as Petrobras, expires in December 2020. The sources, who requested anonymity to discuss private talks, said a draft naphtha supply agreement was reached in December under former Petrobras Chief Executive Officer Ivan Monteiro. But Monteiro declined to ratify the deal when it became clear he would be replaced under the newly elected administration of far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, the people said. Lyondell representatives are now waiting to hear whether there will be any changes to the Petrobras team that was negotiating the contract and for the talks to resume, one of the sources added. Jorge Celestino Ramos, Petrobras’ refining and natural gas director, who had headed the team, was replaced earlier this month by Anelise Lara. Odebrecht and Petrobras expect a premium on the value of their stakes. Braskem’s current market capitalization on the Sao Paulo stock exchange is around $38.5 billion reais ($10 billion). The delay in negotiations is putting additional pressure on corruption-ensnared Odebrecht SA, which is trying to restructure around 70 billion reais in debt. The conglomerate has managed so far to avoid filing for bankruptcy protection, but a fourth source with knowledge of the matter said the alternative cannot be ruled out completely. Still, Odebrecht expects to receive a formal bid by the end of March, a fifth source with knowledge of the matter said, adding that it hopes Petrobras’ new management will ratify the previously negotiated supply agreement. Petrobras, Odebrecht and LyondellBasell all declined to comment. Shares of Braskem, which were down before the Reuters report, extended losses. Common shares were 2.9 percent down at 46.90 reais in late afternoon trading and preferred shares were down 1.64 percent, at 47.40 reais. Another deal that was hinging on the political change, the tie-up between Embraer SA and Boeing Co, has already been approved by the new Bolsonaro government. Any deal to sell Odebrecht’s 38 percent controlling stake in Braskem needs to be approved by the conglomerate’s creditors. The stake is pledged as collateral for Odebrecht’s largest banking loans. Local banks such as Banco Bradesco SA and Itau Unibanco Holding SA also hold the rights over all of Braskem’s dividends to service the debt. Banks claim they would own the Braskem stake if Odebrecht were to default on the loans. Under Brazilian law covering this type of collateral, creditors become formal owners of the stake in the case of a default. But one of the people said other creditors, such as bondholders of the Odebrecht’s construction unit, could try to challenge the banks’ claim on the stake if there is a bankruptcy protection filing by the holding."

The disclosure raises tough questions for new far-right President Jair Bolsonaro and Petrobras Chief Executive Roberto Castello Branco, who have vowed to end years of graft involving the oil company and Brazil’s political class. Nominee John Forman was fined 338,500 reais ($91,540) by the CVM in 2016 for insider trading, according to the documents seen by Reuters. The news was first reported by newspaper Valor Economico, which said the sentence did not bar him from sitting on the boards of public companies. Forman and Petrobras, as the company is known, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Forman, who has appealed the ruling unsuccessfully so far, has not paid the fine. In a statement, the CVM said it “would adopt the necessary measures to receive payment of the outstanding amount.” Forman, a former director of national oil regulator ANP, is one of three nominees that the government wants to sit on the board of the oil firm. The nominations come amid accusations that Castello Branco has been pushing to oust other board members. Forman was fined for the sale of shares in HRT Participações em Petróleo, where he used to work. The CVM found that Forman was involved in moving shares ahead of the publication of a regulatory filing about a development in an oil exploration project in Namibia. Forman told Valor that the dispute with CVM had been settled, but did not give any further details. He confirmed to the paper that he had not paid the fine."

In a statement, Petrobras said it had told the National Council for Energy Policy (CNPE) that it wanted to operate, with a 30 percent stake, the Aram, Norte de Brava and Sudoeste de Sagitário blocks. It said the fixed signing bonus would be equivalent to 1.845 billion reais ($499 million). Petrobras added that it could increase its stake from 30 percent by forming a consortium to participate in the bidding. Besides the three blocks in question, the sixth pre-salt deep water auction will also offer Cruzeiro do Sul and Bumerangue fields. “In relation to areas where Petrobras has not exercised its preferential right, the company may participate on an equal footing with other bidders, whether acting as operator or non-operator,” it said.

Judge Dias Toffoli’s decision, signed on Friday, overturned an injunction issued by a colleague last month. Toffoli’s ruling should hold until Feb. 27, when the full Supreme Court will hear the case. The December injunction, following a lawsuit filed by the opposition Workers Party, raised doubts about the ability of Petrobras, as the company is known, to carry out the divestments as planned.

7.7174547134291265," New Petrobras CEO pushes to oust board members: sources RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - The new chief executive of Brazil's Petroleo Brasileiro SA PETR4.SA is pushing for the ouster of two of the state-controlled oil company's board members, three people with knowledge of the matter said on Friday. Roberto Castello Branco is seeking the resignation of two Petrobras board members, Segen Estefen and Durval Soledade, whose mandates were only supposed to end in 2020. Brazilian newspaper Valor Economico was first to report that Castello Branco was pushing for their exit. The people, who asked for anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter, said that if the board members do not agree to resign, the government can call for a shareholders’ meeting to elect new board members. One of the sources said the pressure for the directors’ resignation is viewed within Petrobras as a threat to corporate governance rules approved as the company sought to shield the company from undue political influence. Such influence was found to be a big factor in the kickbacks and graft uncovered at Petrobras in Brazil’s largest ever corruption probe. A second source said both board members were frequently at odds with Castello Branco’s enemies when he worked at the company in 2015 and 2016. Chairman Nelson Guedes and board member Francisco Petros resigned earlier in January, and Jerônimo Antunes was appointed as interim chairman last week. Valor Economico also reported that the pressure to oust the board members was related to a “transfer-of-rights” dispute with the government, worth billions of dollars and related to a promising offshore oil area. None of the sources who spoke to Reuters confirmed that version of events. With the departure of Estefen and Santos, the new government would designate four of 11 board members at Petrobras, given the recent resignation of two other board members. Petrobras did not reply to requests for comment. In the past, Economy Minister Paulo Guedes has railed against the state’s outsized role in the Brazilian economy, even proposing that Petrobras and other state-run firms be privatized or split up. Preferred shares of Petrobras were down 1.2 percent in late afternoon trading, compared with a more than the 0.15 percent decline in the benchmark Bovespa stock index .BVSP. Earlier this week, Petrobras said the country’s audit court was analyzing a potential $14 billion government payment to the company to settle the transfer of rights issue. The Economy Ministry has denied that the final settlement will be that high."
7.7174547134291265," Exclusive: Trafigura refuses to hand over emails in Brazil bribery case SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Commodities trader Trafigura [TRAFGF.UL] has refused a judge’s order to hand over the email archives of two former executives in Brazil who are facing corruption charges over accusations they bribed officials at state-run oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro. Brazilian federal prosecutors on Friday demanded in a court filing that the Switzerland-based firm preserve the emails. They may contain evidence that other top executives at Trafigura were aware of millions of dollars in bribes paid to Petrobras PETR4.SA executives for sweetheart oil contracts, the prosecutors say. Trafigura declined to comment, pointing to a prior statement about the case in which it said it takes the accusations seriously. The case is part of Brazil’s “Car Wash” probe that has revealed stunning political graft at Petrobras, brought down presidents and politicians, and sent scores of businessmen to jail. Now, prosecutors are aiming for their biggest targets yet - multinational firms who have done business with Petrobras in the past two decades. Brazilian prosecutors allege corruption took place on U.S. soil and money was laundered through American and European banks, which could greatly widen the probe. Aside from Trafigura, other powerhouse commodity traders like Vitol SA [VITOLV.UL], Glencore Plc GLEN.L and Mercuria Energy Group are also under investigation. Vitol has said it is cooperating with Brazilian authorities. A Glencore spokesman said the firm takes ethics and compliance seriously, and that it is cooperating with the investigation. Mercuria has denied wrongdoing. Petrobras has suspended oil and fuel trading with Vitol, Glencore and Trafigura. Trafigura’s Brazilian attorneys filed documents before the federal court saying the firm was likely prohibited by the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) from handing over the emails of former executives Mariano Marcondes Ferraz and Marcio Pinto Magalhaes. Both men have been charged for bribing Petrobras officials, which they have denied. According to a court document, Trafigura Limited sent a Dec. 31 letter sent to its Brazilian subsidiary Trafigura do Brasil, in which it wrote that it had been advised by outside counsel that it would have to carry out an extensive examination of its responsibilities under the GDPR in several jurisdictions and also examine what individual country laws state about data privacy. Trafigura questioned the Brazilian judge’s demand that the emails be handed over, writing that “it remains unclear whether the request in respect of Mariano Marcondes Ferraz is indeed within the scope of the decision made by the judicial authority.” It argued in its court filing that it could potentially face a fine of 4 percent of its global revenues - well over $5 billion - if it is found in breach of the EU data laws. Brazilian federal prosecutors declined to comment beyond the Friday court filing demanding the email archives not be destroyed. Prosecutors have accused the European multinationals and some smaller players of collectively paying at least $31 million in bribes over a six-year period to employees at Petrobras, to sell them oil at favorable prices. They have repeatedly said the firms’ top brass had “total and unequivocal” knowledge that they were fleecing Petrobras and that the illicit activity may still be going on. More than 600 pages of legal documents reviewed by Reuters portray what prosecutors describe as a bustling criminal enterprise fueled by competition and greed. Authorities say the trading companies often used freelance middlemen to cover their tracks, allowing them to negotiate deals and pay off Petrobras collaborators using bank accounts in several countries. Earlier this week, the Brazilian court overseeing the investigations against the commodity traders disclosed that one such alleged middleman had been arrested in Miami on the request of the Brazilian judge."

8.06658281071953," Exclusive: Top suspect in Vitol, Glencore Brazil bribery case arrested in U.S. - court SAO PAULO (Reuters) - A Brazilian man facing allegations of bribing officials at state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA PETR4.SA on behalf of Vitol Group [VITOLV.UL], Glencore GLEN.L and other major oil trading firms has been arrested in the United States, authorities said Tuesday. Luiz Eduardo Loureiro Andrade was detained in the United States on Dec. 20, an arrest that was disclosed in a Brazilian court document seen by Reuters. He was arrested with the help of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Besides handling deportation cases, ICE investigates transnational crime. An email included in the court document from a Brazilian federal police official based in Miami indicated that Andrade is being held in an undisclosed location in the United States and that Brazil has requested his extradition. It was not clear when he may be sent back to Brazil. ICE did not respond to requests for comment. An investigator with Brazil’s federal police confirmed the arrest on condition that they not be named as they were not authorized to speak with the press, but declined to provide more details. Andrade was charged in Brazil for acting as a middleman between top executives at Vitol, allegedly funneling bribes to Petrobras officials in exchange for sweetheart deals from the state-run firm. Officials allege that he also carried out the same services for Glencore and other big oil trading firms to win sweetheart contracts with Petrobras. Two former executives of Trafigura [TRAFGF.UL] were charged in the same scheme on Dec. 14. The cases are the latest part of Brazil’s “Car Wash” investigation, launched in 2014 to investigate contracting graft at Petrobras. The probe and resulting trials have toppled scores of powerful business and political figures, including construction industry moguls and former presidents of Brazil and Peru. Brazilian prosecutors have said they will pressure the middlemen charged and arrested to turn state’s witness and testify against powerful executives at the oil trading firms, the same method they have used for years to take down top targets. Prosecutors alleged in their charges against Andrade that Vitol’s head of U.S. operations Mike Loya and its Latin American and Caribbean boss Antonio Maarraoui, had full knowledge of the scheme. Neither Loya nor Maarraoui has been charged. Neither of the executives has replied to repeated requests for comment. Prosecutors said at least $2.85 million in bribes were involved in the cases involving the oil traders, and have called their discoveries so far the “tip of the iceberg.” A Vitol spokeswoman declined to comment on Tuesday, but said the company would always cooperate with investigators. A Glencore spokesman said the firm took ethics and compliance seriously but could not comment further. He added that Glencore would cooperate with Brazilian authorities. The stakes are high for both trading firms. Brazilian prosecutors allege some of the crimes were carried out by Petrobras traders based in Houston and that some illicit funds moved through the U.S. and European banking systems, raising the chance that jurisdiction for investigating the case could widen. Brazilian and U.S. prosecutors have worked closely in the past on Car Wash cases. The probe has already frozen current business for the trading firms in Brazil, an increasingly important global oil producer, but not yet a major source of revenue for the firms. Trafigura said its turnover in Brazil last year was $300 million, a fraction of its overall revenue of $136 billion in 2017. Glencore and Vitol would not provide revenue details, but said Brazil was a minor market. Vitol has a deal pending to purchase a stake in Petrobras’ prized Nigerian oilfields. Petrobras has said there are no indications of wrongdoing in that deal, but it would be up to Brazilian regulators to make the final determination."

TAG, as Petrobras’ gas transportation arm is known, operates about 4,500 kilometers (2,800 miles) of pipelines in the north and northeast of Brazil. “We are very likely to resume talks with Petrobras,” Eduardo Sattamini told newspaper Valor Econômico. Engie submitted the highest bid for TAG, worth more than $7 billion, and was in exclusive contract talks with Petrobras when the Brazilian Supreme Court in July issued an injunction blocking asset sales by the Brazilian state-run oil company. If all judicial hurdles are cleared, France’s Engie and contending bidders will have the opportunity to re-bid for TAG at a yet-to-be defined time, Valor Econômico reported."

The dispute centers around payments relating to operations in the so-called transfer-of-rights area off the coast of Brazil. Such a settlement can only be confirmed after Brazil’s TCU audit court issues an opinion on the matter, Petrobras said, adding both parties have to agree on the terms. “The draft [of the agreement] under analysis by the TCU contemplates one, among the various scenarios discussed between representatives of the government and Petrobras,” the company said in the filing. “This scenario, after the TCU’s opinion [is known] and [after] approval by the parties, may result in a credit in favor of Petrobras amounting to approximately $14 billion,” the filing said. Common shares of Petrobras surged as much as 5.5 percent in afternoon trading on Monday after a local newspaper published details of the potential settlement, which the Economy Ministry subsequently denied."

12.815410665365793," Brazilian government denies to pay $14 billion to Petrobras SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil’s Economy Ministry denied that the government would pay $14 billion to state-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA to settle a dispute over an oil-producing zone off the Brazilian coast known as the transfer-of-rights area. The ministry told Reuters in a statement the figure, reported on Monday by the Valor Economico newspaper, was only one of several proposals passed to the transition team of President Jair Bolsonaro by his predecessor Michel Temer. The final amount has not yet been decided, the ministry said. The report that $14 billion had been agreed to settle the dispute helped boost the common shares of Petrobras, as the company is known, as much as 5.5 percent. Common shares closed Monday 3.3 percent up and preferred rose 1.6 percent, against a 0.15 percent decline in the benchmark Bovespa index. Settling on a figure would be a major step forward in the long-running dispute and help Petrobras cut its sizeable net debt, which stood at $73 billion as of the third quarter. At times during negotiations, Petrobras has claimed that it is owed as much as $30 billion, while parts of the government has said Petrobras owed money to the state. On Wednesday, Mines and Energy Minister Bento Albuquerque said he expected the dispute to be resolved within 100 days, and that Petrobras was the creditor in the dispute. The amount Petrobras was owed and the form of payment was still under discussion, he added. A dispute over the area in question dates back to 2010, when the Brazilian government granted Petrobras the right to extract 5 billion barrels of oil and gas in the offshore Santos Basin. The government received additional shares in Petrobras in return, based on oil prices at the time. The volume of oil in the area is now estimated to be much larger, however, and the cash-strapped government wants to sell the rights to extract the extra oil. The choice reserves cannot be auctioned until the government and Petrobras resolve a dispute over the 2010 transaction. Among other things, the contract stipulated that costs would be reviewed after the area was declared commercially viable in 2014, which has led to years of sparring as oil prices have fluctuated."

Tapped by far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, who took power on Tuesday, Castello Branco had said in a June newspaper column he thought Petrobras - as the company is known - should be privatized, a hardcore proposal even in an administration packed with free market advocates. He has walked back on that idea since being named as CEO in November, saying such a move is not in his mandate, but has indicated he remains laser-focused on an ambitious divestment program, aimed at cutting Petrobras’ staggering net debt, which stood at $73 billion as of the third quarter. Castello Branco has sharply criticized the former government for meddling in domestic diesel pricing. In an interview last year with Reuters, he also complained about courts blocking Petrobras asset sales, which include four refineries and a pipeline subsidiary known as TAG, among many others. His stance has delighted investors, who want the sprawling firm to slim down and consolidate efforts on core businesses, notably exploiting Brazil’s deepwater oilfields. Yet some lawmakers, judges and unions fear Castello Branco will give away some of Brazil’s most prized possessions. They have pledged to get in his way. “It’s the worst situation possible; he’s a fox in the hen-house,” said Eduardo Henrique, a leader of the FNP oil workers union, one of the nation’s largest. “He’s come along to destroy the company ... and confronting that is our big challenge.” Castello Branco, an academic and former board member at Petrobras and iron ore miner Vale SA, is among a coterie of economically conservative officials in the Bolsonaro administration who were trained at the University of Chicago. In Latin America, its pro-free-market graduates - who have at times in recent decades enjoyed significant sway over policymakers - are often referred to as “Chicago Boys.” “It’s interesting that although he is a liberal, he’s going to be head of a state-run company,” said Carlos Langoni, an economist, who advised Castello Branco on his dissertation in the 1970s. “He has been very consistent in his ideas about reducing the role of the state in the economy ... he knows that state-run companies are exceptions.” However, the extent to which Castello Branco will be able to put his liberal ideas into practice is in doubt. Various courts in Brazil have suspended major Petrobras asset sales in recent months. The company is locked in a multi-billion-dollar dispute with the government over an oil producing zone known as the transfer-of-rights area, while the state has effectively required the firm to help front the bill for subsidized diesel purchases since June. Castello Branco, described by many around him as exuding confidence, lacks the political experience of his predecessor Ivan Monteiro, who rose up the ranks of state-run Banco do Brasil SA, deftly maintaining a healthy balance sheet even amid periods of intense government interference. Castello Branco already ruffled feathers at Petrobras in December by setting up an office before taking on his role officially, sources said. He is due to begin formally on Thursday. Brazilian voters have consistently opposed selling off public firms in part or in whole, even as they supported a candidate who promised to dramatically shrink the role of the state in the economy. That could also leave Castello Branco’s agenda vulnerable. “A lot of people who voted for (Bolsonaro) didn’t agree with his ideas,” said Henrique, the union leader. “Next year there will be a big movement to confront the privatizations - specifically with Petrobras.” (Reporting by Gram Slattery Additional reporting by Marta Nogueira, Editing by Rosalba O’Brien)"

10.238439403109535," Exclusive: Petrobras oilfield gets bids from PetroRio, Karoon Energy - sources RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil's PetroRio SA PRIO3.SA and Australia's Karoon Energy Ltd KAR.AX are among the bidders for a mature shallow water oilfield owned by Petroleo Brasileiro SA PETR4.SA, according to two sources speaking on condition of anonymity, as the state-run oil major marches ahead with an ambitious divestment program. With oil production of about 34,000 barrels per day, the Bauna field in Brazil’s Santos Basin is among the largest mature production assets in Petrobras’ $26.9 billion divestment portfolio. While the sources did not disclose a potential value, PetroRio had previously placed a bid of about $500 million for Bauna in 2016 that was ultimately unsuccessful. Oil prices LCOc1CLc1 have increased moderately since then. The slightly more productive Pampo and Enchova clusters in the adjacent Campos Basin, which are being sold together, were seen as fetching bids of around $1 billion in June. Karoon and Petrobras declined to comment. PetroRio did not respond to a request for comment. One of the sources said that other bidders were involved in the auction which closed late last year, and it was possible neither PetroRio nor Karoon would emerge as the winner for the concession set to last through 2040. Petrobras could enter exclusive talks with one of the bidders in a matter of weeks, the sources said. This is the second time PetroRio and Karoon have attempted to purchase Bauna. Karoon had entered into exclusive negotiations in 2016 to purchase Bauna as well as the Tartaruga Verde field, which has recently started producing, though that process was scuttled following a court injunction. Karoon at that time beat out PetroRio’s $500 million bid, which was geared strictly toward Bauna. For PetroRio, the asset fits well with the independent oil firm’s strategy of acquiring stakes in mature oil fields to boost their productivity. For Karoon, which has said that it remains interested in Bauna, the asset would present significant synergies with its nearby Kangaroo and Echidna oil discoveries. Petrobras is cutting its stakes in shallow water and mature fields to refocus its efforts on Brazil’s promising, deepwater pre-salt play. There is some legal uncertainty hanging over the Bauna divestiture. In December, a Supreme Court justice suspended sales of exploration and production assets by Petrobras, but the company later said it believed that decision applied only to processes begun in May or later."
21.25865235751695," UPDATE 1-Brazil's Petrobras adopts hedging program for diesel market (Adds detail through on structure of hedging program, context) SAO PAULO, Dec 28 (Reuters) - Brazil’s Petroleo Brasileiro SA has approved a hedging program for diesel prices in a bid to boost pricing flexibility, the state-run oil firm said in a filing on Friday. While Petrobras, as the firm is known, did not detail how its diesel hedging program would be structured, it said the move was similar to a measure taken in September, when the company introduced a hedging program for gasoline. Under the new measures, which will take effect after a government diesel subsidy program expires at the end of December, Petrobras will be able to keep diesel prices stable for “short periods” of up to seven days, while varying the frequency of price adjustments during times of high volatility. In a separate statement, Petrobras said using the hedging instrument would be neither “automatic nor immediate,” and was geared toward short-term events, such as “hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico”. The company said it was still committed to allowing diesel prices to fluctuate in line with international markets and the exchange rate. Petrobras’ separate gasoline hedging program allows the company to keep domestic gasoline prices stable for up to 15 days at a time. The roll out of the gasoline program, which came after a truckers’ strike over rising diesel prices paralyzed Brazil, was seen as neutral to slightly negative by the market, amid a lack of clarity about the structure of the hedge positions and general fears of interference in market-based pricing policies. In September, Petrobras Chief Financial Officer Rafael Grisolia told Reuters the company was considering adopting a diesel hedge program. He said the cost of the fuel hedge was marginal and that banks that typically executed the fuel hedge included Goldman Sachs, Bank of America Corp, Banco do Brasil SA and Citibank."

38.00244396834132," Brazil's Petrobras suspends new oil exploration or production divestments SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil's state-controlled Petroleo Brasileiro SA PETR4.SA will suspend any new divestment initiatives in oil exploration or production, the company said on Thursday, following a Supreme Court decision. The decision suspended an agreement between Petrobras, as the company is known, and the Brazilian government that helped shield the company from liability as it seeks to dispose of some $27 billion in assets in order to raise cash to pay its debts. The agreement also imposed transparency rules. The divestment program is seen as crucial to the company’s growth in the future, and Petrobras said in a statement that divestment initiatives started before May of this year should not be affected. “Petrobras is studying new ways to continue with its divestment program, in accordance with current legislation while following the limits set by this decision,” the company said in a statement. Petrobras' decision to cancel new divestment programs could also affect some of the companies that operate together with it in different consortia, such as Royal Dutch Shell Plc RDSa.AS, Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N and Norway's Equinor ASA EQNR.OL."
40.3167757884214," Vitol bribery case in Brazil sees 12 charged for graft SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian federal prosecutors on Thursday charged 12 people in connection with an alleged bribery scheme meant to benefit oil trader Vitol Group at the expense of Brazil’s state-led oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro SA. Prosecutors say at least $2.85 million in bribes were involved, but have called their discoveries so far the “tip of the iceberg.” (GRAPHIC: Volumes and revenues of the four oil traders interactive - tmsnrt.rs/2zWgcLA) (GRAPHIC: Volumes and revenues of the four oil traders - tmsnrt.rs/2zSPrI0) Petrobras said in an emailed response to Reuters that it had suspended oil trades with Vitol, along with other massive trading firms Trafigura [TRAFGF.UL] and Glencore, which also face accusations in the same probe. Petrobras said it demanded an explanation from the firms about what actions they are taking to address the allegations lodged by Brazilian investigators. A Vitol spokeswoman declined to comment, but said the company would always cooperate with investigators. A spokesman for Glencore declined to comment, and Trafigura did not immediately reply to requests for comment. Last week, Vitol and Glencore told Reuters they would work with investigators, while Trafigura said it was reviewing the allegations. Trafigura and Vitol said they have zero-tolerance policies for bribery and corruption, while Glencore said it takes ethics and compliance seriously. Those charged on Thursday include former Petrobras employees and middlemen who prosecutors allege worked directly with top executives at Vitol. Brazilian prosecutors last week leveled corruption charges against two former Trafigura executives. In Thursday’s charging document, prosecutors said one of Vitol’s top executives, Mike Loya, head of the firm in the United States, and Antonio Maarraoui, the company’s head for Latin American and the Caribbean, had full knowledge of the scheme. Neither Loya nor Maarraoui was charged on Thursday. Neither of the executives has replied to repeated requests for comment. Brazil’s unprecedented sprawling graft investigations have been built on plea-bargain testimony. Prosecutors told Reuters they will aggressively use the same tactics in this case: charge smaller figures involved and work to reach plea deals with them, seeking testimony against the executives at the foreign firms they allege are involved. The stakes are high for the trading firms. Brazilian prosecutors allege some of the crimes were carried out by Petrobras traders based in Houston and that some illicit funds moved through the U.S. and European banking systems, raising the chance that jurisdiction for investigating the case would widen. Brazilian and U.S. prosecutors have worked closely in the past on Car Wash cases. Loans to the companies could dry up if the corruption allegations stick, according to a senior banking executive at a major global bank who declined to be identified. Since the 2008 financial crisis, big banks have faced increased scrutiny from regulators to crack down on money laundering and other financial crimes. The probe has already frozen their current business in Brazil, an increasingly important global oil producer, but not yet a major source of revenue for the firms. Trafigura said its turnover in Brazil last year was $300 million, a fraction of its overall $136 billion in 2017. Glencore and Vitol would not provide revenue details, but said Brazil was a minor market. Vitol has a deal pending to purchase a stake in Petrobras’ prized Nigerian oilfields. In its statement to Reuters, Petrobras said there were no indications of wrongdoing in that deal, but it would be up to Brazilian regulators to make the final determination. The new developments are also a signal that Brazil’s landmark “Car Wash” probe is far from over. Launched to investigate contracting graft at Petrobras, the probe and resulting trials have toppled scores of powerful business and political figures, including construction industry moguls and former presidents of Brazil and Peru. Foreign oil companies are now in the cross hairs, said prosecutor Athayde Ribeiro Costa, who is heading the latest phase of the probe. Costa told Reuters that any firm that has done business with Petrobras since 2003 would come under intense scrutiny. He added that other major firms have approached Brazilian prosecutors to sound them out about leniency deals. He declined to name the companies."

37.374546508536035," Brazil court ruling casts doubt over Petrobras asset sales RIO DE JANEIRO/BRASILIA (Reuters) - A Brazilian Supreme Court justice on Wednesday suspended a presidential decree establishing rules for Petroleo Brasileiro SA PETR4.SA to sell upstream assets, casting a pall over the state-controlled oil company's ambitious divestiture program. Justice Marco Aurélio Mello granted an injunction in a lawsuit brought by the leftist Workers Party to the Supreme Court, suspending a decree signed by President Michel Temer in April, the justice told Reuters. Part of the asset divestment program of Petrobras, as the company is known, had already been suspended by another Supreme Court justice, Ricardo Lewandowski. The April presidential decree had reinforced an earlier agreement made between Petrobras and Brazil’s federal audit court, known as the TCU. That previous agreement was seen as a major step in allowing asset sales to go forward, after a number of lawsuits by labor unions significantly slowed and in some cases stymied divestitures. While it was not clear what immediate effects Wednesday’s decision would have, it casts doubt over the ongoing sale of Petrobras’ production and exploration assets, said Ali Hage, a partner in the oil and gas area of law firm Veirano Advogados. Petrobras said in its five-year strategy plans released early this month that it foresees around $26.9 billion in asset sales over the next five years to reduce its significant debt load. According to Hage, the Wednesday decision could also present difficulties for oil companies in consortia with Petrobras, by undoing parts of the presidential decree that streamlined procurement in some situations. Among the companies that operate in Petrobras consortia are Royal Dutch Shell Plc RDSa.AS, Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N and Norway's Equinor ASA EQNR.OL. Petrobras did not respond to a request for comment. Brazil-listed preferred shares of Petrobras fell after the decision, but were still up 2.6 percent in afternoon trade, as traders bought back in after two days of losses."

21.515489204006517," Brazil's Ouro Preto cuts bid for Petrobras oilfield clusters: sources SAO PAULO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ouro Preto has cut its bid for two shallow water mature oilfield clusters from Brazil’s state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro, flagging a drop in oil prices in recent months, three sources with knowledge of the matter said. Ouro Preto, a Brazilian energy company backed by private equity giant EIG Global Energy Partners, entered exclusive talks with Petrobras in July after presenting the highest offer for the Pampo and Enchova clusters, located in the Campos basin off the coast of Rio de Janeiro state. At the time, the fields were seen fetching around $1 billion. But the consortium cut its bid for the area, citing a fall in oil prices of around 20 percent since the end of July, on growing U.S. supply and risks of slowing global demand amid economic woes tied to the U.S.-China trade spat. Lower oil prices could hamper efforts by Petrobras, the world’s most-indebted listed oil company, to offload some other assets it intends to sell. It is seeking to raise up to $26.9 billion via asset sales and partnerships by 2023 after falling short of a goal of selling off $21 billion in the 2017-18 period. Reuters could not verify Ouro Preto’s latest bid amount, made after Petrobras last week reopened bidding for the oilfields with rules set by Brazilian audit court TCU. The move cleared the way for other investors to bid under the same contractual terms agreed with the winning consortium. One of the three sources said Petrobras received additional bids on Dec. 7. without disclosing the names of the bidders. Despite the fall in oil prices, the additional bids were still within Petrobras’s target price range for selling the cluster, the person said. A fourth source said that Brazilian oil and gas company Petro Rio SA was considering bidding, but Reuters could not determine whether a bid was ultimately made. Other oilfields, such as Baúna in the Santos Basin, are among the assets the company has put up for sale.

19.464955224084328," Factbox: The trading firms under investigation in Brazil graft probe (Reuters) - Last week, Brazilian investigators accused four of the world’s largest oil-trading firms of participating in a corruption scheme focused on Brazil’s state-controlled oil company Petrobras. Federal prosecutors allege Vitol, Glencore, Trafigura and Mercuria along with several small firms collectively paid at least $31 million in bribes over a six-year period to Petrobras insiders to secure oil deals at advantageous prices. Prosecutors said what they have uncovered so far is the “tip of the iceberg”. The investigation is ongoing and the firms have not been charged. Mercuria denied the allegations. Vitol, Mercuria and Glencore said they would cooperate with the Brazilian investigation while Trafigura said it was reviewing the allegations. Trafigura, Mercuria and Vitol said they have a zero-tolerance policy for bribery and corruption. Glencore said it takes ethics and compliance seriously. Arrest warrants were issued for 11 suspects, eight of whom are in custody. None were current employees of Vitol, Glencore, Trafigura or Mercuria. The four firms move 10 percent of the world’s daily oil consumption and have combined revenues of nearly $630 billion. But despite their size, they are not household names. Here is a look at the companies and some details from last week’s law enforcement action in Brazil. Historically, these companies have kept low profiles, making profits off of transporting commodities like copper, coal and crude oil from the mines and fields to consumers. With a high appetite for risk, they have worked in conflict areas and with controversial governments. As their traded volumes have grown over the last ten years, they have invested globally in strategic pipelines, ports, major fuel station networks, shipping, large oil refineries, mining and even some oilfields. Trafigura and Glencore are both successors to a firm run by the late Marc Rich, the man who invented oil trading. Belgian-born Rich was indicted by U.S. authorities in 1983 on a host of criminal charges including tax evasion, wire fraud and trading with Iran in violation of U.S. sanctions. Rich was pardoned by U.S. President Bill Clinton. Glencore, Switzerland-based and listed in London, bought miner Xstrata in 2013 and is now among the top four biggest listed mining companies. The firm remains the third-biggest oil trader, but its energy business is a small part of its overall portfolio. It also has an agricultural trading business. Along with energy, Trafigura has a major metals and minerals division that accounted for more than half of its gross profits this year. Mercuria has also developed a metals and minerals team and has invested in oil production. London-based Vitol has stayed energy-focused and is the world’s largest independent oil trader at over 7 million barrels per day. Prosecutors alleged that smaller oil trading firms were also involved in the suspected bribery scheme. (GRAPHIC: Volumes and revenues of the four oil traders - tmsnrt.rs/2zWgcLA)"

5.832944591610367," CORRECTED-Brazil’s Petrobras nears terms over TAG pipeline sale (Adjusts Supreme Court designation in first para) NEW YORK, Dec 7 (LPC) - Brazil’s state-controlled oil company Petróleo Brasileiro could present a new sale and purchase agreement (SPA) before the end of December for the sale of the Transportadora Associada de Gás (TAG) pipeline, after a Brazilian Supreme Court injunction in July stalled the sale. The sale of TAG, which operates natural gas pipelines in Brazil’s north and northeast, could fetch Petrobras as much as US$7bn, in one of the company’s largest-ever asset sales, three sources familiar with the process said. A new multibillion dollar syndicated loan is expected to finance the acquisition, two sources said. Petrobras unveiled a five-year investment plan on December 5 which outlined its plans to raise US$26.9bn via asset sales and partnerships and make US$84bn of investments by 2023. The plan is designed to cut Petrobras’ debt of US$88bn which is one of the biggest among oil majors, Reuters reported. Petrobras was aiming to raise US$21bn from asset sales in 2017 and 2018, but the company is expected to fall short by almost US$10bn because of the Supreme Court injunction, the sources said. Selling TAG would see Petrobras scale back from the natural gas distribution business as it prioritizes more profitable investments such as Brazil’s deepwater oil and gas exploration and production segments, while divesting midstream assets such as refineries and pipelines, as well as overseas oil fields. A consortium comprising French electric utility Engie and Canadian pension fund Caisse de dépôt et placement du Québec (CDPQ) were in talks with Petrobras to buy TAG before July’s injunction ordered that Brazil’s Congress had to approve the sale of any state-owned asset. Engie and CDPQ have mandated eight to 10 international banks to raise a loan to back the acquisition of TAG, two sources said. Three Brazilian banks – Banco do Brasil, Bradesco and Itaú BBA, the corporate and investment banking arm of Itaú Unibanco – are understood to be part of the club of mandated banks, the sources said. The banks declined to comment. If the Supreme Court injunction is lifted, the French-Canadian consortium will have to present a new SPA to the market and allow time for counter offers from any other parties interested in buying TAG from Petrobras, the sources said. At least two other consortiums shortlisted by Petrobras in February could present counter-proposals, the sources said. A group comprising EIG Global Energy Partners and the United Arab Emirates’ sovereign wealth fund Mubadala and a second team made up of Australian investment firm Macquarie, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Singaporean sovereign wealth fund GIC previously expressed interest for the TAG pipelines, the sources said. A consortium led by Brazil’s Pátria Investimentos and private equity firm Blackstone also looked at the initial proposal, but rescinded interest earlier this year, according to news reports. Itaú BBA, the investment banking division of Brazil’s Itaú Unibanco, is advising Petrobras on the sale of TAG, according to the sources. The bank declined to comment. Petrobras began moving away from the natural gas distribution business in September 2016 when it sold pipeline operator Nova Transportadora do Sudeste (NTS), which runs natural gas pipelines in Brazil’s south and southeast, to a consortium led by Canadian investor Brookfield Asset Management. Brookfield, along with British Columbia Investment Management Corp, the China Investment Corporation and Singapore’s GIC agreed to pay US$5.2bn for NTS. Petrobras’ decision to sell TAG, which operates a similar business in the north of Brazil, is part of the company’s plan to prioritize exploration and production, which is considered Petrobras’ most important value generating engine. In October, Petrobras agreed to sell its 50% share in oil fields in Nigeria for US$1.53bn to commodities trader Vitol, Africa Oil and Delonex Energy. It also netted approximately US$823m last month when it offloaded stakes in 34 onshore oil fields in Brazil’s Rio Grande do Norte and three shallow water fields in the Campos Basin.

Roberto Castello Branco, named by president-elect Jair Bolsonaro’s economic team to take the helm at Petrobras, is expected to take up the chief executive role next year pending approval by the company’s board. However, the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Castello Branco already had access to internal documents and had taken part in discussions around Petrobras’ new five-year strategic plan, which was made public on Wednesday. He did not make any changes. Brazilian daily O Estado de S.Paulo reported on Thursday that Castello Branco was likely to make changes to the plan once in his new role. The sources told Reuters Castello Branco is also studying moves such as privatizing fuel distribution unit BR Distribuidora SA, a sign he is eager to push ahead with projects welcomed by investors. Castello Branco previously told Estado de S.Paulo in an interview that BR Distribuidora was not a natural fit for the company and did not generate returns, sending its shares soaring on expectations the government’s 70 percent stake could be sold. Some Petrobras employees are irked by Castello Branco’s involvement in company affairs at a time when he does not yet have a formal post, the sources said. However, one of the sources said Castello Branco’s presence in the company did not contravene any governance guidelines. He was learning about Petrobras’ internal mechanisms, talking to staff and preparing for his new role, the source said. “It is the same in Brasilia where they have a (governmental) transition team,” the source said. “He is working on the transition.” A representative for Petrobras declined to comment. Castello Branco did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. Castello Branco recently participated in the firing of an employee associated with Brazil’s leftist Workers’ Party (PT) at the insistence of Bolsonaro’s team, one of the sources said. Bolsonaro has publicly blamed the PT for dizzying levels of corruption at state-run firms such as Petrobras. Contacted by Reuters, Petrobras’ head of security and intelligence, Regina de Luca, confirmed she had been fired but said she was no longer active politically. De Luca had served as secretary for public security under former PT President Dilma Rousseff, who was impeached in 2016 for breaking budget rules. The firing, which shows the tricky political territory that Castello Branco is wading into as he prepares to take the reins at Petrobras, contrasts with the policies of former Petrobras CEO Pedro Parente, who insisted that politics and business should not be mixed at the state-run firm."

10.975064467050574," Brazil antitrust watchdog says looking at wider Petrobras refinery sales SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian antitrust watchdog Cade will begin an investigation on Wednesday that may result in mandatory sales of refineries by state-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA, Cade said in a statement. According to the Cade statement, the watchdog will investigate the influence of Petrobras on fuel prices given that it controls 98 percent of Brazil’s refining capacity. Petrobras earlier this year proposed selling a 60 percent stake in four refineries as part of a wider effort to reduce debt. The company said it would retain about 75 percent of its domestic refining capacity after the privatization. But it stopped the process in July after a decision by the Supreme Court that privatizations must be approved by Congress and after buyers were spooked by a truckers strike in May that forced the company to cut diesel prices. Cade revived the issue on Wednesday, and cited a previous analysis concluded by its technical body, adding that the “partial sale of the assets may not be enough to create independent competitors” and that “the company should sell the assets completely.” The analysis by the technical body said that Petrobras should include in the refineries sale units that are close to each other to reduce distribution costs and increase competition. Petrobras should also sell assets in Brazil’s richest region, the Southeast, the technical body said. The refineries the oil company initially intended to offer to investors were in other regions. In a statement, the oil company said it will prove during the investigation it does not have anticompetitive practices. “Petrobras does not have a monopoly on refining since the 1990s. But more competition in the sector depends on a regulatory framework that attracts new investors.”"
10.975064467050574," World's biggest oil traders paid bribes in Brazil scandal -prosecutors RIO DE JANEIRO/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Leading global oil traders Vitol [VITOLV.UL], Trafigura [TRAFGF.UL] and Glencore paid more than $30 million in bribes to employees at state-owned Brazilian company Petrobras in a scheme that may still be going on, prosecutors said on Wednesday. Top executives of the international companies had “total and unequivocal” knowledge of the graft involving Petroleo Brasileiro SA, known as Petrobras, investigators said at a news conference. The bribes took place between 2011 and 2014, investigators said. The details being made public were just the “tip of the iceberg” investigators said, and the latest revelations were the strongest international links yet announced to the sweeping “Car Wash” probe centered on political corruption at Petrobras. Petrobras employees offered the trading companies lower prices for oil and its derivatives as well as storage tanks in more than 160 separate operations then shared in the savings, authorities said. Those involved, emails obtained by Brazil’s federal police showed, would use nicknames such as Tiger, Flipper or Mr M and discuss below-market prices for oil or tanks, while invoicing their companies at the market rate. The differences could range from 10 cents to a dollar per barrel and the term of art for the bribes was “delta.” Prosecutors also obtained spreadsheets mentioning oil trades involving Vitol, Glencore and Trafigura that they said represent the bribes paid. “Evidence shows that there was a scheme in which the companies investigated paid bribes to Petrobras employees to obtain ... more advantageous prices and sign contracts more frequently,” prosecutors said in a statement. The bribes moved through bank accounts in the United States, Britain, Sweden, Switzerland and Uruguay, among others, raising questions of whether those countries would open investigations. Brazilian police alerted Interpol, seeking the arrest of a Petrobras employee in Houston, whom the company said it has now fired. The employee, Rodrigo Garcia Berkowitz, worked as an oil trader, and prosecutors say he used the nickname Batman. Petrobras said it was cooperating with authorities and viewed itself as a victim of corruption. “We are the most interested party in seeing all the facts come to light,” the company said in a statement. “We will continue adopting all necessary measures to obtain a proper reparation for damages caused (to Petrobras).” Spokesmen for Glencore and Trafigura declined to comment. A Vitol spokesman said the firm “has a zero tolerance policy in respect of bribery and corruption and will always cooperate fully with the relevant authorities in any jurisdiction in which it operates.” More than 130 businessmen and politicians have been convicted in the case in Brazil, including former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who is serving a 12-year prison sentence. ‘STRENGTHEN CREDIBILITY’ The latest developments hit just as Petrobras was hoping to turn the page on corruption. In September, Petrobras settled corruption charges for $850 million with Brazilian and U.S. authorities. Separately on Wednesday it launched a new business plan saying its goal is to “strengthen the credibility, pride and reputation of Petrobras.” The latest Car Wash chapter could undermine Petrobras’ deals and ability to embark on privatization plans that far-right President-elect Jair Bolsonaro’s economic team wants to carry out. Petrobras said a month ago it is selling its 50 percent stake in a Nigerian oil and gas exploration venture to a consortium led by Vitol for $1.53 billion as the state-controlled oil company reduces debt. The deal has not yet closed and it was unclear how Wednesday’s action may affect it. It was not the first time prosecutors have zeroed in on Trafigura, a commodities trader based in Geneva. In March, a former Trafigura executive, Mariano Marcondes Ferraz, was found guilty of bribing a Petrobras executive on behalf of his own company, Decal do Brasil. He was sentenced to more than 10 years in jail. Ferraz was also involved in the scheme unveiled on Wednesday, prosecutors said. Swiss prosecutors also have an open investigation, announced one month after Ferraz’s arrest in Brazil in 2016. The Office of the Attorney General in Switzerland began a criminal probe into an employee of Trafigura as part of a wider investigation into suspected corruption at Petrobras. It did not identify the employee."

10.975064467050574," Petrobras unveils plan to boost asset sales, deepwater investment SAO PAULO/RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA PETR4.SA plans to raise some $26.9 billion via asset sales and partnerships by 2023 while boosting investments on the front edge of an anticipated production boom in Brazil. Petrobras intends to make $84.1 billion in investments from 2019 to 2023, above the $74.5 billion forecast in its 2018 to 2022 plan, it said in a five-year investment program unveiled on Wednesday morning. The firm also moderately cut its oil production forecast, but still forecast production to increase by 10 percent next year, and then 5 percent every year through 2023. Petrobras is trying to stay the course on efforts to reduce one of the heftiest debt loads among oil companies worldwide - $88 billion in gross debt - through divestments and an investment focus on Brazil’s coveted offshore pre-salt area. “The strategic plan came within the expectations of the market, a reasonable increase in oil prices, with important refining divestments and an ambitious leverage target,” said Adriano Pires, a consultant at Brazil’s Center for Infrastructure. In a call with investors, Petrobras Chief Financial Officer Rafael Grisolia said the company expects to attract partners for its refineries in the short term. While the plan appeared to contain no major surprises, it was released just as prosecutors in Brazil alleged that trading giants Vitol [VITOLV.UL], Trafigura [TRAFGF.UL], and Glencore GLEN.L paid over $30 million in bribes to Petrobras employees. The allegations are another black eye for Petrobras, which has been at the center of Brazil’s sprawling “Car Wash” corruption investigations, and the firm is eager to clean up its image. Preferred Brazil-listed shares in Petrobras edged up 0.3 percent in afternoon trade, paring earlier losses, while Brazil's benchmark Bovespa index .BVSP was little changed. Whether or not the company sticks to the plan, Pires added, will depend on the incoming government of right-wing President-elect Jair Bolsonaro. “The challenge of the next government is to maintain this plan,” he said. Bolsonaro, a former lawmaker and military officer, last month named Roberto Castello Branco, a University of Chicago-trained economist, to succeed current Chief Executive Officer Ivan Monteiro, who is set to step down on Jan. 1. While Castello Branco has said he favors selling noncore assets, some of the generals close to Bolsonaro, who see the oil company as a “strategic asset,” may put the brakes on any radical restructuring bid. Petrobras will maintain its focus on deepwater exploration and production, particularly in Brazil’s coveted pre-salt blocks, an offshore area where billions of barrels are locked beneath a thick layer of salt under the ocean. Even so, the company reduced its oil production target to 6 percent in annualized growth from 8 percent in its last plan. “Frankly, I’ve lost count of how many times the production targets have been slashed over the past five-plus years,” said Pavel Molchanov, an energy analyst at Raymond James. The oil company also disclosed its return on invested capital should be above 11 percent in 2020, as it sells assets and cuts debt. Its ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization should fall to 1.5 times by the end of that year, it added, from a goal of 2.5 by the end of 2018."

13.781224972847694," New Petrobras CEO rules out privatization, wants non-core asset sales RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - A University of Chicago-trained economist named on Monday to head Brazil’s Petrobras will not privatize the state-run company, but wants to push ahead with selling non-core assets and to focus on oil exploration and production. Brazil's incoming far-right government announced Roberto Castello Branco as the next chief executive of Petroleo Brasileiro SA PETR4.SA, amid a debate over how far to pursue asset sales at the indebted company, Latin America's largest by market capitalization. Castello Branco’s appointment is the latest in a string of market-friendly selections by President-elect Jair Bolsonaro, many of them influenced by his adviser and future Economy Minister, Paulo Guedes. The appointments have raised hopes among investors that the former army captain, who takes office on Jan. 1, will deliver significant reforms needed to improve Brazil’s creaking public finances, including a pension overhaul. Castello Branco, who in the past has spoken in favor of privatizing Petrobras, on Monday said he had not been tasked with selling off the company but signaled his intention to cut costs, do away with some of the company’s downstream operations and focus on its core business. “The privatization of the company is not in question. I do not have a mandate to think about it,” he told the Folha de S. Paulo newspaper, adding that he expected Brazil’s Supreme Court to approve a path enabling the company to continue selling assets such as majority stakes in two blocks of refineries and in a gas pipeline company. In an earlier interview, with the O Estado de S. Paulo newspaper, he said BR Distribuidora BRDT3.SA, Petrobras' fuel distribution unit, was not a natural fit for the company and does not generate returns, sending its shares up almost 6 percent as investors bet the government may sell its 70 percent stake in the unit. Castello Branco also said he would consider all current asset sales, including that of liquid petroleum gas distribution company Liquigas. “Petrobras’ competence is in oil exploration and production,” he told the newspaper. Guedes has advocated a full privatization of the company while military generals around Bolsonaro oppose such an idea. Underlining that tension, Bolsonaro told reporters on Monday that certain units of Petrobras could be privatized, even though the company is deemed strategic for the nation. Castello Branco, a one-time post-doctoral fellow at the University of Chicago, will join other school alumni in the ranks of the incoming administration, including Guedes and former Finance Minister Joaquim Levy, who has been tapped to lead Brazil’s powerful state development bank, BNDES. Chicago’s economics department has long been known for orthodox economics, particularly in Latin America, and much of Brazil’s business elite is enthused by the prospect of Chicago-linked appointees in top posts in public administration. “We basically have the University of Chicago economics department taking over the Brazilian economy,” said James Gulbrandsen, chief investment officer for Latin American investments at NCH Capital, welcoming Castello Branco’s appointment. “He’s been public in the past about advocating for less government intervention ... all the way to privatizing parts of Petrobras.” Castello Branco, a member of Petrobras's board until 2016, has also held executive positions at Brazil's central bank and at iron ore miner Vale SA VALE3.SA. “We expect Petrobras’ deleveraging process and divestment program to continue under Castello Branco’s tenure,” Vincente Falanga and Oscar Camilo, analysts at Banco Bradesco BBI, wrote in a note to clients. Petrobras, which is burdened by some $88 billion of gross debt, has played a leading role in developing a bonanza of deep-water oil finds in recent decades. Castello Branco told Folha that the company would now double-down on that strategy, seeking to maximize potential of the so-called pre-salt deep-water area. “We need to seize this wealth while there is time. In some decades, oil will lose the relevance it has today,” he said. Petrobras is a source of national pride for many Brazilians, but its central role in Brazil’s “Car Wash” investigation, considered by many to be the world’s largest corruption probe, has hurt its public image and bottom line in recent years. Preferred shares of Petrobras rose 0.8 percent after experiencing swings during the day, while Brazil's benchmark Bovespa index .BVSP fell 0.7 percent. Bolsonaro on Monday said that Petrobras’ outgoing boss, Ivan Monteiro, could go to state-run Banco do Brasil, the country’s largest, although no decision has been made. Petrobras said Monteiro would leave his post on Jan. 1."

13.366251412394082," Technocrat with a deft touch, Petrobras' placeholder CEO may cling on RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil’s right-wing President-elect Jair Bolsonaro has thrilled investors with pledges to transform the state’s role in Latin America’s largest country. But when it comes to state-run oil firm Petroleo Brasileiro SA, or Petrobras, the radical new approach could start with the new president doing nothing at all. In recent days, Bolsonaro’s team has said Petrobras Chief Executive Ivan Monteiro may stay on — a novelty at a firm with some 37 CEOs in its 65-year history. That in turn is drawing attention to Monteiro, the unassuming native of isolated Amazonas state who took over the helm after his predecessor resigned suddenly in June. Many had seen Monteiro as a placeholder in the final days of lame-duck President Michel Temer’s time in office, which ends Jan. 1. Investors, analysts and company insiders told Reuters that Monteiro, previously chief financial officer at Petrobras, has a knack for both navigating Brazil’s tricky politics and nursing weakened balance sheets back to health. That combination, honed over decades at state lender Banco do Brasil SA, may prove crucial at Petrobras, whose finances have often suffered as governments used it as a tool for political and policy objectives. Monteiro’s predecessor, the turnaround specialist Pedro Parente, drew a red line on political meddling at Petrobras during his tenure and eventually quit when the government crossed it. In contrast, Monteiro’s colleagues say he can work deftly within the system. “He knows the financial market well, and he also knows Brasilia,” said a high-ranking Petrobras executive, who requested anonymity to speak frankly. “In addition to being great technically, he has a good rapport with the government,” added the executive. “That, I think, makes an excellent profile for the head of Petrobras.” Perhaps as importantly, analysts and investors say, Monteiro has played a central role in Petrobras’ efforts to reduce its $88 billion debt load, which has crimped its ability to invest in Brazil’s vast new offshore oil finds. Monteiro knows the intricacies of an ambitious asset sale program and contentious talks with the government over the so-called ‘transfer-of-rights’ area, which, if resolved, could bring the company a huge financial windfall. “He’s involved in all the divestments, he’s involved in transfer-of-rights,” said Luiz Carvalho, lead Latin America analyst for oil and gas, petrochemicals and agribusiness at UBS. “So at the end of the day, the continuity of Ivan Monteiro would be a positive.” Earlier this month, Monteiro said he had not yet been approached by members of Bolsonaro’s team about staying on. His representatives have not made him available for an interview. Petrobras, Brazil’s largest company by market capitalization, employs over 60,000 people, and is a source of national pride. Yet its central role in the “Car Wash” investigation, considered by many to be the world’s largest corruption probe, has hurt both its public image and bottom line in recent years. Monteiro’s ability to read the winds in Brasilia may be tested by dramatic cross-currents in the administration of Bolsonaro, who won the presidency in a run-off election last month. The man who will be economy minister under Bolsonaro, Paulo Guedes, has defended a full privatization of the oil company, while military generals around Bolsonaro oppose such an idea. Bolsonaro himself has said he favors keeping the company in state hands but is open to privatizing certain assets. Early in November, Bolsonaro said Monteiro would likely be replaced when the new government takes over, as part of the customary changing of the guard at state-run firms. But soon after, Vice President-elect Hamilton Mourao singled out Monteiro in a message on Twitter, saying he was “very much impressed” after meeting with Petrobras executives. This week, Mourao said Monteiro and others at Petrobras may stay on. A native of Manaus, a state capital at the heart of the Amazon rainforest, Monteiro worked at Banco do Brasil for decades, rising to the role of CFO from 2009 to 2015. That was a period when leftist President Dilma Rousseff put intense pressure on state banks to boost credit and lower interest rates. While state mortgage lender Caixa Economica Federal is still recovering from an overstretched balance sheet, Banco do Brasil managed to stay on steady ground and even improve some measures of profitability. Those close to Monteiro say that was due to his disciplined cost controls and a talent for complying with the letter of government orders while finding workarounds in spirit. “If it weren’t for him, Banco do Brasil would have turned into Caixa,” a banking executive told Reuters in 2015. When Monteiro arrived at Petrobras that year as its new CFO, some in the market were skeptical, said Carvalho of UBS. In part, that was because his move coincided with that of Aldemir Bendine, then-CEO of Banco do Brasil, who took the top job at the oil firm. A loyalist to Rousseff, who was impeached and removed from office in 2016 for breaking budget rules, Bendine was convicted this year on corruption charges and is serving an 11-year prison sentence. However, Carvalho said Monteiro won over skeptics with deft execution of plans to cut debt and rein in operating costs. Since 2015, net debt at Petrobras has been slashed by some $27 billion, while Brazil-listed preferred shares have climbed 360 percent since the beginning of 2016. Three people around Monteiro described him as “technically minded” - but far from a pushover. “When it’s a subject that he understands well, Ivan doesn’t like to hear the word ‘No’,” said the Petrobras executive, who requested anonymity. “But, in general, he’s one to talk with the team quite a bit while making decisions.”"

18.090259023663354," Petrobras could get about $7.9 billion from contract revision: source BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA could receive some 30 billion reais ($7.9 billion) from the government in a renegotiation of the “transfer of rights” oil contract, a person following the process told Reuters on Wednesday. The money to pay state-controlled Petrobras, as the company is known, would come from a potential auction of excess oil from the “transfer of rights” area off the Brazilian coast, according to the source, part of the team working on the transition to a new government in Brazil. The person, who requested anonymity, said such an auction could raise 120 billion to 130 billion reais next year, if the necessary legislation clears Congress. American depositary receipts for Petrobras shares added to gains on the news, rising 2.5 percent in New York. Brazil’s Senate has fast-tracked a bill that would open the way for the auction and possibly for the payment to Petrobras. A dispute over the oil in question dates back to 2010, when the Brazilian government granted Petrobras the right to extract 5 billion barrels of oil and gas in the offshore Santos Basin. The government received additional shares in Petrobras in return, based on oil prices at the time. But volume of oil is now estimated to be much larger, and the cash-strapped government wants to sell the rights to extract the extra oil in the area. The choice reserves cannot be auctioned until the government and Petrobras resolve a dispute over the 2010 transaction.

2.7925582768551487," UPDATE 2-Petrobras earnings miss forecasts on spending surge, shares fall (Adds analyst comment, market reaction) RIO DE JANEIRO, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Brazil’s Petroleo Brasileiro SA on Tuesday reported a surge in third-quarter net profit that still lagged forecasts as oil prices rose but spending at the state-owned company jumped. Petrobras made a net profit of 6.644 billion reais ($1.78 billion), well above the 266 million reais it posted a year earlier, but shy of a $1.98 billion average Refinitiv IBES estimate. Analysts were particularly concerned by a 50 percent cut in free cash flow to 8.115 billion reais from the prior quarter, as Petrobras boosted capital spending and made a second payment as part of the settlement of a class action lawsuit over graft in January. “We have a negative view,” Goldman Sachs said in a client note. The lower free cash flow “mainly reflects the pick-up in capex in order to revert the negative trend in production,” it said. Petrobras shares fell 2.6 percent to 27.4 reais per share in midday trading. Petrobras oil output slid in September by 13 percent compared with the same period last year while the results report on Tuesday showed investment rose to 15.441 billion reais from 10.434 billion reais in the same period last year. Petrobras said its growing share of the domestic diesel market provided an earnings boost, as a diesel subsidy program put in place in June to resolve a truckers’ strike over rising fuel costs hit the company’s competitors. But analysts at XP Investimentos said increased spending by Petrobras on importing diesel fuel contributed to the company’s earnings miss. Petrobras said it received 1.6 billion reais from the government as part of the second phase of the subsidy program, which is set to end in December. It was also hit by the payment of a $853.2 million fine to settle charges by U.S authorities that former executives and directors of the company broke U.S. anti-corruption laws. That deal, coupled with the $2.95 billion settlement of a class action suit by U.S. investors, was a big in removing legal uncertainty from the so-called Car Wash investigation into a graft scheme that cost the state-run company billions of dollars. Net debt at the world’s most indebted listed oil company rose slightly to 291.834 billion reais ($78.30 billion) from 284.027 billion reais in the second quarter. It managed to lower its net debt to an EBITDA ratio to 2.96 from 3.23 in the second quarter, as it seeks to reach 2.5 by year-end. Efforts to sell off $21 billion in assets in the 2017-2018 period have been hampered by legal hurdles and union resistance, but it could offload another $20 billion through 2019, a source told Reuters last month. On Tuesday, executives acknowledged the goal would not be achieved, due to the halted sales of the TAG gas pipeline network and refineries. Chief Executive Officer Ivan Monteiro said he had not been approached by the team of far-right president-elect Jair Bolsonaro, who will take office in January and is expected to choose another leader for the company. Petrobras said sales revenue grew to 98.26 billion reais, up from 71.822 billion in the same period last year.

The other 50 percent stake in Petrobras Oil and Gas BV, also known as Petrobras Africa, is owned by Brazilian investment bank BTG Pactual, which in a Wednesday filing confirmed a Reuters report that it would likely hang on to its portion after previously mulling a sale. Petrobras, one of the world’s most indebted oil majors, had targeted $21 billion in asset sales for 2017 and 2018, but only succeeded in unloading $9.5 billion worth by the end of the first half. The deal involves a stake in some of two deepwater exploration blocks that are among Nigeria’s largest and lowest-cost fields. Swiss-based Vitol is expected to shoulder the largest part of the investment, spending an estimated $1 billion, according to a Reuters report in June about the oil trader’s interest.. Vancouver-based Africa Oil Corp and Delonex Energy, an Africa-focused oil company, are members of the consortium. Petrobras earlier this year sold a 25 percent stake in Roncador, one of Brazil’s largest oil fields, to Norway’s Equinor ASA for about $2 billion. It is also in talks to sell its TAG gas pipeline unit, probably to a group led by France´s Engie SA, for more than $7 billion, although the process has been halted by a Brazilian Supreme Court injunction.

0.8839320366289332," Petrobras stops Chevron plan to drill in Brazil offshore block: sources RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - A decision by Petrobras not to invest in drilling new wells has derailed Chevron Corp’s plan to resume exploration in a Brazilian offshore field, people familiar with the matter said. Chevron, which operates the field with a 52 percent stake, approved the drilling plan but Petrobras, which holds a 30 percent stake nixed the move, according to two people close to the talks. Brazil’s state-controlled oil company, officially known as Petroleo Brasileiro, is prioritizing development of pre-salt offshore resources where billions of barrels of oil lie under a thick layer of salt below the ocean floor, the two people said. The Frade field is post salt and has less oil than pre-salt fields. Petrobras and Schlumberger NV, which planned to drill six wells for some $20 million, could not immediately be reached for comment. Chevron declined to comment. Brazilian energy company Petro Rio SA said on Monday it bought the remaining 12 percent from Frade Japao. Petro Rio SA CEO Nelson Queiroz told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday the company would be interested in buying Petrobras’ stake. “We see extending the life of the field as a positive, drilling new wells,” he said. Chevron and Petrobras halted exploration in the Frade field after a 2011 spill that led to criminal charges and a civil lawsuit. Petrobras, one of the world’s most indebted oil companies, has slashed outlays and focused its shrunken capital expenditure budget on developing stakes in the world class pre-salt play in Latin America’s top producer. Other oil majors are also spending top dollar to lock in stakes to the area to replenish shrunken reserves amid rising oil prices."
-1.9383446931630373," Exclusive: Petrobras could divest another $20 billion in assets through 2019 - source RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil's Petroleo Brasileiro SA PETR4.SA could sell an additional $20 billion in assets through next year, a person with knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Tuesday, indicating that the state-run oil company expects to maintain its robust pace of divestments despite recent setbacks. Planned sales of its Pasadena refinery in Texas and two oilfield clusters in the Campos basin could be inked by year end, the source said, declining to be named given the sensitivity of the topics. Petrobras did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Petrobras, the world’s most indebted listed oil company, has been seeking to sell assets to reduce its debt load, despite resistance from unions and courts. From 2016 to the present, it has divested some $20 billion. But as of June 2018, it had completed just $9.5 billion of the $21 billion in divestments it had targeted for 2017 and 2018. It has not released an asset sales forecast for 2019. Petrobras could conclude the sale of its Pasadena refinery in Texas to Chevron CVX.N by the end of 2018, though it will not recover its more than $1 billion investment, the source said. Reuters reported last week that Petrobras was in talks to sell the refinery to Chevron. Chevron declined to comment. A plan, valued at around $1 billion, to sell Pampo and Enchova, two shallow-water mature oilfield clusters located in Brazil’s Campos basin, is also expected to be signed this year, said the source and another person familiar with the matter. Reuters reported in July that Petrobras had entered exclusive talks to sell the area to Brazilian energy firm Ouro Preto Oleo e Gas, which is backed by private equity firm EIG Global Energy Partners. EIG could not immediately be reached for comment. Ouro Preto declined to comment. Petrobras will not achieve the $21 billion 2017-2018 divestment goal without the sale of its TAG pipeline unit, valued at around $7 billion. The TAG sales process, which had been in its final stages, is likely to remain frozen for the time being after a court decision earlier this year requiring sales of units of state companies to get congressional approval. Brazilian President-elect Jair Bolsonaro, who takes power in January, has said he generally favors allowing Petrobras to sell assets, while opposing a full privatization. New Brazilian presidents typically replace senior management at Petrobras and other state-owned companies, and the pace of divestments could shift under new leadership. Petrobras has also been seeking creative ways to boost output from its aging oil fields, selling a 25 percent stake in its prolific Roncador field in the Campos Basin to Norway's Equinor EQNR.OL earlier this year. In the same vein, the company also sought bids in May from oil services firms Schlumberger SLB.N, General Electric Co's unit Baker Hughes BHGE.N and Halliburton HAL.N for a production sharing agreement for an onshore field in the Potiguar basin. That would mark the first such deal between oil services companies and Petrobras, with the firms competing by offering to boost output most from the aging Canto do Amaro field. But a deal is not likely until the first quarter of 2019, the source said. Another person familiar with the matter said an agreement this year was possible but more likely for next year. Baker Hughes, Halliburton and Schlumberger declined to comment. Despite the setbacks, Petrobras, which reports quarterly results next week, is likely to reach its goal of cutting net debt to 2.5 times earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) by year-end, the person with knowledge of the matter said, down from 3.23 times at the end of June."

0.1813469120946421," Brazil presidential frontrunner's advisers clash over Petrobras RIO DE JANEIRO/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Nationalistic and free market advisers to Brazil’s right-wing presidential frontrunner are deeply split about the future of state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro, foreshadowing a showdown over divestments and fuel subsidies. University of Chicago-educated banker Paulo Guedes, economic adviser to frontrunner Jair Bolsonaro, has said he favors full privatization of Petrobras. Failing that, investors hope he can promote a business-friendly agenda such as asset sales to reduce the company’s $74 billion net debt. Federal prosecutors in Brazil said on Wednesday that Guedes was being investigated over accusations of fraud tied to the pension funds of state-run companies, and Bolsonaro has rejected one of his policy recommendations. Meanwhile, an increasingly vocal cadre of military generals stressing the importance of maintaining Petrobras as a strategic asset have shown growing influence. Bolsonaro himself was an early supporter of a truckers’ strike this year over rising diesel prices. The government ultimately ended the strike by meddling in Petrobras’ ability to set prices at the pump, another policy that investors would like to see the government end. Petrobras shares spiked 10 percent on Monday as investors bet a Bolsonaro administration would mostly give the company free rein in terms of selling off units to cut debt or setting fuel prices according to market forces. The former army captain’s surge in the polls, topped by his win in the first round of voting, sparked a rally that has added $18 billion to the state oil company’s market value this month. But tensions between the two wings of Bolsonaro’s campaign threaten to cut the euphoria short. One senior member of Bolsonaro’s entourage, who declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issues, said he had called for Petrobras to be broken into four companies and for three to be sold off. “Now the final word on all this will rest with Bolsonaro,” he said. “I don’t think he really wants to.” Bolsonaro voted as a legislator to preserve the state oil company’s monopoly on exploration and production and as a candidate he has taken a wide range of stances. Mirroring the views of some of the generals close to him, he has described Petrobras as a strategic asset. “I believe we need to keep the core of Petrobras,” he said in an interview with TV station Band on Wednesday night. “The question of refining, refineries, I think that you can move gradually toward privatizations.” In another recent interview he said he opposed privatizing Petrobras but still could reluctantly move to end the oil company’s “monopoly” in Brazil that he said gave it excessive pricing power. Some 49.6 percent of Petrobras’ stock is traded on the stock exchange. A key adviser on infrastructure and energy issues, General Oswaldo de Jesus Ferreira, has described the company as a strategic asset that must stay in state hands. “Given Jair Bolsonaro’s history of voting in his nearly 30-years in congress, his connection with statist military sectors and the contradictory statements of his campaign leaders on the subject, it is hard to believe that he will include Petrobras in a program of privatizations,” said Ricardo Lacerda, chief executive at investment bank BR Partners. “The market seems overly optimistic about this issue.” Fuel subsidies are another flashpoint. In May, Bolsonaro reacted to the strike by truckers angry about rising diesel prices. He enthusiastically backed the strike, tweeting that the movement showed “how the people are robbed for the benefit of a political caste, which for decades has enslaved everyone.” The strike brought Brazil’s economy to a standstill. To mollify the truckers, President Michel Temer’s government dismantled a free-market fuel pricing policy and reintroduced fuel subsidies. This prompted Petrobras’ market friendly CEO Pedro Parente to quit, and its share price tumbled. Oil prices have risen further since May, but subsidies are due to expire in December. Whether to maintain the subsidies could present the first test of Bolsonaro’s free market inclinations, if he wins the election and is inaugurated on Jan. 1. Bolsonaro’s platform, written by Guedes, among others, states that Petrobras should be able to follow international pricing but ease short-term volatility with hedges. Yet the candidate has declined to say definitively whether he would extend the diesel subsidy. It is hard to know how a potential Bolsonaro government would handle issues like the truckers strike, said Edmar Almeida, an energy professor at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. “Lots of contradictions still exist between Paulo Guedes’ neo-liberal vision and the military’s nationalist vision.” Investors may be more realistic to hope for sales of Petrobras assets to relieve its hefty debt load, which Moody’s Investors Service has said represents one-third of all Latin America’s rated corporate debt. Bolsonaro’s party platform says the company should be able to sell substantial stakes in refining, wholesale, transport and other areas where it has market power. Currently, a Supreme Court injunction triggered by a union lawsuit has halted sales of subsidiaries like its $7 billion TAG pipeline. Some observers fear Guedes’ influence is on the wane. His uneasy alliance with Bolsonaro appeared to fray last month when Guedes proposed reviving an unpopular financial transactions tax known as the CPMF to raise government revenue. That idea was swiftly shot down by Bolsonaro and the once loquacious Guedes has barely been heard from since. Still, Bolsonaro confirmed on Thursday that he would name Guedes to oversee a “super ministry” combining the current finance, planning and development portfolios. Despite the tug of war between his advisers, Bolsonaro’s energy policies are more investor friendly than those of Workers Party standard-bearer Fernando Haddad, who will take him on in the second round on Oct. 28. Haddad’s oil policy guru is former Petrobras CEO Sergio Gabrielli, whom many see as having presided over an era of corruption and mismanagement at the company. “For now, what Petrobras’ share price reflects is simply a company which could remain free of the kind of intervention which the PT once promoted,” said Marcio Correia, who manages 14 billion reais in equities at JGP Asset Management in Rio de Janeiro. “But Petrobras shares could still appreciate more depending on what a potential Bolsonaro government does.”"
3.105474232653577," Exclusive: Brazil's Bolsonaro would not sell Petrobras in short term - party chief RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - The far-right front-runner in Brazil's presidential election, Jair Bolsonaro, has no plans to privatize oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA PETR4.SA in the short term if elected, the president of his party told Reuters on Wednesday. Gustavo Bebianno said the sale of Petrobras, Brazil’s largest corporation, could still be considered in the medium term, but only after the company had been fully “revitalized” by changing its management. He said that would require the removal of political appointees made by the Workers Party (PT), the Brazilian Democratic Movement (MDB) party and other political groups, some of whom have been accused of siphoning off billions of dollars in kickbacks and bribes through overpriced contacts with construction firms. “You cannot mess with Petrobras because it is a public asset and has to be treated as such,” Bebianno said. “The company needs to be revitalized, we have to remove the people of the PT and of the MDB from there and then maybe we can think of privatization further along,” he said. Bolsonaro, an extreme-right congressman favored by financial markets, fell just short of an outright majority in Sunday’s election. He will face leftist Fernando Haddad, a former Sao Paulo mayor, in a second-round ballot on Oct. 28. His chief economic adviser Paulo Guedes, a Chicago University-trained free-market economist, has advocated selling all state companies to help reduce Brazil’s wide budget deficit. That would include Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras SA ELET6.SA, known as Eletrobras, Brazil's largest utility. However, Bolsonaro said this week that he was unwilling to sell energy generation assets, suggesting he was against a full privatization of the sprawling power company. Bolsonaro, who is backed by a group of nationalist retired army generals, has also said he considers Petrobras a strategic asset that the state should retain. Federal prosecutors said on Wednesday that Guedes is under a federal investigation for alleged fraud, tied to the pension funds of major state-run companies. That could complicate Bolsonaro’s choice of Guedes as finance minister since he is running on a law-and-order anti-corruption platform. Bebianno said Guedes continued firmly in position as Bolsonaro’s economic guru despite the fraud probe. Brazil's markets, which had rallied as Bolsonaro's candidacy gained strength, retreated on the news of the Guedes probe.

Petrobras’ 2019-2023 business plan, set to be released in December, should include a resumption of platform construction thanks to the company’s improving finances, Petrobras’ director for production and technology development Hugo Repsold said. “We will build platforms independently of who is president,” Repsold told Reuters on Wednesday night, on the sidelines of an oil event in Rio de Janeiro. “We weren’t building platforms because we were poor. When you’re poor, you take a taxi, you take an Uber, but you don’t buy a car. Now Petrobras is getting more financially healthy and it will begin making platforms,” he said, adding that all platforms needed through 2022 have already been contracted out. The move would mark a departure from recent practice by the world’s most indebted oil company of leasing platforms from companies like SBM offshore or BW Offshore.

6.62679839009119," Brazil's Petrobras cuts gasoline refinery price after pump record SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil’s state-owned oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA said on Monday that it would cut the average price of gasoline at its refineries by 0.59 percent after pump prices hit record levels in the country last week. Petrobras, as the company is known, said the price reduction to 2.2381 reais ($0.5476) per liter will go into effect on Tuesday. That’s a decline from the previous fixing of 2.2514 reais per liter, the highest refinery price since Petrobras began nearly daily price adjustments last year. Gasoline prices at the pump hit an average price of 4.652 reais per liter last week, a record when not accounting for inflation, according to a survey conducted by industry regulator ANP. Petrobras’ move to cut its refinery rate is at odds with global oil prices, which rose more than 3 percent on Monday to four-year highs after Saudi Arabia and Russia said they would not immediately act to increase production, despite appeals from U.S. President Donald Trump. Earlier this month, Petrobras unveiled a program that would allow it to hedge against gasoline price moves, allowing it to reduce volatility in refinery fuel prices. The mechanism will permit Petrobras to maintain prices at a set level for up to 15 days without incurring losses, reducing the frequency of adjustments, according to the company.

The district court in Rotterdam said a preliminary hearing of the case against Petrobras, as the company is known, will be held on Dec. 18. It will look into demands by shareholders for compensation for losses due to a long-running corruption scandal at the company, which has numerous subsidiaries headquartered in the Netherlands. Shareholders, united in the Stichting Petrobras Compensation Foundation (SPCF), claim to have been misled by Petrobras as the company covered up widespread fraud for years, while issuing shares and bonds on the basis of false information. Petrobras said in a regulatory filing it denies all the allegations made in the Dutch case and will continue to defend its interests. The decision of the Dutch court to hear the case comes after Petrobras reached a $3 billion settlement with U.S. investors over corruption at the company.

Documents released by the Rotterdam court on Wednesday did not specify the amount of compensation shareholders are demanding from the world’s most indebted oil company.

15.219966953490244," UPDATE 2-Brazil diesel subsidy program threatens Petrobras, market -FCStone (Adds approval of payment to Petrobras) RIO DE JANEIRO, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Brazil could face a diesel shortage at the end of 2018 as a result of the government’s mispriced subsidy program which has discouraged suppliers, and the state-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA may be forced to sell diesel at a loss, broker INTL FCStone said on Tuesday. Brazil’s oil industry regulator ANP said it approved the payment of 871.5 million reais to Petrobras on Tuesday to compensate for the diesel subsidy. Petrobras Chief Financial Officer Rafael Grisolia had earlier told Reuters on Friday that the firm expected to receive 2 billion reais to 2.5 billion reais ($484 million to $605 million) from ANP within two weeks to make up for subsidies. Earlier this year, a nationwide truckers’ protest over rising diesel prices paralyzed Latin America’s largest economy and forced the government to lower diesel prices through tax cuts and subsidies. But the subsidy program announced in May has set prices too low to compensate most diesel importers, FCStone said in a statement. Companies have stopped selling the fuel, forcing Petrobras to supply most of the market at a loss and raising the specter of a shortage in the coming months, the commodity broker added. “Private imports are paralyzed, and Petrobras is practically the only agent bringing the product to Brazil,” FCStone said. “Unless oil regulator ANP raises diesel prices and starts paying subsidies, we will have diesel shortages in the last months of the year or Petrobras will have to face the cost alone of supplying the whole market at a loss,” FCStone said. The subsidy plan ended the truckers’ strike but it raised the specter of a new and costly round of state meddling in the affairs of Petrobras, still the world’s most indebted oil company. Brazil will need to import some 5.5 million cubic meters of diesel in the last four months of the year, a 12 percent increase over the same period last year, FCStone said. The growing need comes after an explosion in August at Replan, Petrobras’ largest refinery, hurt output and as a thriving agriculture industry drives demand higher."

In June, Reuters reported that a consortium led by top oil trader Vitol had entered exclusive talks to acquire PetroAfrica, as the company is known, in a bid estimated to be worth up to $2.5 billion. State-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA , which owns 50 percent of the venture, would be the lead seller in such a deal but BTG’s 40 percent stake and Helios Investment Partners’ 10 percent would also be candidates for sale. If PetroAfrica were sold at Vitol’s proposed price, BTG would have to book a loss, however, as the bank paid $1.5 billion for its initial 50 percent stake acquired in 2013, according to the source, who could not speak for attribution because the discussions are private. Although BTG had previously decided in favor of selling the stake, the bank now believes that PetroAfrica, which participates in two deepwater oil exploration blocks off the coast of Nigeria, will start to generate a stable cash flow bringing regular dividends to the bank soon. BTG would still be willing to sell if Vitol were to raise its bid, the source added. BTG, Vitol and PetroAfrica did not immediately comment on the matter. PetroAfrica is one of the last remaining stakes BTG Pactual owns in individual companies. After its founder Andre Esteves was arrested in late 2015 on corruption charges, the bank was forced to shed assets and BTG partners decided to divest illiquid stakes. A Brazilian federal judge acquitted Esteves in July. Earlier on Friday, newspaper Valor Econômico reported that BTG intended to keep its stake in PetroAfrica, but that no decision had yet been made.

Between 2010 and 2014, former administrations of Haddad’s Workers Party (PT) forced Petrobras, as the firm is commonly known, to keep its fuel prices down as part of a bid to control inflation, which drained the world’s most indebted oil company of billions of dollars as oil prices climbed. But Haddad said on Thursday that Petrobras should not be used as a tool to combat inflation, although it should also not be given complete autonomy. “I’m against using Petrobras to combat inflation. Petrobras is a company, it has shareholders,” said Haddad, speaking to a group of foreign correspondents. Haddad recently replaced former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who cannot legally run due to a corruption conviction, as the PT’s official candidate. Although his support is likely to rise with Lula’s backing, Haddad was in fifth place in a major opinion poll released on Tuesday, with 8 percent of the vote. If no candidate wins a majority in an Oct. 7 first-round vote, as is likely, the top two vote getters will advance to a runoff.

Itau BBA analysts said there is uncertainty around “how the strategy will be employed”, as the structure of hedge positions while prices are frozen is unknown. Gabriel Francisco, analyst at XP Investimentos, said the hedging policy is negative, as “it may be interpreted as a setback to a market-based pricing policy”. The move comes after a truckers’ strike over rising diesel prices paralyzed Latin America’s largest economy in May and forced unpopular President Michel Temer to cut diesel costs through a mix of tax breaks and subsidies. The tumult prompted Petrobras’s chief executive officer to resign and raised fears of government meddling in pricing, which has cost Petrobras billions of dollars in the past. Petrobras has not yet been compensated for the subsidies that took effect in June. In the meanwhile, there has been speculation over whether the company will face pressure to lower gasoline prices, which have climbed internationally as oil prices have gained ground.

Marsaioli said Petrobras intends to reopen the Paulinia refinery, known as Replan, at half-capacity given the fire early on Monday that affected part of the facility. The unaffected part may go back into production a week after procedures for reopening are completed, Marsaioli said. Petrobras did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Replan accounts for about 20 percent of Petrobras’ refining capacity, processing the equivalent of 434,000 barrels of oil per day, according to the company’s website. A Petrobras executive said the incident was serious but that the company had enough stocks to cover Replan halting operations for 15 days.

29.034002974434834," Petrobras profit buoyed by oil price surge, Brazilian fuel subsidies RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil’s Petroleo Brasileiro SA reported a larger-than-expected jump in quarterly net profit, helped by rising oil prices and diesel subsidies that allowed it to boost its market share, the state-controlled oil company said on Friday. Petrobras, as the company is known, posted a net profit of 10.072 billion reais ($2.69 billion) in the second quarter, soaring from a profit of 360 million reais in the same period a year earlier, when it was hit by a one-time tax-related charge. The company had been expected to earn $1.505 billion in the second quarter of 2018, according to analysts’ estimates. Petrobras shares gained more than 5 percent, advancing to their highest level since May 23 when its former chief executive officer, Pedro Parente, voluntarily cut diesel prices in a bid to defuse a nationwide truckers’ protest over rising fuel costs that paralyzed Latin America’s top economy. The truckers stayed off the job until President Michel Temer’s government agreed to sweeping moves to cut diesel prices through tax reductions and subsidies for Petrobras and other fuel vendors. That sparked fears of renewed political meddling at the state-run company and helped drive Parente to resign. The government-imposed diesel subsidy plan so far has hurt Petrobras competitors that rely on fuel imports more than the state-controlled company, which can refine its own domestically drilled oil. Petrobras boosted its diesel market share to 87 percent in June from 77 percent in March. Utilization rates at Petrobras refineries also rose to 81 percent in June from 72 percent in March. “Companies joined the subsidy program and what happened was a big reduction in the volume of (diesel) imports and a small increase in Petrobras’ market share, but I think that is going back to normal,” Petrobras CEO Ivan Monteiro said on Friday. Monteiro, formerly the company’s chief financial officer, expressed confidence that Petrobras would be reimbursed for the price controls, describing the government’s delay in providing compensation as “natural.” The second-quarter results show the company expects to receive 590 million reais. XP Investimentos analyst Gabriel Francisco said the results were positive and praised the company’s cash generation in the second quarter but noted that “not all of its revenues booked came in as cash flow, given that the company still hasn’t received diesel subsidies.” The oil company, the world’s most indebted, said net debt rose to 284.027 billion reais from 270.712 billion reais, even as it fell in dollar terms. The net debt to EBITDA ratio narrowed to 3.23 from 3.52. The company reiterated that it is still aiming to get that measure down to 2.5 by the end of the year and to meet a target of $21 billion in divestments from 2017 to 2018. A court decision halting privatization of state company assets without congressional approval, ahead of presidential elections in October, means the company may struggle to meet its target. However, Petrobras executives said on Friday the company had received $5 billion from divestments in the first half of the year and expects to receive another $2 billion this year. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a gauge of operational profit known as EBITDA, rose to 30.067 billion reais, from 19.094 billion reais in the same period last year. Results were supercharged by a pickup in oil prices to around $70 per barrel, helping revenue rise to 84.395 billion reais ($22.51 billion), from 66.996 billion reais in the same period last year, when oil traded at well below $60 a barrel."

35.63724046482907," Legal, political headwinds gather for Petrobras despite rising oil prices RIO DE JANEIRO(Reuters) - Rising crude prices should buoy quarterly results at Petrobras but Brazil’s state-controlled oil company faces questions about its future given recently imposed fuel price controls as well as legal and political obstacles to asset sales. Petroleo Brasileiro SA’s second-quarter results on Friday will come just two months after a nationwide trucker strike over rising diesel prices forced Brazil to begin subsidizing Petrobras diesel sales. The move sparked concerns about renewed political meddling and drove investor darling Pedro Parente to resign as chief executive. The tumult came after Petrobras, the world’s most indebted oil company, had appeared to turn the corner on years of graft and mismanagement, delivering the highest profit since 2013 and the first dividend in 3 years in the first quarter. Those results were helped by rising oil prices which should have pumped up revenue further at Petrobras in the second quarter, analysts said. The company is expected to notch net income of $1.505 billion in the quarter, according to consensus estimates, up from $96 million in the year-ago quarter, when they were depressed by a one-off tax-related charge. However, a court decision halting privatization of state company assets without congressional approval, ahead of wide-open presidential elections in October, means the company may struggle to meet its debt reduction targets. And investors are still concerned about what the diesel price controls mean for Petrobras’ balance sheet. “The number-one question mark for the earnings report will be: to what extent has the government-enforced fuel price cut curtailed profitability in the downstream segment,” said Pavel Molchanov, an analyst at Raymond James. The dimming prospects for Petrobras mark a major shift for the oil company which saw its share price soar in May before the trucker strike to its highest point since 2010, ahead of a massive probe into graft that showed that its contractors conspired to bilk it out of billions by overcharging it for projects. Since then, the company has cut costs, improved governance rules, slashed debt through asset sales and let its fuel prices track international markets until the May truckers’ strike. But in July, Petrobras was forced to suspend the sales of its gas pipeline company Transportadora Associada de Gas (TAG), which was expected to fetch north of $7 billion, as well as its Araucaria fertilizer factory, after a supreme court judge ruled Congress had to approve privatizations. The ruling cast a pall over planned sales of the company’s refineries, already less attractive thanks to government diesel price controls, and called into question the company’s ability to reduce a remaining $84 billion in net debt. Parente said in March the company would reach that target this year, or even exceed it if oil prices remained around $70 per barrel. Elections that will install a new Brazilian president in January, add further uncertainty to the mix, with major candidates sharply divided over whether to ease or bolster the government’s role in the company. Unpopular President Michel Temer has sought to curb fears of political intervention, promising to compensate Petrobras for holding diesel prices down under a subsidy program. But Petrobras still hasn’t been reimbursed and many analysts remain unconvinced. “The fact that the new pricing system couldn’t withstand its first test (of high oil prices and a weak currency) is troublesome,” said Allen Good, an analyst at Morningstar.

BR Distribuidora, as the company is known, posted net income of 263 million reais ($70.02 million), nearly quadruple the year-ago figure but below a consensus estimate compiled by Thomson Reuters of 365.87 million reais. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) - a common gauge of operational profitability - totaled 508 million reais in the period, below a consensus estimate of 689.62 million reais but up 5.6 percent above its EBITDA in the same period last year. “The effect of the strike can be summarized as an adjustment in diesel inventories, generating a loss of about 200 million reais,” the company said. In an earnings call on Thursday, an executive at the company said it was in the final phase of contracting a financial advisor for adopting a new model for its convenience stores, called “BR Mania,” which could include seeking a partner.

29.670859884674673," Exclusive: EIG-backed group in exclusive talks for mature Petrobras oilfield clusters RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian state-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA has chosen to enter exclusive talks to sell two shallow water mature oilfields to a group backed by EIG Global Energy Partners, two people familiar with the matter said. Brazilian energy firm Ouro Preto Óleo e Gás, backed by EIG, made the top bid for the so-called Pampo and Enchova clusters, located in the Campos basin off the coast of Rio de Janeiro state, beating out Trident Energy, a Warburg Pincus-backed firm, the sources said. The deal could mark EIG’s debut in the oil production business in Latin America’s top producer. It also makes strategic sense for the private equity firm, which earlier this year bought out Brazilian logistics company Prumo Logistica, operator of the nearby port of Acu. Goldman Sachs will provide debt financing for the bid, whose structure and value were not immediately clear. But sources familiar with the tender, first reported by Reuters in June, said it could fetch around $1 billion. Ouro Preto declined to comment. Petrobras and EIG did not immediately respond to requests for comment. World class geology and dwindling reserves mean the world’s top oil majors have invested billions of dollars to take stakes in Brazil’s prolific deep water oilfields in recent months. But smaller oil companies are often better than large ones at cutting costs and some have honed expertise in squeezing more oil out of mature fields. EIG will follow in the footsteps of First Reserve Corporation and Riverstone Holdings, private equity firms invested in Brazil’s Barra Energia. Ouro Preto, created in 2010, is led by former OGX president Rodolfo Landim and has stakes in several basins throughout Brazil, but none in Campos. A sale of the mature field clusters would also make financial sense for Petrobras, the world’s most indebted oil company, as it seeks to offload $21 billion in assets from 2017 to 2018. According to Petrobras, the Enchova cluster, which includes the Marimba, Enchova, Bonito, Enchova Oeste Bicudo and Pirauna fields, has 32 wells producing 25,100 barrels of oil equivalent per day. With 27 wells, the Badejo, Pampo, Linguado and Trilha fields of the Pampo cluster produce 13,500 barrels of oil equivalent per day. Petrobras is selling the rights to the fields until 2025.

Output has dropped 15.8 percent in 12 months due to the ageing of fields off-shore from Rio de Janeiro and Espirito Santo that account for almost half of the crude pumped by Petrobras. The decline has offset rising output from new platforms in the pre-salt region of the Santos basin. Petrobras has looked at creative ways to handle mature fields by either selling them or entering partnerships to boost recovery efforts. On June 14 it concluded the sale of a 25 percent stake worth $2.9 billion in the Roncador field to Equinor. The partnership with the Norwegian company formerly known as Statoil will include measures to slow the decline of production in Roncador and raise the recovery factor.

35.89411704463449," SBM Offshore says Rio court orders Petrobras to withhold payments AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Dutch marine engineering group SBM Offshore said on Thursday a Brazilian court had ordered Petrobras to provisionally withhold some payments to SBM to ensure the Dutch company pays whatever penalties it may receive in a corruption case. SBM shares fell more than 8 percent in early Amsterdam trade, wiping out gains made on Wednesday, when it announced a new floating production vessel contract with Exxon Mobil. SBM said judges at the federal court in Rio de Janeiro asked Petrobras and SBM to submit further information before deciding a monthly amount to withhold from payments for work SBM does as a contractor for Petrobras. “The company strongly disagrees with the interim decision, is seeking further clarification and is taking all appropriate measures to defend its interests,” it said. SBM, which has been accused of paying bribes to government officials to secure contracts with Petrobras, said it could give no guarantees it would reach a favorable settlement in Brazil. In November, two former executives at SBM pleaded guilty to U.S. charges that they participated in a scheme to bribe officials at three foreign state-run oil companies, including Brazil’s Petrobras. Petrobras has been at the center of Brazil’s largest ever corruption scandal amid investigations into a political kickback scheme involving contractors. In its 2017 annual report, SBM said developments in Brazil, its single largest market, were hurting its ability to get new business. The size of any settlement “cannot be confirmed, which means there is a risk of prolongation of the inability to win orders from Petrobras.” SBM paid $240 million to Dutch authorities in 2014 to settle bribery cases in Equatorial Guinea, Angola and Brazil. It set aside another $280 million in 2016 to settle related issues specifically in Brazil, and took a provision of $238 million last year to settle partly related U.S. claims. The Brazilian court order comes just two days after SBM won a contract to supply a new production vessel for Exxon Mobil in Guyana. That sparked the biggest gain in its shares in nearly two years. The company made a 2017 loss of $203 million, with underlying operating earnings of $806 million."

33.74483041565851," Petrobras-CNPC talks put China closer to first Americas refinery SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil’s state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA and China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) took another step on Wednesday in negotiations that could give the Chinese their first refining capacity in the Americas. The companies announced in a Brazilian securities filing that they had signed a letter of intent advancing talks for a partnership to finish the Comperj refinery near Rio de Janeiro and a “participation” of CNPC in the offshore Marlim oil field. The joint announcement confirms an April report by Reuters that said the companies were working out a deal involving a CNPC investment at Comperj in exchange for a stake in the offshore Campos Basin and rights to use the refinery. The talks highlight rising Chinese interest in the Brazilian energy sector, which has attracted billions of dollars from oil majors over the past year for rights to new exploration blocks as the government lowers barriers to foreigners. The companies did not offer further details and said the implementation of the partnership will depend on the success of final negotiations. “This strategic partnership will strengthen ties between the companies and will contribute to deepen the global strategic partnership between Brazil and China,” the filing said. In November, Pedro Parente, then chief executive of the Brazilian oil firm known as Petrobras, touted a 196 meter oil column discovered in the Marlim field, which he described as the best in the Campos basin. Petrobras and CNPC have already partnered in the giant Libra oil field off the Brazilian coast since 2013. Last year, they also partnered to win exploration rights for the Peroba field, another promising deposit in the area known as the pre-salt, where billions of barrels of oil are trapped under a thick layer of salt beneath the ocean floor. Petrobras has already invested some $13 billion in the Comperj complex, which needs about $3 billion in additional investment to reach an initial capacity of 165,000 barrels per day, people familiar with the matter told Reuters in April."

32.895195398224885," Petrobras suspends major asset sales after justice's decision SAO PAULO (Reuters) - State-run Brazilian oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA (Petrobras) PETR4.SA said on Tuesday it was suspending major asset sales after a Supreme Court justice ruled that Congress must approval any privatizations. Petrobras said it would suspend the sale of certain refineries, its gas pipeline company Transportadora Associada de Gas (TAG) and the Araucaria fertilizer factory. Justice Ricardo Lewandowski said last week that the Brazilian Congress must approve any sales of publicly held shares in companies or their subsidiaries, casting doubt on planned divestitures by Petrobras as well as state utility Centrais Eletricas Brasileiras ELET6.SA. The full court must still decide on the matter. Petrobras, the most indebted oil major, is working to sell $21 billion in assets over two years. The company sold $4.5 billion worth of assets last year and committed to selling an additional $3 billion this year. Preferred shares of Petrobras edged up 0.17 percent to close at 17.50 reais, as the benchmark Bovespa stock index .BVSP gained 1.14 percent. The shares have gained 8.9 percent this year but gains were much higher before May, when an uproar over higher diesel fuel prices triggered a truckers’ protest that paralyzed Brazil’s economy and resulted in the departure of well-regarded former Chief Executive Pedro Parente. The sale process of gas pipeline company TAG is in its final stages. Petrobras is discussing contracts with France's Engie SA ENGIE.PA and had been expected to submit the deal for rebids by the other two interested consortia, led by Australia's Macquarie Group Ltd MQG.AX and EIG Global Energy Partners LLC with United Arab Emirates' sovereign wealth fund Mubadala Development Co. The deal would bring more than $7 billion to the oil company’s coffers.

20.622180186045426," Brazil's Petrobras likely to extend deadline in refineries sale -sources SAO PAULO, June 29 (Reuters) - Brazil’s state-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro may extend the deadline for potential bidders for a 60 percent stake in four refineries to sign non-disclosure agreements, a person with knowledge of the matter said. A ruling from Supreme Court Justice Ricardo Lewandowski this week requiring Congress to approve all sales programs of state-controlled companies threw up another roadblock to the effort to sell the refineries, which had attracted only lackluster interest from potential buyers. Petrobras did not respond to requests for comment. The deadline for potential buyers to sign nondisclosure agreements for the refinery partnerships - a first step in the sale process that does not signal firm interest - had been set for next Monday, July 2, but the person said it may be extended. In a securities filing released on June 18, Petrobras said that five companies had signed nondisclosure agreements, a step that allows them to access more detailed information about the refineries. Reuters reported last month that Petrobras’ decision to cut diesel prices in response to a truckers’ protest was spooking potential refinery buyers. Brazilian conglomerate Ultrapar Participações SA, Cosan SA Industria e Comercio and Cepsa SA, an energy company controlled by sovereign wealth fund Mubadala Development Co, are among the five companies that signed non disclosure agreements, one source with knowledge of the matter said. Another source said Petrobras hopes to get more potential bidders to sign non-disclosure agreements before proceeding to the next phase of the refineries sale. Despite the Lewandowski decision, which has cast a pall over efforts to sell Brazilian state assets in general, a third source within the oil company said it still intends to sell the refineries and is working to conclude the process, as approved by the board. The refineries are expected to be sold in two regional blocks: one in Brazil’s northeast and another in the southern region of the country. Each refinery cluster Petrobras put up for sale has earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), a common gauge of operating profits, of $1 billion, according to a fourth person with knowledge of the process.

Grisolia, who served since August 2017 as CFO of Petrobras Distribuidora, Petrobras’ fuel distribution unit, was named to serve until March 2019. The executive reshuffle comes after a nationwide trucker strike last month over rising diesel costs forced the government to agree to subsidize diesel prices, leading to the resignation of Pedro Parente, a darling of international investors, as Petrobras CEO. The crisis also raised fears of further meddling in Petrobras pricing among investors, who saw the company as finally turning the corner after years of political interference and corruption. Grisolia, an engineer by training, previously served as CFO at small companies such as Brazilian healthcare products supplier Cremer SA, and retailer Inbrands SA. He also worked in the financial area of Esso, an affiliate of Exxon Mobil Corp , Petrobras said in the filing.

22.23819430143382," Brazil labor court hands Petrobras workers victory in $4.5 bln wage spat BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil’s top labor court on Thursday ruled in favor of workers at state-controlled Petroleo Brasileiro in a wage dispute that could cost the world’s most indebted oil company up to 17 billion reais ($4.5 billion). Petrobras, as the company is known, said it will appeal the Superior Labor Court’s ruling in the case, brought by oil workers seeking more pay. The ruling points to gathering headwinds for the company, which settled a nearly $3 billion lawsuit with U.S. investors in January and is seeking to cut debt through a $21 billion divestment program. The case centered around Petrobras’ compensation policy since 2007, when it adopted the so-called Minimum Level and Regime Remuneration (RMNR) scheme. Workers argued that payments tied to special work arrangements, such as night shifts and hazardous work, should be excluded from an agreement on the wage policy. The ruling could potentially saddle the firm with up to 17 billion reais in added payments. But Petrobras, backed by the Federal Attorney General’s Office, argued that the payments should be included in the base calculation for RMNR, as agreed to in a collective salary agreement with workers. The head of the Superior Labor Court, Brito Pereira, had to vote to untie the ruling, which had 13 labor judges voting for the employees and 12 for the company. The change means some 59,000 employees could receive a wage increase of up to 35 percent, according to calculations by the Attorney General’s Office. Petrobras plans to appeal the decision in the Supreme Federal Court, one person with knowledge of the matter said. But the oil giant faces plenty of other headaches. A nationwide strike by truckers over high fuel costs forced embattled President Michel Temer to cut diesel prices, in part via subsidies paid to Petrobras. While the cash-strapped government has promised to compensate Petrobras for losses incurred by the price cut, some doubt whether the company will be made whole and the incident drove CEO Pedro Parente to resign."

The boost in refinery usage preceded a nationwide trucker strike over rising diesel prices last month. It led Petrobras to lower diesel prices as the government slashed taxes on the fuel. Meanwhile, private fuel importers, which have invested over the last year to increase their supply in the country, say they are struggling to compete with the fuel prices charged by Petrobras.

Delonex, Petrobras and Vitol declined to comment. Africa Oil did not respond to a request for comment. The Vitol-led group emerged as winners from a number of groups that bid for the assets in its initial two rounds, which included rival commodity trader Glencore. Heavily indebted Petrobras launched the sale of Petrobras Oil & Gas BV, or Petrobras Africa, in which it holds 50 percent, as part plans to offload $21 billion in assets through 2018. The sale, announced last year, includes the 40 percent stake of Petrobras Africa held by a subsidiary of Grupo BTG Pactual SA and the 10 percent holding owned by Helios Investment Partners. Scotiabank is running the sale process with Evercore, according to the sale document. The deal would offer the consortium a stake in some of Nigeria’s largest and lowest-cost fields. Vitol is expected to shoulder the largest part of the investment, spending an estimated $1 billion, according to one source. Petrobras Africa has stakes in two offshore blocks, known as OMLs, that contain two producing fields. The Agbami field in OML 127 is operated by an affiliate of U.S. firm Chevron CVX.N and the Akpo field in OML 130 is operated by Total SA TOTF.PA.

The source, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak publicly about the issue, said it was likely that Parente would be granted clearance to take the BRF job, since apparently there would be no conflict of interest. Parente is already chairman at BRF, a post he took in April when shareholders at the food processor were seeking a management overhaul in the wake of a food safety probe that caused plant closures.

8.216846647802086," Leftist presidential hopeful would end Brazil oil refining monopoly: adviser SAO PAULO (Reuters) - The leading leftist candidate in Brazil’s presidential race, Ciro Gomes, would end the refining monopoly of state oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA, a senior Gomes adviser told Reuters. The plan laid out by Nelson Marconi, policy director for the Gomes campaign, breaks with longstanding Brazilian industrial policy and could face blowback from powerful unions at Petrobras, as the company is known. “Regarding refineries, we absolutely want to increase competition,” Marconi said late on Tuesday in an interview at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, where he teaches economics. “For the love of God, refining does not need to be a Petrobras monopoly,” he said, adding that the state-controlled company could sell some refining assets and others could be encouraged to invest in new plants. His comments underscore how a May trucker strike over fuel prices, which paralyzed much of Brazil’s economy and forced the government to slash diesel taxes, has sparked bold proposals for Petrobras ahead of the October election. A law making Petrobras Brazil’s sole petroleum refiner was struck down in 1997 after more than four decades. But its de facto monopoly went unchallenged until April, when Petrobras laid out plans to sell stakes in some refineries, drawing an outcry from unions and many politicians on the left. Marconi said Gomes, a fiery center-left former governor of Ceará state, still demands the reversal of recent auctions granting offshore exploration and production rights to global oil majors, who would be compensated for canceled contracts. Gomes has said President Michel Temer, who took office in 2016 after the impeachment of leftist President Dilma Rousseff, lacked the legitimacy to rewrite the rules of those auctions, which drew billions of dollars from Exxon Mobil Corp, Royal Dutch Shell Plc, BP Plc and others. The economic proposals of the Gomes camp mark a return in many ways to the state-driven development policies pursued for 13 years under Workers Party presidents Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and his hand-picked successor, Rousseff. Lula oversaw a commodity-driven boom but Rousseff, who sought to maintain many of his policies, was forced from office in 2016 following her impeachment amid the worst recession in decades. With Lula barred from the presidential race due to a bribery sentence, Gomes has emerged in recent polls as the strongest standard bearer on the left. He is trailing behind right-wing lawmaker Jair Bolsonaro and environmentalist Marina Silva. Like Lula and Rousseff’s economic advisers, Marconi argued for more public infrastructure spending and lending by state bank BNDES. The development bank should resume use of a heavily subsidized policy rate known as the TJLP for loans rather than the market-based TLP rate introduced under Temer, he said. Marconi also said the central bank should cut its benchmark rate below from an all-time low and work to maintain a more “competitive” exchange rate. “For us, this level of 3.80 (reais per dollar), around that, is more or less in the right place. The trouble is keeping it there,” he said. The best instruments to keep the currency from strengthening would be a sovereign wealth fund and central bank interventions rather than capital controls, he added. Such breaks with more orthodox economic policy and pledges to roll back Temer’s market-friendly reforms have stoked investor concerns about Gomes, contributing to a market sell-off on recent polls. Still, Marconi said Gomes was firmly committed to fiscal discipline, marking a sharp contrast with policy under Rousseff. A 15 percent cut to industrial subsidies, means-tested social security reform and new taxes on personal fortunes, corporate dividends and financial transactions would help Gomes deliver a fiscal surplus before interest payments within two or three years, he said."

A consortium of Equinor, Exxon Mobil Corp and Petroleos de Portugal made Thursday’s most aggressive play, offering more than three times the minimum bid for the Uirapuru block in the Santos Basin off the coast of Rio de Janeiro. That meant partnering with Brazil’s state-run oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA, or Petrobras, which joined all three winning consortia in the round. Brazil’s cash-strapped government collected 3.15 billion reais ($800 million) in fixed signing bonuses at the auction. The world’s leading oil producers have been spending top dollar to lock up access to Brazil’s coveted offshore, seeking to replenish depleted reserves as oil prices rise. Billions of barrels of oil are in the Brazilian pre-salt, beneath a thick layer of salt under the ocean floor. Unexpected changes to diesel pricing in Brazil last month raised questions about renewed political interference at Petrobras and triggered the surprise exit of Chief Executive Officer Pedro Parente, who had turned the company around. Yet Thursday’s auction, including winning bids from Chevron Corp, BP Plc and Royal Dutch Shell Plc, underscored enduring appetite for Brazil’s offshore despite any meddling in Petrobras’ downstream business. “We didn’t really make a connection with the fuel prices and the bidding rounds. It is quite an independent process,” said Anders Opedal, country manager for Equinor, which changed its name from Statoil last month. Ivan Monteiro, speaking as Petrobras CEO for the first time since being appointed on Friday, said the company would keep seeking to boost its exploration portfolio. Petrobras, Equinor, Exxon and Petroleos de Portugal won the Uirapuru block by offering the government 75.49 percent of oil after covering costs - well above the 22.18 percent minimum bid. The Uirapuru block is near the North Carcara area, which the same consortium clinched in an October round. Opedal said it was too soon to say if the blocks would be developed jointly. Equinor also won rights to develop the Dois Irmaos block of the Campos Basin, along with BP and Petrobras. Exxon, one of the few oil majors without stakes in Brazil’s world class pre-salt geology until late last year, has stakes in 25 Brazilian blocks after Thursday’s win. ($1 = 3.9323 reais)"
3.266855788263228," Brazil regulator seeks comment on fuel price change frequency RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian oil regulator ANP said on Tuesday it would seek public comment over a period of several weeks on a potential rule that could set limits on how often fuel prices change in the country. The comment period, which will take place from June 11 to July 2, follows a nationwide trucker strike over diesel price hikes last month that paralyzed much of Latin America’s biggest economy. In an emailed statement, ANP said the process was aimed at soliciting suggestions about a rule that would create a “minimum period” for changing fuel prices. It was not clear whether the regulator had the power to restrict the frequency of fuel price changes by state-controlled oil producer Petroleo Brasileiro SA, known as Petrobras. The company had adopted a policy of nearly daily adjustments under its former chief executive, pricing changes in alignment with international markets. In a statement to Reuters, Petrobras said it would join the discussions by the regulator. The company said “price formation based on market prices and more predictability” may increase competition. Suggestions about a new fuel pricing policy may be sent by consumers, oil companies and state entities, ANP said. President Michel Temer ended the trucker protest by agreeing to cut diesel prices and change the frequency of price adjustments, wiping out a third of the market cap of Petrobras over fears of growing political interference. Public anger has also been building over gasoline prices, which have also recently risen and were not addressed by the agreement with the truckers."

After a trucker’s strike over rising diesel prices paralyzed Latin America’s largest economy, the government reacted by imposing fuel subsidies, worrying investors who saw it as a sign of new, unwelcome interference in state-run Petrobras. Parente resigned in protest, and former chief financial officer Ivan Monteiro was installed in his place on Friday, providing some comfort to jittery markets which hope he will press on with Parente’s market-friendly program. Shares in Petrobras - formally called Petroleo Brasileiro SA - rose more than 8 percent on Monday, helped by the decision to name Monteiro CEO as well as by some bargain-hunting after the shares lost about a fifth of their value. However, it is unlikely that 57-year-old former bank executive Monteiro will be able to escape government pressure, analysts said in the days following his appointment. Monteiro may want to turn Petrobras into a streamlined profit machine - but outgoing President Michel Temer and other politicians are scrambling to appease angry voters ahead of presidential polls in October. “Ivan Monteiro will be under serious political pressure because of the elections,” said Edmar Almeida, an energy professor at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro. “Candidates who are against asset sales, for example, will push hard against any major Petrobras decision on divestments.” Petrobras was not immediately available to comment. A spokesman for the president’s office said that the government would not meddle in pricing. Temer effectively ended the truckers’ protest after he promised to cut diesel prices by about 12 percent for 60 days through a mix of tax cuts and subsidies to Petrobras. The government also agreed to restrict price changes at the pump, reimbursing Petrobras for related losses. In another sign of a heavier government hand, the Mining and Energy Ministry said on Friday it was seeking a mechanism to “protect the consumer from the volatility of fuel prices at the pump.” But details have been scarce as to how Petrobras will be compensated and investors are wary of further meddling, especially steps that could extend beyond diesel to gasoline. The diesel subsidy plan and Parente’s exit “have all raised questions and increased the risk perception of political interference,” analysts at Brazilian bank Itau said in a client note. A wide-open election will add further pressure on the government to keep voters happy. Leftist candidate Ciro Gomes said in a video: “It is not enough for Parente to go, it is necessary to demand that the pricing policy that he imposed be changed.” Parente had insisted as a condition of taking the debt-laden and scandal-tarnished company’s helm in 2016 that he control how Petrobras priced fuel. Monteiro, seen by oil companies and investors as an avid supporter of changes sought by Parente, is not expected to get the same carte-blanche from the government as his predecessor, as the political mood in Brasilia has shifted. “Future reforms are going to be met with a jaundiced eye,” said Allen Good, an analyst at Morningstar. More than just potential losses from fuel pricing are at stake. Petrobras is hoping to sell majority stakes in four refineries, but possible investors are already spooked by the prospect of competing with a company that is forced to sell fuel below cost, sources told Reuters last month. An aggressive two-year divestment target of $21 billion by the end of 2018, part of a bid to cut debt, could also be in play. But a round of bidding for oil blocks in Brazil’s choice offshore basins on Thursday is not expected to be affected, say oil majors, who will likely partner with Petrobras to win some of the blocks. And some see potential benefits from Parente’s exit, including the possibility of a quicker conclusion to a drawn-out dispute with the government over the value of the offshore transfer-of-rights area, where Petrobras paid top dollar to produce 5 billion barrels of oil. Oil majors are watching the negotiations closely, because a resolution could unlock an auction of nearby areas, considered to be some of the finest geology in Brazil’s pre-salt play. “I would guess the transfer-of-rights will be resolved because Ivan is more compliant than Pedro Parente,” said John Forman, former chief of oil regulator ANP. “He will yield more easily.”"

-2.575007561361327," Petrobras mulls scrapping daily gasoline price changes: paper SAO PAULO/RIO DE JANEIRO, June 4 (Reuters) - The new management of Brazilian state-led oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA, headed by interim Chief Executive Officer Ivan Monteiro, has agreed to discuss ditching daily gasoline price changes, a newspaper reported on Monday. The company has imposed two conditions: that Petrobras’ prices stay in the range of international prices and that the company be protected against imports when its prices are artificially lower than foreign competitors, paper Valor Economico said, citing government sources. An 11-day truckers’ strike to protest high fuel prices in late May put a stranglehold on Brazil’s economy, and drew pledges from the government to roll back some market-based initiatives that have been implemented at Petrobras in recent years. It also led to the departure of CEO Pedro Parente, who resigned on Friday in the midst of increasing government interference in the company. He was replaced by Monteiro, the chief financial officer. The government’s communications have varied widely in recent days. Brazilian President Michel Temer has already announced measures to change the frequency of diesel price changes, while also saying there will be no interference in the company’s pricing policies.

7.5575602794229795," Brazil's president scrambles to name new Petrobras CEO RIO DE JANEIRO/BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian President Michel Temer scrambled to name a new chief executive for state-controlled oil producer Petroleo Brasileiro SA on Friday, after the surprise resignation of CEO Pedro Parente over fuel pricing policies. Parente’s departure wiped $11 billion off the market value of the company, known as Petrobras, and marked the highest profile casualty so far of a trucker’s strike that virtually paralyzed Brazil for nearly two weeks. Once a beacon of national pride, Petrobras had become engulfed in a damaging corruption scandal and overloaded with debt before turnaround wizard Parente’s arrival as CEO two years ago. His replacement Ivan Monteiro, until Friday Petrobras’ chief financial officer and formerly a top executive at state-controlled bank Banco do Brasil, will be under pressure to show he can keep cutting debt and pushing investor-friendly policies. Petrobras’ board said it had named Monteiro as interim CEO at a rapidly organized meeting on Friday, and Temer recommended him to take on the job on a longer-term basis later in the day. However, with elections looming, Monteiro’s tenure is likely to end in December when the president leaves office. Shares in Petrobras, Latin America’s biggest oil producer, closed down 15 percent on Friday, wiping some 40 billion reais ($11 billion) from the company’s capitalization. The real currency weakened as much as 1 percent against the dollar. Petrobras bonds also fell, as Moody’s called Parente’s resignation credit negative for the company. Temer sought to reassure markets as he announced his recommendation of Monteiro. “We will maintain the economic policy that took the company out of the red in the last two years and made it once again one of the most respected in Brazil and abroad,” he said. “There will be no interference at all in the company’s pricing policy.” Parente arrived at a Friday morning meeting with Temer with his resignation letter already in hand, a company source and a person close to the government said. In it, Parente said he was leaving because he would “not be an obstacle” to new pricing policies that might be necessary to shield Brazilian consumers from volatility in world oil prices. During 2010-13, the company posted about $40 billion in refining losses due to unprofitable fuel prices, imposed by the then-government, according to Moody’s. A key plank of Parente’s turnaround campaign for the company and a condition for his taking the top job in 2016 was freedom to control fuel prices. He sought to align those more closely with international markets through nearly daily price adjustments. But on Sunday Temer, governing with rock-bottom approval ratings, announced plans to placate striking truck drivers - protesting the high cost of diesel - by freezing fuel prices on a monthly basis and taking other measures to bring domestic diesel prices down. Late on Friday, Brazil’s Mines and Energy Ministry said it wanted to create a pricing mechanism that would protect consumers without impacting the policies of Petrobras and other energy companies. ‘REACHED HIS LIMIT’ Although Temer promised the government would compensate Petrobras for losses incurred by its intervention on fuel prices, Sunday’s move crossed Parente’s red line against political meddling, sources said. One source close to Parente said the 65-year-old had stepped down because he had “reached his limit” with government interference. Another source close to Temer said the president was surprised by the resignation and had not sought to push the CEO out. Parente’s departure comes days before Brazil hopes to attract foreign oil companies to bid on oil fields in its coveted “presalt” exploration areas and leaves in limbo several of his key priorities, including selling major refineries. Also unresolved is a long-running dispute with the government over an oil-rich offshore area, which could represent a windfall for Petrobras if a deal is reached. Parente’s policies had helped pushed Petrobras shares to a multiyear peak just last month, but a rise in international oil prices triggered anger at Brazilian gas stations and led to calls from politicians and unions for the executive to go. The company risks becoming a political football in October’s presidential election, with far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro’s key economic adviser calling for its privatization, while leftist Ciro Gomes has warned investors to avoid state energy sector assets because he would expropriate them. While investors and oil industry insiders bemoaned Parente’s departure, others rejoiced. “Parente was the most responsible for the crisis that Brazil has faced with the trucker strike,” the truckers lobby said in a statement. “Nothing justifies the abusive diesel prices put in place by the company in the last few months.” Petrobras oil workers, who walked off the job earlier week in part to demand Parente’s dismissal, also celebrated. “You don’t deserve to walk through the doors of Petrobras again,” said Jose Maria Rangel, leader of FUP, Brazil’s largest oil workers union, in a video message. Parente’s market-friendly policies had ultimately made him the scapegoat of the truckers strike and its fallout, said Roberto Castello Branco, a former Petrobras board member. “The pressure on him was enormous,” he said. “For the country, for the company, a great source of uncertainty has opened that is very dangerous,” he added.

Engie had the highest bid among three consortia interested in acquiring Transportadora Associada de Gás SA, known as TAG.

-11.705450750493188," Brazil's president mulls scrapping Petrobras market-based fuel pricing: source BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazil’s President Michel Temer may scrap a market-based pricing mechanism used by state-run oil firm Petrobras and revert to selling all fuel below costs after a trucking strike that almost paralyzed the nation, a government source told Reuters on Tuesday. Talk of temporarily lowering prices on just diesel to end the havoc the nine-day strike brought on Latin America’s largest economy sent Petrobras shares plunging 15 percent on Monday. Truckers are protesting a 50 percent increase in diesel prices under the nearly one-year-old Petrobras policy of almost daily adjustments following international prices. The source, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter, said the pricing policy worked well when oil prices held steady for years at $40-50 a barrel, and the Brazilian currency remained stable against the dollar. But oil has recently surged to $70-80 a barrel boosted by plummeting Venezuelan production, strong global demand and looming U.S. sanctions on Iran. Meanwhile Brazil’s currency has weakened 11 percent this year on political uncertainty. “Without that (stability), we have a problem. We need to study alternatives,” the official said. He said talks on the issue have already begun between the government and Petrobras. A spokeswoman for Petrobras chief executive officer Pedro Parente declined to comment. Temer acknowledged in a television interview on Tuesday that he was open to reviewing the pricing policy. “Petrobras has recovered in these two years. It had been in a disastrous situation for a long time, and we did not want to change the company’s policy,” Temer told government broadcaster TV Brasil. “We can re-examine the policy, though with great care.” On Sunday, moving to settle the truckers strike, Temer announced tax cuts and subsidies to reduce domestic diesel prices by 0.46 real per liter, or about 13 percent of the current price at the pump, freezing them at that level for 60 days. The prospect of government interference in Petrobras pricing policy sent its share prices plummeting on Monday. That slide added to losses a week earlier that reduced the stock price by nearly one third, though shares rebounded 14 percent on Tuesday to close at 19.30 reais. The government official said initial talks had begun between Mines and Energy Minister Moreira Franco and Parente, architect of the company’s recovery. Parente has resisted change, but has appreciated the need for greater predictability in price adjustments, the official said.

-12.966790365200803," Brazil deal to end truckers' strike rattles Petrobras investors BRASILIA/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Petrobras shares plunged 15 percent on Monday after Brazil’s government offered new fuel subsidies and softened the oil producer’s pricing policy in a bid to settle a truckers’ strike that has wreaked havoc on Latin America’s largest economy. As a result of tax cuts and subsidies announced by President Michel Temer late on Sunday, domestic diesel prices would fall 0.46 real per liter, or about 13 percent of the current price at the pump, and remain frozen for 60 days. Shareholders in state-controlled Petróleo Brasileiro SA PETR4.SA, which earlier this month soared after the company reported its highest profits in five years, have been hammered as the stock lost nearly a third of its value in the past week. Compounding the sense of crisis, Petrobras management sent a letter to its workers urging them not to follow through on a strike planned for later in the week, saying “paralysis and pressure for adjusting prices” would hurt the company or country as a whole. Under the deal announced by Temer, after the initial 60-day period price freeze, Petrobras will start adjusting diesel prices monthly, a switch from its current policy of daily price changes. Petrobras said in a securities filing that the government had agreed to compensate it for any losses. But investors were skeptical. Since May 18, when speculation began that the government might need to negotiate with truckers over diesel prices, Petrobras has lost 127.5 billion reais ($34.13 billion) in market value. Its drop on Monday led a broader sell-off in Brazil's benchmark Bovespa index .BVSP, which slumped 4.5 percent and is now in negative territory for the year. The latest pricing announcement “suggests increasing risk that the government will interfere in Petrobras affairs again or force them to subsidize the domestic market again,” said Morningstar analyst Allen Good, adding it was “a change in the market-friendly policy implemented in the last couple of years.” For years, Petrobras subsidized domestic fuel prices, boosting its debt load, a policy current Chief Executive Pedro Parente - whose days some investors fear may be numbered - has tried to reverse. “There were rumors last week Parente might resign,” Good said. “The latest decisions might force his hand.” Petrobras has denied the rumors, saying Parente has no intention of quitting. The subsidy and tax cut measures represented Temer’s latest concessions to the truckers, whose strike has won popular support even as it has severely hampered the flow of food, fuel and key exports in Latin America’s largest economy. A truckers’ association behind the nationwide protest has told drivers to get back to work, but the government said progress had been slow and highway police said 556 highway blockades by protesters remained in place. The moves also left Temer’s government scrambling to win congressional approval for several tax measures needed to avoid breaking budget rules, a daunting endeavor ahead of October’s congressional and presidential elections. Brazilian farm groups, meanwhile, warned that production and exports of key commodities like coffee and soy would fall if the truckers continue to block roads. [nE6N1SV00B] Some 64 million chickens have starved to death as a result of the strike, meat group ABPA said on Sunday. Brazil is the world’s largest chicken exporter. As many as 150 poultry and pork processing plants have stopped production for lack of feed and storage space, the association said. Among other sectors, Brazilian steelmakers like Cia Siderurgica Nacional CSNA3.SA and Usiminas USIM5.SA may lose up to 20 percent of their revenue in May due to the strike, analysts from XP Investimentos said in a research note.

As a result of tax cuts and subsidies announced by President Michel Temer late on Sunday, domestic diesel prices would fall 0.46 real per liter and remain frozen at that level for 60 days. Yet to avoid breaking budget rules, the Brazilian congress would need to approve several tax measures, a daunting endeavor ahead of this year’s parliamentary and presidential elections. The measures represented Temer’s latest concessions to the truckers, whose strike has won popular support even as it has severely hampered the flow of food, fuel and key exports in Latin America’s largest economy. After the initial 60-day period price freeze, state-controlled Petróleo Brasileiro SA will start adjusting diesel prices monthly, a switch from its current policy of daily price changes. Should global diesel prices fall in coming months, the government could choose to trim subsidies, Finance Minister Eduardo Guardia said. Petrobras said in a securities filing that the government had agreed to compensate it for any losses. Still, its shares plunged to a four-month low. For years, Petrobras subsidized domestic fuel prices, boosting its debt load - a policy current Chief Executive Pedro Parente has tried to reverse - contributing to the diesel price hikes that triggered the truckers’ rebellion. Renewed worries about Petrobras’ independence from political inference have shaved 113 billion reais off its market capitalization since the truckers’ strike began a week ago. To partially offset the subsidies’ cost, which could reach as much as 9.5 billion reais ($2.6 billion) this year, and avoid missing its 2018 budget goal, Guardia said the government would cut spending by 3.8 billion reais. It will also have to hike taxes to offset an additional 4-billion real loss from diesel tax cuts to avoid breaking budget rules. That would be partially paid for by an increase in payroll taxes that has struggled to win congressional approval for months, but would also require further tax measures that the government will unveil once that plan is passed, Guardia said. Guardia also said the government will implement a variable tax on diesel imports that will kick in whenever global prices fall below local benchmark prices, protecting Petrobras’ competitiveness. Newspaper Valor Econômico had reported on Monday that Petrobras had proposed such a plan."

The 10 percent cut, which will last 15 days, is aimed at calming tensions over surging fuel prices, which stoked a nationwide trucker protest hammering commerce across Latin America’s largest economy. In announcing the surprise move late on Wednesday, which should cost around 350 million reais, the chief executive of the oil firm known as Petrobras, Pedro Parente, insisted that the company was not responding to government pressure. But the nearly 13-percent slide in Petrobras shares on Thursday suggests investors fear otherwise, raising the specter of a return to problems of recent years when the government forced the company to sell fuel at a loss to tamp down inflation. “It’s a disaster,” former Petrobras board member Roberto Branco said of Wednesday’s cut. “It sets a dangerous precedent and favors a return to the politization of fuel pricing.” Under Parente, Petrobras management has distanced itself from government policymaking, turning the page on a major political bribery scandal and recovered profitability, lifting shares to an eight-year high this month. The move to adjust gasoline and diesel prices almost daily since July in line with global markets bolstered investor confidence. Meanwhile, Parente has orchestrated an operational turnaround, helping the company to book its biggest quarterly profit in five years in May.

-34.74426837404386," Exclusive: Vitol, Glencore, Shell in running for Petrobras' Nigerian assets LONDON (Reuters) - The world's three largest oil traders are competing to buy the African arm of Brazil's Petrobras PETR4.SA that owns stakes in two major Nigerian offshore oil blocks, industry and banking sources with knowledge of the matter said, after submitting bids earlier this month. Last November, state-controlled Petroleo Brasileiro SA, known as Petrobras, launched the sale of 100 percent of Petrobras Oil & Gas BV, or Petrobras Africa, as part of the heavily-indebted company’s plan to offload $21 billion in assets through 2018 as it also faces a massive corruption scandal. Petrobras holds half the shares in the company while 40 percent are held by a subsidiary of Grupo BTG Pactual SA and 10 percent by Helios Investment Partners. Bankers have previously estimated the value of the Petrobras venture to be about $2 billion. The venture has stakes in two offshore blocks that contain two producing fields, the major Agbami field in OML 127, operated by a local Chevron CVX.N affiliate and the Akpo field in OML 130 operated by Total SA TOTF.PA. The sale has attracted the top trading firms which are always on the hunt for long-term crude supplies. Mercuria and BP BP.L had also its potential. In early May, three consortiums including the major trading companies submitted bids to buy Petrobras Africa. Vitol bid together with the oil upstream subsidiary of U.S. private equity firm Warburg Pincus called Delonex and Canadian-listed Africa Oil AOI.TO, an oil and gas exploration firm that is part of Sweden's Lundin Group LUPE.ST. Glencore GLEN.L joined with Nigerian listed firm Seplat SEPLAT.LG and French firm Maurel & Prom MAUP.PA that is majority-owned by the Indonesian government. Indonesia's state oil firm Pertamina also backs Maurel & Prom and owns a 20 percent stake in Seplat. The third bidder was privately-held Famfa Oil together with Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.L. Famfa Oil is one of the concessionaires in the operator of the Agbami oil field along with Chevron, Statoil and Petrobras. Chevron holds the majority stake. Vitol, Glencore, Shell, Africa Oil declined to comment. Maurel, Famfa and Seplat did not respond for requests for comment. Petrobras is expected to make a decision by the end of May. But the sources said that this could slide as there was a still a possibility that the bids might be split between the two oil block stakes. Agbami produces about 240,000 barrels per day (bpd) while the Akpo field in OML 130 produces nearly 130,000 bpd with a second field Egina due to come onstream in the same block later this year.

Confirming a Reuters report, Engie chief executive Isabelle Kocher said on an analyst call that the company - which has major investments in Brazil hydro power - wants to diversify its Brazilian activities and had made an offer for the network. “Apparently we presented the best offer in the bidding phase and we are currently negotiating the terms and conditions of a potential transaction,” Kocher said. She added the talks are not based on exclusivity yet and are set to continue in coming months. If Engie wins the competition, it would make the acquisition with partners, she said. Engie is also starting to develop an energy services activity in the country. Sources told Reuters earlier this month that in order to comply with rules established by a federal audit court, Petrobras will in June invite the other two groups that presented bids - led by Australia’s Macquarie Group and UAE’s Mubadala Development Co - to offer new bids for the pipeline, based on the contract negotiated with Engie.

-12.463019674627676," Petrobras' profit jumps on asset sales, higher oil prices RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil’s Petroleo Brasileiro SA reported a 57 percent surge in quarterly profit on Tuesday, boosted by higher oil prices and asset sales, fanning hopes that the state-controlled oil company may be moving past a massive corruption scandal. Petrobras PETR4.SA, as the firm is known, posted a net profit of 6.961 billion reais ($1.96 billion) in the first quarter, the biggest in five years, as it continued to cut debt. It also announced a dividend of 0.05 reais a share, its first in three years. Shares were largely unchanged in early afternoon trading in Sao Paulo after initially rising following the results. Adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, a gauge of operational profit known as EBITDA, crept up just 2 percent to 25.669 billion reais in the first quarter. The results represented progress for a company striving under Chief Executive Pedro Parente to move past the fallout from a probe, begun in 2014, that showed construction firms bribed Petrobras officials and politicians to win inflated contracts. The scandal sent Petrobras’ share price tumbling, hammered its bottom line, drove up debt and led to a series of lawsuits. In a client note, JPMorgan described the latest results as a “solid quarter,” adding that the “deleveraging story continues to be delivered.” Petrobras, which still holds the dubious title of the world’s most indebted oil company, said it generated 3.223 billion reais from the sale of stakes in assets like the Lapa field, and the Iara area in the offshore Santos basin. It said net debt fell more than 3 percent to 270.71 billion reais ($76.23 billion) in the period on a sequential basis. Rising international oil prices, which increased from an average $54.04 per barrel in the fourth quarter to $60.18 per barrel in the first three months of the year, helped boost results, the company said. Parente also said the company was making progress in talks with the Brazilian government over the so-called transfer-of-rights area and could reach a deal by May 17. Petrobras was granted rights to drill for 5 billion barrels of oil and gas in that area, located in Brazil’s coveted offshore pre-salt layer, though the value of the contract has been disputed. Executives also said they saw the company further recovering market share in Brazil’s gasoline and diesel markets. The company said preliminary figures showed it had boosted its share of the gasoline market to 86 percent last month from 80 percent in March while its share of the diesel market rose to 79 percent from 77 percent in the same period. Free cash flow was positive for the second quarter in a row but down 3 percent year-on-year as the result of the first payment to U.S. investors who won a class action against the company in January tied to the graft scandal. Revenue from sales reached 74.461 billion reais ($20.97 billion) in the quarter, up 9 percent from the same period last year. ($1 = 3.5512 reais)"

The seven new platforms would allow the firm, whose output has declined this year, to add up to 500,000 barrels per day of new oil production next year, said Hugo Repsold, Petrobras’ chief technology and production development executive, on the sidelines of the Offshore Technology Conference in Houston. “We have faced some delays in the licensing process for the platforms, but they have finished, so the Tartaruga platform is almost ready to start producing. It will take us 45-60 days more, but wells have already been connected,” Repsold told journalists. The first of this year’s new platforms started service earlier this month. The remaining five platforms following Tartaruga will be installed mostly in December after they arrive from China, the executive added.

Petrobras, as the company is known, will likely decide by Monday whether to call a second round with the highest bidders, or enter exclusive talks with the single highest bidder, the sources said. A May 7 board meeting will approve the decision taken by management committees in the coming days. Petrobras declined to comment.

A second round is also required if Petrobras, after choosing to negotiate just with one bidder, agrees to any change in the acquisition contract that involves a financial impact. Petrobras asked the bids to value TAG based on last December’s financial statements, but with a provision to adjust bids by an interest rate equivalent to Brazil’s interbank rate plus 3 percent until the date of the closing.

Eletrobras, as the state-controlled power company is known, owes state oil firm Petrobras for fuel supplies used in thermal generation in northern Brazil. The dispute has been a hurdle for Eletrobras’ privatization, a landmark proposal of President Michel Temer’s administration. The details of the agreement could be unveiled as soon as Friday following an Eletrobras board meeting, Valor said, citing a source with knowledge of the matter.

-17.363377796232687," After rescuing Petrobras, CEO Parente called in to calm BRF SAO PAULO (Reuters) - A Brazilian commodities giant racking up losses as tensions flare on its board and corruption scandals grab headlines — Pedro Parente has been here before. The scale of challenges at food processor BRF SA may not compare with what the 65-year-old chief executive of Petroleo Brasileiro SA tackled at the state-run oil company. But people with firsthand knowledge of his work say the experience prepared him well for the task ahead. Parente is expected to be confirmed on Thursday as chairman of the board at BRF, the world’s largest poultry exporter, which lost more than 1 billion reais ($290 million) last year and is seeking its fourth chief executive in five months. His nomination has helped forge consensus among bitterly divided shareholders, who are counting on his track record of cool-headed leadership amid crisis to help settle the currently headless chicken processor. BRF shares have surged more than 20 percent in the week since news of Parente’s nomination was first announced. “Parente alone won’t pull off a turnaround at BRF, but he’ll calm the board, which is a nervous wreck right now,” said one of the executives familiar with his leadership style, who asked not to be named because his appointment had not been finalized. If confirmed as chairman on Thursday, Parente has said he will stay on at Petrobras but resign from the board of stock exchange operator B3 SA Brasil Bolsa Balcão. It is not uncommon for Brazilian executives to sit on multiple boards, but rarely does one person take the helm of two companies facing such serious challenges. Parente has rarely shied away from a challenge. As a central banker in the 1980s, he navigated Brazil’s sovereign debt defaults. As chief of staff to President Fernando Henrique Cardoso in 2001, he handled a severe electricity crisis. And when Petrobras was beset with corruption scandals and crippling debts nearly two years ago, he agreed to take the role of CEO. Petrobras shares have since climbed more than 150 percent. Another former colleague highlighted Parente’s work prior to Petrobras, as CEO of Bunge Ltd from 2010 to 2014, giving him a background in the grains trade, which proved to be an Achilles heel for BRF last year. Poor management of a spike in the price of corn, which is used for chicken feed, contributed to BRF’s heavy losses. Some analysts blamed a recently installed team of retail and finance executives for ignoring its agribusiness roots. Former Chairman Abilio Diniz, a supermarket tycoon who stepped down this month, said last year that BRF had lost connection at times between the sales and production sides of the business. “Since Parente has worked at a trading firm, he certainly understands the challenges,” the second executive said, adding that increased competition in Brazil’s corn market had forced the food industry to take a more proactive approach to sourcing. A third person said Parente’s efforts at Petrobras to turn the page on years of alleged political corruption at the state oil giant had also prepared him confront an ongoing inspections scandal at BRF. Chief Executive Pedro Faria was arrested last month on charges that he and other executives were aware of fraudulent practices to evade food safety checks. The news erased a fifth of BRF’s market capitalization in a day and contributed to trade issues with Europe, which has blocked imports from several BRF plants. Faria’s successor, José Aurélio Drummond Jr, resigned on Monday, giving a new board led by Parente a chance to make its mark immediately on management."
-11.325315257847695," Petrobras scraps Liquigas IPO, eyes antitrust risk in sale -sources SAO PAULO, April 25 (Reuters) - Petroleo Brasileiro SA has given up on the idea of selling its Brazilian liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) unit through an initial public offering (IPO) and decided to reopen a sale process, three people with knowledge of the matter said. The state-controlled oil company has not yet set a date for interested companies to deliver bids and is still discussing the best way to avoid problems with antitrust authorities, the sources added, asking for anonymity because talks are private. Petrobras, as the company is known, has sounded out banks and investors for a potential IPO of Liquigas Distribuidora SA, but advisers said it would be a hard sell, especially to international investors, according to the sources. Liquigas sells gas cylinders, used mainly for cooking in Brazilian households not served by gas pipelines — a segment unfamiliar to investors in more developed markets. Petrobras had agreed to sell the subsidiary to a unit of Ultrapar Participações SA in 2016 for 2.8 billion reais ($800 million), but Brazilian antitrust watchdog Cade blocked the deal. Ultragaz, a unit of Ultrapar, is Brazil’s largest LPG distributor and Liquigas is the second biggest. In talks with banks, Petrobras has discussed how to structure the sale process without triggering antitrust issues. The easiest solution would be a sale to foreign buyers with similar businesses, such as Turkey’s Aygaz AS or Chile’s Empresas Copec SA, sources said. Some of the Brazilian rivals that bid for the asset are still interested, such as Copagaz Distribuidora de Gas. But a sale to a Brazilian rival would be trickier, and some representatives of Brazilian companies have been lobbying Petrobras to break up the subsidiary before the sale, one of the sources said. A third option would be to require proposals that already include remedies for potential antitrust concerns. So far, no decision has been taken, the sources added. Petrobras responded to a request for comment by referring to a previous securities filing in which it said details of the deal had not been defined. Copagaz, Aygaz and Copec did not immediately comment on the matter."

Total oil equivalent production, which includes natural gas, was 2.66 million barrels per day on average last month, Petrobras said, without giving comparative figures."
-20.559401047029297," Exclusive: China nears first Americas refining capacity as CNPC, Petrobras talks mature - sources RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil’s state-run oil company is nearing a deal in which China National Petroleum Corp Ltd (CNPC) would invest in an oil refinery in exchange for crude oil, two people with knowledge of the talks told Reuters, potentially giving China its first refining capacity in the Americas. Petróleo Brasileiro SA PETR4.SA, or Petrobras, may give the state-owned Chinese firm stakes in oil fields it operates in the Campos basin, off the Rio de Janeiro coast, along with the right to use the new Comperj refinery, the sources added. “We are going to have a deal, but it is complex. We should have an integrated solution,” said one of the sources, who requested anonymity because the negotiations are private. The second source said talks with the Chinese intensified recently and a deal could be only a few weeks away. Two other people familiar with the matter said the refinery needed about $3 billion of investment to reach an initial capacity of 165,000 barrels per day, adding that it was not clear if Petrobras would foot part of the bill. Petrobras declined to comment. CNPC did not respond to a request for comment. The talks highlight rising Chinese interest in the Brazilian energy sector, which has attracted billions of dollars from oil majors over the past year for rights to new exploration blocs as the government lowers barriers to foreigners. Chinese state companies have also taken a central role in Brazil’s electric grid, acquiring rights to hydropower dams, major transmission lines and the country’s largest distributor. The Comperj deal would not be the first in which Petrobras offered oil to attract Chinese funding. In 2016, it renewed a $10 billion credit line with China Development Bank, originally opened in 2009, that was guaranteed by Brazilian oil exports. China has also provided more than $50 billion to Venezuela over the past decade under oil-for-loan agreements that helped Beijing secure energy supplies for its fast-growing economy. CNPC and Petrobras signed a memorandum of understanding last year to reach a strategic partnership in oil exploration and production. CNPC has already partnered with Petrobras in the Libra field of the Santos basin, one of the largest discoveries in Brazil’s prolific pre-salt oil area. The investment at Comperj would help to offset Brazil’s fuel imports and resolve a long-running headache at the complex, where Petrobras has little to show for some $13.5 billion in investments over the past decade. The project was caught up in a corruption probe in recent years and Petrobras has booked some 6.5 billion reais ($1.9 billion) in writedowns there linked to overpriced works and services. The company said it wants to finish Comperj, but preferably without pouring in any more money, so it is talking to potential partners. Petrobras Chief Executive Pedro Parente said last year that CNPC was in talks to invest in the refinery. On Thursday, Petrobras announced plans to sell 60 percent stakes in four of its existing refineries, underscoring its willingness to give up a near monopoly on Brazilian refining. Parente told journalists the Comperj project was not included in the plans because it is not yet a productive asset. He said negotiations for a partnership at the Comeperj refinery were still underway. Separately, Petrobras awarded a contract last month worth 1.95 billion reais to China’s Shandong Kerui Petroleum Equipment Co to build a natural gas processing unit at the Comperj complex. The privately run Kerui Group partnered with mid-sized Brazilian engineering company Método Potencial Engenharia SA to build the plant in Itaboraí, about 50 kilometers (30 miles) east of Rio."
-24.972183626443105," Petrobras gets three bids for gas pipeline network: sources SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil’s state-controlled oil company Petroleo Brasileiro SA on Thursday received three binding bids for its gas pipeline network company TAG, three sources with knowledge of the matter said. The bids were from groups led by Australia’s Macquarie Group, United Arab Emirates’ sovereign wealth fund Mubadala Development Co [MUDEV.UL] and France’s power company Engie SA, the sources said. Petrobras, which is selling 90 percent of its stake in TAG, and the bidders did not immediately comment on the matter. The sources added all bids were higher than the $5.2 billion Canada’s Brookfield Asset Management Inc paid for another gas pipeline unit sold by Petrobras, Nova Transportadora do Sudeste (NTS). Some of the proposals could be above $7 billion, the sources added. The sale of TAG is part of a program of asset sales with a $21 billion target in 2017-2018, as Petrobras seeks to reduce its $95 billion debt pile - the largest in the global oil industry Macquarie, the world’s largest manager of infrastructure investment funds, has partnered with Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, known as CPPIB, Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC Pte LTd and two Brazilian investment firms.

Petrobras, as the company is known, is considering the sale of a 60 percent stake in two blocks of refineries in the Northeastern and Southern regions. Each block would have two refineries and logistical assets, and Petrobras would keep a minority stake. The company plans to keep full ownership of nine other refining units in Brazil´s richest region, the Southeast, according to a presentation the company will show to investors at an event on Thursday. This partnership model, including the 60 percent stake sale in four refineries and keeping the other nine refineries, will leave Petrobras with a 75 percent market share of refining in Brazil, according to the presentation. The northeastern block would include refineries, pipelines and terminals in the states of Pernambuco and Bahia, while the southern block includes two units in the states of Paraná and Rio Grande do Sul. The partnership model to be presented is the result of internal discussions but no final decision has been made, and the company hopes to discuss it with private investors, the filing said."
