4.266022617937628," BHP sees robust China demand, declares dividend bonanza MELBOURNE (Reuters) - BHP Group on Tuesday reported its best first-half profit in seven years and declared a record interim dividend, as top metals user China’s strong appetite for iron ore to support its infrastructure push kept prices elevated. China’s reliance on commodity-intensive stimulus measures to sustain economic growth has sent prices of the steel making ingredient to multi-year highs, while the COVID-19 vaccination push has brightened outlook for global trade this year. The world’s largest listed miner said in a statement it expects a continuation of strong Chinese demand in 2021, and recovery in the rest of the world’s global crude steel production. “It’s a pretty solid result,” said portfolio manager Andy Forster of Argo Investments. “Relative to expectations, it looked pretty good, strong cash flows and dividend, projects operationally performing well,” he said. “Strong iron ore and copper should set it up for a pretty good second half as well.” BHP is the first of its Australian peers to report this week, with all expected to cash in on sky high prices for iron ore. Rio Tinto reports on Wednesday and Fortescue on Thursday. Last month, BHP forecast record annual iron ore output. The company declared an interim dividend of $1.01 per share, up from last year’s payout of $0.65 per share. Its underlying profit from continuing operations for the six months ended Dec. 31 rose to $6.04 billion from $5.19 billion last year. It missed a consensus of $6.33 billion, however, from 17 analysts compiled by research firm Vuma Financial. BHP acknowledged that its coal business, which is under review for sale or spin off, has taken a hit due to a trade spat between Australia and China that the miner does not expect to be resolved any time soon. “We’re certainly not banking on any near-term resetting of that policy,” Chief Executive Mike Henry told reporters on a results call. BHP is expected to make an investment decision soon on its $5.3-$5.7 billion Jansen potash project in Canada and the Scarborough natural gas project off Western Australia, in which BHP will invest $1.4-1.9 billion. Jefferies expects both to be approved, “but we believe M&A options will be considered as well,” it said in a report."
4.266022617937628," Breakingviews - BHP boss gets extended Chinese honeymoon MELBOURNE (Reuters Breakingviews) - Mike Henry can celebrate an unexpectedly happy anniversary. He became chief executive of Australian mining giant BHP just in time for Covid-19. Higher iron ore prices driven by Chinese demand, however, have just helped pay for a record $5.1 billion dividend. They also buy him extra time to grapple with difficult strategic decisions. The smooth leadership transition last year quickly took a rocky turn. Bracing for a global economic slowdown and keeping workers safe from the virus became more pressing than operational efficiency or expansion. Along with $6 billion of underlying profit for the six months to Dec. 31 unveiled on Tuesday came $440 million of pandemic-related costs. China’s quick rebound helped ease Henry’s plight. Construction stimulus combined with hobbled Brazilian supplies drove up the price of iron ore. For BHP, every extra $1 per tonne on the market price of the steelmaking ingredient equals some $240 million of EBITDA. And the average price realised was almost $104 for the six-month stretch, a full 33% higher than a year earlier, more than making up for lower oil and coal prices. There’s probably more to come. BHP expects China to churn out 1 billion tonnes of steel in 2021 for a third consecutive year, and iron ore is selling at more than $160. With the rest of the world also recovering, governments and companies could take advantage of ultra-low interest rates to invest. Henry even considers the transition from fossil fuel to renewable energy an opportunity to sell more iron ore despite the harmful impact it will have on his company longer term. These trends, and the hefty payouts they enable, have given Henry wiggle room to consider a hefty investment into the Jansen potash project. The abundant cash could make it an easier sell to shareholders. He can also delay buying copper and nickel assets, which are inflated. And it means the sticky question of BHP’s dual-listing structure can stay on the back burner for longer. Moreover, there’s less intense pressure to find new customers following Beijing’s ban on Australian coal, which is likely to stay in place for some time. In that sense, Henry will get an extended honeymoon."
4.266022617937628," BHP says expanded Spence mine in Chile to hit full production within 12 months SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Global miner BHP said on Monday it expected to hit full capacity production following the expansion of its Spence copper mine within 12 months and be producing 300,000 tonnes per year up until at least 2026. BHP has built a new, $2.46 billion concentrator plant that can process 95,000 tonnes of raw material per day, extending the useful life of facility in northern Chile by more than 50 years. “We expect the first copper sales from the new Spence concentrator during the first quarter of 2021,” the company said in a statement accompanying financial results. BHP said production from Escondida, the world’s largest copper deposit, had fallen 5% in the second half of 2020 due to a decline in ore grades and lower cathode production. The company said that workforce cuts necessitated by the outbreak of the coronavirus in Chile meant it had given priority to producing copper concentrate over cathodes, with an associated drop of 30,000 tonnes in cathode production."
15.785710235946434," BHP partners with JFE Steel to study cutting carbon from steel-making LONDON (Reuters) - BHP Group said on Wednesday it would invest up to $15 million over five years as part of a deal with Japan’s JFE Steel to look at technologies and other ways to lower emissions from the steel-making process. BHP is the world’s biggest listed miner and biggest coking coal producer. Combined with iron ore, also mined by BHP, coking coal is used to make steel, producing millions of tonnes of CO2. The investment is part of BHP’s $400 million fund for reducing emissions, as investor pressure builds on mining companies to find more sustainable ways to operate. Under the partnership with JFE Steel, owned by JFE Holdings, studies will be conducted on how the properties of raw materials from Australia can help lower emissions and increase efficiencies from the blast furnace. “Throughout the collaboration the two companies will also share knowledge on reducing carbon emissions across the steel value chain,” a statement from BHP said. The miner last year inked a $35 million deal with China Baowu to address climate change issues and awarded a tender to Eastern Pacific Shipping to charter five bulk iron ore carriers powered by liquefied natural gas (LNG), a cleaner alternative to normal ship fuel. BHP has pledged to cut carbon emission by 30% by 2030 while JFE Steel, Japan’s second-biggest steelmaker, aims to lower its own emissions by more than 20% by 2030."
-1.5836465180148922," UPDATE 1-Doubts cloud BHP's Cerro Colorado mine after Chilean court ruling (Adds statement from BHP) SANTIAGO, Jan 14 (Reuters) - The operations of global miner BHP’s Cerro Colorado copper mine in water-parched northern Chile have been thrown into doubt after the country’s Supreme Court upheld local indigenous communities’ complaint about the project’s water use. The court ruled late on Wednesday night that a routine evaluation of the mine’s environmental project, including by a committee of ministers, failed to take into account warnings by locals that its operations were overdrawing water and impacting local wetlands. It said the complaint, filed by the San Isidro de Quipisca Indigenous Agricultural Association against the environmental approval granted on Nov. 12, 2016, was upheld. Cerro Colorado, a small mine in BHP’s Chilean portfolio, produced about 1.2% of Chile’s total copper output in 2019. The country is the largest copper producer in the world. Lawyers acting for the indigenous group said the mine would have to suspend while a fresh environmental review already underway is completed. BHP, however, said the mine could continue to operate while the review was conducted based on the terms of an earlier finding on the same dispute by the Environmental Court. “Cerro Colorado is already working on the compliance with the measures required by the Environmental Court before the Environmental Evaluation Service (SEA) and ... reaffirms its willingness to establish dialogue processes based on respect, good faith and the principles of BHP’s Indigenous Peoples Plan,” the company said in a statement. Lorenzo Soto, a lawyer for the indigenous group, told Reuters on Thursday that water pumping to feed Cerro Colorado’s operations had almost entirely dried out high-altitude wetlands around its operations in the Tarapaca region. “We have been raising this for several years,” he said. “The surrounding communities are victims of dust and noise emissions, and any water they have is contaminated.” He said the Supreme Court ruling was the culmination of a five-year legal battle. “Cerro Colorado’s environmental operating permit is annulled and, that permit being annulled, the company must stop,” he said.

-3.035660264574738," UPDATE 1-UK shareholder raises concerns over Rio/BHP Arizona mine (Adds response from Rio Tinto and BHP) LONDON/HOUSTON, Jan 8 (Reuters) - A leading British local government pension group has urged mining giants Rio Tinto and BHP to clarify how they intend to protect the environment in and around an Arizona copper project that is opposed by many Native American tribes. The Local Authority Pension Fund Forum (LAPFF), a shareholder in both firms, said this week that it had written to them to ask how the U.S. project, which could be approved within days, will affect local communities, as Native American tribes say it could destroy cultural and religious sites. Clashes are becoming more frequent between indigenous groups and mining companies eager to produce more copper for electric vehicles and other green technologies. Rio Tinto and BHP, via their subsidiary Resolution Copper Co, have sought for years to access the copper deposit in Arizona. A land swap, proposed in 2015, is now expected to be approved by the outgoing U.S. administration, which is moving to loosen mining regulations before leaving office on Jan. 20. Rio Tinto, which is the project’s majority owner and operator, said the land swap would be “just one step in an ongoing permitting and feasibility study process over coming years, before any decision on investment to proceed”. The company sent a letter to Native American tribal leaders last month in which it committed to working with tribal groups and seeking their consent. BHP, as a minority partner, declined to comment. The underground copper deposit in the Tonto National Forest abuts the San Carlos and Fort Apache Indian reservation, which the local tribes consider the home of religious deities and where they hold tribal ceremonies. LAPFF, whose member schemes manage more than 300 billion pounds ($400 billion) in assets, has direct holdings in both Rio Tinto and BHP. It opposes the use of block caving, expected to be the method chosen for the project, its chairman Doug McMurdo told Reuters. In block caving, a large section of rock is undercut to create an artificial cave that collapses under the weight of the rock above. “Over the past couple of years, LAPFF has engaged extensively with communities affected by mining operations in Brazil, Australia, and the U.S.,” McMurdo said in a statement. “These engagements have revealed troubling patterns of mining companies failing to incorporate community voice adequately into decision-making processes.” LAPFF is in contact with other pension funds and shareholders of the mining companies. The destruction of Australia’s 46,000-year-old Juukan Gorge rock shelters by Rio Tinto last year sparked public and investor uproar that ultimately led to the resignation of its chief executive and two deputies.

2.8950207021950654," BHP restarts operations at Samarco five years after Brazil dam disaster (Reuters) - BHP Group Ltd said on Thursday it had met licensing requirements to restart operations and had begun iron ore pellet production at its Samarco joint venture with Brazil’s Vale SA, five years after a deadly dam disaster. The restart of iron ore mining comes just as prices of the commodity have soared in recent weeks on expectation of bullish demand in 2021, as top consumer China further recovers from the coronavirus while a Brazilian supply shortfall persists. Independent tests had been carried out on Samarco’s preparations for a safe restart and operations are expected initially to produce about 8 million tonnes of iron ore pellets per annum, the miner said. In the 2015 incident, a mining waste dam burst at Samarco’s site in the town of Mariana, releasing a torrent of sludge that killed 19 people and leading to the suspension of operations and multiple legal cases against the miners. The collapse is considered Brazil’s worst-ever environmental disaster, contaminating a river for hundreds of miles to the ocean. Brazilian federal prosecutors filed a lawsuit in October contesting the miners’ compensation package for victims, arguing that the package is far too low."

30.218236705498285," English judge blocks $6.6 billion Brazil lawsuit against BHP over burst dam LONDON (Reuters) - A 5.0 billion pound ($6.6 billion) English lawsuit against Anglo-Australian mining giant BHP BHPB.LBHP.AX has been struck out, in a blow to a 200,000-strong Brazilian claimant group seeking damages after a devastating dam failure in 2015. A High Court judge in Manchester ruled that managing the largest group claim in English legal history would be like “trying to build a house of cards in a wind tunnel” and the case was an “abuse of the process of the court”. BHP welcomed the decision, which it said reinforced its view that victims should pursue claims in Brazil and that the case duplicated ongoing work and legal proceedings there. Tom Goodhead, a lawyer at PGMBM representing the claimants, called the judgment “fundamentally flawed” and vowed to appeal. “We will continue to fight ceaselessly, for however long it takes, in any court in the world, to ensure that BHP are held accountable for their actions,” he said. The collapse of the Fundao dam, which is owned by the Samarco joint venture between BHP and Brazilian iron ore mining giant Vale VALE3.SA, killed 19 and sent a torrent of mining waste into communities, the Doce river, and the Atlantic Ocean, 650 kilometres (400 miles) away. It was Brazil's worst environmental disaster. The case is the latest battle to establish whether multinationals can be held liable for the conduct of subsidiaries abroad. The ruling comes about 18 months after the UK Supreme Court ruled that nearly 2,000 Zambian villagers could sue miner Vedanta in England for alleged pollution in Africa because substantial justice was not obtainable in Zambia. Leigh Day partner Martyn Day, who represented the Zambian villagers, said he took his hat off to the Brazilian claimants’ legal team for “having the guts” to take on the vast case. “The judge seems to me to have been tough on the claimants,” he said. “The question for the appeal court will be whether or not he was too tough.” Claimants alleged senior BHP executives sat on Samarco’s board, that BHP representatives approved of plans to repeatedly ramp up the dam’s capacity, ignoring safety warnings, and that victims have no prospect of proper compensation in Brazil within a reasonable timeframe. Lawyers for the claimants, who include municipalities, indigenous people, businesses and churches, also argued that under Brazilian law, liability for environmental damage could be imposed on a defendant’s ultimate owner. BHP says it and Vale each poured about $1.7 billion into the Renova Foundation, set up in 2016 by BHP’s Brazilian division, Samarco and Vale to manage 42 reparation projects, including providing financial aid to indigenous families, rebuilding villages and establishing new water supply systems."

Under the programme, copper producers will be assessed by an independent body against a set of “responsible production criteria” in line with the United Nations sustainable development goals, according to Copper Mark. BHP-operated copper assets in Escondida and Spence in Chile, and Olympic Dam in Australia, will be the ones undergoing the assessment, the global miner said in a statement. The pledge adds to BHP’s environmental goals announced in September that included reducing operational emissions by 30% by the 2030 financial year from 2020 levels. BHP added it believes the program will help to hold the copper industry accountable in areas such as environment, community, human rights and governance issues.

As the world grapples with the fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic, major miners are hoping Beijing’s commodity-intensive stimulus measures will deliver an economic rebound for China. The world’s largest listed miner produced 74 million tonnes (Mt) of Western Australia Iron Ore in the three months ended Sept. 30, up from 69 Mt a year earlier and slightly above a UBS estimate of 73.5 Mt. BHP said, however, that December quarter iron ore production will be affected by work linking its Mining Area C and South Flank projects in Western Australia. Its full-year forecast of 276 milllion – 286 million tonnes was kept unchanged. “BHP’s projects are on track, and the company is securing growth options in copper and nickel. No major surprises in this report. Reiterate Buy,” broker Jefferies said in a note. For copper, BHP’s $2.46 billion Spence expansion in Chile is on track for first production in the January quarter but a $2.5 billion expansion project at South Australia’s Olympic Dam has been canned after extended drilling showed it would not be economic.

27.26917802882742," Brazil seeks to re-open $27 billion lawsuit against BHP, Vale SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian federal and state prosecutors have asked a court to re-open a multi-billion-dollar civil action lawsuit against miners Samarco, Vale SA and BHP for damages caused by the Fundao dam burst in 2015, authorities said on Thursday. The incident at Samarco’s Mariana facilities, a joint venture between Vale and BHP, which left 19 dead and polluted the River Doce, was Brazil’s biggest ever environmental disaster. The claim is for damages of 155 billion reais ($27.4 billion). The suit had been suspended in 2018 after an agreement between prosecutors and the companies. But in the Thursday statement, state prosecutors in Minas Gerais, where Mariana is located, alleged that the companies were not meeting their obligations in a timely fashion. In a joint statement, Vale, Samarco and BHP said they were surprised by prosecutors’ decision to attempt to re-open the suit, and said they vehemently disagreed with the assertion that they were not complying with their obligations promptly. They said the existing agreement allowed for full reparations for all parties affected by the dam break. Another mining dam owned by Vale burst in Minas Gerais in 2019, an incident which killed 270 people and sparked a series of criminal and civil suits. Earlier on Thursday, Vale said that 33 of its 104 dam structures in Brazil had failed their stability assessments."

3.713941468664477," BHP to tap green energy to mine coal in Australian state MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Global miner BHP Group BHP.AX said on Tuesday it has signed an agreement to use more renewable energy at its coal mines in Australia's Queensland state which it expects will help it cut its indirect emissions such as those from fuel and power in the country by 20% in five years. The move comes as BHP prepares to update the market on its climate actions next week which will include targets to cut operational emissions by 2030, as part of its broader commitment to reach net zero emissions by 2050. The steel-making coal that BHP digs out of the Bowen Basin in central Queensland will be exported and does not count towards BHP’s net zero target. “This is an important step forward in BHP’s transition to more sustainable energy use across our portfolio, and a first for our Australian operations,” said BHP’s President Minerals Australia Edgar Basto said in a statement. BHP produced 41 million tonnes of the steel-making ingredient last year. The renewable power purchasing agreement with Queensland’s state-owned clean energy generator CleanCo, will run for five years from Jan. 1 2021. Long-term power purchasing agreements improve the viability of large renewables projects because they guarantee a source of income, making projects easier for banks to finance. The agreement will support the development of new solar and wind farms in Queensland – the Western Downs Green Power Hub due for completion in late 2022, and Karara Wind Farm due for completion in early 2023. For the first two years, power will be contracted from CleanCo’s low emissions portfolio which includes hydro and gas generation assets, before the new projects ramp up. BHP Group produced 3.5 million tonnes of direct greenhouse gas emissions and 1.37 million tonnes of indirect emissions in 2018-2019, making it among the country’s largest emitters, according to the Clean Energy Regulator. Australian corporations reported 338 million tonnes of direct greenhouse gas emissions and 88 million tonnes of indirect emissions that year, the regulator said."

-1.7428080905885226," Column: BHP and Rio show the swings and arrows of China commodity exposure - Russell LAUNCESTON, Australia (Reuters) - It may be a bit of an oversimplification, but in the current situation of the global coronavirus pandemic the world of commodities is effectively split between China and the rest. Nowhere is this more clearly illustrated than in the results of top global miners BHP Group and Rio Tinto. BHP, the world’s biggest miner with a broad portfolio of quality assets, missed analysts’ estimates in reporting a 4% drop in annual profits on Aug. 18. BHP reported underlying profit attributable from continuing operations for the year ended June 30 of $9.06 billion - below estimates of $9.42 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data. “With the exception of China, the world’s major economies will contract during the 2020 calendar year as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,” Chief Executive Mike Henry said in a statement. Looking at the details of BHP’s results shows that the standout performer was iron ore, providing 64% of the earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) for the world’s third-largest producer of the steel-making ingredient. China buys more than two-thirds of the global seaborne trade in iron ore, making it the major commodity most exposed to the Chinese economy. It’s also worth noting that BHP’s return on capital employed was 56% for iron ore, but only 12% for metallurgical coal, 7% for copper and 6% for petroleum. While China has been boosting imports of most major commodities as its economy recovers from the coronavirus shutdowns of the first quarter, it’s iron ore that has been the biggest beneficiary. Spot 62% iron ore for delivery to north China, as assessed by commodity price reporting agency Argus, rose to a 6 1/2-year high of $128.20 a tonne on Wednesday. It is now up 62% from its low so far this year of $79.60 on March 23, and 41% from the end of last year. This makes iron ore the best performing major commodity, leaving behind even the market darling gold, which had gained 27% from the end of last year to its close of $1,929.54 an ounce on Wednesday. It’s therefore little surprise that Rio Tinto, which is poised to overtake Brazil’s Vale as the world’s top iron ore miner, performed so strongly it its first-half results, announced on July 29. The Anglo-Australian miner reported underlying half-year earnings of $4.75 billion, beating the analysts’ consensus forecast of $4.36 billion. Unsurprisingly, Chief Executive Jean-Sébastien Jacques was talking up China’s V-shaped economic recovery. “We believe that China has enjoyed a very steep V-shaped recovery. Today we see it as that the demand for steel and iron ore in China is very, very strong and order books are full,” Jacques said. The risk for Rio is that it becomes a one-trick pony, as iron ore accounted for 96% of its underlying earnings in the first half. Rio is also a major producer of copper, aluminium, diamonds and uranium, but in the current environment, these assets may as well not be there, at least from a profit-contributing perspective. Rio’s return on capital employed was 64% for iron ore, 3% for aluminium, 1% on copper and diamonds and 10% for what it calls its energy and minerals, which includes uranium, iron ore pellets and borates. However, while it’s clear that Rio is heavily dependent on iron ore, this will likely work in its favour for as long as China’s economy is surging, while the rest of the world is still battling to control the pandemic. Rio’s first half average price for iron ore was $85.10 a tonne, and the company said that for every 10% change in prices, it would gain, or lose, $1.892 billion. Given that the spot iron ore price has been above $100 a tonne since July 3, Rio stands to rake in billions more in the second half, even if the price doesn’t hold around current levels and eases somewhat as more supply from Brazil returns to the market. For BHP the outlook is trickier. BHP’s more diversified portfolio should stand it in good stead if the rest of the global economy performs better in 2021, based on the assumption that the coronavirus can be contained, or neutralised by a vaccine.

-2.94689279040252," BHP falls short of expected profit, warns of slowing growth outside China MELBOURNE/BENGALURU (Reuters) - BHP Group on Tuesday said it expects most major world economies except China to bear the brunt of a coronavirus-led downturn this year, reporting a 4% drop in annual profit that missed analysts’ estimates. While miners have seen green shoots emerge from an economic pickup in the world’s top metals user, as well as a boost in infrastructure spending, the risk of new virus outbreaks around the world threatens to undermine growth, BHP said. The warning came as BHP reported underlying profit attributable from continuing operations for the year ended June 30 that fell to $9.06 billion - below estimates of $9.42 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data. “With the exception of China, the world’s major economies will contract during the 2020 calendar year as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic,” Chief Executive Mike Henry said in a statement. Henry added that the potential for fresh waves of coronavirus infections in key markets was weighing on the demand outlook for 2021 at the world’s largest listed miner. “Not too many surprises in there,” said portfolio manager Andy Forster of Argo Investments in Sydney. “Maybe a touch under expected, and the dividend a bit below.” Shares fell by as much as 1.3% before trimming the drop to 0.3% at A$39.75, by 0203 GMT, compared with a 1% rise in the broader index The profit miss was in contrast to rival Rio Tinto, which last month rode its iron ore-rich portfolio to beat profit estimates and touted “a very steep V-shaped” recovery in China. It declared a final dividend of 55 cents per share, down from 78 cents a year earlier, but still in line with its payout ratio. BHP also announced asset divestments and executive leadership changes - that will see top management evenly split by gender - as Henry, who officially took the reins in January, puts his stamp on the business. The miner said it is looking at options including a demerger or sale of thermal coal assets, as it favours energy-rich metallurgical coal in its portfolio given a lower-carbon future. These include its Australian Mount Arthur operations, 80% of its BHP Mitsui Coal joint venture, and one-third of the Cerrejón mine in Colombia. Japanese trading house Mitsui had no immediate comment. It also said it was looking to sell off its Bass Strait oil and gas stake, though that was not down to any environmental agenda, Henry told an analyst call. He said BHP was bullish on oil because it has profitable prospects for at least the next decade and is open to acquisitions near existing assets."
-4.409142049049204," Breakingviews - BHP selfishly brushes up green credentials HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - BHP is brushing up its green credentials, albeit for selfish reasons. Surging iron ore sales cushioned declines in other commodities, as underlying earnings attributable to continuing operations fell 4% to $9.1 billion for the fiscal year. Boss Mike Henry plans to ditch some high-polluting energy assets, though for economic, not for environmental, motives. It still makes strategic sense. Voracious Chinese demand for iron ore continued to power earnings at the world’s largest listed miner. Underlying EBITDA for the key steel-making ingredient jumped by more than 30% to $14.6 billion in the year to June, making up two-thirds of BHP’s total. That’s in sharp contrast to the Anglo-Australian group’s other businesses, which all contracted on the back of weak prices. Henry, who took the helm of the $135 billion company at the start of this year, announced long-anticipated plans to divest thermal coal operations, following a similar exit by rival Rio Tinto in 2018. The division is relatively small, but as one of the most polluting fuel categories, getting energy coal off the books should please investors seeking a more environmentally sustainable BHP. The chief executive will put a stake in the Australian Bass Strait petroleum venture up for sale as well. There are caveats. Thermal coal represents just a fraction of the company’s total assets and has financially underperformed, so the sale does not necessarily represent the attitude shift climate activists hoped for. Although Bass Strait accounted for over a third of total petroleum EBITDA, the venture is one of BHP’s oldest assets and has probably peaked. Moreover, the company will keep investing in other oil and gas projects. Even so, the company will update its emissions reduction targets next month, and has been open about its sustainability plans. There’s also money to be made by shifting its portfolio to metals like copper and nickel used in electric vehicles and renewable technologies, for example. Asset managers like BlackRock are also putting increasing emphasis on environmental, social and governance standards. Indeed, analysts at Deutsche Bank recently downgraded BHP’s stock largely due to its heavy exposure to fossil fuels. Shareholders will benefit from a slightly cleaner BHP."
-5.240156604462991," BHP to steer mining lobby groups' climate change policies MELBOURNE (Reuters) - BHP Group BHP.AX said on Friday it will closely monitor the work of industry associations to ensure they match its climate position on keeping the world's warming to less than 2 degrees Celsius. The world’s largest listed miner has faced increasing pressure from investors worried that some mineral lobby groups, particularly in Australia, are promoting coal in contravention of the goals of the Paris climate pact, and have urged BHP to stop funding them. BHP, which quit the World Coal Association in 2018, said it will publish annually a list of material association memberships and disclose in real time if any of the associations breach its global climate policy standards. “We welcome this effort to ensure trade associations remain in step with their more forward-thinking members,” said Thomas O’Malley, Global Head of Corporate Governance at HSBC Global Asset Management and co-lead of the Climate Action 100+ engagement with BHP. BHP also said industry groups it supports should not advocate in favour of Australia’s use of Kyoto carryover credits, a controversial accounting method that would allow Australia to use its old carbon credits from the 1992 Kyoto Protocol to meet Paris targets. Last year, BHP said it was reviewing its membership of four industry associations including the New South Wales Minerals Council due to concerns about their climate and energy policies. The NSW Minerals Council in June promoted 21 coal mines as a key employment driver. It said in a statement that its policies reflected the views of all members. “BHP is an important member... and we will seek to progress BHP’s request in consultation with our board and the executive committee which includes BHP.” The Minerals Council of Australia said it welcomed BHP’s findings and would work with the miner and state associations to progress the key issues raised."

The proposal comes before BHP’s financial results, due out next week, and after a government enquiry into how peer Rio Tinto legally destroyed caves that showed human habitation stretching back 46,000 years, as part of an iron ore mine expansion. The moratorium on damaging culturally important sites would cut risk while reforms are considered, the shareholder group, the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR), said in a statement. “Investors simply can’t stand by and allow another Juukan Gorge disaster to take place,” said the group’s executive director, Brynn O’Brien, referring to the site of the caves destroyed by Rio Tinto. The group is aligned with industry funds that pledge to uphold socially responsible investment. The resolution is backed by a group representing all of Australia’s major Aboriginal Land Councils. BHP said it consulted regularly with its investors on matters such as its approach to cultural heritage. “Our engagement with Traditional Owners is based on deep respect and a commitment to understanding the cultural significance of their country and heritage,” the company said in a statement. A proposed revision of Western Australia’s Aboriginal Heritage Act is to be made public in coming weeks. The law is widely considered out of date because it does not allow traditional owners right of appeal, among other issues. BHP has said it would not disturb any sites of importance to the Banjima people at its South Flank operations, even though the state government had given it approval to disturb 40 sites. The ACCR also called on BHP to lift gag orders that restrain Indigenous groups from objecting to developments on their land and to be transparent when it comes to lobbying by industry groups. In a separate resolution, the ACCR called for BHP to review the work of its industry associations in connection with economic stimulus measures in response to the novel coronavirus, and how that relates to their Paris climate accord commitments. The New South Wales Minerals Council in July called for the state government to fast-track approval of 21 new or expanded coal mining projects."

BHP, like other mining companies in Chile, has been migrating its energy contracts to renewable sources to reduce its carbon footprint. In a letter to the local securities regulator on Friday night, power company AES Gener - a unit of AES Corp - said that the end of the agreement signed with its Angamos plant was modified to August 2021. The coal-burning contracts had been scheduled to end in 2026 at Spence and 2029 at Escondida. “The agreements are subject to certain resolution conditions which, if any one of them is met, no later than August 31, 2020,” said AES Gener. Escondida, the world’s largest copper mine, will have to disburse $730 million in nine installments from August 2021 and Spence $109.6 million at the end of August this year."

Mario Antonio Coelho, mayor of Brazil’s Barra Longa municipality, told a jurisdictional hearing in Manchester that bringing the 5 billion pound ($6.3 billion) case in England over Brazil’s worst environmental disaster is the only route to proper justice, court documents show. Duarte Junior, the mayor of Mariana, who has travelled to Manchester, northern England, with Rio Doce’s mayor Silverio da Luz, urged BHP to listen to Brazilians. “Since BHP went to Brazil and did not respect our rights, we came to England and our rights will be respected here,” he told Reuters in an email. BHP has called for the lawsuit, which is the largest group action in English legal history, to be struck out or suspended, alleging it duplicates Brazilian proceedings and that victims are receiving - or will receive - full redress. The world’s largest miner by market value last week labelled the English legal action pointless and wasteful. But representing the claimants, lawyer Charles Hollander told the court on Monday there “is virtually nil chance of there ever being a trial” in relation to a 155 billion reais ($30 billion) class action filed by federal prosecutors in Brazil. The collapse of the Fundao tailings dam, which stored mining waste and is owned by the Samarco joint venture between BHP and Brazilian iron ore mining company Vale, killed 19 and poured roughly 40 million cubic metres of sludge into communities, the Rio Doce river and Atlantic Ocean 650 km away. Coelho said the disaster had decimated the local economy, choking the district in sludge and dust and leaving the town “at the mercy” of the Renova Foundation, an entity created by the miner and its partners to manage repairs and reparations. He alleged Renova dumped 30,000 tonnes of waste in an area inhabited by poorer Afro-Brazilians and used it as building material to reconstruct areas such as the main square, giving it an “unmistakable stench” and stoking anguish over conflicting information about health risks. Claimants allege BHP ignored safety warnings as the dam’s capacity was repeatedly increased by raising its height, disregarding cracks that pointed to early signs of rupture, and that compensation for victims has been inadequate. Da Luz said a hydroelectric plant - a major regional source of revenue - is paralysed and the “vast majority” of mining waste remains in the water. “To this day, no-one can fish in the river, nor can we use the river for recreational purposes as we used to,” he said in a witness statement. Indigenous Krenak and Guarani people have also told Reuters they now fear the rivers.

Kicking off an eight-day hearing in Manchester, northern England, BHP BHPB.LBHP.AX on Wednesday called for the record group action to be struck out or suspended, alleging it duplicated Brazilian proceedings and victims were already receiving redress. “...the attempt to export and duplicate the work being done in Brazil, including the litigation, to England, is pointless and wasteful,” BHP said in legal documents. The claimants are due to lay out their arguments on Monday in the latest jurisdictional battle to establish whether London-listed multinationals can face trial in England over the actions of their foreign divisions. Charles Gibson, a lawyer for BHP, told the court Brazil had a sophisticated and fair justice system that provided access to timely justice. “One has to be quite cautious before casting stones at other systems of justice,” he said. The judge is expected to reserve judgment until around September. If shown the green light, further trials could determine liability and quantify damages. The collapse of the Fundao dam, which stored mining waste and is owned by the Samarco joint venture between BHP and Brazilian iron ore mining giant Vale VALE3.SA, killed 19 and poured roughly 40 million cubic metres of mining waste into communities, the Rio Doce river and Atlantic Ocean, 650 km away. Claimants allege BHP, the world’s largest miner by market value, ignored safety warnings as the dam’s capacity was repeatedly increased by raising its height - and disregarded cracks that were early signs of rupture. Many claimants are seeking compensation for physical and psychological injury, property damage, moving costs, loss of earnings, loss of water supply and lost fishing income. BHP says the Renova Foundation, a redress scheme established in 2016 by its Brazilian division, Samarco and Vale, has spent around 1.3 billion pounds on projects such as monthly financial aid to about 130 indigenous Krenak families, rebuilding three villages and establishing alternative water supply systems. It also alleges almost 100,000 of the claimants have already received payments from Renova and only 58 of the individuals, businesses, municipalities, churches, utility companies and indigenous people bringing the claim in England are not part of Brazilian class actions. Claimants allege it is wrong to suggest victims are entitled to full redress in Brazil because Renova lacks independence and its compensation scheme is slow, bureaucratic, inadequate and has not properly involved victims in decision-making. They allege BHP is responsible for the dam’s collapse, liable for its “catastrophic consequences” under Brazilian law but that victims have no prospect of proper compensation in Brazil within any reasonable timeframe. Samarco, Vale and BHP Brasil face a raft of lawsuits in Brazil over the disaster, including a 155 billion reais ($29 billion) class action filed by federal prosecutors which, BHP alleges, overlaps “almost entirely” with the English case. The Brazilian class action has been suspended, although the parties aim to negotiate a settlement by around August 2022."

Claimants allege BHP, the world’s largest miner by market value, ignored safety warnings as the dam’s capacity was repeatedly increased by raising its height - and disregarded cracks that were early signs of rupture. Many claimants are seeking compensation for physical and psychological injury, property damage, moving costs, loss of earnings, loss of water supply and lost fishing income. BHP said the Renova Foundation, a redress scheme set up in 2016 by its Brazilian division, Samarco and Vale, has spent more than 1.3 billion pounds on projects, such as monthly financial aid to about 130 indigenous Krenak families, rebuilding three villages and establishing alternative water supply systems. It also alleged almost 100,000 of the claimants have already received payments from Renova and only 58 of the individuals, businesses, municipalities, churches, utility companies and indigenous people bringing the claim in England are not part of rival class actions in Brazil. Claimants allege it is wrong to suggest victims are entitled to full redress in Brazil because Renova lacks independence and its compensation scheme is slow, bureaucratic, inadequate and has not properly involved victims in decision-making. They allege BHP is responsible for the dam’s collapse, liable for its “catastrophic consequences” under Brazilian law but that victims have no prospect of proper compensation in Brazil within any reasonable timeframe. Samarco, Vale and BHP Brasil face a raft of lawsuits in Brazil over the disaster, including a 155 billion reais ($29 billion) class action filed by Brazil’s federal prosecutors which, it alleges, overlaps “almost entirely” with the English case. The Brazilian class action has been suspended, although the parties plan to negotiate a settlement by 2022 at the latest. ($1 = 0.7942 pounds)"
-1.7783250137563016," BHP hits record iron ore output but warns of risks from virus MELBOURNE (Reuters) - BHP Group on Tuesday posted a 7% rise in fourth-quarter iron ore output, but warned the resurgence of COVID-19 outbreaks threatened the short-term demand outlook for its key commodities and widened its production guidance range for next year. Mining companies are banking on the recent uptick in industrial activity in China, the world’s top metals consumer, to support prices and insulate them from uncertainty over demand elsewhere, as global coronavirus cases continue to spike. The world’s biggest listed miner met guidance for its iron ore production of a record 67 million tonnes for the quarter, up 4%, and 248 million tonnes for the financial year, reflecting strong demand from top consumer China. Reflecting uncertainty over a second wave of infections and the possible impact to demand from China, the world’ stop commodity consumer, it also widened its 2021 guidance across commodities, including 2% each way for iron ore to 244 – 253 million tonnes for FY 2021. “BHP’s 4Q FY20 production was stronger than we had expected as we had modelled more significant disruptions from COVID and weak demand,” said broker Jefferies in a report. China’s domestic industrial activity had been improving, BHP said, given supportive credit and fiscal policy, but it reiterated a major risk to maintaining that positive trajectory due to a possible emergence of a second wave of infections. “Indications are that the U.S., India, Japan and Europe will all experience a flatter recovery trajectory than China. Negative feedback loops to China from the downturn in the rest of the world are factored into our range analysis.” Last week, rival Rio Tinto stuck to its 2020 iron ore shipment forecast and sounded markedly more upbeat, saying demand for the steelmaking ingredient was improving in China. BHP produced 414,000 tonnes of copper in the quarter, ahead of UBS expectations of 388,000 tonnes, hitting 1.724 million tonnes for the year. It lowered its 2021 guidance to 1.48–1.645 million tonnes, down by 14%–5% from its 2020 outlook given coronavirus impacts in Latin America."

The group claim, one of the largest in British legal history, has been brought on behalf of Brazilian individuals, businesses, churches, organisations, municipalities and indigenous people and will open in Manchester on July 22. An initial, eight-day hearing will establish whether the case can be heard in Britain, although the judge is expected to reserve judgment until later in the year. If successful, further trials are expected to determine liability and quantify damages. BHP spokesman Neil Burrows said the claim did not belong in Britain because it duplicated proceedings in Brazil and the ongoing work of the Renova Foundation, an entity created by the miner and its partners to manage reparations and repairs. The collapse of the Fundao tailings dam, which stored mining waste and is owned by the Samarco joint venture between BHP and Brazilian iron ore mining company Vale, killed 19 and spilled roughly 40 million cubic metres of toxic sludge into communities, the Rio Doce river and Atlantic Ocean 650 km away. Claimants allege BHP, the world’s largest miner by market value, ignored safety warnings as the dam’s capacity was repeatedly increased by raising its height - and disregarded cracks that pointed to early signs of rupture. “The public companies at the top of the BHP group structure, which we firmly believe bear ultimate responsibility for the disaster, have until now been insulated from its consequences within the Brazilian legal system,” said Tom Goodhead, a partner at law firm PGMBM, which represents the claimants. Goodhead said Brazilian environmental law had a long reach and imposed strict liability for environmental damage."

Cornerstone has an 8% stake in SolGold, making it the BHP-backed company's BHP.AXBHPB.L fourth-biggest shareholder. “The current SolGold Board is incapable of managing the affairs of SolGold for the benefit of all shareholders in a prudent and transparent manner,” said Greg Chamandy, chairman of Cornerstone, in a statement. At the centre of SolGold’s public spat with two of its largest shareholders are concerns it is raising money for its mammoth Ecuador copper-gold project using inefficient and expensive methods. In May, SolGold announced a financing package of up to $150 million and a $15 million bridge loan with mining financiers Franco-Nevada Corp FNV.TO to develop its Alpala project. Cornerstone's Chamandy said the proposed royalty financing would destroy value for all SolGold shareholders, echoing comments by SolGold's second largest investor Newcrest NCM.AX Cornerstone said it expected a new SolGold board to review the terms of the Franco-Nevada financing package and possibly terminate the deal if it was not in the best interests of SolGold and its shareholders. SolGold CEO Nick Mather said the call to remove the company’s board was “unnecessarily destabilising”, adding he was not sure of the motivation but was “confident of defending such an attack”. He was speaking on a webinar to try to convince Cornerstone shareholders to take an all-stock offer made in late June of 11 SolGold ordinary shares for each Cornerstone share. An earlier proposal was also rejected by Cornerstone in 2019 on the grounds that it undervalued the Canadian company. Mather urged Cornerstone shareholders to “accept the premium bid”. He added the Franco-Nevada deal was on favourable terms and was fair for all shareholders. Franco-Nevada declined to comment. Cornerstone said on Tuesday about 65% of its shareholders would not support SolGold’s second offer. Shares in SolGold were up 4% by 1425 GMT."

Cerro Colorado produced 71,700 tonnes of copper in 2019, or approximately 1.2% of Chile´s total. BHP said the mine´s environmental permits were I “This measure is necessary to maintain a viable operation during the years that remain... which will be marked by high uncertainty and financial volatility,” the company said in a statement. BHP said the new plan would mean a gradual reduction in staff that would begin this year and span the coming four months. The company said it would nonetheless continue “looking for medium and long-term alternatives that would allow it to extend its mining operation beyond 2023.” The mine, which operates in a water-parched region of northern Chile, is seeking to replace its use of groundwater with desalinated sea water from the nearby Pacific. BHP also operates the sprawling Escondida copper mine in Chile, the world´s largest, as well as the nearby Spence copper mine."

10.922674363485061," BHP puts Australian thermal coal mine up for sale: sources LONDON/MELBOURNE (Reuters) - The world’s largest mining company BHP Group has hired Macquarie Bank and JP Morgan to sell its Australian thermal coal mine, three sources said, as miners face increasing pressure to reduce their exposure to fossil fuels. BHP’s Mt Arthur open cut mine, in the Hunter Valley region of New South Wales, supplies thermal coal used as fuel for power plants, to domestic and international customers. Prices have tumbled this year, slashing BHP’s likely sale price to less than $1 billion, two banking sources said. BHP and U.S. investment bank JP Morgan declined to comment. Australian bank Macquarie did not immediately respond to a request for comment. BHP previously said that the thermal coal business is a very small part of their portfolio, contributing about 3% of turnover and said in February that if a good offer came along they would be willing to sell. Activist investor Elliott, which holds a 4.7% stake in the mining company, has pushed for the sale of BHP’s thermal coal assets, which include one third of the Cerrejon mine in Colombia. BHP has also been pressured by green groups and some shareholders to leave any industry associations with policies that fail to match the company’s support for the 2015 Paris climate accord. Rival mining companies have also taken steps to go thermal coal free, with Rio Tinto selling its last coal mines in 2018, and Anglo American considering the spinoff or sale of its South African coal operations within the next two or three years. There is a handful of companies including Australia’s Whitehaven Coal Ltd, China’s Yancoal and India’s Adani Enterprises that have expressed interest in the Mt Arthur mine, the sources said. Sales processes have slowed over the past few months, as government lockdowns to contain the novel coronavirus halted mine visits and due diligence. But as lockdown measures are gradually lifted, banking sources expect a sale for Mt Arthur could be possible by the end of the year."
10.922674363485061," BHP announces stricter health protocols in Chile as cases among workers top 200 SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Global miner BHP Group Ltd announced stricter health protocols on Tuesday after cases of the novel coronavirus at its Escondida copper mine in Chile, the world´s largest, reached 150, with 59 at its smaller Spence deposit. BHP BHP.AX said 76 of those cases remained active and that the discovery of new cases suggested a ""stabilization and tendency toward decline."" It added: “This is a dynamic situation that can change rapidly, which is why we are making our best effort to implement all measures necessary to protect the health of our workers and contractors.” A spike in cases in the city of Calama had led BHP to route all workers flying into the mines via nearby Antofagasta airport instead, the company said, and workers were being encouraged to observe stricter social-distancing measures during trips. BHP is one of a number of major miners operating in Chile to have upgraded safety measures in recent weeks as the world’s No. 1 copper producer reaches the peak of coronavirus cases and deaths, and hospitals fill up. Last week, state-owned copper miner Codelco [CODEL.UL], the world`s biggest, announced a strengthening of safety measures including a 14-day-on, 14-day-off shift schedule and the suspension of some construction projects after two workers died from COVID-19. Labor unions rejected the measures as insufficient. Chile in May declared its copper industry among the least affected by the pandemic globally, with a drop of just 1% in output. But the recent changes have sparked speculation among analysts about a potential decline in output. The government had announced lockdowns for the mines-heavy Antofagasta Region to begin on Tuesday. Chilean Mining Minister Baldo Prokurica on Tuesday underlined the need to strike a balance between protecting mine workers from the coronavirus and keeping the country’s economic engine running. Prokurica said the “indispensable” mining sector had frozen the operations of about half its workforce through measures such as remote working, shift changes and suspension of projects, and tightened health protocols in response to the outbreak of the virus in Chile in March. But the mining industry needs to keep operating, he said, if the government is to sustain emergency social support packages to address economic fallout from the pandemic."
14.009226877962933," BHP names Lamont as new CFO; Beaven to step down MELBOURNE (Reuters) - BHP Group said on Wednesday that David Lamont, a former mining executive who has more recently been at global biotech firm CSL, would take the reins as company’s chief financial officer from the start of December. Lamont, who worked closely with BHP Chief Executive Mike Henry in BHP’s coal division in the early 2000s, has been CFO at Australia’s second-biggest listed company since January 2016. He will also join BHP’s executive leadership team, Henry said in a statement. Prior to joining CSL, Lamont was the CFO and an executive director at MMG Ltd, the Australia-listed arm of China’s MinMetals, from 2010, over the period it bought for $5.85 billion the giant Las Bambas copper mine in Peru from Glencore-Xstrata. During his time at MMG, Lamont managed the relationship with China’s Minmetals “very well” and better than his successors, said a mining industry source. “He’s a good operator; very disciplined, very focused,” the source said. Lamont previously served as CFO for several other multinational public companies across a range of industries, including Australian mid-tier copper miner OZ Minerals, and chemicals maker Incitec Pivot Ltd [IPLXXI.UL]. He also held senior roles at BHP between 2001 and 2006, including being CFO of the company’s carbon steel materials, thermal coal businesses, overlapping with Henry’s time in coal where they knew each other well. Lamont began his career as an accountant at Deloitte. Current BHP CFO Peter Beaven will step down on Nov. 30, but will remain in a support role until early 2021 after which he will leave the firm to pursue personal ambitions, BHP said. Beaven, a South African who joined BHP in 2003, lost the contest for BHP’s top job to Mike Henry last year and was expected to leave the firm. He had spent a decade in operational roles in South Africa and Chile, before becoming CFO in October 2014."
13.557243046347558," Australian state says BHP can disturb 40 sacred sites in mine expansion MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Western Australia approved BHP Group’s application to disturb 40 culturally significant Aboriginal sites as part of a mine expansion, the state government said on Thursday, days after Rio Tinto blew up sacred rock caves in the same area. State Aboriginal Affairs Minister Ben Wyatt said in a statement he had approved BHP's application to ""impact"" the sites in the iron ore-rich Pilbara region, where BHP BHP.AXBHPB.L is planning its $3.4 billion South Flank expansion. Under a legal loophole, traditional owners are not able to object to ministerial decisions made under Section 18 of the state’s Aboriginal Heritage Act when “land users conclude that impact to a site is unavoidable”. The loophole allows mining companies to apply for an exemption to damage or destroy cultural sites. “No objections were filed and I approved the notice on 29 May, 2020. This notice covers 40 Aboriginal sites,” Wyatt said in his statement. BHP sent a statement to Reuters saying it would not disturb any sites without further study and consultation with the Banjima people to understand the cultural significance of the region where it has been active for more than half a century. Chairman of Banjima Native Title Aboriginal Corporation, Maitland Parker, said: “As a matter of lore and culture shared with other traditional owners across Australia and the world, the Banjima people do not support the destruction of sites of cultural significance.” The approval came the same week Rio Tinto RIO.AXRIO.L blew up two caves in the Juukan Gorge, one of which showed evidence of continual human habitation stretching over 46,000 years. Wyatt said the area covered by BHP’s application was subject to a 2015 land use agreement in which the Banjima people committed to support the South Flank project. That agreement included 72 exclusion zones containing sites regarded as significant by the Banjima People, he said. Western Australia’s heritage laws, written in 1972, have been under review for the past two years."

The novel coronavirus has hit commodity prices and threatens to push global economy into a deep recession. In response, major mining companies have cut costs and delayed projects but the industry boasts strong balance sheets owing to years of slashing debt and investing cautiously. Speaking at a virtual presentation at Bank of America, BHP CEO Mike Henry said the capital allocation framework, which was introduced in 2016 and assesses the best way to deploy spending across the group, had “been a game-changer” for the company. “It’s helped us to drive high quality returns and growth, so it’s not going anywhere,” he said. BHP, the world’s largest listed miner, said in April that spending in the 2021 financial year would be lower than its original guidance of $8 billion due to the coronavirus outbreak. Henry also said BHP could act on the right M&A opportunity but focus is on organic growth. He said the company is on track to cut spending on overheads by more than $500 million by 2021, relative to last financial year. At the same conference, the chief executive of rival Rio Tinto, Jean-Sébastien Jacques said he saw more potential acquisition opportunities in the current environment. “We do also see the potential for new opportunities to emerge,” Jacques said in a speech at the conference, but cautioned that the pandemic would harm GDP growth and trade, which are key drivers for mining. “We are keeping a watching brief on M&A. Right now, the market is finding it difficult to value companies and the COVID-19 recovery pathway is not clear,” he said. Prices for iron ore, which is mined by both Rio and BHP, have been relatively resilient and helped boost profits in both firms due to robust demand from top consumer China. [IRONORE/]"

34.00100524119163," BHP looks to expand iron ore exports from Port Hedland MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Miner BHP Group said on Tuesday it plans to expand its iron ore export capacity from Port Hedland, the largest global shipping hub for the steel-making commodity, by up to 40 million tonnes a year to 330 million tonnes a year. The move comes as improvements across BHP’s supply chain have opened the way to raise shipments if market conditions allow, Tim Day, BHP’s Acting Asset President Western Australia Iron Ore, said in a statement. The company has begun community consultation, which could take four to six weeks, and would then apply to regulators for the added capacity in a process that is likely to take the rest of the year. Its focus in the medium term, however, remains on reaching its current capacity at the port of 290 million tonnes a year, Day said. BHP’s iron ore exports last financial year totalled 238 million tonnes, around 85 percent of capacity. Forecast shipments this year stand at 273 - 286 million tonnes. “Any increase in our production has the potential to deliver flow-on benefits for local jobs, local business and additional royalty revenues for the state,” Day said. BHP also said it planned to invest up to A$300 million ($194 million) more over five years to improve air quality and cut dust emissions across its Pilbara operations on top of A$400 million already spent. Dust emissions have been a major issue for global miners using the remote northern port, including Fortescue Metals and Gina Rinehart’s Hancock Prospecting, where dust particles have sparked health concerns. New measures will include “wind fences” to reduce dust lift-off from stockpiles, planting more vegetation and setting up more dust control projects across the supply chain.

44.77327414690379," BHP sees delay in expansion of Spence mine in Chile due to pandemic SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Global mining giant BHP said on Monday it expects a delay in the expansion of its Spence copper mine in Chile due to personnel cuts made to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The Spence deposit near the Chilean coastal city of Antofagasta is BHP’s second largest in Chile, after its sprawling Escondida copper mine, the world’s largest. The Spence mine is undergoing a nearly $2.5 billion expansion aimed at extending its productive life for more than 50 years. “The schedule is under review with the first production possibly delayed until the beginning of calendar year 2021, due to the decision to reduce occupation in the camp to facilitate social distancing protocols,” the company said in a statement. “As a result of the downsizing of the workforce, the commissioning of the desalination plant could potentially be delayed by a few months,” the statement added."
44.77327414690379," BHP holds iron ore output outlook despite virus risks MELBOURNE (Reuters) - BHP Group on Tuesday reported a 6.3% rise in third-quarter iron ore production that slightly missed analyst estimates, and maintained its iron ore forecast despite global economic disruption caused by the coronavirus outbreak. The world’s largest listed miner warned, however, that global steel production excluding China could drop sharply this year in light of the pandemic, and that capital spending in 2021 would be lower than its current outlook of $8 billion. The company kept its annual outlook for iron ore production unchanged at 273-286 million tonnes but said petroleum output would likely hit the bottom end of previous guidance of 110-116 million barrels of oil equivalent. It also revised to the lower end of range its outlook for metallurgical coal after heavy rains in Australia’s Queensland state, and put energy coal and copper production forecasts under review given temporary shutdowns of its Cerrejon coal mine in Columbia and its Antamina copper mine in Peru. BHP shares fell 1.6 percent in an Australian market down 0.7 percent at 0035 GMT. “It’s not too bad considering the events and what’s going on at the moment,” said analyst Glyn Lawcock of UBS in Sydney. “Their downgrades are not severe but we wait and see what the next 12 months holds. A lot of guidance hinges on mobility restrictions starting to lift from May. If they don’t because of a recurrence of COVID-19, then that is a risk,” he said. The coronavirus crisis has upended economic activity globally, but BHP has so far maintained that most of its operations remain unaffected by the pandemic despite a “small number” of its 72,000 employees testing positive for COVID-19. “While demand in China has strengthened in recent weeks, we expect other major economies, including the U.S., Europe and India, to contract sharply in the June 2020 quarter,” Chief Executive Officer Mike Henry said. Peer Rio Tinto Ltd, last week reported higher-than-expected first-quarter iron ore production, but cut its forecast for annual copper output, while Brazilian miner Vale SA cut its iron ore forecast on Friday due to coronavirus restrictions. Reported cases of the coronavirus have crossed 2.41 million globally and 165,854 people have died, according to a Reuters tally. BHP estimated steel output, excluding China, could contract by a double digit percentage in 2020 as virus-induced restrictions lead to curtailments in major producer countries. BHP produced a record 68 million tonnes of iron ore in the quarter ended March 31, up from 64 million tonnes in the cyclone-disrupted period a year earlier. However, it missed a UBS forecast of 69.2 million tonnes. It also flagged a deferral of several smaller petroleum projects, as well as a delay of $200 million in exploration and development spending for the sector which it said was equivalent to 30% of its usual budget."

37.291958646833514," Australia's top court rejects BHP appeal over tax ruling CANBERRA (Reuters) - Australia’s highest court on Wednesday dismissed an appeal by BHP Group against a tax ruling, the latest loss for the global miner over the treatment of profits from commodities sold out of its Singapore marketing hub. BHP said in a statement the decision offered clarity on the interpretation of a technical area of Australian tax rules, and it would pay $87 million in additional taxes for income generated over 2006-2018. The dispute was over whether BHP should pay so-called “top up tax” in Australia on profits made by its Singapore marketing hub from selling coal from an Australian mine owned by the UK side of BHP’s dual-listed structure, BHP Group Plc. The High Court of Australia upheld a federal court ruling that commodities acquired from Australian subsidiaries of BHP Group Plc are subject to “top up tax” in Australia under “controlled foreign company” rules. BHP had argued that its marketing hub in low-tax Singapore creates value, such as by negotiating specialised coal blends, for which extra profits should not be subject to additional tax. The tax office held that profits on commodities dug out of the ground in Australia should be subject to the country’s tax and royalty systems, no matter where they are sold from. The Australian Tax Office said in a statement the court decision finalised the dispute over marketing hub profits, which would be “fully taxed in Australia”. BHP said the additional tax represented less than 0.2% of the about A$71 billion ($46 billion) it had paid in taxes and royalties over the past 10 years. In 2018, BHP settled a separate transfer pricing dispute with the tax office for about A$529 million ($386 million), ending a battle over whether the company had been underpaying tax by basing its marketing arm in Singapore. It also agreed last June to pay the state of Western Australia A$250 million to end a dispute over royalties paid on iron ore shipments, also sold through its Singapore marketing hub.

38.930084134889704," BHP in 'good shape' to act if coronavirus disruption brings M&A openings -chmn MELBOURNE, March 10 (Reuters) - BHP Group is in good shape to take action should supply chain disruption caused by the global coronavirus epidemic trigger acquisition opportunities, the global miner’s Chairman Ken MacKenzie said on Tuesday. “On balance, the business is in very good shape,” MacKenzie said, speaking at the Australian Financial Review summit in Sydney. “I’m not sure if there will be any opportunities that will come from this but if there are, we are actually in a position to act.” Last month, the world’s biggest miner said this year’s demand could take a hit if fallout from the coronavirus outbreak extended beyond March. The virus, which originated in China, has now spread to at least 105 countries and territories and global economic growth is now expected to take a serious hit. Even as China’s businesses and economy show signs of recovery after a stringent campaign to contain the virus, production and transport disruption within the country have boosted import demand for BHP’s products such as iron ore and metallurgical coal, MacKenzie said. Global miners have been paying down debt and returning cash to shareholders since commodity prices revived following a crash in 2015, but investors remain cautious about large buys following disastrous top-of-the cycle acquisitions at the turn of last decade. BHP has returned $33 billion to shareholders since the cycle troughed and has paid down net debt to $12.8 billion, around half of $25.9 billion this time four years ago. “We have engineered the business so that (at) the bottom of the cycle, the business is not only capable of surviving but of thriving,” MacKenzie said. BHP has been focused on scenario analysis around the potential impact of the virus on global supply chains, he said. Since more value is created from moves at the bottom of the economic cycle, or when assets are cheap, the miner is also looking at any opportunities that might arise from other disruptions, like climate change. “We need to have a business that is ready for the bottom of the cycle at all times,” he said.

1.7923790510599957," Australia's Woodside Petroleum and BHP Group adjust Scarborough project stakes (Reuters) - Australia’s Woodside Petroleum and global miner BHP Group have marginally adjusted their stakes in two Scarborough project titles, Woodside said on Wednesday. Woodside will hold a 73.5% stake in each of the titles, while BHP will hold the remaining 26.5%. Woodside earlier held a 75% stake in the W-1-R permit, while the W-62-R was held 50% each by BHP and Woodside. Woodside has been looking to line up gas sales and sell down part of its stake in Scarborough to help fund the project, but talks had been slowed by travel curbs and weak gas prices following a coronavirus epidemic. The two companies have also agreed to apply for production licenses for both titles. “The production license applications are another key step to unlocking the full value of the Scarborough resource through the expansion of our existing Pluto LNG facility,” Woodside Chief Executive Peter Coleman said in a statement.

-10.59143385085006," Iron ore prices boosts BHP half-year profit, flags coronavirus risk MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Robust iron ore prices drove BHP Group, to its best result in five years on Tuesday but the world’s biggest miner said this year’s demand could take a hit if the fallout from the coronavirus outbreak in China extended beyond March. BHP’s underlying profit from continuing operations rose to $5.19 billion for the six months ended Dec. 31 from $4.03 billion a year earlier, the strongest result since 2015, lifted by lofty iron ore prices after last year’s supply disruption in Brazil and solid Chinese demand. The results were below estimates for a profit of $5.28 billion, according to analysts polled by research firm Vuma Financial. An interim dividend of 65 cents, 10 cents higher than last year, undershot forecasts for a dividend of 71 cents. “As long as coronavirus is ... better contained within this quarter, on balance, we think that for the remainder of the half, the overall market demand and the economy will hold up,” new Chief Executive Mike Henry told an investor briefing. “If it extends beyond that, of course, then we’d be back in looking at what the implications are.” UBS said the dividend was below forecasts because the board took a conservative approach to the virus outbreak. For now, BHP has not yet seen a major impact on its business and customers have kept paying for orders, Henry said, adding that other supply disruptions had supported iron ore prices. “We are moving all of our product. Demand remains pretty resilient. Prices have held up in part because of some other supply side disruptions,” Henry said. Rio Tinto downgraded its forecast on Monday for iron ore shipments for the year after this month’s cyclone off the coast of Western Australia. BHP is the first among its peers to report earnings. Global miners are all expected to have cashed in on last year’s higher iron ore prices, with a further boost coming as China pumped more money into its economy to alleviate an economic slowdown. China’s iron ore imports were at their second-highest level ever in 2019, further boosting profits. BHP was positioning itself well in a world that was seeking to reduce carbon emissions, Henry said. BHP was seeking to raise its exposure to copper and nickel through exploration and early stage acquisition, he said, adding it was also working on a potash project which produces a vital ingredient for fertiliser. “We need more copper and we need more nickel,” Henry told reporters, referring to two metals that are likely to benefit from the shift to electric vehicles and other lower carbon initiatives. Henry said the company could sell its thermal coal assets if it found a buyer at the right price. BHP has also been using more renewable power and was working to reduce so-called “scope three” emissions - or the emissions of its customers. It is also reviewing industry associations it funds to ensure they comply with its climate change goals. BHP was restructuring its technology operations to cut costs and planned to double the number of permanent roles from about 30% to 40% its 72,000-strong workforce now, Henry said. Australian shares climbed 0.8% on Tuesday to end at $A38.78, as the mining sector rallied after China stepped up stimulus to cushion the impact of the coronavirus outbreak. Free cash flow for the miner came in at $3.7 billion, compared with $3.6 billion a year earlier."

-23.296281182526478," BHP's Escondida drops plans to draw water from Atacama salt flat, relieving pressure on aquifers SANTIAGO (Reuters) - BHP’s Escondida, the world’s largest copper mine, said on Tuesday it had dropped plans to continue drawing water from the Atacama salt flat, relieving pressure on the parched desert basin, home to top lithium miners SQM and Albemarle. BHP has long pumped water from Atacama’s aquifers to feed operations at its sprawling Escondida mine. But shortly after applying to renew those permits in 2017, authorities warned the aquifer was overdrawn, stalling the process. The global miner said in a statement Tuesday it would now substitute its pumping from Atacama with desalinated water from its coastal Chilean plants. BHP’s decision is a step toward reducing pumping pressure on the vast, lithium-rich salt flat. The basin sits amid the world’s driest desert, where annual rainfall is often measured in millimeters. Soaring demand for ultralight battery metal lithium has raised questions about whether Atacama can support future levels of production along with the needs of nearby copper mines, a booming tourism industry and indigenous communities. “BHP’s decision advances by 10 years its commitment to stop extracting high Andean water for Escondida,” the miner said in the statement. It had previously said it would shut off the taps in 2030. BHP said its decision had taken into account conversations with indigenous communities around the flat. Antofagasta’s Zaldivar mine is also seeking to renew permits to draw water from the flat. Antofagasta, which co-owns Zaldivar with Barrick Gold Corp, did not immediately respond to requests for comments on BHP’s decision."

-31.03779732821098," Australian bushfires hit coal output, hazardous conditions to return SYDNEY (Reuters) - Mining giant BHP Group BHP.AX said on Tuesday that poor air quality caused by smoke from Australia's bushfires is hurting coal production, as authorities said a reprieve from hazardous fire conditions would end within days. The warning from the world’s biggest miner showed how an unusually long bushfire season that has scorched an area one-third the size of Germany is damaging the world’s No. 14 economy. Australia’s tourism and insurance industries have already foreshadowed they face a A$1 billion ($687 million) hit each from the fires. Scores of fires were still burning on the east coast on Tuesday despite thunderstorms and rain in recent days. Officials in New South Wales issued a high fire danger rating on the state’s south coast, while temperatures were forecast to rise in inland parts of Victoria state and neighboring South Australia on Wednesday. Combined with strong winds, the hotter temperatures will potentially fan existing bushfires and spark new ones into life, leading officials to declare “extreme fire danger” in some areas. “Tomorrow is real for us, extremely real,” Victorian Emergency Management Commissioner Andrew Crisp told reporters in Melbourne. BHP said smoke and dust from bushfires had reduced air quality at its energy coal mines in New South Wales state, and if the deterioration continued “then operations could be constrained further in the second half of the year.” The company later added in an emailed statement that operations had been affected by machines operating more slowly due to reduced visibility, while some staff had taken leave to protect their property from the fires. The fierce bushfires in Australia’s east have killed 29 people and millions of animals, destroyed more than 2,500 homes and razed 11 million hectares (27 million acres) of wilderness since September. The crisis follows three years of drought that experts have linked to climate change. The disruption has extended to the capital, Canberra, and its two biggest cities, Sydney and Melbourne, all of which have been repeatedly blanketed in thick smoke that has earned them air quality ratings among the worst in the world. Here are today’s key events in the bushfire crisis: ** By Tuesday evening, 64 fires were burning across New South Wales, none above the lowest warning level. There were 25 emergency warnings in Victoria. ** The Bureau of Meteorology warned the East Gippsland region to expect strong winds after thunderstorms rolled through a day earlier. Earlier this month, people in East Gippsland were evacuated by Navy ships as bushfires destroyed whole towns. ** The NSW state government, meanwhile, said it was increasing a grant for primary producers affected by the fires to A$75,000, from A$15,000 previously. ** A survey by Deloitte of 2,000 executives published on Tuesday showed 89% of Australian business executives viewed climate change and environmental sustainability as the “societal issue of greatest focus,” compared to 54% world-wide. ** The Australian Open tennis tournament continued in Melbourne. The city’s air quality was rated as “good”, according to the Air Quality Index, having been “hazardous” less than a week earlier, when a player collapsed in the preliminary rounds. ** The tennis community has raised more than A$50 million for bushfire relief, according to Tennis Australia."

-28.205987294733042," BHP maintains full year iron ore, thermal coal forecasts despite bushfire impact (Reuters) - BHP Group, the world’s biggest miner, on Tuesday maintained its full year iron ore and thermal coal output forecasts, despite production of the latter being hit by the Australian bushfires. New South Wales thermal coal output fell 11% in the first half to 7 million tonnes, BHP said in its December quarter production report, but maintained its full year forecast of between 15-17 million tonnes. “We are monitoring the situation and if air quality continues to deteriorate then operations could be constrained further in the second half of the year,” the company said in a statement. The global miner joined a growing list of companies dealing with the impact of the devastating fires that have scorched an area roughly a third of the size of Germany since September. Elsewhere, BHP reported that Australian iron ore output was 68 million tonnes for the three months ended Dec. 30, nearly 2% lower than in the September quarter and slightly below a UBS estimate of 69.3 million tonnes. It was, however, 3% higher than a year ago and with car dumper maintenance work in October now finished, BHP maintained its full year iron ore forecast of 273 million tonnes to 286 million tonnes. “It was pretty much in line across the board … perhaps a little bit weaker on coal for the quarter,” UBS analyst Glyn Lawcock in Sydney said of the production report. Copper output rose 6% to 455 kilotons from the end of September as higher throughput offset disruptions to the world’s largest copper mine, Escondida, following social unrest in Chile. Planned maintenance at Kwinana refinery and Kalgoorlie smelter also weighed on BHP’s nickel output in the quarter."
-28.47653147527912," Brazil prosecutors threaten to revive $37 billion lawsuit over Samarco delays: source BELO HORIZONTE, Brazil (Reuters) - Brazil’s federal prosecutors’ office has threatened to revive a 155 billion reais ($37 billion) lawsuit against Vale SA and BHP Group, citing delays in helping survivors of a deadly dam burst at their Samarco joint venture, a source close to ongoing talks on the matter between the companies and prosecutors told Reuters. The prosecutors’ warning that the lawsuit could be revived came during a meeting they held with the companies in December and was aimed at pressuring them to honor their pledges to hire advisory groups to help those affected by the disaster, the source said. The November 2015 dam burst in Minas Gerais state left 19 dead and hundreds of homeless. Although last year’s similar dam burst in Brumadinho had a higher death toll, the environmental damage from Samarco was much worse, extending to the coast of the adjoining state of Espirito Santo. Samarco had committed to retaining advisory groups in November 2017 as part of a partial settlement signed with authorities that allowed the suspension of the lawsuit. Vale and BHP have so far hired advisers for five of the disaster-hit towns, BHP said in a statement to Reuters. Federal prosecutors had set a November 2019 deadline for advisers to be hired for all of the 41 towns impacted, the source said. The prosecutors’ office has not ruled out other legal measures, added the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The activities to be carried out by the promised technical advisers include both monitoring the implementation of victims’ relief programs and providing technical and legal support to those affected. Vale, BHP and Samarco reiterated in responses to Reuters that they are committed to helping the communities and areas impacted by the dam burst and are in constant contact with prosecutors. They said they were in the process of hiring technical consultants for all the affected towns but declined to say when that would happen. “Vale is not opposed to hiring technical advice for those affected,” said the Brazilian mining company in a statement, acknowledging the advisers’ importance in compensating for the damage caused by the accident. Following the settlement agreement, the survivors themselves defined a list of 18 companies that could perform the services. Under the terms of the settlement, Samarco is required to hire all of them. According to Vale, 16 of those listed submitted proposals in October but they remain under review “due to the complexity of the proposed scope and the corresponding costs.” BHP said the proposals added up to a cost of 630 million reais and that it was also evaluating them. The Anglo-Australian miner also said the hardest hit communities are receiving support from advisers. Samarco said that so far about 7.42 billion reais has been allocated to reparation and compensation measures that are being conducted by the Renova Foundation, an independent institution created to conduct the work."

Cochilco said output at Codelco, the world’s top copper miner, plummeted 11% in November over the same month in 2018, to 155,200 tonnes. Production at BHP’s Escondida, the globe’s largest copper mine, fell 1.5% to 103,200 tonnes. The Collahuasi copper mine in northern Chile, a joint-venture between Anglo American and Glencore , produced 56,700 tonnes in November, up 9.7%, the agency said.

-41.80752182216518," BHP plans 'baby steps' return to commodities trading to cut transaction risk: sources MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Global miner BHP Group is feeling its way back into commodities trading, making a dedicated hire to help it manage a base metals book in Singapore as it seeks to boost returns and manage transaction risk, two people with knowledge of the matter said. The return to trading at the world’s biggest listed miner for the first time since the mid-2000s will see it add trading capacity across copper, energy and iron ore divisions in what one of the people described as “baby steps”. The move comes several years after peer Anglo American moved into trading of concentrates including third party material, which industry sources say has met with some success. BHP has hired Yuna Chang, formerly with mid-sized base metals trading house Concord Resources, to execute London Metal Exchange business, according to another person with direct knowledge of the matter. Chang did not respond to a request for comment made via LinkedIn. BHP will not be launching a proprietary trading desk, said the sources, who declined to be identified because discussions on the matter were private. It wasn’t immediately clear if BHP would extend credit to customers as part of the new trading arrangements. A BHP spokesman said the miner remained focused on creating value with its customers and that it would “constantly assess the commercial options that support their requirements and helps us achieve our objectives”. It said it would continue to leverage its physical copper book which is set to grow as it brings its Spence expansion in Chile online. BHP’s previous commodities trading stretches back to when it merged with British peer Billiton in 2001, setting up a centralized marketing model across its operations in Singapore and The Hague. The concept was to achieve consistent price realization, said a person involved at the time, as it leveraged its physical production to launch proprietary trading within predetermined risk limits, around pricing, as well as concentrates and refined metal. According to the person, who declined to be named because the matter was sensitive, Marius Kloppers, who had set up the scheme, abruptly dismantled it some five years later, before he became BHP’s chief executive in 2007, as he focused on cutting operational risk, after a credit-related loss in freight and losses in thermal coal. Australia’s big miners are well known for not hedging their price risk, preferring that shareholder returns reflect the peaks and troughs of the commodities cycle."
-34.83718379615406," Miner BHP Group's chief transformation officer to depart MELBOURNE (Reuters) - BHP Group said on Friday that its Chief Transformation Officer Jonathan Price would be leaving next year, as the miner shifts responsibility for the strategy away from the executive leadership team. Price’s departure is the second leadership exit announced in a week, after BHP said on Monday Chief Technology Officer Diane Jurgens would depart the company early next year. The shake-up comes as incoming Chief Executive Mike Henry prepares to take the reins of the world’s biggest miner when Andrew Mackenzie officially steps down at the end of the year. Over the past 18 months, BHP’s transformation strategy has allowed it to improve safety and reliability, lower costs, and boost returns, the company said in a statement on Friday. BHP had highlighted the strategy as recently as October, when Price gave a speech at a Melbourne mining conference about the ways the company was “transforming the core” of its business. A successful execution of that strategy was expected by investors and analysts to position Price as a strong contender for the top job after Henry. “Transformation” is now the responsibility of individual asset and function leaders, the company said. Price will oversee the transition of the transformation programs over the first half of 2020, after which he will move back to the United Kingdom with his family, BHP said."
-9.947648593565848," Church of England ups ante against anti-climate lobby LONDON (Reuters) - Ethical investors, including the Church of England, plan to extend their campaign for miners and other big businesses to stop funding industry associations that block progress on U.N. goals to curb climate change, they said on Tuesday. Shareholders of BHP, the world’s biggest listed miner, voted at meetings in October and November against a resolution to suspend the global miner’s membership in some industry groups, saying it was effectively paying the pro-coal lobby. Adam Matthews, director of ethics and engagement at the Church of England, told the Mines and Money conference in London on Tuesday he and other investors, representing large pension funds, would extend their campaign. “We’re really concerned incumbency is preventing the speed up towards a supportive regulatory environment,” Matthews said. He said investors planned to draw up more resolutions and would focus on the chemical and transport industries, as well as the natural resources sector, in cases where companies that accept U.N. goals on climate change are “misaligned” with industry bodies to which they subscribe. Fiona Reynolds, CEO of the Principles for Responsible Investment, which is campaigning alongside the Church of England, said in an emailed statement that negative corporate lobbying was a major reason for the slow progress towards action to limit temperature rises. “It’s completely unreasonable that companies use shareholder money to fund groups that do not act in investors’ long term interests,” she said. The ethical investors approve of some industry groups and are working with the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM), which includes the world’s biggest miners, to deliver a global standard on dams that store mining waste, known as tailings. The ICMM has admitted mining has work to do to earn the trust of investors and says its members will begin implementing revised sustainability principles, which include measures to protect the climate and environment, next year."

BHP, the world’s biggest miner, said it would raise its stake in the Brisbane-based miner to 14.7% from 11.1% by purchasing 77 million new shares in SolGold for 22.15 pence each, a 13.1% premium to SolGold’s last close of 19.58 pence. SolGold said this would make BHP the largest shareholder by a small margin. Australian gold miner Newcrest Mining Ltd NCM.AX was, until now, SolGold's largest shareholder, Refinitiv data showed. Shares of the SolGold jumped 15.9% to 22.70 pence after Bloomberg earlier reported that BHP was going to increase its stake in the London and Toronto-listed copper miner. BHP will also have options to buy more than 19.25 million SolGold shares, exercisable until Nov. 25, 2024 at a price of 37 pence per share, the global miner said. “SolGold’s view is that the agreement endorses its view of SolGold’s commanding Ecuadorean copper and gold exploration footprint, and in particular the robust Alpala deposit,” SolGold Chief Executive Nicholas Mather said in a statement."

A Canadian with 30 years experience in mining, including 16 at BHP and the past three at the helm of BHP’s Australian business, Henry was named on Thursday as the sucessor to Andrew MacKenzie. While less well known to the investment community than some of BHP’s other senior executives, Henry, 53, has a reputation as a thoughtful, ethical, diligent leader, more a safe pair of hands than an aggressive company builder. “He’s smart and dedicated and will apply himself with great diligence to the role. Mike leads by example,” said a former colleague who worked with Henry for several years. “He’s a really straight up and down guy. He doesn’t play games and for a guy in that position, he has his ego totally in check,” said the source, who asked not to be named. As head of BHP’s Australian operations, Henry has been responsible for the global miner’s vast iron ore, coal, copper and nickel assets in the country, leading nearly 40,000 people. “He seems like a pretty good appointment. Obviously he has a number of years of experience within BHP running a very large part of the organisation from a profitability point of view.. So the level of experience is definitely there,” said Ausbil Chief Investment Officer Paul Xiradis. BHP highlighted Henry’s role in developing a BHP-wide operating system that has delivered big cost savings, as well championing diversity - doubling the number of female employees and boosting indigenous employment. At a news conference on Thursday, Henry stressed the importance of safety, a key issue for BHP after it took a reputational hit from a Brazilian dam collapse in 2015, and said he would look to unlock more value from the company’s assets. “We do live in an uncertain world,” he said. “That’s why...(we) need to be driving performance within the core business because that discipline, that performance will be what will allow us to navigate an uncertain world in the right way that will continue to grow value.” Henry, who has experience in Europe, North America and Asia and lives with his wife in Melbourne, will still need to win over some Australian fund managers, who would have preferred an outside appointment. Some investors also cited a less than smooth performance of BHP’s Australian operations after a runaway iron ore train last year had to be forcibly derailed, and underpeformance at the Olympic Dam copper mine in South Australia.

3.5871658343024477," Global miner BHP taps Australia head Henry as new CEO MELBOURNE (Reuters) - BHP Group Ltd BHP.AXBHPB.L on Thursday named its Australian head Mike Henry to succeed Andrew Mackenzie as the miner's chief executive, shunning calls from some investors for fresh blood from outside the Anglo Australian giant. Mackenzie, 62, will step down on Dec. 31 ending nearly seven years in charge of the biggest global miner, during which time he overhauled the company, spinning off a raft of assets and cutting costs sharply. Henry, a 53-year-old Canadian who joined BHP in 2003, has led its Australian operations over the past three years, including its biggest earner, iron ore, and the world’s largest metallurgical coal operations. He takes the helm just as slowing growth in China, the company’s biggest customer, as well as environmental and social issues, raise new risks and threaten to dent profits across the industry. In his first year, he will have to lead the group’s decision on whether to go ahead with a long-planned $17 billion push into potash mining in Canada. Analysts and investors who welcomed his appointment said he was a sensible choice among the candidates who were touted. “This internal promotion is a positive development for BHP as we view Mike Henry as a pragmatic, operations focused manager with a unique set of international and BHP-specific experiences,” said RBC analyst Paul Hissey. BHP’s shares initially fell 1.6% after the announcement in a flat broader market, reflecting some investors’ disappointment, but then recovered to trade down 0.4%. “The board had the chance to reinvigorate, re-energise. Now we get more same, same,” said Shaw & Partners analyst Peter O’Connor. (GRAPHIC: BHP new boss: BHP lags Rio during Mackenzie's tenure - ) “PERFECT MIX” The appointment of a new CEO was not a surprise, but the timing was a bit sooner than some had expected, as Mackenzie has repeatedly said over the past year that he is keen to stay on. BHP Chairman Ken MacKenzie said Henry’s integrity, exacting standards and deep operational and commercial experience in a career spanning the Americas, Europe, Asia and Australia made a “perfect mix” for a BHP CEO. “I’m confident that his discipline and focus will deliver high performance and returns,” MacKenzie told reporters. Henry said his top priorities were safety, maintaining social license, trimming the group’s environmental footprint, digital transformation and staff diversity. “I have the luxury of being able to lead a company that is in really good shape. We have a great strategy. I see that my job as the next CEO is to build on the foundations to accelerate that performance,” he told reporters. Investors and analysts, however, said the Australian minerals business under Henry had experienced some difficulties, including long-running problems at its Olympic Dam copper and uranium mine and a runaway iron ore train that had to be derailed to avoid a disaster. “For us Olympic Dam is an important test, because it’s a challenging asset and it needed to be managed closely and carefully ... and that hasn’t happened,” said a fund manager who declined to be named because the issue was sensitive. Some Australian institutional investors had been pushing BHP to consider external candidates to replace Mackenzie as CEO. Names mentioned included Anglo American Plc AAL.L CEO Mark Cutifani and former Fortescue Metals Group CEO Nev Power. Under Mackenzie, BHP spun off a raft of assets into South32 S32.AX and quit its ill-fated U.S. shale business to focus on iron ore, coal, copper and conventional oil and gas. At the same time, it faced down investor pressure to collapse its dual-listed structure, spin off its entire petroleum business, and slash carbon emissions to tackle climate change. But Mackenzie’s legacy has been tarred by the reputational damage from a dam disaster at an iron ore mine in Brazil. BHP said Henry will earn a base salary of $1.7 million a year."

2.2831030435142763," Miner BHP taps oil, gas for growth after shale exit (Reuters) - BHP Group BHPB.LBHP.AX touted bullish plans on Monday to expand in oil and gas after quitting a disastrous foray into U.S. shale, defying investors who want the world's biggest miner to cast off the business. The company’s petroleum head said the business is set to deliver strong returns and cash flow through the 2020s and beyond, supported by high-potential projects in the Gulf of Mexico, Western Australia and Trinidad & Tobago. Petroleum, which accounted for about 16% of BHP’s underlying earnings in 2018/19, could potentially generate margins of more than 60% over the next decade, Geraldine Slattery, President Operations Petroleum, told a briefing. Excluding the shale business, the company’s oil and gas arm has long had some of the strongest returns in the group’s portfolio, including iron ore, copper and coal. With projects awaiting approval, the division could support average annual volume growth of up to 3% in the decade to 2030, and deliver average internal rates of return for major projects of around 25%, she said at the company’s first petroleum briefing since 2016. “In a decarbonising world, deepwater oil and advantaged gas close to established infrastructure can offer competitive returns for decades to come,” Slattery said. BHP said it made sense to expand in oil, even in a world with rapid uptake of electric vehicles, with demand for petroleum set to grow for trucks, petrochemicals and fertilisers well into the second half of this century. It singled out potential growth from the Scarborough gas project operated by Woodside Petroleum WPL.AX, the Wildling Phase I and Trion projects in the Gulf of Mexico, and its Trinidad & Tobago North assets - all still unsanctioned. “Scarborough offers material growth potential to our Australian portfolio,” Slattery told analysts at a briefing. She said BHP sees the highest returns from adding resources through exploration, but did not rule out making acquisitions. Last year, BHP ended a massive loss-making seven-year foray into shale by selling most of its U.S. onshore shale oil and gas assets to BP Plc BP.L for $10.5 billion. (reut.rs/34MGsox) RBC Capital said in a note on Monday that while the petroleum division had suffered from the misadventure, three offshore projects under construction should substantially boost production over the next three years. A return to growth for the petroleum division, where output is slated to fall this year, would also differentiate BHP from the wider, iron ore-heavy diversified mining sector, RBC said.

-0.7771664085194278," BHP says it is unaffected by sanctions on China's COSCO LONDON (Reuters) - The sanctions imposed by the United States on subsidiaries of Chinese state-owned group COSCO have not affected the world’s biggest dry bulk shipper BHP, the mining company said, after carrying out due diligence to check. In one of the biggest sanctions actions taken by the U.S. government since its crackdown on Iranian oil exports, Washington imposed sanctions on Chinese companies in late September for alleged involvement in moving crude oil from Iran. COSCO Shipping Tanker (Dalian), a subsidiary of China’s state-owned shipping group COSCO, was one of the companies blacklisted. Washington made it clear the COSCO group was not affected, but there have been concerns among charterers of ships that they could still be exposed. COSCO operates in multiple segments of the seaborne trade, including container and dry bulk shipping. Rashpal Bhatti, vice president of maritime and supply chain excellence, at BHP said COSCO was one of its “strategic partners”, but a due diligence check had shown none of the vessels it uses for dry bulk shipping of coking coal and iron ore were affected. “The sanctions were ring-fenced to a different part of Cosco’s business, nothing to do with bulk shipping,” Bhatti told Reuters."

Votes tallied after BHP’s annual general meeting (AGM) in Sydney showed 72.93% rejected the resolution, BHP said in a filing. At the London AGM, only 22.16% of votes supported the motion. The Sydney gathering represented about 58% of all BHP shareholders, with the remaining 42% in London. Ethical investors had called for the suspension, arguing BHP’s membership in some industry organisations funds pro-coal lobbying. One of BHP’s biggest shareholders, Aberdeen Standard Investments, part of Standard Life Aberdeen, last month spoke out in favour of the resolution. The vote occurred as an influential lobby group for Australia’s multi-billion dollar coal mining industry in September launched an advertising blitz to rally public support for an overhaul of state planning laws after a commission blocked new projects, citing climate change concerns. “Climate change is a complex problem,” Chairman Ken MacKenzie said at the Sydney AGM. “If we are to successfully develop solutions we need to collaborate. We need to work together. And industry associations provide a vital forum for that collaboration.” MacKenzie repeated BHP’s view that it is easier to influence from within, and said that industry groups provide many essential avenues, including around setting standards and other issues, that were not acknowledged in the resolution. Still, ethical investors claimed the result represented a degree of success, with 29.58% of proxy votes in favour of the resolution. A further 0.62% abstained. “This is a huge result on a very direct call for suspension, and represents an awakening for the Australian investment community,” said Brynn O’Brien, Executive Director at the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility. “Lobbying counter to the goals of the Paris Agreement has been tolerated for far too long ...

2.474959819998883," BHP weighing LNG power for iron ore ships LONDON (Reuters) - BHP, the biggest listed miner, aims to decide early next year who has won a tender for LNG-fueled transport to ship up to 27 million tonnes, or about 10%, of its iron ore to cut emissions by around a quarter, a senior executive said. Miners are under pressure to become less polluting as society worries about the environment and investors increasingly regard a compelling sustainability strategy as an indication that a company is well-run. BHP says it has a responsibility to address emissions, as the biggest producer of coking coal and a major shipper of iron ore. Both minerals generate huge amounts of carbon dioxide and other emissions as they are shipped around the world and then used to make steel. “Decarburization is an absolutely paramount debate,” Rashpal Bhatti, BHP’s vice president for maritime and supply chain excellence, told Reuters in an interview. “As the largest bulk shipper in the world, we feel a distinct sense of responsibility.” In July, BHP decided a tender was the best way to assess the available expertise on engineering, tanks and refueling in its quest to shift from conventional marine fuel. Bhatti said BHP was considering 17 detailed submissions, from established companies to start-ups, and hoped to award the tender in the first quarter of next year. Switching to liquefied natural gas (LNG) could cut carbon emissions by around 25%, as well as eliminating NOx (nitrogen oxide), SOx (sulfur oxide) and some of the particulate matter associated with conventional shipping fuel. Bhatti said he could not be specific on the budget, but believed an LNG-fueled vessel could be economic, with costs “on a par with or better than a conventional-fuel vessel”. The cost of a Capesize vessel, the largest dry cargo ship, was around $55 million to $75 million annually, he said. Some criticize the use of gas because it is not carbon-free, but BHP says it is realistic in the near term. LNG-fueled tankers could be carrying iron ore by late 2021, Bhatti said, and in time, the tanks under consideration might also be suitable for hydrogen, which is getting attention as a possible low-carbon fuel. New standards set by the United Nations’ International Maritime Organization (IMO), known as IMO 2020, take effect next year to cut sulfur emissions. The IMO has set a goal to halve climate-warming emissions from shipping by 2050 compared with 2008 levels. BHP stands apart from many miners by having a target to become net zero by 2050, in line with overall U.N. carbon-cutting goals."
4.498061551325532," Australia's Iluka Resources flags possible demerger of BHP royalties asset (Reuters) - Australia’s Iluka Resources Ltd, the world’s largest producer of zircon, said on Thursday it was considering a demerger of an asset that earns royalties from a BHP Group iron ore operation - Mining Area C (MAC). Iluka holds a royalty over iron ore produced from specific properties of MAC, resulting from a 1994 agreement. MAC is a large iron ore mining area in Pilbara, and is operated by BHP. The mineral sands producer said it expected much higher royalties from MAC following the completion of BHP’s development of its South Flank project. “Thanks to the South Flank development, it (MAC) has significant growth in expected cash flows. In addition, further growth in the value of MAC is possible given the potential for the development by BHP of deposits within the area covered by the royalty agreement,” Iluka Managing Director Tom O’Leary said. Iluka said the possible demerger is part of a broader review of its two “principal” businesses- its mineral sands operations and MAC. Shares of the company rose as much as 7% after the announcement."
6.436032658970614," Unionized workers at BHP's Escondida mine in Chile to walk-off Tuesday SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Unionized workers at BHP’s Escondida copper mine, the world’s largest, said late on Monday they would walk off the job for part of the work day on Tuesday in a show of solidarity with protests in Chile. Escondida’s Union No.1, the mine’s largest, said in a statement workers on each of the day and night shifts on Tuesday would walk off the job for half of their working hours. “Our workers ... have agreed in near unanimity to protest against a series of abuses and violations by the company, and to show solidarity for the demonstrations against economic and social policies that affect us as workers,” the union said in the statement. BHP did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Chile, the world’s top copper producer, has long been one of the region’s most prosperous and stable free-market economies. But entrenched inequality and spiraling costs of living ignited massive, and sometimes violent, protests last week. Riots, arson and looting have led to at least 17 deaths, resulted in more than 7,000 arrests and caused upwards of $1.4 billion in losses to Chilean businesses. Copper mining companies in Chile last week said nationwide riots had mostly spared production but continuing protests had hobbled port facilities, public transportation and supply chains, impacting operations."

Several Chilean cities were engulfed by days of riots, along with peaceful protests, after a hike in public transport costs. Arson, looting and riots over the weekend left at least seven dead. “This strike is a warning,” said Patricio Tapia, president of Escondida’s Union #1. He said workers would walk off for “at least one shift tomorrow.” Mining minister Baldo Prokurica told Reuters late on Sunday that the country’s mines operated normally through the weekend. Escondida is the world’s largest copper mine."
14.882181807041341," BHP switches to green power for Chilean copper starting 2021 LONDON (Reuters) - BHP, the world’s biggest miner, said on Monday it had signed four renewable energy contracts to supply all of its Chilean copper operations beginning in 2021, cutting energy costs by 20%. Miners, which often use fossil fuels as the energy source in their operations, are shifting to renewable generation as the cost of wind and solar power drops, while social and shareholder pressure to address climate change mounts. Daniel Malchuk, president of BHP Minerals Americas, said BHP had signed contracts to cover the energy needs of Escondida, the world’s biggest copper mine, and Spence, another copper mine in Chile, the world’s leading copper-producing country. These include 15-year contracts from August 2021 with Enel Generacion Chile for 3 terawatt hours per year (TWh/year) and 10-year contracts for 3 TWh with Chilean utility Colbun from January 2022. They will displace 3 million tonnes of carbon dioxide from 2022 compared with fossil fuel-based contracts, equivalent to annual emissions from 700,000 combustion-engine cars. BHP did not give a cost for the new contracts, but said they were the most extensive signed by a corporate customer in Chile. They will result in a provision of about $780 million related to the cancellation of the existing coal contracts, which will be recognized in BHP’s December 2019 half-year results. “It’s good for the environment, it’s good for emissions, but it’s also great business,” Malchuck told reporters in London. Chile has taken a lead in renewable power, and costs there for wind and solar energy have plunged. Another mining major, Anglo American, said in July it would use only renewable sources to power its mines in Chile beginning in 2021 following another deal signed with Enel’s Chilean subsidiary. BHP Chief Executive Andrew Mackenzie said he expected the trend to continue globally. “As part of global decarbonization, similar moves from coal more or less directly to renewables may be required over the coming decades in other countries, particularly those without access to cheap gas,” he said. BHP, Anglo American and other miners also say they are seeking to reduce water use, especially as many mining operations are in arid areas. In Chile, BHP said it was working to eliminate the depletion of aquifers in the desert regions where it operates. It has a goal not to source water from aquifers by 2030 and is instead investing in desalination plants."

18.830208270850775," BHP's London AGM rejects call to quit 'pro-coal' associations LONDON (Reuters) - BHP BHP.AXBHPB.L shareholders are poised to reject a motion urging the world's biggest listed miner to suspend membership of some industry bodies judged to be at odds with goals to tackle climate change, initial voting in London suggested on Thursday. Ethical investors have called for the suspension, arguing BHP’s membership of some industry organizations funds pro-coal lobbying. One of BHP's biggest shareholders, Aberdeen Standard Investments, part of Standard Life Aberdeen SLA.L, last week spoke out in favor of the resolution, saying lobby groups can be a major obstacle to positive change. But at the London annual general meeting, which represents 42% of shareholders, only 22.16% of votes supported the motion to suspend membership of trade associations that are not lobbying in line with the Paris Climate Agreement. The ballot will be followed by another vote on Nov. 7, representing the remaining 58%, in Australia, where there is strong support for coal as a provider of jobs and wealth. Adam Matthews, director of ethics and engagement for the Church of England Pensions Board, which supported the resolution, said it had the backing of investors with more than $10 trillion of assets under management. “It is essential that lobbying be used as a constructive force and not one designed to delay, divert and disrupt the long-term interests of the company and its shareholders,” Matthews said. BHP executives say they use membership of industry bodies to push for positive change. “Climate change is a complex problem. If we’re going to develop successful solutions, we need to collaborate,” Chairman Ken MacKenzie told reporters. But non-governmental organization the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR) urged BHP to reconsider its position ahead of the Australian vote. “History will not look kindly upon those who — in 2019 — choose to side with climate wreckers,” ACCR Executive Director Brynn O’Brien said in a statement. BHP has pledged to invest $400 million over five years to reduce emissions and to tackle the huge amount of pollution caused when customers use its products, notably coking coal and iron ore to make steel. It says steel and other minerals it produces are essential to the roll out of cleaner technology and justifies its continued investment in fossil fuel on the grounds transition has to be gradual. CEO Andrew Mackenzie said industry projections showed “continued use and growth in the use of oil and coal well into the 2030s”. “You can’t suddenly lurch from running a fossil fuel world to a world that’s fully based on renewables without causing incredible disruption both to the reliability of energy and its cost,” he said."
18.48122235821459," Australia's Woodside aims to hit go on $11 billion gas project in early 2020 MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Woodside Petroleum Ltd has pushed out the final approval date for its mammoth Browse gas project but slightly brought forward plans to sign off on its smaller Scarborough project as it races to fill an anticipated global supply gap. Woodside, Australia’s top independent gas producer, said on Thursday it is now targeting a final investment decision on the $20.5 billion Browse project in the first half of 2021 as it continues to wrangle with its partners. It had previously expected approval in late 2020. However, Woodside also said it now aims to sign off on the $11 billion Scarborough gas project and Pluto LNG expansion in early 2020, as opposed to the first half of 2020. “We feel very motivated and confident about the timetables that we’ve laid out,” Woodside Chief Financial Officer Sherry Duhe told Reuters in an interview. “Our competition is global,” Duhe added. “The entire global LNG community has obviously seen that there’s a supply gap that’s sitting out there once we get past 2021, 2022, and we believe that our projects are perfectly timed.” The faster timetable for the Scarborough project is dependent on Woodside reaching an agreement with its partner BHP Group on a price for processing gas from the field at the Pluto plant. Pressure is on BHP to finalize a tolling agreement before the end of the year, Duhe said, noting that BHP has an option that expires on Dec. 31 to increase its stake in Scarborough by 10% to 35%. “We’re just haggling on the final bit of pricing on the toll,” Duhe said. “Time is definitely working in all of our favor now to just go ahead and ink that deal so that we can move to FID (final investment decision) in early next year on both Scarborough and Pluto.” BHP had no immediate comment on its plans for Scarborough. It has previously said it sees the project as an attractive low risk opportunity but with lower returns compared to some of its other growth options. Discussions on Browse, the biggest undeveloped gas resource off northwestern Australia, are more complicated as they involve several partners in both the field and the associated West Shelf LNG plant, with only some overlap in ownership. Chevron Corp and BHP are stakeholders in the LNG plant but not Browse, and PetroChina is in Browse but not the LNG plant. The other stakeholders -- Woodside, Royal Dutch Shell, BP Plc and Japan’s Mitusbishi Corp and Mitsui & Co are on both sides of the fence. Woodside said it still expects the partners to be able to hit go on preliminary engineering for Browse, which has been stuck on the drawing board for years, by the end of this year. Duhe said Woodside also aims to sign off on its $3 billion Senegal oil project before the end of this year, ahead of a ruling on an arbitration with its partner FAR Ltd over Woodside’s stake in the project. “We don’t see that in any way interrupting our plans to move forward to FID and into construction,” Duhe said. Woodside on Thursday reported third-quarter revenue of $1.16 billion, unchanged from a year earlier, with higher production offset by weaker LNG prices."
18.48122235821459," BHP sets early 2021 for decision on Jansen potash project MELBOURNE (Reuters) - BHP Group Ltd, the world’s biggest miner, said on Thursday it will make a final investment decision on its long-delayed $17 billion Jansen potash project in Canada around February 2021. Investors have been awaiting a decision by BHP on whether to go ahead with project, which would be its most significant investment in years, and which it hopes will provide another pillar of long-term growth. In its September production report, BHP said project planning and work to finalize a port solution was continuing and the $5 billion-plus Stage 1 will be presented to the board for an investment decision by February 2021. BHP, which has already spent $2.7 billion on Jansen, said in May it expects excess supply capacity of the crop nutrient to be used up by the middle of the next decade, while the Jansen project would create a “high-margin, long-life” mine. Potash is a potassium-rich salt mainly used in fertilizer to improve the quality and yield of agricultural production. Elsewhere, BHP posted a slight dip in its September quarter iron ore production due to planned maintenance at a key port, but maintained its fiscal 2020 iron ore production forecast. The result was in line with analyst forecasts and came as the miner carries out ongoing maintenance at Port Hedland, the world’s biggest iron ore port, which is used by three of the country’s top four iron ore miners. “Lower volumes reflected significant planned maintenance at Port Hedland, including a major car dumper maintenance program,” BHP said in a statement. Output for the three months ended Sept. 30, BHP’s first fiscal quarter, was 69 million tonnes, down 1% on a year ago and 3% on the June quarter. Annual output is expected at 273 million to 286 million tonnes. Iron ore prices have come off five-year highs touched in July as Brazil’s Vale ramped up production that had been curtailed by a fatal dam disaster, and Australian shipments are expected to moderate into year-end. “Overall, a solid result for BHP with all key segments broadly in line with our estimates,” RBC said in a report. “BHP’s more diverse portfolio mitigates the potential impact of falling iron ore prices...We maintain our preference for BHP over its key Australian peer Rio.” Quarterly copper output rose 5% on a year ago as production recovered from outages in Australia and Chile, while metallurgical coal production fell after planned maintenance shutdowns."

9.63515839793778," Investors with more than $5 trillion target BHP over coal funding MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Investors representing A$8 trillion ($5.4 trillion) have backed a call for BHP BHPB.LBHP.AX to ditch funding for industry groups whose actions are inconsistent with the Paris climate agreement, an Australian NGO said on Thursday. The Australian Centre for Corporate Responsibility, a small shareholder in BHP, the world’s biggest listed miner, co-filed a resolution in September that recommended the company suspend its membership of such industry bodies. But BHP said its board would recommend shareholders vote against the resolution at its annual general meetings because it was already reviewing its industry memberships and the policy positions taken by those groups since January 2018. BHP will hold its London AGM on Thursday next week and in Sydney on Nov. 7. Non-government organization ACCR said in a statement that a base of 27 investors would back its resolution, including the Californian superannuation fund CalPERS, AXA Investment Managers, BNP Paribas Asset Management and Aviva Investors. This also includes the Church of England Pensions Board and top-five investor Aberdeen Asset Management, which said this week that they planned to support the resolution. It was unclear what percentage of BHP shares the 27 investors held in total. BHP is trying to establish itself as a leader in climate-change management after Chief Executive Andrew Mackenzie in July pledged to spend $400 million on curtailing emissions. It also says it believes engagement can promote best practice. It funds several industry bodies, including the New South Wales Minerals Council of Australia, which has launched an advertising blitz in support of coal jobs in the state. The NSW Minerals Council is rallying public support for an overhaul of state planning laws after the state’s Independent Planning Commission blocked several coal projects, citing concerns over climate change. The NSW council referred Reuters to its climate change policy, which says it supports a measured transition to a low-emissions economy including participation in global agreements such as the 2015 Paris accord. It also says “sustained global action is required to reduce the risks of human-induced climate change”. Australia, among the world’s largest per-capita carbon emitters, is also the world’s largest coal exporter. New South Wales, where BHP’s Mt Arthur thermal coal mine is located, is the second largest coal-producing state."
9.63515839793778," Breakingviews - BHP and shareholders share green lobbying dilemma HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - Is it better to criticise from inside the tent, to paraphrase U.S. President Lyndon Johnson’s famously earthy line, or from outside? Aberdeen Standard and other shareholders want miner BHP to cut ties with industry groups at odds with Paris climate pledges. The $113 billion Anglo-Australian giant says it is already reviewing its memberships, but argues change can be promoted from within too. It’s a quandary familiar to fossil fuel investors. At annual meetings over the coming weeks, shareholders will grill boss Andrew Mackenzie’s outfit over the company it keeps. That makes sense: the impact of negative lobbying is significant, and detrimental. It encourages companies to focus on the short-term - resisting carbon pricing, for example - rather than preparing for inevitable change. It also makes for uncomfortable contradictions if companies like BHP talk up green goals, while paying others to undermine them. Such duplicity can be symptomatic of other governance troubles, and there’s reputational risk too, so shareholders are right to be concerned. Break-ups are underway. Exxon Mobil and Royal Dutch Shell have already announced high-profile exits. BHP left the World Coal Association after its last membership review in 2017. But this hasn’t altered the balance of power much yet. The U.N.-backed Principles for Responsible Investment said last year that of the 50 most powerful trade groups, organisations opposing climate policy outnumbered those supporting it by seven to one. The question then becomes whether it is better to be inside pushing for change, or to cut ties altogether. Green-minded investors face a similar conundrum: can they exert more pressure by holding shares, or divesting? The answer depends on influence, and BHP is the biggest kid on the block. Take the Minerals Council of Australia. In 2016, BHP paid MCA A$1.9 million ($1.29 million), 17% of its subscription revenue. And yet MCA is only beginning to draw up a climate action plan. BHP pushes back against shareholder criticism by pointing to its periodic membership review; that’s insufficient. Excluding obviously problematic partners like Coal21 is not enough either. But Mackenzie has a plausible argument that he can make a difference from the inside. The miner can assuage investors by not only laying out organisations’ positions and points of disagreement, but also setting clear goals for them, as it does for itself. That would leave less room for hypocrisy."
14.09340765982184," Top-5 BHP investor Aberdeen Standard piles on climate pressure ahead of AGM LONDON (Reuters) - One of BHP’s biggest shareholders Aberdeen Standard Investments on Wednesday added to pressure for the world’s leading miner to cut ties with lobby groups it says are at odds with the company’s pledges on climate leadership. Earlier, the Church of England Pensions Board urged shareholder advisers to review their opposition to a resolution calling on BHP to withdraw from groups that lobby for policies inconsistent with global climate change limitation goals. Aberdeen Standard Investments, which holds around 3.2% of BHP’s stock, said it was taking the rare step of speaking out ahead of a vote at BHP’s annual shareholder meeting in London on Oct. 17 because of the urgency of tackling climate change, and after its research found the lobby groups were the biggest single obstacle to progress. In a telephone interview, Bill Hartnett, stewardship director at Aberdeen Standard, said BHP had shown climate leadership in many ways, but that stance was contradicted by its membership of some industry groups. “Failure to implement effective governance of its industry group lobbying activities serves to undermine the integrity of BHP’s climate leadership position and causes damage to its reputation,” Hartnett said. He did not specify which lobby groups. Aberdeen Standard Investments, part of Standard Life Aberdeen, is a top-five shareholder according to Refinitiv data. Shareholders are intensifying pressure on resource companies because of the urgency of preventing potentially catastrophic climate change. But in Australia, where many of dual-listed BHP’s shareholders are based, there is strong support for coal as a historic provider of jobs and wealth. Industry groups such as Minerals Council of Australia have repeatedly called for coal friendly policies. BHP, whose income derives primarily from iron ore and coking coal, used to make steel, says it is committed to cutting emissions and making mining sustainable. It also said it is reviewing its membership of industry groups and has withdrawn from some of them, but believes engagement can promote best practice. Also on Wednesday, the Church of England Pensions Board, which manages the retirement funds of clergy and other staff, said investors representing more than 2.1 trillion pounds ($2.57 trillion) of assets under management had indicated they would support a resolution on lobbying. The resolution, first made public in September, recommends “membership of industry associations be suspended where their advocacy demonstrates overall inconsistency with the Paris Agreement’s goals”. The international agreement in 2015 aims to restrict global warming and the resolution’s authors say lobbying for the use of coal is inconsistent with this. The pensions board said proxy voting advisory firms ISS and Glass Lewis, who guide institutional investors, had not recommended its clients support the resolution and called for a meeting with them and the investors to discuss the issue. “Any investor that determines the quality of a proxy advisor’s advice based solely on whether one is ‘for’ or ‘against’ a proposal, with no regard for the extensive analysis, reasoning, expertise and engagement that such advisors conduct on behalf of their clients, raises serious concerns about their ability to meet their own regulatory and fiduciary duties,” said Aaron Bertinetti, Glass Lewis’ senior vice president, research and engagement, in response. Climate change was “a very serious and material issue”, but not the only issue that needed to be considered, he added. ISS declined to comment. Last month, BHP said its board would recommend shareholders oppose the resolution at its annual general meetings in London next week and in Sydney on Nov. 7."
14.09340765982184," REFILE-Church of England calls for climate voting debate before miner BHP's AGM (corrects typo in paragraph 2) LONDON, Oct 9 (Reuters) - The Church of England Pensions Board urged shareholder advisors on Wednesday to support a resolution asking the world’s biggest listed miner BHP to leave groups which lobby for policies inconsistent with global climate change limitation goals. The board, which manages the retirement funds of clergy and other staff, has joined some other BHP shareholders in the resolution for BHP’s London AGM next week to increase pressure over the issue and wants more shareholders to support it. “Corporate funding of lobbying, fuelled with shareholder funds, is continuing at pace,” Adam Matthews, head of the board’s ethics and engagement, said. The resolution recommends “memberships of industry associations be suspended where their advocacy demonstrates overall inconsistency with the Paris Agreement’s goals”. The international agreement in 2015 aims to restrict global warming and the resolution’s authors say lobbying for the use of coal is inconsistent with this. BHP says it is committed to cutting emissions and promoting sustainable mining and backs the Paris Agreement. It said it is reviewing its membership of industry groups and has withdrawn from some of them but believes engagement with some of them helps to promote best practice. The pensions board said proxy voting advisory firms ISS and Glass Lewis, who act for institutional investors, had not recommended its clients support the resolution and called for a meeting with them and the investors to discuss the issue. “The decision by the proxy voting advisors ISS and Glass Lewis not to recommend support for the co-filed shareholder resolution raises serious questions about how investors can receive advice that enables them to meet their fiduciary duties to navigate the financial risks posed by climate change.” Asked to comment, Aaron Bertinetti, Glass Lewis’ senior vice president, research and engagement said investors focusing only on an adviser’s approach to a proposal rather than “the extensive analysis, reasoning, expertise and engagement such advisers conduct” would raise concerns about their own fiduciary duties to those they represent. ISS did not immediately respond to request for comment. Last month BHP said its board would recommend shareholders oppose the resolution at its annual general meetings in London on Oct. 17 and in Sydney on Nov. 7.

In June, the constitutional court ruled against a request to require community consultations for a planned copper and gold mine at Cascabel, potentially one of Ecuador’s biggest mining projects to date. In a statement on Thursday, SolGold said the constitutional court had also has ruled against a petition to seek local consultation on banning mining within the province of Azuay, southern Ecuador. Its shares were 5% higher at 0720 GMT. The province of Azuay contains SolGold’s 100% owned Sharug project, which SolGold says has considerable potential to be “a world class orebody”. “This decision, in conjunction with the previously rejected petition of a similar nature in the Imbabura province in northern Ecuador, sets a strong precedent for any future petitions for consultation to consider changes to the constitution of Ecuador,” SolGold said in a statement. It said it continued to work closely with the Ecuadorean government and with local communities to create a sustainable and responsible mining industry in Ecuador. In its ruling in June, the court said such a popular consultation was incompatible with the Andean country’s laws. Activists have expressed concern about Cascabel’s impact on the environment and sources of drinking water. President Lenin Moreno is seeking to boost foreign investment in Ecuador to spur the country’s sluggish economy and wean dependence on crude oil exports after a decade of populist rule under leftist predecessor Rafael Correa. In October last year, the world’s biggest miner BHP nearly doubled its stake in SolGold to around 11%. (Reporting by Barbara Lewis; editing by David Evans)"
6.93495744319378," Exxon Mobil puts Australian Bass Strait oil, gas assets up for sale MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp said on Wednesday it was looking to sell its 50% stake in the Gippsland Basin oil and gas development in Australia’s Bass Strait as part of a broader review of its global portfolio of assets. The sale could fetch up to $3 billion, however decommissioning costs for the aging fields could dent the price tag, analysts and bankers said. The Gippsland Basin joint venture, off the state of Victoria, has long been the mainstay oil and gas supplier for southeastern Australia, but output is in decline. “As a pivotal producer on the east coast...we would expect interest to be strong from domestic players that wish to gain greater exposure to rising gas prices,” said Angus Rodger, research director at consultants Wood Mackenzie. Operator Exxon’s 50-50 joint venture partner is BHP Group. The Melbourne-headquartered miner BHP declined to comment on whether it might sell its own stake or be interested in buying Exxon’s assets. “Exxon Mobil will be testing market interest for a number of assets worldwide, including its operated producing assets in Australia,” the company said in an emailed statement. “No agreements have been reached and no buyer has been identified,” it said, without disclosing any targeted value for a deal. Operations will continue as normal in the meantime, it said. The statement was released after the Gippsland Times newspaper reported company workers in Gippsland had been told by Exxon Mobil Australia Chairman Nathan Fay that the assets were on the market. Exxon said earlier this year it was looking to raise $15 billion from asset sales worldwide through 2021. BHP said in an emailed comment that it had been notified by Exxon of the latter’s plan to put its interests in the Gippsland Basin joint venture (GBJV) up for sale. “BHP recognizes the importance of GBJV to the reliable supply of gas to the east coast domestic market and we remain committed to maintaining that supply,” a BHP spokesman said in an emailed comment. BHP reported its share of output in the year to June 30 at 112 billion cubic feet of gas, 5.2 million barrels oil equivalent (mmboe) of crude oil and condensate and 5.4 mmboe of natural gas liquids. Potential bidders are likely to include other companies with assets in the Bass Strait, including Japan’s Mitsui & Co, Beach Energy and Cooper Energy, analysts and bankers said. Given the price, analysts said companies might bid in a consortium. Beach and Cooper declined to comment. Mitsui was not available for immediate comment. A purchase by Beach would be a “monster acquisition” and establish it “as a dominant east coast gas market leader”, Credit Suisse said in a note in January. Exxon’s move to sell its Gippsland Basin assets follows a disappointing drilling campaign in the Bass Strait last year in what had been seen as a promising gas prospect, and comes amid plans to drill more wells. “It’s not a major vote of confidence, because it would suggest they think the chances of adding to the reserves are fairly low,” said Graeme Bethune, chief executive of EnergyQuest, an industry consultancy. Exxon’s other producing asset in Australia is a 25% stake in the giant Gorgon liquefied natural gas project run by Chevron Corp in Western Australia, which is not part of the sale process. It sold its 50% stake in the undeveloped Scarborough gas project off Western Australia to Woodside Petroleum for up to $744 million last year."

Friedland, who is CEO of HPX as well as the founder and executive chairman of Ivanhoe Mines, has a long history of finding and developing remote mineral deposits in countries including Mongolia and Democratic Republic of Congo. HPX will take over stakes in consortium company Euronimba previously owned by BHP, Newmont Goldcorp, and French nuclear group Orano, the company said in a statement. Under the deal, HPX will give the Guinean government a 15% stake in the project through Euronimba subsidiary Société des Mines de Fer de Guinée (SMFG), as well as two seats on its board, a document seen by Reuters showed. Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed, but the document estimated the investment by HPX would amount to $1 billion dollars. “We are confident this project will be developed fast and well,” Guinea’s mines minister Abdoulaye Magassouba told Reuters after the signing ceremony also attended by President Alpha Condé. “We have a world-class partner committed to developing this exceptional deposit while taking into account the environmental sensitivity of the site.” Sources told Reuters late last month that Friedland was the front-runner to take over BHP’s 45.5% stake in Nimba. BHP had tried for years to sell its stake in the prospect, which does not fit its preference for operating in stable, developed economies. “Following the agreement between HPX and the Government of Guinea... BHP is divesting all of its interest in the project,” a spokesman for BHP said. Newmont Goldcorp, which also controlled a 45.5% stake, said the sale was part of its efforts to rationalise its portfolio and focus on its core business. French nuclear company Orano, which held a 9% stake in Euronimba, said it has been turning its focus to uranium deposits. HPX plans to bring a starter mine of one to five million tonnes per year into production “as quickly as possible” while feasibility studies are being completed for an expanded operation of at least 20 million tonnes per year, it said. The deal did not eliminate the possibility that some of the iron ore produced at Nimba, in southeast Guinea, could be taken to port through Liberia - a much shorter route than the government’s preferred route through Guinea to the west coast. The deal terms did, however, set out an extra tax on any iron ore taken through Liberia - of between $0.825 and $2 per tonne. Guinea’s government has separately insisted that the future developer of its giant Simandou iron ore deposit would have to export through Guinea by building a “trans-Guinean” railway to the west coast - a distance of around 650 km. The cost of this infrastructure has dampened miners’ enthusiasm for the project, but a government official told Reuters three large mining groups are in competition to develop two of Simandou’s four blocks through an international tender.

3.5895417694438105," BHP urges investors to veto resolution against coal lobbying MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Mining giant BHP Group Ltd urged shareholders on Thursday to vote against a resolution that would require the company to quit industry groups that lobby for policies inconsistent with the Paris climate change agreement. Several BHP shareholders, including the Church of England pension fund and the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR), proposed the resolution to the company this week ahead of its annual general meetings. In its filing, the ACCR noted an inconsistency between BHP’s “climate-aware positioning” and “the oppositional advocacy of its industry associations”, particularly in Australia, the world’s top coal exporter. This included coal friendly positions taken by the Minerals Council of Australia and coal body Coal21, such as calling for government subsidies for coal-fired power stations. BHP said its board would recommend shareholders vote against the resolution at the annual general meetings in London on Oct. 17 and in Sydney on Nov. 7. BHP was already reviewing its industry memberships and the policy positions taken by those groups since Jan. 2018, the company said in an exchange filing. “Responding to global warming remains a priority governance and strategic issue for BHP and the company will continue to take action,” BHP said in the filing. BHP conducted a review of its memberships in 2017 after ACCR, a body concerned with ethical investing, lodged a similar resolution, and quit the World Coal Association late that year. BHP noted scope changes in the 2019 review, which would also extend to coal lobby group Coal21. “The Board is being updated in relation to the review and will endorse the outcomes,” the company said."
5.2610063433669705," BHP investors file resolution to cut funding for Australian coal lobby groups MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Several BHP Group shareholders, including the Church of England pension fund, are recommending the company suspend its membership in industry groups that advocate for policies inconsistent with the Paris climate change agreement. The resolution was filed on Tuesday by the Australasian Centre for Corporate Responsibility (ACCR) ahead of BHP’s annual general meetings (AGM) in London and Sydney, the ACCR said in a statement. Co-filers included the Church of England Pensions Board and Grok Ventures, the private investment vehicle of Australian tech billionaire Mike Cannon-Brookes, as well as institutional investors that combined hold A$140 billion( $94.6 billion) under management. “While BHP positions itself as a climate champion, it continues to fund aggressive and effective lobbying to block climate policy, including via the Minerals Council of Australia and Coal21,” said ACCR Executive Director, Brynn O’Brien. BHP Chief Executive Officer Andrew Mackenzie said in July that the world’s biggest miner would invest $400 million over five years to reduce emissions, as it also became the first miner to pledge to tackle pollution caused when customers use its products. ACCR said the inconsistency between BHP’s climate-aware positioning and “the oppositional advocacy of its industry associations” was especially acute in Australia, the world’s biggest coal exporter. Industry groups like Minerals Council of Australia have repeatedly called for coal friendly policies, including government subsidies for coal-fired power stations, it said. Minerals Council of Australia chief executive Tania Constable said in a statement to Reuters on Wednesday that the group supported a transformation to a low emissions global economy. Australian mining businesses were working to reduce emissions from minerals extraction and processing, investing in low emissions technologies and increasing the user of renewable energy in their operations, she said. The ACCR lodged a similar resolution in 2017 that saw BHP review its membership of more than 20 industry associations and quit the World Coal Association. At the time, BHP pledged to review its membership of any groups that advocated for “material” differences in policy positions to its own that could impact public policy and where it did not otherwise see sufficient membership benefit. BHP has said that it can accomplish more with industry groups by being members but that it would keep its membership of groups and their policy positions under review. BHP’s upcoming London AGM is on Oct. 17 while its Sydney AGM is Nov. 7."

10.460293027111854," Talks on Guinea's iron ore advance, BHP nears deal on Nimba-sources * Guinean government insisting on development plan * Infrastructure, legal tangles have prevented development * Major mining personalities show interest in Guinea CONAKRY/LONDON, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Leading miner BHP is near a deal to divest its stake in Guinea’s Nimba iron ore deposit, while three big miners are vying to develop half of the country’s Simandou, the largest known untapped iron ore reserve, sources close to the talks said. Guinea has struggled for decades to extract money from its iron ore, which has been left undeveloped because of protracted legal disputes and the cost of infrastructure. BHP has also tried for years to sell its stake in the Nimba prospect, which does not fit the company’s preference for operating in stable, developed economies. Banking sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the price would be insignificant as BHP is keen to seal a deal. This year, a rise in iron ore prices following cyclone disruption in Australia and reduced output in Brazil after a Vale dam burst in January, combined with a resolution of one of the legal disputes that have blocked Simandou’s development, helped to revive interest in Guinea’s assets. In addition to interest in Simandou, there has also been a flurry of interest in smaller iron ore deposits near Guinea’s border with Liberia that theoretically could be exported via a much shorter link to the Liberian coast. Those seeking to develop them are big mining personalities: Mick Davis, chief executive of Britain’s ruling Conservative party and former Xstrata boss, Israeli billionaire Beny Steinmetz and another mining billionaire Robert Friedland, who leads HPX, a privately-owned U.S. corporation. Friedland is the front-runner to buy BHP’s stake in Mount Nimba, two sources said on condition of anonymity. BHP, Friedland and Newmont declined comment, as did Abdoulaye Magassouba, Guinea’s mining and geology minister. A Guinean source close to the talks said they were at “a very advanced stage,” while declining to give further details. In July, Guinea said it had launched a tender for two of Simandou’s four blocks. A government official said three large mining groups were in competition, but declined to name them. “We received requests from five companies, and in the end three large groups agreed to the terms of the deal and purchased access to the project data,” Sadou Nimaga, secretary-general of Guinea’s mines ministry, said. He added that they paid $300,000 for the access and have 45 days, starting from Aug. 19, to prepare bids, which a commission will judge. The winner has to provide assurances they will develop the deposit, not just leave it in the ground, Nimaga said. He also reiterated the government’s insistence that ore from Simandou would have to be exported via Guinea, which requires a 650 km railway to Guinea’s coast. The cost of building that link has previously hindered Simandou’s development. (Writing by Helen Reid and Barbara Lewis; editing by Emelia Sithole-Matarise)"
7.007546210398092," BHP chief to 'stick up for globalization' as trade tensions bite LONDON (Reuters) - The head of the world's biggest miner BHP BHPB.LBHP.AX said he will ""stick up for globalization"" and is more worried about the damage trade tensions are inflicting on the world economy than their impact on demand for the commodities BHP produces. BHP on Tuesday posted annual profit of $9.12 billion, a bumper figure built largely on selling iron ore, coal and copper to China, the world’s largest importer of commodities BHP shares were trading 1.6% lower by 1130 GMT, as despite record dividends, analysts said they had expected even better results. CEO Andrew Mackenzie told reporters in London protectionism was an act of economic self-harm. “Economically this is causing disruption and the partial unraveling of global supply chains,” Mackenzie said. “We’re not completely immune to some form of downturn and that’s why we’re nervous.” Asked whether commodity cycles had peaked, he said he did not know, adding the company was “anxious but ready”. Prices of iron ore, which represents nearly 50 percent of BHP’s core earnings, have fallen as the impact eases of supply disruption at the start of the year caused by a dam disaster in Brazil and extreme weather in Australia. Trade tensions between the United States and China have also impacted market sentiment. Mackenzie said he would stick up for the benefits of globalization and opposed moves toward greater intervention such as removing the independence of central banks. “The people advocating this are committing economic self-harm,” he said. U.S. President Donald Trump has repeatedly criticized the U.S. Fed, accusing it of undermining the administration’s economic policies."

The world’s biggest mining company, BHP Group, reports its highest profits in five years even as its top customer is engaged in a now protracted trade dispute with the world’s largest economy.

The final dividend of 78 U.S. cents a share was also slightly below expectations, but could be taken as a sign that BHP is holding back some cash because of the uncertainties ahead. BHP Chief Executive Andrew Mackenzie said the U.S.-China trade spat has yet to have a big impact on demand for the company’s commodities, but he is mindful of the risks. “There’s obviously been a slight cooling in appetite based on some of the concerns we have seen in the short-term for the global economy. We are not without some consideration as to what might be around the corner,” he said. Given that BHP, as well as global mining peers such as Rio Tinto, Brazil’s Vale and Anglo American , are heavily exposed to China’s appetite for commodities, it may be possible to conclude that the trade war hasn’t had that much of an impact. However, the likelihood is that the effect on the Chinese, U.S. and global economies is taking longer to show up, and there are early recession warning lights flashing, from inverted bond yield curves to slowing freight growth and weakening manufacturing indexes. China’s demand for commodities, especially iron ore and the coking coal used to make it into steel, has also been boosted by Beijing’s stimulus efforts, aimed at keeping the country’s economic growth above an annual 6% and offset the impact of weaker manufacturing exports. BHP and the other commodity producers find themselves in a tug-of-war between the attempts to stimulate the Chinese economy through infrastructure and construction spending, and the damage being inflicted by the escalating tariff war between Washington and Beijing. Beyond their limited lobbying abilities, the mining companies have no control over whether the trade dispute is resolved, or whether it morphs into a situation of effectively permanent trade barriers. They also have no control over whether China can keep the stimulus taps open wide enough to prop up economic growth, but not so wide as cause other problems such as further deterioration in credit quality. In some ways the trade dispute is coming down to a game of chicken between Beijing and Washington, with both seemingly currently betting that they can hold out longer than the other. The problem for U.S. President Donald Trump is that, unlike his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping, he is pushing for re-election in November next year and the last thing he needs is an economy entering a recession that his opponents will (mostly correctly) blame on his trade policies. For commodity producers such as BHP the old adage of “hope for the best, prepare for the worst” seems the logical corporate strategy. For investors this may mean a more cautious dividend policy, while for BHP and its peers, the chances are that the focus will once again return to cost-cutting and productivity improvements to ameliorate the potential impact of falling commodity prices."

7.007546210398092," Mining giant BHP pays record dividend, but flags global growth headwinds MELBOURNE (Reuters) - BHP Group posted its largest annual profit in five years and record full-year dividends, but its share price eased as the world’s biggest miner flagged global economic headwinds that could hit demand for its key commodities, iron ore and copper. Both profit and dividends slightly undershot expectations as BHP kept cash in its coffers in the face of risks to global economic growth such as the Sino-U.S. trade war and as costs rise at some of its operations. BHP shares edged down 0.4 cents to A$36.10 ($24.43) on Tuesday, while the broader Australian market was up slightly. “As a BHP shareholder you can’t be too disappointed. It’s been a great year for the company, they have made a lot of money,” said Brenton Saunders of Pendal Group in Sydney, a fund management firm that holds shares in the miner. “That’s in a large part a function of commodity markets and less so a function of the specifics of managing and running a business like this.” BHP on Tuesday announced a 78 cent dividend, meaning that it will hand back $3.9 billion to investors in addition to $17 billion already announced for the financial year that ended in June. That stemmed from the sale of its shale gas business and was helped by surging iron ore prices following supply outages in Brazil and Australia. “Most people were thinking around this level on dividends, but a lack of any additional returns may disappoint some,” said analyst Glyn Lawcock at UBS in Sydney. While the trade dispute between Washington and Beijing has dampened global economic growth, it has not yet affected Chinese demand for BHP’s commodities such as iron ore, copper and coal, said Chief Executive Andrew Mackenzie. “There’s obviously been a slight cooling in appetite based on some of the concerns we have seen in the short-term for the global economy. We are not without some consideration as to what might be around the corner,” he said, in reference to BHP’s lack of special dividend. Reports of stimulus efforts in China and Germany calmed fears of a severe downturn in the global economy on Tuesday that were stoked last week as bond yields fell. Mackenzie is six years into the top job at BHP and is expected to step down in the next year, leaving the next management team with a number of challenges. He said he did not expect Chinese steel demand to grow next year given already robust infrastructure spending and softening economic signals from developed economies. He also cited rising cost pressures, which were seen in petroleum as well as BHP’s Queensland coal division where costs rose by 2% over the financial year partly due to wet weather. “We believe capital returns from BHP have peaked for this cycle due to rising costs, gradually rising capex, lower realized prices, and a lack of proceeds from asset sales,” said Jefferies, which recently downgraded BHP to hold, in a report. Iron ore prices have tumbled this month as global supply has normalized, after outages and strong Chinese appetite for the steelmaking raw material caused the Dalian iron benchmark to more than double in the first-half of 2019. Mackenzie also said that BHP had its thermal coal operations under review. There has been some speculation in markets that the company could look to sell these operations. Underlying profit for the 12 months ended June 30 rose to $9.12 billion from $8.93 billion a year earlier, but still undershot expectations of $9.4 billion from a Vuma consensus of 18 analysts. Underlying profit is a measure of the company’s core performance excluding one-time gains and losses. But the company recorded $1 billion in productivity losses for fiscal 2019 on disruptions to production at its copper and iron ore operations."

6.099153470593577," BHP boosts nickel reserves by 77%, gears up for EV market MELBOURNE (Reuters) - BHP Group is expanding its nickel business and plans to ramp up sales for the fast-growing electric vehicle (EV) sector, Asset President Eddie Haegel said on Monday. Nickel West contributes just a fraction to BHP’s profit, accounting for just $42 million of underlying earnings in the December half-year, compared with $3.5 billion from its iron ore unit. After years on the block, BHP declared its nickel business core in May on the back of promising demand expectations from the electric vehicle industry. BHP, like its peers, is ploughing more investment into large-scale growth. However, it is no small feat for the world’s biggest miner to create a top-tier, low-cost business that can make an impact on its bottom line, according to analysts and investors. “The electrification of transport is certainly shaping our long-run view of nickel as an attractive commodity,” Haegel told the Diggers and Dealers mining conference in Western Australia. For higher Australian nickel volumes, BHP has been investing in exploration in new areas and around existing mines, as well as in debottlenecking for its Mt Keith concentrator, Kalgoorlie Nickel Smelter, and Kwinana refinery. “These pathways have the potential to create a BHP-scale business,” Haegel said, according to a copy of his speech. BHP has boosted its nickel reserves by 77% to 1.5 million tonnes this year, and has secured a 13,000 kilometer exploration area in Western Australia, roughly the size of Qatar, along the state’s southern coast. BHP Group plans to start production of nickel sulphate in the second quarter of next year, as it ramps up sales of its nickel products to the battery industry, Haegel said on Friday. As more EVs take to the road in coming years, each of them will carry higher nickel volumes, as makers transition to larger batteries and nickel-rich technology to allow for longer distances, taking market share from other battery types, Haegel said. Demand for the raw materials for EVs is expected to boom, although lithium miners have faced a rocky time this year after a supply glut hammered prices. A 60kilowatt hour nickel-manganese-cobalt (NMC811) battery needs 9kg of cobalt, 11kg of lithium and 70kg of nickel, he said. “Clearly, these changes will drive a significant increase in global nickel demand, but not just yet ... We do not expect to see a meaningful impact on the nickel market from batteries until the mid – late 2020s,” he said."
6.099153470593577," Australia's Mincor signs nickel supply deal with BHP (Reuters) - Australia’s Mincor Resources NL said on Monday it had signed a long term agreement with mining giant BHP Group to supply nickel concentrate. Under the deal, BHP’s Nickel West division will process up to 600,000 tonnes per annum of nickel sulfide at its Kalgoorlie smelter out to 2025 once Mincor has restarted its operations in December. Mincor put its mines on care and maintenance in February 2016 as London Metal Exchange nickel prices sank to decade lows below $8,000 a tonne. Prices have since recovered to around $15,450. The agreement comes amid BHP’s strategy to ramp up sales of its nickel products to the emerging battery industry and will alleviate some pressure on BHP to find replacement sources of feed. BHP’s long term supply deals with local nickel miners Western Areas and Independence Group are due to be renewed this year. The agreement replaces a 20-year old deal signed between the two miners. Mincor will get revenue from its sales of the nickel-in-concentrate to BHP at LME nickel prices."
6.099153470593577," RPT-Electric ambition: BHP eyes EV market with speciality chemicals (Repeats item issued late Friday) KWINANA, Australia, Aug 2 (Reuters) - BHP Group will face a test of its ability to move beyond bulk mining over the coming year with a foray into specialty chemicals for the battery industry at its once struggling Nickel West division. The global miner said on Friday it plans to start production of nickel sulphate in the second quarter of next year, a higher value, higher purity product for sale to customers throughout the electric vehicle (EV) supply chain. The move by the world’s biggest bulk miner - best known for iron ore and coal - underscores its efforts to position itself for a decarbonised world, which already relies on copper, another of its core commodities. Nickel West, which comprises mines, a smelter and a refinery producing nickel as powder or briquettes, is building what BHP expects will be the world’s largest nickel sulphate facility to provide material for lithium-ion batteries. Having tried for years to sell the business, its turnaround under the stewardship of Eddie Haegel has made it something of a poster child for efficiency within the company, according to one investor. It was elevated to “core” for growth in May. But analysts and industry experts say it faces challenges, not least moving BHP from a high volume, low cost producer of bulk commodities to a producer of top quality chemicals demanded by battery makers, and worries about short-term demand. Nickel’s medium term outlook is bright, driven by an expected boom in electric vehicle sales and a move towards nickel-rich batteries that can store more energy, giving a longer drive between charges. Demand for nickel from the battery supply chain is expected to double to 400,000 tonnes by 2025 from 200,000 tonnes this year, according to Wood Mackenzie, which is around 8 percent of the current global nickel market. In the short-term, however, an end to some of China’s EV subsidies in June has dampened demand throughout the EV battery supply chain, particularly for lithium. BHP’s new production, which is equivalent to 22,000 tonnes of nickel or 100,000 tonnes of sulphate, will add around 11 percent to the market just as other sulphate producers also start or raise output, including Indonesia’s QMB New Energy Materials, Papua New Guinea’s Ramu and Finland’s Terrafirme. First Quantum said this week it would restart its Western Australian Ravensthorpe nickel operations by Q1 2020 to produce a mixed hydroxide product (MHP) that is cheaper to turn into battery chemicals. BHP’s Haegel, says the miner will aim to match supply with demand and would flexible in what was “a very new, a very young market”. The miner was also confident it tap into its expertise in bulk products. “We think that integration is a competitive advantage, we think scale is a competitive advantage,” Haegel told a briefing at the plant on Friday. As battery makers move towards higher nickel-content cathodes, they look for extremely high purity metal. One seller of nickel sulphate, based in Asia, said that BHP’s existing metal products were not first choice for his customers because they took longer to process. “BHP Nickel briquette or powder is not a first purchase option for the nickel sulphate producer in Northeast Asia...

Analysts and investors said given its size and focus, the division could be a better fit for another owner if BHP chooses to revisit a sale. “By global standards, it’s a very material asset in the nickel sulphide world,” said Brenton Saunders of Sydney-based investment manager Pendal Group. “In the right hands, with the right cost structure it could be a great asset.” ($1 = 6.8792 Chinese yuan renminbi)"
-0.8906637607416791," Electric ambition: BHP eyes EV market with speciality chemicals KWINANA, Australia, Aug 2 (Reuters) - BHP Group will face a test of its ability to move beyond bulk mining over the coming year with a foray into specialty chemicals for the battery industry at its once struggling Nickel West division. The global miner said on Friday it plans to start production of nickel sulphate in the second quarter of next year, a higher value, higher purity product for sale to customers throughout the electric vehicle (EV) supply chain. The move by the world’s biggest bulk miner - best known for iron ore and coal - underscores its efforts to position itself for a decarbonised world, which already relies on copper, another of its core commodities. Nickel West, which comprises mines, a smelter and a refinery producing nickel as powder or briquettes, is building what BHP expects will be the world’s largest nickel sulphate facility to provide material for lithium-ion batteries. Having tried for years to sell the business, its turnaround under the stewardship of Eddie Haegel has made it something of a poster child for efficiency within the company, according to one investor. It was elevated to “core” for growth in May. But analysts and industry experts say it faces challenges, not least moving BHP from a high volume, low cost producer of bulk commodities to a producer of top quality chemicals demanded by battery makers, and worries about short-term demand. Nickel’s medium term outlook is bright, driven by an expected boom in electric vehicle sales and a move towards nickel-rich batteries that can store more energy, giving a longer drive between charges. Demand for nickel from the battery supply chain is expected to double to 400,000 tonnes by 2025 from 200,000 tonnes this year, according to Wood Mackenzie, which is around 8 percent of the current global nickel market. In the short-term, however, an end to some of China’s EV subsidies in June has dampened demand throughout the EV battery supply chain, particularly for lithium. BHP’s new production, which is equivalent to 22,000 tonnes of nickel or 100,000 tonnes of sulphate, will add around 11 percent to the market just as other sulphate producers also start or raise output, including Indonesia’s QMB New Energy Materials, Papua New Guinea’s Ramu and Finland’s Terrafirme. First Quantum said this week it would restart its Western Australian Ravensthorpe nickel operations by Q1 2020 to produce a mixed hydroxide product (MHP) that is cheaper to turn into battery chemicals. BHP’s Haegel, says the miner will aim to match supply with demand and would flexible in what was “a very new, a very young market”. The miner was also confident it tap into its expertise in bulk products. “We think that integration is a competitive advantage, we think scale is a competitive advantage,” Haegel told a briefing at the plant on Friday. As battery makers move towards higher nickel-content cathodes, they look for extremely high purity metal. One seller of nickel sulphate, based in Asia, said that BHP’s existing metal products were not first choice for his customers because they took longer to process. “BHP Nickel briquette or powder is not a first purchase option for the nickel sulphate producer in Northeast Asia... It takes more time to solvent (which leads to) less productivity and higher cost,” he said. Haegel acknowledged that BHP had received similar feedback that may be related to the density of BHP’s briquettes. “That hasn’t stopped people buying briquettes – sales continue to grow,” he said. “All I can point to is that we have had pretty exponential growth in our sales and our customers keep buying our product.” Nickel West currently contributes just a fraction to BHP’s profits, accounting for just $42 million of underlying earnings in the December half year, compared with $3.5 billion from iron ore.

-0.8906637607416791," BHP to start nickel sulfate production for EVs in second-quarter of 2020 KWINANA, Australia (Reuters) - BHP Group plans to start production of nickel sulfate in the second quarter of next year, as it ramps up sales of its nickel products to the battery industry, asset president Eddie Haegel said on Friday. BHP currently produces around 75,000 tonnes of nickel metal at its Kwinana refinery on the outskirts of Perth, which it sells mostly to chemicals makers in Asia who turn it into nickel sulphate, used to make batteries for electric vehicles (EVs). The miner, which in 2015 considered closing the plant due to a drop in demand from the stainless steel industry, is currently building what it expects to be the world’s biggest nickel sulfate facility to serve the EV battery market directly. Demand for the raw materials for electric vehicles is expected to boom as more EVs take to the road in coming years, although lithium miners have faced a rocky time this year after a supply glut hammered prices. “We anticipate that there will be no sustainable premium in the lithium sector, whereas we think that is not the case for nickel,” Haegel told a media briefing at the plant. “We think that in the medium to longer term there will be a margin that will be sticky for nickel, and so we consider it an attractive commodity.” Haegel said sales of nickel sulfate would generally be contracted on single or multi-year agreements, with a set premium on top of the London Metal Exchange nickel price. BHP initially plans to produce some 100,000 tonnes of nickel sulfate a year, containing the equivalent of around 22,000 tonnes of nickel, and will ramp up production in coming years. “We will be bringing in new supply which we obviously want to try to match with demand so we have got flexibility around the rate at which we ramp up. If we don’t put it into sulfate we put it into powder and briquettes,” he told a press briefing.” The miner could eventually triple capacity with potential second and third stage expansions, but work on creating a separate circuit at the facility to extract cobalt has been on the back burner due to weak nickel prices and a fire at BHP’s Kalgoorlie nickel smelter, he said. “We will end up selling ... to some car manufacturers, battery makers, and the cathode supply chain, that full cross section is very likely to happen,” he said. In a presentation, BHP said it sold about 78% of its nickel production to the battery industry in the second half of the 2019 financial year, up from just below 60% a year ago. Nickel is still a niche business for the world’s biggest miner, contributing just $42 million to underlying earnings in the December half year, compared with $3.5 billion from iron ore."

-13.333757743285993," BHP makes $400 million climate-change emissions pledge LONDON (Reuters) - Leading resources company BHP BHP.AXBHPB.L will invest $400 million over five years to reduce emissions, it said on Tuesday, becoming the first miner to pledge to tackle pollution caused when customers use its products. BHP is the world’s biggest listed miner and biggest coking coal producer. Combined with iron ore, also mined by BHP, coking coal is used to make steel, producing millions of tonnes of CO2. CEO Andrew Mackenzie said BHP would develop technology to curb emissions both inside and outside the company. From next year it will set a medium-term, science-based decarbonisation target, he said in a speech at an event organised by the Financial Times. “We won’t stop at the mine gate. We will also increase our focus on Scope 3 emissions,” he said. Emissions are divided into categories. Scope 1 and 2 cover an organisation’s direct emissions and indirect emissions generated by power it buys to run its operations. Scope 3 emissions occur when a company’s products are used, as in steelmaking. Oil major Shell RDSa.L has also pledged to address Scope 3 emissions, but many other resources companies have been reluctant to confront what is a huge problem. BHP says its Scope 3 emissions are estimated to be about 40 times greater than its Scope 1 and 2 emissions. ‘BREAKING OF RANKS’ Adam Matthews, director of ethics and engagement for the Church of England pension, a BHP investor, said Mackenzie’s position marked an important breaking of ranks. “The key will be in the ambition of the targets they set next year and also how this relates to the lobbying undertaken by the trade associations they fund,” Matthews said. BHP's closest rival, Rio Tinto RIO.LRIO.AX, has said Scope 3 emissions are caused by its customers, especially in China, and it has little control over them. In an interview, Mackenzie told Reuters he could not yet be specific about the new investment, but measures could include work on recycling. Some in the industry have criticised BHP for a focus on bulk commodities rather than minerals that are needed for electric vehicles, such as lithium and cobalt. Mackenzie said BHP concentrated on the commodities it knew best, including copper, which has a significant role in a lower-carbon economy because of its usefulness as a conductor of electricity. The company owns thermal coal mines, whereas Rio Tinto has sold off its thermal coal, thereby reducing one source of Scope 3 emissions. Mackenzie said that BHP’s thermal coal accounted for less than 3% of revenue and is low-cost, implying that it would be among the last to be closed down globally. “We would simply be transferring the Scope 3 emissions to someone else,” he said, though he added that this did not mean BHP would not decide to sell its thermal coal."
-13.333757743285993," Exclusive: Some Australian BHP investors push for external candidate for CEO MELBOURNE (Reuters) - At least three institutional investors in Australia are pushing for global miner BHP Group BHP.AXBHPB.L to consider external candidates to replace Andrew Mackenzie as new CEO, sources with direct knowledge of the matter said. The move highlights nascent investor pressure on the world’s biggest miner to consider drastic changes in management to tackle challenges such as cutting costs, an eventual return to lower iron ore prices, and rebuilding its reputation after a Brazil dam disaster. “We are quite firmly of the view that it needs to be an external candidate ... We just don’t see anybody internally that could make a material improvement to the status quo,” one of the three institutional investor sources said. “They pretty much miss every operational target they set, both in terms of costs and volumes, so it’s very hard to take new project proposals at face value,” the person said. The topic has gained traction in talks in Perth and Sydney in the past few weeks, two other investors said. Refinitiv data showed the three investors together hold less than a combined 1% stake in BHP, however funds’ positions are often held by different entities, so do not always show up in the data, one fund manager said. They all declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the subject. Speaking on the sidelines of an event in London, Mackenzie said ultimately a CEO appointment would be the decision of the board, but he said there were several people in his team he would be “more than happy to hand the baton on to”. He told Reuters in an interview nothing was imminent and he planned to stay in office to deal with the first part of a multi-decade agenda he has set for the company. “We have an enormous lever to take what I think is already sector-leading performance into something I think will be outstanding. I’ve been very much part of the design of that and I intend to lead the shorter term part of it,” he said, while declining to define short term. Mackenzie has been in the job for almost seven years. BHP hired its last external CEO in 1998 when it brought in Paul Anderson to reform the company, which he did by instigating its takeover of Anglo-South African Billiton. It is not immediately clear whether top BHP investors also share the view it needs substantial cultural change at the top management to give the miner the reform it needs. Investors in both BHP and Rio RIO.L have been showered with around $15 billion in buybacks and special dividends by each miner since the start of 2018, according to one estimate, largely as a result of asset sales and buoyant iron ore prices. “The company appears to have momentum on a one to two year view, and during the tenure of the current leadership team. It doesn’t look to add up to a pressing need to replace in the short term,” a top shareholder said. Norway’s $1 trillion sovereign wealth fund, a major shareholder in BHP Billiton, declined to comment. Activist shareholder Elliott Capital [ECAL.UL] and BlackRock also declined to comment. BHP's performance has improved in the past 12 months on the back of a change in chairman and the tailwind from rising iron ore prices that may mean Mackenzie could extend his run. BHP shares are up by a quarter this year and closed up 0.6% on the Australian Securities Exchange on Tuesday. Its London-listed shares BHPB.L were 1% higher by 1111 GMT. The company flagged $1 billion in productivity losses for fiscal 2019 in its quarterly production report last week flowing from disruptions to operations across its commodities. “It is ... felt by investors that there is substantial cultural change that can be effected in order to achieve this and in time it will require a change of management to make this happen,” said a second institutional investor source. They pointed to Nev Power who was instrumental in turning Fortescue Metals FMG.AX into the world's fourth-largest - and lowest-cost - iron ore producer in under a decade, or Newcrest's NCM.AX Sandeep Biswas as possible candidates. “Nev is held in high regard for having achieved this through his career,” the second source said."
-13.333757743285993," BHP to invest $400 million to curb climate-changing emissions LONDON, July 23 (Reuters) - The world’s biggest listed miner BHP said on Tuesday it would invest $400 million over five years to reduce emissions from its own operations and from those generated by the use of its resources. BHP is the biggest producer of coking coal, which is used with iron ore, also mined by BHP, to make steel in a process responsible for millions of tonnes of CO2. At a speech in London, BHP CEO Andrew Mackenzie was due to say the company’s “climate investment programme” would scale up technology to help decarbonise the company’s own operations and drive investment in curbing downstream emissions. “We must take a product stewardship role for emissions across our value chain and commit to work with shippers, processors and users of our products to reduce scope 3 emissions,” he was expected to say, according to advance extracts of his comments. Emissions are divided into categories. Scope 1 and 2 cover direct emissions by an organisation and indirect emissions generated by power it buys to run its operations. Scope 3 emissions are caused when a company’s products are used, for instance in steel-making or when they are shipped to customers. BHP’s investment is the equivalent of roughly 5% of its most recent full-year underlying profits, announced last August, of $8.93 billion. BHP stands apart from others in the mining sector with its target of net zero emissions by the second half of the century, in line with U.N. carbon-cutting goals. It was expected to say on Tuesday it wished to go further and establish a medium-term, science-based target for scope 1 and 2 emissions. Other measures will include strengthening an existing link between emissions performance and executive pay. (Reporting by Barbara Lewis; Editing by Alison Williams)"
-15.200281351899312," BHP aims to cut thermal coal output for next year, raise quality MELBOURNE (Reuters) - The world’s biggest miner, BHP Group, on Wednesday said it planned to produce less thermal coal in the coming financial year and that it would wash it instead as part of a drive to raise the quality of the commodity. BHP said its New South Wales Energy coal production would fall as much as 18% to between 15-17 million tons next year, down from 2019 levels of 18 million tons. The lower production will come after BHP optimized its mine plan “to focus on higher quality products”, it said in its latest quarterly production report. Thermal coal, used as fuel for power plants, can be processed to increase its energy content, boosting the value of the final product and cutting carbon emissions. The process can turn thermal coal into a semi-soft coking coal which then feeds steel producers. BHP’s Australian thermal coal operations include the Mt Arthur open cut mine in the Hunter Valley region of New South Wales, which supplies domestic and international customers. AME Group analyst Lloyd Hain said that coal from BHP’s Mt Arthur operation is typically lower-grade coal, with an energy content rating of 5,500 kilocalories per kilogram (Kcal), such as is often bought by China. “They (BHP) are trying to diversify out of their current market, and there is potentially more price upside for (higher grade) thermal coal,” he said. Raising the energy content to 6,000 Kcal would allow BHP to sell to markets like Japan and South Korea, which would improve the value of Mt Arthur if BHP were to decide to sell the asset, Hain added. BHP is not the only miner seek to move away from lower-grade, lower-priced thermal coal. Yancoal Australia said in its quarterly report late on Tuesday that it “continued to optimize” its split of thermal and coking coal sales “to meet the market demand and maximize prices”. Yancoal sells to Japan, South Korea and China, each representing 22% of total sales volume or less. It said that “the impediment to Australian thermal coal deliveries into China continued to influence the regional market” in the June quarter. Australia’s thermal coal exports to China have fallen this year as political tensions flared between the countries after Australia banned China’s Huawei from participating in the build-out of Australia’s 5G telecommunications network. Elsewhere, Whitehaven Coal said on an analyst call last week that it was looking to wash more thermal coal from its Maules creek operations to turn it into semi-soft coking coal, which it has been successfully trialing with Indian steelmakers."

BHP met its revised target for iron ore production, but flagged $1 billion in productivity losses for fiscal 2019 in its quarterly production report, flowing from disruptions to operations across its commodities. The Anglo-Australian miner’s iron ore output fell to 71 million tonnes during the fourth-quarter ended June 30, compared with 72 million tonnes a year earlier. The figure was below a UBS estimate of 72.6 million tonnes, but up 12 percent on the March quarter. Production across its suite of commodities broadly recovered from March, which is typically the weakest quarter due to Australian weather conditions. “Generally speaking, it’s just a little bit softer than we expected, although it’s strong sequentially,” said analyst Glyn Lawcock at UBS in Sydney. “If you look at their guidance it’s highlighting that they aren’t really growing their volumes, so that means price is key going into next year.” Miners have benefited from iron ore prices at five-year highs, after a dam disaster in Brazil led to a global shortage of the steel-making ingredient. Analysts expect some of the windfall profits to be passed on to shareholders when Australian miners report their profits next month. BHP forecast iron ore production at 273 million to 286 million tonnes for the 2020 fiscal year, a 1%-6% increase from 2019 production of 270 million tonnes, which was slightly down from 275 million tonnes for 2018. The iron ore shortage was exacerbated after Cyclone Veronica tore down the coast of Western Australia in March, hitting several iron ore export hubs, in a return of more turbulent weather after several moderate years. BHP was on track with its growth projects, Lawcock noted, after Rio Tinto flagged a cost blow out at its key growth copper project in Mongolia when it reported on Tuesday. The $1 billion in productivity losses followed flooding in Australia’s Queensland state that hit BHP’s metallurgical coal operations, as well as changes to its Nickel West mine plan and higher costs in thermal coal, it said. That added to disruptions mostly at its Australian operations in the first half that included an acid plant outage Olympic Dam, a fire at its Kalgoorlie nickel smelter, and a train derailment. The figure did not include disruptions from Cyclone Veronica BHP said. In other metals BHP forecast around a 9-4 percent decline in petroleum production and growth of 1-8 percent in copper over the next financial year. It forecast a decline in energy coal output."

BHP, which operates 67 tailings facilities, said on Friday it has set up a tailings taskforce to further improve its focus on internal dam management and boost safety. The world’s biggest miner added that a review undertaken to assess the management of tailings facilities following the 2015 Samarco disaster, which killed 19 people, had identified no immediate concerns regarding dam integrity. The collapse of Vale SA’s Brumadinho dam in Brazil in January that killed over 200 people also raised questions about the safety of tailings dams around the world. Anglo American on Friday also published details of its 91 managed tailings storage facilities (TSFs) and additional 62 facilities at its joint venture operations, and said it was working on technologies to reduce the volume of waste materials produced. Glencore launched a page on its website that gave detailed information of its TSFs and said that Klohn Crippen Berger, one of the world’s leading experts on TSF assurance, independently audits and assesses the integrity and safety of the company’s TSFs. Earlier this year, the International Council on Mining and Metals (ICMM), an industry trade group whose members include Glencore, BHP and 25 others, said a committee will review and set standards for tailings dam design and maintenance by the end of the year. ICMM said in March it was working with the United Nations Environment Programme and the Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) to develop new standards for tailings dams. The PRI brings together ethical investors, including the Church of England, overseeing around $80 trillion worth of investments. In April, ethical investors working on a global standard for tailings dams had written to 683 listed resource companies, including major miners, asking for information to be made public within 45 days about every facility they control.

-8.713290583048112," Global miner BHP plans to expand nickel output amid battery boom MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Global miner BHP Group on Wednesday said it plans to expand its nickel sulphide operations amid an expected boom in demand for the material in electric vehicle batteries. But the company is not looking to produce main battery ingredient lithium as it sees such output having slimmer profits. Speaking at a strategy briefing on long-term asset allocation, BHP Chief Financial Officer Peter Beaven said growth in nickel could come from either exploration or acquisitions. “We are interested in adding more nickel sulphide resources to our portfolio, so we should continue to add exploration options in these areas,” he said. “We do not need to do M&A, but we never discount it as a way to acquire great resource bases.” The world’s biggest miner earlier this month said it had decided to hold on to its Nickel West operations in the state of Western Australia, which it had previously put up for sale. Nickel is in demand to allow electric cars to travel further on a single charge. Using more nickel also cuts costs by reducing the use of expensive cobalt, a mainstay of current EV batteries. Miners of nickel sulphide in Western Australia that could feed BHP’s operations, as well as being potential takeover targets, include Western Areas Ltd, Independence Group, Panoramic Resources, Mincor and Cassini Resources Ltd. However, Vice President of Strategy Paul Perry said BHP was not looking to move into lithium, expecting profits in that sector to be hit as more supply comes online in the wake of cheaper production techniques. “The available economic profit ... in that industry for the next couple of decades really isn’t there,” he said. BHP’s battery strategy marks a contrast to rival Rio Tinto, which has a huge but still undeveloped lithium deposit, Jadar, in Serbia. Beaven also said that BHP needed more options for growth in copper and oil, but was unlikely to add significant new capacity in iron ore or metallurgical coal beyond increases that come from improved productivity."

Cyclone Veronica tore down the coast of Western Australia in March, hitting several iron ore export hubs, in a return of more turbulent weather conditions after several moderate years. The lower production also led to a rise in BHP’s costs, while Rio Tinto suffered operational issues in the first quarter, including a fire at its Cape Lambert operations, said Brenton Saunders, an analyst at fund Pendal Group in Sydney. Miners, however, are benefiting from a surge in iron ore prices to near five-year highs on supply concerns following cyclone Veronica and a fatal dam collapse in Brazil that has cut operations at the world’s No. 1 iron ore miner Vale SA. “If the iron ore price wasn’t $96 and looking like it was going to go higher, then we would be having a very different conversation about these companies’ performance,” Saunders said. BHP, which put its fiscal 2019 iron ore production under review following the cyclone, lowered its forecast to 265 million-270 million tonnes, from 273 million-283 million tonnes. Iron ore output for the three months to end-March fell 5 percent to 64 million tonnes, down from 67 million tonnes a year ago. Rio Tinto, the world’s No. 2 iron ore miner, on Tuesday reported a 14 percent drop in quarterly iron ore shipments and trimmed its 2019 shipments estimate. BHP also increased its full-year production costs to less than $15 a ton, from less than $14 a ton previously, due to lower volumes and increased remediation costs. Since selling its onshore U.S. oil business last year, BHP is focused on just four commodities - iron ore, copper, coal and offshore oil and gas. The miner posted an 8 percent drop in quarterly copper production against year ago levels, mainly due to lower output at the world’s biggest copper mine, Escondida in Chile. However, it maintained annual production guidance for copper at 1.65 million tonnes to 1.74 million tonnes."

Last week, BHP Chief Financial Officer Peter Beaven revealed plans of cuts of up to 20 percent to his 900-strong finance team at an internal town hall meeting, the newspaper said. BHP’s technology group will also face cuts in workforce as part of a restructuring that could see up to 30 percent of its 2000 Australian and Singaporean workforce leave the group, according to the report. The cuts are not targeted at the workforce operating BHP’s global mines but will be part of its restructuring of “functional” sections in an attempt to streamline their operations, The Australian reported. BHP did not respond to a Reuters request for comment on Saturday. On Tuesday, the company had said initial estimates indicated its iron ore production would take a hit of about 6 million to 8 million tonnes after disruption and damage caused by tropical cyclone Veronica last week.

8.168227498133653," Rio Tinto, BHP Group restart some operations after cyclones MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Miners Rio Tinto and BHP Group said on Tuesday they had begun to resume operations at some facilities that had been halted as two separate cyclones battered Australia’s northern coastline over the weekend. Tropical Cyclone Veronica pummeled iron ore export ports on the northern coast of Western Australia before weakening and gradually moving west. Meanwhile, Cyclone Trevor landed in northern Queensland and then moved into the Gulf of Carpentaria where it made landfall before being downgraded to a low-pressure system on Sunday. Rio Tinto said on Tuesday that staff were returning to its ports and rail operations in Western Australia and that mining was resuming at its Robe Valley operations in the state. “With weather clearing, staff will gradually start returning to affected port and rail sites today with normal operations to resume once it is safe to do so,” Rio said. In a separate statement, it said operations at its bauxite mine in Weipa, Queensland, have been ramped back up after they were closed last Wednesday ahead of the bad weather. Bauxite is the raw material used to make aluminum. “Rio Tinto Weipa Operations have returned to normal activities with both ports fully operational by Sunday afternoon,” it said in an emailed statement. The miner noted that there were no injuries to employees or contractors as a result of the cyclone in Weipa. It did not give any estimate for any production that may have been impacted. Meanwhile, BHP Group said that it had found no major damage to its iron ore operations as clean-up work and systems and equipment safety checks were underway at Port Headland. “Our employees and contractors have commenced returning to work in preparation for production to recommence. We expect to restart loading ships today with production ramping up over the next few days,” BHP said in statement. The Pilbara Ports Authority, which operates the iron ore exporting ports of Port Hedland and Ashburton, said in a statement it had reopened both sites following infrastructure assessments. There was no significant infrastructure damage at either port and operations would return to normal in the next 24 hours, it added. Iron ore producer Fortescue Metals Group Ltd said its Port Hedland sites experienced minor flooding but its mining and processing operations continued unaffected over the weekend. It added that a return to shipping operations was underway."

5.306515770545243," BHP to drill more wells in Trinidad after gas finds (In March 13 item, corrects location of Bongos-2 well to north, from south, in paragraph 4) HOUSTON (Reuters) - BHP Group Ltd has stepped up exploration drilling in deep water off Trinidad and Tobago hunting for gas which could supply the country’s Atlantic LNG (liquefied natural gas) plant in the 2020s, a senior executive said. The company expects to complete drilling of three wells in block 14, located in its northern contract area, by the middle of this year, Niall McCormack, BHP’s vice president for exploration, said on the sidelines of the CERAWeek energy conference in Houston. “It’s an attractive opportunity so we’re looking to de-risk it a bit more, so we’ve got a bit more drilling to do,” he said. The company struck gas at the Bongos-2 well in the north last year. BHP is the operator of the block with a 70 percent stake while BP Plc holds the remainder. BHP has also found natural gas in two of three wells it drilled in its southern contract area last year. The company operates the southern area with a 65 percent stake and Royal Dutch Shell Plc has a 35 percent stake. “Overall, it’s an area where gas is attractive because it’s advantaged by the infrastructure of Atlantic LNG,” McCormack said. The gas could be produced in the middle of next decade when there would be demand from Atlantic LNG, he said. Trinidad’s Atlantic LNG, owned by BP, Shell, China’s sovereign wealth fund CIC and Trinidad’s state-owned company NGC, operates four LNG units with a total capacity of 15 million tonnes per year. However the plant has been running below capacity for several years, due to depleting supply from mature gas fields off Trinidad, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said in a report last September."

Barring miners, most sectors were in the green as weak economic growth data on Wednesday fuelled speculation over a possible rate cut by the Reserve Bank to stimulate activity. Australia’s trade surplus was higher than expected in February, data showed on Thursday. Commodities account for a bulk of the country’s exports, with China serving as a large market for raw materials. Financials, the heaviest sector on the index, were higher on strength in the country’s big four banks. National Australia Bank rose 1 percent after it named interim Chief Executive Philip Chronican as its new chairman after strong criticism from a financial sector inquiry prompted his predecessor to resign. The financial subindex rose about 0.4 percent, and touched a five-month high. Energy stocks were also higher as large oil and gas shares tracked a general uptrend in oil prices. Woodside Petroleum, the largest stock on the subindex, rose about 0.6 percent, while Oil Search rose 0.9 percent. On the other hand, mining stocks were the biggest drag on the benchmark, with the sector subindex losing as much as 1 percent. BHP Group and Rio Tinto, the largest miners on the ASX 200, fell about 0.7 percent and 4.5 percent, respectively. Rio Tinto was also the worst performer on the ASX 200. Rio Tinto had declared a bumper final and special dividend last month, while BHP had maintained its interim payout. Manganese miner South32 also traded ex-dividend, dropping as much as 1.8 percent. Metal miners were also pressured by a slight easing in commodity prices.

-0.015609099249013492," BHP's 'transformation agenda' sees raft of executive changes (Reuters) - BHP Group Ltd, the world’s biggest miner, announced a raft of management changes on Thursday, in line with its “transformation agenda” led by Chief Executive Andrew Mackenzie. The executive-level changes at BHP include the appointment of a chief commercial officer and the resignation of its president of petroleum operations. Mackenzie late last year set up a so-called transformation office that reports directly to him to help with the next phase of growth and maximize the productivity of operations. The global miner said Vandita Pant will on July 1 assume the role of chief commercial officer, taking over from 25-year veteran Arnoud Balhuizen.

0.4210736590322933," BHP first-half 2019 profit drops on rising costs, missed savings (Reuters) - BHP Group, the world’s biggest miner, on Tuesday reported a drop in first-half 2019 profit as a decline in copper earnings and a series of output disruptions boosted costs and resulted in missed opportunities for cost savings. BHP kicked off the reporting season for global majors and was expected to post slightly weaker results due to the outages at its Australian and Chilean operations. Declining ore quality at Escondida in Chile, the world’s largest copper mine, led to higher costs as the miner had to process more ore, while falling prices also stunted copper earnings. Underlying profit from continuing operations for the six months that ended on Dec. 31 fell to $4.03 billion, down 8 percent from $4.40 billion in the same period the year before, the company said in a statement. That missed consensus estimates compiled by Vuma Financial of $4.209 billion. Underlying profit measures a company’s performance exclusive of one-time gains and losses. “It was a sloppy result,” said analyst David Lennox at Fat Prophets in Sydney. “Unit costs have risen quite substantially and above guidance. I’m disappointed with the growth across the board, and that they are forecasting flat productivity gains for this year.” The company cut its guidance for a second time on the amount of cost savings it expected to generate during the 2019 financial year because of higher productivity. In August, the company expected productivity gains of $1 billion during the financial year, down from an earlier forecast of $2 billion. However, on Tuesday, the company cut its forecast for productivity gains to flat for the financial year. The guidance cut was mainly because of $460 million in savings that were not achieved because of unplanned production outages at Olympic Dam, Western Australia Iron Ore, Spence and Nickel West. BHP’s costs for the half-year period for its iron ore unit were $14.51 a tonne based on exchange rates during the period versus a forecast of less than $14. At Escondida, costs were $1.17 a tonne against earlier guidance of less than $1.15. Chief Executive Officer Andrew Mackenzie said that BHP set up late last year a transformation office that reports directly to him to help with the next phase of growth. “I think there is an awful lot more that is possible in terms of transforming this company to really deliver a stable set of operations where everything runs like a Swiss watch. That will inevitably lift production, make us safer, and reduce unit costs,” he said on a media call. Last month, BHP said its second-quarter iron ore production fell 9 percent after it was forced to derail an iron ore-cargo train after it ran away en route to a key shipping hub. Earnings before income tax, depreciation and amortization from copper fell nearly 40 percent in the first half. However, the miner slightly raised its 2019 copper production forecast to between about 1.6 million tonnes and 1.7 million tonnes. BHP said it cut net debt to $9.9 billion during the period, below its $10 to $15 billion target. BHP declared an interim dividend of $0.55 per share, the same as last year. Revenue from continuing operations rose 1 percent during the period to $20.74 billion."

The move comes about a month after London-listed oil and gas major BP discovered further oil prospects in the Gulf of Mexico, including additional oil in the Atlantis field. BP said the total cost of developing the project would be around $1.3 billion. BP has a 56 percent interest in the Atlantis field, while BHP holds the remaining 44 percent. First production for the project is expected in 2020, BHP said in a statement, and is expected to increase production by about 38,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day at its peak. BHP said it had also approved $256 million in funding for additional drilling and study at its 60 percent-held Trion field in Mexico. The Mexican government-owned PEMEX holds the rest of Trion.

10.905186755462566," Australia wins appeal against BHP over tax owed by marketing arm MELBOURNE, Jan 29 (Reuters) - Australia’s federal court ruled against BHP Group Ltd on Tuesday over whether the global miner should pay tax in Australia on profits made by its marketing arm on the sale of commodities owned by the company’s UK side, BHP Group Plc. BHP, which has a dual sharemarket listing in Australia and the UK, was considering whether to appeal the decision to the High Court of Australia, a spokesman said. The tax office says BHP owes A$82 million ($59 million) in “top-up” tax for 2006 to 2015 on sales of commodities, now mostly energy coal, from BHP Group Plc’s Australian subsidiaries, made through the group’s marketing arm, BMAG, according to BHP’s 2018 annual report. As a result of the judgment by the full bench of the Federal Court, 58 percent of BMAG’s profits from the sale of commodities from BHP Group Plc would be subject to Australian for the years since 2006. The judgment overturned an earlier ruling by a tax tribunal that had backed some of BHP’s objections to the tax assessment. The Australian Taxation Office declined to comment on its win on Tuesday, given the case could still be subject to further court action. The fight is separate from a transfer pricing dispute with the tax office which BHP settled last November for about A$529 million, ending a battle over whether the company had been avoiding tax by basing its marketing arm in Singapore. As part of that settlement, from 2020 onward, 100 percent of BMAG’s profits from the sale of Australian commodities from the BHP Group Plc side will be subject to Australian tax.

10.905186755462566," Brazil dam disaster may delay Samarco settlement for BHP, Vale MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Brazil’s deadly tailings dam collapse is likely to complicate a settlement for a similar disaster less than four years ago at the Samarco iron ore mine, owned jointly by Vale SA and BHP Group, investors said on Tuesday. Vale and BHP have been aiming to restart the mine as early as 2020 following a dam failure in 2015 that killed 19 people and buried a village. A second deadly dam burst at a Vale mine on Friday killed 65 people and there are fears the death toll could soar into the hundreds. The Brazilian prosecutor running talks to settle a lawsuit over the Samarco collapse told Reuters on Saturday the second dam burst could scramble those sensitive negotiations. Federal prosecutor Jose Adercio Sampaio said that depending on Vale’s culpability in the new disaster, it may change how his task force handles a 155 billion reais ($41 billion) case against Samarco. The case is currently suspended amid negotiations for a potential settlement. A restart at Samarco Mineracao SA depends on talks with prosecutors on building a new tailing dam system and a restructuring of the company’s debt, executives at BHP and Vale have said. BHP said on Tuesday that Samarco’s operations will only restart if it is safe, economically viable and has the support of the community and regulators. It said Samarco has not yet reached an agreement with its lenders on the restructuring of its unsecured financial obligations. The latest dam failing could draw out any settlement for Samarco and potential mine restart, investors said. “In terms of remediation, it’s clearly a very sensitive time to be trying to resolve it. So now it’s just another thing to try and work through,” said Andy Forster, senior investment officer with Argo Investments in Sydney. However, the fallout for BHP was likely to be limited. “It’s obviously an ongoing issue - while they do still have minority interest in Samarco, they wear these potential liabilities when they occur,” said Jason Teh, Chief Investment Officer at Vertium Asset Management in Sydney. “Samarco is quite small in terms of BHP’s operations. It’s a small proportion of its total business.

The world’s biggest miner said unplanned production outages at Olympic Dam, Spence and Western Australia Iron Ore are likely to negatively impact productivity and flagged that it would revise guidance at its results on Feb 19. The miner also raised its 2019 copper production forecast to between about 1.6 million tonne and 1.7 million tonne bolstered by the retention of Cerro Colorado copper mine in Chile, after a sale to private equity house EMR Capital fell through. “Yes, iron ore output might have been a little softer but overall I’d say production was broadly in line,” said a fund manager in Melbourne who declined to be named. “I’d think about the $600 million as more of an opportunity cost that we knew about from earlier in the quarter.” BHP’s iron ore output declined to 66 million tonnes during the three months ended Dec. 31, compared with 72 million tonnes a year ago, hurt by a forced train derailment that caused a supply disruption. The mining giant had said in November that it expected some interruption to its Australian iron ore exports after it was forced to derail a cargo train loaded with the commodity after it ran away en route to a key shipping hub. The Anglo-Australian miner has so far maintained its fiscal 2019 guidance of 273-283 million tonne of iron ore from its Western Australian operations. In other metals, BHP’s copper output fell 3 percent at 416,000 tonnes in the quarter, hurt by planned maintenance as well as outages. BHP also flagged a $700 million first-half impact due to higher Australian and Chilean income tax payments than last year, and the settlement of an Australian transfer pricing dispute. The state of Western Australia said on Monday that it was in talks with the miner after an audit had found that BHP had underpaid royalties on iron ore shipments sold via its Singapore marketing hub stretching back over more than a decade."
19.065734359090936," Australia Federal Court narrows BHP's suits over Samarco disaster MELBOURNE (Reuters) - The Federal Court of Australia on Tuesday ordered that the number of class-action lawsuits against BHP Group over a Brazilian mine collapse be narrowed to one from three. BHP is facing legal challenges over the 2015 collapse of the Fundao tailings dam, which stored mining waste at a mined owned by the Samarco joint venture between BHP and Brazilian iron ore mining giant Vale. The disaster killed 19 and spilled about 40 million cubic meters of sludge over communities and into the Rio Doce river and the Atlantic Ocean. The Federal Court ruled that a class action suit led by Vince Impiombato, filed in the state of Victoria, could proceed. The suit claims that Impiombato, a former BHP shareholder, sustained losses stemming from deceptive conduct and failures in continuous disclosure requirements. Additionally, the court placed a permanent stay, or hold, on a class action led by an Australian retirement fund and a temporary stay on a suit brought by the Los Angeles County Employees Retirement Association until Sept. 1, 2019, in order to cut costs and reduce court overlap since the allegations were similar. Impiombato is represented by specialist law firm Phi Finney McDonald, and funded by litigation company KTMC Funding LLC. A BHP spokesman said the company was defending the claim. BHP still faces lawsuits in other jurisdictions. Last month, SPG Law, a British offshoot of a U.S. litigator, filed three legal claims for unlimited damages over the Fundao dam failure in a court in the English city of Liverpool. In June, Samarco [SAMNE.UL], Vale SA and BHP signed a deal with Brazilian authorities to settle a 20 billion reais ($5.30 billion) lawsuit related to the failure. The miner also agreed to fund a total of $211 million in financial support for the Renova Foundation, created to help victims of the Samarco dam disaster in Brazil. In July, BHP said it expected to record a charge of $650 million in its fiscal 2018 results on account of the failure. The charge was at the lower end of expectations according to analysts."

A series of weak economic data from Europe and China, Australia’s largest trading partner, intensified global growth worries, although caution prevailed ahead of the U.S. Federal Reserve’s key policy meeting scheduled for the next two days. The S&P/ASX 200 index fell 0.2 percent, or 9.3 points to 5,592.7 by 0023 GMT. The benchmark dropped 1.1 percent on Friday. Financial stocks slid 1 percent with the country’s Big Four banks leading the losses. Australia and New Zealand Banking Group was down the most, about 2.4 percent, while National Australia Bank fell 1.4 percent. “We saw pretty strong pressure on financial stocks in U.S. and European trading. There are concerns that changes to the global growth outlook would mean banks are likely to be less profitable and that is not surprising given the leverage that banks have to the overall economic cycle,” said Michael McCarthy, chief strategist at CMC Markets and Stockbroking. However, despite the global negative leads, mining stocks which are highly exposed to China were boosted by mining behemoth BHP Group, which added 1.4 percent. The miner announced a special dividend of $1.02 per share and the completion of its off-market share buyback, as part of its promise to return $10.4 billion to shareholders from the sale of its U.S. shale business. Shares of fellow miner Mineral Resources soared as much as 5.6 percent to a near two-week high on the back of news after market hours on Friday that it had finalised an agreement to form a lithium joint venture with U.S.-based Albemarle for $1.15 billion. “Overall we are looking at a negative tone to trading but the caution means we are unlikely to run away with it,” McCarthy added. In other news, Australia’s government forecast the strongest budget outlook in 10 years, possibly making room for tax cuts ahead of elections in less than six months. New Zealand’s benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index dropped 0.5 percent or 41.19 points to 8,681.32, with the country’s largest banks, subsidiaries of Australia’s powerful lenders, leading the losses. On Friday, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand said it was considering almost doubling the required capital banks would need to hold to bolster the financial system’s capacity to handle any shocks.

The train, which was on BHP’s private Mount Newman railway line in the Pilbara in the northwest of the state of Western Australia, rode on without a driver for 92 km at around 100 km per hour before being derailed by the company’s remote operations center in Perth. “Our initial findings show that the emergency air brake for the entire train was not engaged as required by the relevant operating procedure,” BHP’s Western Australia Iron Ore President Edgar Basto said in a statement. “In addition, the electric braking system that initially stopped the train, automatically released after one hour while the driver was still outside,” he said. Integration of the back-up braking system had also failed, BHP said, therefore, for safety reasons, the company chose to derail the train intentionally because it could not be stopped with the braking system. “As a result of these initial findings, we put in place a range of safety controls. Following this, we safely restarted our rail operations,” Basto said. Investigations by regulators are continuing."
9.789626483007646," Chile copper output hits 4.25 mln tonnes thru September, up 7.3 y/y - Cochilco SANTIAGO, Nov 8 (Reuters) - Chile’s copper production from January to September this year jumped 7.3 percent from a year earlier, boosted by a sharp increase in production at BHP’s Escondida copper mine. Chile, the world’s top copper exporter, produced 4.25 million tonnes of copper in the first nine months of 2018. Escondida, in northern Chile, produced 950,900 tonnes through September, up 57.8 percent from the same period in 2017, when a strike shut down the mine for more than 40 days. Production from state-run miner Codelco’s deposits reached 1.29 million tonnes between January and September, a drop of 2 percent, with downturns at almost all its facilities. The country’s second-largest mine by output — Collahuasi, owned by Anglo American Plc and Glencore Plc — ramped up production by 5.8 percent to 401,800 tonnes.

9.789626483007646," BHP to meet iron ore commitments despite train derailment: CEO MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Global miner BHP Billiton will meet its iron ore commitments to customers despite a supply disruption after it had to derail a runaway ore train in Western Australia, Chief Executive Andrew Mackenzie said on Thursday. The miner suspended its rail operations after the incident on Monday that wrecked track and left a locomotive and wagons upturned nearly 120 km (75 miles) south of Australia’s iron ore export hub of Port Hedland. Asked whether BHP would invoke force majeure, Mackenzie told media after the company’s annual general meeting in South Australia that he did not expect the miner would let down any of its customers. “We will have the ability to supply our customers as we have been contracted to do,” Mackenzie said. Force majeure is a clause in a contract that allows either party not to fulfil the contract terms when they are affected by an extraordinary event or circumstance beyond their control. BHP said this week it would use stockpiles at Port Hedland to maintain its port operations, but that the reserves were not expected to cover the entire period of disruption. “We have got about 130 people working night and day to get this fixed,” Mackenzie said. “We are continuing to mine so we will have good stocks at the mines as soon as the rail fully opens ... and we believe that with the recovery plan that we have, which is within a week, we will not be letting down any of our customers.” BHP was investigating the cause of the accident and was in “constructive discussions” with regulators about restarting its rail operations, he added. “We lost control of a train. We monitored what was going on through our remote control centre in Perth. We let it go through a number of points in the hope that it would slow down on its own,” he said. “As soon as it became a risk to bridges and trains in front, we derailed it ... we were able to do it in a controlled way and keep everyone safe.” Mackenzie also said BHP’s Olympic Dam copper operations in outback South Australia state were running again after a failure at an acid plant in August and remained a core part of its business. The miner said in August that Olympic Dam was the only part of the business not delivering “an acceptable return on capital,” raising speculation about a possible sale. However, Mackenzie said the development of the world’s fourth largest copper body into an underground mine would give better exposure to uranium, which some investors see as ripe for a recovery given plans by China and Japan to build new nuclear reactors. “If there is this renaissance in nuclear power you have phenomenal amounts of uranium ... I see that as very attractive,” he said."
7.5497132674779674, BHP secures exploration license for two oil blocks off eastern Canada (Reuters) - The world’s biggest miner BHP said on Thursday it secured a full participating interest in and operatorship of two exploration licences for oil assets in offshore Eastern Canada. BHP said in a statement the bid price of $625 million covers the drilling and seismic work required by the project over a six year term. It added that its initial planned capital expenditure on the exploration work programs for the oil blocks is $140 million up to fiscal 2021.
7.5497132674779674," BHP expects derailed train to impact its Australian iron ore exports MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Mining giant BHP Billiton expects some interruption to its Australian iron ore exports after a nearly 3-km-long train loaded with the commodity was forcibly derailed this week after running away en route to a key shipping hub. BHP said in a statement on Wednesday that its reserves of the steelmaking ingredient at the Port Hedland hub were not expected to cover the entire period of disruption following the incident, and that it would be liaising with its customers about its contractual commitments over that time. One of BHP’s customers in China, a steel producer, has, however, not yet received any notice from the miner. “We have a long-term contract with BHP and we haven’t received a notification so far,” said an official at the mill in southern China who declined to be named as he was not authorized to speak to media. BHP did not immediately respond to a Reuters query on whether it expects to declare a force majeure on shipments. Force majeure means a buyer or seller cannot fulfill contractual obligations because of outside forces. Analysts expect BHP to be able to claw back any shipment delays and the impact to operations to be insignificant. There has been no disruption so far to shipments of BHP’s medium-grade iron ore cargoes to top market China, traders said. Prices of iron ore futures in both China <0#DCIO:> and in Singapore <0#SZZF:> were lower on Wednesday. “I don’t think any disruption would matter as demand is now focused on low-grade iron ore,” said an iron ore trader in the city-state of Singapore. Australia’s Transport Safety Bureau said on Monday that a probe into the derailment was underway. It is expected to release a report in the second quarter of 2019. The derailment came after the train ran away at high speed for nearly 100 km (62 miles) when the driver left the cabin for an inspection. Nobody was injured in the incident that happened in a remote area around 120 km south of the world’s largest iron ore loading terminal in the country’s northwest. The miner said its normal train operations remain suspended, estimating that around 1.5 km of train track were damaged. BHP’s mine sites continue to operate and it expects a partial resumption of rail operations in about a week. “Investors are keeping one eye on the developments in the Pilbara after BHP announced it had halted all rail operations,” ANZ bank said in a report. Footage aired by a local television station showed a wrecked locomotive beside a chain of upturned wagons in the country’s Outback bushland. BHP expects the wreckage to be removed over the next few days with track repairs starting around the same time. “Recovery operations are underway. We cannot speculate on the outcome of the investigation,” BHP said. “However, we are working with the appropriate authorities and our focus remains on the safe recovery of our operations.”"

That would cause some uncertainty,” said James McGlew, executive director of corporate stockbroking at Argonaut. The Australian financial sector index rose after heavyweight Commonwealth Bank shares rose despite posting a decline in first-quarter cash profit. CBA noted that the outcome was 3 percent higher than average cash profits in the previous half, CBA said.

10.21485776693438," BHP suspends Western Australia rail operations after runaway train incident MELBOURNE (Reuters) - BHP Billiton said it had suspended all its iron ore rail operations in Western Australia on Monday after a train ran away at high speed for nearly 100 kilometers before being forcibly derailed. No one was injured and the train, loaded with iron ore, was traveling in a remote area. However, operations would be suspended while an investigation was underway, a spokeswoman for BHP, the world’s biggest miner, confirmed. The Australian newspaper had earlier reported that BHP had suspended rail operations in the region after the incident. The train, which was running on BHP’s private Mount Newman railway line, took off while the driver, the only person on the train, had temporarily stepped off the locomotive to an inspect an issue with a wagon. The train ran for 92 kilometers at around 100 kilometers an hour, Reuters calculations show. The accident is likely to raise safety concerns about miners’ plans to bring driverless trains to Australia’s iron ore heartland. Rival Rio Tinto made its first iron ore delivery by autonomous train in July. The Mount Newman railway line carries ore from Newman in Australia’s iron ore-rich Pilbara to Port Hedland across a remote 426 kilometers and is one of Australia’s longest private railways. Australia’s transport authority said it was investigating the incident. “A Western Australia iron ore train has been derailed near Turner River on route to Port Hedland this morning,” BHP said in a statement. “No one has been injured. We are working with the appropriate authorities to investigate the situation.” The damage to the train was “substantial”, The Australian Transport Safety Bureau said in a report. BHP said that the train began to move at 0440 am while the driver was out conducting an inspection, before the train was intentionally derailed after about 90 km at about 0530 am. “At approximately 0440 on 5 November 2018, the driver of a loaded ore train consisting of four locomotives and 268 wagons stopped at the 211 km point. The driver alighted from the locomotive to inspect an issue with a wagon,” BHP said in a statement. While the driver was outside of the locomotive, the train took off. “With no one on board, the train traveled for 92 km until ... the train was deliberately derailed at a set of points operated by the control center, about 119 km from Port Hedland,” the transport safety bureau said."

9.858582502863362," BHP to return $10.4 billion in buyback, special dividend bonanza (Reuters) - Top global miner BHP on Thursday said it would buy back shares and pay a special dividend to return $10.4 billion to shareholders, sticking to a promise to hand back all of the proceeds from the sale of its U.S. shale business. Investors cheered the massive return and the split between a $5.2 billion off-market buyback and a $5.2 billion special dividend, sending BHP’s Australian shares up as much as 6.2 percent. BHP had promised to return all of the net proceeds from the $10.8 billion sale of its U.S. shale business to shareholders when the deal was announced in July. British oil major BP Plc bought most of the U.S. business in a deal completed this week. “It’s good that 100 percent is going back to shareholders,” said Stephen Butel, an analyst with Platypus Asset Management, which owns shares in BHP. Miners have been handing money back to shareholders following a recovery from the commodity bust of 2015-16, under pressure from investors not to waste growing piles of cash on buying up assets that may never deliver returns. “Giving $10 billion back shows you they probably don’t see opportunities to deploy a huge amount of capital internally at the moment,” Butel said. “The whole industry’s probably learned from the previous boom and would be quite hesitant to go out and do a large acquisition.” Bidding into the off-market buyback will open on Nov. 19 and close on Dec 14. Investors are allowed to tender in shares at up to a 14 percent discount to the market price. Once the off-market buyback is completed, BHP will decide the per share amount for its special dividend. “Returning this $10.4 billion will bring the total cash returned to shareholders to $21 billion over the last two years,” BHP Chief Executive Officer Andrew Mackenzie said. Australian institutional investors were pleasantly surprised the buyback was for BHP’s Australia-listed shares rather than its UK-listed shares, said Paul Xiradis, Chief Executive of Ausbil Dexia, which owns BHP stock. The investors had thought the buyback would apply to the UK-listed shares, Xiradis said, as they typically trade at a discount because the UK shares do not have access to Australian dividend tax credits. As a result, investors piled into BHP’s Australian shares on Thursday to get access to the dividend tax credits that come with an off-market buyback, driving trade in the stock to its biggest volume in 2-1/2 years. “The after-tax return can actually be quite substantive,” Xiradis said. BHP’s big return to investors comes as world No.2 miner Rio Tinto is returning to shareholders $3.2 billion reaped from the sale of its Australian coal assets on top of a $4 billion share buyback. “We like both (BHP and Rio). We do have both and part of the reason is that they are generating a lot of cash,” Xiradis said, adding that the companies were continuing to invest in replenishing reserves of their key products. “So they’re managing their business quite effectively for value rather than for volume.”"

The S&P/ASX 200 index rose 0.2 percent or 11.6 points to 5,841.90 by 0035 GMT, on track to post a fifth consecutive session of gains. The benchmark, however, is coming off a 6.1 percent October loss, its biggest monthly drop since August 2015, hurt by Sino-U.S. trade tensions and corporate growth worries in the U.S. The world’s biggest miner BHP rose as much as 6.2 percent, its biggest intra-day gain in nearly two years, after it said it will start an off-market buyback of $5.2 billion shares immediately, with the remainder of the proceeds from its U.S. onshore assets sale to be returned in the form of a special dividend. BHP, an index heavyweight, spurred the bourse’s metals and mining index, up as much as 3.1 percent, to its biggest intra-day gain in more than six months. “The special dividend is very important for Australian investors because very likely there will be franking attached, making it more valuable,” said Michael McCarthy, chief strategist at CMC Markets Stockbroking. Australia’s largest-listed wealth manager AMP Ltd was the top percentage gainer on the benchmark, rising as much as 9.7 percent, after reports the country’s biggest investment bank Macquarie Group is mulling a takeover of the embattled firm, reeling under Royal Commission inquiry. The financial index erased initial losses to rise as much as about 1 percent in morning trade, with all “Big Four” banks trading higher despite National Bank of Australia , the country’s fourth-largest lender reporting, a 14 percent fall in annual earnings. “It (NAB results report) was not as bad as feared... So we are seeing a bit of a relief rally but the stock has already faded from the highs in early trading,” McCarthy said. The early gains in the benchmark, however, were capped by losses in the energy sector after oil prices fell overnight on evidence of rising global crude supply, but losses were limited by signs of strong U.S. demand for fuel. Australia’s top energy retailer Origin Energy fell as much as 1.5 percent while oil and gas explorer Beach Energy shed as much as 2.3 percent.

16.7386837845839," High oil prices hurt consumers, dent fuel demand: IEA chief SINGAPORE (Reuters) - High oil prices are hurting consumers and could also have adverse implications for producers, the executive director of the International Energy Agency (IEA) said on Tuesday. Major emerging Asian economies such as India and Indonesia have been hit hard this year by rising crude oil prices, which despite declining this month are still up by about 15 percent since the start of 2018. Fuel import costs have been pushed up further by a slide in emerging market currencies against the dollar, denting growth and even triggering protests and government fuel price controls in India. “Many countries’ current account deficits have been affected by high oil prices,” IEA chief Fatih Birol said at an energy conference in Singapore. “There are two downward pressures on global oil demand growth. One is high oil prices, and in many countries they’re directly related to consumer prices. The second one is global economic growth momentum slowing down.” The effect of high oil prices will be compounded in Southeast Asia as demand is rising fast but production is falling, resulting in the region becoming a net importer of oil, gas and coal, Birol said. Despite the possibility of a slowdown, Birol said the general outlook for fuel consumption was for continued growth. While the rise of electric vehicles is expected to result in peak demand for products like diesel and gasoline within coming years, a consumption boom in products such as plastic as well as fuel demand growth from aviation have triggered large-scale refinery investment into petrochemical products and high quality products like jet fuel. “Global oil demand will continue to grow even amid the rise of electric vehicles as they are governed by petrochemicals, aviation, among others,” he said. BHP Billiton, the world’s biggest miner, which has oil and gas assets but also hopes to benefit from the demand for raw materials coming from batteries for electric vehicles (EV), also said oil demand would still grow despite the rise of EVs. BHP’s Chief Commercial Officer, Arnoud Balhuizen, said on Tuesday during a conference in Melbourne that oil demand will increase by 1 percent a year on average over the next 10 to 15 years. “There will be substitution coming... on the back of an increased pickup of electric vehicles. But even if we plug in the most ambitious electric vehicle trends... in our forecasting, we continue to see oil demand on the back of other sectors,” he said. To meet the 1 percent per year consumption growth, Balhuizen said “quite a bit of new capital needs to be allocated to the oil industry in the next five to ten years to be able to meet that demand.” More so than oil, Birol said demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG) would boom. He said that global LNG trade could pass 500 billion cubic meters per day (bcm) by 2023, growing by a third in the coming five years. BHP’s Balhuizen echoed this in Melbourne, saying “LNG is a commodity with very strong demand outlook.” Birol said just three countries, Qatar, Australia and the United States, would supply 60 percent of global LNG by 2023. LNG demand is primarily driven by growth in China, where an anti-pollution program is driving a massive shift from coal to natural gas. But demand is also expected to grow fast in Southeast Asia, where Birol said the power sector needed $50 billion of investment by 2040, more than twice the current level, to keep up with consumption. Despite this growth potential, the LNG sector faces increasing competition from renewables and storage technology, which are cleaner than fossil fuels and becoming much cheaper. In many countries, Birol said solar power was on track to become the cheapest source of new electricity."
16.7386837845839," BHP trims forecasts for U.S., China GDP growth due to trade conflict MELBOURNE (Reuters) - The world’s biggest miner BHP Billiton has trimmed its expectations of global growth for next year and 2020 due to a “lose-lose” result from the U.S.-China trade conflict, a senior executive said on Tuesday. BHP’s modeling suggested the trade row would cut both Chinese and U.S. GDP growth by about a half to three quarters of a percentage point, Chief Commercial Officer Arnoud Balhuizen told the IMARC mining conference in Melbourne. “Which confirms that the trade protection will create a lose-lose outcome,” he said. BHP has “not yet seen any material impact on our business,” he added. China’s economy grew by a slower-than-expected 6.5 percent in the third quarter, its weakest pace since the global financial crisis, and analysts believe business conditions will get worse before they get better. Meanwhile, the United States is preparing to announce tariffs on all remaining Chinese imports by early December if talks next month between presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping fail to ease the trade war, Bloomberg reported on Monday, citing unnamed sources. “We have to be realistic that the current situation will not be solved easily,” Balhuizen said. However, despite rising trade tension hitting global growth, less trade between China and the United States would open the door to increased trade elsewhere. “There’s a lot of other countries around the Sino-U.S. trade protection scenario which are actively upping their trade,” he said."

4.420265887264549," BHP’s first quarter iron-ore output jumps 8 percent, cuts copper guidance (Reuters) - The world’s biggest miner, BHP, said on Wednesday its first-quarter iron ore production rose 8 percent on strong Chinese demand for high-grade ore, but cut its fiscal 2019 guidance for copper production, citing outages at key mines. BHP trimmed its 2019 copper production forecast by about 3 percent to a range of 1.62 million tonnes to 1.71 million tonnes, citing reduced production at its Spence and Olympic Dam mines in Chile and Australia, respectively. The Olympic Dam mine was closed for repairs and is expected to resume operations by the end of this month, while operations at Spence continue at partial capacity following a fire in September. Operations at Spence are expected to reach full capacity during December, the company said in a statement. The outages also hurt production during the quarter, with copper output flat at 409,000 tonnes. “We are on track to meet guidance for the 2019 financial year across our commodities, except copper where we have reduced production guidance slightly following outages at Olympic Dam in Australia and Spence in Chile,” Chief Executive Andrew Mackenzie said. BHP’s iron ore output rose to 69 million tonnes during the three months ended Sept. 30, compared with 64 million tonnes a year ago. That was in line with UBS’s estimate of 68.8 million tonnes. The Anglo-Australian miner maintained its fiscal 2019 guidance of 273 million to 283 million tonnes of iron ore. China’s iron ore imports this year have held remarkably steady, suggesting that demand by the world’s second-biggest economy has not been much affected by the trade dispute with the United States. China buys just over half of Australia’s commodity exports. Nickel production fell 8 percent after operations at the miner’s Kalgoorlie smelter in Australia were suspended following a fire in September.

1.8369696759012404," BHP doubles stake in promising Ecuador copper project MELBOURNE/LONDON (Reuters) - The world’s biggest miner BHP nearly doubled its stake in SolGold Plc on Tuesday, vying for position with top shareholder Newcrest Mining as it eyes SolGold’s promising Cascabel copper-gold project in Ecuador. Under the deal, BHP will pay SolGold 45 million pounds ($59 million) for 100 million new shares in the company at a 28 percent premium to the stock’s last close, taking its total spend on the developer to $85 million. The move drove SolGold’s London-listed shares almost 30 percent higher at one point. At 1100 GMT, the stock was up 17 percent, with BHP’s shares down 1.3 percent. BHP, which bought into SolGold just six weeks ago, has increased its holding to 11.2 percent, nearing the 14.5 percent stake held by Newcrest, Australia’s biggest listed gold miner. Under the latest deal, which analysts said was a big vote of confidence in the quality of SolGold’s assets, BHP has the right to appoint a director. For a two-year period, it agreed it cannot acquire a further stake in SolGold above a threshold of 246,634,271 shares, which would take it to around 13.5 percent, without SolGold consent. “This additional investment in SolGold strengthens our strategic position in the Cascabel copper exploration project,” BHP President Minerals Americas Danny Malchuk said in a statement. Newcrest declined to comment. SolGold’s CEO Nick Mather said in a statement BHP’s investment was welcome and would help the company take “an aggressive path to the development of this exciting project”. “The strong premium paid and the $59.2 million in funds raised means we can get on with the task of getting to feasibility,” he said. SolGold rejected an offer by BHP to take a 10 percent stake in the company in October 2016 for $30 million. At the time, BHP also offered to spend a further $275 million for up to 70 percent of Cascabel, an offer SolGold rejected because it did not want to lose control. In common with other miners that have recovered from the price crash of 2015-16, BHP is seeking to expand its copper portfolio. The highly conductive metal is in demand for use in renewable energy and electric vehicles, but new deposits are rare and increasingly difficult to recover. BHP says it prefers to build its own projects to maximize profitability, rather than to expand through acquisitions, but buying a small stake in an early-stage project gives it a chance to influence development. Analyst Paul Gait of Bernstein said the Cascabel project would suit BHP’s business model perfectly. “It’s a copper porphyry (a large formation where copper can be accompanied by gold) suited to bulk mining in a safe-ish location,” he said. While BHP has deeper pockets, Newcrest has technical skills, known as block-caving, linked to large-scale bulk underground mining. Block-caving involves hollowing out an ore body and allowing it to collapse under its own weight. It has a smaller environmental footprint than open pit mining. Newcrest is one of a handful of miners that has block-cave experience."

Henry said Olympic Dam, which contains uranium oxide, copper, gold and silver, was “a wonderful ore body”, but in the latest in a series of setbacks, BHP in August announced it had shut an acid plant following a boiler tube failure, disrupting copper processing. Underground mining at the site continued as normal. The company’s CEO said at the time Olympic Dam was the only part of the business not delivering “an acceptable return on capital”. In Brazil meanwhile, it is still too soon to say when BHP’s Samarco iron ore operations, a joint venture with Vale , will resume output following a dam burst in late 2015. Brazil says this was its worst environmental disaster. “We’re not on the cusp of a restart let’s put it that way,” Henry said and listed everything that needed to happen first, including winning community support, securing permits, ironing out technical details, proving the asset is “financially attractive” and restructuring its debt. BHP is also still resolving legal issues in Brazil. It has signed a deal with Brazilian authorities that resolves a 20 billion reais ($5.30 billion) lawsuit, but separately it has two years to reach a settlement over a 155 billion reais lawsuit. The company also remains under pressure from activist investor Elliott Advisors, which has called for BHP to collapse its dual British-Australian structure. Unilever executives last week scrapped plans to move the company headquarters from London to the Netherlands in the face of a shareholder revolt. BHP’s Henry said BHP had never ruled out collapsing its dual structure and would continue to look at the possibility, but it had yet to be convinced it could be cost effective. “One thing we would take away from the Unilever decision is making sure we’re soliciting views from the full group of shareholders,” Henry said. Elliott Advisors had no comment on Tuesday. (Reporting by Barbara Lewis. Editing by Jane Merriman)"
-1.579669127260999," BHP sees major copper demand boost from China's widening belt and road LONDON (Reuters) - China’s overseas expansion will spread over land that is home to more than half the world’s population, potentially boosting copper use by 1.6 million tonnes, or roughly 7 percent of annual demand, major miner BHP said on Thursday. BHP has analysed the impact of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a network of overseas construction projects, on commodity demand on the basis of a database it constantly updates. It said China’s overseas expansion plan covered 115 partners across Eurasia, parts of Africa, Latin American and Oceania, up from 68 countries or regions it cited in a previous blog post in September last year. Its latest analysis estimated the BRI represented one third of the global economy and would drive spending of up to $1.3 trillion over the decade to 2023. Vicky Binns, BHP’s vice president for minerals marketing, told Reuters if anything the expectation an extra 1.6 million tonnes of refined copper would be needed over the same time period was conservative. More than 70 percent of that demand is from 100 power projects, which typically are not the biggest source of copper consumption - accounting for between 13 and 22 percent of all copper use depending on the region. Such initial investment could lead to knock-on demand from other sectors. “Increasing the international competitiveness of manufacturing in these regions may create a major lift in future demand from copper intensive sectors, such as automobiles, consumer durables and machinery,” BHP says. Binns downplayed the impact of mounting trade tensions between the United States and China on demand, saying long-term fundamentals were likely to be robust. China is expected to be a major beneficiary of increased demand because of its massive copper smelting capacity, but Binns said BHP was also well-placed because it can develop its own capacity and work with junior players. The major has said the commodities in which it seeks to expand are copper and oil and in September it bought a 6.1 percent stake in SolGold to get access to a promising copper-gold project in Ecuador. [nL3N1VQ5P6] BHP, which operates the world’s largest copper mine Escondida in Chile, said in its 2018 report it derived 28 percent of its underlying earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization from copper. Its ranking varies from year to year, but said the latest figures make it the third largest copper company behind Chile’s Codelco and U.S.-based Freeport McMoRan."
-7.368214136924559," Vale, BHP reach final deal with prosecutors over Brazil disaster SAO PAULO/RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian prosecutors in Minas Gerais state said on Tuesday they reached a final compensation deal with mining companies Samarco, Vale VALE3.SA and BHP Billiton BHP.AX regarding a 2015 dam burst, Brazil's largest ever environmental disaster. According to a statement from prosecutors released late on Tuesday, the deal allows for compensation payments to start to relatives of the 19 people killed in the disaster, as well as to people who lost their houses and other properties. No financial details of the deal were disclosed in the short statement on Tuesday, but the chief prosecutor in the city of Mariana will hold a press conference on Wednesday to discuss the agreement. Brazil’s worst environmental catastrophe happened when a dam designed to hold back mine waste from the Samarco iron pellets operation in Mariana burst, leaving a trail of destruction for hundreds of kilometers in Minas Gerais and Espírito Santo states. Another deal had been reached by the mining companies and prosecutors in regions hit by the disaster away from Mariana, where victims found that offer insufficient. With this last settlement, companies might be able to prepare to resume operations in the region more than two years after the accident. Vale has said it expects the Samarco unit to resume operations in 2018 or early next year, but has pushed back forecasts several times. The mine still needs permits to reopen, and the lack of a clear timeline makes it harder for the controlling companies to renegotiate the debt Samarco will carry from the disaster."

-3.1075230535043086," BHP seeks approval for $50 million U.S. pact over fatal Brazil dam burst NEW YORK (Reuters) - BHP Billiton Ltd has asked a U.S. judge to approve a $50 million settlement of claims that it fraudulently inflated its share price by overstating its ability to manage safety risks before a fatal 2015 dam burst at a Brazilian mine. The Anglo-Australian mining company’s preliminary settlement of class-action litigation led by two Alabama pension plans was filed on Wednesday night with the U.S. District Court in Manhattan. It would resolve shareholder claims stemming from the Nov. 5, 2015 bursting of the Fundão dam in Minas Gerais, Brazil’s main mining state, at a mine run by Samarco, a joint venture between BHP and Brazil’s Vale SA. The disaster unleashed huge quantities of mud and waste that destroyed a nearby village and killed 19 people. BHP denied wrongdoing in settling with investors in its American depositary receipts led by the City of Birmingham Retirement and Relief System and the City of Birmingham Firemen’s and Policemen’s Supplemental Pension System. It is unclear how much of the payout is covered by insurance. BHP did not immediately respond on Thursday to a request for comment. The settlement covered ADR investors from Sept. 25, 2014, when BHP touted its focus on safety in a regulatory filing, and Nov. 30, 2015, when Brazil sued BHP and Vale for 20 billion reais (US4.87 billion). That case settled in June. In a court filing, the plaintiffs’ lawyers led by Robbins Geller Rudman & Dowd said they may seek up to $15 million from the settlement fund to cover legal fees. The case is In re BHP Billiton Ltd Securities Litigation, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 16-01445."
2.6629129044383877," BHP chief sees pay rise trimmed on production, fatalities MELBOURNE (Reuters) - BHP Billiton Chief Executive Andrew Mackenzie received a $100,000 pay rise in the last financial year but missed out on a higher increase after two fatalities and lower than targeted output of key commodities, BHP said on Tuesday. The increase bumped up Mackenzie’s pay to $4.66 million from $4.55 million a year earlier. Target remuneration stood at $7.72 million with a maximum of $13.1 million the in the case of “significant outperformance”, BHP said in its annual report. For the coming year, Mackenzie’s base salary will remain at $1.7 million, where it has been frozen since he was appointed to the top job in 2013. The rest of his remuneration is based on meeting a mix of short and long term incentive targets. The pay increase took into account two fatalities: at the Goonyella Riverside coking coal mine in the Australian state of Queensland in August 2017, and at the Permian Basin Shale operations in West Texas in November last year, BHP said in the report. It also reflected overall volumes of coal, iron ore and copper that fell short of the miner’s “stretch” targets. BHP said its remuneration committee considered Mackenzie’s “strong performance” against individual objectives, including the divestment of the company’s onshore shale assets, and board approvals for the Spence copper and South Flank iron ore expansions in Chile and Australia respectively. BHP posted record iron ore output for fiscal 2018 as greater productivity lifted production by 3 percent, in line or beating analyst forecasts. Full-year production came in at 275 million tonnes, at the lower end of BHP’s 273-283 million tonnes target. In line with the approach for Mackenzie, the base salaries and total target remuneration packages for all other executive key management personnel will also be held constant for this financial year, BHP said.

-1.557700217353517," BHP buys into Ecuador copper project with $35 million SolGold stake (Reuters) - Global miner BHP BHP.AX has struck a deal to pay $35 million for a 6.1 percent stake in SolGold SOLG.L, giving it a share in the promising Cascabel copper-gold project in Ecuador after an earlier attempt failed. SolGold's share price leapt around 17 percent as the market took BHP's acquisition as a vote of confidence in the project, while BHP shares BLT.L slipped one percent by 1330 GMT. BHP’s Chief Executive Andrew Mackenzie said the investment provided exposure to a high quality copper exploration project in Ecuador, a “highly prospective” location. In common with other miners that have recovered from the price crash of 2015-16, BHP is seeking to grow its asset base and is keen on copper. The metal is expected to be in demand for use in renewable energy and electric vehicles, but new opportunities are scarce. The deal sets the stage for a potential showdown with Australian gold miner Newcrest Mining Ltd NCM.AX, the top shareholder in SolGold, Cascabel's majority owner and operator, with a 14.54 percent stake. “It’s a pretty attractive asset. It’s early stage but the geology looks prospective,” said a Melbourne-based analyst for a fund manager, who declined to be named due to company policy. “This basically means that Newcrest isn’t going to have it all to themselves. I think if I was Newcrest or SolGold management, I would be a bit nervous about BHP being in there.” Any stake of more than 5 percent gives a shareholder the right to requisition a general meeting and circulate a resolution under English company law. SolGold rejected an offer by BHP to take a 10 percent stake in the firm in October, 2016, for $30 million. At the time, it also offered to spend a further $275 million for up to 70 percent of Cascabel, an offer the company rejected because it did not want to lose control. Wednesday's 27.4 million pound ($35.5 million) deal to buy Guyana Goldfields' GUY.TO 6.1 percent stake is pitched at a 20 percent premium to the 20-day average share price. Guyana Goldfields opened unchanged in Toronto. SolGold may have a closer affinity with Newcrest than BHP, given the major deposit is a copper gold porphyry system that could be best mined by using a block cave method, analysts said. Block caving involves hollowing out an ore body and allowing it to collapse under its own weight. It has a smaller environmental footprint than open pit mining. Newcrest is one of a handful of miners that has block cave experience, at its Cadia gold mine in Australia’s state of New South Wales. Rio Tinto RIO.LRIO.AX also has experience of block caving at its Oyu Tolgoi copper mine in Mongolia. ($1 = 0.7714 pounds)"

-7.484815268042411," Total rules out investing in U.S. shale oil after BP-BHP deal STAVANGER, Norway (Reuters) - French energy group Total TOTF.PA is not looking at investing in the U.S. shale oil industry, the company's chief executive said on Monday. Patrick Pouyanne made the comment when asked whether peer BP's BP.L $10.5 billion acquisition of U.S. shale assets from BHP Billiton BLT.LBHP.AX had made the sector more attractive. “It’s first quite expensive, second we don’t have the human resources. BP had the human resources, BP had already a position, so I can understand their move but it’s not my case,” Pouyanne said on the sidelines of an oil conference. BP’s acquisition of about 500,000 producing acres marked a turning point for the group since the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, for which the company is still paying off more than $65 billion in penalties and clean-up costs. Shell RDSa.L and Norway's Equinor EQNR.OL have also invested in U.S. shale, but Eni ENI.MI and Total have been cautious. U.S. shale veteran and Pioneer Natural Resources PXD.N Chairman Scott Sheffield rang an optimistic note when asked at the conference about European oil and gas companies investing in U.S. shale. “Eventually I think more and more majors will get there, (because) it’s the fastest-growing region for the next 10 years in the world. And so if you’re not in the Permian ... then you’d better find growth somewhere else,” Sheffield said. He was referring to the Permian basin, which stretches across western Texas and eastern New Mexico."
1.0097512829757513," BHP warns protectionism will stoke U.S. costs LONDON (Reuters) - Protectionism will result in higher prices for U.S. citizens, a senior executive at BHP BLT.LBHP.AX said on Tuesday, adding that the mining company was already seeing the effect. The world’s biggest listed mining company reported higher profits on Tuesday and said its business could weather market volatility linked to trade tensions between the United States and China. However, Arnoud Balhuizen, head of marketing and supply, who oversees procurement as well as sales, said protectionism was likely to add to inflationary pressures. “All economically rational people know that protectionism will not be good for the U.S. population. It will increase prices in the U.S. and we are seeing that in the onshore U.S. (oil and gas) for example,” he told Reuters in an interview. “Steel pipes in the U.S. are the most expensive worldwide.” In its economic and commodity outlook, BHP said the impact of higher steel tariffs in the United States was uncertain, but it was clear end–users in the United States were paying more for their steel than those in other regions. Hot–rolled coil steel, used in construction has reached $1,000 per tonne in the United States compared with prices “in the mid $600s and the mid $500s” in northern Europe and China respectively, it said in its outlook."
1.0097512829757513," Brazil's Samarco mine unlikely to restart in 2019: BHP SAO PAULO (Reuters) - There is little likelihood that Brazil’s Samarco iron ore mine, a joint venture between Vale SA and BHP Billiton, will restart operations next year even though it expects to have all of the required licenses, a BHP spokesman said on Tuesday. The statement confirmed comments made by another BHP official, Bryan Quinn, in an interview with newspaper Valor Economico. Quinn, an executive in charge of the company’s mineral joint ventures, told Reuters in a separate interview that restarting operations at the disaster-struck mine depends on an agreement with prosecutors on building a new tailing dam system. Mining operations have stalled since 2015 when an existing dam burst, releasing a torrent of toxic mud that killed 19 people and left a trail of destruction for hundreds of kilometers. Quinn said that despite receiving an environmental license eight months ago to build the tailing system, the company also needs to make a deal with federal prosecutors in Minas Gerais state to proceed. “We are working very hard for a restart,” he said. Quinn did not give details on what terms are being negotiated or a reason for why building the tailing system hinged on the deal. The prosecutor’s office in Minas Gerais declined to comment, saying the negotiations were confidential. Samarco Mineracao SA, the joint venture company, said earlier this month it expects by next year to have all the licenses it needs to resume operations. A spokeswoman for Samarco on Tuesday said that its announcement about the licenses did not indicate when operations at the mine would restart and there is currently no timeline for taking that step. Vale said the companies were working to resume operations as soon as possible even if there is no target date. The companies have previously said production would resume gradually and at a reduced capacity. Samarco had total capacity of 30.5 million tonnes of iron ore pellets per year before operations were suspended. Quinn separately told Valor that negotiating the restructuring of Samarco’s debt is the first step to guarantee the mine’s restart. Such talks have yet to take place, he said, and would be aimed at extending maturities and convincing creditors that the business is sustainable, according to Valor."
1.0097512829757513," Rising costs, trade worries tarnish BHP profit jump, record dividend MELBOURNE/LONDON (Reuters) - Concerns about rising costs and the impact of trade tensions between the United States and China weighed on shares of leading miner BHP on Tuesday after a 33 percent jump in annual underlying profit still missed forecasts. But the miner paid a record final dividend and said it expected to hand more money to shareholders on completion of a sale of U.S. shale assets to oil major BP. Other miners, which have recovered from the commodity price crash of 2015-16, have also been returning money to shareholders, under pressure not to repeat the reckless purchases of the commodity boom, and because of the difficulty of finding suitable opportunities for growth. Many miners are at the same time struggling to make themselves an attractive prospect to investors concerned about sustainability and climate change. In 2017, BHP came under pressure for change from activist investor Elliott Advisors, which listed a series of demands to raise shareholder returns, including selling unprofitable shale assets. Elliott on Tuesday declined to comment. BHP said it planned to meet the investor this week. BHP, which has said it was seeking reform of its own accord, in July announced BP would buy U.S. shale oil and gas assets from it for $10.5 billion. The miner said it would decide how to return profits from the sale to investors once the deal was finalised. Portfolio manager Andy Forster of Argo Investments in Melbourne said the dividend was stronger than he had expected, but the cut in productivity gains forecast in the 2019 fiscal year - to $1 billion from a previously promised $2 billion - “slightly took the gloss off the results”. Alasdair McKinnon, fund manager of the Scottish Investment Trust, which is a shareholder in BHP, said the results were solid. “Miners like BHP have climbed remarkably from the dark hole they found themselves in just a couple of years ago,” he said in an emailed comment. BHP’s share price in London fell more than 2 percent by 1432 GMT, while the broader mining index was down nearly 1 percent. BHP shares compared to rival miners: reut.rs/2OUh3S9 ‘A LITTLE MORE APPREHENSIVE’ BHP Chief Executive Andrew Mackenzie said the company was “a little more apprehensive” on the short-term outlook, given trade relations between China and the United States. Escalating tensions between China, the biggest commodity consumer, and the U.S. have rattled metals markets and raised the prospect of reduced Chinese demand. Copper prices on the London Metal Exchange have fallen around 18 percent from a four-year high touched on June 7. Arnoud Balhuizen, BHP president of marketing and supply, told Reuters in an interview the copper market arguably had been more driven by sentiment than by any direct trade impact and he had seen no difference in customer demand. For the year ended June 30, underlying profit, which excludes one-time gains and losses, rose to $8.93 billion from $6.73 billion, supported by higher output and higher prices, just below an estimate of $9.27 billion according to 15 analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. BHP paid a record final dividend of $0.63 a share, up from $0.43 a year ago, on the back of free cashflow of $12.5 billion. Including one-off charges, BHP’s profit fell 37 percent to $3.71 billion. BHP on Tuesday announced a $650 million charge for a failure at the Samarco dam, operated jointly by BHP and Vale. The dam collapse in 2015 killed 19 people in Brazil’s worst environmental disaster. BHP also announced a $2.8 billion post-tax charge from the sale of the U.S. shale oil and gas assets."

The outage followed the failure of several boiler tubes at the acid plant, it said without offering an expected timeline for operations to resume. “Remediation and mitigation activities are underway, and underground mining operations continue as normal,” it said in its full-year earnings release. Olympic Dam’s copper production was expected to increase to between 200,000 tonnes and 220,000 tonnes in the 2019 financial year, reflecting improved operational stability and higher ore grades from the Southern Mine Area, BHP said in its operational report on July 18. The mine produced some produced 137,000 tonnes of copper last financial year due to major planned smelter maintenance. Olympic Dam was now the “only part of our business which is not delivering an acceptable return on capital,” Chief Executive Andrew Mackenzie said in a results briefing on Tuesday. “I accept that we have a lot to do to continue to build confidence in Olympic dam... We have seen considerable improvement in our development rates... in the southern mine area and that has put our growth plans back on track.”"
1.0097512829757513," Breakingviews - Copper-bottomed BHP can now dig into bigger issues SINGAPORE (Reuters Breakingviews) - A copper-bottomed BHP can now dig into some tougher matters. The mining titan has reorganised its portfolio and, as full year results unveiled on Tuesday show, repaired its balance sheet. Cash flows are near record levels last seen seven years ago. That means the board and boss Andrew Mackenzie can turn their attention to pricklier strategic issues including whether to stick with oil, gas and potash. It has been a rocky ride for the $125 billion company. Business-cycle booms and busts are partly to blame, but bad decisions are, too. Moving into shale energy at the height of the fracking boom was one. Much of this has been resolved. Most recently, BHP agreed to sell the bulk of its U.S. onshore assets to BP. Debt has more than halved in two years to $10.9 billion, at the bottom end of BHP’s target range. Cost cuts and other improvements lifted EBITDA margins for the year to June 30 to 2011 levels, when mineral prices were substantially higher. BHP also has followed rivals in handing back more cash. The Australian company booked a record final dividend and confirmed it would return proceeds of its U.S. shale sale. That should help support a healthy valuation of 15 times expected earnings. A tidier house and cooler metal prices will prompt fresh questions, though. The first is whether BHP should remain in conventional oil, the smallest and least profitable of its main areas of operation. Exploration successes have been encouraging, but hints that BHP might consider a deal revive concerns over whether the business is an expensive diversion. The second, thornier, problem is what to do with two giant greenfield assets: Olympic Dam, an Australian mine that has suffered consistent production troubles, and Jansen, a potash initiative whose future is undecided. BHP has a poor track record in such complex projects built from scratch. Bringing in a partner for both would ease some pressure. That will be easier said than done, especially for Jansen, given the consolidated nature of the industry. Healthy returns of capital should keep BHP investors appeased for now. It won’t be long, though, before they get restless again."

BHP’s full-year underlying profit rose 32.7 percent but fell short of expectations with shares losing 1.8 percent as investors shrugged off a record final dividend. The S&P/ASX 200 index was down 0.9 percent to 6,289.80 at 0200 GMT on Tuesday. It added 0.1 percent on Monday. “Now we’re getting into desynchronised global growth - some parts doing well, some not so well...BHP is pretty much linked to what happens in China,” said Mathan Somasundaram, Chief market strategist at CMC Markets. “We’re looking at a situation where the U.S. is potentially going to do okay, China’s probably going to do less okay - which means it’s going to get tougher than what it has been in the last couple of years.” BHP’s chief executive on Tuesday said the miner was “a little more apprehensive” on the short-term outlook given the trade ructions between China and the United States. Shares of rival miner Rio Tinto Ltd were 0.9 percent lower. Seven West Media Ltd lost as much as 11.3 percent after the firm said its full-year underlying net profit fell 14.6 percent. An index of the country’s financial stocks was trading 0.9 percent lower, with Commonwealth Bank of Australia down 0.3 percent and Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd 1.6 percent lower. CMC Markets’ Somasundaram said that as trade war worries fade and emerging market currencies stabilise, money parked in Australian banks was being redeployed as the relative safety trade was unwound. Australia’s energy index was trading 1.4 percent lower despite oil prices holding ground as Oil Search Ltd reported a near 40 percent fall in half-year profit, counting the cost of an earthquake at a co-owned liquefied natural gas project during the period. Despite an upgrade to 2018 output guidance, Oil Search shares were down as much as 2.3 percent after the firm halved its interim dividend. Shares of Australia’s biggest grocer Woolworths Group fell 2.5 percent, extending losses incurred on Monday after it flagged it had rapidly lost sales momentum after starting to charge shoppers for plastic bags. In neighbouring New Zealand, the local benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index slipped 0.2 percent to 9,095.44, as losses in materials and telecom stocks weighed. Construction firm Fletcher Building Ltd dropped 3 percent as the main index retreated from an all-time high set on Monday. Fletcher is expected to report an annual loss on Wednesday compared with a profit last year as cost overruns at its commercial business unit continue to weigh.

-2.149421458060689," Nutrien steers potash recovery as BHP waits in the wings WINNIPEG, Manitoba/LONDON (Reuters) - Canada’s Nutrien Ltd, the world’s biggest potash miner by capacity, has helped engineer a surprising price rebound for the fertilizer by idling capacity. Now the trick will be keeping prices from appreciating too much to ensure a major would-be competitor, BHP Billiton Plc, stays on the sidelines. BHP has been weighing an entry into potash since prices spiked a decade ago. Construction of its Jansen mine in Saskatchewan – which could become the world’s largest - has been advancing slowly for years, but BHP has held off on committing the capital needed for completion, because of soft prices. A BHP entry would create stiff competition in Canada, where a marketing arrangement allows Nutrien and Mosaic Co to dominate. Fresh supply would also threaten a recovery for potash driven by steadily growing global demand, Nutrien’s curtailments and a slow ramp-up at new mines owned by K+S AG and EuroChem. Nutrien plans to wield its 8.1 million tonnes of unused capacity to protect its position, in a switch from its previous strategy of using curtailments to lift prices even at the cost of market share. Chief Executive Chuck Magro, asked whether Nutrien intends to balance its desire for higher prices with an effort to keep competitors out, said “that’s exactly the way we think about it.” Nutrien’s idled production represents 11 percent of current global operational capacity and will be deployed once prices approach levels that would encourage new mines, he said. “There will be a price in the global market, that once we get there, you will see Nutrien put more tonnes into the market because the demand is there. We will not be shy,” Magro told Reuters. Prices are well below such a level, he said, declining to identify it. Granular potash sells for an average $331 per tonne in Brazil, as of Aug. 17, up 25 percent year over year, according to Mosaic data. BHP likely needs prices in Brazil of around $400 per tonne to realize a reasonable return on the Jansen mine, said Bernstein analyst Jonas Oxgaard. Nutrien will need to keep prices below that level to avoid “waving a red flag in front of the BHP bull,” he said. BHP reports annual results on Tuesday, and investors will look for any improved sentiment toward potash, given rising prices. A spokeswoman said BHP takes a long-term view of commodities and investment decisions are not based on short-term prices. BHP has approved $3.9 billion in spending on the Jansen mine, allowing it to sink mine shafts. That work may last up to two years, and building the first 4 million-tonne stage of the mine is expected to require a further $4.7 billion that BHP’s board may consider next year. Three more stages of equal size are longer-term options, taking the mine to 16 million tonnes, or more than double the world’s current largest potash mine. Nutrien maximizes its leverage through Canpotex, a company it owns with Mosaic that handles transportation and sales outside North America. Canpotex’s ownership of thousands of rail cars and access to four port terminals give it a logistical advantage, raising the challenge for K+S, the only other Canadian potash miner, to compete. But BHP, one of the biggest global sellers of iron ore, copper and coal, has a global supply chain, low-cost production and a reputation for focusing on market share over price, positioning it to mount the fiercest competition Canpotex has ever seen in its own backyard. “It’s already a highly competitive space,” said Canpotex CEO Ken Seitz. “The fact that (BHP) would be coming out of Saskatchewan, I don’t see that as threatening Canpotex.” Canpotex expects to set a sales record this year of around 13 million tonnes, and has sold out of supplies through October. Demand from Brazil and China continues to grow, pushing global sales to an expected 66 million-67 million tonnes this year, Seitz said. Graphic on global potash supply and demand: tmsnrt.rs/2MLoQRl"

-3.4214862852795327," BHP, union extend labor talks at mammoth Chile copper mine (Reuters) - The union at the world’s largest copper mine, Escondida in Chile, has called off a strike planned to start on Tuesday after agreeing to extend talks with operator BHP for another day. The announcement early on Tuesday comes amid fears of a repeat of last year’s strike at Escondida, which jolted markets and dampened economic growth in Chile as it dragged on for 44 days. The extension follows five days of closely-watched talks over pay at the mine that have been mediated by the government of Chilean President Sebastian Pinera. “We’ve managed to clear up the points that had stalled the negotiation. But there are still some important points to be resolved,” the union said in a short statement, without giving further detail. Anglo-Australian mining giant BHP also said in a statement that it had agreed to extend talks with the union through Tuesday. In its last known offer more than two weeks ago, BHP offered a signing bonus of about $18,000, plus separate bonuses intended to buy out clauses in a previous contract that allowed for housing benefits and a loan program. The total package was valued at $27,700, including a salary increase of 1.5 percent. But the union had asked for a signing bonus almost double that offered by the company, and had requested a salary increase of 5 percent, leaving a wide gap between the two sides. The union said it would have to take any potential deal on Tuesday back to its members for approval. Escondida produced 925,400 tonnes of copper last year. On Monday, the union at Chile’s Caserones copper mine said it was also postponing a strike over a new labor contract in order to continue government-mediated talks with management through Thursday."
-3.3637841894192326," BHP says Brazil court approves Samarco settlement (Reuters) - Mining heavyweight BHP said on Thursday a federal court in the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais approved an agreement between miner Samarco and Brazil authorities, marking a milestone in the legal battle over a deadly 2015 dam failure. A 20 billion reais ($5.3 billion) lawsuit against Samarco, which is a joint venture of BHP and Vale SA, was quashed by the accord, which was signed in June. An even more expansive lawsuit was also suspended under the agreement. The company said it had separately agreed to pay $50 million as part of a settlement for a class-action complaint filed by American depositary receipt (ADR) holders over the disaster. Bryan Quinn, BHP’s head of non-operated joint ventures, said in an interview in Sao Paulo that the deal “creates a more stable legal and institutional environment for ongoing work and negotiations.” “There is still a lot of work to do and a long way to go on many fronts,” he added. “We now have even more stakeholders involved than in the past, which is positive, but it also means that activity doesn’t always move as quickly as we would like.” Samarco told Reuters in a statement on Tuesday that next year it expects to obtain licenses needed to resume operations. Operations have been paralyzed for nearly three years since a dam holding back waste at the mine burst, killing 19 people and leaving a trail of destruction for hundreds of kilometers. BHP still faces a class action in Australia over the dam’s failure."
-0.5479878233679537," Chilean union calls on BHP to change strategy in Escondida mine talks SANTIAGO (Reuters) - The union at Chile’s Escondida copper mine, the world’s largest, said on Tuesday that BHP must alter its negotiating strategy and improve its contract offer during a final phase of talks if it hoped to avoid a strike. The two sides set the agenda for the last round of talks on Tuesday after the company on Monday requested government-led mediation just hours before unionized workers had threatened to walk off the job. “They (BHP) still haven’t changed their strategy, they think that with a bonus they can buy out our (contract) benefits,” Carlos Allendes, a union spokesman, told Reuters on Tuesday before beginning talks in the northern coastal city of Antofagasta, near the mine. BHP’s final contract offer two weeks ago included a signing bonus of about $18,000, plus separate bonuses intended to buy out clauses in a previous contract that allowed for housing benefits and a loan program. The total package was valued at $27,700, including a salary increase of 1.5 percent. But the union had asked for a signing bonus of almost double that offered by the company, and had requested a salary increase of 5 percent, leaving a wide gap between the two sides. BHP declined to comment on the first day of the government-led talks, which are slated to continue until Aug. 13. A strike would begin on Aug. 14 if there is no agreement, though the talks could be extended by another five days if both sides agree. “They need to change their outlook. [For us] it’s not a question of money right now. It’s a question of long-term benefits,” Allendes said in a phone interview. Chile’s Mining Minister Baldo Prokurica on Tuesday called the company’s decision to opt for government mediation “good news” and urged the parties to reach agreement for the “good of the country.” Last year, a 44-day strike at the mine jolted global copper markets and slowed economic growth in the South American country, which is the world’s top copper producer. Copper prices rose slightly on Tuesday on hopes that China would boost spending on public works projects after several days of losses amid a mounting trade dispute between the United States and its trading partners. Escondida produced 925,000 tonnes of copper in 2017."
-0.5479878233679537," BHP boosts nickel mining, exploration investment amid electric vehicle boom KALGOORLIE, Australia (Reuters) - Global miner BHP is plowing more investment into nickel mine development and exploration in Western Australia, seeking to secure its own supply of a key material in batteries needed to meet booming demand for electric cars. BHP is building what is expected to be the world’s largest battery-grade nickel sulphate plant on the outskirts of Perth and is boosting output to be “as self-sufficient as possible”, asset president Eduard Haegel, told Reuters on the sidelines of the Diggers and Dealers mining conference in Kalgoorlie. Nickel is in increasingly hot demand in new battery technologies that mean cars can travel further on a single charge. Using more nickel also cuts costs by reducing the amount of expensive cobalt, a mainstay of current electric vehicle (EV) battery technology. Popular nickel, manganese and cobalt (NMC) lithium-ion batteries typically employ a ratio of 60 percent nickel to 20 percent cobalt and 20 percent manganese or 6:2:2. Increasingly battery makers are preparing to change the composition of these cathode materials to 80 percent nickel, 10 percent cobalt and 10 percent manganese. As well as sourcing from its own mines, BHP also buys nickel concentrate from other miners. The move to secure more of its own supply comes as anticipated EV demand encourages other miners to go into sulphate production themselves. Perth-based Independence Group, which supplies some of BHP’s needs, has said it will assess whether to build its own nickel sulphate plant by early next year before deciding whether to renew its supply deal with BHP, set to expire at the end of 2019. BHP’s Perth nickel sulphate plant is expected to come on line from April 2019 with capacity to produce 100,000 tonnes of nickel sulphate, accounting for some 22,000 tonnes of nickel. The miner is making plans to double capacity with a potential second-stage expansion. “I believe that we have timed our entry to the battery and nickel sulphate markets well – interest by customers and potential customers is significantly exceeding expectations,” Haegel told conference delegates during a speech. “Today, based on forward orders and indications, we now expect to achieve the 90 percent (sales) target...by the end of next calendar year, 2019.” BHP expects to ramp up to full capacity of 100,000 tonnes over several years. For now, BHP is developing a resources base at its Leinster mine and has internal approval to develop its Venus deposit with plans to expand the Mount Keith and Leinster concentrators in the West Australian state. BHP is also going ahead with a trial of cobalt sulphate production at a pilot plant with a view to eventually produce a battery-grade nickel sulphate product with low cobalt sulphate content, Haegel said. Analysts have speculated that the EV boom may encourage BHP to remove the “for sale” tag it put on its nickel division years ago. Haegel told Reuters that BHP’s nickel business remains non-core, but that it has not been and is still not in any sales process."

Workers last week voted to reject the company’s final wage offer and approved a strike, but either party can call for a 5-day period of government mediation by end of day Monday to forestall the walk-off. Union leaders told members in the memo that it had asked the company to state its position on several key aspects of the contract offer by 10:00 a.m. local time (1400 GMT) on Monday, after which workers would decide whether or not to call for government mediation. “The company proposed that mediation ... be solicited by both parties, to which the union replied that would depend on a positive response to the points we have raised,” the union said in the communication. BHP did not immediately respond to request for comment on Monday. Barring further negotiation between the company and the union, a strike could begin as early as Tuesday. Last year, a 44-day walk-off at the mine jolted global copper markets and docked economic growth in the South American country, which is the world’s top copper producer.

Union workers announced earlier on Thursday that they had voted to reject the company’s final wage offer, issued by the Anglo-Australian miner last week, and had approved a strike. Last year, a 44-day walk-off at the mine jolted global copper markets and docked economic growth in the South American country, which is the world’s top copper producer. Chilean labor law allows either party to call for a five-day period of government mediation that can be extended an additional five days ahead of a potential strike. “The union has taken the decision not to ask for the mediation ... however, we are willing to talk with the company beginning today in order to gauge whether there exists a real willingness to negotiate,” union head Patricio Tapia told reporters. “If we don’t see a change in attitude on the part of the company by Monday, August 6, we will conclude that it doesn’t make sense to extend the talks,” Tapia added. BHP said in a statement that the rejected wage offer was the “best collective labor contract at a private mine in the country.” It said it had begun to review contingency plans ahead of a possible strike. Chile’s government asked both sides to negotiate. “I call on them to talk and come together because otherwise this will definitively harm our country,” Finance Minister Felipe Larrain told reporters. BHP’s final offer was rejected by 84 percent of union workers, an outcome that was widely expected following a partial count of votes earlier this week. The deal offered by BHP included an approximately $18,000 signing bonus, and a 1.5 percent boost to salaries, with increases for inflation. But the union had asked for a signing bonus around twice that offered by the company, and had requested a salary increase of 5 percent, leaving a wide gap between the two sides.

A total of 2,330 members voted on strike action, with 1,955 supporting it and 370 accepting the company’s final offer, with four blank votes and one spoiled ballot, according to the statement. “We hope that given this clear wish to reject the company’s offer, which has been expressed in a mature and democratic way by our bases, the company will see the need to find an agreement that recognizes our rights,” it added. BHP, which told Reuters earlier on Wednesday that it would not comment on the vote overnight, is expected to request government mediation to attempt a resolution, which could delay any strike action for as many as 10 days. A looming strike at Escondida comes a little more than a year after a 44-day walk-off at the mine jolted global copper markets and docked economic growth in the South American country, which is the world’s top copper producer. The decision to strike had been widely expected as a partial count of votes circulated by the union on Tuesday suggested an overwhelming majority of its workers favored the strike. The Anglo-Australian miner’s final offer, presented to workers last week, included an approximately $18,000 signing bonus, and a 1.5 percent boost to salaries, with increases for inflation. But the union had asked for a signing bonus around twice that offered by the company, and had requested a salary increase of 5 percent, leaving a wide gap between the two parties ahead of the vote."
-9.19137592317551," RPT-COLUMN-BHP, Rio deals show lack of options beyond shareholder returns: Russell (Repeats with no changes to text) LAUNCESTON, Australia, July 31 (Reuters) - Two recent deals by the world’s two biggest mining companies both looked positive for shareholders, but also underscore the challenges facing major commodity producers. BHP Billiton last week agreed to sell its U.S. shale oil and gas assets for $10.5 billion, while Rio Tinto appears on track to exit its troubled investment in the giant Grasberg copper and gold mine in Indonesia for about $3.5 billion. Both deals were generally well-received by investors, largely because they resolve long-running sores for the mining giants and will likely result in a return of the proceeds to shareholders. BHP Chief Executive Andrew Mackenzie has said the proceeds of the sale of the U.S. shale assets will be returned to shareholders, but hasn’t yet given details of how and when. Rio Tinto has been cautious over the announced agreement to sell its Indonesian unit to the state-owned miner PT Inalum, which would effectively mean selling its 40 percent interest in Grasberg, which is operated by Freeport-McMoRan Inc. However, the chances are good that at least some of the proceeds, should the deal be finalised, will wind up in the hands of shareholders. While investors are usually pleased to get their hands on a pile of cash, the fact that BHP intends to hand over the cash and Rio Tinto may do the same illustrates that there really are very few suitable investment opportunities. Mining companies were heavily criticised for over-investing in the last boom period, which ended in 2011 and was followed by five years of declining prices for most major commodities, such as iron ore and coal. This resulted in the companies turning their focus to operational efficiencies and boosting returns to shareholders, a shift that is still the current mantra most often heard from top mining executives. But while this was a necessary change in mindset, it is also a strategy that’s unlikely to work in the long term. BHP retains offshore crude oil assets in the United States, and its interest in liquefied natural gas in Australia. But the sale of the shale oil and gas assets, mainly to BP Plc, is an effective retreat from a business that has transformed the global energy landscape. Exiting shale also came at a substantial overall price for BHP, given the assets cost about $20 billion when purchased in 2011 and have been written down in value several times since then. Handing the money back to shareholders through boosted dividends or a share buyback will provide investors with a sugar hit, but do little to enhance the long-term value of BHP. BHP’s biggest division is its Western Australia iron ore, and the company remains heavily exposed to the fortunes of the Chinese steel sector, the buyer of two-thirds of the world’s seaborne iron ore supplies. Rio Tinto is even more exposed to iron ore, with its operations in Western Australia accounting for about 70 percent of its earnings. Both BHP and Rio Tinto have struggled to diversify away from iron ore, and both have made costly and unsuccessful acquisitions in the past 20 years. BHP’s massive Olympic Dam copper, gold and uranium mine in South Australia has had problems ramping up production, while similar issues have impacted Rio Tinto’s Oyu Tolgoi copper mine in Mongolia. These assets are good enough to be worth investing time, money and effort to get them working efficiently, but the difficulties both companies have encountered show there are probably no easy major projects left in the world. This poses the question: What next for BHP, Rio Tinto and other major miners such as Anglo American and Brazil’s Vale ? They run the risk of being companies that can return cash to shareholders in the good times, but will lag when commodity prices go through the inevitable cyclical downturns.

The S&P/ASX 200 index rose 5.3 points, less than 0.1 percent, to 6283.8 by 0202 GMT. The benchmark fell 0.4 percent on Monday, but was still set to show a rise for a fourth consecutive month, though technical analysis suggested some correction could be due. “But it does suggest that there are valuation impacts holding back the overall market and that in a technical sense this is the top of the range for the moment,” said Greg McKenna, chief market strategist at CFD and FX provider AxiTrader BHP jumped to its highest in nearly four years and was the biggest boost to the overall index, rising as much as 1.7 percent. “BHP’s getting the credit from selling its shale assets. People are hanging on because they think potentially there will be capital management like a buy-back, or even higher dividends,” said Mathan Somasundaram, a Blue Ocean Equities market portfolio strategist. Despite the inevitable prospect of a strike at the global miner’s Escondida mine in Chile, investors are still locking in positions after the company promised to return proceeds to shareholders from it’s U.S. shale assets sale to BP Plc. Workers at Escondida, the world’s largest copper mine, are expected to officially reject BHP’s final contract offer by Wednesday following meetings last week. Telstra, which has faced significant headwinds this year, is among the top gainers on the index, rising over a percent and on track for a third straight session of gains. On Monday, the under pressure telecom firm announced a management shake-up, naming a new chief financial officer and senior management at its infrastructure division, another move in a strategic reset. Financials and energy stocks also contributed to the index’s gains, with Westpac Banking and Woodside Petroleum among the top. Wall Street fell overnight as U.S. stocks took another battering from the rout in technology stocks which has extended on the back of disappointing results from the big players. Down the index, gold explorer Regis Resources was the biggest percentage loser, down as much as 13 percent as the firm reported soft guidance. New Zealand’s benchmark S&P/NZX 50 index inched 0.1 percent lower or 12.03 points to 8,909.35. Index heavyweights a2 Milk Company and Fletcher Building topped the losses, down 1.3 percent and 0.8 percent, respectively. Fonterra said on Tuesday that its total milk production in the region rose 11 percent in June, highlighting falling global diary prices which have been undercut by increased production.

-9.21477755858977," Union official at Chile's Escondida mine predicts 'overwhelming' vote against BHP offer SANTIAGO (Reuters) - The union at BHP’s Escondida mine in Chile, the world’s largest copper mine, is expected to overwhelmingly reject the final contract offer from the Anglo-Australian miner, increasing the likelihood of a strike, a union leader told Reuters on Monday. Union members have until Wednesday to finish voting on the company’s proposal, when the union will conduct an official count. After that, either party can call for a period of government-mediated arbitration that could last as many as 10 days. “Half our members have voted,” said union spokesman Carlos Allendes. “We hope for positive and overwhelming results, with around 80 percent rejecting the offer from Escondida.” BHP declined to comment on the union’s latest statements. Copper prices fell on Monday as investors shrugged off the potential strike at Escondida and focused instead on economic data this week expected to show slowing growth in top metals consumer China. A 44-day strike at the mine last year jolted global copper markets and slowed economic growth in the South American country, which is the world’s top copper producer. After several meetings last week, unionized workers at Escondida concluded that BHP’s final contract offer did not meet union demands, according to an internal document viewed by Reuters. The company’s final offer, presented to workers last week, had included an approximately $18,000 signing bonus, and a 1.5 percent boost to salaries, with increases for inflation, according to a BHP summary of the contract offer viewed by Reuters. The union in June asked for a signing bonus around twice that now offered by the company, and a salary increase of 5 percent. The total contract offer, which is equivalent to roughly 18 million pesos ($27,700), also includes a one-time payment as compensation for the end of a housing benefits plan. Earlier on Monday, workers at Codelco’s Chuquicamata copper mine in Chile, the state miner’s second largest by output, walked off the job in protest at the “unjustified layoff” of two workers."
-9.21477755858977," RPT-FOCUS-How BP found shale profits with 'crystal ball' oilfield technology (Repeats for additional clients with no changes in text) * Companies harness big data, hi-tech to boost shale profits * BP’s $10 bln BHP shale buyout reflects confidence in sector LUFKIN, Texas/LONDON, July 30 (Reuters) - In the pine forests of eastern Texas, oilfield workers equipped with virtual-reality goggles are helping BP’s shale business turn a profit for the first time. Thousands of automated wells feed data on their performance into the firm’s supercomputers each evening. If they show a need for maintenance, an Uber-style system summons a subcontracted repair firm to keep the shale wells flowing at optimal output and minimal cost. Such technology has helped slash BP’s shale oil and natural gas production costs by 34 percent over five years. The shale business turned a profit for the first time in 2017, BP said, although the company declined to disclose the figure. BP’s progress in shale underpinned its $10.5 billion acquisition last week of BHP Billiton’s U.S. shale operations. The deal highlighted BP’s newfound confidence in a sector that has challenged oil majors, which initially struggled to adjust to the quick pace and fast-evolving methods used to tap shale with horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. BP and other majors that had traditionally focused on large, multi-year conventional drilling projects - such as Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron - were left behind when the shale boom took off a decade ago. The British energy giant is now catching up with smaller rivals, using technology and its institutional knowledge from global operations to push shale into a second phase that it hopes will reward its massive scale over the agility of smaller competitors. “We spent the last four years retooling our business and getting ready for this opportunity,” David Lawler, who heads BP’s shale business, said in a call with analysts after the BHP deal announcement. “We’re at the lowest production costs we’ve seen in many years. We’ll take that model, put that to work on these (BHP) assets and dramatically improve production and performance.” BP faces other large rivals in the race to grow U.S. shale production and profits, including Exxon Mobil Corp, Chevron, Shell and Norway’s Equinor. All are expanding drilling and acquisitions, particularly in the Permian Basin of West Texas and New Mexico, the largest U.S. oil field and the center of the shale revolution. They aim to capitalize on the vast resources unearthed by new drilling technologies, which also allow companies to start and stop production quickly in response to market shifts. That’s a key advantage over the long-term commitments of billions of dollars required by offshore oil or liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects. The BHP deal will transform BP into one of the world’s biggest shale oil and gas producers. BP’s total shale output will increase from 315,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed) to more than 500,000 boed. Its reserves will jump 57 percent to 12.7 billion barrels of oil equivalent. BP’s output of shale oil - which is worth more than natural gas - is poised to rise from about 10,000 barrels of oil per day (bpd) to about 200,000 bpd by the middle of the next decade. The deal, BP’s first major acquisition in 20 years, also marked a watershed moment for the company in the United States as it looks to leave behind the $65 billion fallout from the deadly 2010 explosion of its Deepwater Horizon rig in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico. The BHP deal will also re-establish BP as a major player in the Permian Basin. BP had sold all of its assets there to Apache Corp in August 2010, right after the Gulf disaster. Today, BP operates more than 1,000 shale wells that produce mostly natural gas in the Haynesville basin, which straddles eastern Texas, Arkansas and Louisiana. It has used the data from its automated wells to create a streamlined system that farms out maintenance to a fleet of lower-cost contractors. The firm now orders up repairs much in the same way a homeowner uses a mobile app to hire a maintenance person or a passenger summons an Uber for a ride. BP puts repair work out for bid to pre-approved contractors, who then compete for jobs. Each contractor is rated after completing the work, and those with high rankings have a better chance of getting hired again. “This means we’re not hiring and firing staff all the time depending on market conditions,” said Brian Pugh, chief operating office of BP’s shale division, which the company created as a stand-alone unit in 2015. BP equips field staff and contractors with augmented reality goggles to make repairs more efficient, modeling its methods in part on “Pokemon Go,” a popular video game where virtual images appear to be in real-world surroundings on the player’s screen. The field workers are connected through their headsets to BP’s Houston offices, where experts can see and show staff how to perform repairs while they work. BP has started to collect many of these fixes in a video library so staff can call up videos, much like YouTube, to fix problems themselves without expert consultation. The company’s algorithms crunch data compiled from its wells each evening. Operators wake up each morning to a report telling them which wells may need repair, a task that once took hours each day as workers drove from well to well in search of problems. The systems, BP said, cut downtime for wells needing repairs by 50 percent, boosting production last year by 70 million cubic feet of natural gas across its shale portfolio. The technology provides a panoramic view into the ongoing needs of the oilfield, said Kimberly Krieger, who overseas BP’s shale operations in eastern Texas. “It’s like looking into a crystal ball,” Krieger said. The firm’s success in reducing costs reflects its ability to spend money automating its oil fields and overhaul work processes to drive down service and equipment costs. BP also separated its shale business from the main company to allow the business, now headquartered in Denver, to form its own culture. “We’re able to leverage the best parts of our global business to boost our shale operations,” Pugh said. “Our smaller shale rivals in the U.S. don’t necessarily have that.” Other majors are shooting for the same results. Exxon expects its shale operations to produce $5 billion in profit by 2022, compared to a $2 billion loss in 2016. Chevron expects 10 percent of its profit to come from the Permian by 2020 after it lost money there during the oil downturn of 2014 to 2016. Shell forecasts that shale operations will make money for the first time next year and cash flow will hit $1 billion by 2020. “We use our global size to our advantage when we negotiate with suppliers.” Greg Guidry, who recently retired as Shell’s shale boss, told Reuters in March. “Costs keep coming down.”"

BHP provided a strong lift for the S&P/ASX 200 index , which closed 0.9 percent higher at 6,300.2, enough to score a second straight week of gains. Nearly a year after putting its U.S. shale assets up for sale and after months of market anticipation, BHP agreed to sell its shale oil and gas assets for $10.8 billion, with BP Plc picking up most of them. The better than expected sale price and the resulting expectations of an enticing future share buy-back provided a fillip to shares, which rose over 2 percent to their to their highest in more than two months. “I think it (the deal) has certainly increased the likelihood of a buy-back and buy-backs have certainly been something that’s been driving markets globally,” said Damien Rooney, director of equity sales at Argonaut. In contrast to BHP’s fortunes, shares of AMP slid over 5 percent to their lowest in nearly 15 years after the firm warned costs stemming from an inquiry into financial sector misconduct would eat into first-half profits. The wealth manager had flagged A$530 million ($391.46 million)of costs it would to use to compensate customers for poor advice, among other things, while saying underlying net profit for the first-half would fall to between A$490 million and A$500 million, lower than a year prior. The Royal Commission has exposed systemic wrongdoing at AMP, wiping A$5.5 billion from its market value since it began in February, with Friday’s trading update providing an early financial impact from the inquiry. Nonetheless, financials held up as the top constituents on the benchmark led gainers. The ‘Big Four’ banks gained within a range of 0.7 percent to 1.6 percent, with Australia and New Zealand Banking occupying the top spot among the banks.

Nearly a year after putting its U.S. shale assets up for sale and after months of market anticipation, BHP agreed to sell the shale oil and gas assets for $10.8 billion, with BP Plc picking up most of them. BHP shares were up 2.7 percent on Friday to their highest in more than two months, underscoring the deal’s better-than-expected sale price and expectations of a lucrative share buy-back. “I think it (the deal) has certainly increased the likelihood of a buy-back and buy-backs have certainly been something that’s been driving markets globally,” said Damien Rooney, director of equity sales at Argonaut. The deal ends a disastrous seven-year investment in the shale oil business, which triggered investors, led by U.S. hedge fund Elliott Management, to press BHP to dump its shale business. The sale news helped drive the S&P/ASX 200 index up 0.9 percent to 6,298.4 by 0202 GMT. The benchmark ended slightly down on Thursday, but was set to eke out gains for the week. AMP Ltd fell as much as 4.9 percent to its lowest in nearly 15 years after the wealth manager said its underlying first-half profit would be down by A$490 million to A$500 million ($361.47 million-$368.85 million), from a year ago. The fall was due to a company-wide “reset” after a national inquiry found several instances of misconduct, AMP said, noting it was targeting a total fiscal 2018 dividend payout at the lower end of its 70-90 percent guidance range. “(Lower dividend) That’s probably why the shareholders who are pretty beaten up will be really concerned today,” Argonaut’s Rooney said.

-9.737876381000191," Chile's Escondida copper mine makes final offer to union (Reuters) - The world’s largest copper mine, BHP’s Escondida in Chile, said on Tuesday it had made a final offer in talks with the union representing its rank-and-file workers that includes a beefed up contract signing bonus and a 1.5 percent increase in wages. The Anglo-Australian miner offered a final signing bonus of $27,700, compared to its previous offer of $23,000. The 1.5 percent salary increase compared to a previous offer of a flat salary with increases only for inflation. The union had requested a 5 percent salary increase and a bonus of up to $40,000 per worker. The closely watched talks come little more than one year after failure to reach a labor deal at the mine led to a 44-day strike that jolted the global copper market. “We don’t want to go to strike and we’re sure the great majority of workers don’t want to either,” said Patricio Vilaplana, vice-president of corporate affairs for Escondida. “For that reason we took this decision, which maintains existing benefits, is sustainable for the company and, above all, maintains a contract that is the best collective contract in Chilean private mining.”"

Wall Street’s positive overnight lead also helped the S&P/ASX 200 index put on 0.7 percent to 6,245.1 at the close. The benchmark fell 0.6 percent on Tuesday. The world’s biggest miner said its iron ore output rose 3 percent during the three months through June, topping forecasts, and set its fiscal 2019 production target slightly higher.

Even an expected $650 million charge to fiscal 2018 results to cover the failure of the Samarco Dam in Brazil did not dampen investor sentiment. “Everyone knew there was a charge coming; that was probably towards the lower end of the worst-case scenario.

-4.307884325131857," BHP posts record annual iron ore output, beats fourth-quarter forecasts (Reuters) - Global miner BHP Billiton Ltd posted record iron ore output for fiscal 2018 on Wednesday as fourth-quarter production topped expectations and set a slightly higher target for the current year. Shares in the miner jumped more than 3 percent after both quarterly and full-year production rose 3 percent on improved productivity. “BHP’s FY18 production was in line with or slightly better than our expectations in all major segments,” Jefferies said in a report. “We maintain our Hold rating on BHP shares, but we have become more constructive due to recent strong operational performance and a reduced valuation,” it said, adding that it expects a $2 billion-plus share buyback when BHP reports financial results next month. Iron ore output at the world’s biggest miner rose to 72 million tonnes during the three months through June, compared with 70 million tonnes a year ago. Full-year production came in at 275 million tonnes. BHP set a fiscal 2019 production target of 273-283 million tonnes. “We have delivered a strong finish to the 2018 financial year with an 8 per cent increase in annual production and record output at Western Australia Iron Ore, Queensland Coal and at our Spence copper mine in Chile,” BHP Chief Executive Andrew Mackenzie said. BHP also said that it expects to record a charge of $650 million in its fiscal 2018 results following the 2015 Samarco dam failure in Brazil that killed 19 people. The charge was at the low end of expectations, analysts said. “The hit they have taken is at the lesser end of the scale, which could also be the reason why the stock is performing well today,” said Christopher Conway, head of research and trading at Australian Stock Report. BHP shares rose 3.2 percent by 0244 GMT, around the middle of its trading range over the past two months after a strong run-up earlier in the year. BHP also said that its plan to divest its underperforming U.S. shale oil and gas business is on track, and added that it expects to announce one or more transactions in coming months for a complete exit by the end of 2018. The race for BHP’s onshore shale assets in the Eagle Ford, Permian, Haynesville and Fayetteville basins, is being led by British oil giant BP Plc which made an offer worth well in excess of $10 billion, people familiar with the matter told Reuters in June. In a key area the company has targeted for growth, BHP said it had increased its stake to 50 percent in the Samurai prospect in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, where recent drilling found hydrocarbons “in multiple horizons”, which had not been found in a previous exploration well in the area."

The S&P/ASX 200 index rose 0.8 percent, or 47.2 points to 6,250.8 by 0200 GMT. The benchmark dropped 0.6 percent on Tuesday. Global miner BHP said its iron ore production in the three months through June rose 3 percent to 72 million tonnes, and has set a bigger target for fiscal 2019. “It think the majority of the gains that we are seeing is because BHP is performing well and that is bleeding out into the rest of the materials sector,” said Christopher Conway, head of research and trading at Australian Stock Report. The news sent BHP’s shares up as much as 3.6 percent, their biggest intra-day percentage gain in more than four months, pulling up the mining index by 1.8 percent. Even an expected $650 million charge to fiscal 2018 results to cover the failure of the Samarco Dam in Brazil did not dampen investor sentiment. “Everyone knew there was a charge coming; that was probably towards the lower end of the worst-case scenario. I think the hit they have taken is at the lesser end of the scale,” Conway said. Financials were the second biggest boost to the index, with Commonwealth Bank of Australia up 0.8 percent.

Similarly, gold prices dropped more than 1 percent overnight after upbeat testimony to Congress from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell on the U.S. economy. Gold recovered slightly in early Asian trade. Concerns that the Fed will stick to its plan of two further rate hikes this year will likely make gold more expensive to own since bullion does not earn any interest or dividends, and costs money to store and insure.

1.9352882629910928," BP in lead to acquire BHP's U.S. onshore shale assets: sources (Reuters) - BP Plc BP.L is in the lead to acquire the U.S. onshore shale oil and gas assets of BHP Billiton Ltd BHP.AXBLT.L after submitting an offer worth well in excess of $10 billion, people familiar with the matter said on Friday. The move represents a big bet by BP on U.S. oil and gas production at a time when energy prices are rebounding. It would allow it to significantly rebalance its business with oil production, after focusing largely on natural gas assets. BP is the front-runner in the auction for the assets run by BHP, and could reach a deal in coming weeks, the sources added, cautioning that an agreement is not certain and it is possible that negotiations could end unsuccessfully. The exact terms and composition of BP’s offer could not be learned. The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. BP and BHP did not immediately respond to requests for comment. BHP said in August it aimed to sell onshore shale assets in the Eagle Ford, Permian, Haynesville and Fayetteville basins, which it acquired at the height of the oil boom. It had come under pressure from activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp to do so. The acreage for sale includes holdings that BHP acquired in its $12-billion takeover of Petrohawk Energy in 2011, which have declined rapidly in value as the price of natural gas has fallen from $4.50 at the time of the deal to a low of $1.60 last year. In 2015, BP began operating its onshore U.S. business as a separate entity to make it more competitive. Since then, BP has expanded the business to include acreage in the Haynesville and Bossier shale plays near the Texas–Louisiana border. However, BP’s expansion in U.S. shale fell behind many of it peers. When others were building out their presence onshore, BP’s focus was on the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon oil-spill disaster in the Gulf of Mexico, which has forced it to pay tens of billions of dollars in damages and restitution since 2010. If completed, the acquisition of BHP’s acreage would be transformational for BP’s unit, adding oil-rich wells in the Permian and Eagle Ford basins of Texas. Other oil majors that participated in the auction for the assets include Royal Dutch Shell Plc RDSa.L and Chevron Corp CVX.N, sources have said.

1.9352882629910928," Labor talks at BHP's Escondida mine in Chile enter 'home stretch' SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Labor negotiations at BHP Billiton Plc Escondida copper mine in Chile, the world’s largest, are entering into the final three weeks before a 30-month contract expires at the end of July. The closely watched talks come little more than one year after failure to reach a labor deal at the sprawling deposit led to a 44-day strike that jolted the global copper market. BHP and the union have reached agreement on about one-fifth of the “points of interest,” raised by either party, according to an internal union document seen by Reuters that summarized progress in negotiations during the month of June. The union filed its demands with the company on June 1. The proposals include a one-time bonus equivalent to 4 percent of dividends distributed to shareholders in 2017, or between approximately $34,000 and $40,000 per worker, depending on the exchange rate and other factors. The union also requested a 5 percent increase in workers’ salaries. BHP’s initial response on June 11 made no mention of either salary adjustments or the signing bonus. A Reuters point-by-point review of sticking points suggested the two parties were yet to reach a consensus in several areas. Carlos Allendes, a union official, confirmed to Reuters that they were “far from agreement” and accused BHP of “stubbornness.” Patricio Vilaplana, Escondida’s vice president for corporate affairs, told reporters on Thursday the company was “calm” about the negotiations and the union has shown “good faith” at the negotiating table. [L1N1U201Y] According to a progress update seen by Reuters that included BHP´s proposals and the union response, the main bones of contention are: * NEW HEALTHCARE PLAN: BHP wants to bid out its existing healthcare plan. The union wants coverage guarantees in writing and to take part in bidding. * CONTRACT BENEFITS: The company wants to extend benefits and the signing bonus to non-unionized workers. The union called some of the changes “discriminatory.” * GOOD PRACTICE BONUSES: BHP has proposed changes to “operational practice” standards that earn workers a daily bonus for good behavior. * PRODUCTION GOAL BONUS: BHP has raised this to $7,700 but also boosted the production goal to 98 percent from 96 percent to 97 percent. The union said the higher goal brought greater risk to workers and to product quality. WHAT´S CHANGED SINCE LAST YEAR´S NEGOTIATIONS? Workers last year invoked a legal provision that allowed them to extend their current contract through July 2018, allowing the implementation of a new labor law passed under former center-left Chilean President Michelle Bachelet that allows workers to use existing benefits as the “floor” for current negotiations. Last year’s impasse also brought an additional, unexpected benefit to unions: A sharp increase in the price of copper on the London Metal Exchange - more than 50 percent since hitting a nine-year low in 2016. The price hike prompted the union to kick off negotiations with demands that included a bonus of up to $40,000. In recent weeks however, the U.S.-China trade dispute has reversed the trend, sending the copper price to a nine-month low. Allendes said the lows were temporary and would have little bearing on negotiations. Kash Kamal, a research associate at BMO Capital Markets, told Reuters that amid an “aggressive sell-off” of copper over the past 10 days because of the trade dispute, it remained unclear what impact a strike would have. “Labor negotiations certainly helped support prices in the first half of the year, and the contract talks that have concluded have done so with very little disruption,” he said. “However, investors are split down the middle when it comes to Escondida and recent comments from union officials haven’t struck the most positive tone.” BHP has called the bonus “exaggerated,” and said it exceeded even the demands of the union in 2013, with copper prices approaching record highs. But the generally robust copper price and strengthened labor laws suggest the union has substantial leverage in the ongoing Escondida negotiations. Joaquin Villarino, an industry veteran and head of Consejo Minero, Chile´s mining industry group, said a big bonus could serve to eliminate more permanent benefits that made contracts more expensive and miners less competitive. The Escondida talks come halfway through a big year for labor negotiations at Chile´s copper mines, including 19 at top producer Codelco. Though Codelco has thus far avoided strikes, 11 negotiations remain, including at its sprawling El Teniente deposit. “Outside of Chile, markets aren’t taking this into account,” said Juan Carlos Guajardo, an analyst with consultancy PlusMining in Santiago, citing recent tensions at Codelco’s Salvador and Chuquicamata divisions. “Escondida will be a benchmark. Because of its notoriety, it will influence (upcoming negotiations).” Conversations can continue until July 24, at which point BHP must present its final offer, according to a negotiation schedule provided by the company. Between July 27 and July 31, the union will vote to either accept the company´s offer or go on strike. After the vote, either party has as many as four days to request a period of government mediation that can last 10 days. If there is no agreement when the mediation process ends, a strike would begin the following business day."

The official, Carlos Allendes, said the union was preparing a $400,000 emergency fund to support workers if they opt to strike after the company offers its final proposal on July 24. He condemned the AngloAustralian miner for exhibiting “the same stubbornness” that last year led to a 44-day strike that jolted the global copper market. Allendes said that despite BHP’s setting up a negotiating table in mid-June, conversation with its managers had been “scarce.” “We have not been able to reach any agreements,” he said. “Our positions are very far apart, there is much distance between us. The company has made no concessions. It makes it hard to negotiate.” Escondida’s vice president for corporate affairs, Patricio Vilaplana, told reporters on Thursday that the company was “calm” about the negotiations and said the union had shown “good faith” at the negotiating table. “We hope that continues going forward,” Vilaplana said. Copper prices have dropped for nine consecutive days, amid fears of a trade war between the United States and China. Allendes said, however, that the depressed price would not weaken the union’s demands, describing the decline as purely transitory. Escondida’s costs are just over one third of the current price of the raw material, he added, and the mine made a $483 million profit in the first quarter of this year compared to a loss of $184 million the previous year because of the strike. “They cannot keep pretending that workers should have no right to a share of those millions of profits,” he said. The union is seeking a 4 percent share of the mine’s profits, through a 5 percent increase in salaries and a bonus of between 22 million pesos and 24 million pesos ($33,500 and $36,000) per worker. Vilaplana said the bonus sought by workers was “outside of what the industry has been paying.”"

The agreement, signed by prosecutors from the federal government and the states of Minas Gerais and Espirito Santo, mandates improvements in governance for the Renova Foundation, created to help victims of the accident, Vale said. In a separate statement, BHP said the agreement sets a two-year timeline to reach a settlement over a separate 155 billion reais lawsuit, which will remain suspended while the parties continue to negotiate. It did not give a timeline on licensing and when operations may resume. “It’s good that it moves along closer to a resolution obviously, and potentially caps some of the risk around (the settlement), given the earlier numbers that had been put out there,” said portfolio manager Andy Forster of Sydney’s Argo Investments, which has holdings in BHP. “But it’s still uncertain around what the size of the total settlement could actually be.” Brazil’s worst environmental catastrophe happened when a dam designed to hold back mine waste burst, leaving a trail of destruction for hundreds of kilometers. Part of the terms of the agreement announced on Monday include a greater role for affected people in the governing bodies of the Renova Foundation. The deal marks a key milestone for beleaguered Samarco, but it still faces a hefty debt load and little clarity on when it might receive key permits to resume operations. “The positive is we don’t have a big compensation number which was the market’s concern,” said analyst Glyn Lawcock at UBS in Sydney. “The negative is that we still don’t have a definitive outcome or a definitive amount, or a timeline for restart.” Vale has said it expects the company to resume operations in 2018 or early next year, but has pushed back forecasts several times. The mine still needs two permits to reopen, and the lack of a clear timeline makes it harder for the companies to renegotiate the debt load, sources have told Reuters. “It seems that if everything goes well, and the plaintiffs feel the community are being compensated fairly and the land is being rehabilitated...then there could be no more increase in cash out the door for BHP and Vale,” said UBS analyst Lawcock. “But if the plaintiffs feel that as they move forward two years and there’s still things to be done...then there may be more money to be spent, is our understanding.” ($1 = 3.7753 Brazilian reais)"

BHP and other major miners are keen on copper as a mineral expected to be in high demand for both the traditional economy and for electric vehicles, but its preference is for large-scale projects. “We look forward to adding Cerro Colorado to our portfolio as copper is one of our four core commodities and offers excellent demand and supply fundamentals for decades into the future,” EMR chief executive officer Jason Chang said in a statement. Cerro Colorado, located in the Tarapacá region, the extreme north of Chile’s copper belt, yielded 65,000 tonnes of copper in fiscal 2017. BHP’s flagship mine Escondida, which also is in Chile, yields more than 10 times that amount annually. The Cerro Colorado mine has government approval to operate until 2023 but that could be extended."
-4.05141372230993," BHP, partners to build $3.4 billion iron ore mine in Australia LONDON/MELBOURNE (Reuters) - BHP on Thursday approved $2.9 billion in spending to build a new iron ore mine in Australia, the top global miner’s biggest investment commitment in seven years. The South Flank mine in the state of Western Australia is due to produce its first ore in 2021, replacing the 80 million tonnes-per-year Yandi mine. The move is set to improve the quality of ore offered by BHP as it looks to earn more from China, the world’s biggest buyer of the steelmaking commodity. Mining executives say China is increasingly demanding high quality ore, which commands a premium and limits pollution as less ore needs to be processed, although an analysis of Reuters data shows the country is struggling to obtain it. “We wanted to target an opportunity that would allow us to play to that continued strength in demand for higher quality ore,” BHP’s Minerals Australia President Mike Henry told reporters on a conference call from London. Henry said BHP had long anticipated that shift in demand for higher quality iron ore and coking coal, as China moved its steelmaking blast furnaces to the coast, relied more on bigger blast furnaces and focused on the environment. Ore from South Flank would have an average iron content of 62-63 percent compared to Yandi’s 58 percent, lifting the proportion of BHP’s output of higher valued lump product to 35 percent, Henry said. It would also have lower amounts of phosphorus, an impurity that fetches a discount. BHP has an 85-percent stake in the South Flank project. Its Japanese partners Itochu Corp, with an 8 percent stake, and Mitsui & Co Ltd, with 7 percent, will spend $270 million and $240 million respectively, bringing the total development cost to $3.4 billion, they said. The investment comes at the same time as Rio Tinto, the world’s No.2 iron ore miner, is expected to decide soon on whether to build its Koodaideri mine in Australia at an estimated cost of $2.2 billion. Fortescue Metals Group has just approved development of a $1.3 billion project, Eliwana. Henry said BHP had a slight head start in securing equipment for its project. “We are going to see a bit of pressure in the market as a result of multiple projects being pursued at the same time. We’re pretty well positioned, given the timing of our full sanction,” he said."

The project, which should produce its first ore in 2021, will fully replace production from the 80 million tonnes-per-year Yandi mine, which is reaching the end of its economic life. In a statement BHP, which has an 85 percent stake in South Flank, said the quality of the ore would take the average grade for the company’s Western Australian iron ore to 62 percent from 61 percent. Fellow Anglo-Australian major miner Rio Tinto is ramping up a new iron ore mine at Silvergrass, also in the Pilbara, and also high grade.

-10.216812951991121," BHP, union at Chile's Spence copper mine reach labor agreement SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Unionized workers at BHP’s Spence copper mine in northern Chile agreed on Monday to a new collective labor contract, the company and the union said. The deal comes as the Anglo-Australian miner begins talks with the nearly 2,500-member union at its Escondida copper mine in northern Chile, the world’s largest, little more than a year after a historic strike shut the mine for 44 days, depriving BHP of $1 billion in production. BHP said the successful negotiations at the much smaller Spence mine demonstrated a high “degree of maturity in labor relations,” and that the deal proved it was “possible to reach mutually beneficial agreements based upon dialogue.” Ronald Salcedo, president of the workers’ union at Spence, said the new 36-month contract includes a one-time bonus of nearly $21,500 per worker and a 2 percent increase over current base salaries. The deal was approved by 87 percent of the Spence union’s approximately 900 members, Salcedo said. BHP said in August last year it plans to spend nearly $2.5 billion to extend the life of its Spence mine by more than 50 years, creating up to 5,000 jobs and bringing new output online in 2021. Spence produced 198,600 tonnes of copper in 2017."

-12.482751639434774," BHP responds to contract proposal from union at Chile's Escondida mine SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Global miner BHP said on Monday it had responded to the latest contract proposal from unionized workers at its Escondida copper mine in Chile, the world’s largest, triggering a new round of talks that could last a month or more. The union’s proposal, filed with the company in early June, included a salary increase of 5 percent and a one-time bonus of $34,000, equivalent to 4 percent of dividends distributed to shareholders. In a statement, BHP said it was now ready to discuss the “different points of interest” at the negotiating table. “The company hopes ... to reach a mutually beneficial agreement, and to touch on issues like the bonus and salary increases, which were not addressed in our response,” BHP said in a statement. The company’s response marks the start of a final round of negotiations more than a year after an historic strike at Escondida in early 2017 shut down the mine for 44 days, jolting the copper market and depriving BHP of $1 billion in production. Workers at the time opted to utilize a provision of Chile’s labor law that allows unions to extend the previous contract for 18 months. Early talks began again in April, but failed to reach agreement. Copper prices have increased by more than 50 percent since hitting a nine-year low in 2016, a favorable trend that could provide unions more leverage in negotiations. Benchmark copper on the London Metal Exchange touched $7,348 a tonne last week, its highest level since January 2014, amid fears of another wave of supply disruptions at Escondida. The union at Escondida said last Friday it saw a “favorable scenario” for reaching a deal on a new labor contract with the company, citing, in part, higher copper prices. Talks at Escondida are slated to continue through July 24, at which point the company is required by Chilean law to present its final contract offer, according to a calendar provided by BHP. Unionized workers at BHP’s Spence copper mine, a much smaller operation in northern Chile, late on Sunday approved a new labor contract, including a bonus of $21,500 per worker."

-11.65486296464028," Escondida union in Chile optimistic will reach deal with BHP SANTIAGO (Reuters) - The union at BHP’s Escondida copper mine in Chile said on Friday that it saw a “favorable scenario” for reaching a deal on a new labor contract with the company, citing higher copper prices. In a letter to its members published on its website, the union at the world’s largest copper mine said BHP has promised to respond to its recent proposal for a new contract by 3pm local time (1900 GMT) on Monday. “A favorable scenario has emerged for developing negotiations to reach a satisfactory agreement,” the union said in a statement, noting that the price of copper had climbed to its strongest in 4-1/2 years this week. “We’re convinced that objective conditions justify, to investors and to the country, reaching a reasonable agreement,” it added. “With that in mind we’ll start talks.” The price of copper on the London Metal Exchange CMCU3 has risen more than 50 percent since hitting a nine-year low in 2016, boosting profits globally and potentially providing unions more leverage in negotiations. Copper prices rose this week in part because of worries that Escondida workers might go on strike. Last year, workers at Escondida downed tools for more than month and a half before opting to extend the current contract and renegotiate a new one this year. The 2017 strike jolted the global copper market and deprived BHP of $1 billion in production. Formal negotiations between the union and BHP are scheduled to begin in July. Earlier this week, the union said it was asking for a 5 percent increase in salaries and a one-time bonus equivalent to 4 percent of dividends distributed to shareholders in 2017, or about $34,000 per worker."
-5.877665205242319," RPT-BHP process to unload U.S. shale operations could take until 2019 (Repeats for wider distribution.) NEW YORK, June 4 (Reuters) - The planned exit of BHP Billiton Ltd from its U.S. shale business has drawn oil companies and private equity firms into a competition that may have no clear winner until late this year or early next year, according to people familiar with the negotiations. BHP, the world’s largest miner, said in August that it would exit its U.S. shale oil and gas business after pressure from activist hedge fund Elliott Management, which owns a stake in the company and argued the unit was a drag on BHP’s value. The Anglo-Australian company’s Houston-based BHP Petroleum unit holds more than 838,000 acres spread across four U.S. shale plays: Texas’ Permian and Eagle Ford basins and the Haynesville and Fayetteville formations of Arkansas. A divestiture of all of that land would be among the largest shale acreage sales to date. BHP is offering to sell off acreage in seven different packages spanning three formations; it has generated interest from oil companies that paired with private equity firms to bid on all the assets, as well as from companies looking at individual packages. First bids were received last week, but no deal is expected until very late in 2018 or early 2019, according to two of the people familiar with the matter who, like all the sources, could not speak for attribution as the negotiations are not public. It was currently unclear whether BHP may hold a second bid round with certain bidders or all of them, or it may opt to continue weighing the received bids toward securing a preferred deal. The long delay can be explained by the sheer scale of the process and the number of parties involved, although bankers have also been critical of BHP’s approach which has been regarded as slow-moving throughout. Bidders include consortiums of Royal Dutch Shell Plc and Blackstone Group LP, advised by Jefferies; and Chevron Corp partnered with Warburg Pincus, the people familiar with the matter said. Apollo Global Management LLC is bidding solo, while BP Plc Chief Executive Bob Dudley told Reuters last month that it could place a bid. A BHP spokeswoman declined to comment on the details of the sale. However, Chief Executive Officer Andrew Mackenzie said at a conference in Florida last month that there was “encouraging interest from potential bidders,” and that the higher oil prices and lower U.S. corporate tax rates than when the plan was first announced last summer were supporting the process. BP, Shell, Chevron, Blackstone and Warburg Pincus declined to comment. Apollo did not respond to a comment request. BHP values the entirety of the acreage at $14 billion, but analysts have pegged the total value of the assets lower - at a maximum of $9 billion. Bidding in consortiums would allow the integrated oil companies to focus on acreage that complemented their holdings, such as that in the Permian, while the private equity firms would take on gas-rich acreage in the Haynesville formation. The acreage includes holdings that BHP acquired in its $12 billion takeover of Petrohawk Energy in 2011, as appetite for shale gas assets reached fever pitch. Shale gas assets have lost value as natural gas prices fell from about $4.50 in mid 2011 to a low of $1.60 in 2016. Prices have since recovered to about $2.93 per MMBtu. Buyout houses are also dominant in the sale process for the gassy Fayetteville assets, the bid deadline for which was in late April, having been marketed separately from the rest of BHP’s shale portfolio. Barclays Plc and Bank of America-Merrill Lynch are running the sale process. Citigroup and Goldman Sachs had also helped BHP research the potential spin-off of the unit into a new company, should divestment prove unachievable, Reuters previously reported."

1.5078510885211196," BHP cuts 2018 iron ore forecast, cites rail car upload problems MELBOURNE (Reuters) - BHP Billiton Ltd cut its 2018 fiscal year iron ore output guidance on Thursday citing issues in its railroad car unloading system, while also slightly raising its copper output expectations given higher production at the Escondida mine. The miner cut projections for fiscal 2018 iron ore production by 2 percent to between 272-274 million tonnes of iron ore from 275-280 million tonnes due to “car dumper reliability issues.” A car dumper is a machine that unloads bulk cargoes from rail road cars. Overall, the outcome of the global miner’s third quarter production was balanced as lower iron ore output and eased guidance should be broadly offset by a slight pick up in third quarter copper production and upgraded guidance, said Sydney-based brokerage Shaw and Partners in a report. BHP narrowed its full-year copper guidance to 1.70-1.785 million tonnes from the earlier range of 1.655-1.790 million tonnes, as production at the world’s biggest copper mine Escondida surged by 64 percent. Given a boom in commodity prices, BHP is also looking at a significant uplift to earnings, the broker noted. “The latest mark to market for BHP using spot forex and commodity prices – points to 20-30 percent earnings uplift,” it said. BHP shares rallied 3.1 percent on the Australian stock exchange on Thursday, in line with a broad rally across the mining sector after Russia sanctions disrupted the global aluminum supply chain and lit a fire under producers, particularly those making nickel, aluminum, alumina. “The 2018 March quarterly result was softer than our estimates across the board, with the exception of the copper group, where Escondida performed solidly and improved utilization rates at Pampa Norte offset a slower than expected ramp-up at Escondida,” said RBC analyst Paul Hissey in a report. “We view BHP as fair value, and view the stock as on par with RIO,” he said. BHP said its copper production target was affected by a “slower than planned” ramp-up in production during the March quarter at its Olympic Dam facility in South Australia. BHP’s iron ore output rose to 67 million tonnes in the three months ended March 31, compared with 62 million tonnes a year ago. BHP also noted that it had approval from regulators to increase capacity at its Port Hedland operations to 290 million tonnes of iron ore per annum which it intends to reach by the end of fiscal 2019, it said. “BHP remains on track to achieve six per cent volume growth for the 2018 financial year,” BHP Chief Executive Andrew Mackenzie said in the group’s quarterly operations review. The miner said its decision to exit its underperforming U.S. shale oil and gas business last year was going as planned. BHP reiterated it expected bids by June 2018 and added that transactions could be announced in the first half of the 2019 financial year.
