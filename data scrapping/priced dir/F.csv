6.211723534558187," CORRECTED (OFFICIAL)-UPDATE 2-Ford latest automaker to shut North American plants on U.S. winter weather Freezing weather that interrupted gas supplies in the southern United States and Mexico was wreaking havoc on Thursday on car manufacturing plants on both sides of the border, with Ford Motor Co (F.N), Nissan Motor Co Ltd (7201.T) and Toyota Motor Corp (7203.T) reporting disruptions to their assembly lines. The cold snap has overwhelmed Texas' power grid, while natural gas supplies to Mexico from Texas were interrupted, leaving millions without power in Mexico's industrial northern states earlier in the week. In Texas, freezing temperatures are expected to last through Saturday. read more Mexico generates most of its power from natural gas, largely imported from the United States. The two countries also require intricate supply chains to be functional to supply auto and other industrial operations on both sides of the border. In six Mexican states, significant power cuts contributed to the suspension of operations at auto assembly plants, according to Mexican auto association AMIA. Some car factories also use natural gas on their production lines. Fewer supplies have meant at least five plants reported cutting their consumption of the fuel by between 20% and 30% since Tuesday, the association added. Ford on Thursday said adverse weather had led to the temporary closure of plants in Kansas City, Michigan and Kentucky, as well as a plant in Hermosillo in the northern Mexican border state of Sonora. Late on Wednesday, Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE) said it would suspend some production in Mexico on Thursday and Friday due to limited natural gas supply. The cut in supply also affected Audi as well as General Motors Co's (GM.N) plant in the central city of Silao, where work stopped on Tuesday night and Wednesday. GM said on Thursday that first-shift operations were canceled at plants in Arlington, Texas; Spring Hill, Tennessee; and Bowling Green, Kentucky. The first two factories also would likely be closed for the second shift. Other automakers affected by the winter weather include Toyota and Nissan. Toyota said its Texas plant would be idled through Friday, while first shifts would not operate on Thursday at plants in Mississippi and Alabama. In Mexico, the automaker said it would reduce shifts and suspend work in the coming days at its plants in Baja California and Guanajuato. Nissan said production at plants in Smyrna, Tennessee, and Canton, Mississippi, remain suspended, and that in Mexico it was halting some production in Aguascalientes while seeking to quickly switch to liquefied petroleum gas at other plants. Ford's Kansas City plant's operations have been canceled from Feb. 13-22, the company said. Mexico, Latin America's second-largest economy, has reeled as gas imports via pipeline from Texas dropped by about 75% over the last week, causing billions of dollars of losses on power outages and factory closures. read more "
6.211723534558187," Exclusive: Ford puts projects with Mahindra on hold as it reassesses India strategy - sources NEW DELHI/DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor has frozen all projects it was working on with Mahindra & Mahindra while it finalises a new India strategy, three people familiar with the U.S. carmaker’s plans told Reuters, weeks after the two companies called off their planned joint venture. “The options could include working out a new relationship with Mahindra or ending the relationship and related vehicles completely,” one of the sources said. The two other sources said they expect Ford to make a decision in about a month on whether to proceed with Mahindra in a different form or not, adding Ford Chief Executive Jim Farley wants to see a path to greater profitability in India. Ford and Mahindra had proposed a joint venture to develop at least three sport-utility vehicles (SUVs) for India and emerging markets, as well as share suppliers, powertrains and technology. The $275 million deal, which would have ended most of Ford’s independent operations in India, was called off on Dec. 31. Since Farley became CEO in October, Ford has pushed harder to remake itself globally as part of an $11 billion restructuring, including ending manufacturing in Brazil, and speeding up the rollout of electric vehicles. With so much on Farley’s plate and limited financial resources, India is a lower priority, the first source said. Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford entered India 25 years ago, but it has just 3% share in a market dominated by Suzuki Motor Corp’s and Hyundai Motor’s extensive line-up of mainly low-cost cars. The tie-up with Mahindra would have given Ford a better chance against rivals by allowing it to launch new vehicles faster, at reduced costs and with lower investment, company officials and analysts previously said. Ford said its independent Indian operations will continue. “We are reviewing our businesses strategy, making choices and allocating capital consistent with the plan to achieve an 8% company adjusted EBIT margin and generate consistently strong cash flow,” spokesman Kapil Sharma said. “We will have more details to share at a later date.” For Mahindra it would have been an opportunity to enter new global markets, but it walked away from the deal over concerns its return on investment would be too low. Mahindra said in a statement that the automakers are looking at ways to collaborate. “We have defined a timeline till the end of March for this work to be completed,” the company said. Ford is weighing all programmes it had planned for the joint venture with Mahindra and will review which ones it plans to keep from a profit standpoint, the second source said. The most crucial was a mid-sized SUV to be built by Mahindra on its vehicle platform and using its powertrain. Ford planned to launch this in 2022 with a target to sell around 50,000 units annually in India, two sources said. Mahindra, too, has asked suppliers to freeze work on this, they said. Ford is also negotiating new terms, including costs, for an engine Mahindra was to supply for its EcoSport SUV later this year, one of the people said. For two other SUVs that Ford is building for launch in 2023 and 2024, the plan had been to use Mahindra engines. If it walks away from that deal, Ford will need to find another supplier or invest in upgrading its own engines, two sources said. It will come down to a cost versus profit analysis and that “hinges on discussions with Mahindra,” one of the sources said. At a town hall earlier this month, Dianne Craig, president of international operations, said Ford was exploring all options when asked about the company’s plans following the end of the Mahindra relationship. Ford’s average sales in India have languished at around 90,000 units a year prior to the economic slowdown in 2019 and the pandemic in 2020. But exports are nearly double what it sells in the domestic market and that helps it make money. While Ford India reported pre-tax profits over the last three years, its biggest hurdle in India is low plant utilisation of around 53% over a five-year average. Even as it thinks about bringing global products to India - its Territory SUV in China is an option - Ford will need to look at several factors including competition, new fuel efficiency rules and its ability to make money in a price-sensitive market to ensure success. India’s competitiveness as an export base for affordable cars will also play a role, two sources said. “If Ford decides to invest more in India it needs to know by when it can recover that investment,” one source said."
5.836236933797909," Ford's Europe car lineup to be all-electric by 2030 LONDON (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co on Wednesday said its car lineup in Europe will be all-electric by 2030 as the U.S. automaker races to get ahead of CO2 emissions targets and looming bans in some countries on fossil fuel vehicles. The carmaker said it will invest $1 billion over the next 30 months to convert its vehicle assembly plant in Cologne, Germany, to become the U.S. automaker’s first electric vehicle facility in Europe. “This reinforces our commitment to the European region,” Stuart Rowley, head of Ford’s European operations, said during a news conference. Ford said its first European-built, all-electric passenger vehicle will be produced at the facility from 2023 and is considering building a second model there. The carmaker has a strategic alliance with Volkswagen AG, under which Ford will use its German partner’s MEB electric vehicle platform to build some models. Rowley said the model out of Cologne will be the first to use Volskwagen’s MEB platform. The No.2 U.S. automaker said that by 2026 it will have electric versions of all its passenger cars on sale in Europe and that by 2030 two=thirds of its commercial vehicle sales in Europe will be fully electric or plug-in hybrids. The company said it will have plug-in hybrid or fully-electric versions of its entire commercial vehicle range available by 2024. Ford currently dominates the U.S. and European markets for gasoline-powered commercial vehicles with shares of 40% and almost 15%, respectively. The carmaker said its commercial vehicle business is “key to future growth and profitability.” Ford said this month it was “doubling down” on connected electric vehicles and said it will invest $22 billion in electrification through 2025, nearly twice what it had previously committed to EVs. This week Jaguar Land Rover, owned by India’s Tata Motors, said its luxury Jaguar brand would be entirely electric by 2025 and the carmaker will launch e-models of its entire lineup by 2030. Last month, Ford’s Detroit rival General Motors Co said it aims to an entirely zero-emission lineup by 2035."

0.8733624454148596," VW 'unintended victim' in battery supplier dispute, seeks four-year reprieve WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Volkswagen AG late Friday called itself an “unintended victim” in a battle between two battery suppliers and urged the U.S. government to extend a reprieve to buy batteries key to its planned U.S. electric vehicle production. The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) on Wednesday sided with LG Chem in a trade secrets case, but permitted SK Innovation to import components for domestic production of lithium ion batteries for Ford Motor Co’s EV F-150 program for four years, and for Volkswagen of America’s electric vehicle line for two years. VW said Friday it will request its carve out be “extended to at least four years to give an adequate transition period. Ultimately, however, it is our hope the two suppliers will settle this dispute outside of the courtroom.” The German automaker has invested $800 million to build electric vehicles in Tennessee and hiring hundreds of employees. “Volkswagen will take all necessary steps to allow us to fulfill our commitment to provide skilled jobs to proud Tennessee workers,” the automaker said. On Thursday, Ford Chief Executive Jim Farley publicly encouraged LG Chem and SK Innovation to reach a settlement. VW and Ford previously warned the dispute could disrupt supplies of the key EV parts and cost U.S. jobs during the COVID-19 pandemic. Georgia Governor Brian Kemp on Friday called on President Joe Biden to overturn the ITC ruling, warning the long-term prospects for the $2.6 billion SK Innovation battery plant in Jackson County, Georgia, would be “harmed significantly.” The plant will eventually build batteries for Volkswagen and Ford. The White House and SK Innovation declined comment. LG Energy Solution counsel Dave Callahan said the company “remains committed to negotiating a fair settlement for the theft of its trade secrets” and said the Georgia plant will be able to operate. “The only obstacle to resolving this matter and securing the plant’s long-term future is (SK Innovation’s) refusal to acknowledge its wrongdoing and make amends,” he added."

1.1353711790393082," SK Innovation loses U.S. battery trade case but gets temporary OK to sell to Ford, VW WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) on Wednesday sided with South Korea’s chemicals and electric vehicle (EV) battery maker LG Chem Ltd, which accused its cross-town rival SK Innovation Co Ltd of misappropriating trade secrets related to EV battery technology. The ITC said it was issuing a limited 10-year exclusion order prohibiting imports into the United States of some lithium-ion batteries by SK Innovation, but would permit SK to import components for domestic production of lithium ion batteries and other parts for Ford Motor Co’s EV F-150 program for four years, and for Volkswagen of America’s MEB electric vehicle line for the North America region for two years. The ITC added that SK Innovation can replace or repair its batteries in Kia vehicles sold to U.S. consumers. The move could effectively ban the company from supplying EV batteries in the United States unless the company can source all the needed materials there - a step analysts say is not feasible. The ITC said the decision would allow the automakers to transition to new suppliers for these programs. LG Chem’s wholly owned battery subsidiary LG Energy Solution, a EV battery supplier to Tesla Inc and General Motors Co, praised the ruling. “SKI’s total disregard of our warnings and intellectual property rights gave us no choice but to file this case,” Kim Jong-hyun, the CEO of LG Energy Solution, said in a statement. He said the company would “further strengthen the protection of intellectual property rights going forward.” SK Innovation, in a statement, said it regretted the ITC’s decision “but it’s a relief that we will continue to supply to Ford and Volkswagen.” SK noted there was a 60-day presidential review period in which President Joe Biden could decide to reverse the ruling.

-1.8440905280804598," GM extends vehicle production cuts due to global chip shortage DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co said on Tuesday it was extending production cuts at three North American plants until at least mid-March due to the global semiconductor chip shortage, while vehicles at two other factories would only be partially built. GM’s U.S. rival Ford Motor Co also said Tuesday that it was in limited cases parking partly assembled vehicles due to the chip shortage. GM, whose shares dipped 1.1% after the announcement, did not disclose the impact on volumes or say which supplier and vehicle parts were affected by the chip shortage. But it said it would focus on keeping production running at plants building its highest-profit vehicles: full-size pickup trucks and SUVs. GM said it intended to make up as much lost production as possible once the shortage chip eased. “Semiconductor supply remains an issue that is facing the entire industry,” GM spokesman David Barnas said. “GM’s plan is to leverage every available semiconductor to build and ship our most popular and in-demand products.” GM said it was extending downtime at its U.S. plant in Fairfax, Kansas; its Canadian factory in Ingersoll, Ontario; and its Mexican facility in San Luis Potosi until mid-March when it would reassess the situation, he said. In addition, GM said it would build but leave incomplete for final assembly vehicles at Wentzville, Missouri, and its Mexican plant at Ramos Arizpe. GM vehicles affected by the idled plants include the Chevrolet Malibu sedan, Cadillac XT4 SUV, Chevy Equinox, and GMC Terrain SUVs. Vehicles to be left incomplete for now included the Chevy Colorado, GMC Canyon pickups and Chevy Blazer SUV. This week, GM had said it was idling the three factories where it has now extended downtime and said it would halve production at a plant in South Korea. Ford’s chief product platform officer, Hau Thai-Tang, at a conference on Tuesday raised the possibility that Ford might have to park vehicles that would need parts added later because of the chip shortage. Kelli Felker, a Ford spokeswoman, later said the company was doing that “in limited cases,” but did not say what vehicles were affected. The shortage stems from a confluence of factors as auto manufacturers, which shut plants for two months during the COVID-19 pandemic last year, compete against the sprawling consumer electronics industry for chip supplies. Consumers have stocked up on laptops, gaming consoles and other electronic products during the pandemic, leading to tight chip supplies. They have also bought more cars than industry officials expected last spring, further straining supplies. The chip shortage has affected many automakers, including Toyota, Volkswagen, Stellantis, Renault, Subaru, Nissan, Honda and Mazda. VW said Tuesday it expects chip supply to remain tight in the first half of the year. AutoForecast Solutions on Tuesday updated its estimate for lost production this year, saying the global industry could lose almost 1.3 million vehicles as a result of the shortage. GM could lose an estimated 111,450 vehicles, the forecasting firm said. Honda and Nissan said on Tuesday they would sell 250,000 fewer cars in total this financial year due to the chip shortage. Ford said last week the shortage was hitting production of its highly profitable F-150 pickup trucks, saying it could lose 10% to 20% of planned first-quarter vehicle production and earnings could fall by $1 billion to $2.5 billion. Taiwan, home to the world’s largest contract chip maker, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd (TSMC), is at the center of efforts to resolve the shortage. U.S. officials discussed the issue with their Taiwanese counterparts last week. Chinese officials said on Tuesday they had met with auto and chip companies, asking them to help ease the shortage. French state officials meet with auto and electronics industry leaders on Wednesday to discuss the issue. The Mexican Automotive Industry Association (AMIA) said this week that chip shortages had hurt national auto production in January, and it would likely dampen output during the first half of 2021. The Information Technology Industry Council, which represents technology and auto companies, wrote U.S. President Joe Biden on Tuesday urging action to address the shortage, including providing “substantial funding” to ensure there will be enough chips."
0.8688097306689804," Ford says U.S. Justice Dept, California end probe into emissions issue WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co confirmed on Friday the U.S. Justice Department and California Air Resources Board have closed a lengthy investigation into the No. 2 U.S. automaker’s emissions certification process without taking any action. Ford said in a securities filing that reviews by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Environment and Climate Change Canada remain open. Ford first disclosed the criminal probe in April 2019 and earlier hired outside law firm Sidley Austin and experts to investigate its vehicle fuel economy and testing procedures after employees raised concerns about analytical modeling that is part of its fuel economy and emissions compliance process. Ford said Friday the investigations’ closure was “consistent with the company’s own investigation and conclusion that we appropriately completed our certification processes.” Ford declined to releasing findings from its own investigation and said it has not changed any fuel economy ratings as a result. Ford faces a class-action lawsuit from owners who claim Ford “cheated on its fuel economy testing on some of its best-selling and most popular trucks” and said the issue affected over a million Ford truck owners. The lawsuit claims that “independent testing conducted on Ford F-150 and Ford Ranger vehicles has vindicated the concerns of both consumers and Ford’s own employees: Ford did not follow appropriate coastdown testing procedures, and instead disclosed inaccurate resistance figures to increase the MPG Rating of its F-150 and Ranger vehicles.” Coastdown testing measures the effects of wind and road resistance on a coasting vehicle. The lawsuit said “extra fuel costs for all 2018 and 2019 F-150s” would total approximately $2.32 billion for city driving, $2.09 billion highway, and $1.9 billion combined.” Ford declined to comment on the lawsuit Friday but argues in court papers it should be dismissed, saying owners are “implausibly claiming that Ford had a duty to disclose the ‘true fuel economy’ for the subject vehicles, as if such a figure actually exists.”"
0.8688097306689804," Ford boosts investment plan for EVs and self driving vehicles, reports loss DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co on Thursday more than doubled the amount of money it plans to invest on electric and autonomous vehicles, to $29 billion, even as it posted a fourth-quarter net loss of $2.8 billion. The No. 2 U.S. automaker also said the global semiconductor chip shortage could lead to a 10% to 20% loss in first-quarter production, resulting in a potential hit to operating earnings of $1 billion to $2.5 billion. But its shares gained 1.5% in after-hours trading as the fourth-quarter operating results and 2021 profit forecast were above Wall Street’s expectations. “If EVs continue to quickly gain favor, especially with commercial customers, we want to be clear that we will not cede ground to anyone,” Chief Financial Officer John Lawler told reporters on a conference call. Ford said it was “doubling down” on connected electric vehicles and said it will invest $22 billion in electrification through 2025, nearly twice what it had previously committed to EVs. Ford also said it would invest $7 billion in self-driving, or autonomous, technology development over 10 years through 2025 – $5 billion of that from 2021 forward. “We are accelerating all our plans,” Chief Executive Jim Farley said, including increasing battery capacity and adding more electric vehicles in its future portfolio. He said on a conference call with analysts that the $22 billion investment does not include potential investment in battery production, whether through at Ford itself or via a joint venture. He added that Ford will have more announcements soon around its EV partnerships. Farley told Reuters last fall Ford was considering making its own battery cells as sales volumes of electric vehicles rise globally. Ford previously committed to invest $11.5 billion in electrification, including gasoline-electric hybrid vehicles, through 2022. That included the launch of the Mustang Mach-E EV crossover, and electric versions of the F-150 pickup and Transit van. A Ford spokesman said the $22 billion includes hybrid vehicles, but the commitment is “overwhelmingly” on EVs. U.S. rival General Motors Co has said it will spend $27 billion by 2023 on electric and autonomous vehicles, a total that does not include hybrids. It said it plans to offer 30 EVs globally by 2025 and is targeting topping annual sales of 1 million EVs in the United States and China by 2025. Asked whether Ford would match GM’s announcement that it aspires to stop selling gasoline-powered light vehicles by 2035, Lawler told reporters Ford is focused on selling high-volume EVs now, a possible reference to GM’s initial EV product launches being lower-volume, higher priced models. For 2020, Ford reported a net loss of $1.3 billion. It had previously said it expected a full-year profit of between $600 million and $1.1 billion. Ford had a loss in the fourth quarter of $2.8 billion, or 70 cents a share, compared with a loss of $1.7 billion, or 42 cents a share, a year earlier. The quarter included several previously disclosed charges related to a recall, remeasurement of pensions and the closure of the company’s Brazilian manufacturing operations. Excluding the charges, Ford’s operating profit was 34 cents a share, easily topping the 7-cent loss analysts polled by Refinitiv had expected. The Dearborn, Michigan-based company projected operating earnings would climb to $8 billion to $9 billion in 2021, compared with $2.8 billion last year. Credit Suisse analyst Dan Levy said in a research note the forecast was above Wall Street consensus expectations for $6.9 billion.

The No. 2 U.S. automaker also said the global semiconductor chip shortage could lead to a 10% to 20% loss in first-quarter production, resulting in a potential hit to operating earnings of $1 billion to $2.5 billion. But its shares gained 1.5% in after-hours trading as the fourth-quarter operating results and 2021 profit forecast were above Wall Street's expectations. read more ""If EVs continue to quickly gain favor, especially with commercial customers, we want to be clear that we will not cede ground to anyone,"" Chief Financial Officer John Lawler told reporters on a conference call. Ford said it was ""doubling down"" on connected electric vehicles and said it will invest $22 billion in electrification through 2025, nearly twice what it had previously committed to EVs. Ford also said it would invest $7 billion in self-driving, or autonomous, technology development over 10 years through 2025 – $5 billion of that from 2021 forward. ""We are accelerating all our plans,"" Chief Executive Jim Farley said, including increasing battery capacity and adding more electric vehicles in its future portfolio. He said on a conference call with analysts that the $22 billion investment does not include potential investment in battery production, whether through at Ford itself or via a joint venture. He added that Ford will have more announcements soon around its EV partnerships. Farley told Reuters last fall Ford was considering making its own battery cells as sales volumes of electric vehicles rise globally. Ford previously committed to invest $11.5 billion in electrification, including gasoline-electric hybrid vehicles, through 2022. That included the launch of the Mustang Mach-E EV crossover, and electric versions of the F-150 pickup and Transit van. A Ford spokesman said the $22 billion includes hybrid vehicles, but the commitment is ""overwhelmingly"" on EVs. U.S. rival General Motors Co (GM.N) has said it will spend $27 billion by 2023 on electric and autonomous vehicles, a total that does not include hybrids. It said it plans to offer 30 EVs globally by 2025 and is targeting topping annual sales of 1 million EVs in the United States and China by 2025. Asked whether Ford would match GM's announcement that it aspires to stop selling gasoline-powered light vehicles by 2035, Lawler told reporters Ford is focused on selling high-volume EVs now, a possible reference to GM's initial EV product launches being lower-volume, higher priced models. read more For 2020, Ford reported a net loss of $1.3 billion. It had previously said it expected a full-year profit of between $600 million and $1.1 billion. Ford had a loss in the fourth quarter of $2.8 billion, or 70 cents a share, compared with a loss of $1.7 billion, or 42 cents a share, a year earlier. The quarter included several previously disclosed charges related to a recall, remeasurement of pensions and the closure of the company's Brazilian manufacturing operations. Excluding the charges, Ford's operating profit was 34 cents a share, easily topping the 7-cent loss analysts polled by Refinitiv had expected.

0.35180299032542595," Ford cuts output of F-150 pickups due to semiconductor shortage WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Thursday it is cutting shifts at two plants that build its highly profitable flagship F-150 pickup trucks starting next week due to a global shortage of semiconductor chips and warned the issue could result in the loss of 10% to 20% of planned first-quarter production. The No. 2 U.S. automaker said it will run one of three shifts of production at its Dearborn Truck Plant the week of Feb. 8, while the truck portion of its Kansas City Assembly Plant will run two of three shifts of production during that week. Both are expected to return to three shifts the following week. Ford Chief Financial Officer John Lawler said the production losses stemming from the semiconductor shortage could lower Ford’s adjusted earnings by $1 billion to $2.5 billion. Lawler said moving forward Ford will continue to prioritize and allocate chips to the highest-margin vehicles when it can. “It’s going to be a logistic effort to do that,” he said. Ford declined to say what part or supplier were involved or how much volume would be lost. Global automakers have been caught off guard by the shortage of crucial semiconductors, used for everything from computer management of engines to driver-assistance features such as emergency braking. Other automakers hit by the shortage include General Motors Co, Volkswagen AG, Toyota Motor Corp, Nissan Motor Co and Subaru Corp. Up to now, automakers have largely focused on cutting production of less profitable vehicles as they manage through the shortage, but Ford cutting output of its high-profit trucks will raise concerns the impact is spreading. Ford spokeswoman Kelli Felker declined to address why the F-150 had been affected, but the Dearborn, Michigan-based company may discuss the matter further later on Thursday. Felker said the automaker was “working closely with suppliers to address potential production constraints tied to the global semiconductor shortage and working to prioritize key vehicle lines for production.” Ford has previously cut other production because of the issue. Also on Thursday, union sources told Reuters that automaker Stellantis will slow production at its Melfi plant in Italy next week due to a shortage of microchips and other parts and will put over 7,000 workers on furlough. Mazda Motor Corp said it expected a production cut of 7,000 vehicles this month as a result. On Wednesday, GM said it would cut production at four of its plants due to the chip shortage. On Tuesday, a group of 15 U.S. senators including Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Republican John Cornyn urged the White House to work with Congress to address the global semiconductor shortage hitting auto manufacturing."
0.35180299032542595," Ford, Stellantis production cuts raise concerns chip shortage impact could worsen (Reuters) - Production cuts by automakers Ford Motor Co and Stellantis NV due to the global semiconductor chip shortage and warnings from suppliers Robert Bosch and German chip maker Infineon on Thursday have raised concerns the problem will only get worse this year for the industry. Ford said it is cutting shifts at two plants that build its highly profitable and top-selling F-150 pickup trucks next week. Meanwhile, union sources told Reuters Stellantis would slow production at its Melfi, Italy, plant next week and furlough 7,000 workers. Global automakers have been caught off guard by the shortage of crucial semiconductors, used for everything for computer management of engines for better fuel economy to driver-assistance features such as emergency braking, highlighting the need to cut dependency on Asian manufacturers. Automakers have largely curtailed production of less profitable vehicles as they manage the shortage, but Ford cutting output of its high-profit trucks will raise fears the impact is spreading. Bosch and Infineon warned that more production headaches could lie ahead as the chip shortage complicates the recovery from last year’s pandemic-related shutdowns. Volvo Cars also said that while it had so far avoided the chip shortages that have curtailed production at a growing number of automakers, there was still a risk it could be hit. During a presentation of its 2020 annual results, Stuttgart-based car parts supplier Bosch said the ongoing COVID-19 crisis and the chip shortage would weigh on global automotive production growth in 2021. Around 85 million vehicles will roll off assembly lines around the world this year, more than the 78 million produced in 2020 but still below the 92 million made in 2019, it said. Global automotive production hit a high of 98 million vehicles in 2017. “We are quite positive,” Bosch Chief Executive Volkmar Denner said, but he added “we still have a long way to go to catch up”. Bosch said it had not been left unscathed by what it called a bottleneck in the global chip market. U.S. automaker General Motors Co <GM.N > said on Wednesday it would cut production next week, joining other automakers that have been hit, including Volkswagen AG, Subaru Corp, Toyota Motor Corp and Nissan Motor Co. Infineon said it was facing challenges in meeting auto industry demand for microcontrollers due to capacity constraints at the contract manufacturers it relies on. “Semiconductor shortages are being felt in the overall automotive supply chain,” Chief Executive Reinhard Ploss said after Infineon reported quarterly results. Volvo Cars CEO Hakan Samuelsson told Reuters his company, which is owned by China’s Geely Holding, could be affected soon. “There is of course a big risk that it could come here during the first quarter,” Samuelsson said. “But it is very hard to forecast.” Europe needs to stump up cash to boost its chip industry, a board member of the continent’s largest carmaker Volkswagen said, highlighting the dependence on foreign players. On Tuesday, a group of 15 U.S. senators urged the White House to work with Congress to address the global semiconductor shortage hitting auto manufacturing."
0.35180299032542595," Ford Motor terminates electric vehicle plans with China's Zotye SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Ford Motor has decided to terminate plans to launch electric vehicle joint ventures with China’s Zotye Automobile, the U.S. auto giant said on Thursday. It said that China’s electric vehicle industry and government policies had undergone major changes since the agreements were signed in 2017 and 2018, prompting Ford’s decision. Ford didn’t specify which changes triggered its move. Last week, Ford said its China joint venture with Chongqing Changan Automobile Co would start making all-electric Mustang Mach-E vehicles. In a statement on Thursday, Ford said it would pursue a more “flexible business model in China” that would see it utilise its existing operations in the country and elsewhere, and build related business centres. Zotye did not immediately respond to a request for comment. In 2017, during a visit by former U.S. President Donald Trump to China, Ford and Zotye said that they would invest a combined $756 million to set up a 50-50 joint venture in China to build small electric passenger vehicles. A year later, the two companies said they had signed a memorandum of understanding for another venture that would make electric vehicles for ride-hailing fleets. EV makers from home-grown Nio Inc to U.S. leader Tesla Inc have been expanding manufacturing capacity in the world’s largest auto market, where the government is heavily promoting greener vehicles as a means of reducing chronic air pollution. Sales of electric, plug-in hybrid and hydrogen-powered vehicles in China are forecast to rise to 20% of new car sales by 2025 from just 5% now, the State Council said in November."
0.35180299032542595," Ford's forecast in focus as it wraps up year with quarterly loss (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co’s investors are likely to brush aside the company’s quarterly loss on Thursday and focus on its 2021 forecast and production target for the revamped F-150 pickup truck, a consistent bestseller in the U.S. automobile market. The No. 2 U.S. automaker needs to strengthen the inventory of F-150 pickup trucks to bolster its profits for the year. The company had previously said production of the F-150 would take a hit in the fourth quarter as it ramped up production of the new version. Chief Executive Officer Jim Farley, who took over the helm in October, has promised to move more capital to the automaker’s high-growth areas, such as the F-Series pickup truck and its commercial business. “We expect soft fourth-quarter results driven primarily by F-series downtime. Ford could provide better than expected 2021 outlook, benefiting from new F-150, Bronco, Mach-E launches; better warranty performance, and large restructuring savings from South America,” Deutsche Bank auto analyst Emmanuel Rosner said. Ford’s three launches - the redesigned F-150 pickup, electric Mustang Mach-E and the revived Bronco sport-utility vehicle - are considered a make or break for the automaker. The F-Series truck has been around since 1948, while the F-150 debuted in 1975. Profits from the new F-150 is key to paying back the billions of dollars Ford has borrowed to ride out the economic shock from the coronavirus pandemic. The company also needs to reduce its warranty repair costs - the primary reason why the Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker’ s financial performance in North America has lagged that of its archrival, General Motors Co.

7.090239410681412," Ford to invest $1 billion to upgrade South Africa operations JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co will invest $1.05 billion in its South African manufacturing operations, including upgrades to expand production of its Ranger pickup truck, the U.S. automaker said on Tuesday. The investments aim to increase Ford’s installed capacity in South Africa from 168,000 to 200,000 vehicles, said Andrea Cavallaro, operations director of Ford’s International Market Group. “It’s the biggest investment in Ford’s 97-year history in South Africa and one of the largest ever in the local automotive industry,” he told an announcement event. Ford joins global carmakers including Volkswagen, Toyota and Nissan in ramping up production in Africa, viewed by the industry as a large, untapped market for new car sales. Around a third of Ford’s local production is sold in South Africa and other sub-Saharan African countries, with the rest exported elsewhere. Ford’s South African investment includes $683 million for technology upgrades and new facilities at its plant in Silverton, a suburb of the administrative capital Pretoria, and $365 million to upgrade tooling at major supplier factories. The plant will also manufacture Volkswagen pickup trucks as part of the Ford-VW alliance. The expanded production will create 1,200 jobs with Ford in South Africa, increasing the local workforce to 5,500 employees, while adding an estimated 10,000 new jobs across the carmaker’s supplier network. Ford also aims to make the Silverton plant entirely energy self-sufficient and carbon neutral by 2024, Cavallaro said. South Africa has big ambitions for its automotive sector, putting it at the heart of attempts to revive economic growth and reduce unemployment via industrialisation. Speaking at Ford’s announcement, South African President Cyril Ramaphosa said the company had already helped to bring 12 automotive component suppliers to the country. “Ford Motor Company is like a beautiful flower and it has attracted all these wonderful bees that keep coming here,” he said. The government’s plan targets a more than doubling of the industry’s annual production to 1.4 million vehicles by 2035 and raising the proportion of auto components made locally to 60% from 39%, supported by investment and tax incentives. The goals have been dealt a blow by the COVID-19 pandemic, however, with both local sales and exports down by around 30% last year."

3.645833333333333," Ford to recall 3 million vehicles for air bags at $610 million cost WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Thursday it will recall 3 million vehicles for air bag inflators that could rupture, at a cost of $610 million. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on Tuesday ordered Ford to issue the recall for driver-side air bag inflators, rejecting the automaker’s 2017 petition to avoid it. The defect, which in rare instances leads to air bag inflators rupturing and sending potentially deadly metal fragments flying, prompted the largest automotive recall in U.S. history of more than 67 million inflators. Worldwide, about 100 million inflators installed by 19 major automakers have been recalled. The recall includes 2.7 million U.S. vehicles. Ford will include the cost in fourth-quarter results. The vehicles were previously recalled for passenger-side inflators. “We believe our extensive data demonstrated that a safety recall was not warranted for the driver-side airbag. However, we respect NHTSA’s decision and will issue a recall,” Ford said. NHTSA also required Mazda Motor Corp to recall 5,800 air bag inflators in 2007–2009 B-Series vehicles. Takata inflators have resulted in at least 400 injuries and 27 deaths worldwide - including 18 U.S. fatalities with two in previously recalled 2006 Ford Ranger trucks. The Ford vehicles being recalled include various 2006-2012 model-year Ranger, Fusion, Edge, Lincoln Zephyr/MKZ, Mercury Milan and Lincoln MKX vehicles. In November, NHTSA rejected a petition filed by General Motors Co to avoid recalling 5.9 million U.S. vehicles with Takata air bags. GM said the callback covered 7 million vehicles worldwide and would cost $1.2 billion. Ford separately disclosed on Thursday it expects to record a pretax remeasurement loss of $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter related to pension and other post-employment benefits plans, driven by lower discount rates. Ford said the remeasurement loss is expected to reduce net income by about $1.2 billion, but did not change expectations for 2021 pension contributions."

5.432780847145487," U.S. agency orders Ford to recall 3 million vehicles over air bags WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co must recall 3 million vehicles with potentially defective driver-side Takata air bags, the U.S. auto safety regulator said on Tuesday, rejecting a bid by the second-largest U.S. automaker to avoid a recall. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said it was denying petitions filed by Ford and Mazda Motor Corp in 2017 seeking to avoid recalling vehicles with potentially dangerous inflators. The decision also will require Mazda to recall and repair driver air bags in approximately 5,800 vehicles. The recalls will cover various vehicles from the 2006 through 2012 model years. The defect, which leads in rare instances to air bag inflators rupturing and sending potentially deadly metal fragments flying - especially after long-term exposure to high humidity - prompted the largest automotive recall in U.S. history of more than 67 million inflators. Worldwide, about 100 million inflators installed by 19 major automakers have been recalled. The NHTSA said the “evidence makes clear that these inflators pose a significant safety risk.” Earlier this month, the auto safety agency said at least 17 million vehicles with Takata air bags remain unrepaired. Takata inflators have resulted in the deaths of at least 27 people worldwide and 18 in the United States, and over 400 reported injuries, Ford said on Tuesday that the vehicles the NHTSA was ordering be recalled were subject to an earlier Takata recall for the passenger-side airbag, but did not comment further. Mazda did not immediately comment. The recall will apply to various Ford Ranger, Fusion, Edge, Lincoln Zephyr/MKZ, Mercury Milan and Lincoln MKX vehicles, along with Mazda 2007–2009 model year B-Series vehicles. The Mazda vehicles were designed by Ford, built on the same platform, and used the same air bag inflators as the Ranger trucks. The regulator said Ford must within 30 days “submit to NHTSA a proposed schedule for the notification of vehicle owners and the launch of a remedy.” Two people died in Takata air bag ruptures in previously recalled 2006 Ford Ranger vehicles with the most recent death in 2017. In November, the NHTSA said it was rejecting a petition filed by General Motors Co to avoid the recall of 5.9 million U.S. vehicles with Takata air bags. In November the agency said GM must recall the 2007-2014 model-year trucks and SUVs. GM estimated in securities filings that it would cost $1.2 billion if it were required to replace air bag inflators it had sought to avoid fixing and said it would recall 7 million vehicles worldwide."

The recall will apply to various Ford Ranger, Fusion, Edge, Lincoln Zephyr/MKZ, Mercury Milan and Lincoln MKX vehicles, along with Mazda 2007–2009 model year B-Series vehicles. The Mazda vehicles were designed by Ford, built on the same platform, and used the same air bag inflators as the Ranger trucks. The regulator said Ford must within 30 days ""submit to NHTSA a proposed schedule for the notification of vehicle owners and the launch of a remedy."" Two people died in Takata air bag ruptures in previously recalled 2006 Ford Ranger vehicles with the most recent death in 2017. In November, the NHTSA said it was rejecting a petition filed by General Motors Co (GM.N) to avoid the recall of 5.9 million U.S. vehicles with Takata air bags. In November the agency said GM must recall the 2007-2014 model-year trucks and SUVs. GM estimated in securities filings that it would cost $1.2 billion if it were required to replace air bag inflators it had sought to avoid fixing and said it would recall 7 million vehicles worldwide.

26.584867075664636," Ford plant closures to aid overseas profitability: J.P. Morgan (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co’s decision to close three plants in Brazil will cut its losses and allow it to focus on boosting profitability in its underperforming international segment, J.P. Morgan analysts said on Tuesday. The United States’ No. 2 automaker on Monday said it would take pretax charges of about $4.1 billion to close the Brazilian plants, under used for a while due to pandemic-related restrictions, affecting 5,000 jobs. Shares of the company gained 3% following the announcement on Monday afternoon and were roughly steady in premarket trading on Tuesday at $9.31. Ford said the move was part of a previously announced $11 billion global restructuring, of which it has already taken a charge of $4.2 billion in the third quarter of 2020. It expects to book another $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter and about $1.6 billion in 2021. J.P. Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman said in a note the move came at a time when investors had been complaining of the absence of a path to profitability for the South American businesses. “We expect the move to quickly reduce losses in its South American operations, for which we now model a breakeven result in 2020 compared with a loss of $300 million prior.” The brokerage raised its price target for Ford’s stock by 10% to $11. Credit Suisse analysts also said the plant closures supported Ford’s road to improved margins and that a reduced footprint made sense."

Ford has yet to tell the truth, right? They want subsidies,” Bolsonaro said during a talk with supporters recorded on video and published on social media. Bolsonaro criticized the decision of past administrations to subsidize the industry with taxpayer money and lamented the loss of 5,000 jobs in the country. Ford did not immediately reply to a request for comment on Bolsonaro’s remarks. On Monday, Ford said it would close its plants in Brazil this year, two of them immediately, and take pretax charges of about $4.1 billion as the COVID-19 pandemic amplified the company’s underutilization of its manufacturing capacity.

26.584867075664636," Ford to close Brazil manufacturing operations, take $4.1 billion in charges DETROIT/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Monday it will close its three plants in Brazil this year and take pretax charges of about $4.1 billion as the COVID-19 pandemic amplified the company’s under use of its manufacturing capacity. Production will cease immediately at Ford’s plants in Camaçari and Taubaté, with some parts production continuing for a few months to support inventories for aftermarket sales. The Troller plant in Belo Horizonte, Brazil, will continue to operate until the fourth quarter. Ford officials said the action was part of the $11 billion global restructuring previously forecast by the U.S. automaker, of which it had accounted for $4.2 billion through the third quarter of 2020. Ford shares closed up more than 3%. The plant closures affect about 5,000 employees, mostly in Brazil, Ford spokesman T.R. Reid said on a conference call with reporters. Industry vehicle sales fell 26% in Brazil last year and are not expected to rebound to 2019 levels until 2023 with an emphasis on less profitable fleet sales, Ford said. “We know these are very difficult, but necessary, actions to create a healthy and sustainable business,” Ford Chief Executive Jim Farley said in a statement. “We are moving to a lean, asset-light business model by ceasing production in Brazil.” Ford officials said the plant closures are part of the company’s strategy to achieve 8% global operating margins. Ford, which has operated in Brazil for more than a century, has begun discussions with its unions and others about the layoffs. Brazil’s Economy Ministry lamented Ford’s decision to end production in the country and said it reinforced the need for reforms to improve the business climate. In Camaçari, in northeastern Brazil, the union called an emergency meeting at the factory gates at the first shift on Tuesday to take a stance on the loss of 4,059 jobs. “This very hard blow took us by surprise. We never imagined that Ford could close its factories in Brazil,” said union leader Julio Bonfim in a video message to the workers. The closures marked another retreat by Ford in a developing market after the Dearborn, Michigan-based company last month called off its auto joint venture with India’s Mahindra and Mahindra Ltd. As a result of the plant closures, Ford will end sales in South America of EcoSport SUV, Ka subcompact car and T4 SUV once inventories are sold. Ford retains a plant in Argentina and another in Uruguay. Ford said it will maintain its product development center in Bahia, its proving ground in Tatuí, São Paulo, and its regional headquarters in São Paulo. Of the $4.1 billion in charges, Ford said it expects to record about $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020 and about $1.6 billion in 2021.

38.45278725824802," Mahindra to focus on SUVs, electric after ending Ford JV talks NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd will focus on developing its core portfolio of sport-utility vehicles (SUVs) and their electric version, a senior executive said on Friday after the company ended joint venture talks with Ford Motor Co. Anish Shah, the deputy managing director, said Mahindra will focus mainly on large SUVs for its core India market in the short term and move to electric in the medium term, as it charts a new strategy for its automotive business. “We are going back to our core,” Shah, who will take over as managing director from April, told Reuters. “We are going to look ahead at how we can accelerate our investment in electric and really start moving to the new age. We clearly hold the ambition to be a global brand and there again the electric journey is an important one,” Shah said. Mahindra’s high-end electric vehicle Pininfarina Battista is a starting point, Shah said, adding that the automaker would look at developing more electric platforms in India to build SUVs for the local and export markets. Mahindra and Ford late on Thursday called off their automotive joint venture due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which prompted them to reassess their capital allocation priorities. The two companies had plans to jointly develop vehicles for manufacture in India for local sales and export to dozens of emerging markets under the Ford badge. However, Mahindra was not convinced the venture would generate returns needed to justify the higher investment it would have to make in a post-pandemic world. Shah told reporters Mahindra had initially planned to invest about 30 billion rupees ($410.68 million) in the venture, half of which would have been equity. Now, Mahindra plans to invest the money in electric vehicles, he said, adding it is open to collaborating with Ford in the future, including in EVs. The review is part of a broader restructuring at Mahindra under which the company is exiting several loss-making businesses, including its South Korean unit Ssangyong Motor, to focus on profits and cash flow. Mahindra said on Friday it is close to agreeing a deal with a potential investor for its majority stake in Ssangyong, which has been placed in receivership. Its total investment in the SUV-maker is $264 million and the extent of the write-off would depend on what deal is agreed, Shah said. The automaker last year also pulled the plug on its U.S. electric scooter unit GenZe and aviation business GippsAero. Its other global subsidiaries include Peugeot Motorcycles. Mahindra sold close to 190,000 passenger vehicles in India in the last fiscal year ended March 31, giving it close to 7% share of the market, industry data shows."

Keyvone Lee had 95 yards on 17 carries while Devyn Ford rushed 11 times for 65 yards and one touchdown for Penn State (2-5, 2-5 Big Ten), which has won two straight following the first 0-5 start in program history. Will Levis had 65 yards on 17 carries and Clifford finished 15-of-22 passing for 133 yards. Noah Vedral was 17-of-30 passing for 113 yards and one touchdown for Rutgers (2-5, 2-5), which has lost five of its last six. Vedral also rushed for 56 yards, and Bo Melton had seven catches for 38 yards and one touchdown. Penn State had a 14-2 edge in first downs in the first half, during which it outgained Rutgers 229-43. The Nittany Lions turned a fourth-down defensive stand -- the Scarlet Knights went for it on fourth-and-1 from their 45-yard-line but Johnny Langan was tackled for no gain -- into a five-play drive that ended with Clifford’s 29-yard touchdown pass to Parker Washington. Following a three-and-out by Rutgers, the Nittany Lions marched 74 yards in 11 plays before Jake Pinegar booted a 30-yard field goal with 11:37 left in the second quarter.

27.73019271948608," Ford delays Bronco SUV launch due to coronavirus issues at suppliers DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co is delaying the launch of its Bronco SUV next year to the summer from the initial spring target due to coronavirus-related issues with its suppliers, a company spokesman said on Friday. “Deliveries will begin the summer rather than the spring. That’s being driven by COVID-related challenges some of our suppliers are experiencing,” Ford spokesman Said Deep said. The suppliers, which Ford did not identify, have had development work for tooling delayed by the pandemic, Deep said. Asked whether the launch could face further delays, Deep said Ford was monitoring the outbreak closely. The pandemic caused the U.S. auto industry to shutter plants for two months earlier in the year, but since production restarted automakers have been largely successful in preventing the spread of the virus within their facilities. Ford still expects to begin building the Bronco at its Michigan Assembly Plant in Wayne, Michigan in the spring, Deep said. The Dearborn, Michigan-based company is already shipping the smaller Bronco Sport, which is built in Mexico. Customers’ ability to place orders for the Bronco also has been delayed from Dec. 7 to mid-January, Deep said. Earlier on Friday, industry officials said a shortage of chips used in auto manufacturing could disrupt vehicle production in China well into next year. Deep said Ford’s issues were not related."

29.841269841269845," Ford orders 12 ultra-cold freezers to distribute COVID-19 vaccines to employees DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Tuesday it has ordered a dozen ultra-cold freezers that can safely store Pfizer Inc’s COVID-19 vaccine, a move aimed at ensuring the U.S. automaker’s workers have access to vaccines when they are rolled out nationally. Ford’s purchase mirrors efforts by U.S. states and cities to buy equipment to store millions of doses of Pfizer’s vaccine at temperatures of minus 70 Celsius (minus 94 Fahrenheit), significantly below the standard for vaccines of 2-8 C (36-46 F). Health care providers and states are preparing for a new type of vaccines by Pfizer and Moderna Inc that require lower temperatures for storage. “We’re doing this so that we can make the vaccine available to our employees on a voluntary basis,” Ford spokeswoman Kelli Felker said. Details of how Ford will use the freezers, which are expected to be delivered by year end, are still being worked out, she said. Ford screens its workers in-plant and, if COVID-19 testing is required, has partnerships with local healthcare providers. Assembly workers are considered essential in most states, but not at the top of the list for vaccines, which are expected to be distributed first to healthcare workers and nursing home residents. Automakers have been largely able to avoid spread of the virus among hourly workers in their assembly plants after a two-month shutdown earlier in the year, but COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations are spiking in the United States, especially in the Midwest. Felker did not know which company is supplying Ford with the freezers. Major manufacturers include Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc, PHC Corp of North America, Luxembourg’s B Medical Systems, Stirling Ultracold and Helmer Scientific. Some specialty freezer makers have warned of months-long waits for units. Ford, which decided to buy the freezers on its own and is not working with other companies or states, did not disclose how much it spent, but the specialized freezers required by Pfizer’s vaccine can cost $5,000 to $15,000 apiece, according to industry officials. General Motors Co said it had not purchased freezers at this time. “We are taking steps to be prepared to make vaccines available to our employees when the time is right and vaccines are available to us,” GM spokesman Patrick Morrissey said. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles said it is studying the most effective approach to distributing vaccines to employees when they become available. Officials at Toyota Motor Corp, and the United Auto Workers union, which represents most U.S. hourly workers at the Detroit automakers, did not have an immediate comment. A Michigan Department of Health spokeswoman said the agency was not aware of companies seeking to buy these freezers. Lynn Sutfin said state officials surveyed healthcare providers and health departments and are aware of about 50 ultra-cold freezers in Michigan. State officials also have purchased another nine, she said."

39.46406820950059," Ford targets leading share in EV commercial market that it has with gas engines DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co is aiming to grab a significant share of the emerging electric vehicle market with products like the new E-Transit cargo van to match the hold it already has over the traditional internal combustion engine market. The company unveils its new E-Transit commercial van on Thursday during a virtual webcast. Chief Executive Jim Farley has made clear Ford is betting connected, electric commercial vehicles, can generate lucrative, recurring profits despite a growing field of electric competitors. Ford already dominates the U.S. and European markets for gasoline-powered commercial vehicles with shares of 40% and almost 15%, respectively. “We deserve the same share in EVs that we have in ICE and we think we’re well positioned to get there,” Ted Cannis, head of Ford’s North American commercial vehicle business, said in a telephone interview ahead of the online introduction. Farley said Ford expects global demand for electric vans will grow by more than 1.1 million vehicles by 2030 and while startups like Rivian and Arrival have contracts to build electric vans for Amazon.com Inc and UPS, respectively, none can match Ford’s product or service options, including a deep list of service centers and upfitters. “Workhorse or Arrival or Rivian, they don’t have the breadth of product,” Cannis said. Ford has invested in Rivian, but the E-Transit is not related to the startup’s van. The E-Transit comes in eight configurations, including three roof heights and three lengths, as well as in cargo, cutaway and chassis cab versions. The low-roof cargo van version will have an EV driving range of 126 miles. The new van, which includes a standard 12-inch touchscreen and the ability to do over-the-air software updates, will have a starting price of almost $45,000, about $10,000 more than the gas-powered version, and comes with an 8-year, 100,000 electric vehicle component warranty. Others planning EVs for the commercial van segment include Germany’s Daimler AG, General Motors Co and startups Xos Trucks and Bollinger Motors. Cannis did not disclose what sales volumes Ford is planning for E-Transit, but Bill Rinna, director of Americas vehicle forecasts at LMC Automotive said the Dearborn, Michigan, automaker is expected to build 20,000-25,000 a year in North America. Two of three electric vehicles Ford has announced as part of an $11.5 billion investment in electrification through 2022 are aimed at commercial customers - the E-Transit and an electric F-150 pickup, coming in mid-2022. Ford’s Mustang Mach-E electric SUV, arriving later this year, represents a low-volume challenger to electric luxury vehicle market leader Tesla Inc.. Regulators in Europe and some U.S. cities are stepping up pressure on businesses to replace diesel or gasoline-fueled delivery vans with electric models to reduce pollution. Ford said Tuesday it will invest $100 million and hire 150 workers to build the E-Transit at its plant near Kansas City, Missouri."
40.334128878281604," Ford to add jobs to boost output of electric F-150, add electric van DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co F.N said on Tuesday it plans to hire 350 more U.S. workers to expand production capacity for its electric F-150 pickup truck in Michigan and add assembly of electric commercial vans at a plant near Kansas City, Missouri. The company said it also will add a second vehicle at the Mexican factory that is already set to build the Mustang Mach-E electric sport utility vehicle. Ford did not disclose how many people would be hired to build the additional vehicle in Mexico, which would “share a similar electrifed platform” as the Mach-E. Ford will invest $150 million to add production of electric vehicle motors and transaxles at a transmission factory in suburban Detroit, retaining 225 jobs. The automaker’s latest electric vehicle investments are part of an $11.5 billion plan mapped out through 2022. Ford has promised the United Auto Workers union that it will invest $6 billion in U.S. factories to build electric vehicles. Ford will increase production capacity for an electric version of its F-150 large pickup by 50% from its original plans, adding another 200 permanent jobs at a complex near its headquarters in Dearborn, Mich. Those jobs would be on top of 300 jobs previously promised for the electric F-150 line. The electric F-150, scheduled to go on sale in 2022, will compete with electric pickups planned by Tesla Inc TSLA.O, General Motors Co GM.N, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCHA.MI and several startup companies, in a segment that was not on most automakers' product plans just a few years ago. Kumar Galhotra, president of Ford’s Americas and International Markets groups, said the decision to boost electric F-150 output was taken after the truck’s debut in June. Based on the response to the work-oriented electric truck from government agencies, commercial fleets and individual buyers, “we started working on a substantial increase,” Galhotra said in an interview. Galhotra did not say how many electric F-150s Ford will be able to build. Ford will invest $100 million and hire 150 workers to build electric versions of its Transit commercial van, scheduled to go on sale in 2022. The electric Transit will enter a field that is racing from virtually non-existent to crowded as established automakers and startups compete to respond to demand from e-commerce delivery companies for electrically driven and digitally connected vehicles."

47.753530166880616," Ford's Chinese ventures October sales jump as SUVs, vans lead demand recovery SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co's F.N Chinese ventures reported higher vehicle sales for October from a year earlier, as strong demand for sport-utility vehicles (SUVs) and vans continued to support its recovery in the world's biggest auto market. The Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker's Chongqing-based venture with Changan 000625.SZ said on Thursday it sold 26,305 vehicles last month, a 43% jump year-on-year. Jiangling Motors Corp (JMC) 000550.SZ, in which Ford owns a stake, said in a filing earlier this week it sold 34,008 vehicles last month, up 26% on year. Overall auto sales are expected to grow 11.4% on year in October. Changan-Ford sells SUV models including Escape, Edge and Explorer. JMC sells Ford-branded SUVs and vans as well as JMC-branded commercial vehicles. After two quarters of growth, Ford’s China head Anning Chen said the firm now hopes that sales would continue to grow in the remaining months of this year. He, however, declined to offer a detailed sales forecast for the fourth quarter or the full year. Chen, on the sidelines of the China International Import Expo, an annual import show in Shanghai, told Reuters that the company is considering to bring more SUV models and vehicles in China, with intelligent functions to connect with surrounding infrastructure as part of the three-year product plan it announced last year. Chen said Ford is researching feasibility of making Ford-branded pickup truck in the country but it is yet to lay out a clear plan."

36.22250970245794," Ford eyes first-year sales of 100,000 vehicles with hands-free driving system (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co F.N said on Friday it expects to sell 100,000 cars and trucks equipped with the company's new hands-free driving system in the first full year of availability. The catch is, only the system hardware will be installed. The software will not be ready for nearly another year, Ford said. The automaker’s Active Drive Assist will be offered first on the redesigned F-150 pickup and the new Mustang Mach-E electric SUV, both of which go on sale later this year. However, the feature will not be activated until the third quarter of 2021, the company said. Customers can order a Mach-E or an F-150 with the Co-Pilot360 advanced driver assistance package, which includes the hardware for Active Drive Assist. That feature will be switched on via a wireless over-the-air update when the software is finalized next year, Ford said. Active Drive Assist will be standard on selected high-end models and available as an option on others, priced from around $1,500. Consumer Reports earlier this week released results of its test of 17 vehicles equipped with active driving assistance systems, including a Tesla TSLA.O Model Y -- a head-to-head competitor to the Mustang Mach-E -- with Autopilot. The Model Y finished ""a distant second"" in the testing to a Cadillac CT6 fitted with General Motors Co's GM.N Super Cruise system."
33.29113924050632," Ford sees full-year pretax profit, posts stronger than expected quarterly earnings DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co F.N on Wednesday posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit on strong U.S. demand for pickups and SUVs, and forecast a full-year pretax profit instead of a loss, boosting shares in after-hours trading. Ford CEO Jim Farley, who took over on Oct. 1, is tasked with completing the No. 2 U.S. automaker’s $11 billion restructuring begun under his predecessor, Jim Hackett, and has promised greater urgency. He has also said he is keen to expand Ford’s operations into related technology fields, including software, data, fleet management and electric vehicle charging. Ford reported net income in the third quarter of $2.4 billion, or 60 cents a share, compared with $400 million, or 11 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding items, Ford’s profit was $3.6 billion, or 65 cents a share, topping the 19 cents analysts polled by Refinitiv had expected. The company said it now anticipates better-than-expected fourth-quarter results, as well as a full-year pretax profit of between $600 million and $1.1 billion. Ford said in July that it expected a pretax profit of between $500 million and $1.5 billion in the third quarter and a loss for the fourth quarter as well as for the full year. In a conference call on Wednesday, Farley said: “We haven’t fixed the issues that have held us back in our automotive business.” But he added that his leadership team has “a clear turnaround plan.” The automaker fully repaid $15 billion in revolving credit loans and ended the quarter with nearly $30 billion in cash and more than $45 billion of liquidity. The company’s adjusted EBIT margin in the quarter was 9.7%, with a full-year target of 8%. Ford’s net margin in the period was 6.4%. Ford began building the redesigned F-150 and the new Mustang Mach-E and Bronco Sport this month. The new full-size truck goes on sale next month, and along with the commercial business is key to Ford’s growth strategy. [nL4N2GE34O] [nL1N2FL0MR] Farley said electric vehicles, including battery-powered variants of the F-150 pickup and Transit van, were “fundamental” to the company’s future, including the Lincoln line and Ford’s commercial vehicle business. Ford shares were up 3.8% at $8.00 in extended trading, paring gains from an initial rise of 7% after hours. Credit Suisse analyst Dan Levy in an earnings note said, “We expect the stock to outperform near-term; indeed, we believe Jim Farley will drive incremental urgency and accountability at Ford.” “We saw much higher demand than we expected,” Chief Financial Officer John Lawler told reporters on the conference call. “We also saw higher net pricing, particularly in North America.”"

The left-hander led the American League in wins three times and captured the 1961 Cy Young Award with a 25-4 record, a 3.21 ERA and 209 strikeouts in 283 innings. “The Yankees are incredibly saddened to learn of (his) passing,” the team said in a statement posted to Twitter. .”.. One of the best lefties to ever toe the rubber. He will be deeply missed.” Major League Baseball commissioner Rob Manfred also released a statement. “Today all of Major League Baseball mourns the loss of Whitey Ford, a New York City native who became a legend for his hometown team,” Manfred said. “Whitey earned his status as the ace of some of the most memorable teams in our sport’s rich history. Beyond the Chairman of the Board’s excellence on the mound, he was a distinguished ambassador for our National Pastime throughout his life. I extend my deepest condolences to Whitey’s family, his friends and admirers throughout our game, and all fans of the Yankees.” Ford, who missed the 1951 and 1952 seasons while serving in the U.S. Army during the Korean War, helped the Yankees win 11 pennants and six World Series titles in 1950, 1953, 1956, 1958, 1961 and 1962.

25.311203319502074," Supreme Court struggles over broad jurisdictional rule in Ford crash cases (Reuters) - During oral arguments Wednesday in a pair of product liability cases against Ford, U.S. Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito rather heatedly described the court’s dilemma in confronting personal jurisdiction in the internet age. The Supreme Court’s seminal ruling on the intersection of personal jurisdiction and due process fairness for defendants was 1945’s International Shoe v. State of Washington, in which the justices held that corporations can be sued in states where they conduct significant business “according to our traditional conception of fair play and substantial justice.” Want more On the Case? Listen to the On the Case podcast. But it’s not 1945 anymore, Justice Alito said, in a nod to other justices’ questions about how the internet has expanded interstate commerce for even the smallest of businesses. (Chief Justice John Roberts, for instance, proposed a hypothetical about whether a duck decoy artisan in Maine who advertised his decoys on the internet could be sued wherever they’re sold.) And in the 1945 International Shoe decision, Justice Alito said, the Supreme Court did not even attempt to discern what due process meant when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted, instead applying its own notion of fair play. So what is today’s court supposed to do, Justice Alito asked Deepak Gupta of Gupta Wessler, who represents two plaintiffs who sued Ford in their home states after they were injured in crashes involving second-hand Ford vehicles. “We could perhaps decide this case within the contours of our existing cases because there’s nothing particularly 21st century about what happened here,” the justice said. “But we’re in a strange situation … The world in 2020 is completely different. You may just say, ‘Well, decide this on the basis of your existing case law and not propose anything grander.’ But if you have a solution to the bigger problems that have been framed by some of the questions, it would be interesting to hear it.” Based on Wednesday’s arguments, that’s the crux of the Supreme Court’s challenge in the Ford cases: There’s no clear path to a grand resolution. Should the court sidestep what Justice Neil Gorsuch called “the difficulties our doctrinal tests have created” to articulate a whole new framework based on an originalist view of due process? Should the justices build on the court’s own precedent to adopt a sweeping new test for personal jurisdiction – even though Gupta and Ford counsel Sean Marotta of Hogan Lovells proposed completely different tests, both purportedly rooted in Supreme Court precedent? Or, alternatively, should the justices rule narrowly to avoid imposing a problematic new test? “I don’t know which way it’s going to go,” said Fordham law professor Howard Erichson. “Maybe this is not the case for redefining personal jurisdiction.” University of Connecticut law professor Alexandra Lahav agreed that the justices seemed to struggle with the consequences of every available path. “They seemed to have difficulty figuring out how much they want a general rule and how much they want to do justice in the individual cases,” she said. Erichson wrote in a pre-argument blog post that Ford was offering the court “an aggressive but superficially plausible reading” of the Supreme Court’s recent precedent restricting jurisdiction. As Marotta explained the proposed test on Wednesday, the court’s precedent in such cases as 2017’s Bristol-Myers v. Superior Court of California and 2014’s Walden v. Fiore lead to the conclusion that to establish specific jurisdiction plaintiffs must show defendant’s conduct within the state where they have sued caused their injuries. It’s “irrelevant,” Marotta said, that Ford marketed, sold and serviced cars in Minnesota and Montana, where it was sued in the cases before the Supreme Court. Ford did not design, manufacture or sell the vehicles involved in the crashes at the heart of the two cases in Minnesota or Montana, Marotta said. (The vehicles in both cases were second-hand so they were not sold by Ford dealers.) Under Ford’s causation test, Marotta said, Montana and Minnesota did not have jurisdiction over claims that the vehicles were defective. Justice Elena Kagan offered the most forceful opposition to Marotta’s proposed test. In the Bristol-Myers case, she pointed out, the Supreme Court said plaintiffs with no connection to California could not participate in a mass tort action filed in California state court. By contrast, Justice Kagan said, the plaintiffs suing Ford lived in, used Ford vehicles and were injured in the states where they sued. Justice Clarence Thomas said Marotta’s proposed test left him “a little confused – how do we get from the Due Process Clause to your proximate cause argument?” Justice Stephen Breyer pointed out that the court’s jurisdictional doctrine is intended to prevent unfairness to defendants who shouldn’t be haled into court at the whim of plaintiffs. Ford, he said, does a lot of business in Minnesota and Montana, and even if it did not sell the exact vehicles involved in the crashes in the two cases within state lines, it sells lots of cars and trucks of the same model. “Since they do a lot of business with the same kinds of cars there, they have to be prepared to defend against this kind of suit,” Justice Breyer said. “So what’s unfair about it?” Plaintiffs’ counsel Gupta said Ford’s proposed test would turn jurisdiction into “an irrelevant scavenger hunt,” introducing complexity and unfairness into what should be a simple regimen. He offered the justices a different test: Plaintiffs must show that a defendant has “purposefully availed” itself of the opportunity to conduct business in a state and that their suit is “related to” the defendant’s conduct in the forum. When Justice Thomas asked Gupta to clarify his definition for “related to,” Gupta said plaintiffs can meet the test by showing that defendants sold the same products at issue in their cases within the state. (Even if Ford did not sell the exact vehicles involved in the Minnesota and Montana cases, in other words, plaintiffs’ claims were related to Ford’s marketing, sale and service of cars and trucks of the exact same make and model.) But the justices posed hypotheticals showing that Gupta’s test has its own complexities. Justice Alito asked if, say, a rebuilt, customized car should fit the definition. Justice Gorsuch homed in on whether the relevant product is the finished car or a part within the vehicle. Justice Breyer wanted to know if Gupta had in mind a standard for how many identical products a defendant would have to sell to meet his standard. In his rebuttal, Ford counsel Marotta highlighted the problems that could arise from the relatedness test, which he said was ungrounded in common law (or even in the records of the Montana and Minnesota cases). “Is a similar product sufficient? Does it have to be the same features that are alleged to be defective in the case?” Marotta said. “And how long does this have to take place? One year of sales, many years of sales? These are the questions that are going to trouble the lower courts for years if you adopt that test.” Of course, as Fordham prof Erichson said, the justices could opt to institute no new test at all, simply deciding on the fact of the Montana and Minnesota cases whether those state supreme courts properly determined that they had jurisdiction. (As Gupta mentioned during Wednesday’s argument, Justices Alito and Breyer actually cautioned against adopting broad jurisdictional rules that might have unintended consequences in their concurrence in J. McIntyre Machinery v. Nicastro. The eight justices who heard Wednesday’s arguments, Erichson predicted, will sorely miss Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg as they grapple with this case. “She would have been the dominant voice,” he said."
23.657474600870827," Ford U.S. auto sales continue recovery on pickup demand (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co F.N on Friday continued to show signs of a recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic as demand for sports utility vehicles and pickup trucks helped boost third-quarter sales in the United States. The U.S. auto sector has climbed back quicker than other industries, but automakers had a hand in that with aggressive incentives like zero-for-84 months financing, payment deferrals and job assurance programs. Ford posted a 5% fall in U.S. auto sales for the third quarter but said a continuing recovery from pandemic-induced lockdowns helped it record better sales compared with the second quarter. The No.2 U.S. automaker, which announces its quarterly sales volumes a day later than the rest of the industry, said it sold 551,796 vehicles in the country in the quarter, down from 580,251 a year earlier. Its sales were, however, up 27.2% when compared with the preceding quarter. “The seasonally adjusted sales pace for September demonstrated yet another sequential improvement for the industry, and a return to near pre-virus levels ... a print 16.4mn is not far off the 17mn level we saw from 2015-19,” Credit Suisse analyst Dan Levy said. “It remains to be seen if this level of sales can be sustained near-term.” Bigger rival General Motors Co GM.N reported a 10% decline in sales on Thursday and said the auto sales have been even more resilient and made a substantial rebound in the third quarter. While overall industry sales in the quarter were down, the trend was positive as demand increased each month, especially among retail consumers for high-profit SUVs and pickup trucks. Sales for its F-Series pickup-truck rose 3.5% in the quarter when compared with a year ago, marking its best pickup sales since 2005, Ford said."
30.22222222222221," Ford's new CEO Farley promises urgency at automaker, shakes up management DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co's F.N new chief executive, Jim Farley, on Thursday promised the U.S. automaker would move with urgency, responding to investor and analyst criticism of the speed at which his predecessor acted. Farley, on his first day as Ford’s 11th CEO, also announced an executive shake-up that included naming a new chief financial officer. Ford’s promise to accelerate its turnaround is not new at a time when it is executing an $11 billion restructuring. Farley was named chief operating officer in February and promised a faster return to strong profits. He was officially tapped to succeed Jim Hackett in August. “During the past three years, under Jim Hackett’s leadership, we have made meaningful progress and opened the door to becoming a vibrant, profitably growing company,” Farley said in a statement on Thursday. “Now it’s time to charge through that door.” Hackett and Ford have been criticized by some on Wall Street for not moving quickly enough on its restructuring. At the end of the second quarter, the Dearborn, Michigan-based company had incurred only $3.9 billion of the projected $11 billion in charges. Farley will face immediate tests in his new role, including ensuring a smooth launch for the highly profitable, top-selling F-150 pickup truck to avoid the costly missteps Ford experienced when it revamped the Ford Explorer SUV. Ford on Thursday reaffirmed its goal for operating margins of 8%, something it identified as a 2020 target before the coronavirus pandemic hit. It did not specify when it would achieve this target. Ford’s operating margin was 4.1% last year, before falling to negative 4.8% in the first half of 2020 due to the coronavirus outbreak. The company also said John Lawler would succeed Tim Stone as CFO. Lawler most recently had been head of Ford Autonomous Vehicles and vice president of mobility partnerships. He also served as president of Ford China for nearly four years. Stone, who will remain with Ford through Oct. 15, accepted a job as COO and CFO with ASAPP Inc, an artificial-intelligence software company. Stone had been in the CFO job only since June 2019. Ford also said it would separate the Lincoln and marketing jobs to put greater focus on both. Joy Falotico, who had held both the Lincoln and global marketing jobs, will focus on Lincoln once a chief marketing officer is named, in a move meant to accelerate the brand’s growth. Farley outlined his objectives during a virtual town hall meeting with Ford’s global team on Thursday, saying the company will allocate capital to its strongest franchises and high-growth opportunities, such as the F-Series pickup truck and its commercial business. It also will add more affordable vehicles to its global lineup, build electric vehicles at scale and stand up new autonomous-enabled businesses, he said. Decision making will be pushed down to the regional level. Credit Suisse analyst Dan Levy welcomed Farley’s urgency and Lawler’s ascension, and said investors will expect increased disclosure under the new management team. Ford has moved to cut costs globally, including earlier this month when it said it would target cutting 1,400 U.S. salaried jobs by year end. Last year, Ford cut 7,000 salaried jobs globally, as well as targeting 12,000 additional layoffs and plant closures in Europe. It also restructured operations in China and South America. The automaker previously said it expects a full-year loss because of the pandemic’s impact. It sees a pre-tax profit of between $500 million and $1.5 billion in the third quarter, and a loss in the fourth quarter as it launches several new vehicles."
30.22222222222221," CORRECTED-UPDATE 1-Ford's new CEO Farley promises urgency at automaker, shakes up management (Corrects spelling of new CFO’s name) DETROIT, Oct 1 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co’s new chief executive, Jim Farley, on Thursday promised the U.S. automaker would move with urgency, responding to investor and analyst criticism of the speed at which his predecessor acted. Farley, on his first day as Ford’s 11th CEO, also announced an executive shake-up that included naming a new chief financial officer. Ford’s promise to accelerate its turnaround is not new at a time when it is executing an $11 billion restructuring. Farley was named chief operating officer in February and promised a faster return to strong profits. He was officially tapped to succeed Jim Hackett in August. “During the past three years, under Jim Hackett’s leadership, we have made meaningful progress and opened the door to becoming a vibrant, profitably growing company,” Farley said in a statement on Thursday. “Now it’s time to charge through that door.” Hackett and Ford have been criticized by some on Wall Street for not moving quickly enough on its restructuring. At the end of the second quarter, the Dearborn, Michigan-based company had incurred only $3.9 billion of the projected $11 billion in charges. Ford on Thursday reaffirmed its goal for operating margins of 8%, something it identified as a 2020 target before the coronavirus pandemic hit. It did not specify when it would achieve this target. Ford’s operating margin was 4.1% last year, before falling to negative 4.8% in the first half of 2020 due to the coronavirus outbreak. The company also said John Lawler would succeed Tim Stone as CFO. Stone, who will remain with Ford through Oct. 15, accepted a job as COO and CFO with ASAPP Inc, an artificial-intelligence software company. Stone had been in the CFO job only since June 2019. Farley outlined his objectives during a virtual town hall meeting with Ford’s global team on Thursday, saying the company will allocate capital to its strongest franchises and high-growth opportunities, such as the F-Series pickup truck and its commercial business. It also will add more affordable vehicles to its global lineup, build electric vehicles at scale and stand up new autonomous-enabled businesses, he said. Decision making will be pushed down to the regional level."

32.884902840059794," Ford applies for German COVID-19 loan guarantees - Handelsblatt BERLIN (Reuters) - Ford Motor F.N, which operates two auto plants in Germany, has applied for 500 million euros ($582 million) of German loan guarantees aimed at cushioning the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, business daily Handelsblatt reported on Monday. While Germany has given coronavirus-related aid to companies such as auto parts supplier Leoni LEOGn.DE, Ford would be the first major carmaker in the country to receive such help from the government. The auto sector, one of the key pillars of Germany’s industry, was struggling even before the pandemic due to the shift towards electric vehicles and lower worldwide demand. Ford wants the federal government to grant most of the loan guarantees, while a smaller share is expected to come from German states, Handelsblatt said, without citing its sources. The company said it was part of its normal business to be in contact with financial institutions, without providing further details. The economy ministry declined to comment on the report. Ford’s German subsidiary was founded in 1925 and operates factories in the western city of Cologne and in Saarlouis close to the French border."

(Reuters) - Ford Motor Co F.N said on Thursday it has begun production of the new generation F-150 pickup truck at its Dearborn, Michigan, facility, and expects the redesigned model to go on sale in November. The new F-150 launch is “on time and on track,” Ford’s incoming Chief Executive Jim Farley said during an event Thursday at Ford’s Dearborn Truck plant. Ford shares were up 2.3% in early trading. The F-150 is Ford’s top selling vehicle and, along with other large pickups and commercial vans, generates the bulk of the company’s global profit. Ford also confirmed plans to build an electric version of the F-150, which is expected to come to market by mid-2022. Ford executives said the battery-electric version of the top selling truck will have a lifetime total cost of ownership that is roughly half that of the current gasoline-powered model. It also will include a large front trunk in place of an engine."

25.140449438202246," Keselowski promised good result, delivers big win at Richmond EditorsNote: Adds ART; Edit 2: Cleared up quote, other minor tweaks During a press conference on Thursday, a very confident Brad Keselowski said he expected to lead a lot of laps, be up front and potentially win his fourth NASCAR Cup Series race of the season on Saturday night. Check, check and check. The Team Penske driver led a race-best 192 of 400 laps, finished 2.5 seconds ahead of runner-up Martin Truex Jr. and captured that victory No. 4 of 2020 on Saturday night in the Federated Auto Parts 400 at Richmond Raceway. “It was quite a race here for us,” Keselowski said. “Man, this thing (his No. 2 Ford Mustang) was awesome.” It was so awesome that it cost him a shot at putting on a smoke show after the win. Keselowski said it was the same car he used in his earlier victory in New Hampshire, so, he said, “I wanted to do a really cool burnout with it but I want this car for Phoenix (the mile track which will be the site of the season’s championship deciding race). It’s 2 for 2.” The victory gives Keselowski a guaranteed berth in the second round of the series playoffs where he will join Kevin Harvick of Stewart-Haas Racing, who won last weekend’s race at Darlington, and 10 others who will be determined next week. The victory was his second at Richmond, with the other coming in 2016. Truex never had a shot over the final laps at catching Keselowski. “Never could get the balance right,” Truex, who was looking to win his third straight at Richmond, said. “Slow in the short run early, slow in the long run late. We just couldn’t put it all together. I was really surprised we were second after how it felt early in the race. I was like, ‘Oh boy, this is going to be a long night.’ Finishing third at Richmond was Penske’s Joey Logano. Austin Dillon of Richard Childress Racing, who finished second a week ago, was fourth. Chase Elliott of Hendrick Motorsports came home fifth. “We were way better than we’ve been here,” said Elliott, who was wrecked by Truex while going for the win a week ago. “So I thought that was a big improvement for us because we really need it here. This has been a really tough track for us.” All the drivers who finished in the top-10 were playoffs qualifiers. Saturday’s race was the second of three in the first round of the playoffs. The field of 16 drivers will be trimmed down to 12 after next weekend’s race at Bristol Motor Speedway. Defending series champion Kyle Busch had to start the race from the rear of the field after his Joe Gibbs Racing Toyota twice failed pre-race inspections. Busch, who was slated to start in the sixth position, was looking for his first victory of the season. In addition, Busch was without his regular crew chief Adam Stevens, who was suspended when officials found that their car finished the Darlington race down two lug nuts. None of that mattered as Busch used a fast car and good pit stops to make his way up into the top five by the middle of the second stage. He wound up sixth. Finding themselves below the cutline after Saturday were William Byron (3 points out of 12th), Cole Custer (8), Matt DiBenedetto (25) and Ryan Blaney (27). Clint Bowyer is on the bubble heading to Bristol. --Field Level Media"
35.58106169296987," Factbox - Electric delivery vehicle makers and major orders in the works (Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic has added a fresh boost to the rise of e-commerce, which has traditional automakers and startups racing to produce electric delivery vehicles that are increasingly sought-after thanks to their mileage efficiency and ability to harvest data and upgrade new software features overnight. Below are some of the major orders and automakers’ projects under way to bring more electric delivery vans and trucks to market: - Ford Motor Co is working on an electric version of its popular Transit van. Ford will roll out an all-electric version of the van for North America in model year 2022, mirroring the timetable for launching a similar model for the European market in 2022. - General Motors Co is developing an electric van for business users. The GM van – code-named BV1 – which is due to start production in late 2021. - Amazon.com Inc ordered 100,000 electric vans last year from startup Rivian Automotive LLC - in which it has invested. The first of those vans is due for delivery in 2021 and a Rivian spokeswoman said production will begin on schedule. - Amazon also ordered 1,800 delivery vans last month from Daimler AG’s Mercedes-Benz car and vans division for its European fleet. The first of those vans will be delivered by the end of this year. - Electric truck maker Nikola Corp and CNH Industrial NV truck unit Iveco are due to start producing a jointly developed electric big rig in 2021. Nikola is also working on a hydrogen fuel cell model that should begin production in 2023. - Tesla Inc is still working on its long-awaited Semi, a big rig it claims will have a range of up to 500 miles (805 km). Production of the Semi was originally slated to begin in 2019, but has been moved back to 2021. Tesla had a large number of pre-orders for the Semi from customers like UPS. - UPS has ordered 10,000 vans from UK startup Arrival Ltd - the majority for the U.S. market - in which UPS also owns a minority stake. UPS said it expects to take delivery of “small numbers” of Arrival vehicles beginning in 2021, with larger-scale production beginning in 2022. - Navistar International Corp will launch an electric school bus by the end of this year, with electric trucks following at an undisclosed point after that. Gary Horvat, vice president of eMobility at Navistar, said the truck maker is “getting a lot of requests from all across the country and all the industries we support” about electric trucks, with e-commerce also spurring demand. - Deutsche Post DHL Group’s StreetScooter electric vehicle unit plans to deploy its zero-emission delivery van across the United States as soon as 2022. - Electric delivery vehicle startup Chanje Energy Inc will deliver 1,000 electric vans to package delivery company FedEx Corp in California in the first half of 2021. Chanje’s vans are assembled in China by FDG Electric Vehicles Ltd, currently its main investor. - Workhorse Group Inc is due to start production in the fourth quarter of its electric delivery trucks at a rate of 100 vehicles per month. Chief Financial Officer Steve Schrader said that number will rise to 200 vehicles per month in 2021. UPS has ordered 50 electric trucks from Workhorse, with an option for 950 more. Workhorse is also among the bidders for a U.S. Postal Service contract to replace its fleet of delivery vans. - Michigan-based specialty vehicle company Shyft Group Inc recently announced it would launch production of electric delivery trucks in 2021 with a production capacity of up to 5,000 units per year. The company says it already has orders from “two leading parcel delivery companies,” but declined to name them. Startup Bollinger Motors, which has yet to produce any vehicles, announced last month it will start producing electric delivery vans in 2022."
31.578947368421044," Ford's incoming CEO wants the U.S. automaker to run like a Deere DETROIT (Reuters) - From the moment he was named chief operating officer and heir apparent to the top spot at Ford Motor Co in February, Jim Farley has touted the growth potential of its commercial vehicles. But it’s not just more trucks and vans that Farley wants to sell. As Farley prepares to takes over as chief executive on Oct. 1, he is betting Ford can transform its commercial vehicle business to generate recurring revenue through sales of services that take advantage of the software, data and connectivity in its F-Series pickup truck and Transit vans. “Think of it as a second F-150,” Farley told Reuters, referring to the U.S. automaker’s lucrative full-size truck business that generates $50 billion in annual revenue. “We have the F-150 everyone loves. There’s this other business out here that’s huge.” “Think of the data being more powerful than the fuel economy of the vehicle,” he added. Automakers like Ford have talked for a long time about generating post-sale revenue from connected vehicles, but they have struggled to deliver. As a result, Ford has been abandoned by growth-oriented investors, despite its lucrative F-series franchise. Ford now is trying to show it can grow, and build a competitive moat around its commercial vehicle business before electric car leader Tesla Inc, other startups and larger technology players like Amazon.com Inc enter those markets. The U.S. market alone last year accounted for more than $58 billion in sales of commercial trucks and vans, everything from Class-1 regular pickups to Class-7 heavy-duty trucks like the Ford F-750, according to ACT Research. Farley is counting on a new hire to help build data-generated revenue from Ford’s commercial vehicle business: Alex Purdy, former head of agricultural equipment maker Deere & Co’s Silicon Valley office. At Deere, Purdy led efforts to deliver artificial intelligence (AI) on the farm through smart equipment and founded John Deere Labs to help build a “sticky” relationship with customers. Deere’s aftermarket parts and services business accounted for about 15% to 20% of $35 billion in sales last year. In his first interview since his May hiring to lead Ford’s commercial vehicle connectivity business, Purdy said he “helped transition an industrial goods business that thought about metal bending into a service business.” Among the products developed by Deere while Purdy worked there were the ExactEmerge planter that offers improved seed spacing at higher speeds, freeing up workers for other jobs; and the See and Spray distribution system that will use smart cameras to distinguish between healthy and unhealthy crops, allowing for reduced use of herbicides when it’s introduced next year. Purdy, a 35-year-old former investment banker and consultant, grew up on a farm in Okotoks, outside Calgary, Canada, and describes himself as “passionate about smart connected vehicles, automotive, AI.” Ford is the leading commercial vehicle brand in the United States and Europe - with shares of 40% and almost 15%, respectively - thanks to the F-Series trucks as well as its Transit vans. “Ford is the 900-pound gorilla in the commercial business,” said Rhett Ricart, a big Ford commercial vehicle dealer in Columbus, Ohio. “They’ve always had this competitive advantage.” Earlier this year, Ricart moved into a new 116,000-square-foot commercial truck facility that dwarfs the old 18,000-square-foot building, and said he looks forward to working with Ford as they roll out additional connected services. Purdy and other Ford officials want Ford’s commercial customers to regularly pay for services, creating a revenue stream that flows throughout the vehicle’s life, beyond a one-time transaction every few years. Ford officials talk about products as such geolocation services to optimize route planning and reduce gasoline usage, predictive products that allow for faster oil changes and fleet management operations. “When you measure time as a commodity like money, there are lots of those kinds of experiences that customers are willing to pay for because they’re in the productivity business,” Farley said. The goal for Ford is to lower the total cost of ownership for its commercial customers; raise productivity, such as increased package delivery; and reduce downtime for customer vehicles, said Ted Cannis, head of Ford’s North American commercial vehicle business. “So now the total addressable market, instead of being just new-vehicle sales is the entire process - parts, service, accessories, connected services,” he said. Hans Schep, head of Ford’s European commercial vehicle business, said the shift in focus is playing out in meetings on quality. Five years ago, those meetings were about how to reduce Ford’s warranty costs, he said. Now, the discussions are about how to keep its customers’ vehicles on the road. Ford’s push in commercial vehicles will work hand-in-hand with the push to electrify its vehicles, including the F-150 and Transit. As part of the efforts, Ford and Germany's Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE said in June they would make up to 8 million units of mid-sized pickup trucks and commercial vans over the lifecycle of the vehicles, starting in 2022. Farley believes the automakers' alliance will allow Ford to use their combined scale to build its European commercial vehicle business even more."
31.152204836415365," Bosnian Tesla fan impatient for Cybertruck release builds a lookalike MOSTAR, Bosnia (Reuters) - A Bosnian fan of both Ford trucks and Elon Musk’s Tesla could not just sit on his hands waiting for the electric carmaker to release its Cybertruck, expected from late 2021. Instead he came up with his own version of the futuristic vehicle. It took eight months for IT specialists and engineers at Igor Krezic’s Stark Solutions company to disassemble a rugged Ford Raptor F-150 into its smallest parts and then transform it into petrol-powered vehicle that resembles a Cybertruck. The first drive through the streets of the southern town of Mostar drew a lot of attention, Mario Coric, the company manager, told Reuters. “Everybody was watching and half of them thought we made a tank, because people don’t know what the Cybertruck is. One girl even stopped and asked if this is the place where they are producing Tesla Cybertruck,” Coric said on Friday. Krezic declined to speak to Reuters. Though it may not look identical to Cybertruck’s functional prototype the pickup captures its spirit. “The owner wanted us to combine two opposite sides -- Ford and Cyber -- because he is a fan of both Tesla and Ford, so we merged two souls into one,” he said. “This one uses gasoline and Tesla uses electricity. We tried to copy as much as possible but our car is not the same size as the Cybertruck,” Coric added. There was no immediate comment from Tesla and Ford. Coric said Stark Solutions was now trying to register the pickup to be able to drive it on roads but they were encountering problems because sharp vehicle edges like those seen on the Cybertruck are banned in Bosnia. Tesla plans to build its $1.1 billion Cybertruck factory near Austin, Texas, ending an intense competition with neighbouring Oklahoma, the carmaker’s chief executive Musk announced in July. With a starting price of $39,000, the Cybertruck resembles an armoured vehicle and takes aim at the heart of Detroit automakers’ profitable truck business."
35.04398826979473," Jeep rolls out Wagoneer SUVs in challenge to GM and Ford DETROIT (Reuters) - Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCHA.MI on Thursday unveiled its new family of Jeep Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer sport utility vehicles, and the head of the Jeep brand told Reuters he wants to match or beat the sales of rival models made by General Motors Co GM.N. From a luxury image standpoint, “we want to beat Range Rover,” global Jeep brand President Christian Meunier said in an interview. “From a business standpoint, we want to beat GMC and Cadillac.” GM’s GMC Yukon and Cadillac Escalade model lines are leading sellers in the North American large, luxury SUV segment. Last year, GMC sold nearly 75,000 Yukons. Cadillac sold 35,424 Escalades, while Ford’s Lincoln brand sold 18,656 Navigators in 2019. Luxury sport utilities built on the underpinnings of big pickup trucks represent one of the most profitable segments in the global auto industry. Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer prices could range from $60,000 to $100,000, Meunier said. That is comparable to the Escalade and Yukon lineups. Most such vehicles are sold in North America and in certain Middle Eastern markets. Fiat Chrysler’s Jeep brand has not had an entry in this segment for decades. In Jeep’s absence, GM’s Cadillac Escalade and GMC Yukon and Ford’s Expedition and Lincoln Navigator models have dominated the segment in North America. Jaguar Land Rover’s Range Rover models have defined the premium end of the large luxury SUV market in North America and in other markets. Vehicles as large as the Grand Wagoneer, which is derived from a Ram pickup truck, are rare in China, the world’s largest market. The Wagoneer and Grand Wagoneer will be built in a factory in suburban Detroit - a handicap for selling in China. However, Meunier said “there’s an opportunity for China which we will test in the next few weeks.”"
32.37410071942445," Ford to cut 1,400 U.S. salaried jobs through buyouts by year end DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co F.N said on Wednesday it is targeting the elimination of 1,400 U.S. salaried jobs by year end as part of a multiyear $11 billion restructuring. The layoffs will be achieved through voluntary buyouts, the U.S. automaker said in an email sent to employees. The buyouts will be offered to employees who are eligible for retirement. “We’re in a multiyear process of making Ford more fit and effective around the world,” Ford’s Americas President Kumar Galhotra said in the email. “We have reprioritized certain products and services and are adjusting our staffing to better align with our new work statement.” Ford has said it was targeting a 10% operating margin in North America. Last year, before the coronavirus pandemic hit operations, Ford’s North American operating margin was 6.7%. The Dearborn, Michigan-based company previously said it expects a full-year loss because of the pandemic’s impact. It expects a pre-tax profit of between $500 million and $1.5 billion in the third quarter, and a loss in the fourth quarter as it launches several new vehicles. Last year, Ford cut 7,000 salaried jobs globally, as well as targeting 12,000 additional layoffs and plant closures in Europe. It also restructured operations in China and South America. Ford is changing chief executives on Oct. 1 to Jim Farley from Jim Hackett."
30.835734870316994," GM, Ford coronavirus U.S. ventilator projects close in on their finish lines DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co and Ford Motor Co said on Tuesday they are close to completing production of ventilators ordered by the Trump Administration in response to the surge in coronavirus cases, and are ramping down or exiting the operations. Many of the ventilators assembled by the automakers and other manufacturers have gone into a U.S. government stockpile as doctors shifted away from using invasive ventilators with COVID-19 patients. The government currently has 108,000 ventilators in its medical equipment stockpile, and 12,000 deployed at U.S. hospitals, the U.S. Health and Human Services department said Tuesday. GM and medical equipment maker Ventec Life Systems are in the “home stretch” toward completing a contract to deliver 30,000 critical care ventilators by the end of August under a $489 million contract with the federal government, the automaker said. GM and Ventec have already delivered more than 20,000 machines, GM spokesman Jim Cain said. Ford has assembled about 47,000 of the 50,000 ventilators it agreed to supply to partner General Electric Co, Ford spokeswoman Rachel McCleery said. GE has a $336 million contract with the government. HHS said it has received more than 69,000 ventilators assembled by GM and Ford and their partners, and “both of these delivery schedules are nearly complete.” Ford and GM earlier this year said they would employ a total of as many as 1,500 people on ventilator assembly lines. Automakers likened the efforts to their switch from making cars to tanks and planes during the Second World War. With North American car and truck factories back in operation, the Detroit automakers are winding down their forays into ventilator manufacturing, but continuing to make respiratory masks. GM has said it plans to transfer the ventilator-making operations at a factory in Kokomo, Indiana, to its partner Ventec on Sept.1. Union-represented GM workers employed at the plant will return to the automaker, and temporary workers will remain with Ventec. Ford transferred full-time workers who were building ventilators back to their home plants in May, and the majority of the temporary workers still assembling ventilators will have opportunities to land jobs building the new Ford Bronco SUV at a factory near Detroit, a company spokeswoman said Tuesday. The automakers’ efforts to build ventilators and other medical equipment were launched in a politically charged atmosphere as the first wave of the COVID-19 pandemic swamped the U.S. economy and healthcare system. The shortage of ventilators became a symbol of the nation’s struggle to respond. U.S. President Donald Trump put pressure on the automakers as part of a broader push to secure more than 130,000 ventilators by the end of 2020. The automakers used the medical equipment assembly operations set up in the spring to test safety protocols they later used to reopen their vehicle-making operations."

11.370262390670543," New Ford CEO Farley eyes expansion into tech fields (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co’s incoming Chief Executive Jim Farley said on Tuesday he wants to expand the automaker’s operations into related technology fields, including software, fleet management and electric vehicle charging. “These are new growth initiatives that could create a lot of value for the company,” Farley told Reuters, after Ford announced that he will succeed Jim Hackett as the automaker’s fourth CEO since 2014. In addition to Ford’s work on self-driving vehicles, “these are concrete areas that will change Ford,” Farley said. “They’re going to impact the company’s future look and feel.” In the meantime, Farley, 58, must wrestle with a painful restructuring of Ford’s global operations amid the ravages of the coronavirus crisis that has saddled the No. 2 U.S. automaker with large amounts of debt. Executive Chairman Bill Ford said the company had not considered outside candidates because “our board felt that we were on the right path” with Farley. “I wouldn’t expect any big surprises,” Ford said in terms of additional management changes. Farley, who joined the company in 2007, was named chief operating officer in March soon after his main internal rival for the top role at the automaker, Joe Hinrichs, announced his retirement. Farley has a reputation within Ford for being a skilled political operator with sharp elbows, which has garnered him some loyal fans but made him unpopular with others. Hackett and Farley will work together during a two-month transition period, and Hackett, 65, will continue as a company advisor through March 2021. Ford shares were up 1.1% in afternoon trading, after initially rising 3% on news of Farley’s succession as CEO. The stock has lost nearly 40% of its value since Hackett took the reins as chief executive in May 2017 and has been at lows not seen since the Great Recession in 2009. In the year to date, Ford shares have sunk 26% and its market capitalization of $27 billion is one-tenth that of rival Tesla’s. Hackett was handpicked for the top job at Ford by chairman Bill Ford, great-grandson of company founder Henry Ford. Hackett had no automotive experience, and his tenure at the automaker was rocky and accompanied by persistent rumors that he was about to be ousted, but Bill Ford stuck loyally by his chosen CEO for more than three years. Hackett’s relationship with Wall Street has, at times, been strained. Analysts have expressed frustration at his preference for often-impenetrable corporate language, instead of clear updates on where Ford was heading, and a perceived lack of urgency in restructuring the automaker. Last week, Ford reported a quarterly profit thanks to an investment by Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE in its self-driving Argo AI unit, more than offsetting an operating loss caused by a coronavirus-induced production shutdown. Ford said it expects a full-year loss, but added it should have ample cash on hand through the rest of 2020, even if global demand falls further or the coronavirus pandemic forces further shutdowns of vehicle assembly plants. Executives insisted that although the company had dramatically scaled back the amount it will spend on a global restructuring of its business, that overhaul had not stalled. ‘STEADY HANDS’ The No.2 U.S. automaker also faces slumping demand in China, its second-largest market. Ford lost $771 million in China last year, about half its 2018 loss, and its market share there has shrunk. The company has struggled to revive sales in China since its business began slumping in late 2017. In an SEC filing, Ford said Farley’s annualized base salary increased to $1,700,000 from $1,400,000, while Hackett’s remained unchanged at $1.8 million. Farley will receive stock options valued at $4,000,000. Hackett’s total compensation, including stock options, fell to $17.4 million in 2019 from $17.8 million in 2018. He will cease to have access to private aircraft for personal travel effective Oct. 1. Farley previously led Lincoln, South America, Ford of Europe and all of Ford’s global markets in successive roles. In the last two months, Ford has unveiled a redesigned version of its highly profitable F-150 pickup truck and a family of off-road Bronco SUVs as part of efforts to revitalize its lineup and pay down money borrowed to ride out the economic shock of the pandemic."

16.944024205748867," Ford will defer some quarterly payments on U.S. Energy Department loan (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co F.N said on Friday it had won approval to defer some quarterly payments due on its U.S. Energy Department retooling loan, but added it will repay the loan on time by June 2022. In September 2009, Ford was awarded a $5.9 billion low-cost government loan, an important source of liquidity in the aftermath of the financial crisis. The second-largest U.S. automaker said its loan was modified in June to reduce quarterly principal payments from $148 million to $37 million. Ford said it has $1.26 billion of remaining principal left on the loan. An Energy Department spokeswoman said “the flexibility the Loan Programs Office was able to provide through this loan modification is a good example of what (Energy) Secretary Brouillette meant when he asked for all of the Department’s resources to be supportive of the energy industry during the Covid-19 pandemic.” Ford said “with COVID-19 related economic uncertainty remaining, we believe that is worthwhile to further strengthen our balance sheet and increase liquidity to optimize our financial flexibility.” The company noted that if it opts to pay a dividend, repurchase shares above a certain threshold, or provide security to other lenders it will have to revert to the original payment schedule. The company said Friday that “deferring a portion of the principal until the maturity date will also result in incremental interest cost to Ford, in addition to the cost to modify the loan. All costs associated with the modification were covered by Ford through a higher interest rate.” But it added, “the financing remains very cost-effective.” Ford shares were down slightly, 0.3% to $6.72."

14.688427299703266," Ford posts profit, but expects full-year 2020 loss (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co F.N on Thursday said it expects a full-year loss but added it should have ample cash on hand throughout the rest of 2020, even if global demand falls further or the COVID-19 pandemic forces more shutdowns of vehicle assembly plants. The No. 2 U.S. automaker also said that on July 27 it repaid $7.7 billion of an outstanding $15.4 billion on its revolving credit facilities, and extended $4.8 billion of its three-year revolving credit lines. Ford's comments came as the company posted a quarterly profit thanks to an investment by Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE in its self-driving Argo AI unit, more than offsetting a loss caused by a coronavirus-induced production shutdown. The better-than-expected results and earnings outlook sent Ford’s shares up 2.5% in after-market trading. “The strong execution enabled us to deliver much better financial results than we expected just three months ago,” Chief Executive Jim Hackett said on a conference call with analysts. German automaker VW last month closed its $2.6 billion investment in Argo, which now is valued at $7.5 billion. Each automaker has a stake of about 40% in Argo. Ford said it expects a pre-tax profit of between $500 million and $1.5 billion for the third quarter and a loss for the fourth quarter, which features three significant product launches delayed by the shutdown earlier this year. In April, Ford warned that its second quarter loss would more than double to more than $5 billion due to the coronavirus outbreak. Chief Financial Officer Tim Stone said a focus on cost-cutting, a productive restart following a two-month shutdown, strong performance by the automaker’s captive finance arm and a solid pricing environment for its vehicles had helped mitigate the anticipated loss. “With Ford having passed the worst of COVID upheaval, we believe the focus now returns to the company’s redesign efforts. While the product opportunity is bright with F-150 and Bronco, there is more work to be done on restructuring,” Credit Suisse analyst Dan Levy said in a research note, referring to the company’s popular pickup truck and the new SUV it will offer later this year. The Dearborn, Michigan-based company said operating charges for its global restructuring would total $700 million to $1.2 billion for the year, down from $3.2 billion last year. Stone told reporters Ford’s redesign was “absolutely not stalled.” Ford also said it had more than 150,000 reservations for the new Bronco, which launches in the fourth quarter. That number was above internal expectations and Ford executives said they are working to increase production further, including possibly adding another shift at a plant. Ford ended the quarter with nearly $40 billion in cash, and said it should be able to maintain or exceed its target cash balance of $20 billion for the rest of 2020, even if global auto demand falls or if COVID-19 forces another big wave of plant closures. Ford reported net income in the second quarter of $1.1 billion, or 28 cents a share, compared with a profit of $100 million, or 4 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding items, Ford posted a second-quarter operating loss of $1.9 billion, or 35 cents a share. Analysts had expected a loss of $1.17 per share."

Ford Motor Chief Executive Jim Hackett can rest easier off the back of the automaker’s second-quarter results. The company actually turned a profit thanks to some fortuitous timing: It booked a $3.5 billion gain from closing Volkswagen’s investment in its self-driving unit, Argo AI. Even without that, though, the $2.8 billion operating loss was almost half what analysts had expected, according to Refinitiv data. Ford’s balance sheet looks better, too, as the company revealed on Thursday that it repaid almost $8 billion of its revolving credit lines this week. And the relaunch earlier this month of the Bronco SUV was so popular that there’s now an 18-month waitlist. Granted, Ford’s performance still lags archrival General Motors – but not as much as feared. That will relieve some of the pressure that had been steadily increasing on Hackett. It will take more work in controlling costs as well as developing self-driving and electric cars to prove that Ford’s better-than-expected showing was not a one-quarter aberration. (By Antony Currie) PACKAGE POWER. It’s no surprise that the pandemic has produced a huge increase in demand at the $117 billion United Parcel Service. The shipper said on Thursday that revenue rose 13% in the second quarter, thanks in large part to a 65% increase in shipments from businesses to people’s homes. What’s got Wall Street more excited was how operating margins held up – they only declined one percentage point to about 11%. A year ago, Amazon.com’s ambitions in delivering packages raised the specter of excess capacity. Now, UPS and FedEx can barely keep up. Moreover, the wave isn’t likely to ebb soon, as the pandemic continues. Holiday shipments will strain the system further. That means shippers can hike prices. UPS already introduced some surcharges at the end of May. The 10% rise in its share price suggests investors think those prices will stick for the long term, even if higher volumes don’t.

That follows a first-half slowdown in out-of-home and on-the-go products like bottled water, which brought organic top line year-on-year growth down to 2.8%. It was 3.6% in the same period of 2019. Thanks to asset sales, the reported top line shrunk more than 5%. It’s not all bad news for the $347 billion company. Investments in the Purina pet care brands are paying off. They were the highest contributors to growth. The health science unit also reported double-digit growth. With net debt of just 33 billion Swiss francs ($37 billion), Nestlé’s CEO Mark Schneider has plenty of room for a pet care and health spending spree. (By Dasha Afanasieva) TREASURE CHEST. The pandemic has helped Mediobanca store up some wealth. The Covid-19-induced regulatory ban on dividends and share buybacks, coupled with ongoing accounting leniency and higher earnings, has lifted the Milan-based bank’s common equity Tier 1 ratio to a record 16.1%. That’s higher than such European heavyweights as Banco Santander, Barclays and UBS. Mediobanca’s retail-lite business mix does not need such a large capital buffer. Reducing the Tier 1 ratio to the bank’s medium-term target of 13.5% would unlock over 1.2 billion euros, Breakingviews calculations show. That is about 20% of the bank’s current market capitalisation. The coronavirus crisis might bring unexpected losses, and regulators may become more stringent, but Mediobanca’s shareholders can reasonably hope to see some money coming their way.

(By Robyn Mak) GREEN SHOOTS. The pandemic tide has started to turn for some purveyors of bling. Despite terrible second quarters, Gucci-owner Kering and Italy’s Prada reported strong “revenge” buying, as Chinese customers spent with gusto when stores reopened after the lockdown. Kering said its main brands’ sales in mainland China since May have been between 40% and 70% higher than last year. Prada’s Chinese purchases soared more than 60% in July. Hermes International, which took a surprisingly big hit on operating margin, was cagier, simply saying that the Middle Kingdom had showed great dynamism. Chinese spend is likely to represent half of global luxury revenue in 2020, up from 36% last year. But the industry’s road to full recovery is tortuous as long as travel stays on hold and the rest of the world underperforms. Prada doesn’t expect to regain 2019 revenue levels until the end of 2021. For weaker players like Salvatore Ferragamo and Tod’s, the wait could be even longer. (By Lisa Jucca) TAKING THE MEDICINE. Britain’s 18 billion pound Lloyds Banking Group spooked investors on Thursday with a whopping 2.4 billion pound second-quarter charge for expected bad debt. That was two-thirds higher than the impairment Chief Executive António Horta-Osório booked in the first quarter. Shares were down 9% by 0815 GMT. Perversely, it could be a sign of strength. By taking the pain early, Horta-Osório has a bigger cushion to absorb actual loan losses. It’s unlikely that he’ll have to book additional hefty charges when government pandemic support programmes tail off later this year. Combined with a beefy 14.6% common equity Tier 1 capital ratio, that reduces uncertainty for investors. It also sends a useful signal to supervisors. They are less likely to unwind capital relief as long as the sector appears to be groaning under the weight of dud credit. In the topsy-turvy world of banking regulation, perceived weakness can be an advantage. (By Liam Proud)"

9.843081312410847," Engineer's best friend: How a dog-like robot is helping Ford retool plants (Reuters) - It runs, walks, and prances, rhythmically tapping its four feet before it sinks down on its haunches and crouches. Despite its name, Fluffy has no fur. But the bright yellow robot, leased by Ford Motor Co F.N from Boston Dynamics Inc, can fetch pictures and videos of a car factory with its five 'eyes' to help engineers design upgrades for workspaces. With an accurate camera scan, “we can build those pieces within the workstation, and we can see if there’s any interferences or if everything new is going to fit,” said Mark Goderis, Ford’s advanced manufacturing center digital engineering manager. Fluffy, controlled by an engineer with a handheld device, can travel up to 3 miles per hour (4.8 kph) for about two hours on its battery. Fluffy can also ride ‘Scouter,’ a small round robot, through a factory to save power, while the two companions gather data. Wherever Scouter cannot glide into, Fluffy can fill in the gaps. The automaker is testing the robots at its Van Dyke Transmission Plant in Michigan. The robots’ scans cost a fraction of the $300,000 needed for engineers to walk over millions of square feet in a factory to set up cameras on a tripod, Ford said in a statement. But the new engineers are just helpers, Goderis said. “Our goal isn’t to displace any of the workforce,” he said, but “automating our processes and making the engineers and people that work for our company more efficient and effective in building quality products.” Boston does not provide lease terms but Fluffy’s robot model, named ‘Spot,’ can be purchased for $74,500."
17.514970059880238," South Korean battery rivals' U.S. legal case turns into fight for jobs SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea’s rival battery-makers LG Chem and SK Innovation, which supply Volkswagen, Ford and GM, are caught in a growing row in the United States as the quest to create jobs complicates an ongoing legal fight, documents seen by Reuters show. Last year, LG Chem sued smaller rival SK Innovation over alleged theft of commercial secrets, seeking to bar SK from producing battery cells in the United States and from importing the components to make the cells. In February, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) made a preliminary ruling in LG Chem’s favour, with a final decision expected in October. SK Innovation and LG Chem declined to comment. LG Chem, which plans to build a battery factory with GM in Ohio, secured backing from Ohio’s governor, who said the ITC needs to “remedy SKI’s unfair competition,” the documents show, dating from May and seen on Tuesday showed. He said a failure to do so could threaten investment by LG Chem and GM that will “will bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States, ultimately employing around 1,100 American workers”. “SKI is accused of stealing LG Chem’s intellectual property and using it to directly compete against workers in Ohio,” Ohio governor Mike DeWine said in a statement to the ITC in May. SK Innovation’s clients Volkswagen and Ford say a potential sales ban would be detrimental to EV battery supply and to jobs just when the COVID-19 pandemic has created large-scale unemployment and economic damage. “To avoid a catastrophic supply disruption,” the commission should allow SK Innovation to manufacture EV batteries in SK’s proposed U.S. factory in Georgia, Volkswagen said in its public interest comments to the ITC in May. “The risk to such U.S. jobs is especially unacceptable in light of current economic conditions caused by COVID-19,” Ford said in its public interest comments to the ITC."
17.514970059880238," Volkswagen warns Korean battery row could lead to ""catastrophic"" supply disruption SEOUL, July 21 (Reuters) - Volkswagen and Ford said a U.S. legal row between South Korean battery makers could disrupt supplies of the key electric vehicle parts and cost U.S. jobs during the Covid-19 outbreak, according to documents submitted to a U.S. trade panel. The two automakers asked the United States International Trade Commission (ITC) to allow SK Innovation to manufacture batteries at its proposed U.S. factory in Georgia for use in Ford’s fully electric F-150 and other electric cars, the statements seen by Reuters showed. Last year, South Korean battery maker LG Chem sued small rival SK Innovation over alleged trade secret theft in the United States, seeking to bar SK from producing battery cells in the U.S. and importing the components necessary to make the cells. “Any remedial orders should seek to avoid collateral damage to SKI’s existing customers,” Volkswagen said in its public interest comments to the ITC in May. “To avoid a catastrophic supply disruption,” the commission should allow SK Innovation to manufacture EV batteries in the U.S. facility, Volkswagen said in the May statement. Ford said that LG Chem’s assertion that it can replace SK Innovation as a supplier is not “credible” given EV battery supply shortages and the long development period required for EVs. LG Chem declined to comment, citing ongoing litigation. SK Innovation is building its first battery plant in Georgia to serve Volkswagen’s EV base in neighboring Tennessee starting 2022. SK Innovation also plans to add a second U.S. plant to supply Ford’s electric pickup trucks and other models. “The risk to such U.S. jobs is especially unacceptable in light of current economic conditions caused by COVID-19,” Ford said in its public interest comments to the ITC. This year, the ITC preliminarily ruled in favor of LG Chem, dealing a blow to SK Innovation. The ITC is set to make a final ruling in the case on Oct. 5.

24.14383561643836," Ford says restrictions at Mexico plants 'not sustainable' MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co on Thursday said new staffing restrictions imposed on plants producing car parts in the Mexican state of Chihuahua were “not sustainable,” the latest sign U.S. automakers are still reeling from coronavirus lockdowns in Mexico. Mexico is a key part of a wider international supply chain crucial to U.S. carmakers, many of which operate factories across the border in Mexico due to lower labor costs. Chihuahua, where the state government has limited employee attendance to 50% in plants, is home to a Ford F.N engine plant and many auto parts producers. U.S. ambassador to Mexico Christopher Landau on Thursday said the Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker may have to shut some U.S. car plants as early as next week if they fail to receive Mexico-produced engines. Kumar Galhotra, president of Ford’s Americas and International Markets Group, said the company had “several suppliers” operating under restrictions imposed by Chihuahua state. “With our U.S. plants running at 100%, that is not sustainable,” Galhotra said in an emailed statement. “While we do not expect any impact to production next week, we are continuing to work with government officials on ways to safely and constructively resume remaining production,” he said. Mexico’s federal government has given automakers, mining firms and builders, with activities deemed essential, the green light to restart work, though some states have implemented their own restrictions as the coronavirus pandemic rages on. Landau said a senior Ford executive told him on Wednesday night about the company’s concern over parts produced in Chihuahua state. “They’re saying that they’re going to start shutting down factories in the United States as of next week if they don’t get that rolling,” Landau said, in a talk organized by the Atlantic Council. Alejandra de la Vega, Chihuahua’s minister of innovation and economic development, said she was in “constant contact” with Ford and spoke with a company executive Thursday morning, but did not specify what was discussed. De la Vega said Chihuahua had created a traffic light system to allow different sectors to gradually reopen from lockdowns, but added it was a “balancing act” to protect both public health and the economy. In May, when Mexico signaled it would delay the reopening of its factories, Mexican officials said their U.S. counterparts pushed for a speedy return, arguing that U.S. plants on American soil could not operate without them.

24.14383561643836," Ford's quarterly China sales rise for the first time in 3 years BEIJING (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co F.N said its China vehicle sales increased 3% in April-June from a year earlier, its first quarterly sales rise in the world's bigggest auto market in almost three years. Ford has been seeking to recover from a slump in sales unprecedented for a major global automaker in China, with sales sinking 26% last year after a 37% drop in 2018. Company sources have previously said those sales were hurt by an aging model lineup, a breakdown in relationships with its joint venture partners and dealers, as well as missteps by past management teams. China sales for the second quarter climbed to 158,589 units, Ford said in a statement, attributing the rise to a stronger vehicle lineup including new sport-utility vehicles and locally-made luxury Lincoln cars and “strong demand following the lifting of COVID-19 pandemic restrictions”. By contrast, rival General Motors GM.N said its sales in China for the quarter declined 5.3% to 713,600 units.

18.13725490196079," Ford seeks to extend maturities on US$5.35bn in loans NEW YORK, July 7 (LPC) - Ford Motor Co is in discussions with its lenders to extend maturities on US$5.35bn in existing credit facilities, two sources familiar with the discussions said. The second-largest US automaker has reached out to lenders within its top 20 bank group for a one-year extension of its US$3.35bn three-year main corporate revolving credit facility and US$2bn three-year supplemental revolving credit facility. The BB+/Ba1/BB+ automaker is seeking to refinance for the first time since downgrades in March removed its last investment grade rating. The move will test banks’ willingness to lend to a US household name in an industry that has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic. The company is offering an all-in spread of 225bp over Libor, split between a drawn spread of 175bp and an undrawn fee of 50bp for the main corporate and supplemental revolving credit facilities, one of the sources said. All lenders who agree to the extension will receive a 40bp fee on the amount extended. Lenders who choose not to extend will remain in the existing loans at a current all-in spread of 175bp over Libor, split between a drawn spread of 147.5bp and an undrawn fee of 27.5bp for the main corporate and supplemental revolving credit facilities. The company is leaving unchanged its fully funded US$1.5bn supplemental term loan and a US$10.05bn five-year corporate revolving credit facility tranche. JP Morgan leads the deal. Ford reported a 33.3% drop in US sales in the second quarter tied to shutdowns and shelter-in-place orders due to the coronavirus, the company said in a July 2 press release. Ford first reached out to its JP Morgan-led bank group in February to refinance US$15.4bn in revolving credits but in March decided to draw down on the facility and postponed its refinancing plans as market conditions deteriorated, two banking sources said at the time. Ford drew US$13.4bn under its corporate credit facility - including the three-year corporate revolver it is seeking to extend - as well as US$2bn under its three-year supplemental credit facility, for a total of US$15.4bn. The company said borrowings would be used to “offset the temporary working capital impacts of the coronavirus-related production shutdowns and to preserve Ford’s financial flexibility,” according to a March 19 press release. Commitments on the current extension request are due July 22. A JP Morgan spokesperson declined to comment. Emails to a Ford media relations representative were not returned by press time.

12.762520193861066," Ford's Bronco SUV bucking to take on FCA's Jeep DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co F.N on Monday rolled out the product and marketing strategy for its new family of Bronco SUVs designed to take a bite out of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles' FCHA.MIFCAU.N profitable Jeep franchise. Ford’s Bronco lineup, launching later this month, will include two- and four-door models, as well as a smaller Bronco Sport. The vehicles’ boxy looks, their new bucking bronco logo, a “Bronco Nation” online fan club along with the “Built Wild” marketing campaign are all part of Ford’s plan to muscle into the lucrative off-road adventure segment that Jeep has dominated for decades. The new Bronco lineup will offer off-roading technology aimed at people who want a comfortable ride on the highway, and who go off-roading on sand, gravel or dirt, not clambering over boulders, Ford Chief Operating Officer Jim Farley said in an interview. “We see our vehicle different than Wrangler,” the Jeep model favored by extreme off-road enthusiasts, Farley said. “We see it as a vehicle you can live with every day.” Bronco’s real mission is to boost profits as Ford strives to repay debt taken on to weather the coronavirus slowdown. Last year, Ford said retooling its Wayne, Michigan, assembly plant to build Ranger mid-sized pickup trucks and the Bronco instead of hybrid and compact cars would improve operating earnings by more than $1 billion. Teaser images from Ford and spy photos from auto magazines have hinted the new Bronco will take styling cues from the first generation of Ford Broncos, built from 1966 to 1977, which were boxy two-door models now considered one of the earliest SUVs. Ford withdrew the Bronco line in 1996 amid falling demand for two-door SUVs. While FCA declined to comment on the Bronco, Chief Executive Mike Manley and his predecessor, Sergio Marchionne, invested heavily in the Jeep brand. The Jeep family includes six nameplates in North America, from the tiny Renegade to the Gladiator pickup, with several additional models sold overseas and more coming. Jeep generates a huge share of FCA’s profit. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas three years ago estimated the Jeep brand alone was worth 120% of the parent company’s market value — more than $20 billion at the time. Last year, Fiat Chrysler sold about 1.5 million Jeeps globally, down from almost 1.6 million in 2018. Ford’s aspirations are lower starting at 125,000 sales in the first year, according to suppliers. Sales of the earlier Bronco peaked in 1979 at around 100,000. As part of the Bronco launch, Ford will create four U.S. off-road testing grounds next year, dubbed “Off-Roadeos.” Ford will unveil online the four-wheel-drive SUVs at 8 p.m. ET on July 13, when customers can begin placing $100 deposits."

The U.S. automaker's Chongqing-based venture with Changan 000625.SZ said on Monday its sales jumped 7.7% from a year earlier. It did not disclose the number of vehicles sold. Ford’s new SUV models including Escape, Edge and Explorer are selling well and contributed to growth in past months, it said in a statement. Jiangling Motors Corp (JMC) 000550.SZ, in which Ford owns a stake, said in a filing last week that it sold 39,192 vehicles last month, up 67% year on year. JMC sells Ford-branded sport-utility vehicles (SUV) and vans as well as JMC-branded commercial vehicles. The ventures also saw sales up in April and May, putting the Dearborn, Michigan-based company on track for its first quarterly growth since the third quarter of 2017. It said the aging model lineup caused the sales slide. Ford's rival General Motors GM.N said its sales in China dropped 5.3% between April and June."

10.152284263959386," Ford, VW will stay neutral on challenges to Trump vehicle emissions rule: document WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Four major automakers will not take a position on legal challenges to the Trump administration’s decision to dramatically weaken Obama-era fuel economy standards but want to weigh in on any court fix, according to a document seen by Reuters. The Trump administration in March finalized rollback of U.S. vehicle emissions standards to require 1.5% annual increases in efficiency through 2026. That is far weaker than the 5% annual increases in the discarded rules adopted under President Barack Obama. Ford Motor Co, Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE, Honda Motor Co and BMW AG struck a voluntary agreement with California in July 2019 on vehicle emissions rules. On Monday, the four automakers plan to ask a U.S. Appeals Court in Washington for permission to be heard in the court challenge ""to ensure that any remedy imposed by this court is both appropriate and achievable,"" according to a draft of the filing. Last month, a group of 23 U.S. states led by California, as well as the District of Columbia and some major cities, challenged the Trump vehicle rule. Volkswagen said on Friday its “preference continues to be one set of national standards that’s achieved through an agreement between the federal government and California.” Other major automakers like General Motors Co, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV and Toyota Motor Corp have sided with the Trump administration on the rollback. Those companies also sided with the Trump administration in a separate lawsuit over whether the federal government can strip California of the right to set zero emission vehicle requirements. California Air Resources Board chair Mary Nichols told Reuters on Wednesday the board hopes to finalize the voluntary agreements in the “next few weeks” as memorandums of understanding with the individual automakers."

10.152284263959386," America's best-selling vehicle becomes a cybertruck with a familiar face DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co F.N on Thursday unveiled the next generation of its F-150 pickup in an online event, showing a truck with a familiar look but that incorporates the automaker's new strategy for profiting from software and connectivity. The new F-150 and the soon-to-launch Mach-E electric SUV will be the first Ford vehicles equipped with electronic systems that allow for extensive over-the-air software upgrades. Rival Tesla Inc TSLA.O pioneered the use of smartphone-style updates to improve vehicles and generate revenue long after the sale. General Motors CoGM.N has launched comparable technology on several vehicles. Now the F-150, part of the best-selling line of vehicles in the United States with annual sales equivalent to Tesla’s current volume, will bring upgradeable, fully connected vehicle technology to the mainstream market. Ford will offer a hybrid version of the F-150. An electric model is expected within two years. The new F-150’s design does not shock like the Tesla Cybertruck, with an exterior hard to distinguish from the current model. When it launches this fall, the truck will aim for traditional buyers in the U.S. heartland, down to the American flag stamped into the dashboard. However, customers who opt to pay for it will be able to download software to enable hands-free driving on highways when it becomes available next year, Ford said. Commercial customers will be offered software that can help with routing or tracking vehicles in a fleet. Ford’s chief operating officer, Jim Farley, said in an interview that after-sale software upgrades for customers may not be the biggest benefit the company gets from connecting F-series trucks to the cloud. Connected F-150s can tell Ford when there’s a problem with engine control software, and enable a quick fix. “It’s a gamechanger for us,” Farley said. The time to detect a warranty problem “goes from weeks and months to days and hours.” Ford will also be able to know what features customers use and how, and what equipment could be safely omitted to cut costs. “We don’t have to guess anymore,” he said."
7.960199004975116," Ford signs deal with Vodafone for private 5G network in UK (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co has signed a deal with Vodafone Group Plc to install a private 5G network at the car maker’s electric-vehicle (EV) battery facility in UK’s Essex, the companies said in a joint statement on Thursday. The project is part of a 65-million-pound ($80.87 million) investment in 5G backed by the UK government, according to Ford and Vodafone, and would be among the first of its kind in Britain. The private 5G network at Ford’s facility will replace older Wi-Fi networks and help speed up the production of EV components, according to the companies. “For a single EV product, this could generate more than a half a million pieces of data every minute”, the statement said, adding that the upgrade will provide faster and more accurate manufacturing control and analysis. Earlier this week, Toyota Production Engineering Corporation selected Finland’s Nokia Oyj to install an industrial-grade 5G private wireless network at its manufacturing design center in Fukuoka, Japan."
14.218009478672991," Ford's redesigned F-150 pickup will offer greater connectivity, sleeper seat DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co F.N next week will show the next generation of its brawny F-150 pickup truck that offers a new sleeper-seat feature and over-the-air software updates in a machine Ford is counting on to help pay off coronavirus-related debts. The new F-150, part of the best-selling vehicle line in the United States, accounts for $50 billion in annual revenue, and a significant share of Ford's annual profit. While Tesla Inc TSLA.O and General Motors Co GM.N have moved faster on over-the-air software upgrades and high-speed in-vehicle data networks, the new F-150 will bring such technology squarely into the mainstream. The new truck, expected to launch later this year, is a critical plank in Chief Operating Officer Jim Farley’s plan to slash $5 billion in warranty costs, speed Ford’s push into vehicle connectivity and add to the No. 2 U.S. automaker’s already-strong position in the North American commercial vehicle market. Ford has borrowed more than $20 billion to ride out the economic shock from the coronavirus pandemic. Profit from the new F-150 will be key to paying that money back. Ford is not taking big risks with the exterior look of the new truck given its sales dominance, instead focusing on improving the interior, according to those who have seen it. Ford is scheduled to publicly show for the first time the new F-150 online on June 25. “It’s really about technology and productivity,” Farley said at a Deutsche Bank conference on June 10. One prominent feature will be the lay-flat passenger seat like those seen in first-class cabins on some planes, said a person familiar with the plans who asked not to be identified. “You can basically live in the truck,” the person said. Ford's nicer interior, including a larger display screen, follows a similar move by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCHA.MIFCAU.N with its new Ram truck, which received enthusiastic reviews for its stylish interior and optional 12-inch display screen. “Ram taught everybody a little bit of a lesson,” said Rhett Ricart, owner of Ricart Ford in Columbus, Ohio. “The old 5-inch screen for your navigation and radio controls is gone. They’re all going to be 10-, 12-, 15-inch screens. That was started by Tesla.” The F-150’s new electrical architecture will allow Ford to provide over-the-air updates to key modules controlling the vehicle, replacing trips to the dealership. The new truck’s connectivity also will help Ford boost sales to commercial customers, and reduce warranty costs, Farley told investors. The F-Series truck has been around since 1948, while the F-150 debuted in 1975. Sales of the current version have remained strong despite its age, and the new model could help Ford hold or even build its position in the segment, said Sandy Munro, chief executive of Michigan-based consulting firm Munro & Associates. “If they add the same stuff as what Ram did and if they can add more stuff like Tesla’s doing, there’ll be a gigantic gap between Ford, and Ram and Chevy,” he said. The key for Ford will be to avoid the kinds of costly production problems that hobbled the launch of the new Explorer SUV last year. Ford acknowledged it erred in trying to launch the Explorer and Lincoln Aviator simultaneously while breaking in a new assembly line at its 95-year-old plant in Chicago. Farley has been visiting the plants in Dearborn, Michigan, and Kansas City, Missouri, that will build the new F-150. Despite delays related to the virus, he said the launch is in “really good shape.”"
14.218009478672991," Ford to offer hands-free driving in 2021 - six years after Tesla (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co F.N said on Thursday that it will offer hands-free driving on its new Mustang Mach-E in fall 2021, six years after Tesla Inc TSLA.O and four years after General Motors Co GM.N introduced similar systems. The system, called Active Drive Assist, will be offered on several Ford models, most notably the Mustang Mach-E, an all-electric crossover vehicle that goes on sale later this year and is targeted at the Tesla Model Y market. Ford said U.S. buyers can order the Mustang Mach-E this fall with the Active Driver Assist hardware package, which includes extra radar sensors and a driver-facing camera, but the software won’t be ready until fall 2021. Tesla introduced its first semi-automated hands-free driver assist package, called Autopilot, in 2015. GM followed two years later with a similar semi-automated feature called Super Cruise on the Cadillac CT6. Tesla has constantly revised and updated Autopilot and now offers the feature across its entire four-model range. GM is expanding Super Cruise to other Cadillac models this fall and will offer an enhanced version to other GM brands over the next three years. Ford said the Active Drive Assist software can be installed when ready next year through a wireless over-the-air update, similar to how some computer software programs are installed and mobile phone apps are updated. Tesla has offered over-the-air updates since 2012."

14.192495921696576," Ford recalls 2.15 million U.S. vehicles for potentially faulty door latches WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Wednesday it will recall 2.15 million U.S. vehicles with potentially faulty door latches. The second largest American automaker said the recall covers many 2011 through 2015 model-year vehicles. The recalled vehicles may not have had all door latches replaced or correctly replaced when repaired by dealerships under recalls issued in 2015 and 2016. Ford said a recalled vehicle with a faulty latch may unlatch while driving, but said it is not aware of any reports of accident or injury related to the condition. Ford previously recalled more than 5 million vehicles for varying door latch-related issues since 2015 and has booked hundreds of millions of dollars in costs. The recall covers some Ford Fiesta, C-Max, Focus, Mustang. Fusion, Escape, Transit Connect, Lincoln MKZ and MKC vehicles. Ford said the latches have a part susceptible to cracking that in some circumstances can lead to doors failing to close. If motorists repeatedly attempt to close the door, it may temporarily close but could open during driving."

The alliance was forged in January 2019 and expanded later, as carmakers join forces to invest in electric and self-driving technology in a bid to save billions of dollars. The automakers will collaborate on a city van built by Volkswagen, a 1-ton cargo van developed by Ford, and a Volkswagen medium pickup built on the Ford Ranger platform, beginning 2022. The No. 2 U.S. automaker will also develop a new electric vehicle for Europe based on Volkswagen’s Modular Electric Drive toolkit by 2023, and deliver more than 600,000 units over several years. “This collaboration will efficiently drive down development costs, allowing broader global distribution of electric and commercial vehicles, and enhance the positions of both companies,” Volkswagen Group CEO Herbert Diess said on Wednesday. The companies will also develop an autonomous-vehicle business based on Argo AI’s self-driving technology. Last week, Volkswagen closed a $2.6 billion investment in Argo AI, Ford’s self-driving cars venture, which is now jointly controlled by the alliance."

Ford and other Detroit automakers resumed production in the United States on May 18. Farley said in the first three weeks following the restart, Ford built about 96% of its planned volume. “We’re really pleased with our start,” he said, adding that beginning the week of July 8 Ford will begin adding back a third shift of work at many of its plants. Ford’s retail sales in May rose 44% from April, and its F-Series large pickup truck saw retail sales rise 5.3% from last year and gain 2.4 percentage points of market share, Farley said. The upcoming launches of the new version of the No. 2 U.S. automaker’s highly profitable F-150 as well as the new Bronco SUV and Mustang Mach-E electric SUV are in “really good shape,” he said. However, Farley acknowledged there will be “some impact” on the timing of those launches because Ford couldn’t get into the plants during the shutdown. Ford will introduce electric versions of the F-150 and its Transit van in the next 24 months, he said. Also on Wednesday, Ford finalized details of its alliance with Germany's Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE. Farley said Ford also remains open to other investors in its Argo AI self-driving unit in addition to VW. Regarding Ford’s ongoing restructuring, Farley said work remains to be done in Europe and South America. “For both regions, the reality is the pandemic means everything is on the table.”"

In March, Ford, General Motors Co GM.N and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) FCHA.MIFCAU.N told salaried employees to work from home to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Ford brought back 12,000 salaried employees last month, and others have been told they can work from home until September, spokeswoman Marisa Bradley said. Given potential workplace changes caused by the outbreak, a facility consolidation the No. 2 U.S. automaker had already launched could accelerate. “If we know we are going to have a smaller population that’s going to come back to work, we could look at maybe shrinking our footprint,” Bradley said. U.S. companies are wrestling with who can work from home and how much office space is necessary. Ford Chief Operating Officer Jim Farley said recently many salaried employees can work from home, and the Dearborn, Michigan-based company could eliminate offices. The shutdown is “really an opportunity to redesign how we do work,” he said. FCA has one of the largest offices spaces in the country with its U.S. headquarters in Auburn Hills, Michigan. A small number of employees who work in testing facilities have returned to work there, and more salaried workers will return slowly over the coming months, a spokeswoman said. A GM spokesman said the No. 1 U.S. automaker is not looking at consolidating office space, but is bringing salaried workers back in phases, focusing first on those “who need to be in the office to do their job.” Hourly workers in the automakers’ U.S. plants largely returned to work May 18 after a two-month lockdown, using greater safety measures such as screening workers for fevers and providing face masks."

The U.S. auto industry reopened many plants last week after a two-month shutdown due to the global pandemic. To ensure safety during the outbreak, companies imposed new safety measures, including screening employees, use of face masks and social distancing. Ford paused production at its Claycomo, Missouri, plant for an hour on Tuesday after a worker tested positive. Work resumed at the plant, which builds the F-150 pickup truck and Transit van, without workers being sent home following a deep cleaning, Ford spokeswoman Kelli Felker said Wednesday. General Motors Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) said Wednesday they have had workers test positive since the restart, but have not been forced to idle plants. They did not disclose the number of workers affected. On Wednesday, a union leader at Ford’s Kentucky Truck Plant said on Twitter a worker there tested positive, but had not worked since May 21. Felker said the plant never closed. Last week, Ford closed two assembly plants, due to a positive test at its Dearborn, Michigan, factory and a parts shortage due to a positive test at a supplier that closed the Chicago plant. It had marked the second consecutive day for closures in Chicago following two positive tests. United Auto Workers Local 600, which represents hourly workers in Dearborn, last week demanded testing for every worker there and that Ford shut down the plant for 24 hours after a positive test. Ford said the safety of its workers is a top priority and cited the safety measures it has developed in conjunction with the UAW. In Mexico, Ford told workers it was targeting a May 28 restart at its Hermosillo plant. GM and FCA have restarted operations in Mexico."
14.593698175787726," Mexico's auto industry restart gathers steam as lockdown eases MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico's auto industry reopening picked up pace on Tuesday, with Fiat Chrysler FCHA.MI and BMW AG BMWG.DE joining peers in gradually dusting off operations even as the wait for approvals slowed the return of some companies. In mid-May, officials said the industry could exit a mandatory coronavirus lockdown before June 1 if safety measures were approved. However, some Mexican governors have urged caution as new coronavirus infections and deaths ticked higher, in a sign of what is expected to be a bumpy return as complex North American supply chains are linked back together. Fiat Chrysler on Tuesday began reopening two facilities in the central Mexican city of Toluca after a gradual restart of its operations in the northern city of Saltillo a day earlier, said a company spokesman. “We are opening up with only 40% of personnel at each plant. It’s an orderly and secure reopening, following all the protocols the Health Secretary has given us,” he said. The announcement means two of Detroit’s Big Three automakers have begun restarting Mexican operations. The third, Ford, said on Tuesday it was working closely with the government to comply with health protocols. “We’re hoping we can get its approval to operate,” the company said in a statement. In a letter to workers viewed by Reuters, Ford said it has set May 28 as a provisional date for the gradual restart of its plant in Hermosillo, Mexico. Ford did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the document. BMW said it would restart operations at its plant in the central Mexican state of San Luis Potosi on May 27. General Motors Co GM.N began opening production lines at its Mexican plants in Ramos Arizpe in the northern state of Coahuila and in the central city of Silao on Thursday. Japanese automakers Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, Nissan Motor Co Ltd 7201.T and Honda Motor Co Ltd 7267.T are also restarting in Mexico. German carmakers Volkswagen and Audi are still awaiting authorization for their plants in Puebla state, whose government said on Friday that conditions “do not exist” yet for a restart."

17.876106194690262," Trump visits Ford plant in politically crucial Michigan, leaves mask off for cameras YPSILANTI, Mich. (Reuters) - President Donald Trump traveled on Thursday to the crucial U.S. election battleground state of Michigan to visit a Ford Motor Co F.N plant amid tensions with its Democratic governor during the coronavirus pandemic, opting not to wear a protective face mask for the cameras. Trump toured the Ford plant, which has been recast to produce ventilators and personal protective equipment, and held a roundtable discussion with African-American leaders concerning vulnerable populations hit by the virus. Trump, who has said he is taking a drug not proven effective for the coronavirus after two White House staffers tested positive, did not wear a mask during any of his public events at the plant in the city of Ypsilanti even though Ford on Tuesday reiterated its policy that all visitors must wear them. Trump has consistently disregarded guidance from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention urging people to wear masks in close company to try to curb the spread of the virus. Surrounded by Ford executives wearing masks, Trump told reporters he had put one on out of the view of cameras. “I had one on before. I wore one in the back area. I didn’t want to give the press the pleasure of seeing it,” Trump said. When asked if Trump was told it was acceptable not to wear a mask in the plant, Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford said, “It’s up to him.” The company later said in a statement that the chairman had “encouraged” Trump to wear a mask when he arrived, adding that the President had obliged during a private viewing of three two-seater Ford GT sports cars. In an interview cnn.it/2ZrT3Os with CNN, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said there would be a ""very serious conversation"" with Ford for permitting the President to violate state governor Gretchen Whitmer's executive order on masks. The order specifies any person who is medically able must wear a mask in enclosed public spaces. “They knew exactly what the order was and if they permitted anyone, even the President of the United States, to defy that order, I think it has serious health consequences potentially to their workers,” Nessel, a Democrat, said. Trump told Nessel on Twitter she shouldn’t be taking her anger out on Ford. “Not their fault, & I did put on a mask. No wonder many auto companies left Michigan, until I came along!” Trump, seeking re-election on Nov. 3, has urged states to loosen coronavirus restrictions so the battered U.S. economy can recover, even as public health experts warn premature easing of restrictions could spark a second wave of infections. Whitmer, seen as a potential vice presidential running mate for presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, is facing a backlash from critics in a state hit hard by the last recession. Trump has encouraged anti-lockdown protests against Whitmer in the state. Whitmer, whose state has been hit by devastating floods, on Thursday moved to further reopen Michigan’s economy through a series of executive orders. Trump on Wednesday threatened to withhold federal funding from Michigan over its plan for expanded mail-in voting, saying without offering evidence that the practice could lead to voter fraud - though he later appeared to back off the threat. On Thursday he pledged federal support to help with the dam breaks. Whitmer spoke with Trump on Wednesday. “I made the case that, you know, we all have to be on the same page here. We’ve got to stop demonizing one another and really focus on the fact that the common enemy is the virus,” Whitmer told CBS News. Whitmer added, “Threatening to take money away from a state that is hurting as bad as we are right now is just scary.” Trump won in Michigan in the 2016 election, the first Republican to do so since 1988."
24.590163934426222," Ford shuts two U.S. assembly plants due to COVID-19 infections DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co on Wednesday closed two U.S. assembly plants as the coronavirus pandemic wreaked early havoc with the No. 2 U.S. automaker’s plan to restart North American production and begin making its most profitable vehicles again. Ford closed its Dearborn, Michigan, plant due to a positive COVID-19 test by one worker, while its Chicago assembly plant was closed due to a parts shortage, Ford spokeswoman Kelli Felker said. Ford declined to say which supplier had the issue, but a person familiar with the matter told Reuters that Lear Corp had closed a plant in Hammond, Indiana. Lear later confirmed in an email that it had closed the plant due to a positive test. It was the second day in a row Ford had closed its Chicago plant, after closing it twice on Tuesday after two workers on different shifts also tested positive. Both the Dearborn and Chicago plants are expected to resume production later on Wednesday, Felker said. In the Dearborn and Chicago positive tests, all exposure occurred outside the workplace, Felker said. Dearborn builds the highly profitable F-150 pickup truck, while the Chicago plant makes the Ford Explorer and Lincoln Aviator SUVs. The U.S. auto industry, including Ford, reopened many plants on Monday after a long shutdown due to the outbreak. To ensure safe operation amid the health crisis, Ford and other automakers and suppliers imposed new safety measures, including screening employees who enter the building, mandating the use of face masks and face shields, and social distancing along the assembly line where possible. The reopening of car plants will be a closely watched test of whether workers across a range of U.S. industries will be able to return to factories in large numbers without a resurgence of infections. General Motors Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV said on Wednesday they had no issues at any North American plants."
24.590163934426222," Ford's Chicago plant operating after brief shutdowns Tuesday linked to COVID-19 infections DETROIT, May 20 (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co briefly closed its Chicago assembly plant twice on Tuesday, after reopening following a two-month shutdown amid the coronavirus pandemic, as two employees tested positive for COVID-19, a spokeswoman said on Wednesday. The plant, which builds the Ford Explorer and Lincoln Aviator SUVs, was operating again on Wednesday. A day earlier, it suspended operations twice for several hours - once when a worker went home sick, and then after a second worker received news they had tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, Ford spokeswoman Kelli Felker said. The U.S. auto industry, including Ford, reopened many plants on Monday after a long shutdown due to the outbreak. To ensure safe operation amid the health crisis, the No. 2 U.S. automaker, and other automakers and suppliers imposed new safety measures, including screening employees who enter the building, mandating the use of face masks and face shields, and social distancing along the assembly line where possible. The reopening of car plants will be a closely watched test of whether workers across a range of U.S. industries will be able to return to factories in large numbers without a resurgence of infections. At Ford’s Chicago plant, the brief work stoppages came during the first and second shifts, and both employees worked in a building separate from the main, larger plant, the spokeswoman said. The entire plant had to be closed, however, as the building is used to build additional vehicles as well as to put parts in order for the larger plant before vehicles are assembled. Felker noted that due to the incubation time for the virus, both employees contracted it outside the plant and that the company immediately took safety measures aimed at curbing the spread of the disease. “When two employees who returned to work this week tested positive for COVID-19, we immediately notified people known to have been in close contact with the infected individuals and asked them to self-quarantine for 14 days,” she said in a statement. “We also deep cleaned and disinfected the work area, equipment, team area and the path that the team member took.” (Reporting by Ben Klayman; Editing by Bernadette Baum)"
29.62264150943397," Ford requires visitors to wear masks but unclear if Trump will comply WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co F.N on Tuesday reiterated its policy that all visitors to its manufacturing plants must wear a mask but said the White House will ultimately decide if U.S. President Donald Trump will comply during a planned visit. Trump plans to visit a Ford plant in Ypsilanti, Michigan, on Thursday that is being used to manufacture ventilators. Ford issued a revised statement late on Tuesday that signaled it may allow Trump to violate a policy it spent weeks locking in to allow it to operate its plants safely. Asked whether he will wear a mask when he visits Ford, Trump said that “where it’s appropriate I would do it.” The decision depends on the situation and if he “standing right next to everybody,” he added. “Our policy is that everyone wears PPE to prevent the spread of COVID-19,” Ford spokeswoman Rachel McCleery said on Tuesday. “The White House has its own safety and testing policies in place and will make its own determination.” The company’s policy handbook to address the coronavirus pandemic, released May 1, says flatly that face masks must be worn “at all times” at U.S. manufacturing plants by all employees and “all visitors.” McCleery said the company “shared all of Ford’s safety protocols, including our manufacturing playbook, employee pamphlet and self-assessment survey with the White House ahead of time and in preparation for this trip.” Last week, Trump toured a mask distribution center in Pennsylvania but did not wear a mask. The United Auto Workers and the Detroit Three automakers held talks about safety protocols to allow for Monday’s resumption of auto production. Last month, Vice President Mike Pence wore a mask during a tour of a General Motors plant in Indiana making ventilators, as did GM Chief Executive Mary Barra. But Barra told participants at a roundtable after a tour that they could remove their masks."

43.96728016359919," Most Ford U.S. dealers got federal payroll protection loans: COO DETROIT (Reuters) - Most of Ford Motor Co's F.N U.S. dealers received payroll protection loans from the U.S. government amid the coronavirus pandemic, the automaker's chief operating officer said on Thursday. Early in the outbreak, Ford “made sure” its U.S. dealers applied with the U.S. Small Business Administration for federal loans to protect their payrolls and employees, Jim Farley said during the company’s annual shareholder meeting held online. “This really paid off because about 90-plus percent of our dealers applied and now more than 80% have been funded,” he said. Ford worked closely with its network of just over 3,000 U.S. franchised dealers to ensure they were aware of the loan process and tracked their progress, spokesman Said Deep said after the meeting. “They are independent businesses, and they all have their own relationships with their banks, so that was the extent of our involvement,” Deep said in an email. Auto dealers were hard hit by the outbreak, with some states temporarily barring new-vehicle sales. Sales have plummeted amid stay-at-home orders aimed at curbing the spread of the highly contagious novel coronavirus. The U.S. government’s “Payroll Protection Program” to aid small businesses, part of an economic relief package passed by Congress, opened chaotically in April and ran out of funds in less than two weeks. The SBA then processed a second batch of applications. The loans are forgivable if companies use at least 75% on payroll expenses. The program has been criticized for not getting loans to the smaller firms that need them and have few other capital sources. Among the companies that have returned the loans are dealer groups AutoNation Inc AN.N and Penske Automotive Group Inc PAG.N. Others that returned their SBA loans included the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team, restaurant chains Shake Shack Inc SHAK.N and Potbelly Corp PBPB.O, and online news site Axios. Ford’s Farley said Thursday the No. 2 U.S. automaker watches its dealers’ profitability closely, and that in March and April those dealers were in “great shape” and their financial health was improving daily as state economies reopened. Asked when Ford might reinstate the dividend payout it suspended in March, Chief Financial Officer Tim Stone said that would be an option after the company repays its corporate revolver debt. The suspension saved Ford money at an annual rate of $2.4 billion."

48.94067796610171," Ford to restart UK engine output next week LONDON, May 13 (Reuters) - Ford will restart output at its two British engine factories from May 18 which means all of the U.S. carmaker’s European manufacturing sites will be in operation next week, after shutdowns due to the coronavirus outbreak. Ford built nearly 1.1 million engines last year at two British sites, Dagenham in east London and Bridgend in south Wales, which are then shipped to a number of other factories in countries such as Turkey and Germany to be fitted into vehicles. Anyone entering a Ford facility will need to wear a company-provided face mask and have their body temperature checked with work areas having been redesigned to make sure social distancing rules can be adhered to. “Our key priority is the implementation of Ford’s global standards on social distancing and strengthened health and safety protocols to safeguard the well-being of our workforce,” said Ford of Britain’s chairman Graham Hoare.

40.04024144869216," UAW paves way for U.S. auto factory restart after FCA reveals reopening plans DETROIT (Reuters) - The union that represents U.S. hourly workers at Detroit automakers gave its tacit approval on Tuesday for the companies to restart production amid the coronavirus pandemic, after Fiat Chrysler said it expected to reopen its North American plants on May 18. The United Auto Workers union has been negotiating with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) FCHA.MIFCAU.N, General Motors Co GM.N and Ford Motor Co F.N over how and when to safely restart U.S. production after widespread lockdowns aimed at curbing the spread of the novel coronavirus. “We continue to advocate for as much testing (for the disease) as possible at the current time and eventually full-testing when available,” UAW President Rory Gamble said in a statement. “As for the start date, the companies contractually make that decision and we all knew this day would come.” FCA said as it reported its first-quarter results that it expected to restart its North American operations on May 18. GM and Ford have not announced restart dates, but the Detroit companies want to resume production so they can start bringing in much-needed cash. U.S. automotive production ground to a halt in March as the number of cases of the novel coronavirus jumped. But with President Donald Trump pushing for Americans to get back to work and several U.S. states reopening their economies, the focus in the auto sector has shifted to when production can safely restart. Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer previously extended the state’s stay-at-home order through May 15, but lifted restrictions for some businesses other than manufacturing. Neighboring Ohio allowed manufacturing to resume on Monday, and Whitmer is facing increasing calls to follow suit. Tesla Inc TSLA.O Chief Executive Elon Musk was highly critical last week of the various states' stay-at-home orders, which have idled the electric carmaker's California plant. He called the policies ""fascist."" Ford said on Tuesday it had not determined when to restart North American production. “We are continuing to assess public health conditions, government guidelines and supplier readiness to determine when the time is right to resume production,” Ford spokeswoman Kelli Felker said in an email. Last week, Ford outlined the safety measures it will institute to restart its U.S. plants and said getting clearance from Michigan would be the last step. GM and FCA have instituted similar measures at their plants. GM officials could not immediately be reached to comment. Gamble, who had previously said early May was “too soon and too risky” to resume production, said his own family would be among those reporting to plants. His previous rule for automakers was asking whether they felt it was safe enough to send their own family members into plants. Ford Chief Operating Officer Jim Farley said last week he would “absolutely” be comfortable having his family working at a Ford plant, given the steps taken to ensure employee safety. “We must implement and follow these guidelines and self-reporting procedures we have worked out,” Gamble said on Tuesday, referring to guidelines on worker health and safety. “And the UAW will fulfill its role to continue to actively monitor and aggressively respond regarding all issues impacting the health and safety of UAW members in whatever manner may be necessary as we return to the worksite.”"
41.15226337448559," Carmakers Dacia and Ford resume production in Romania BUCHAREST (Reuters) - Romanian carmaker Dacia, owned by France's Renault RENA.PA and Ford Motor Co's F.N Craiova plant resumed operations on Monday after output was halted due to the coronavirus pandemic in March, they said. Dacia has sent around 14,000 employees home on technical unemployment and Ford also suspended activity for its 6,000 staff. During the shutdown, both plants implemented safety measures aimed at curbing the risk of COVID-19 infections and to ensure their employees are protected against the new coronavirus. Ford said it will gradually resume output in a single shift with about half of its workers. Dacia said that “production on the Mioveni industrial platform has been resumed, with the Mechanical and Chassis Plant working in three shifts.” The European Union member state, which has recorded 13,512 coronavirus infections and 803 deaths, declared a 30-day state of emergency on March 16 and later extended it to May 15."

32.41650294695482," Ford wants to restart U.S. car plants shut by coronavirus, if it can convince union DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co F.N on Thursday outlined the safety measures it will institute to restart its most profitable U.S. plants amid the coronavirus pandemic, expanding on similar efforts by General Motors Co GM.N and Fiat Chrysler FCHA.MIFCAU.N to convince leaders of the United Auto Workers union to send members back to work. The UAW so far has not agreed to endorse reopening U.S. auto plants, even as workers in Europe and Asia are going back to their jobs. Virtually all U.S. automotive production ground to a halt in March as the number of COVID-19 infections grew rapidly. Billions of dollars in revenue and profits are riding on how quickly Ford and its U.S. rivals can convince the UAW and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer that it is safe to return to work. The UAW declared that early May was too soon to reopen, and since then has not agreed to a date. Without Michigan, the Detroit Three and other automakers operating in the United States cannot build vehicles. Ford executives highlighted that the U.S. auto sector accounts for 6% of U.S. economic output. Ford has the largest unionized workforce in the United States with about 56,000 UAW members. The F-series pickup trucks UAW workers build account for $50 billion in annual revenue, Ford said. “It’s just really now getting the clarity from our government leaders because we’re ready,” Ford Chief Operating Officer Jim Farley said on a conference call with reporters. Farley added he would “absolutely” be comfortable having his family work in a Ford plant given the steps the company has taken to ensure employee safety. UAW President Rory Gamble said the union is negotiating with the Detroit automakers about safely reopening their U.S. plants. Among the issues on the table are what types of protective gear workers should have, how fast assembly lines should move and how much testing should be done. “The UAW is asking for as much testing as is possible to prevent exposure to the virus,” Gamble said in a Thursday statement. Ford’s human resources chief Kiersten Robinson said the automaker will not have a “reliable and scalable testing solution” for COVID-19 for several weeks if not months and the company was forming a task force to see how it can move faster to achieve that. “Longer term, we think it will be critical,” she said. “Hopefully, in coming weeks or months, it will be part of our protocol.” Ford manufacturing chief Gary Johnson said any worker who worried they had been exposed would be sent to a hospital for testing and the UAW had agreed to that process. Johnson said the company was not planning to provide workers with N95 respiratory masks, which are designed to filter 95% of airborne particles, as the regular face masks and shields were good enough. Slowing the speed of production lines in plants would be too complex, he added. Some union leaders have suggested lines could be slowed to allow for greater physical separation between workers. What Ford will do in its plants is no-touch doors, require use of personal protective equipment like face masks and shields, install barriers where employees must work closely together, use thermal scanning to screen employees for fevers and do heavy sanitizing of work areas. Ford executives said they have been using the same safety protocols already in China, where production restarted in late February. The Dearborn, Michigan-based company did not provide a date for restarting U.S. factories. Ford did say white-collar workers would likely return to their offices in late June or early July. Officials in Whitmer’s office could not immediately be reached to comment on Thursday. She extended the state’s stay-at-home order through May 15 but has lifted restrictions for some businesses other than manufacturing. Neighboring Ohio is allowing manufacturing to resume on Monday. In its restart playbook, GM’s strategy relies heavily on many of the same approaches as Ford, but does not address assembly line workstations. The No. 1 U.S. automaker has not provided a target for a U.S. restart. FCA has retreated from its plan to restart North American operations on May 3 given Michigan's extended stay-at-home order. It is using similar measures to Ford. Tesla Inc TSLA.O Chief Executive Elon Musk was highly critical on Wednesday of the various states' stay-at-home orders, which have idled the electric carmaker's California plant. He called the policies ""fascist."""
31.558935361216733," Breakingviews - Corona Capital: U.S. GDP, Gilead’s drug, Spotify NEW YORK/LONDON/HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - Corona Capital is a daily column updated throughout the day by Breakingviews columnists around the world with short, sharp pandemic-related insights. - U.S. gross domestic plunge - Gilead’s remdesivir hope - Spotify keeps the volume up GROSS DOMESTIC PLUNGE. Wednesday’s early estimate for first-quarter U.S. GDP showed a 4.8% annualized decline. With coronavirus-related shutdowns torpedoing consumption and other economic activity only in late March, that’s still partly guesswork – as were economists’ forecasts, which ranged from 1% growth to a 15% rate of shrinkage, according to a Reuters poll. More predictable is that the second quarter will look much worse. There’s something for the V-shaped recovery optimists in the report, however. Inventories declined for the fourth straight quarter. In normal times, at least, that’s a bit like tensioning a spring for a bounce because depleted stocks have to be replenished. Then again, there’s a reminder that business investment, a sign of confidence in the future, was slipping for three quarters even before the appearance of Covid-19. Reopening is unfortunately no guarantee of rebounding. (By Richard Beales) EVERY LITTLE HELPS. The world desperately needs a drug to treat Covid-19, and it looks like it has one. That doesn’t necessarily mean it’s a great one. Gilead Sciences’ remdesivir speeds up the recovery of advanced patients, according to a National Institutes of Health study. That was enough to add $6 billion to the biotechnology company’s value and help send the S&P 500 Index up 3% on Wednesday. Faster recoveries would help overtaxed hospital systems, thereby also helping doctors and patients. Yet there was only a hint, but no proof, of reduced mortality with Gilead’s treatment. Even so, the drug should receive regulatory approval in record time – it was probably the best therapeutic already lying on the shelf. Though it’s a positive start, it’s hardly the harbinger of a return to normality. That will require better drugs, or a vaccine, which will take time. (By Robert Cyran) UPBEAT TUNES FOR DOWNBEAT TIMES. Shares of Spotify Technology jumped more than 10% on Wednesday after the streaming music service reported 31% year-over-year user growth for the first quarter. Despite Covid-19, Spotify’s forecast for the year remains mostly intact, too. The $29 billion firm relies largely on paid subscriptions and its executives noted an uptick in listeners through TVs and game consoles. Like people moving their banking online, that’s the kind of change that may emerge from the experience of lockdown. For now, it’s music to Spotify investors’ ears. (By Jennifer Saba) ZERO FOR HEROES. The Federal Reserve has flooded debt markets and borrowers with trillions of dollars to offset the economic impact of the coronavirus. In just weeks, the U.S. central bank’s balance sheet has ballooned to over $6.5 trillion, $2 trillion more than ever before. The Fed probably isn’t done yet. Interest rates, however, may have hit a limit. Chair Jay Powell and his colleagues cut the low end of their target rate range to zero back on March 15. They don’t subscribe to negative rates – yet – but certainly won’t raise them again in Wednesday’s policy announcement. More surprising is that according to a nifty tool from the CME, Fedwatch, traders have 100% confidence that rates are stuck at zero for at least seven more scheduled meetings, or nearly a year. That may suggest pessimism about the post-viral recovery – or simply underscore how high the bar has become for the Fed to raise rates under any circumstances, leave alone the present ones. (By Richard Beales) GE’S ROUND NUMBER. Covid-19 cost General Electric $1 billion of cash flow in the first quarter of 2020. And things weren’t going swimmingly before the pandemic hit. The U.S. conglomerate burned $2 billion of cash in total in the quarter, frustrating GE’s plans to cut back its mountainous borrowings. Chief Executive Larry Culp had already ditched the company’s near-term targets. But his plans remain somewhat vague, and the pandemic is far from over. He told investors on Wednesday that GE is making cuts to conserve cash, and “redefining winning.” Unless he can redefine “debt” as well, he needs to come up with something punchier. (By John Foley) THE RESTRUCTURING’S IN THE MAIL. Jim Hackett is making the right noises. After confirming on Tuesday that the global pandemic caused a $2 billion loss last quarter, Ford Motor’s boss trotted out the “don’t waste the crisis” mantra, saying there’s “no grace period for transforming Ford.” Trouble is, the Covid-19-induced global production shutdown is putting the brakes on an already slow-moving, multi-year effort to slash expenses. Ford’s restructuring plan requires spending $7 billion in cash, now a precious commodity. The car company wasn’t even a fifth of the way through that at the end of 2019 and is now paring back this year’s plans a tad. That’ll make it harder for Ford to compete once the crisis passes – not least on electric and self-driving cars. Hackett is trying to persuade investors that they shouldn’t read anything into the relative lack of action today. But that’s a tough circle to square. (By Antony Currie) DRUG MONEY. AstraZeneca’s results have put rebel investors on the defensive. The $134 billion drugmaker said on Wednesday total sales in the first quarter were up 17% to $6.3 billion. Analysts had only been expecting product sales of $5.9 billion. The figures should be a relief to Chief Executive Pascal Soriot as he meets shareholders at the company’s annual meeting. A Sky News report earlier this month suggested investors were preparing to vote against his pay package. Pension perks are the root of the problem. The board has already cut Soriot’s pension contribution to 20% of his 1.3 million-pound salary, from 30%. But it still far exceeds the retirement awards paid to AstraZeneca staff. BlackRock, the company’s largest shareholder, has previously warned it will vote against the compensation of any CEO whose retirement awards that are out of line with workers. But Soriot’s delivery of seven consecutive quarters of sales growth should allow him to shrug off any rebellion. (By Aimee Donnellan) HONG STRONG. Banks everywhere are cranking up bad debt charges due to the pandemic-induced slowdown. Yet Hong Kong looks a financial safe haven, despite being one of the first places outside mainland China to impose a lockdown. Standard Chartered on Wednesday said that first-quarter pre-tax profit in the special administrative region was broadly unchanged from the previous three months, at $378 million, even though bad debt charges almost doubled. Larger rival HSBC, a day earlier reported pre-tax profit of $2.85 billion in Hong Kong, up 9% from the previous quarter. What’s going on? Hong Kong has so far been successful in containing the Covid-19 outbreak. The government is supporting consumers and companies, though its biggest support package only came earlier this month. And Hong Kong banks started raising bad debt charges last year, as violent protests kept visitors away from the financial hub. The global slump will squeeze its economy, which is dependent on tourism and finance. So far, however, Hong Kong’s financial system is holding up. (By Peter Thal Larsen) UPHILL START. The gears are crunching badly at Daimler and Volkswagen. First-quarter operating profit at the two German automakers fell by roughly four-fifths year-on-year, the pair reported on Wednesday. But China offers a crumb of comfort. Daimler said April unit sales in the country were 97% of the comparable figure a year earlier, up from just 29% in March. And footfall in the company’s dealerships was already back at levels seen in January before an economic lockdown was initiated. Volkswagen, meanwhile, said it expected China car sales would by July match 2019 trends. Any resurgence would benefit VW more than Daimler. China accounts for around two-fifths of group sales at the Wolfsburg-based company, versus one-tenth at the Mercedes-Benz maker. That may be why boss Herbert Diess still expects VW to report an operating profit in 2020, albeit “severely” below the prior year. Something is better than nothing. (By Christopher Thompson) FACE-SAVING MOVE. Chinese electric-car maker BYD unveiled terrible results late on Tuesday, but it was surprisingly chipper about the months to come. The $20 billion company, which reported an 85% decline in quarterly net profit from a year earlier, expects the first-half bottom line to increase by as much as 24% once the April to June period is included. Amid a depressed market for vehicle sales, handset assembly will power some of the growth. Another unlikely source: surgical face masks. It took less than two weeks for Shenzhen-based BYD to set up the new manufacturing process. By mid-March, the plant was running at full capacity churning out 5 million masks and 300,000 bottles of disinfectant daily. The likes of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and General Motors also have shifted gears into making protective and medical equipment. Given some of the virus-induced societal changes in the offing, this might be a form of diversification that pays longer-term dividends. (By Sharon Lam) CROSSED WIRES. The usual path for an activist investor harbouring a beef with a company is to get on its share register, build a stake and lobby for management to get the boot. Chris Hohn is offering an interesting variation. The head of $24 billion TCI Fund Management has a 1.04% short position in Wirecard’s shares, and is demanding the exit of Chief Executive Markus Braun, who also holds 7% of the German payments group. A short-seller might want an underperforming boss to stay in post. Either way, it keeps the spotlight on Wirecard. The group’s shares fell on Tuesday after auditor KPMG found no evidence of “balance sheet forgery” but added big caveats such as an unwillingness to cooperate by Wirecard’s third-party partners. Those businesses were central to allegations of suspect accounting made by the Financial Times, which Wirecard has always denied. With shares off another 7% on Wednesday, greater transparency might be needed. Hohn’s odd activism helps maintain the pressure for more light. (By George Hay)"
30.297397769516728," Ford expects $5 billion loss in current quarter as coronavirus hits demand DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co F.N said on Tuesday its second-quarter loss would more than double to over $5 billion from $2 billion in the first quarter due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, but added it had enough money despite the crisis to last the rest of 2020. “We believe the company’s cash is sufficient to take us through the end of the year, even with no additional vehicle wholesales or financing actions,” Chief Financial Officer Tim Stone said in a statement. But he called the current economic environment “too ambiguous” for the No. 2 U.S. automaker to give a full-year 2020 earnings forecast. “There’s no denying the negative economic consequences of a pandemic,” Chief Executive Jim Hackett said on a conference call with analysts. The Dearborn, Michigan-based company has slashed costs during the COVID-19 outbreak to weather the shutdown, including cutting salaries of executives and white-collar employees. Ford also moved to cut spending on projects, saying on Tuesday it was pushing back its commercial autonomous vehicle services by a year to 2022 and that it had decided not to develop a previously announced luxury electric Lincoln sport utility vehicle in partnership with electric vehicle maker Rivian. Ford shares were down more than 4.6% in after-hours trading on Tuesday after closing the regular session at $5.38. Ford’s market value of $20.6 billion is now less than the $35 billion in cash it had on hand as of last Friday, an indication that investors expect the company to burn through significant amounts of cash before a recovery takes hold. Ford had preannounced the pandemic-fueled first-quarter loss earlier this month. That warning came the same day the company raised $8 billion from corporate debt investors. Last month, Ford moved to hoard cash on its balance sheet, drawing down $15.4 billion from two credit lines and suspending its dividend, in a move to bolster reserves to ride out damage to its business. ‘AS SOON AS PRACTICABLE’ Virtually all U.S. automotive production ground to a halt in March as the number of COVID-19 infections grew rapidly. But with President Donald Trump pushing for Americans to get back to work and several U.S. states beginning to reopen their economies, the focus in the auto sector has shifted to when production can be restarted. In an earlier conference call with reporters, Stone, the CFO, said the company would restart U.S. production “as soon as practicable,” but did not give a timeline. Ford’s captive finance arm posted $30 million in first-quarter pretax earnings, down $771 million from a year ago. That included $600 million in additional-loss reserves, plus higher depreciation of former lease vehicle sales and expected lease defaults – in preparation for the estimated future impact of the coronavirus on the finance unit’s performance. Ford, General Motors Co GM.N and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) FCHA.MIFCAU.N are aiming to resume production some time in May, and are negotiating with the United Auto Workers (UAW) union, which represents their U.S. hourly workers, about how to safely resume vehicle production. FCA and GM are scheduled to report quarterly results on May 5 and 6, respectively. Last week, the UAW said it was “too soon and too risky” to reopen auto plants in early May. Ford, whose credit rating has been downgraded to “junk” status by Standard & Poor’s, said previously it hoped to resume production in April at plants that make its most profitable vehicles, but subsequently backed off those plans. Ford said on Tuesday it would restart most of its European manufacturing starting next Monday. It has already resumed operations in China, where the pandemic began and where sales fell 35% in the first quarter. U.S. sales fell 12.5%. Once North American production resumes, the question will be how fast U.S. demand bounces back. Ford said it expected to spend $700 million to $1.2 billion on its global restructuring this year, but executives said the automaker was looking at additional actions."
30.297397769516728," Ford investors keen for details on when automaker will restart U.S. operations DETROIT, April 28 (Reuters) - Investors already know how the coronavirus outbreak has hurt Ford Motor Co’s bottom line, so when the automaker releases first-quarter results on Tuesday they will focus on how and when Ford plans to restart North American operations. Ford said on April 17 that the outbreak would result in an estimated first-quarter loss of about $2 billion. That warning came the same day the Dearborn, Michigan-based company raised $8 billion from corporate debt investors. Last month, Ford moved to hoard cash on its balance sheet, drawing down $15.4 billion from two credit lines and suspending its dividend, in a move to bolster reserves to ride out damage to its business. It also abandoned its 2020 financial forecast. Virtually all U.S. automotive production ground to a halt in March as the number of COVID-19 infections grew rapidly.

Ford, whose credit rating has been downgraded to “junk” status by Standard & Poor’s, has not said when it plans to reopen in North America. It previously had hoped to resume production in April at plants that make its most profitable vehicles, but subsequently backed off those plans. Ford has idled most of its European plants until May 4, but has resumed operations in China, where the pandemic began and where sales fell 35% in the first quarter. U.S. sales fell 12.5%. Prior to the bond deal, Ford told investors that absent new funding and a restart of production, it had cash to last until the end of the third quarter. It also said revenue in the first quarter would finish at about $34 billion. Ford also warned that production of high-priced versions of pickups and SUVs could be hurt due to damage caused by a tornado at parts supplier BorgWarner Inc’s South Carolina factory. That facility makes transfer cases for some of Ford’s most profitable vehicles, such as four wheel-drive large F-series pickups and large SUVs. Once production resumes, the question will be how fast U.S. demand bounces back. Earlier in April, Ford’s U.S. sales chief, Mark LaNeve, told Reuters the automaker believed some level of government stimulus for the U.S. auto sector will be needed for consumers once the pandemic recedes. During the Great Recession of 2008-09, the U.S. government rolled out a “cash for clunkers” program, which offered consumers rebates of up to $4,500 to trade in older gas guzzlers.

Michigan Governor Whitmer is yet to provide details on restarting the state’s crucial manufacturing sector and has said she would be “guided by data, not artificial timelines.” The companies are working with the union on drawing up safety protocols for reducing exposure risk for workers, but haven’t finalized those terms yet, according to the WSJ report.

32.81249999999999," Ford issues $8 billion debt securities after virus causes $2 billion loss (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co F.N on Friday raised $8 billion from corporate debt investors to shore up its cash reserves as the coronavirus outbreak pummeled vehicle sales and production, resulting in an estimated loss of about $2 billion for the first quarter. The Dearborn, Michigan-based company, which lost its investment-grade status in March, raised new funds with a three-part debt offering, according to a regulatory filing. Investors said Ford benefited from the U.S. Federal Reserve’s move last week to backstop debt offerings by companies that lost investment-grade credit ratings after the COVID-19 crisis accelerated in the United States, International Financing Review reported on Friday. “Today’s deal is a good sign of the growing confidence around the improving market backdrop with respect to liquidity as well as more promising views around the economic outlook,” said Dan Mead, head of investment grade syndicate at Bank of America Securities, which was one of the lead banks on the Ford deal. In an environment where interest rates on cash savings are close to zero, Ford will pay investors interest of between 8.50% and 9.625% on the new debt securities. There was around $40 billion worth of demand from investors across the three debt packages, according to a person familiar with the matter. Ford had earlier drawn down over $15 billion from revolving credit lines to ride out the pandemic, which forced the shutdown of its North American and European factories during the past month. Separately, General Motors Co GM.N disclosed in a regulatory filing that it had entered into a 364-day revolving credit agreement of $1.95 billion. The automaker said it has allocated the credit line for exclusive use by its financial services business. (bit.ly/3ezBDoy) Ford on Friday said it had to put up additional guarantees for earlier loans - not the notes sold Friday - because it has not maintained an investment-grade status. It has suspended its dividend for the quarter. Stanching the cash drain and restarting profitable operations in Europe and North America will be critical for Ford in the months ahead. The company told investors ahead of Friday’s bond deal that absent new funding and a restart of production, it had cash to last to the end of the third quarter. Now, Ford has more breathing room financially, and federal and state officials this week said they expect coronavirus lockdowns to begin easing, possibly allowing auto plants to begin building vehicles again early next month. Still, the company has taken a body blow from the pandemic at a time when it was already wrestling with a difficult restructuring effort begun more than two years ago. Ford’s vehicle sales to dealers fell 21% in the first quarter, compared with a year earlier. Only Ford’s joint ventures in China, where the pandemic has been receding, are currently producing vehicles, and dealers there have resumed work. Separately, Ford warned that its production of high-priced versions of pickups and sport utility vehicles could be hurt due to the damage caused by a tornado earlier this week at parts supplier BorgWarner's BWA.N South Carolina factory. BorgWarner’s facility makes transfer cases for some of Ford’s most profitable vehicles, such as four wheel-drive large F-series pickups and large sport utility vehicles.

The news sent Ford’s shares down more than 5% in morning trading. Only Ford’s joint ventures in China, where the COVID-19 pandemic has been receding, are currently producing vehicles. The automaker said it is working on a scenario for a phased restart of its manufacturing plants beginning in the second quarter. “However, we believe we have sufficient cash today to get us through at least the end of the third quarter with no incremental vehicle production and wholesales or financing actions,” Chief Financial Officer Tim Stone said in a statement. Asked whether Ford would apply for loans from the U.S. government or the Federal Reserve to sustain its operations for longer if needed, a spokesman for the automaker said that unlike during the Great Recession - when financing dried up - there is still plenty of liquidity in the capital markets. “We have a broad range of options” for obtaining additional financing if needed, the spokesman said. As of April 9, Ford said it had about $30 billion in cash on its balance sheet, including $15.4 billion it borrowed last month against two existing credit lines. Ford said any decisions on restarting its plants will be made “in cooperation with local unions, suppliers, dealers and other stakeholders.” In March, the company shuttered plants in North America and Europe due to the spreading pandemic. Earlier this month, the No. 2 U.S. automaker said its first-quarter U.S. sales had fallen 12.5% during the quarter.

38.76146788990824," Ford to build face shields at Brazil and Argentina car plants SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co F.N said on Thursday it will make 50,000 face shields at factories in Brazil and Argentina to donate in the fight against the coronavirus pandemic. The accelerating outbreak has triggered global shortages of protective equipment such as face shields, sending prices higher and forcing doctors to reuse old ones or go without them. Brazil’s government has struggled to buy additional medical supplies from China, as Health Minister Luiz Henrique Mandetta accused the United States of scooping up gear and leaving suppliers to cancel their contracts with Brazil. Ford said it is also helping with efforts in Brazil to fix old mechanical respirators, as part of a task force including several other manufacturers. Brazil has more coronavirus cases than any other country in Latin America, with almost 7,000 confirmed cases and 241 deaths."
38.76146788990824," Ford says post-crisis support for U.S. customers 'would be appropriate' (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co's F.N U.S. sales chief said on Thursday the automaker believes some level of government stimulus will be needed for consumers once the coronavirus pandemic recedes and that the crisis will spur a permanent shift toward more online vehicle sales in America. “It’s hard to determine how long and what the lingering effects of this will be,” Mark LaNeve told Reuters after the company reported lower quarterly sales as a result of the pandemic. “But certainly we believe that some level of government stimulus post crisis to help customers and the auto industry to recover would be appropriate.” The No. 2 U.S. automaker posted a 12.5% fall in U.S. auto sales for the first quarter. Government orders for businesses to shutter and consumers to remain at home in the face of the coronavirus pandemic stalled demand across the auto industry. Economists say the stay-at-home measures have pushed the economy into recession. The number of Americans filing claims for unemployment benefits last week shot to a record high of 6.65 million. During the Great Recession, the U.S. government rolled out a “cash-for-clunkers” program, which offered consumers rebates of up to $4,500 to trade in older gas guzzlers. Ford is currently “thinking over ideas” for government stimulus for consumers that it will discuss with its government affairs team, LaNeve said. He said around 93% of Ford’s 3,100 U.S. dealers are doing some or all aspects of sales online, from virtual tours to financing and home delivery, as the pandemic has shuttered showrooms in a growing number of states. “Good dealers have been doing remote delivery for the last 20 years, but it was maybe one a week,” he said. “Now they’re doing almost every delivery that way.” Ford is beefing up its existing online tools to support virtual sales through its dealers, and LaNeve said the coronavirus crisis will push more sales to the internet in the long term. “This has just turbo charged the adoption of those processes by both customers and the dealers,” LaNeve said. “To be honest, I think a big chunk of that stays with us even when we’re through the crisis.” Ford’s passenger car sales fell 36%, while sports utility vehicle sales dropped 11% in the first quarter. The company did not provide monthly sales figures, but estimated that industrywide U.S. new-vehicle sales fell 39% in March. LaNeve said Ford’s sales decline was lower than that."

25.87991718426501," Coronavirus concerns delay restart of Ford's North American production (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co F.N said on Tuesday it was postponing its plan to restart production at its North America plants due to safety concerns for its workers amid the coronavirus pandemic. To generate cash, the No. 2 U.S. automaker had said last week it was poised to restart production at some plants in North America as early as April 6, bringing back such profitable vehicles as its top-selling F-150 full-sized pickup, the Transit commercial van and SUVs. But on Tuesday, Ford said that although it had been aiming to resume production at several key U.S. plants on April 14, it would now do so at dates to be announced later on. “The health and safety of our workforce, dealers, customers, partners and communities remains our highest priority,” Kumar Galhotra, president of Ford’s North American operations, said in a statement. Still, the automaker will open a plant in Ypsilanti, Michigan, during the week of April 20, that will make ventilators to treat patients afflicted by the coronavirus. Michigan, which is home to a large portion of the U.S. automotive industry, has also become a hot spot in the pandemic. Schools and all but essential businesses have been ordered closed through at least April 13 to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Galhotra said Ford was working closely with the United Auto Workers union to “develop additional health and safety procedures” to help keep hourly workers healthy. “Today’s decision by Ford is the right decision for our members, their families and our nation,” UAW President Rory Gamble said in a statement. Rival Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCHA.MIFCAU.N said last week it plans to resume production in North America on April 13. A spokeswoman for FCA said the automaker was “continuing to monitor the situation.” General Motors Co GM.N has shuttered its plants indefinitely and has not provided a date for vehicle production to restart. “Once it is safe to resume production, we will do so,” a GM spokesman said."
25.87991718426501," Ford, GE to produce 50,000 ventilators in 100 days DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Monday it will produce 50,000 ventilators over the next 100 days at a plant in Michigan in cooperation with General Electric’s healthcare unit, and can then build 30,000 per month as needed to treat patients afflicted with the coronavirus. Ford said the simplified ventilator design, which is licensed by GE Healthcare from Florida-based Airon Corp and has been cleared by the Food and Drug Administration, can meet the needs of most COVID-19 patients and relies on air pressure without the need for electricity. Officials in states hard hit by the pandemic have pleaded with the Trump administration and manufacturers to speed up production of ventilators to cope with a surge in patients struggling to breathe. Hospitals in New York already are using one ventilator to sustain two patients. New Orleans has a fraction of the ventilators it needs for a surge of COVID-19 patients, Louisiana officials said. On Friday, President Donald Trump said he would invoke powers under the Defense Production Act to direct manufacturers, including Ford and General Motors Co, to produce ventilators. On Monday, the head of the United Auto Workers and other officials compared the auto industry’s effort to build ventilators to Detroit’s conversion to bomber production during the World War Two. Ford said it plans to begin production of ventilators at a plant in Ypsilanti, Michigan, deploying 500 United Auto Workers employees. It said it plans to start production at the facility the week of April 20. That is roughly when New York officials expect the peak of COVID-19 cases to hit their state. Ventilators built by Ford, GM and others could be used in other parts of the United States where the peak case loads are expected later. GM said Sunday it plans to produce up to 10,000 ventilators a month by this summer at a plant in Kokomo, Indiana. The Ypsilanti workers will be stationed at a safe distance apart and will be screened for symptoms of coronavirus infection before they enter the plant, Ford officials said. “We’re using and deploying a whole host of technologies to keep workers safe,” said Adrian Price, director of global manufacturing core engineering for Ford. The safety procedures will be adapted from work Ford and the UAW have been doing to prepare for the automaker to reopen other U.S. factories, Price said. Separately, GE and Ford engineers are working together to boost production at a GE plant in Madison, Wisconsin, of a GE ventilator, different from the model licensed from Airon. GE expects to double ventilator output from the Wisconsin plant during the second quarter, Tom Westrick, GE Healthcare’s vice president for quality, said during a call with reporters on Monday."

12.571428571428575," U.S. carmakers move to shore up cash, Ford to restart some plants DETROIT (Reuters) - The two largest U.S. automakers on Thursday announced measures to shore up their finances as the coronavirus pandemic takes a deep economic bite, with Ford Motor Co F.N aiming to resume production next month of its most profitable vehicles while cutting costs further. General Motors Co GM.N, the No. 1 U.S. automaker, said it planned to keep its plants closed indefinitely and was reducing the pay of salaried employees and executives and suspending some future product programs to conserve cash. GM’s chief executive and chief financial officer issued a stark warning to company employees in an internal video, saying that “significant austerity measures” were needed to preserve the company’s long-term viability. To generate cash, Ford said it was poised to restart production at some plants in North America as early as April 6, bringing back such profitable vehicles as its top-selling F-150 full-sized pickup, the Transit commercial van and SUVs. The plants that produce those vehicles are located in the U.S. states of Michigan and Kentucky and in Mexico. To save cash, Ford said it was temporarily cutting top executives’ salaries, among other actions. This came a day after Standard & Poor’s downgraded the Dearborn, Michigan-based company’s debt to “junk” status and warned more downgrades could be necessary. “The actions we’re taking now are wide-ranging and substantial,” Ford’s chief executive, Jim Hackett, told employees in an email early on Thursday. “We hope they will be enough to give Ford the financial flexibility to ride out the economic and business effects of the coronavirus.” The pandemic, which has killed more than 21,000 people globally, has forced the shutdown of auto plants around the world as entire cities have gone into lockdown to stem the spread of the virus. Ford previously drew down credit lines to build its cash position and suspended its dividend. GM also drew down its credit line, but did not suspend the dividend. The U.S. Senate on Wednesday passed a $2 trillion economic rescue package to help unemployed workers and companies, including the auto industry, hit hard by the outbreak. The measure has been sent to the House of Representatives for a vote on Friday. President Donald Trump, concerned about the economic repercussions of an extended shutdown, has said he wants America to get back to business by Easter, which is April 12. To get more cash coming in, Ford said it would restart key plants, while introducing additional safety measures to protect returning workers from the coronavirus. It said it would provide details on the new measures later. To conserve cash, Ford said its top 300 executives would defer 20% to 50% of salaries for at least five months starting May 1, with the executive chairman deferring his entire salary. Hackett will defer half his salary. However, Ford employees will continue to get healthcare coverage and those exposed to the virus and placed in quarantine will get paid time off, he added. General Motors Co GM.N and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) FCHA.MIFCAU.N previously said they would shut their North American operations through March 30 and reassess after that. FCA on Thursday extended its shutdown through April 13, while its parts distribution centers will continue to operate with paid volunteers. Mexico’s status is subject to a separate announcement. GM on Thursday extended its shutdown indefinitely and said it would evaluate on a week-to-week basis. GM’s chief executive, Mary Barra, and chief financial officer, Dhivya Suryadevara, told company employees in the internal video, which Reuters heard a recording of, that it was essential that GM take immediate, aggressive steps to cut costs. “If we don’t take significant austerity measures, we will do serious damage to the long-term viability of our company,” Suryadevara said. She noted that GM has very little revenue coming in “and we are preparing to operate the company temporarily on credit if necessary.” Barra said GM was “aggressively taking costs out of the business,” including cutting its marketing budget ”and hundreds of other actions.” To save cash and avoid layoffs, the automaker said salaried employees would have 20% of their pay deferred, executives 25% and senior leaders 30%, starting April 1. GM said the deferred money would be repaid in a lump sum no later than March 15, 2021. Health-care benefits are not affected. GM also said 6,500 salaried employees, mostly in manufacturing and engineering, who are not able to work remotely are being paid 75% of their salary as part of a “downtime paid absence” program in lieu of collecting unemployment benefits. In an email to employees on Thursday, seen by Reuters, Barra said GM for years has been making “difficult decisions to strengthen our business and make it more resilient,” and now those moves “will be put to the test.” United Auto Workers President Rory Gamble said Thursday the union viewed announcements like Ford’s with concern, and any decision to restart production should be based on data and each state’s position with regards to the coronavirus outbreak. The UAW has said three union members who worked at FCA plants have died due to the coronavirus. Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer issued an order on Monday barring non-essential businesses from operating until April 13. Ford plans to begin production on one shift at its Hermosillo, Mexico, assembly plant, where it builds the Ford Fusion and Lincoln MKZ sedans. It will restart production on April 14 at its Dearborn plant that builds the F-150 and a Kentucky plant that makes the Super Duty version of the pickup as well as the Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator SUVs.

12.571428571428575," Detroit's near future based on SUVs, not EVs, production plans show DETROIT (Reuters) - General Motors Co GM.N and Ford Motor Co F.N have widely touted their commitment to emission-free electric cars, but their production plans show a growing reliance on ever-larger gas-powered vehicles. The two biggest U.S. automakers will make more than 5 million SUVs and pickup trucks in 2026, but only about 320,000 electric vehicles, according to detailed production plans for North America seen by Reuters. That will be about 5% of their combined vehicle production in North America, but less than Tesla Inc TSLA.O, the world leader in electric vehicles, produced last year. The plans show that Detroit’s Big Two are betting their short-term future on satisfying America’s demand for bigger, petroleum-fueled vehicles which they can sell at a higher profit margin than mostly smaller, expensive-to-develop electric vehicles. Large SUVs consume about a quarter more energy than midsize cars, meaning the plans will most likely wipe out any gains in overall fuel efficiency or reduction in auto emissions that were targeted over the next six years, according to industry experts. The recent collapse of oil prices - pointing toward cheap gas for the foreseeable future - and a dip in demand caused by the coronavirus may only serve to strengthen automakers’ commitment to the strategy. Detroit has tried to latch onto the consumer and investor excitement over electric vehicles made by Tesla, whose market value is double that of GM and Ford combined, even though its sales are much smaller. GM executives have been repeating a “zero emissions” mantra since 2017, and the company’s website features a prominent commitment to its “all-electric future.” Ford’s Executive Chairman Bill Ford told the Detroit auto show two years ago: “We’re all in on this. We’re taking our mainstream vehicles, our most iconic vehicles, and we’re electrifying them.” But it is hard to detect a major change of direction from the companies’ production plans. According to data from AutoForecast Solutions seen by Reuters, North American production of SUV models by GM and Ford will outpace production of traditional cars by more than eight to one in 2026, and 93% of those SUVs are expected to be gas-fueled. The data has not previously been reported. AutoForecast’s data is based on planning information provided to suppliers by the automakers, and is widely used across the industry. GM and Ford executives interviewed by Reuters did not dispute the accuracy of the data. “GM and Ford understand that buyers want more SUVs and trucks, but they’re also trying to play to Wall Street, which thinks the future is all about electric vehicles,” said Sam Fiorani, vice president, global vehicle forecasting at AutoForecast. “The Detroit automakers would love to get a little of that Tesla magic and money.” ‘DON’T VIOLATE THE LAWS OF ECONOMICS’ Internal production plans from other industry sources seen by Reuters support AutoForecast’s numbers, which show GM and Ford expect to produce about 320,000 pure electric vehicles - powered solely by a battery - in North America in 2026. That is nearly 10 times the 35,000 they have planned to build in 2020, but fewer than the 367,500 Tesla delivered last year. It is only a fraction of the 5.2 million SUVs and pickups that GM and Ford expect to make in North America in 2026, according to the AutoForecast data, up 14% from 4.6 million SUVs and pickups in 2019. SUVs and pickups will account for about 87% of vehicles made by GM and Ford in the region in 2026, compared with about 82% last year. Executives at GM and Ford told Reuters in interviews they are serious about launching more electric vehicles in the United States in the coming years, but they are concerned about getting too far ahead of mass-market demand. “We’re trying to time this with the natural demand of consumers (so) we’re not forced to do artificial things and we don’t violate the laws of economics,” Hau Thai-Tang, Ford’s chief product development and purchasing officer, told Reuters. GM Chief Executive Mary Barra said in early March the company planned to spend $20 billion to bring a million electric vehicles a year to market by the middle of the 2020s. A majority of those are expected to be built and sold in China, where a government mandate calls for increasing numbers of electric vehicles. “We want to meet customer demand with the best possible (carbon) footprint on the planet to help improve the CO2 (carbon dioxide) situation,” said Doug Parks, GM’s executive vice president of global product development, purchasing and supply chain, regarding GM’s production plans for SUVs and electric vehicles in North America. Read a summary of GM and Ford’s electric-vehicle plans here. The long-term battle between electrons and petroleum to be the primary energy source for future transportation took an unexpected turn with a crash in oil this month that sent fuel-pump prices to 20-year lows, with no signs of rising, making the cost of running internal combustion vehicles even more attractive to buyers. The spread of the coronavirus will put more financial pressure on automakers, according to analysts, limiting their capacity to develop and build money-losing vehicles. A global recession triggered by the epidemic “could add strain to balance sheets and ability to fund aggressive technology shifts,” said Morgan Stanley auto analyst Adam Jonas. In such an environment, automakers are not looking to depart from their winning formula. They make more profit on each luxury SUV - such as GM’s $80,000 Cadillac Escalade or Ford’s $76,000 Lincoln Navigator - than they do on a dozen compact cars, according to analysts. Because of that, automakers are replacing compact sedans with small SUVs that share many of the car’s mechanical parts, but sell for more. Ford discontinued the Focus compact sedan in the United States, which gets 31 miles per gallon of gas. Ford customers who want a similar-sized vehicle now can buy a 26 miles-per-gallon Ford Escape compact SUV, whose starting price is $6,000 higher. That may be good for automakers’ finances, but probably not for the environment. SUVs and pickups burn more fuel and emit more carbon dioxide than comparable sedans, and those with larger “footprints,” - the area between the points where the wheels touch the ground - are subject to looser emissions standards. Meanwhile, the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump is threatening to roll back tougher fuel economy and emissions standards proposed by his predecessor, Barack Obama, removing an incentive for automakers to make more fuel-efficient vehicles. That all indicates that any overall reduction in greenhouse gas emissions enabled by new electric vehicles will be largely, or entirely, offset by the continued substitution of gasoline-fueled SUVs for cars, experts say. The International Energy Agency (IEA) warned of this outcome in October, in a report that showed growing demand for SUVs across the world was the second-largest contributor to the increase in global carbon dioxide emissions from 2010 to 2018. “If consumers’ appetite for SUVs continues to grow at a similar pace seen in the last decade, SUVs would add nearly 2 million barrels a day in global oil demand by 2040, offsetting the savings from nearly 150 million electric cars,” said the IEA report. The IEA declined to comment on this story. The Obama White House predicted that doubling average car and truck fuel efficiency from 2011 to 2025 would cut greenhouse gas emissions by 6 billion tons. That does not look likely to happen. Trump’s White House is planning to follow through on its plan to roll back the Obama rules by the end of March, administration officials have told Reuters. The Environmental Protection Agency, which regulates U.S. auto emissions, did not respond to a request for comment."
12.571428571428575," Factbox: Ford and General Motors' electric vehicle plans (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co F.N and General Motors Co GM.N, the top two U.S. automakers, have more than two dozen new battery electric vehicles (EVs) in the pipeline, according to their executives and suppliers familiar with the companies' plans. Their combined production in North America is expected to total 325,000 in 2026, according to data from AutoForecast Solutions. That will represent about 5% of their total North American production and less than Tesla Inc TSLA.O, the world leader in electric vehicles, produced last year. Here is a detailed look at Ford and GM’s plans for future electric vehicles: Ford has said it will introduce the Mustang Mach-E, a battery-powered crossover with sports car styling, later this year, as well as an all-electric version of its best-selling F-150 pickup in 2021. Also on tap next year: An electric edition of the full-size Transit van, the company said. Ford also has confirmed plans to build a luxury Lincoln crossover on a battery-powered platform provided by Rivian, the Michigan-based electric vehicle startup that is also supplying Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O. The big Lincoln is due in 2022, according to suppliers. The automaker also has plans to introduce two new midsize electric crossovers, one each for the Ford and Lincoln brands, in 2023, suppliers said. GM has revealed one of its future EVs — the Cruise Origin self-driving shuttle — and shared details in early March with analysts and media of 13 other future EVs for the Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet and GMC brands. Suppliers familiar with GM’s plans have shared additional details. Buick is planning to introduce a midsize crossover and a companion SUV in 2023, the automaker said. It also expects to launch a compact crossover about the same time, according to suppliers. Cadillac showed off three upcoming EVs — the Lyriq midsize crossover, the Celestiq luxury sedan and a large, unnamed SUV about the size and shape of its Escalade. The crossover and SUV are likely to arrive in 2023, while the big sedan could be pulled forward to 2022, suppliers said. Two other crossovers, a compact model about the size of the XT4 and a large seven-passenger model about the size of the XT6, are due in 2024, GM said. Chevrolet said a facelifted Bolt EV and a slightly larger model, the Bolt EUV, will go into production next year. The next-generation Bolt is due in 2023. GM displayed a midsize Chevrolet SUV, due in 2023, that will be joined a year later by a compact crossover, according to suppliers. GM has said a full-size electric pickup is just around the bend — 2023, suppliers said. The GMC brand is getting a new sub-brand — Hummer — on two electric models, a large pickup truck and a slightly smaller SUV, GM has said, the former in late 2021, the latter in early 2023. Look also for a 1,000-horsepower performance variant of the Hummer pickup in 2022, which GM has teased. GMC also expects to get compact and midsize electric crossovers in 2025, according to suppliers. Ford and GM have provided few details of where their electric vehicles will be made. Production in North America will be spread among six plants, according to research firm AutoForecast Solutions, which monitors automakers’ plans. Ford will run four plants, including two in Mexico, where electric and gas-engine vehicles will be built under the same roof. GM will run two dedicated EV plants, both in Michigan. In comparison, the two companies expect to build nearly 40 different trucks and SUVs in North America, most of them powered by gas engines, in 2026. GM and Ford are expected to build more than 5 million trucks and SUVs in at least 25 plants in North America by mid-decade, according to AutoForecast data."

20.2020202020202," Ford joins GE, 3M in speeding up ventilator, respirator production (Reuters) - Carmaker Ford Motor Co F.N on Tuesday jumped into the emergency push by major U.S. manufacturers to produce thousands of ventilators and respirators needed to help combat the spread of the coronavirus under a partnership code-named ""Project Apollo."" By joining forces with General Electric's GE.N healthcare unit and 3M Co MMM.N, Ford is taking heed of U.S. President Donald Trump's call for U.S. automakers to work across sectors in producing equipment needed for the pandemic. The rapid outbreak, which has killed more than 16,500 people globally, has strained healthcare systems around the world and led to a shortage of ventilators needed to treat patients suffering from the flu-like illness, which can lead to breathing difficulties and pneumonia in severe cases. “We’ve been in regular dialogue with federal, state and local officials to understand the areas of greatest needs,” Ford Chief Executive Jim Hackett said. Ford said its partnerships were code-named “Project Apollo” after the Apollo 13 launch in 1970 when a lunar landing was aborted after an oxygen tank failed two days into the mission, forcing the astronauts to improvise a fix. Ford and GE Healthcare will expand the production of GE’s ventilator design to support patients with respiratory failure or difficulty breathing caused by the pathogen. In addition, they are developing a simplified design that Ford could begin making at one of its plants. The plan is to get the new design approved quickly by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Tom Westrick, vice president and chief quality officer at GE Healthcare, said on a conference call. Ford also is evaluating a separate effort not involving GE with the British government to make additional ventilators. Hackett told CNN he believes the industry can produce “hundreds of thousands” of ventilators by early to mid-May. “There’s no higher sense of urgency.” Ford on Tuesday extended the shutdown of its North American plants beyond March 30 as originally planned, but a spokesman said the healthcare-related efforts are separate and continuing. Separately, Ford will work with 3M to increase manufacturing capacity of its air-purifying respirators by up to a factor of 10 to meet a surge in demand for first responders and healthcare workers, while also similarly developing a simplified design that Ford could build at one of its Michigan plants. Under the simplified design, Ford is looking at using fans from its Ford F-150 pickup’s cooled seats to make parts of the respirators. Additionally, Ford said its U.S. design team, working with the United Auto Workers union, was starting to test transparent full-face shields for first responders, which when paired with N95 respirator masks, could be an effective way of limiting exposure to the coronavirus. The company is targeting making more than 100,000 a week at non-vehicle manufacturing facilities in Michigan, including using 3D printers to help. Ultimately, Ford officials want to create an open-sourced design that others can adopt and use to make their own shields. “The teams are just getting scrappy. How do we use what we’ve got to get to something that’s capable and would meet regulatory requirements,” Jim Baumbick, the Ford vice president in charge of the automaker’s efforts, told Reuters. On Monday, No. 1 U.S. automaker General Motors Co GM.N said it was partnering with medical equipment maker Ventec to build ventilators at GM's parts plant in Indiana. Meanwhile, Fiat Chrysler Automobile NV FCHA.MIFCAU.N told employees in an email that the Italian-American automaker would start converting one of its China plants to ultimately make over 1 million masks a month to help combat the coronavirus outbreak."

20.2020202020202," General Motors to draw down $16 billion in credit, suspends 2020 outlook (Reuters) - General Motors Co said on Tuesday it will draw about $16 billion from its credit lines in a bid to beef up liquidity amid rising business impact from the fast-spreading coronavirus outbreak. The No.1 U.S. automaker, which also suspended its 2020 outlook, said it was evaluating its quarterly dividend, but has not yet decided to suspend it. As of the end of 2019, GM had $34.6 billion in liquidity, including $17.3 billion in cash. Companies across the globe are tapping their credit lines to shore up liquidity and help them cover their costs amidst a crisis which has brought many elements of the global economy to a complete standstill. “We are aggressively pursuing austerity measures to preserve cash and are taking necessary steps in this changing and uncertain environment to manage our liquidity,” Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra said. The pandemic has already hit other automakers as well and more are expected to cut their expectations. Last week, rival Ford abandoned its 2020 forecast and said it drew down $15.4 billion from two credit facilities to bolster its balance sheet. Its more than $37 billion in cash now dwarfs its market capitalization of about $16 billion. Analysts believe that corporate liquidity is paramount and the U.S. automakers have strong enough balance sheets to weather the outbreak’s impact. Both GM and Ford have seen U.S. employees test positive for the virus, leading them to shutdown their North American plants to prevent its spread among factory workers. Meanwhile. U.S. new vehicle demand dropped 13% in the first 19 days of March, according to research firm J.D. Power, while brokerage Morgan Stanley expects auto sales to decline 9% this year, a first in many years. Shares of both Ford and GM were up 7.5% to 11% in premarket trading."

In India, it began on March 21 and will be followed by other markets, the company said, adding that it will continue for several weeks. “We are continuing to act in real time and taking added safety measures by temporarily halting production at our manufacturing sites in the international markets,” International Markets Group President Mark Ovenden said. Last week, Ford moved to hoard cash, drawing down $15.4 billion from two credit lines and suspending its dividend. It has also abandoned its 2020 financial forecast and said the cash would be used to deal with a squeeze on capital caused by shutdowns in production. The No. 2 U.S. automaker last week suspended vehicle and engine production at manufacturing sites in continental Europe. It also decided to temporarily stop production from March 23 at its London site and from the end of March 25 at its Welsh facility.

39.37360178970919," Ford hoards cash, withdraws profit forecast amid coronavirus outbreak DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co F.N on Thursday moved to hoard cash on its balance sheet, drawing down $15.4 billion from two credit lines and suspending its dividend, in a move to bolster reserves to ride out damage to its business from the coronavirus pandemic. The No. 2 U.S. automaker, whose shares closed off slightly after sinking as much as 8.9% earlier in the day, also abandoned its 2020 financial forecast and said the cash would be used to deal with a squeeze on capital caused by shutdowns in production due to the fast-spreading virus. The move will give Ford more than $37 billion in cash, almost matching the revenue it reported in the fourth quarter. That dwarfs the company’s market capitalization of about $18 billion. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said in a research note that corporate liquidity during the outbreak was “top of mind” and that U.S. automakers had strong balance sheets. The coronavirus outbreak, which started in China last year, has caused about 219,000 infections and more than 8,900 deaths globally. Comparing the current economic situation to the 2008-2009 financial crisis, Chief Executive Jim Hackett said Ford was putting in place safeguards to protect its business. “We’re at war with the virus and Ford is going to win,” Hackett told employees on a video conference. Ford has come under fire from some analysts on Wall Street for moving too slowly to cut costs and restructure its business. At the end of last year, it had booked only $3.7 billion of the projected $11 billion in charges it previously said it would take in its global restructuring. Since then, the outbreak has spread globally, leading Ford, General Motors Co GM.N and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCHA.MI, FCAU.N on Wednesday to announce the shutdown of their North American plants to prevent the spread of the disease among their factory workers. All three Detroit automakers have seen U.S. employees test positive for COVID-19, the contagious respiratory illness caused by the virus. Electric carmaker Tesla Inc TSLA.O on Thursday suspended production at its California car plant, starting March 24, to help stem the spread of the coronavirus, and added that its cash position was strong enough to navigate this period of uncertainty. The outbreak has already hit other automakers and more are expected to slash their 2020 forecasts. Evercore ISI analysts said in a research note that such actions “will be an ongoing theme in addition to the removal of (stock) buybacks.” On Wednesday, German luxury automaker BMW AG BMWG.DE cut its 2020 profit outlook, saying it would be ""significantly lower"" than last year. Two days before that, Chinese automaker Great Wall Motor Co Ltd 601633.SS also cut its 2020 sales and profit targets. GM and FCA did not change their profit forecasts on Thursday. “We are dedicated to managing our cost structure against this dynamic environment,” GM said in a statement. “We continue to monitor the situation closely and will make any necessary decisions to stay resilient.” GM had $34.6 billion in liquidity at the end of 2019, including $17.3 billion in cash. “We are evaluating the impact of all steps being taken inside the company related to the coronavirus emergency on our current financial guidance,” FCA said in a statement, adding it would provide an update when it has “sufficient visibility on market conditions.” FCA had 23.1 billion euros ($24.94 billion) in liquidity at the end of 2019. Shares of Uber Technologies Inc UBER.N closed up more than 38% on Thursday after Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi said the ride-hailing company had plenty of cash on hand. “In any crisis, liquidity is key,” he said on an investor call. Ford said on Thursday it notified lenders it would borrow the unused amounts of the two credit lines, totaling $15.4 billion. The Dearborn, Michigan-based company had $22 billion in cash at the end of last year. The dividend suspension will save Ford money at an annual rate of $2.4 billion. The company said it was prioritizing financial flexibility and investments in future technologies such as self-driving cars and a series of important 2020 vehicle launches including a redesigned version of its top-selling F-150 full-size pickup truck. Ford also withdrew its 2020 profit outlook. In February, before the coronavirus hit the United States, it offered a weaker-than-expected forecast for earnings in the range of 94 cents to $1.20 a share. Ford said it would update its outlook when it reports first-quarter results on April 28. Also on Thursday, Ford said it would offer new-car buyers up to six months of payment relief. Some U.S. dealers have begun to see sales drop off because of the virus, which has already drastically hurt demand in other countries."

39.37360178970919," GM, Ford in talks with Trump administration on medical equipment production WASHINGTON (Reuters) - General Motors Co GM.N and Ford Motor Co F.N said on Wednesday they were in talks with White House officials about how they could support production of medical equipment like ventilators that may be needed to combat the coronavirus outbreak. GM Chief Executive Mary Barra spoke to White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow about the issue after the Detroit automaker announced it will suspend North American production through March 30. Kudlow told Fox News on Wednesday that he had spoken to one automaker looking at producing ventilators. GM spokeswoman Jeannine Ginivan said the automaker “is working to help find solutions for the nation during this difficult time and has offered to help, and we are already studying how we can potentially support production of medical equipment like ventilators.” Ford said on Wednesday it “stands ready to help the administration in any way we can, including the possibility of producing ventilators and other equipment. We have had preliminary discussions with the U.S. government and are looking into the feasibility.”Kudlow praised the idea of autoworkers producing medical equipment when plans were idled. “That’s the kind of can-do spirit that we are hearing and seeing,” Kudlow said. GM and Ford could face significant hurdles before it could build a complex piece of medical equipment like a ventilator and it is unclear how long it would take to do so, however. Countries around the world have raised concerns about potential shortages of the ventilators needed to treat critically ill patients suffering from coronavirus. Running in the thousands of dollars per unit, ventilators are used to help people with respiratory difficulties to breathe. Earlier this week, Britain asked manufacturers including Ford, Honda 7267.T and Rolls Royce RR.L to help make health equipment including ventilators and said it will look at using hotels as hospitals. During World War Two, GM, Ford and other automakers retooled auto plants to build tanks, planes and other military equipment and weapons, earning Detroit the nickname the “Arsenal of Democracy.” As the coronavirus spread across China in February, a number of manufacturers in China including Apple Inc AAPL.O partner Foxconn 2317.TW and SAIC-GM-Wuling Automobile Co Ltd, a joint venture automaker formed by GM and two Chinese partners, said they had set up production lines to make masks and medical clothing."

The task force, which would be focusing on areas including vehicle production plans, is being headed by UAW President Rory Gamble, GM Chief Executive Officer Mary Barra, Ford CEO Jim Hackett, Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford and FCA CEO Michael Manley, the parties said in a joint statement on Sunday. Though automakers typically schedule plant staffing to allow for a certain proportion of absent workers, according to industry consultants, if the outbreak causes higher levels due to infection or workers staying home to care for children whose schools are closed, that could lead to reduced production or in extreme cases shutdowns. Production at an FCA assembly plant in Canada was halted for 24 hours after employees there refused to work on Thursday over fears of an employee being possibly exposed to the coronavirus. Separately on Thursday, the Italian-American automaker said that one of its employees had tested positive for COVID-19, a respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus, at its transmission plant in Indiana. The plant, however, remained open. “This is a fluid and unprecedented situation, and the task force will move quickly to build on the wide-ranging preventive measures we have put in place,” the CEOs of the three companies said in the statement.

14.74245115452931," GM, Ford to have white-collar employees work remotely starting Monday DETROIT/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. automakers General Motors Co GM.N and Ford Motor Co F.N said on Friday they will have most of their white-collar workforce working remotely as of Monday to protect against the spread of the coronavirus. Fears over the spread of the virus led hourly employees at Italian-American automaker Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV's (FCA) FCHA.MIFCAU.N minivan assembly plant in Windsor, Ontario, to stop working for a time, a spokeswoman said. The FCA workers had been concerned about possible exposure to the virus through secondary contact, but were convinced there was no risk and they returned to work Friday afternoon after about 24 hours, a spokeswoman said. GM Chief Executive Mary Barra told employees on Friday the No. 1 automaker is asking all employees and contract workers to work remotely, noting the company has faced crises before. “For many of us, it’s our first experience of this type. But disruption and trying circumstances are not new to us,” she said in an email. Barra said the remote-work policy applied globally apart from China, which has existing protocols in place. “Our IT tools and systems have been extensively stress-tested; it’s vital that we leverage them to continue delivering,” she said. Ford will shift most of its global white-collar workforce outside China, where recovery has begun, to working remotely, CEO James Hackett said in an email to employees. “In recent days ... we’ve concluded the coronavirus issue has taken on a different dimension – and we need to be proactive to keep our people safe and help limit the spread of the virus in the communities where we live and work,” he said. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV also is accelerating its deployment of remote work for white-collar employees beyond the most affected countries of China, South Korea, Japan and Italy, CEO Mike Manley said in a letter to employees seen by Reuters on Friday. Ford’s Hackett told employees that in the event a worker tests positive for the virus they will be told to get medical attention and self quarantine at home. Ford will identify others who may have been in contact with that person and instruct them to seek medical attention and self quarantine for 14 days. He added Ford will close any facility exposed to a confirmed case, and a spokeswoman confirmed that includes manufacturing plants. However, Ford has seen “limited” impact to its global operations due to the epidemic, with some employees testing positive for the virus in China and Germany but none so far in the United States, spokesman Mark Truby said. The No. 2 U.S. automaker has not lost any vehicle production outside of China and it is taking steps to keep its plants operating, he said. However, some parts of the U.S. market have seen customer traffic at dealers hurt by the outbreak, he added. On Thursday, FCA said an employee at its Indiana transmission plant had tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, but he was being treated and the plant was still operating while anyone exposed to that worker was quarantined. Manley said in the letter to employees on Thursday that FCA is focused on worker safety and keeping its plants running. “Clearly, we are now moving beyond regional hotspots and into planning for how this will impact every area of our business across the world,” he said. Changes include allowing for greater space between employees at several plants, and stepping up cleaning and availability of face masks, Manley said. FCA said this week it was temporarily halting operations at some Italian plants and would reduce production rates in response to the outbreak."

Barra said the remote-work policy applied globally apart from China, which has existing protocols in place. “Our IT tools and systems have been extensively stress-tested; it’s vital that we leverage them to continue delivering,” she said. Ford will shift most of its global white-collar workforce outside China, where recovery has begun, to working remotely, CEO James Hackett said in an email to employees. “In recent days ... we’ve concluded the coronavirus issue has taken on a different dimension – and we need to be proactive to keep our people safe and help limit the spread of the virus in the communities where we live and work,” he said. Italian-American automaker Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV (FCA) also is accelerating its deployment of remote work for white-collar employees beyond the most affected countries of China, South Korea, Japan and Italy, CEO Mike Manley said in a letter to employees seen by Reuters on Friday. Ford’s Hackett told employees that in the event a worker tests positive for the virus they will be told to get medical attention and self quarantine at home. Ford will identify others who may have been in contact with that person and instruct them to seek medical attention and self quarantine for 14 days. He added Ford will close any facility exposed to a confirmed case, and a spokeswoman confirmed that includes manufacturing plants. However, Ford has seen “limited” impact to its global operations due to the epidemic, with some employees testing positive for the virus in China and Germany but none so far in the United States, spokesman Mark Truby said. The No. 2 U.S. automaker has not lost any vehicle production outside of China and it is taking steps to keep its plants operating, he said. However, some parts of the U.S. market have seen customer traffic at dealers hurt by the outbreak, he added. On Thursday, FCA said an employee at its Indiana transmission plant had tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, but he was being treated and the plant was still operating while anyone exposed to that worker was quarantined. Manley said in the letter to employees on Thursday that FCA is focused on worker safety and keeping its plants running. “Clearly, we are now moving beyond regional hotspots and into planning for how this will impact every area of our business across the world,” he said. Changes include allowing for greater space between employees at several plants, and stepping up cleaning and availability of face masks, Manley said. FCA said this week it was temporarily halting operations at some Italian plants and would reduce production rates in response to the outbreak.

14.74245115452931," Ford takes aim at Jeep with new Bronco SUVs DETROIT (Reuters) - Nearly 55 years after the debut of the original Ford Bronco — and 24 years after the demise of the last one — Ford Motor Co. F.N is dusting off one of its treasured nameplates this spring in hopes of reviving a decades-old rivalry with Fiat Chrysler Automobile’s FCHA.MI popular Jeep brand. Leading the charge is a trim new mid-size Bronco sport utility vehicle, based on the Ranger pickup. Ford insiders have hinted there are more Bronco models to follow, including a smaller, car-based Bronco Sport later this year, with rumors of a Bronco pickup and a high-performance Bronco Raptor said to be under consideration. The automaker is slated to reveal details of the 2021 Bronco on March 17. Since announcing the return of the Bronco three years ago, Ford executives have made it clear the latest edition is targeted at the long-lived Jeep Wrangler. The rivalry dates back to mid-1965, when the original Bronco was launched as a compact two-door SUV, aimed squarely at the Jeep CJ, the predecessor of the Wrangler. But Ford does not intend to stop there. It sees the potential to build a franchise around the Bronco name, a feat accomplished by Jeep over a period of eight decades, though under at least six owners. Beau Boeckmann, president of Galpin Ford in the Los Angeles area and one of the largest U.S. Ford dealers, said the return of the Bronco is the most exciting vehicle launch he has seen from Ford in a long time. “I’ve had more people ask about this car than anything else we’ve launched,” he said. “I don’t see why Bronco’s potential wouldn’t be the same as Jeep’s.” The Jeep family now includes six nameplates in North America, from the tiny Renegade to the new Gladiator pickup, with several additional models sold overseas and more coming. The Jeep brand generates a huge share of Fiat Chrysler’s profit, analysts say. So much so that Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas three years ago estimated the Jeep brand alone was worth 120% of the parent company’s market value — more than $20 billion at the time. Last year, Fiat Chrysler sold 1.5 million Jeeps globally, down from 1.6 million in 2018. That seems like a distant target for the resurrected Bronco, for which Ford has relatively modest aspirations: About 125,000 sales in its first year, suppliers say. Sales of the earlier Bronco peaked in 1979 at around 100,000. Ford hinted at the general shape and size of the new Bronco last fall when it revealed a racing version called Bronco R. The new model goes into production this spring at Ford’s Wayne, Michigan, plant. The 2021 Bronco Sport, which shares underpinnings with the Ford Escape, is slated for production this fall at Ford’s Hermosillo plant in Mexico."

-11.190817790530838," Ford bets more businesses want carbon-free delivery vans DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co is putting more chips on a bet that it can profit from selling electric vans to delivery businesses that need to reduce carbon emissions. Ford will roll out an all-electric version of its Transit van for North America in model year 2022, mirroring the timetable for launching a similar model for the European market, the company said on Tuesday in conjunction with the NTEA Work Truck Show in Indianapolis. “Our electric bet as a company is different than our competitors,” Ford Chief Operating Officer Jim Farley said in an interview. “The most critical bet we will be making over the next several years will be our commercial vehicles.” Two of three electric vehicles Ford has announced as part of an $11.5 billion investment in electrification through 2022 are aimed at commercial customers - the Transit and an electric version of the company’s best-selling model, the F-150 pickup. Ford’s Mustang Mach-E electric SUV represents a low-volume challenge to electric luxury vehicle market leader Tesla Inc. The electric Transit and F-150 will play in market segments Ford dominates in the United States and Europe. “Half of the vehicles doing work in the U.S. are Ford Motor Co vehicles,” Farley said. Ford is also the No. 1 commercial vehicle brand in Europe, and has led the commercial van market in Britain, which is Europe’s largest, for 55 years. Regulators in Europe and in some U.S. cities are stepping up pressure on businesses to replace diesel or gasoline-fueled delivery vans with electric models to reduce pollution in city centers. In the United States, Amazon.com Inc, has ordered 100,000 electric delivery vans from start-up Rivian, the first of which will be delivered in 2021 and built in Normal, Illinois. Ford has a separate partnership with Rivian. The electric Transit will not be related to the Rivian van, said Ted Cannis, Ford’s director of electrification. The new Transit will be an early test of the company’s efforts to deploy new connectivity technology and services to go with it, Farley said. Ford said the electric Transit will be built in America and cost more than the gasoline-powered version, which starts at $34,500. Research firm Auto Forecast Solutions said it will be built in Kansas City, Missouri, along with the gasoline version. Supplier sources who asked not to be identified said Ford will launch production in late 2021, with plans to build around 2,000 that year and increase to 14,000 annually by 2023."

Other key plans include speeding up Ford’s push in vehicle connectivity and its commercial vehicle business, strategy chief Jim Farley, who begins his role as Ford COO on March 1 after being appointed earlier this month, said at a Wolfe Research conference in New York. “We have to fix a number of things,” he told investors, citing a need to cut $5 billion in warranty costs, successfully launch 10 key global vehicles in the next two years, and slash material and logistics costs. Ford has acknowledged that mistakes proved costly in its introduction of the redesigned Explorer SUV. Electric carmaker Tesla Inc TSLA.O has shown how connected vehicles and over-the-air updates can build customer loyalty, Farley said, and Ford could better profit from the data generated in vehicles and improve its customer service. Ford also will focus more heavily on advantages in commercial vehicle sales. “This is the signature execution opportunity for Ford and growth opportunity for Ford,” Farley said.

-39.95067817509248," Ford shakes up top management, promises faster turnaround DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co F.N on Friday shook up its top management, naming strategy chief Jim Farley as chief operating officer of the No. 2 U.S. automaker and promising skeptical investors the company will kick a slow-moving turnaround into a higher gear. Ford’s move positions Farley, 57, as potential heir to Chief Executive Jim Hackett, who took over in May 2017. Farley is currently president of new businesses, technology and strategy but will now be responsible for all global operations as well as future technology such as self-driving cars. News of Farley’s promotion and the retirement of automotive president Joe Hinrichs, another potential CEO candidate, effective on March 1, came three days after Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford saw its shares slide following a disappointing forecast. On Friday, Ford shares were off as much as 2.8% to their lowest price since January 2019 and finished the day down about 1.7 percent. Farley told Reuters that Ford needs to move more quickly, especially around taking advantage of the software, data and connectivity in its vehicles including commercial vehicles. Farley added that Ford was “deep” in partnership talks with digital companies to improve its customer experience. “We put a lot of new cost and capability in these new vehicles,” Farley said in a telephone interview. “We have to get a lot quicker in taking advantage of them. We do not have two or three years to figure out how we use connectivity in the F-150 and our new electric architecture that we launch later this year.” Ford is in the midst of a global restructuring and faces slumping demand in China, its second-largest market. Hackett said on a conference call with reporters that the company needs to move with greater speed, echoing what some investors have said. “It’s my judgment the time is to move with urgency now to fully integrate and accelerate Ford’s transformation,” Hackett said. “We’re now in execution mode and what the company needs is to come together,” Hackett added, saying he had no plans to leave the company after almost three years on the job and it was the board’s role to manage succession. Analysts and investors have speculated how long Hackett, 64, will remain as CEO and whether an internal executive or an outsider will succeed him. Ford’s struggles, including a poor launch of its new Ford Explorer SUV and rising warranty costs, have only heightened speculation. Ford restructuring is far from complete. It said on Tuesday it has booked $3.7 billion of the projected $11 billion in charges it previously said it would take, and expects to book another $900 million to $1.4 billion this year. In China, Ford lost $771 million last year, about half the 2018 loss, and its market share there has shrunk. Ford has been struggling to revive sales there since its business began slumping in late 2017, and now the world’s largest market has been hit by a fast-spreading coronavirus that has killed more than 630 people. Another key element for 2020 is Ford’s planned introduction of a fully redesigned F-150 full-sized pickup truck, its top profit generator, as well as the Mustang Mach-E electric SUV and the Ford Bronco utility vehicle. Farley joined Ford in 2007 as global head of marketing and sales and went on to lead Lincoln, South America, Ford of Europe and all of Ford's global markets in successive roles. He previously worked at Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T. Farley is credited, along with Hackett, in forcing the redesign before its introduction of the Mach-E and the decision to make it a Mustang vehicle, leveraging that iconic brand. Farley has owned seven of the cars starting with a 1965 model he restored when he was 14 years old."
-40.192539109506626," Ford shares fall 8% after disappointing 2020 profit outlook (Reuters) - Shares of Ford Motor Co F.N fell nearly 8% on Wednesday, a day after the automaker forecast a lower profit for 2020, surprising analysts who also criticized the company's management for holding back details on the earnings shortfall. The disappointing outlook underscores the higher costs that Ford has been spending on developing self-driving and electric cars to keep pace with pioneers like Tesla Inc TSLA.O. The No. 2 U.S. automaker by sales volume is far behind Tesla in the development of electric car technology. A recent rally in Tesla’s shares have taken its market capitalization to $160 billion, nearly four times that of Ford’s valuation, despite having sales volumes that are less than 10% of Ford. Shares of the company were down 7.6% at $8.47 in premarket trading. Ford forecast 2020 adjusted earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) between $5.6 billion and $6.6 billion, largely below at the midpoint, compared with $6.4 billion in 2019. “It’s not clear to us exactly what is driving the profit lower...The lack of transparency is not likely to sit well with investors or inspire confidence,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Joseph Spak said, lowering target price on the stock to $9 from $10. Ford also warned of lower profits at its credit arm and higher warranty costs, but did not provide details. “Management declined to quantify the impact of the higher warranty, making it difficult to gauge at the moment how much or when costs should normalize lower,” said J.P. Morgan analyst Ryan Brinkman, cutting price target by a $1 to $9. “The 2020 guidance makes it hard for us to see why investors should get excited about owning Ford stock now,” Morningstar analyst David Whiston wrote in a note. While 2021 looks promising for Ford due to its 2020 new product investment, “investors are likely to sit out” until the company is able to show “sustainable” improvement in its profit, Spak said. Ford's adjusted EBIT has fallen for at least two consecutive years. The company's stock rose about 5% in the past 12 months, underperforming a 21% increase in the S&P 500 index .SPX. Ford's larger rival General Motors Co GM.N on Wednesday forecast flat profits for 2020, as it kicked off a new effort to win over investors stampeding into shares of Tesla."
-40.192539109506626," Ford shares dive after carmaker posts fourth-quarter loss, disappointing 2020 outlook DEARBORN, Mich. (Reuters) - Investors sent Ford Motor Co shares skidding on Tuesday after the company delivered a weaker-than-expected 2020 forecast, warning of higher warranty costs, lower profits at its credit arm and continued investments in future technology such as self-driving cars. Shares in the No. 2 U.S. automaker plunged 9.4% in after-hours trading, shaving more than $3 billion off the company’s value. In comparison, electric carmaker Tesla closed up nearly 14%, pushing its market cap to $160 billion, more than four times the size of Ford’s $36.4 billion. “The results were not OK in 2019,” Ford Chief Financial Officer Tim Stone told reporters at the company’s headquarters outside Detroit. “As I look to 2020 and beyond, I’m very optimistic,” he said, while cautioning that Ford’s lower guidance does not yet account for the potential impact of the coronavirus outbreak in China. In an after-hours call with financial analysts, Chief Executive Jim Hackett was more blunt about the challenge of balancing Ford’s protracted turnaround efforts with its continuing work on future technology, including electric and self-driving cars. “I don’t think this company can keep straddling the old and new worlds forever ... This company has to change,” Hackett said. Ford said it expects 2020 operating earnings to be in the range of 94 cents to $1.20 a share. Analysts were expecting $1.26 a share. Stone said Ford expects to continue its quarterly dividend of 15 cents, which could cost the company $2.4 billion in 2020. Asked about continuing the dividend after lowering its 2020 guidance, Hackett said, “We like to return value to shareholders.” The disappointing 2020 forecast, coming after Ford previously trimmed its 2019 outlook, is a blow for Hackett, who took the helm in May 2017. He has been asking investors to be patient with a restructuring that has seen the formation of a wide-ranging alliance on commercial, electric and autonomous vehicles with Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE and the sale of its money-losing operations in India to a venture controlled by India's Mahindra & Mahindra. But by Ford’s own accounting, the restructuring is far from complete. It has booked $3.7 billion of the projected $11 billion in charges it previously said it would take, and expects to book another $900 million to $1.4 billion this year. For the fourth quarter of 2019, Ford reported a net loss of $1.7 billion, or 42 cents a share, compared with a loss of $100 million, or 3 cents a share, a year earlier. The quarter included a loss of $2.2 billion due to higher contributions to its employee pension plans, something it disclosed last month. Revenue in the quarter fell 5% to $39.7 billion, above the $36.5 billion Wall Street had expected. Ford’s adjusted free cash flow fell 67% in the fourth quarter to $500 million, including the $600 million cost of bonuses related to a new labor deal with the United Auto Workers union. The UAW deal also played a role in driving North American automotive profit margins down to 2.8% in the fourth quarter. Ford said its operating losses in China last year totaled $771 million, including a loss of $207 million in the fourth quarter. It lost $1.5 billion in 2018. Ford’s market share in China in the fourth quarter fell to 2% from 2.3% last year. In December, Ford said it would halve its operating loss in 2019 and nearly halve it again in 2020, followed by further improvement in 2021. However, that forecast was before the appearance of the fast-spreading coronavirus and its crippling effects on China’s economy. Ford’s China sales fell about 15% in the fourth quarter and 26% for the year as it continued to lose ground in its second-biggest market. Ford has been struggling to revive sales in China since its business began slumping in late 2017. Detroit rivals General Motors Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles are scheduled to report their results on Wednesday and Thursday, respectively."

The No. 2 U.S. automaker, struggling to complete a long-running restructuring and faced with continued losses in China, said it expects 2020 operating earnings in the range of 94 cents to $1.20 a share, below the $1.26 analysts were expecting, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

The U.S. automaker said bit.ly/30PrDky it will record a $2 billion loss related to pension plans outside the United States and a $600 million loss associated with other post-retirement employee benefits plans globally. However, the overall loss was offset by a $400 million gain associated with pension plans in the United States. On an after-tax basis, the loss is expected to reduce Ford’s net income by about $1.7 billion in the fourth quarter. The loss will not impact the adjusted earnings per share as it is a special item, the company said."
-47.327662904109744," Stakes are high for businesses, products liability plaintiffs in Supreme Court’s new Ford cases (Reuters) - On Friday, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear two cases in which Ford is challenging rulings by state supreme courts that allowed state residents involved in in-state car accidents to proceed with product liability suits against Ford. The company and its amici from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Manufacturers and other business groups are hoping that the Supreme Court uses the cases to establish that plaintiffs in personal injury suits cannot establish specific personal jurisdiction unless they can show that defendants’ actions within the jurisdiction led directly to the claims in the case. How big a deal would such a ruling be? Very big indeed, said trial lawyer Kyle Farrar of Kaster Lynch Farrar & Ball, who represents the plaintiff in one of the Ford cases the Supreme Court will hear. “These cases could fundamentally change products liability law in this country forever,” Farrar said. Want more On the Case? Listen to the On the Case podcast. It’s easier to understand Ford’s arguments when you know the particulars. Back in 2014, the Supreme Court ruled in Daimler AG v. Baumann that defendants’ due process rights restricted the general jurisdiction of U.S. courts against foreign corporations. The justices concluded that plaintiffs could not establish California's general jurisdiction over Daimler simply because the corporation conducted business in the state. The Daimler court expressly distinguished between general and specific jurisdiction, but Ford’s lawyers at Hogan Lovells came up with the theory that they could use Daimler to cast doubt on the premise that plaintiffs can establish specific jurisdiction by merely pointing to a defendant’s business activities. Ford’s argument crystallized around suits involving used cars and trucks that were purchased in the secondary market. In the Supreme Court’s 1980 ruling in World-Wide Volkswagen Corp v. Woodson the court held that defendants are subject to a court’s personal jurisdiction if they have placed an allegedly defective product into the “stream of commerce” with the expectation that the product will be purchased by consumers in that forum. The court toughened the standard a bit in 1987’s Asahi Metal v. Superior Court of California, demanding some additional showing that defendants intended to serve the forum’s market. But Ford’s lawyers, led by Hogan’s Sean Marotta, argued that plaintiffs had to do still more under Daimler and the Supreme Court’s 2017 decision restricting personal jurisdiction in Bristol-Myers Squibb v. Superior Court of California: To comply with defendants’ due process rights, plaintiffs had to show that their allegations arose directly from Ford’s conduct. Yes, Ford said, the company markets its cars and has dealerships across the country. But if Ford didn’t sell plaintiffs the cars or trucks at the heart of their claims, the company argued, then its conduct cannot not give rise to plaintiffs’ claims. Ford can only be tagged with liability for designing, manufacturing and selling allegedly defective vehicles, the company contended. Plaintiffs can’t rely on vague “stream of commerce” arguments, according to the company, to establish specific jurisdiction if they didn’t buy their cars from Ford. State supreme courts in both Minnesota, in Bandemer v. Ford, and Montana, in Ford v. Montana 8th Judicial District Court, rejected Ford’s theory in 2019 decisions. The courts both found that Ford subjected itself to their jurisdiction by marketing to customers in their states, selling and repairing cars and trucks through dealerships in their states and otherwise providing services, such as driver assistance and recall notifications, to state residents who own Ford vehicles. In Ford’s petitions for certiorari in the Minnesota and Montana cases, Hogan Lovells emphasized a split in both state and federal courts over whether – and to what extent – a plaintiff must show, in order to establish specific jurisdiction, that the conduct of an out-of-state defendant caused the plaintiff’s alleged injuries. Some states, including Montana and Minnesota in their 2019 Ford rulings, have said plaintiffs need not show a causal link. But other state and federal courts have required plaintiffs to show a direct link between a defendant’s conduct and a plaintiff’s alleged injuries – some imposing a “but-for” standard, some insisting on a more stringent proximate cause standard and still others not specifying what causation test they would apply. “These different approaches give plaintiffs every reason to bring suit in the courthouse they believe will be more receptive to their claims,” Ford argued. “That is particularly easy to do in products-liability suits like this one; a plaintiff’s attorney will usually have no trouble finding an in-forum defendant who has had some contact with the product and whose joinder will destroy complete diversity.” The Chamber’s amicus brief, written by Mayer Brown, echoed that theme, arguing that plaintiffs have learned to plead specific jurisdiction to engage in “rampant” forum-shopping at the expense of defendants’ due process rights. The no-causation approach of the Minnesota and Montana courts in the Ford cases, the brief said, “means that companies that do business in a large number of states would have no ability to predict where, and to what extent, they might be haled into court. States would be newly empowered to regulate conduct that occurred entirely outside their borders — contrary to the principles of federalism that animate this court’s personal jurisdiction precedents.” In opposition, Minnesota plaintiff Adam Bandemer, represented by Farrar of Kaster Lynch, and Montana plaintiff Charles Lucero, represented by Deepak Gupta of Gupta Wessler, argued that the state supreme courts had faithfully applied U.S. Supreme Court precedent. The opposition briefs pointed out that no state supreme court or federal appellate court has adopted Ford’s view that plaintiffs can’t establish specific jurisdiction without showing that their cars were designed, manufactured or originally sold in their chosen forum. “Ford does not even attempt to ground its strict causation standard in the original meaning of the Due Process Clause or in any historical tradition,” the Bandemer opposition brief said. “And its rule likewise finds no justification in fairness or federalism, the two principles that have animated the Court’s modern personal jurisdiction doctrine.” If the Supreme Court adopts Ford’s standard, Farrar said, it will create high hurdles for products liability plaintiffs attempting to sue makers of component parts, who would be able to argue against specific jurisdiction because their parts were first sold to manufacturers, not to consumers. Farrar, who said that he’s brought Gupta into his case for briefing on the merits, also predicted that if the justice agree with Ford, defendants will try to structure sales to restrict jurisdiction to favorable forums. But Farrar said he’s confident the Supreme Court will side with plaintiffs. “We’re going to put an end to this question,” he said."

Ford is challenging last summer’s rulings by the high courts of Montana and Minnesota, which allowed product liability suits to go forward even though the automaker had not designed, built or sold either of the allegedly defective cars there, or otherwise done anything within the state’s borders to cause the problems alleged by the plaintiffs.

Ford Vietnam, established in 1995, said the expanded factory would boost the U.S. automaker’s annual capacity in Vietnam to 40,000 vehicles from current volume of 14,000 units per year. The company reported it sold 32,175 cars in 2019, up 31% from a year earlier. The additional investment, which will bring the company’s total investments in Vietnam to more than $200 million, will come in two stages over a two-year period starting this year. Deputy Trade Minister Do Than Hai said he expected the expansion would reduce Vietnam’s reliance on imported vehicles and therefore lower the country’s trade deficit. The construction will expand the facility across an additional 60,000 square meters of land, bringing the total area to 226,000 square meters.

-43.206113927875066," Ford's China vehicle sales drop 26% in third straight year of decline SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co's F.N China vehicle sales fell for a third consecutive year, by 26.1%, as it battles a prolonged overall sales decline in its second-biggest market that has hit demand for its mass-market Ford brand and sports utility vehicles. The U.S. automaker delivered 146,473 vehicles in China in the fourth quarter, down 14.7% year-on-year, Ford said in a statement. In total, it sold 567,854 vehicles over 2019. Ford has been trying to revive sales in China after its business began slumping in late 2017. Sales sank 37% in 2018, after a 6% decline in 2017. Anning Chen, president and chief executive of Ford Greater China, said that while 2019 was a “challenging” year for the automaker, it saw its market share in the high-to-premium segment stabilize and its sales decline in the value segment start to narrow in the second-half of the year. “The pressure from the external environment and downward trend of the industry volume will continue in 2020, and we will put more efforts into strengthening our product lineup with more customer-centric products and customer experiences to mitigate the external pressure and improve dealers’ profitability.” The automaker plans to launch more than 30 new models in China over the next three years of which over a third will be electric vehicles. It has also said it would localize management teams by hiring more Chinese staff and aimed to improve relationships with joint venture partners. Models launched in the fourth quarter include a new Ford Escape version - for which the automaker said orders received so far have been much higher than expected - and the Lincoln Corsair, the first localized Lincoln model in China. Bill Russo, head of Shanghai consultancy Automobility Ltd, said Ford was dealing with a “perfect storm” of trends which were not favorable to multinational mass market brands, and while the automaker was addressing the need to update its showrooms with new and refreshed models, this was taking time. “They managed to stop the bleeding and increase average selling price,” he said of their 2019 sales figures. “Good sign, but they need to do more to localize their business model to address the growth in non-hardware related mobility and digital services if they are to recapture growth.” In China, Ford makes cars through a joint venture with Chongqing Changan Automobile Co Ltd 000625.SZ and Jiangling Motors Corp Ltd (JMC) 000550.SZ. It has also said it would partner Zotye Automobile Co Ltd 000980.SZ to sell lower priced cars. Its larger U.S. rival General Motors Co GM.N last week said its sales in China fell 15% from a year earlier to 3.09 million vehicles in 2019, its second year of decline. China’s auto market is set to contract by 2% in 2020 for the third year of decline, the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM) forecast, due to a weaker economy and trade dispute with the United States. Over 28 million vehicles were sold in 2018, down 3% from the prior year, while 2019 sales are likely to have declined 8% from the prior year, CAAM said."

-49.70479601963978," Ford quarterly sales slip on slowdown in passenger cars demand (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co on Monday posted a 1.3% fall in fourth-quarter vehicle sales as soft demand for passenger cars outweighed higher sales of pick-up trucks. Ford’s figures rounded off U.S. automakers’ sales for 2019, with passenger cars falling out of favor with buyers amid lower oil prices and as automakers focused on SUVs and pick-ups that are more profitable. Total U.S. light-vehicle sales fell by about 1% from 2018, but still finished above 17 million vehicles for the fifth consecutive year. Discounts during the key holiday season and lower interest rates helped pushed sales of Ford’s trucks to 330,075 in the quarter, up from 284,859 trucks a year earlier. However, passenger car sales at the company declined 41% to 63,400 cars. The No. 2 U.S. automaker said it sold 601,862 vehicles in the quarter, compared with 609,693 vehicles a year earlier. Shares of the company fell as much as 1.6%, while shares of No.1 U.S. automaker General Motors Co declined 1.4%.

The Republican-controlled Senate confirmed Brouillette 70-15. Brouillette will replace Rick Perry, who stepped down on Sunday while at the center of Trump’s impeachment probe in the U.S. House of Representatives for his role as one of the “three amigos” who ran a side foreign policy in Ukraine, under Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. Perry has said he did nothing wrong and his role in Ukraine centered on natural gas and coal. Brouillette, 57, faced questions at his confirmation hearing last month from Democratic Senator Ron Wyden about his own involvement with Ukraine. He said his role was focused on how U.S. energy supplies could help the country find alternatives to fuel from Russia. Wyden, who voted against Brouillette, asked what the rush was to confirm him, while questions linger about the role of Trump officials in Ukraine. Senator Joe Manchin, a Democrat from coal-producing West Virginia, said ahead of the vote that Brouillette was “really the right person (at the) right time for this job.” Brouillette, a member of Louisiana’s Mineral and Energy Board from 2013 to 2016, is expected to firmly support Trump’s policy of maximizing production of oil, natural gas and coal, offering them for sale abroad, and rolling back regulations. Before being a Louisiana state energy regulator, Brouillette was an assistant secretary for congressional and intergovernmental affairs at the Energy Department under former President George W. Bush. Brouillette said last month he backs technologies to capture carbon dioxide from fossil fuels and burying the gas linked to climate change underground, because oil, gas and coal would provide a large portion of energy needs for 40 to 50 years. “We have to get these technologies off the shelf and into the market,” Brouillette said at his confirmation hearing. He also supports nuclear power plants, but it is not clear how the Department of Energy can help reactors that are at risk of closing due to stiff competition from a glut of cheap natural gas and from falling costs for wind and solar power."

-18.616879762140044," Lincoln electric SUV to use Ford-backed startup's 'skateboard' chassis: sources DETROIT (Reuters) - A battery-powered Lincoln SUV, due in mid-2022, will be the first Ford Motor Co F.N vehicle built on a custom electrified chassis that resembles a skateboard, which was developed by Ford-backed startup Rivian, according to several people familiar with the program. The all-wheel-drive Lincoln SUV could compete against Rivian’s R1S, an electric sport utility vehicle slated to go into production in early 2021 that will be priced from $72,500. Both models will use Rivian’s so-called skateboard, a flexible platform that combines electric motors, batteries, controls and suspension. On Tuesday, Ford declined to comment. Rivian did not respond to a request for comment. The new Lincoln, which carries the internal program code U787, also could compete with premium offerings from others, including General Motors Co GM.N, which plans to introduce at least two new electric SUVs by 2023, one for Cadillac and one that could revive the Hummer name, sources have said. Ford invested $500 million in Rivian this year and plans to help it begin production next year at a former Mitsubishi plant in Normal, Illinois. When Ford made the investment, it said it would use Rivian’s skateboard to develop its own electric vehicle, but did not disclose details. It is not clear where Ford intends to build the Lincoln SUV, which will be among the first of several battery-powered utility vehicles planned for Ford’s premium brand in North America and China, according to supplier sources familiar with those programs who asked not to be identified. Ford expects to introduce a compact Lincoln electric crossover in late 2021 or early 2022 and a mid-size companion in 2023, the sources said. The U.S. auto industry plans to invest billions of dollars over the next few years to build all-electric pickups and SUVs, sectors of the market that have been among the most profitable, especially for Detroit-based automakers. But analysts have questioned whether demand from consumers and commercial customers will come close to matching production. Founded in 2009, Rivian has raised $1.9 billion from investors, including e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O, which has ordered 100,000 electric delivery vehicles from Rivian. The first Amazon vans will be built in Normal and are to be delivered in 2021. Ford aims to sell an electric F-series pickup in late 2021, sources have said. It also will offer the electric Mustang Mach E SUV next year as part of plans to invest $11.5 billion by 2022 electrifying its vehicles."

By accelerating the “clock speed” of vehicle development, cutting overlapping product architectures to just five from 13 and extending the company’s most successful brands to new products, Ford could slash $20 billion out of a five-year, 2018-2023 product plan, Hackett told Reuters. “This is the first thing we generated out of this new thinking,” Hackett said in an interview ahead of the Mach E unveiling. “We have a lot more coming.” For Ford Chairman Bill Ford Jr., the Mustang Mach E puts together two previously conflicting goals: His desire for Ford to be a leader in clean cars and make the automaker carbon-neutral by 2030, and his personal love of the Mustang and its growling V-8 engine. “We are really pushing our chips in on the table with this vehicle,” Ford said in an interview ahead of the Mach E’s unveiling. The automaker has said it will spend $11.5 billion developing electric and hybrid models by 2022. Automakers have struggled to make money on electric vehicles. Bill Ford told Reuters on Sunday after unveiling the Mach E “will be profitable right from the start.” Ford’s confidence in the Mach E, and its determination to challenge Tesla, was reflected in the location the company chose to reveal it: An airplane hangar just a short walk from the main offices of Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s SpaceX operations in Hawthorne, Calif. Musk often uses SpaceX facilities to unveil Tesla’s new models, and has scheduled the debut of his electric pickup truck for somewhere in Los Angeles on Thursday. Musk replied to Ford’s event with a tweet late Sunday: “Congratulations on the Mach E! Sustainable/electric cars are the future!! Excited to see this announcement from Ford, as it will encourage other carmakers to go electric too.” The Mach E started with humble ambitions. The SUV originally was to be what Ted Cannis, Ford’s global director for electrification, called a “compliance” play - an electric variant of a front-wheel drive internal combustion vehicle, aimed at generating emissions credits to comply with clean air regulations at low cost. There was no link to Mustang’s muscle car image. Boring electric cars were the norm for Ford and other legacy automakers. Then Tesla Inc TSLA.O in 2013 launched its Model S - an electric car that looked like a sporty European luxury sedan with a giant screen for a dashboard and entertainment and functional features that could be upgraded with over-the-air software updates. Tesla’s market value is now higher than Ford’s. Ford’s own customer research showed dull electric cars were a mistake, Cannis and other executives said. ‘MUSTANG EXPERIENCE’ Those doubts came to a head in mid-2017 when Hackett, then newly appointed, reviewed the design for the electric SUV with Executive Vice President Jim Farley, who has owned seven of the cars starting with a 1965 model he restored when he was 14 years old. “It’s not good enough,” Hackett recalled saying. Farley agreed, and Hackett said, “We tear it up.” The team designing the vehicle started over, using a new architecture engineered from the start to be a battery electric vehicle, instead of the original plan to use a modified version of an internal combustion engine vehicle, Ford executives said. The Mustang muscle car’s distinctive “shark face” front end and body proportions were adapted to a new skin, and under the floor Ford designed a new battery pack that can deliver up to 300 miles (483 km) of range in an “extended range” version. The re-do had to be accomplished much faster than normal to stay on target for a fall 2020 launch. “We were super behind time,” said exterior designer Chris Walter during a briefing on the vehicle ahead of the Los Angeles debut. A concept for new dashboard software and a display using a 15.5-inch (39 cm) diagonal screen was pulled together in just 90 days by a 15-person group that called itself Team Menlo - a reference to Thomas Edison’s Menlo Park, New Jersey, laboratory. A paper prototype of the new screen used an empty Keurig coffee pod to represent a large control knob. The overhaul cost money, but Ford product development chief Hau Thai-tang told Reuters the dedicated electric vehicle architecture should allow for 25% to 30% improvements in manufacturing efficiency to help offset the cost. The final call on using the Mustang name came from the top, and was not given easily. “I was dead set against it, initially,” Bill Ford said. Ford said he started to warm to the idea as he saw the styling and the performance data for the vehicle. Ford said he did not grant his approval until earlier this year after driving a prototype. “It felt like a Mustang experience to me,” he said. This is not the first time a challenge to reinvent the Mustang has emboldened Ford employees to break with convention during a rough patch in the company’s history. The original Mustang launched in 1964 was derived from a mainstream Falcon compact car, and quickly became a hit, far out-selling the company’s projections. In the early 1990s, with the economy in a slump, a small group of Ford employees rebelled against a plan to transform the rear-wheel drive Mustang into a front-wheel drive car developed by Ford's then-partner, Japanese automaker Mazda Motor Corp 7261.T. That project became a laboratory for cutting the costs of product engineering by putting representatives of different functions on the same team. The Mach E is another turning point, Hackett said. “The science project platform for EVs is now gone.”"

-8.41257747574382," Factbox: Ford bets Mustang muscle can sell an electric SUV (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co F.N has tried and failed to generate interest in utilitarian electric vehicles such as a battery-powered Focus compact car. Now, the company is using the high-performance image of its Mustang muscle cars to sell an electric SUV. Here are some details of the Mustang Mach E's design and performance. What’s in the name? The Mustang Mach E name is a reference to the high-performance “Mach 1” versions of the Mustang sports car that Ford has offered at various times. How much will it cost? Ford says the Mach E will start at about $43,000. There will be three versions to start with: Select, Premium and First Edition. In 2021, Ford plans a “California Route 1” model and in the spring of 2021 a high-performance GT model. How long will it run on a charge? Ford is aiming for 230 miles (370 km) of driving range per charge for standard models, and 300 miles for “extended range” models. The rival Tesla Model Y sport utility has a 300-mile range for rear-drive models, and 280 miles of range for all-wheel drive and performance models. How fast is it? Tesla Inc TSLA.O Chief Executive Elon Musk pioneered high-performance electric vehicles. Ford plans to join Porsche and other automakers in catching up. Ford is aiming to make the standard Mach E's time from 0 to 60 miles per hour faster than the least expensive Porsche Macan sport utility. The Mach E GT's acceleration target is in the ""mid-3-second"" range - on a par with a high-performance Porsche 911, Ford said. How big is the dashboard screen? Ford will offer a 15.5 inch screen in the Mach E. The Tesla Model 3 offers a 15-inch (38 cm)screen. Ford has developed a new generation of its Sync infotainment software that can be updated over the air, like a Tesla. When will the Mach E go on sale? Ford will start taking reservations for Mach Es on Sunday, Nov. 17, asking customers to put down a $500 deposit. Vehicles are scheduled to start shipping to customers in late 2020. Where’s the growl? Mustang coupes deliver a distinctive engine growl that is as much a part of the brand as the pony logo. The Mach E will have no pistons or exhaust pipes. Ford said it will make noises in three modes: Whisper, Engage and Unbridled. How much can it haul? The Mach E will have 59.6 cubic feet of load space with the rear seats folded down. The vehicle will also have a front trunk, or “frunk,” that can carry 4.8 cubic feet of stuff - and has a drain in the bottom that makes it usable as a drink cooler."

-8.41257747574382," Ford's UAW members vote to ratify new four-year contract DETROIT (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers union said on Friday that rank-and-file members at Ford Motor Co have voted in favor of a new four-year labor contract with the No. 2 U.S. automaker. The UAW will now focus on Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA), the sole remaining Detroit automaker without a new labor contract. Talks with FCA are expected to begin on Monday, a UAW spokesman said. The union said 56.3% of Ford’s hourly workers voted to approve the deal, which allowed the company to avoid a strike like the one that cost its larger rival General Motors Co about $3 billion (£2.3 billion). UAW leaders said earlier this month that Ford under the deal agreed to invest more than $6 billion in its U.S. plants, and to create or retain more than 8,500 UAW jobs. The deal also includes pay raises and lump-sum payments over the life of the contract, a pathway to full-time employment for temporary employees and unchanged healthcare coverage. Workers at GM approved a deal in late October that ended a contentious 40-day U.S. strike, the longest automotive labor stoppage since 1970. Detailed terms of the Ford deal - released just a week after GM workers approved their new contract - echoed those agreed to with GM, as the union typically uses the first deal as a template for those that follow. UAW leaders managed contract negotiations with Ford and GM, including the lengthy strike, while struggling with an ongoing federal corruption probe. To date, 10 people have pleaded guilty in connection with the criminal investigation into illegal payoffs. Just last week former UAW vice president and former GM board member Joseph Ashton was charged with conspiracy to commit money laundering and wire fraud. Earlier this month the UAW said that its president, Gary Jones, who had been linked to the ongoing corruption probe, was taking a leave of absence. Rory Gamble, the union’s acting head, said last week he will examine every department of the union in response to the spreading federal corruption probe to prevent future misuse of members’ dues."
-6.282649215956022," Ford uses Mustang name, hoping new electric SUV will zap Tesla (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co F.N will tag its new electric sport utility vehicle (SUV) with the Mustang name, the automaker said on Thursday, seeking to entice customers into a new era by linking it to the model whose groundbreaking design in the 1960s combined sportiness and affordability. Ford confirmed its new electric SUV will be called the Mustang Mach-E ahead of a debut event scheduled for Los Angeles on Sunday. Until now, the Mustang name has been used only on a line of sporty coupes associated with Detroit’s 1960s muscle car era. Customers in the United States, Canada and Europe can start ordering the electric vehicles on Nov. 17, Ford said. While Mustang coupes are built in Michigan, the Mach E will be built at a factory in Cuatitlan, Mexico. The Mach E is the first of a more than dozen all-electric automobiles the company plans to launch by 2022 with an investment of $11.5 billion as it moves away from traditional gasoline-powered cars. Electric vehicle market leader Tesla IncTSLA.O has used speed and power to sell its vehicles, along with upgradable software and big display screens. Using the Mustang name signals that Ford intends to do the same, leaving behind the prior strategy of positioning electric vehicles as practical, “green” cars. Competition for electric vehicle customers will intensify over the next several years as more mainstream automakers launch electric models, and Tesla expands into new market segments. Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk has said he will unveil a high-performance electric pickup truck at an event in Los Angeles on Nov. 21, coinciding with the Los Angeles Auto Show. Ford and General Motors Co GM.N are working on electric pickup trucks as well. In April, the No. 2 U.S. carmaker invested $500 million in electric automaker Rivian and said it planned to use the Michigan startup’s platform to build a new Ford-branded electric vehicle. Ford has also formed an alliance with Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE to use the German automaker's compact electric vehicle platform for new vehicles in Europe. A reservation for the Mustang Mach-E can be made on Ford’s website in the United States, Canada and Europe by paying a refundable deposit of $500, the company said. Ford said it would announce reservation dates for China later. (This story adds dropped word in first paragraph)"

-8.761885283202096," Trump nominates former Ford executive to be new U.S. energy secretary WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Energy said on Thursday that President Donald Trump had formally nominated Deputy Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette, a former vice president of Ford Motor Co and Louisiana state energy regulator, to head the department. If confirmed by the Senate, Brouillette will replace Rick Perry, who said last month he would step down by the end of the year. He is expected to keep advancing Trump’s policy of maximizing oil, gas and coal output while slashing regulations on energy facilities. “If confirmed, I will further Secretary Perry’s legacy of promoting energy independence, innovation, and security for the American people,” Brouillette said in a statement. Brouillette, 57, has taken on increasing responsibilities at the Energy Department in recent months as Perry signaled he would resign. He went on international trips for the department and sat in for Perry during several cabinet meetings. Brouillette was a vice president at Ford F.N from 2004 to 2006. After that, he headed public policy for the United Service Automobile Association (USAA), which offers insurance and financial services to veterans. A native of Louisiana, he was a member of the state’s Mineral and Energy Board from 2013 to 2016."
-7.222451846336134," Ford may consider making branded pickups in China if cities open more SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co F.N will consider building Ford-branded pickup trucks in China if restrictions on driving pickups in cities are relaxed and it could also roll out customized models at that time, a senior company official said. Ford was among foreign automakers exhibiting their wares this week at the China International Import Expo (CIIE) in Shanghai, a fair aimed at showcasing the country’s free trade credentials. Many of the vehicles that Ford, General Motors GM.N and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles FCHA.MI put on show were pickup trucks, a segment of the Chinese market that has remained relatively resilient even as the overall industry braces for a second year of dipping sales. Demand for pickups - both from traditional farm and construction-related customers as well as newer interest from general car buyers - has increased and last year China became the world’s second-biggest pickup truck market. But many big Chinese cities restrict pickups from entering their centers, an obstacle for sales growth. But some urban areas have relaxed the rules in recent years, boosting pickup sales. “If more areas relax restrictions on pickup trucks, we will plan to locally manufacture Ford-branded pickup trucks in China to meet the demands of Chinese consumers with considerations of the market situation,” Joseph Liu, Ford’s China vice president for product innovation, told Reuters on Wednesday. The Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker does not build Ford-branded pickup trucks in China, but its local partner, JMC 000550.SZ, in which Ford has a 32% stake, manufactures Yuhu series pickups with Ford technology. Liu did not provide details about manufacturing plans or model specifications but said made-in-China Ford pickup trucks would be different from existing imported models, if and when Ford went ahead with the plans. For instance, China-made pickup trucks would be of sizes that are suitable for China’s roads and are less likely to have capacity for towing trailers as current policies limit that. Other automakers at CIIE told Reuters this week they were there to test the waters. GM and FCA also displayed their new pickup models such as the Chevrolet Silverado, GMC Sierra Denali, and Jeep Gladiator. FCA representatives said the company planned to launch the Gladiator in China but was still working on adjusting the model to meet regulatory requirements on things like emissions. A spokeswoman for GM said the company wanted to showcase American-style pickup trucks in Shanghai to get public opinion. She said, however, that GM had no plan to launch these models in China now."

2.7302567718744286," UAW union leaders recommend approval of Ford labor deal DETROIT (Reuters) - United Auto Workers leaders from Ford Motor Co’s U.S. plants on Friday recommended approval of a tentative labor agreement that would allow the No. 2 U.S. automaker to avoid a strike like the one that cost its larger rival General Motors Co about $3 billion. The union turned to Ford to negotiate a new four-year agreement after ratifying a contract last week with GM following a 40-day U.S. strike that shut down almost all of that company’s North American operations. Ford and the UAW quickly reached a tentative deal on Wednesday. “This contract continues a strong pattern that gives all workers a path to traditional wages and maintains the job security and benefits our members deserve,” UAW President Gary Jones said in a statement. Ford confirmed the deal in a statement and declined further comment. The deal now must be ratified by the 55,000 UAW workers at Ford, with voting running through Nov. 15. While GM’s deal was approved, ratification is not a sure thing, as union members at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV in 2015 rejected the first version of a contract. Detailed terms of the Ford deal echoed those agreed to with GM, as the union typically uses the first deal as a pattern for those that follow. The UAW said the deal included agreements by Ford to invest more than $6 billion in its U.S. plants, and to create or retain more than 8,500 UAW jobs. The spending includes a $1.1 billion investment in Ford’s Wayne, Michigan, pickup truck plant; $1 billion for the Louisville, Kentucky, plant, where Ford makes pickups and SUVs; and $900 million in an Ohio plant where it produces heavy-duty pickup trucks. A new unnamed vehicle will be added to the Ohio plant in 2023. The deal also includes building hybrid and fully electric versions of various SUV models and the best-selling F-150 pickup truck, the union said. Full-time UAW members at Ford will receive a signing bonus of $9,000, but the deal will allow the Dearborn, Michigan, company to close an engine plant in Romeo, Michigan. The deal includes pay raises and lump-sum payments over the life of the contract, a pathway to full-time employment for temporary employees and unchanged healthcare coverage. Once the Ford deal is ratified, the UAW will turn to Fiat Chrysler to complete its quadrennial talks with the Detroit automakers. The talks have at times been overshadowed by an ongoing federal corruption probe that has involved several UAW senior leaders and been linked to Jones.

0.8998735777207624," UAW union leaders recommend approval of Ford labor deal DETROIT, Nov 1 (Reuters) - United Auto Workers leaders from Ford Motor Co’s U.S. plants on Friday recommended approval of a tentative labor agreement that would allow the No. 2 U.S. automaker avoid a strike like the one that cost its larger rival General Motors Co about $3 billion. The union turned to Ford to negotiate a new four-year agreement after ratifying a contract last week with GM following a 40-day U.S. strike that shut down almost all of that company’s North American operations. Ford and the UAW quickly reached a tentative deal on Wednesday. The deal now must be ratified by the 55,000 UAW workers at Ford, with voting running through Nov. 15. While GM’s deal was approved, ratification is not a sure thing, as union members at Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV in 2015 rejected the first version of a contract.

0.8998735777207624," Ford plans to close engine plant in Michigan as part of UAW deal WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co plans to close an engine plant in Romeo, Michigan, as part of a tentative agreement with the United Auto Workers union for a new four-year contract, a source told Reuters on Thursday. The 600 hourly workers at the plant will be offered jobs at a nearby transmission plant or buyouts, a source said. The UAW said Wednesday the Ford deal “secured over $6 billion in major product investments in American facilities, creating and retaining over 8,500 jobs for our communities.” Ford will close the plant in the future under the UAW agreement. Ford and the UAW declined to comment. In March 2017, Ford said it was investing $150 million in the Romeo Engine Plant to boost capacity for engines and new tooling for components, one of three Michigan plants at the time it said were getting new investments. Ford said the investment was to boost the plant building engines for vehicles that include Ford Super Duty, E-Series, Ford Shelby GT 350 Mustang and Shelby GT350R Mustang, along with components for F-Series, Mustang, Explorer and Edge. In 2017 U.S. President Donald Trump praised Ford’s decision to invest in Romeo and two other Michigan plants. “Major investment to be made in three Michigan plants,” Trump posted on Twitter at the time. “Car companies coming back to U.S. JOBS! JOBS! JOBS!” In contrast to Ford, General Motors Co endured a 40-day-strike by its U.S. hourly workforce that cost it about $3 billion before winning approval for a new labor deal earlier this month. Detailed terms of the Ford deal were not released, but they are expected to echo those agreed to with GM, as the union typically uses the first deal as a pattern for those that follow. The deal includes a signing bonus of $9,000 per person, according to a person familiar with the deal who asked not to be identified. Union members at GM received $11,000 per person. UAW leaders from the various U.S. plants will meet on Friday to potentially approve the deal, which then would be sent to the 55,000 members at Ford for final approval, a union spokesman said."

5.27329913062595," Ford shutters oldest Brazil plant as revival bid faces doubts SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co F.N on Wednesday said it was shutting down its oldest plant in Brazil later in the day as planned, with prospects for saving any of the jobs in doubt as talks with a potential buyer have fallen behind schedule. The plant, located in the industrial suburb of Sao Bernardo do Campo, produced buses and the Fiesta compact car, which sold poorly. It employed up to 2,800 people earlier this year, although it is unclear how many were still working there as of October. Ford first announced it would shut down the plant in February, and said it had failed to find a buyer. But then the Sao Paulo government intervened and a local automaker, CAOA, expressed interest. CAOA, Ford and the Sao Paulo state government announced in September that they had reached a preliminary deal, but needed 45 days to carry out due diligence. That time period has already expired, and neither side has provided an explanation. CAOA declined to comment. CAOA got its start as a Ford dealership, but expanded into manufacturing with a contract with Hyundai and later bought 50% of Chinese automaker Chery’s [CHERY.UL] operation in Brazil. While Brazil is a base for many multinational automakers, CAOA is the rare manufacturer to be locally owned."

1.9495387431710636," UAW turns to Ford after GM workers approve new contract DETROIT/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers union said on Friday it has chosen Ford Motor Co F.N as the next U.S. automaker the union will negotiate with after workers at General Motors Co GM.N approved a new contract deal. The UAW said 57% of hourly workers at GM voted to approve the deal to end a contentious 40-day U.S. strike, the longest automotive labor stoppage since 1970. GM Chairman and Chief Executive Mary Barra said in a statement the new contract “recognizes our employees for the important contributions they make to the overall success of the company, with a strong wage and benefit package and additional investment and job growth in our U.S. operations.” The UAW and Ford, the second-largest U.S. automaker, will begin talks on Monday, the union said. Ford and the UAW said earlier this month they had made “significant progress” in addressing many bargaining issues. Ford said on Friday it looks “forward to reaching a fair agreement that helps Ford enhance its competitiveness and preserve and protect good-paying manufacturing jobs.” Unlike GM, Ford has not signaled it wants to close plants, but executives have said future electric vehicles would require 30% fewer labor hours to build. UAW leaders have expressed concern about the impact of EVs on their members. GM also did little to lower its share of the UAW’s healthcare plans, which could be more costly to Ford since it employs about 55,000 UAW members in the United States. The UAW had previously agreed to a temporary contract extension with Ford while it focused on GM. While the talks between GM and the UAW grew tense at times, with the union accusing the automaker of trying to “starve ... workers off the picket lines,” Ford historically has had an easier relationship with the union. Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford has described the UAW as “family” in the past and in September 2018 hailed the No. 2 U.S. automaker’s relationship with its hourly workers. “The UAW doesn’t just make our workers better, it makes Ford better and stronger,” Bill Ford told UAW workers last year. Workers at GM will begin to go back as early as Saturday under the new four-year contract, ending the strike that cost the No. 1 U.S. automaker more than $2 billion and costing the automaker about 300,000 units of lost production. GM will attempt to make up some of that production in the coming months. The union wrung higher pay and other benefits from GM as part of the deal to end the strike by about 48,000 workers. UAW leaders had recommended that the members at GM, who have remained on the picket lines, ratify the deal reached on Oct. 16. The GM strike began on Sept. 16, with UAW negotiators seeking higher pay for workers, greater job security, a bigger share of profit and protection of healthcare benefits. Other issues included the fate of plants GM targeted to close, as well as the use of lower-paid temporary workers. The strike at GM likely slashed at least 46,000 jobs from October’s nonfarm U.S. payrolls, the Labor Department said on Friday. Under the deal, GM will invest $9 billion in the United States, including $7.7 directly in its plants, with the rest going to joint ventures. The Detroit company said it will also create or retain 9,000 UAW jobs, a substantial portion of which will be new, a source previously said. The contract offers $11,000 signing bonuses to members, and pay raises.

-0.7600386352144624," Ford cuts full-year profit outlook as third-quarter profit dips DEARBORN, Mich. (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co F.N on Wednesday cut its forecast for operating profit for the year after a disappointing third quarter that Chief Executive Jim Hackett blamed on higher warranty costs, bigger discounts and weaker than expected performance in China. Investors sold off Ford shares, which fell 2.5% to $8.98 in after-hours trading while shares in electric car maker Tesla Inc TSLA.O surged more than 20% on better than expected results. In a conference call with analysts, Hackett said Ford “experienced more headwinds” than expected in the quarter. “As a result, we will not grow adjusted EBIT this year as we intended,” Hackett said, referring to earnings before interest and taxes. The disappointing financial results are a setback for Hackett, the former CEO of office furniture maker Steelcase, who took over Ford in May 2017 after the abrupt ouster of Ford veteran Mark Fields. For two years, Hackett has been asking investors to be patient with a methodical restructuring that has made progress, including a wide-ranging alliance on electric vehicles with Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE and the sale of money-losing operations in India to a venture controlled by Indian automaker Mahindra & Mahindra MAHN.NS. But by Ford’s own reckoning, most of the restructuring work has yet to be done. It has booked only $3.3 billion of the projected $11 billion in charges it previously said it would take for the global restructuring, up from $2.2 billion at the end of the second quarter. The company also suffered a bumpy introduction of the redesigned Ford Explorer and all-new Lincoln Aviator in the quarter, said Joe Hinrichs, Ford’s president of automotive. “We were disappointed in the overall performance,” he told analysts, referring to the uneven vehicle launch and production ramp-up at an aging Chicago assembly plant. “We took on too much,” said Hinrichs, citing the difficulty of launching the Explorer and Aviator simultaneously while it was breaking in a new assembly line at the 95-year-old Chicago plant. “We have plenty of inventory now at dealers,” he added. The third quarter included $1.5 billion in costs for the company’s global restructuring, $800 million of which was related to the formation of a joint venture in India with Mahindra. Ford’s ongoing restructuring includes cutting costs and overhauling its product lineup in key global markets like China and Europe. The No. 2 U.S. automaker still faces the prospect of negotiating a new four-year labor agreement with the United Auto Workers following the union's more than month-long strike against General Motors Co GM.N, which cost GM about $2 billion according to analysts. Ford reported a third-quarter net profit of $425 million, or 11 cents a share, compared with $991 million, or 25 cents a share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time charges, Ford earned 34 cents a share, above the 26 cents analysts had expected according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Revenue in the quarter fell 2% to $37 billion, above the $33.98 billion expected. Virtually all of Ford's third-quarter pretax profit came from North America - its most lucrative market - where highly profitable pickup trucks drive margins for the Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker and its Detroit rivals, GM and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV. FCHA.MI Ford said Wednesday it now expects a full-year adjusted operating profit in the range of $6.5 billion to $7 billion, compared with $7 billion last year. In July, it had forecast an increase in the range of $7 billion to $7.5 billion. Ford also said it expects adjusted earnings this year in the range of $1.20 to $1.32 a share. Previously, the high end of its forecast had been $1.35. Analysts expect $1.26 a share. Ford’s third-quarter operating profit in North America was just over $2 billion. Its U.S. sales in the quarter fell 4.9%, but demand for lucrative pickups remained strong with an increase of almost 9%. China revenue in the quarter slid about $300 million to $900 million and Ford’s share in that market fell to 2.3% from 2.9% last year. Ford’s third-quarter sales in China fell 30% as it continued to lose ground in its second-biggest market. Ford has been struggling to revive sales in China since its business began slumping in late 2017. In September, Moody’s downgraded Ford’s credit rating to junk status - below what it rates larger rival GM - citing Ford’s operating and market challenges, and weak cash generation due to its global restructuring."

0.21882337206305452," Trump says he will nominate deputy to be new U.S. energy secretary WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday he would nominate Deputy Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette, a former vice president of Ford Motor Co and Louisiana state energy regulator, to head the department. “I am pleased to nominate Deputy Secretary Dan Brouillette to be the new Secretary of Energy,” Trump wrote in a post on Twitter. “Dan’s experience in the sector is unparalleled. A total professional, I have no doubt that Dan will do a great job!” If confirmed by the Senate, Brouillette will replace Rick Perry, who said on Thursday he would step down by the end of the year. Brouillette, 57, has taken on increasing responsibilities at the Energy Department in recent months as Perry signaled he would resign. He went on international trips for the department and sat in for Perry during several Cabinet meetings. Brouillette was vice president at Ford F.N from 2004 to 2006. After that, he headed public policy for United Service Automobile Association (USAA) which offers insurance and financial services to veterans. A native of Louisiana, he was a member of the state’s Mineral and Energy Board from 2013 to 2016. Before that he served at the Energy Department as an assistant secretary for congressional and intergovernmental affairs for two years under former President George W. Bush. Joe McMonigle, who was a department chief of staff under Bush, said Brouillette does not have the instincts of a politician like Perry, who had been the longest-serving governor of Texas. But like Perry, Brouillette has an easy relationship with many Democratic and Republican lawmakers, McMonigle said. Brouillette, who met with Trump on Friday, is expected to keep pushing the president’s policy of maximizing oil, gas and coal output while slashing regulations on energy facilities. “I don’t know of a single issue where he differs from the president,” McMonigle said."

7.082074863706193," Ford's China sales decline again despite new models BEIJING (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co's F.N July-to-September vehicle sales in China fell 30%, as the U.S. automaker continued to lose ground in a prolonged sales decline in its second biggest market. The Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker delivered 131,060 vehicles in China in the third quarter, Ford said in a statement. Ford’s sales in China fell 35.8% in the first quarter and by 21.7% in the second quarter. In the third quarter, sales of the automaker’s mass-market Ford brand fell 37.7%, while its luxury division Lincoln saw sales drop by 24.1%. It delivered around 421,000 vehicles in the first nine months of the year, according to Reuters calculations. Ford has been struggling to revive sales in China after its business began slumping in late 2017. Sales sank 37 percent in 2018, after a 6 percent decline in 2017. The automaker plans to launch more than 30 new models in China over the next three years of which more than a third will be electric vehicles. It also said it would localize management teams by hiring more Chinese staff and aimed to improve relationships with joint venture partners. Ford has launched a series of new models in the third quarter in China, including Focus, sport-utility vehicle models Edge, and electric Territory. In China, Ford makes cars through its joint venture with Chongqing Changan Automobile Co Ltd 000625.SZ and Jiangling Motors Corp Ltd (JMC) 000550.SZ. It has said it would partner with Zotye Automobile Co Ltd 000980.SZ to sell lower priced cars, but there seems to have not been little progress. In a series of moves, Ford named a new president for its main local venture, Changan Ford, in August and said it would enhance its partnership with Changan through research, production and marketing cooperation in September. Ford is also planning to revamp some of its existing manufacturing facilities with Changan to localize production of its premium brand Lincoln. Changan Ford’s sales down by around 33.5% in the third quarter, according to Reuters calculations based on Changan’s filings. Ford's rival General Motors Co's GM.N July to September vehicle sales in China also fell 17.5% to 689,531 vehicles. As GM and Ford China sales extend declines, U.S. car companies’ share of total China passenger vehicle sales fell to 9.5% in the first eight months of this year from 10.7% in the year-ago period, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM). Over the same period, German car makers’ share has risen to 23.8% from 21.6% and Japanese auto makers’ to 21.7% from 18.3%. Annual industry car sales in China fell last year for the first time since the 1990s, and they are expected to fall this year too. Sales dropped 6.9% in August from the same month in the prior year, CAAM said. An official at the association said last month that in the next three years the industry could see “low or small negative growth”."

7.475886724810063," UAW cites 'significant progress' in Ford talks as GM strike continues WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers union said on Thursday it has made ""significant progress"" in contract talks with Ford Motor Co F.N, even as a strike at General Motors Co GM.N is in its third week. The UAW agreed to extend contracts with Ford and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCHA.MI as it focused first on GM. About 48,000 UAW members at GM went on strike on Sept. 16 seeking higher pay, greater job security, a bigger share of the leading U.S. automaker’s profit and protection of healthcare benefits. [nL2N2680Z7] JP Morgan auto analyst Ryan Brinkman estimated in a research note this week the strike has cost GM over $1 billion but it may be able to recover some lost profit in the fourth quarter. He said GM is losing $82 million a day. GM shares are down nearly 12% since the strike began. LMC automotive estimated on Thursday GM has lost production of 118,000 vehicles through Oct. 2. But GM has 81 days’ supply of vehicles in stock for the United States, and 90 days’ worth of Chevrolet Silverado pickup trucks. GM said earlier this week the strike by U.S. workers forced it to halt production at its pickup and transmission plants in Silao, Mexico, resulting in temporary layoffs of 6,000 workers. [nL2N26M1C7] The UAW on Tuesday rejected a new comprehensive offer from GM and the sides have been exchanging counterproposals over the last few days. The statements on “comprehensive proposals” indicate the talks have shifted into a higher gear as the dispute is taking a toll on both the automaker and striking UAW workers, whose individual compensation of $250 a week from the union strike fund is a fraction of their normal pay. Both sides face broader risks should the U.S. economy slow down. Data released on Tuesday showed the U.S. manufacturing sector contracted in September to its weakest level in more than a decade. Stocks fell broadly on the report. [nL3N26M3M6] The strike had previously forced GM to lay off at least 2,000 Canadian workers and temporarily close an engine plant in Mexico. Many suppliers have halted or scaled back some operations. The UAW said 18 out of 20 Ford subcommittees have reached tentative agreements or made significant progress. Ford said it is focused on “reaching a fair agreement with the UAW that allows the company to be more competitive so we can continue to preserve and protect good-paying manufacturing jobs.”"
11.203202084586943," Pick-up trucks remain mainstay for Detroit Three in third quarter (Reuters) - The Big Three U.S. automakers on Wednesday reported a rise in sales of pick-up trucks for the third quarter as lower interest rates boosted demand in an otherwise sluggish auto market. Shares of General Motors GM.N, Ford Motor F.N and Fiat Chrysler FCHA.MI were, however, trading lower, tracking a broad selloff in the market over fears of a U.S. slowdown. While higher vehicle prices and rising interest rates earlier in the year kept car shoppers on the sidelines, recent interest rate cuts helped sales in the third quarter. Automakers in the United States are also focusing on selling larger SUVs and trucks that are more profitable, as sedans fall out of favor. “Gas prices and interest rates remain at historically low levels ... (and) support our industry to 17 million plus level for what is now the fifth straight year,” Mark LaNeve, Ford’s vice president of U.S. marketing, sales and service, said on a call with analysts. There were concerns that GM’s sales could take a hit after 48,000 hourly employees at the top U.S. automaker walked out for the first time in 12 years on Sept. 16 and remain on strike. GM did not face a severe inventory crunch in the third quarter, as most dealers showed healthy supply levels heading into October, according to an analysis by automotive shopping website CarGurus. However, the company risks facing parts shortage that could possibly affect sales in the current quarter, likely benefiting rivals including Ford. Sales of Silverado pick-up trucks jumped 16.6% to 155,482 vehicles, boosting GM’s total U.S. sales by 6.3% to 738,638 vehicles. Sales of Ford’s pick-up trucks rose 5% to 240,387, their best third-quarter performance in 14 years, even as overall sales fell 4.9% to 580,251 units, hurt by lower demand for the company’s passenger cars including the Taurus sedan. Fiat Chrysler’s sales of its Ram pick-up trucks surged 14% to 161,635, marginally lifting overall sales by 0.1% to 565,034 units. GM’s sales fell slightly short of U.S. car shopping website Edmunds’ forecast of 748,746 vehicles, while Ford and Fiat Chrysler beat expectations. Edmunds had expected third-quarter sales for the industry to rise by 0.8% to 4.3 million vehicles, led by volume gains at GM.

7.5797311689955755," Ford ties up with Mahindra in India to cut risks and costs MUMBAI/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co and Mahindra & Mahindra said on Tuesday they would form a joint venture in India, in a move aimed at reducing risks for the U.S. automaker’s local business and cutting the cost of developing and producing vehicles for emerging markets. The venture, valued at $275 million, will see Ford F.N enlist Mahindra MAHM.NS as a partner for developing and selling vehicles in India and emerging markets using the U.S. automaker's production facilities in the country. By shifting to a joint venture, Ford is also changing its strategy for India, where it has long run an independent operation. The South Asian nation, where auto sales are slumping, once promised growth for global carmakers, many of which are now frustrated after working hard to gain a foothold. Ford’s decision comes at a time when Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration is trying to boost local manufacturing by cutting corporate tax rates and offering cheap loans to push car sales. Under pressure from shareholders to make profits, Ford has been globally restructuring its businesses with an aim to save $11 billion over the next few years. Ford President and CEO Jim Hackett said the partnership was “not only a fitness objective” but also gave the automaker a platform to expand in a market like India, where it wished it had done things differently. “We have other emerging markets where we need to apply the same kind of understanding,” Hackett told reporters in Mumbai over a video conference from Dearborn, Michigan. Ford, which has invested more than $2 billion in India over two decades, will take an $800 million to $900 million non-cash charge to reflect the writedown of its Indian assets, it said in a separate exchange filing. By shelving efforts to go it alone in emerging markets, including India, Ford will save capital for more urgent and potentially profitable endeavours - such as defending its U.S. truck franchise or fixing its operations in China. Ford has also executed a significant alliance with Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE to share the costs of electric cars, commercial vehicles and developing autonomous vehicles. “I think it’s a disappointment when I see Ford sitting at the passenger seat, while Mahindra drives, if that will be the arrangement,” said Gaurav Vangaal, senior analyst, automotive forecasting at consultancy IHS Markit. “But looking at a global scenario of rapid transformation in powertrains and a shift to electric, this is a better way to mitigate investment risks,” he added. The two companies have for months been negotiating the deal which will see Ford take a 49% stake in the new entity, ending most of its independent India operations, Reuters reported in April. Under the terms of the deal, which is likely to be finalised by mid-2020, Ford will transfer its local automotive assets, including both car manufacturing plants, and employees to the new entity, the companies said. Ford will retain its engine plant at Sanand in western India and global business center in Chennai in the south. The new entity, which will be operationally managed by Mahindra, will develop and sell Ford brand vehicles in India and export Ford and Mahindra brand vehicles to emerging markets. Mahindra will bring its sourcing, supply chain and Indian market knowledge to the table and will in return get access to Ford’s global reach and technology. “These synergies lead to sizable business opportunities to create new products, leverage brand and distribution assets, enter new markets and seize leadership,” said Anand Mahindra, chairman of Mahindra Group. In India, Ford currently manufactures and sells its cars via its wholly owned subsidiary. In 2017 it formed a strategic alliance with Mahindra under which, among other things, they would develop new cars together. The companies expect to launch three new utility vehicles under the joint venture, starting with a midsize SUV. They are also jointly developing electric vehicles for emerging markets. Michigan-based Ford has a share of just about 3% in a market dominated by Asian car makers including Suzuki Motor Corp 7269.T and Hyundai Motor Co 005380.KS that together control two-thirds."

The U.S. automaker previously said it would begin transporting people and goods in automated vehicles in Miami and Washington. Ford's self-driving system, now being tested in Fusion Hybrid sedans, is being jointly developed with Argo AI, a Pittsburgh-based startup in which Ford and Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE together hold a majority stake. Sherif Marakby, chief executive of Ford Autonomous Vehicles, said Ford plans to launch the commercial transportation service in 2021 in a purpose-built hybrid vehicle that can be equipped to carry either people or goods. Peter Rander, president of Argo AI, said development teams soon will be manually driving the Fusion test vehicles in Austin, mapping the city streets and assessing driver and pedestrian behaviors ahead of the commercial launch. Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Waymo last year introduced an automated ride service with human attendants in Phoenix, using specially outfitted Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans it buys from Fiat Chrysler Automobiles FCHA.MI. General Motors Co's GM.N Cruise Automation said in July it planned to delay commercial deployment of automated vehicles in San Francisco beyond its initial target of 2019 because more testing was required."
4.403123518624706," Ford close to JV deal with Mahindra in India: sources NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co F.N and Mahindra & Mahindra MAHM.NS are likely to sign a deal next week to form a joint venture in India, two sources told Reuters, in a move that will see the U.S. carmaker end most of its independent operations in the country. The two companies have for months been structuring the deal to create a new entity in which Ford will hold a 49% stake, while Indian rival Mahindra will own 51%, Reuters reported in April. Under the deal Ford will transfer most of its automotive assets and employees in India to the new company, but the carmaker will retain an engine plant in Sanand in the western state of Gujarat, according to the two sources, who asked not to be named as the talks are private. A Ford spokeswoman did not comment directly on the deal, but said the company was engaged with Mahindra “to develop avenues of strategic cooperation that help us achieve commercial, manufacturing and business efficiencies”. Mahindra did not respond to a request for comment. By shifting to a joint venture, Ford is changing its decades-old India strategy focused on running an independent operation. Under pressure from shareholders to make profits, the U.S. carmaker has been globally restructuring its businesses with an aim to save $11 billion over the next few years. Ford’s decision is a setback for the country at a time when Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration is trying to boost local manufacturing by cutting corporate tax rates and offering cheap loans to push car sales. Sale of cars by manufacturers to dealers have fallen at their steepest pace in two decades. Ford’s two manufacturing plants - one in Chennai in southern India and the other in Sanand which was inaugurated in 2015 - will be moved to the new joint venture, but Ford will keep the engine plant at Sanand. Together, they have a maximum annual manufacturing capacity of 440,000 vehicles. Ford-brand cars will continue to be built and sold in India and exported by the new company, one of the sources said. Over two decades, Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford invested more than $2 billion in India but it has consistently struggled - it currently has a share of about 3% in a market where Maruti Suzuki MRTI.NS is the top player with a 50% share. “The Mahindra deal is an opportunity for Ford to recover some of the money it has invested in India,” said one of the sources. In India, currently, Ford manufactures and sells its cars via its wholly owned subsidiary.

-0.7251085956472414," Scandal-hit UAW agrees to contract extensions with Ford, FCA DETROIT/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United Auto Workers union agreed to temporary contract extensions with Ford Motor Co and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV on Friday as it grappled with a federal corruption probe that has implicated its president. But a Saturday midnight deadline for the UAW to agree on a new four-year labor contract with General Motors Co currently remains in place, a union spokesman said. UAW President Gary Jones and his predecessor were two of the unnamed officials singled out in a federal criminal complaint released Thursday detailing alleged corruption and embezzlement by union leaders, a source familiar with the matter said on Friday. The complaint has raised questions, not only about the once powerful union’s leadership, but about the status of the collective bargaining talks with Detroit’s automakers. The complaint detailed charges against Jones’ former second in command and successor as head of the UAW’s “Region 5,” Vance Pearson. It also referred frequently to several unnamed figures, in particular “Official A” who is Jones, and “Official B,” his predecessor Dennis Williams, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The union had targeted GM, the largest U.S. automaker, as the one it wanted to conclude contract talks with and set a pattern for subsequent agreements with Ford and Fiat Chrysler This year’s talks were widely expected to be contentious, focusing on thorny issues like healthcare costs and profit-sharing at a time when U.S. new vehicle sales are declining. But according to sources briefed on the matter, the searing complaint throws into question whether talks will continue between GM and the UAW ahead of the Saturday deadline. Two people briefed on the matter say GM may ask for a temporary extension of the contract and could pursue other options including seeking assistance from a third party. It was not clear if the talks with GM will continue with the current UAW president under investigation. In a statement, Ford said it agreed with the union to extend the contract talks while the focus “remains on reaching a fair agreement with the UAW.” Rory Gamble, the official who oversees the UAW’s relations with Ford, said a contract extension was “not unusual and commonly occurs when another company has been identified as the lead.” Neither Jones nor Williams has been charged with any wrongdoing. The UAW did not comment on reports implicating the two, which first surfaced in the Detroit News. The union had hoped to put the growing federal probe behind it by electing Jones, a former regional director for the union, as president in 2018. However, Thursday’s arrest implicated the second in command in the region Jones ran. Jones was chosen as he seemed far removed from the scandal. But two weeks ago, the FBI raided Jones’s home, a union retreat and multiple other locations as part of the corruption probe. The federal complaint filed on Thursday said government agents had seized $30,000 in cash from the residence of Official A. A lawyer for Jones could not immediately be reached for comment on Friday."

-0.7251085956472414," Ford, GM rev up electric pickup trucks to head off Tesla DETROIT (Reuters) - Large pickup trucks that tow most of the profits in to Ford Motor Co and General Motors Co are holdovers from another century - with heavy ladder frames and big internal combustion engines in the front driving the wheels in the back. Now, Ford and GM are racing to design radical new takes on their most profitable models, replacing petroleum-fueled engines with batteries in a bid to outflank Tesla Inc’s plan to eclipse their brands. Ford’s F-150 pickup and GM’s Chevrolet Silverado are the top selling vehicles in the U.S. market. “This is going to be a real watershed for the whole industry,” Ford Chairman Bill Ford told Reuters in a recent interview. The automaker has disclosed few details about the electric F-series, but Bill Ford hinted the truck could have load-carrying space under the hood in addition to the traditional bed in the back. “You pick up all that extra space where the engine compartment has been,” Ford said. An electric F-Series could be a work truck - with its batteries functioning as a job site power source, he said. And it could be positioned as a high-performance vehicle next to the gas-fueled, 450 horsepower Raptor pickup truck. The Dearborn, Michigan-based company has said it will invest $11.5 billion electrifying its vehicles by 2022, including adding 16 fully electric models, all of which will be profitable. Ford and GM have more than one reason to take chances on electric pickups - a concept that some analysts and industry executives say could be a small niche. Electric pickups could help Ford and GM generate the significant sales of EVs they will need to meet tougher emission standards and electric vehicle mandates in California and other states. The Trump administration is moving to roll back those standards, but the electric trucks are a hedge if California prevails. Governments and corporations - major buyers of pickups - could view electric pickups as a way to show a commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Competition from Tesla and EV startups Rivian Automotive and Workhorse Group Inc is another factor, although Ford recently mitigated some of that risk by investing $500 million in Rivian. Three years ago, Tesla CEO Elon Musk declared he wanted to attack the heart of the Detroit automakers’ franchises with a Tesla electric pickup he has described as a “cyberpunk” truck with the performance of a Porsche 911 sports car. Tesla is expected to unveil a prototype this year, with analysts forecasting a 2022 debut. Musk declined to comment for this story. Officials familiar with Ford and GM’s plans said their electric pickups will be introduced by early 2022. “Our strategy is very clear,” Ted Cannis, Ford’s director of electrification, told Reuters at the No. 2 U.S. automaker’s product development center outside Detroit. “We’re going to play to our strengths. We’re good at pickups.” Ford’s electric truck will be built on a company EV platform separate from the vehicles it will offer later on a Rivian platform. Ford has said it will introduce a hybrid F-150 next year. Bill Ford said the all-electric F-150 “won’t be too far after that.” At GM, Chief Executive Mary Barra said in April the automaker would make an electric full-size pickup, but provided no further details. The company has said it plans to invest $8 billion to develop electric and self-driving vehicles, launching 20 new EVs globally by 2023. Officials have not discussed plans for the electric pickup, but GM is pushing to introduce it within two years, according to several people familiar with the plans. The lead engineer is Josh Tavel, who was the chief engineer for the Chevy Volt, Cadillac ELR, and Spark and Bolt EVs as well as executive chief engineer for full-size pickups, GM said. Rivian CEO R.J. Scaringe believes positive reaction last fall for his company’s R1T electric truck, due in fall 2020, shows the potential demand. “The question is how large is the demand and does it translate across all price points or does it stay more isolated in the higher price points?” he told Reuters at the company’s Plymouth, Michigan, headquarters. Ford officials will not discuss sales expectations for the electric F-150. But Bill Ford said the electric pickup could outperform conservative expectations - if prospective customers try it. Ford has broken with pickup segment conventions before - substituting a turbo-charged six-cylinder “EcoBoost” engine for the traditional V-8, and then giving the current generation of the truck an aluminum body instead of steel, the chairman said. The aluminum F-series is the best-selling pickup truck line in the United States, and about half are equipped with six-cylinder engines. “Like it was with EcoBoost and like it was with aluminum, it’s important we get people in the vehicle to try it,” Ford said. Beau Boeckmann, president of Galpin Ford in the Los Angeles area and one of the largest U.S. Ford dealers, said customers are already asking about the truck. “We’re going to be shocked,” he said. “I think the electric pickup truck has a huge future.” Not everyone is so sanguine. Industry tracking firm IHS Markit has estimated the entire full-size electric truck segment will account for fewer than 30,000 sales in 2026, compared with an expected 2.3 million sales overall. “We’re in uncharted waters,” IHS Markit principal analyst Stephanie Brinley said. “We’re talking niche in the beginning.” Detroit’s other big automaker, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV , has no current plans for an all-electric Ram, while Toyota Motor Corp is betting more heavily on a hybrid Tundra pickup. “The sliver of volume that’s going to be electric pickups is not worthy of a business case,” said one person familiar with Toyota’s plans. The Detroit automakers ultimately want to defend a segment they see as their own. “Why would we let Tesla beat us with a pickup truck?” said one person familiar with Ford’s plans. “That’s our turf.”"
-2.1353421444874043," Ford makes big electric push in Europe with new launches (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Tuesday it would launch eight electric vehicles in Europe this year, a key step in its target of achieving a majority of its overall sales from electric cars by the end of 2022. The U.S. automaker is pushing into electric vehicles at a time when car manufacturers around the world are racing to slash carbon dioxide emissions in order to comply with more stringent environmental standards in the European Union. Ford’s launches include electric variants of the Kuga and Puma SUVs and the Mondeo sedan. The automaker also plans to launch nine other electric vehicles by 2024 in Europe, including a new Mustang-inspired electric sports utility vehicle next year. The automaker unveiled the models at the Frankfurt Motor Show in Germany, and said it would partner with six leading energy suppliers across Europe to provide home-charging wall box installation services. The carmaker, like its rivals, has been facing stagnant demand and rising costs as it invests billions of dollars in electric, hybrid and autonomous vehicles in efforts to boost sales. The company’s European business has been losing money for years and the pressure to restructure its operations increased after rival General Motors raised profits by selling its European Opel and Vauxhall brands to France’s Peugeot SA. In a bid to slash development and manufacturing costs, Ford tied up with Volkswagen <AG VOWG_p.DE> in July to jointly develop electric and self-driving vehicles. VW agreed to plow $3.1 billion into Ford’s Argo AI self-driving unit, but estimated it could realize up to $20 billion in revenue by sharing its MEB electric vehicle architecture with Ford in Europe. Ford had said it expects to build more than 600,000 electric vehicles in Europe over six years, sourcing components and the vehicle underpinnings from VW, helping both to cut costs. The cooperation with VW on electric vehicles in Europe is part of Ford’s previously disclosed $11.5 billion EV investment worldwide. The challenge of investing in low-emission vehicles while having to overhaul combustion engines to meet new clean-air rules, has forced Europe’s carmakers to slash fixed costs and streamline their model portfolios. The company will also introduce a smartphone app that will let its users and operators locate, navigate to and pay for charging.

-2.8206213096369526," Exclusive: In U-turn, Ford ditches plan to unify China sales system after partners push back SHANGHAI/DETROIT (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co has scrapped a plan to create a unified national sales company for China that stoked mistrust of the automaker at its joint venture partners and contributed to a spectacular collapse in sales in the world’s biggest car market. On the face of it, the plan announced by Ford in June last year to combine sales channels for vehicles manufactured with Chongqing Changan Automobile Co and Jiangling Motors Group made sense. It would promote operational efficiency at its loss-making China operations and is standard practice in most other markets. But it ignored realities on the ground. Chinese automakers, often in 50-50 partnerships with foreign car makers, are reluctant to lose control over sales decisions, rarely willing to trust each other and loyal to local provinces that are fiercely competitive in their quest for economic growth and tax revenues from vehicle sales. “I would say there was a lack of deep understanding on how relationships work in China,” Anning Chen, who in October took over as Ford’s third China chief in two years, said in an interview in Shanghai. It is the first time that Ford, grappling with a host of problems in China that present no quick fix, has disclosed the dropping of the plan - a decision also prompted by a sharp slowdown in China’s economic growth amid the trade war with the United States as well as deeper losses at dealerships. Many major foreign automakers have 2 or 3 partners in China, involving different marketing and distribution strategies for each partner. Ford is the only one known to have tried combining sales channels for mainstream cars. Other steps Ford is taking to turn around its China business include launching 30 new or significantly redesigned vehicles over the next three years, reductions in the number of temporary workers at plants, hiring more local Chinese, and putting profits before growth in market share. Capacity cuts as Ford and its partners embark on “right-sizing” their plants are also likely, Chen said. A recovery would help relieve pressure on the U.S. automaker which is also scrambling to end losses in Europe through plant closures and layoffs. It would also mitigate the risk that Ford ends up a marginal player in China - a market with annual sales of some 28 million vehicles that many foreign automakers now consider their most important. The slide in Ford’s sales has been unprecedented for a major global automaker in China. After a peak of 1.08 million vehicles in 2016, sales began faltering in late 2017, then nearly halved last year to 504,488, according to consultancy IHS Markit. IHS forecasts Ford’s sales will tumble further to 382,882 this year, while LMC Automotive predicts Ford’s China market share will fall to 1.4% compared to 3.8% in 2016. GRAPHIC: Ford's China sales collapse - Ford has publicly pinned the blame on an aging model lineup but company officials familiar with the matter said the breakdown in relationships with its joint venture partners and dealers as well as missteps by previous management teams were the bigger factors at play. For now, Ford’s main goal in China is profitability, Joe Hinrichs, president of Ford Automotive, told Reuters at the company’s Dearborn, Michigan headquarters. “You can be a profitable business in China with a relatively low market share because of...the size of the market,” he said. As signs of progress, Hinrichs pointed to dealer inventories at their lowest level in 18 months and a halving in first-half China losses before interest and tax to $283 million from the same period a year earlier. “This is not a five-year journey,” he said, but declined to be more specific when asked how soon Ford’s China unit is expected to regain profitability. Hinrichs, who became head of Ford’s auto business in May, helmed its Asia Pacific business from 2009 to 2011 - a period of strong growth for the automaker in China. Chen, a U.S. citizen who grew up in China and speaks fluent Mandarin, joined Ford in October from Chery Automobile Co. He is however, a Ford veteran, having worked for the firm for 17 years, mostly in Dearborn, prior to joining Chery. Highlighting the uneasy relationship that the joint venture partners have with each other and with Ford has been unhappiness over a cross distribution arrangement for a small sport-utility vehicle, the Territory. It was developed with JMC and sold not only through JMC Ford’s sales network but also through Changan Ford’s. The approach angered Changan, which wondered why it wasn’t the development partner and which as a bigger state-owned company considers itself far higher in pecking order than a regional firm like JMC, Ford company officials said. For its part, JMC was upset the product was shared with Changan, the officials added, declining to be identified as they were not authorised to speak publicly on the matter. Changan Ford, which makes the Ford EcoSport SUV, Focus small car and Mondeo sedan, did not respond to a request for comment. JMC, which builds the Territory and the Transit and Tourneo vans, declined to comment. While Ford previously touted the arrangement as a success, Chen was more circumspect, saying similar agreements were unlikely as they can create inconsistencies in dealer services. “We want to make sure distribution networks are directly facing different market segments and customers. We don’t want to mix them up,” he said. Ford is also aiming to build more cars locally, which will improve relations with domestic partners and help fill its woefully underused assembly plants. Cars likely to be built in China include the redesigned Ford Explorer and Lincoln Aviator SUVs. Ford used only 24% of its China production capacity to build 1.6 million vehicles in 2018, according to U.S. consultancy AlixPartners. Normally, rates of around 70% to 75% are considered the breakeven threshold. Ford declined to comment on its China capacity. PSA Group, also struggling in China with a 26% capacity utilization rate in 2018 according to AlixPartners, is shutting one plant, selling another and cutting thousands of jobs. Hinrichs said, however, that Ford doesn’t feel a “huge amount of pressure” to shutter any of its five China plants given that they are already paid for. Instead, by locally producing many of the upcoming new products, Ford will gain an opportunity to further adjust the installed capacity, he said."

Ford announced in February that it would shut down the plant, its oldest in Brazil, which employs some 3,000 workers, as part of a global restructuring and a push to exit the heavy truck business. CAOA and Ford have been negotiating the purchase since late February, Reuters reported at the time, when Sao Paulo state Governor Joao Doria rushed to find a buyer for the plant in a push to keep jobs in the city. Wagner Santana, president of the union that represents Ford’s workers, told reporters that in conversations with CAOA, the Brazilian automaker said it would initially retain only some 800 workers and that 1,300 would be let go, with the remainder being kept by Ford. Doria has defended Sao Paulo as a manufacturing hub at a time when the auto industry turned to other Brazilian states that were offering aggressive tax incentives. He has introduced a tax incentive of his own. At the news conference, Doria said a decision on how many jobs will be kept can only be made once Ford and CAOA close the sale, which is set to go through a 45-day due diligence process. “Preserve all jobs, that’s the fundamental condition for a contribution from the state,” Doria said, in reference to potential tax benefits. Santana said CAOA plans to pay those it hires up to 80% of their current Ford salaries, noting that is still much more than salaries paid in other states. A CAOA spokesperson declined to comment. “The objective is to make the factory profitable and productive, so it generates employment and riches,” said Carlos Alberto Oliveira Andrade, CAOA’s president and founder, whose initials make up the company name. Brazil’s large domestic market and protectionist economy has long attracted the world’s biggest automakers to set up shop here, and CAOA is the rare carmaker that is actually domestically owned. It has struck deals to make cars for Korea’s Hyundai and co-owns China’s Chery operation in Brazil, whose cars are branded as CAOA Chery. Ford opened the plant in 1967, and it is the company’s oldest in the country. It was primarily used to make heavy trucks, as well as the compact Ford Fiesta, a sales laggard. Ford is undergoing a global restructuring and has said it would focus on a much newer plant in the Northeastern state of Bahia."

A unanimous three-judge panel of the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said that while six of the seven named plaintiffs did not take the test, their reference to it in discrimination charges filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) was enough to put Ford on notice of their claim.

-0.04537290686308," Ford names new president for China joint venture to deepen alliance amid falling sales (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co F.N on Thursday named Steven Armstrong president of the Changan Ford joint venture in China to deepen the alliance and push for more models, as the U.S. carmaker tries to stem a decline in sales in the world's second largest economy. Sales of the joint venture with Chongqing-based Changan Automobile 000625.SZ continued to decline in July. In the first seven months of this year, the venture's sales dropped more than 60% compared to the same period a year earlier. Ford’s overall sales dropped 37% in 2018 in the world’s top auto market, mainly due to a lack of new products. Over the next three years, it plans to launch more than 30 new models in China, of which over a third will be electric vehicles. The venture is also planning to revamp some of its existing manufacturing facilities to localise production of Ford’s premium brand Lincoln. This would have a planned annual capacity of 70,000 Corsair sport-utility vehicles including 12,000 plug-in hybrid variants, according to a document on Chongqing city authorities’ website. “Steve’s leadership will help us further strengthen the Changan Ford JV as we bring more new vehicles to the China market, including our first global all-electric small SUV,” Ford Chief Executive Officer Jim Hackett said. Armstrong, the current chairman of Ford Europe, will begin his new role on Oct. 1, and report to Ford China President and CEO Anning Chen. Armstrong replaces Nigel Harris, who will retire at the end of 2019 after more than three decades with the U.S. automaker. In China, Ford also makes cars through Jiangling Motors Corp Ltd (JMC) 000550.SZ which it has a stake in. It has said it would partner with Zotye Automobile Co Ltd 000980.SZ to sell lower priced cars, but there seems not much progress. According to U.S. consulting firm AlixPartners, 2018 capacity utilisation rates at China assembly plants operated by Ford were below 50%. Normally, rates of around 70-75% are considered the break-even threshold."
-0.04537290686308," Trump attacks Ford Motor for not backing fuel economy rollback WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump stepped up a series of attacks on automakers on Wednesday for not backing his administration's plan to roll back Obama-era fuel efficiency rules, singling out Ford Motor Co F.N in particular for backing a deal with California for stricter fuel economy standards. Ford is one of four automakers, along with Honda Motor Co 7267.T, BMW AG BMWG.DE and Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE, that reached a voluntary agreement with California on fuel efficiency rules, defying Trump and his administration's effort to strip the state of the right to fight climate change by setting its own standards. The rules under the California plan are looser than the Obama-era regulations but stricter than what the Trump has proposed. Trump said company founder Henry Ford would be “very disappointed if he saw his modern-day descendants wanting to build a much more expensive car, that is far less safe and doesn’t work as well, because execs don’t want to fight California regulators.” Ford said in a statement that it is focused on acting to protect the environment while also protecting the affordability of vehicles. “This agreement with California provides regulatory stability while reducing CO2 more than complying with two different standards,” it said. There is no evidence that existing fuel economy rules would degrade vehicle performance. And environmentalists and many states challenge Trump’s assertion that his administration’s proposed rule would boost vehicle safety or dramatically reduce the price of vehicles -- and argue that consumers will save more in reduced fuel costs under the Obama rules. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra responded to Trump’s attacks on automakers saying it would result in an additional 540 million metric tons of greenhouse gases and other harms. “This doesn’t look like a better alternative to us,” he said. The White House has urged other automakers not to back the California agreement, while Democrats have been calling and writing automakers urging them to sign on with California. The Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday ridiculed the voluntary framework, which it said “so far has been nothing more than a press release.” “My proposal to the politically correct Automobile Companies would lower the average price of a car to consumers by more than $3000, while at the same time making the cars substantially safer. Engines would run smoother. Very little impact on the environment! Foolish executives!” Trump tweeted earlier. Gloria Bergquist, a spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers, representing General Motors Co GM.N, Toyota Motor Corp 7203.T, Ford, Volkswagen and others, said the companies ""look forward to seeing a final rule soon. We support increases to standards that optimize all the priorities, including affordability so more Americans can buy a new car, plus preserving jobs and safety at the same time."" GM has not backed the voluntary agreement, arguing that it does not properly credit the company’s electric vehicles. Even so, Trump tweeted that the founders of Ford and GM “are ‘rolling over’ at the weakness of current car company executives” over the fuel rules, adding: “Crazy!” GM said late Wednesday that the company is “continuously improving fuel economy” and is focused on “working with all parties on a solution that would involve a 50-state solution and a national electric vehicle program.” Sierra Club Executive Director Michael Brune said Trump’s tweet was completely untrue. “Trump’s rollback is unraveling from every corner,” he said. All major automakers are on record saying they oppose the administration’s “preferred option” announced in August 2018, which would freeze fuel economy requirements at 2020 levels through 2026. Trump’s tweet misstated some aspects of the administration’s proposal, expected to be finalized sometime after late September. The proposal said that by the 2030 model year, the average price increase of a new vehicle would be reduced by $1,850 and consumers would pay $490 less for financing, insurance and taxes. There is nothing in the administration’s proposed revisions that would result in engines running more smoothly. The Trump plan’s preferred alternative would hike U.S. oil consumption by about 500,000 barrels per day in the 2030s while reducing automakers’ collective regulatory costs by more than $300 billion. It would bar California from requiring automakers to sell a rising number of electric vehicles or setting state emissions rules. The administration says the increased fuel use would hike the average global temperature by 3/1000th of one degree Celsius by 2100, but would save thousands of lives over the next 30 years -- in part because consumers would more quickly buy safer, cheaper vehicles. Environmentalists and many states reject that analysis. The Obama-era rules adopted in 2012 called for a fleetwide fuel efficiency average of 46.7 miles per gallon by 2025, with average annual increases of about 5%, compared with 37 mpg by 2026 under the Trump administration’s preferred option."
2.673612427700989," Ford extends warranties on 560,000 Focus, Fiesta models WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co said on Wednesday it was extending warranties on clutch and related hardware in 560,000 Focus and Fiesta cars in the United States and Canada after reports of problems with their six-speed transmission. The company said it would reimburse any repair charges to customers of 2014 through 2016 model cars, and offer other owners another chance to get a software update to fix the issue. The problems with the cars’ automatic transmission DPS6 - made to improve the vehicle’s fuel economy - include a degree of vibration when the transmission is operated at low speed, and a potential for the transmission to default to neutral. “Ford understands and regrets that many customers have been inconvenienced and frustrated by the performance of the DPS6 transmission,” said Dave Filipe, vice president of power train engineering at Ford. The company declined to reveal how much it would cost to offer the extended warranties and said the decision was independent of news reports or lawsuits related to the issue. The announcement means warranty coverage for these vehicles is the same that has been in place since July 2014 for older Focus and Fiesta cars. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) said Wednesday it “has reviewed recent complaints and other data associated with” the customer satisfaction campaigns announced by Ford intended to address reports involving shuddering and loss of power. “Based on a review of this information, and other information including severity and frequency, NHTSA has not found evidence of an unreasonable risk to safety,” the agency said adding it “will continue to monitor complaints and other data, maintain communication with Ford, and take action as necessary.” In 2017, Ford settled a class-action lawsuit over the transmissions and agreed to pay owners of 2011-2016 Ford Fiesta or 2012-2016 Ford Focus vehicles up to $2,325 to compensate them for prior repair costs and other provisions. That settlement is pending until a federal appeals court decides whether to uphold it."

-3.2982307926559753," GM, Ford planning for possible economic downturn: executives (Reuters) - The top two U.S. automakers are preparing for a possible economic downturn, the companies said on Tuesday, as an ongoing trade war between Washington and Beijing fuels fears of a global recession. Tit-for-tat tariffs have increased raw material costs for the global auto industry, which is already dealing with weak demand in both China and the United States. Ford Motor Co F.N has a cash buffer of $20 billion for a potential downturn event, Ford North American Chief Financial Officer Matt Fields said at a J.P. Morgan Conference in New York. General Motors GM.N has $18 billion in cash, with the potential to pay two years worth of dividends, the company's finance head, Dhivya Suryadevara, said at the conference. GM has modeled both moderate and severe downturn scenarios similar to 2008-2009 to get a sense of how it might affect profitability and cash flow at the No.1 U.S. car manufacturer, Suryadevara said. “It’s something that we continually keep watching and updating to make sure that we’re all set for when the downturn does come,” Suryadevara said, adding that company does not see an imminent downturn. Deferring non-essential capital expenditure and considering a shift to lower-priced vehicles are among the few things GM will look at as part of its “downturn planning” to save costs. Ford said it was “proactively” evaluating its future moves, as it works with economists to model the severity of a possible recession. Fear of a recession has dominated trading on Wall Street this year and spurred a bout of extreme volatility following President Donald Trump’s announcement of a new round of tariffs on Aug. 1."

-7.289663157430347," Ford results dented by restructuring, gives weaker-than-expected forecast DEARBORN, Mich. (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co F.N on Wednesday reported a lower-than-expected profit, weighed down by charges to restructure its units in Europe and South America, and the automaker gave a full-year earnings forecast that fell short of analysts' expectations. Ford shares fell as much as 7 percent in after-hours trading. Virtually all of Ford's second-quarter pre-tax profit came from North America - its most lucrative market - where highly-profitable pickup trucks drive margins for the Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker and its Detroit rivals, General Motors Co GM.N and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV FCHA.MIFCAU.N. The automaker also posted a small profit in Europe and a far smaller loss in China compared with the second quarter of 2018 as better pricing and new luxury models helped offset a poor performance in that market. Ford’s second-quarter sales in China slid 21.7% in the second quarter after a first-quarter drop of 35.8%. In April, Ford said it planned to launch more than 30 new models over the next three years to overhaul its vehicle lineup in China. The automaker’s ongoing restructuring includes cutting costs and overhauling its product lineup in key global markets like China and Europe. The company said Wednesday it had so far only recorded $2.2 billion of the projected $11 billion in charges it previously said it would take for the global restructuring. Last month, Ford said it would cut 12,000 jobs, close five plants and cut shifts at other factories in Europe by the end of 2020 in an effort to return that region to profitability. In May, the company said it would eliminate about 10% of its global salaried workforce, cutting about 7,000 jobs by the end of August. Earlier this month, Ford and Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE said they will spend billions of dollars to jointly develop electric and self-driving vehicles, deepening a global alliance to slash development and manufacturing costs. The size and timing of the payoff from that alliance remain unclear. Ford had previously not provided an earnings forecast for this year. The company said on Wednesday it now expects full-year earnings between $1.20 and $1.35 per share. Analysts have estimated the automaker will earn $1.39 per share this year, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Speaking to reporters, Chief Financial Officer Tim Stone said the company now expects adjusted 2019 pre-tax profit of up to $7.5 billion, compared with $7 billion in 2018. “We have a long way to go ... to execute on our redesign,” Stone said. “We have a lot of work to do.” For the first half of the year, Ford reported a pre-tax profit of $4.1 billion, meaning that the automaker will, at best, deliver a weaker pre-tax profit of $3.4 billion for the second half of 2019. The No. 2 U.S. automaker posted a second-quarter net profit of $148 million, or 4 cents per share, down from $1.1 billion, or 27 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time charges, the company earned 28 cents per share. Analysts had expected Ford to earn 31 cents a share. Excluding a write-down of its stake in a software company, Ford said it would have earned 32 cents per share. Revenue was flat at $38.9 billion, above the $35.07 billion expected."
