47.72540115798181," Turquoise Hill gets interim relief in funding spat with Rio for Mongolia mine (Reuters) - Canada’s Turquoise Hill said on Thursday it has received temporary relief in the arbitration proceedings against Rio Tinto, related to the proposed funding of the Oyu Tolgoi mine. As a result of the order, Rio Tinto may not use the parties’ existing contractual arrangements to restrict Turquoise Hill from engaging on funding and other matters with its fellow stakeholders in the mine, the Canadian miner said. Oyu Tolgoi is one of the world’s largest-known copper and gold deposits, located in the South Gobi region of Mongolia. The Mongolian government holds a 34% stake in the project with Rio’s majority-owned Turquoise Hill owning the rest. Until further order, Rio Tinto may also not authorize re-profiling negotiations with project lenders in a manner that would render Oyu Tolgoi LLC unable to execute an offering of bonds in 2021, Turquoise added. Tensions between mine operator Rio and Turquoise Hill’s management and minority shareholders have spilled into the open in recent months. Rio owns 51% of Turquoise, which in turn owns 66% of the mine. Turquoise Hill in November launched arbitration proceedings against Rio, saying the miner’s approach to funding the expansion is “incompatible” with its own. It had in January sought an interim order in its arbitration."
64.41605839416057," Turquoise Hill seeks interim order in funding spat with Rio for Mongolia mine (Reuters) - Canada’s Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd said on Thursday it has sought an interim order in its arbitration against Rio Tinto, saying the majority shareholder’s actions limit Turquoise’s funding options for the Oyu Tolgoi project.

56.15384615384615," UPDATE 2-Mongolia considers terminating Oyu Tolgoi copper mine expansion as costs jump -developer (Adds shares, comment from Rio, analysts) Jan 11 (Reuters) - Rio Tinto-controlled Turquoise Hill Resources said on Monday that Mongolia’s government is considering terminating the companies’ underground expansion of their Oyu Tolgoi copper mine project due to rising development costs. Shares of Turquoise Hill fell as much as 20% in early trading on the news. Oyu Tolgoi is one of the world’s largest-known copper and gold deposits. Rio Tinto announced in 2019 a 30-month delay to a project to expand the mine underground and a cost overrun due to difficult geology. Last month the company confirmed that the expansion at the mine would cost $6.75 billion, about $1.4 billion higher than its estimate in 2016. The government has told Rio Tinto it is dissatisfied with the miner’s plans and is concerned that the significant increase in the development costs of the Oyu Tolgoi project has eroded the economic benefits that the country had hoped to get, Turquoise Hill said. “The government of Mongolia has indicated that if the Oyu Tolgoi project is not economically beneficial to the country, it would be necessary to review and evaluate whether it can proceed,” Turquoise Hill said in a statement. The government’s position is not surprising given it is not expected to receive any cash flows beyond taxes and mining royalties from its ownership stake in the project for the foreseeable future due to $7 billion in partner loans accumulated during construction, Bank of Nova Scotia analyst Orest Wowkodaw said. The Mongolian government holds a 34% stake in the mine and Turquoise Hill owns 66%. Exchanging the government’s stake for “a markedly higher royalty (cash flowing immediately) would be in the best interest of all stakeholders,” Wowkodaw said. Turquoise Hill said it was committed to engaging immediately with the government and Rio Tinto to address the development plan and revisit the sharing of economic benefits. The companies have sunk $11 billion into the mine since 2010, Rio said in a separate statement to Reuters, adding it “remains open” to increasing benefits to all shareholders."

26.260353649360418," Canada's Turquoise Hill considers gold streaming, debt funding for Mongolian mine (Reuters) - Canadian miner Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd said on Tuesday it intended to pursue “gold streaming” and medium-term debt offering transactions for its Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold project in Mongolia. The streaming transaction would involve “a significant up-front payment” to Oyu Tolgoi, as well as deferred payments based on gold “spot” prices, Turquoise Hill said. Streaming is a type of alternative finance that generally involves an upfront payment by the streamer to a miner, which repays the loan by supplying metal at a later date. The potential transaction will be in exchange for deliveries to one or more streamers of an agreed portion of gold produced from the Oyut deposit, the company added. It was also considering one or more offering of global medium-term debt by Oyu Tolgoi with a tenor of at least 10 years. It would require Oyu Tolgoi to make a “bullet” repayment of the principal at maturity. “We will now focus on finalising terms for a streaming transaction as soon as possible, and on completing preparations necessary for a potential inaugural offering of (global medium term notes/bonds) later in 2021,” Chief Financial Officer Luke Colton said. The Oyu Tolgoi deposit in south Mongolia is jointly owned by Rio Tinto-controlled Turquoise Hill and the Mongolian state."
26.441881100266194," Explainer: What's behind a feud at Rio Tinto's copper mine in Mongolia TORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian mining company Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd is locked in a feud with its largest shareholder, Rio Tinto Plc, over the underground expansion of its massive Oyu Tolgoi copper mine in Mongolia. Tensions between mine operator Rio and Turquoise Hill’s management and minority shareholders have spilled into the open in recent months. Rio owns 51% of Turquoise Hill, which in turn owns 66% of the mine. Here is an explanation of the dispute. Oyu Tolgoi is one of the world’s largest-known copper and gold deposits, located in the South Gobi region of Mongolia. The Mongolian government holds a 34% stake in the project with Rio’s majority-owned Turquoise Hill owning the rest. Open-pit mining began in 2011. First production from the underground expansion is slated for 2022, climbing to 500,000 tonnes of copper per year at full capacity in what would make it the world’s third-largest copper mine. Rio in 2019 announced a 30-month delay and a cost overrun of up to $1.9 billion due to difficult geology, putting total expenditures in a range of $6.5 billion to $7.2 billion. Costs for a coal-fired power plant to supply power to the mine would come on top of that figure. Turquoise Hill in November launched arbitration proceedings against Rio, saying the miner’s approach to funding the expansion is “incompatible” with its own. Rio in September said it would borrow $500 million to develop the mine, with any remaining funding gap met by a Turquoise Hill stock offering. Turquoise Hill shareholders fear that would allow Rio to take a greater stake in Turquoise Hill that underplayed its full valuation. Pentwater Capital, which holds a 9.23% stake in Turquoise Hill, and Sailingstone Capital Partners, which holds 3%, accuse Rio of mismanaging costs and unfairly restricting Turquoise Hill’s ability to obtain financing to pay for those costs. The Canadian mining company wants to extend the timeline it has to repay some debt while also exploring other funding options, including a possible gold stream, to delay or avoid a stock offering. Turquoise Hill has said arbitration, which could take up to five months, would provide needed “clarity” on mine financing. It said on Dec. 1 that the board of Oyu Tolgoi had approved forming a special committee to conduct an independent review of cost overruns and delays at the mine. An outside firm of experts is to report to the special committee within six months of commencing the investigation, according to the company. Rio declined comment. Turquoise Hill has said it would need to raise $1.1 billion via bank debt, bonds or a metal stream if it and Rio extend the timeline to repay existing loans and raise new debt as planned. However, the Canadian mining company said it may need to issue at least $3 billion of additional stock, if it cannot amend its debt repayment terms or secure other financing."
55.80221997981836," Turquoise Hill says special committee to review Oyu Tolgoi cost overruns Dec 1 (Reuters) - Turquoise Hill said on Tuesday the board of Oyu Tolgoi mine in Mongolia has approved forming a special committee to conduct an independent review of cost overruns and delays related to the development of the underground copper mine. The Oyu Tolgoi deposit in south Mongolia, jointly owned by Rio Tinto-controlled Turquoise Hill and the Mongolian state has come under scrutiny over its funding plan, with Hedge Fund Odey recently raising concerns over the project finance package for the mine. (bit.ly/2JbFMEb) In a letter to the Australian exchange on Monday, an investor in the Mongolian project accused Rio of mismanaging costs, and then unfairly restricting Turquoise Hill’s ability to obtain finance to pay for those costs. Turquoise Hill last month began arbitration proceedings against its biggest shareholder Rio Tinto to seek “clarity” on financing for Oyu Tolgoi, one of Rio’s biggest growth projects. Turquoise Hill on Tuesday said each shareholder of Oyu Tolgoi, as well as Rio Tinto, is required to support the work of the committee and to contribute, on a confidential basis, “any internal or third-party report(s) in its possession relating to the cost overruns and delays.” Rio Tinto had said in September it planned to raise up to $500 million through additional lending to develop the giant copper mine. Rio and Turquoise Hill were to jointly pursue the debt reprofiling process by engaging with existing project finance lenders, and expected a reduction of up to $1.4 billion in funding requirements for Oyu Tolgoi. Rio in 2019 announced a cost overrun at the project of up to $1.9 billion due to difficult geology, saying total capital expenditure was expected to be in a range of $6.5 billion to $7.2 billion, and it expected a delay of up to 30 months at the mine’s underground extension.

55.80221997981836," Rio Tinto faces threat of legal action from investor in Mongolian project MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Rio Tinto Ltd said on Tuesday that it would not offer any comment in response to a threat of legal action from the largest minority shareholder in its Mongolian copper project Oyu Tolgoi. Rio Tinto operates what is slated to become the world’s third-largest copper mine which is jointly owned by the Mongolian government and Canada’s Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd, in which Rio owns a 50.8% stake. Activist investor Pentwater Capital Management LP holds a 9.23% stake in Turquoise Hill and is its largest minority investor. In a letter to the Australian exchange on Monday, Pentwater Chief Executive Matthew C. Halbower accused Rio of mismanaging costs, and then unfairly restricting Turquoise Hill’s ability to obtain finance to pay for those costs. Rio Tinto declined to comment. “It is unacceptable that Rio ... is preventing TRQ from seeking the financing solutions that are most optimal for TRQ shareholders,” Halbower said. “If Rio’s Board continues with this oppressive behaviour ... Pentwater is prepared to go forward with legal action against the proper parties, including, you, the Board of Directors.” Rio in 2019 announced a cost overrun at the project of up to $1.9 billion due to difficult geology, saying total capital expenditure was expected to be in a range of $6.5 billion-$7.2 billion, and it expected a delay of up to 30 months at the mine’s underground extension. In September, it said it planned to raise up to $500 million through additional lending to develop the mine. However shareholders worried that a rights issue would allow Rio Tinto to take a greater stake in Turquise Hill that underplayed its full valuation. More advantageous financing operations included streaming and bond financing, said Halbower who also noted that he stood for a board role but said that was vetoed by Rio."
53.4412955465587," UPDATE 1-Turquoise Hill says Odey's letter contains false assumptions (Adds background, detail) Nov 26 (Reuters) - Canadian miner Turquoise Hill Resources Ltd said on Thursday hedge fund Odey Asset Management’s letter to its majority owner Rio Tinto contained a number of false assumptions and misinformation about the company and its funding plan. “Odey has a clear financial motive to depress Turquoise Hill’s share price,” Turquoise Hill said. Shares of Turquoise Hill sank on Wednesday after hedge fund Odey said it did not believe the $4.4 billion project finance package related to the Oyu Tolgoi copper mine in Mongolia is accurately described as “project” finance. Odey did not immediately respond to Reuters’ request for comment. The Oyu Tolgoi deposit in south Mongolia is jointly owned by Rio-controlled Turquoise Hill and the Mongolian state and ranks as one of the world’s largest known copper and gold deposits. Earlier this month Turquoise Hill began arbitration proceedings against Rio to seek “clarity” on financing the mine, one of Rio’s biggest growth projects. Turquoise Hill said Thursday that an additional $1.1 billion would need to be sourced with further bank debt, bonds or a metal stream should it and Rio re-profile existing debt and raise an additional $500 million of debt as contemplated. The company said it would need to raise additional equity of at least $3 billion if neither the re-profiling nor additional debt or hybrid financing is completed.

28.260869565217412," Rio Tinto faces having to renegotiate terms of Mongolian copper project ULAANBAATAR (Reuters) - Rio Tinto faces renegotiating the terms of an agreement underpinning its Mongolian copper mine project, after lawmakers on Thursday approved plans to revise the deal to make it more beneficial for Mongolia. The Oyu Tolgoi mine, Mongolia’s biggest foreign investment project, has already been subject to delays and ballooning costs, leaving Mongolian lawmakers impatient for income, while Rio Tinto says it has invested billions. Rio Tinto-owned Turquoise Hill Resources has a 66% stake in the multi-billion-dollar project and the Mongolian state owns 34%, with investment terms agreed in 2015 in a deal known as the Dubai Agreement. Rio Tinto said in an email that it understood that the Mongolian parliament’s vote on Thursday to revise the deal needed to be finalised and it would provide a further update once that happened. Thursday’s vote was the culmination of a two-year process after a working group was set up to establish the benefits of the Dubai Agreement and submitted its report to parliament. “For now, the Oyu Tolgoi agreement is not benefiting Mongolian citizens,” Battumur Baagaa, a member of the Mongolian parliamentary working group, said when he first presented the report in July. “It is good to attract foreign investment but that doesn’t mean foreign investment should only benefit the foreign side.” In July, Rio Tinto announced a cost overrun of up to $1.9 billion, saying total capital expenditure was expected to be in a range of $6.5 billion-$7.2 billion, and it expected a delay of up to 30 months at the Oyu Tolgoi underground extension. The recommendations approved by parliament include replacing the 34% interest with a special royalty and bringing forward the date - currently set at 2041 - when Mongolia begins receiving dividends. The working group argued the Dubai agreement was never ratified by parliament and was not legally binding. On Monday, Mongolia’s Administrative Court ruled that former prime minister Chimed Saikhanbileg had violated the law when he signed the Dubai Agreement. A non-governmental organization named Darkhan Mongol Nogoo Negdel had asked the court to check the legality of Saikhanbileg’s approval of the agreement. Turquoise Hill, which is 51%-owned by Rio Tinto, also said it would provide a further update once the parliamentary resolution was finalised. Rio’s difficulties in Mongolia have held back its share price, analysts say. Rio shares fell 1.2% on Thursday. They have gained around 11% this year, but Turquoise Hill shares have shed around 74% this year."
-27.58620689655172," UPDATE 1-Rio Tinto-controlled Turquoise Hill swings to loss on Mongolia mine woes (Adds share price performance in sixth paragraph, details throughout) TORONTO, July 31 (Reuters) - Rio Tinto-controlled Turquoise Hill Resources said an impairment charge at the cash-generating unit of its Oyu Tolgoi copper mine in Mongolia led to the company missing estimates for second-quarter profit on Wednesday. Turquoise Hill, which owns 66% of the mine, reported a loss of $736.7 million, or 22 cents a share, in the three months ended June 30, compared with a profit of $204 million, or 9 cents, a year earlier. That compared with analyst expectations for earnings of 3 cents a share. Oyu Tolgoi, operated by Rio Tinto PLC and expected to become one of the mining company’s most lucrative properties, produced 39,156 tonnes of copper and 71,825 ounces of gold during the quarter. That came at an all-in sustaining cost of $1.54 per pound of copper produced, compared with $2.42 a year earlier. Oyu Tolgoi’s underground expansion has been beset by delays, cost overruns and political squabbles, prompting the government of Mongolia, which owns 34% of the mine, to set a vote for August to cancel parts of an investment agreement with Rio Tinto. This would reduce the company’s future profits while benefiting Mongolia. Turquoise Hill shares have slumped 46% since it said this month it could spend as much as $1.9 billion more than the $5.3 billion previously announced on the underground expansion of Oyu Tolgoi, and that first production would be delayed by up to 30 months. The impairment causing its quarterly loss was related to that increase in expected spending and delays, the company said on Wednesday. Turquoise Hill, which is also listed on the New York Stock Exchange, said its share price decline to below $1 meant it is no longer in compliance with the exchange’s listing rules, and that it intends to “pursue measures to cure the share price non-compliance.” Turquoise Hill spent $292 million on the expansion during the quarter, bringing total expenditure on the underground project since January 1, 2016, to $2.9 billion. Turquoise Hill posted revenue of $382.7 million, down from $341.7 million a year ago and compared with analysts’ expectations of $307.5 million.

While all seven directors were re-elected to the board, according to a Turquoise Hill filing, over 40% of Turquoise Hill’s minority shareholders, including its second-biggest investor, Sailingstone Capital Partners, voted against the four independent directors. Sailingstone last month flagged its vote in an open letter, citing governance issues and the board’s lack of engagement with minority investors. Turquoise Hill owns 66% of the Oyu Tolgoi copper mine in Mongolia, which is operated by Rio Tinto and expected to become one of the mining giant’s most lucrative properties. But it has been plagued by political challenges, corruption investigations and construction delays. Sailingstone has been engaged in a tussle with Turquoise Hill for years to improve corporate governance and alluded to the ""woeful performance"" of the company's stock in its April letter here. The San Francisco-based investment advisory firm, which owns 10.9% of Turquoise Hill, also blames mismanagement by Rio Tinto for delays to the completion of the main shaft at Oyu Tolgoi, which has led to delays to the start of production from its underground mine. Turquoise Hill shares have lost 58 percent over the past five years, compared with a 9 percent decline in the S&P/TSX Global Mining index. The shares fell 0.8% to C$1.77 on Tuesday afternoon, versus the benchmark’s 0.9% gain. While Turquoise Hill’s four independent directors won re-election with between 75% and 76% of total votes on Tuesday, between 40% and 48% of minority shareholder votes were not in their favor."
