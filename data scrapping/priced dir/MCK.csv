6.672482201208374," Drug distributor McKesson raises 2021 profit forecast on COVID-19 vaccine demand Feb 2 (Reuters) - McKesson Corp said on Tuesday it has distributed over 25 million doses of Moderna’s COVID-19 vaccine in January and expects its contract with U.S. government to distribute vaccines to boost its full-year earnings. Shares of the company were up 2.4% at $184, after McKesson said it was making enough ancillary kits, containing essential equipment for vaccine administration, per week to support 10 to 15 million vaccine doses. Last year, the company signed an exclusive deal with the U.S. government to ship COVID-19 vaccines. McKesson expects fiscal 2021 adjusted earnings to be in the range of $16.95 to $17.25 per share, up from its prior range of $16 to $16.50.

7.769730512753462," Congresswoman urges Biden team to involve more distributors in COVID vaccine shipments (Reuters) - A Democratic U.S. lawmaker urged the Biden administration to involve additional major healthcare distributors in the shipment of COVID-19 vaccines to speed vaccinations, according to a letter seen by Reuters. The Trump administration signed an exclusive deal with healthcare distributor McKesson Corp to ship COVID-19 vaccines for the government. That distribution system has broadly worked, but it will face new demands as vaccines from Johnson & Johnson and other companies are expected to be added. “Given the scale of vaccinations needed in response to this pandemic ... I encourage you to consider utilizing all distributors and the full infrastructure of our commercial pharmaceutical distribution network,” Representative Anna Eshoo wrote in the letter, which was dated Jan. 28 and addressed to Jeff Zients, the White House coronavirus response coordinator. Eshoo is the chair of the House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee’s Subcommittee on Health. Reuters reported on Thursday that federal officials are talking to U.S. pharmaceutical distributors about increasing the number of companies shipping coronavirus vaccines, but have not yet made a final decision. Eshoo cited a report by the Center for American Progress, a think-tank, that suggested enlisting all three of the largest U.S. healthcare distributors -- Cardinal Health Inc, McKesson Corp and AmerisourceBergen Corp -- in the COVID vaccine shipping efforts. Cardinal Health and AmerisourceBergen have made proposals to the administration to take on some distribution, Reuters reported. President Joe Biden has called the initial phase of the vaccination campaign a “dismal failure” and plans to expand and improve the program in a bid to make vaccines available to all Americans by mid-year."

10.979670579805756," Moderna COVID-19 vaccine begins rollout as U.S. races to broaden injection campaign DETROIT/LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK (Reuters) -U.S. distribution of Moderna Inc’s COVID-19 vaccine began on Saturday, with more than 3,700 sites due to start receiving and administering shots as soon as Monday, vastly widening the rollout started last week by Pfizer Inc. Amid record coronavirus infections and deaths, Moderna has already moved vaccine supplies from its manufacturing plants to warehouses operated by distributor McKesson Corp. Workers on Saturday were packing vaccines into containers and loading them on trucks, U.S. Army General Gustave Perna said during a news conference. Trucks will set out on Sunday and shipments will start reaching healthcare providers as soon as Monday, he said. Doses of vaccine must travel with security guards, including U.S. Marshals, and will be stored in locked refrigerators. U.S. plans call for at-risk groups such as elderly people in nursing homes and medical workers to receive injections first. The Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved an emergency use authorization for Moderna’s vaccine, the second COVID-19 vaccine to receive approval. Moderna said a panel of outside advisers to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention voted Saturday to recommend its vaccine for use in people aged 18 and older. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices panel voted 11-0 in favor of the vaccine. The jab developed by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech SE was authorized Dec. 11. Pharmaceutical services provider Catalent Inc’s facility in Bloomington, Indiana, is filling and packaging vials with Moderna vaccine and handing them to McKesson. The company is shipping them from its facilities including those in Louisville, Kentucky and Memphis, Tennessee, which are close to air hubs for United Parcel Service Inc and FedEx Corp. Pfizer organized its own distribution system. The U.S. government’s vaccine program, dubbed Operation Warp Speed, is in charge of logistics for Moderna’s distribution under Perna. ‘MY FAULT’ Perna apologized to U.S. governors for confusion on the vaccine’s availability after the U.S. government reduced the number of doses states would receive in the upcoming week. States including Oregon and Washington, which are ramping up to get frontline healthcare workers vaccinated as quickly as possible, said their allocation had dropped by as much as 40%. Perna said he made an error estimating the number of doses that would actually be cleared by regulators for shipment, which was fewer than the number of doses produced. A spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said 7.9 million doses of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines would be delivered nationally this week. The Moderna delivery system will have some of the same players as Pfizer’s but will differ in key ways. Transportation companies UPS and FedEx are giving priority to vaccines on planes and trucks that are moving holiday gifts and other cargo. Their drivers will handle the bulk of the last-mile Moderna vaccine deliveries. They are going directly to vaccination sites, unlike Pfizer’s which was sent to large hubs and redistributed. “We added a lot of aircraft, a lot of temporary workers. (Vaccines) are a very small fraction of total volumes,” said Wes Wheeler, a UPS executive in charge of vaccine shipments. Moderna’s vaccine is available in quantities as small as 100 doses and can be stored for 30 days in standard-temperature refrigerators, while the inoculations from Pfizer come in boxes of 975 doses, must be shipped and stored at -70 Celsius (-94 F), and can be held for only five days at standard refrigerator temperatures. Initial doses were given to health professionals. Programs by pharmacies Walgreens and CVS to distribute the Pfizer vaccine to long-term care facilities are expected to start on Monday. A CDC advisory panel on Sunday will consider which groups should get vaccinated next. Perna said the United States is on track to have enough doses of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines by the end of the year to inoculate 20 million people, as the government projected, but deliveries of those doses may continue into first week of January. Healthcare experts forecast it will take well into 2021 for a significant portion of Americans to be inoculated. Both vaccines were about 95% effective at preventing illness in clinical trials that found no serious safety issues."

7.334388986022954," Cardinal Health, AmerisourceBergen book billions in opioid settlement-related charges (Reuters) - Drug distributors AmerisourceBergen Corp and Cardinal Health Inc on Thursday reported $7.62 billion in new charges between them related to talks to resolve thousands of lawsuits alleging they helped fuel the U.S. opioid epidemic. The news came after rival McKesson Corp on Tuesday disclosed it and the other two distributors could be expected to pay up to $21 billion over 18 years under a new settlement proposal by state attorneys general. AmerisourceBergen recorded a $6.6 billion charged related to the litigation. Cardinal said it took a pre-tax charge of $1.02 billion, which was on top of a $5.63 billion charge it incurred last year following an earlier settlement proposal. The three drug distributors in October 2019 proposed paying a combined total of $18 billion to resolve the roughly 3,200 lawsuits, with drugmaker Johnson & Johnson paying another $4 billion. That proposal, part of a settlement framework negotiated with four state attorneys general, met resistance from lawyers for local governments and several states, leading to further talks. J&J said last month it would now pay $5 billion. “We take comfort from our belief that settlement funds will be used in support of initiatives to combat the opioid epidemic, to increasing rehabilitation, mental health and other important efforts,” AmerisourceBergen CEO Steven Collis told analysts. The lawsuits, largely filed by states, counties and cities, seek to hold the companies responsible for an opioid addiction epidemic that according to U.S. government data resulted in 450,000 overdose deaths from 1999 to 2018. The lawsuits accuse drugmakers of deceptively marketing opioids and distributors of ignoring red flags indicating the prescription painkillers were being diverted for improper uses. They deny wrongdoing. Paul Hanly, a lawyer for many local governments, said the plaintiffs’ executive committee that is steering the federal opioid lawsuits “fully supports” the proposed settlement."

McKesson and rivals AmerisourceBergen Corp ABC.N and Cardinal Health Inc CAH.N last year proposed paying a combined $18 billion to resolve the roughly 3,200 lawsuits, with drugmaker Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N paying another $4 billion. That proposal, part of a settlement framework negotiated with four state attorneys general, met resistance from lawyers for local governments and several states, leading to further talks. J&J on Oct. 13 said it would now contribute $5 billion. San Francisco-based McKesson in a quarterly report said under the new $21 billion settlement framework proposed by attorneys general, it would pay about $8 billion over 18 years. The proposal is subject to further negotiations, and McKesson said it “has not reached a point where settlement is probable.” “Communities are desperately in need of the relief this deal would provide,” said Laura Brewer, a spokeswoman for North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein, who is involved in the settlement talks. AmerisourceBergen and Cardinal Health declined to comment. The lawsuits, largely filed by states, counties and cities, seek to hold drug companies responsible for an opioid addiction epidemic that according to U.S. government data resulted in 450,000 overdose deaths from 1999 to 2018. The lawsuits accuse drugmakers of deceptively marketing opioids and distributors of ignoring red flags indicating the prescription painkillers were being diverted for improper uses. They deny wrongdoing. McKesson said the proposed settlement also calls for the distributors to make changes to their anti-diversion programs. OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma and generic painkiller manufacturer Mallinckrodt Plc MNK.N previously filed for bankruptcy protection in connection with their own multibillion-dollar proposals to resolve opioid lawsuits against them."

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is executing an existing contract option with McKesson to support vaccine distribution, the health department said.

Detailed planning is underway to ensure rapid distribution as soon as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration authorizes one or more vaccines, the HHS said. McKesson is the largest distributor of seasonal flu vaccines in the United States. The U.S. has no approved vaccine for the new coronavirus pandemic, and drugmakers including AstraZeneca AZN.L, Moderna Inc MRNA.O and Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N are testing their experimental vaccines under accelerated timelines."

Hundreds of lawsuits by states and cities have been filed nationally accusing drugmakers of deceptively marketing opioids and distributors such as AmerisourceBergen Corp, Cardinal Health Inc and McKesson Corp of ignoring suspicious orders.

7.0188484581586135," McKesson meets full-year profit estimates, renews partnership with CVS (Reuters) - U.S. drug distributor McKesson Corp forecast a full-year profit on Wednesday that matched analysts’ estimates, easing some fears over drug pricing pressures and costs of opioid-related litigations. The company also said it had renewed a distribution agreement with its largest client, CVS Health Inc, through 2023. “McKesson reported mixed end to its FY19, but in this environment that is likely to be enough especially as guidance met expectations,” an Evercore ISI note said. The mid-point of the company’s 2020 adjusted profit outlook of between $13.85 and $14.45 per share was a cent above the average analyst estimate, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The profit forecast assumes an estimated $150 million in costs tied to opioid-related litigations, the company said on conference call. McKesson expects sales across most of its business units to grow in 2020, including its international drug distribution business, which has been hit by lower reimbursement rates paid by the UK government. Analysts in the past have said the company’s U.S. distribution business could be hurt as growing government scrutiny over rising healthcare costs in the U.S. is expected to slow the pace of rise in branded drug prices. However, McKesson said it expected the prices of branded drugs in the United States to rise in the mid-single digit percentage range in 2020, unchanged from its expectations for last year. The company last week agreed to pay $37 million to resolve a lawsuit by the state of West Virginia alleging it helped fuel a U.S. opioid epidemic by failing to stop suspicious orders of painkillers by pharmacies in the state. Revenue rose 1.6 percent to $52.43 billion, but fell short of analysts’ estimates of $53.15 billion. On an adjusted basis, McKesson earned $3.69 per share, while analysts had expected $3.36 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Net loss attributable to the company narrowed to $796 million, or $4.17 per share, in the fourth quarter ended March 31, compared with a loss of $1.15 billion, or $5.58 per share, a year earlier.

21.175845362832458," McKesson to pay $37 million to resolve West Virginia opioid lawsuit (Reuters) - Drug distributor McKesson Corp has agreed to pay $37 million to resolve a lawsuit by the state of West Virginia seeking to hold it responsible for contributing to the opioid epidemic, the state’s attorney general said on Thursday. The settlement announced by West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey resolves one of hundreds of cases McKesson faces by states and local governments alleging it failed to identify suspicious orders by pharmacies of painkillers. The settlement was the largest that a distributor has struck with a state in the litigation. West Virginia in 2017 settled similar cases against rival distributors Cardinal Health Inc and AmerisourceBergen Corp for $20 million and $16 million, respectively. McKesson did not admit wrongdoing as part of the settlement, which resolved a lawsuit Morrisey’s office filed in Boone County Circuit Court in 2016. “McKesson is committed to working with others to end this national crisis ... and is pleased that the settlement provides funding toward initiatives intended to address the opioid epidemic,” the company said in a statement. Opioids, including prescription painkillers, heroin and fentanyl, were involved in a record 47,600 overdose deaths in 2017, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The epidemic has prompted lawsuits by state and local governments accusing drug manufacturers like Purdue Pharma of deceptively marketing opioids and distributors like McKesson of failing to detect the diversion of the drugs for illicit purposes. McKesson in January 2017 agreed to pay $150 million to resolve a federal investigation by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration into whether it failed to report suspicious orders of addictive painkillers."

6.674157269285981," McKesson cannot claw back funds owed to subsidiary in Orexigen bankruptcy - judge Bankrupt obesity-drug maker Orexigen Therapeutics can keep $6.9 million it received from drug distributor McKesson Corp even though the former owes far more than that to a McKesson subsidiary, the judge overseeing the case ruled on Tuesday. U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Kevin Gross said applying Orixigen’s accounts with San Francisco-based McKesson and its Phoenix-based subsidiary McKesson Patient Relationship Solutions against each other would amount to a “triangular setoff” barred by the bankruptcy code.

-13.18936257649099," McKesson's Change Healthcare hires IPO underwriters: sources (Reuters) - Change Healthcare LLC, a healthcare technology company majority-owned by U.S. drug wholesaler McKesson Corp MCK.N, has hired underwriters for an initial public offering that could value it at as much as $12 billion, including debt, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. The move comes after McKesson Chief Executive John Hammergren said in January that he intended to take Change Healthcare public. Hammergren added that he expected this to be a “short-term” decision, but declined to say whether it would happen in 2018 or 2019. Tapping underwriters shows that McKesson is gearing up for the IPO, which the sources said is expected to take place in the first half of 2019. Change Healthcare has hired investment banks Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N, Barclays Plc BARC.L and JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N to lead the IPO, the sources said. McKesson, Change Healthcare and JPMorgan did not respond to requests for comment, while Goldman Sachs and Barclays declined to comment. Change Healthcare provides software and analytics used by hospitals, physicians, pharmacies, healthcare providers and insurers. It generated revenue of $856 million in the three months ended June 30, according to a McKesson regulatory filing. Change Healthcare was formed in March 2017 through a merger of McKesson's technology solutions business with Change Healthcare Holdings Inc, a company owned by private equity firms Blackstone Group LP BX.N and Hellman & Friedman LLC. McKesson got a 70 percent stake in the combined company, while Blackstone and Hellman & Friedman own the remainder. McKesson valued its equity stake in Change Healthcare at $3.67 billion as of the end of June, according to a regulatory filing. Change also took on $6.1 billion in debt last year as part of the deal that created it. Some of the debt was used to fund a $1.25 billion dividend to McKesson and a $1.75 billion dividend to Blackstone and Hellman & Friedman. A Change Healthcare IPO comes amid a wave of deal activity in the sector, as increased healthcare spending, higher patient volumes and regulatory complexity drive information technology companies serving the sector to seek new offerings and gain more scale. Healthcare technology company Athenahealth Inc ATHN.O is exploring a sale after coming under pressure from activist hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. Hospital operator Tenet Healthcare Corp THC.N has said it is exploring strategic alternatives for its healthcare technology unit, Conifer."
