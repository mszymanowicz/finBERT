3.078006916177465," ValueAct partner steps down from board at Citi credit rival (Reuters) - Credit card and loyalty programs firm Alliance Data Systems Corp ADS.N said a board member representing ValueAct Capital has stepped down, removing one conflict of interest which could have prevented it gaining a board seat at Citigroup Inc C.N. Alliance, which competes with Citi in issuing credit cards for retailers, said in a regulatory filing filed late on Thursday that Kelly Barlow, a partner at ValueAct, had stepped down from its board. (bit.ly/31LDkr5) The San Francisco-based hedge fund, one of the industry’s most closely-watched activist investors, unveiled a $1.2 billion stake in Citi in May last year which made it one of the top 10 shareholders of the third-biggest U.S. bank by assets. In January this year, Citi agreed to give ValueAct more access to its books and board of directors, deepening their relationship. The agreement gave ValueAct rights that essentially come with having a board seat, but the fund and the bank said that they only expected ValueAct to propose a candidate for the board when some potential conflicts of interest had been eliminated. (The story corrects date of revealing stake to May of last year, not 2019, in third paragraph.)"
-8.158341454532557," Publicis pays $4.4 bln for Epsilon to extend digital reach PARIS, April 14 (Reuters) - Publicis will pay $4.4 billion to acquire Alliance Data’s Epsilon marketing unit, the French advertising group said on Sunday, expanding its digital business and North American footprint. The deal announcement, two weeks after Publicis confirmed talks about the purchase, bolsters efforts by the world’s third-ranked advertiser to adapt to a fast-changing market increasingly driven by online client data. “The addition of Epsilon will propel Publicis as a leader of data-driven personalised experiences at scale,” the Paris-based company said in its statement. Publicis and other traditional advertisers have been losing ground in a marketplace increasingly dominated by Facebook, Google and digital marketing specialists that track and target individual clients via their smartphones. The French group’s shares sagged after a fourth-quarter earnings miss in February and have fallen 15 percent in total over the past 12 months. The Epsilon purchase is “a very significant investment for a company of our size”, Publicis CEO Arthur Sadoun said. “But we’re convinced it’s the right move ... in a world where data is at the heart of all decisions and the mobile phone has become our main interface.” Epsilon, which brings a trove of data on some 160 million individual clients, generated revenue of $1.9 billion last year, almost entirely in the United States. The $4.4 billion cash price amounts to $3.95 billion excluding tax, or 8.2 times Epsilon’s 2018 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA), Publicis said. The French company said it would cancel a previously announced share buyback and finance the Epsilon deal with debt, adding that the acquisition would be earnings- and cash flow-accretive from next year onwards.

-18.597434611993215," French ad firm Publicis in talks to buy Alliance Data's Epsilon PARIS (Reuters) - French advertising group Publicis is in talks to buy Alliance Data System’s Epsilon marketing unit, which some media reports have valued at around $5 billion. Publicis, whose shares were down 4.4 percent by 1025 GMT, gave no details on Monday on the potential value of any deal and said there was no guarantee it would proceed with an offer. Epsilon would strengthen Publicis’ presence in the United States, where it competes with Omnicom, Interpublic and WPP. “The group’s governing bodies feel an obligation to study any possibility to strengthen its position thanks to assets that could fit the group’s strategy and bring an enhanced service to the group’s clients, while reinforcing its competitiveness for the future,” Publicis said in a statement. Publicis has made other recent takeovers, buying French data marketing company Soft Computing earlier this year and acquiring Czech firm Kindred Group last year. Credit card and loyalty programs company Alliance Data Systems reported a bearish outlook for 2019 which hit its shares."
-10.274681201754422," Alliance Data Systems explores options for Epsilon unit (Reuters) - Credit card and loyalty programs company Alliance Data Systems Corp ADS.N said on Tuesday it was exploring options for its online marketing unit, Epsilon, including a potential sale. Epsilon, which accounts for nearly 30 percent of the company’s revenue, reported slowing revenue growth in the third quarter, prompting Alliance Data to warn that the unit’s lackluster performance could weigh on its 2018 revenue. The move to seek options for Epsilon comes after Alliance Data had said in October that it was considering a significant realignment of its businesses, which included evaluating assets that could “thrive under a different steward”. The company did not disclose the financial terms of the deal but said it would use the net proceeds to repay debt and return capital to stockholders. Epsilon, which helps companies manage email marketing campaigns, was at the center of a massive data breach in 2011 that had hit a number of companies including Target Corp TGT.N and Marriott International Inc MAR.O. Alliance Data said it had retained Evercore as a financial adviser and Latham & Watkins LLP as its legal adviser to explore options for Epsilon."
