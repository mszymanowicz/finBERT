27.02554971898251," Shell to divest Kaybob assets to Canada's Crescent Point for C$900 million (Reuters) - Royal Dutch Shell said on Wednesday it would sell its Kaybob Duvernay assets in Alberta to Canada’s Crescent Point Energy Corp for C$900 million ($708.61 million), the latest divestiture in the North American country by the European oil major. Shell had earlier this month said its oil output peaked in 2019 as it undertakes its largest overhaul yet to expand renewables and low-carbon businesses under growing investor pressure to battle climate change. The Anglo-Dutch company has been selling assets in Canada, exiting the oil sands business back in 2017, as the country battled years-long transportation bottlenecks and companies shifted their focus to higher-value assets elsewhere. “Divesting these assets underpins Shell’s effort to focus the upstream portfolio to deliver cash,” said Wael Sawan, Shell’s upstream director, adding that the sale allows it to focus on core production assets like the prolific Permian Basin in Texas and New Mexico. For Crescent, the assets add production of about 30,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in what it considers a ‘low-risk’ play with key infrastructure and market access already in place, its chief executive officer, Craig Bryksa, said in a statement. Crescent expects the deal to boost its cash generation and add to its all per share financial metrics this year. Its New York-listed shares rose almost 20% after the bell. The Canadian company will pay C$700 million in cash and 50 million of its shares to acquire the Shell assets. Separately, Ovintiv Inc also announced the sale of its Duvernay assets on Wednesday to an unnamed buyer. Formerly known as Encana and once Canada’s largest company, Ovintiv last year moved its base of operations to the United States."

-77.3787119274714," Canada's Crescent Point to lower 2020 spending, expects flat production (Reuters) - Canadian oil and gas producer Crescent Point Energy Corp CPG.TOCPG.N said on Tuesday in 2020 it would spend less and keep production roughly flat amid increased pressure for better returns from investors. North American producers are forced to focus on cleaning up their balance sheets instead of spending on drilling more as the industry struggles with volatile commodity prices amid a glut of shale oil and global trade uncertainties. Alberta-based producers, such as Crescent, have also been hit by production curtailments due to a bottleneck in pipeline capacity crippling transportation and leading to record discounts on oil. Crescent said 2020 annual production was likely to be in the range of 140,000 to 144,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d). The range is unchanged from last year after incorporating about 30,000 boe/d of dispositions executed in 2019. The company also sees capital expenditure of about C$1.10 billion to C$1.20 billion in 2020, below its latest forecast range of C$1.225 to C$1.275 billion for last year. It said it will seek future opportunities to optimize its portfolio after it exited its positions in the Uinta Basin in Utah and some assets in southeast Saskatchewan for about C$912 million last year. Crescent also said it plans to renew its share buy back program in the first quarter of 2020."

0.19695617588774864," Crescent Point to raise C$912 million from asset sales to cut debt (Reuters) - Canada's Crescent Point Energy Corp CPG.TO said on Tuesday it would exit Uinta Basin in Utah and sell parts of its assets in southeast Saskatchewan for about C$912 million ($687.01 million) as it looks to cut debt under a new management. The Uinta Basin asset, expected to produce about 20,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in 2020, was sold to a private operator for about C$700 million in cash, the company said without naming the buyer. Investors have been pressing oil and gas explorers to boost cash reserves and invest more in share buybacks instead of aggressive expansion as oil prices remain volatile amid escalating global trade tensions. Crescent expects the deal to help reduce its net debt to about C$2.75 billion at the end of 2019 from C$4.40 billion in 2018. The asset sales will add to its debt-adjusted funds flow per share by about 11%, Crescent said, adding that it will buy back another C$100 million worth of shares by year end. The oil and gas producer said it would sell more assets, including the remaining portion of its southeast Saskatchewan conventional assets. “This should all resonate with investors in today’s environment, with the potential for additional asset sales bringing the company’s leverage position much closer to what investors are looking for in E&P companies today,” Raymond James analysts wrote in a note. Shares of the Calgary, Alberta-based company rose 4.1% to C$4.37 per share. Including Tuesday’s sale, the company said it has sold more than C$1.3 billion in assets since the new management took over in 2018. The company said it now expects 2019 annual average production of between 160,000 boepd to 164,000 boepd, slightly below its earlier forecast of 168,000 boepd to 172,000 boepd."

Final results are expected to be announced on or before Friday, when the company is holding its annual general meeting of shareholders. The proxy fight for Crescent Point is the biggest in the Canadian energy sector in at least about four years. The outcome is being closely watched by energy investors, nursing losses after an historic slide in oil prices beginning in 2014 weighed on energy stocks. Calgary, Alberta-based Crescent Point, whose stock has underperformed the broader market in recent years, is under pressure from Cation Capital to change its board. With ISS supporting some of the activist’s nominees and Glass Lewis supporting the company’s choices, investors expect a close vote. The deadline for voting was 10 a.m. MDT (1600 GMT) on Wednesday. A Crescent Point spokeswoman, Andree Morier, said the company has not received the final results but is pleased with the shareholder support for its refreshed board. Cation Capital spokesperson Dan Gagnier said “there was a large amount of share movement leading up to the deadline. The vote is too close to call and any representation otherwise is false.” Alberta-based Cation Capital is an investment firm founded by Sandy Edmonstone, a former deputy head of global oil and gas at Macquarie Capital. Activism in the Canadian oil and gas sector started to pick up just before the oil price slide began. A number of activist investors were burnt by the sector downturn and have been reluctant to venture back in an environment of increasing volatility. However, with crude oil prices rebounding in recent months, activists are taking another look at the space. Cation, which owns a 0.3 percent stake in Crescent Point, began its public push for change at the company last month. ISS in April recommended that shareholders vote for Cation board candidates Dallas Howe and Herbert Pinder.
