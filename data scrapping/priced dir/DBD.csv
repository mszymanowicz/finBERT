-17.391304347826082," Diebold Nixdorf hires financial advisers for potential sale: CNBC (Reuters) - ATM machine maker Diebold Nixdorf Inc DBD.N had hired Credit Suisse and Evercore last week to look for potential buyers as it plans to sell itself, CNBC reported on Monday, citing people familiar with the matter. The talks with the potential buyers were not advanced, CNBC reported cnb.cx/2P6stmr. Diebold declined to comment. Earlier on Monday, Diebold said it was in “constructive and productive” talks with its lenders for future financial flexibility and expects to reach a resolution near-term. Given the tight liquidity position, Diebold is focusing on private-equity firms and peer NCR Corp NCR.N as potential candidates, the report said, adding that Bain Capital may be interested. Earlier on Monday, the company said it would use cash on hand and its revolving credit line to pay $160 million to the holders of Wincor Nixdorf’s shares. Diebold acquired Wincor Nixdorf in 2016 for $1.9 billion, but not all of Wincor’s shareholders had tendered the offer, CNBC said. As of July end, the company held about 77 percent of Wincor Nixdorf. Earlier this month, 13 percent of Wincor Nixdorf’s outstanding holders requested redemptions for shares worth about $255 million. Diebold said it will pay the remaining $95 million later this week. Earlier this month, Diebold cut its full-year adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) forecast. The company’s shares were trading up 14 percent."
