8.348782890552343," Retailers RH, Oxford Industries plan price hike to soften China tariff impact (Reuters) - Home furnishing retailer RH and apparel retailer Oxford Industries Inc revealed major steps, including shifting production out of China and raising prices, to cushion the impact of the tariff hike on Chinese goods. Shares of RH surged about 25%, while those of Oxford Industries rose 9% after both companies reported strong quarterly results. RH said it selectively increased prices of its products while moving certain production and development of new products out of China and expanding manufacturing facilities in the United States to offset the impact of tariffs. “Long term, we do not believe the current trade climate will impair our ability to achieve our stated financial goals,” RH Chief Executive Officer Gary Friedman said in a statement. Tommy Bahama-owner Oxford Industries, which reaffirmed its full-year outlook, said it plans to hike prices selectively, if proposed tariff hike on remaining Chinese imports are introduced. Oxford Industries is also negotiating on price reductions with factories and shifting production out of China, besides accelerating the delivery of its Fall products. Ever since the U.S. imposed tariffs on Chinese imports in the wake of trade dispute between Washington and Beijing last year, retailers have been adopting various strategies to mitigate the impact. Retailers like Walmart Inc and Best Buy Co Inc had warned of higher prices after Washington dramatically escalated the trade war last month with threats of new tariffs on another $300 billion worth of U.S. imports from China after hiking levies on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. Separately, mattress fabrics maker Culp Inc said on Wednesday the tariffs had caused “significant disruptions” throughout the furniture industry supply chain. Culp also noted that the expectation of additional tariffs led to advance customer purchases in its upholstery segment in previous quarters, resulting in higher inventories that partly hit its sales in the fourth quarter. Culp said it was taking steps to adjust its supply chain, including partnering with sources for cut and sew kits in Vietnam, in response to the latest round of tariffs."
-7.010652472236481," Blackstone concedes defeat to Canada's Oxford in battle for Australia's Investa SYDNEY (Reuters) - Private equity giant Blackstone Group BX.N has quit a takeover battle for Australian office-block owner Investa Office Fund IOF.AX after it was gazumped by Canadian landlord Oxford Properties Group's A$3.35 billion ($2.4 billion) bid. Blackstone told Investa it would not match the offer, Investa said on Thursday, all but handing the sought-after target to Oxford as office rents boom, especially in Sydney where Investa’s 20 towers are concentrated. With Investa’s board now recommending the Oxford buyout, notwithstanding a better offer, it also ends a takeover battle running since the Canadian firm emerged as 11th-hour contender last month. “There’s only the formalities to go through. I think that’s as high as it’ll go,” said Winston Sammut, managing director of property investor Folkestone Maxim Asset Management. “The question really now is what does Blackstone do given that it’s got some cash available.” A Blackstone spokeswoman declined to comment, as did a spokeswoman for Oxford Properties Group. “This is an excellent opportunity for IOF unitholders to crystallize their investment in IOF at an attractive and certain price,” IOF Fund Manager Penny Ransom said in a statement. The transaction, which requires shareholder and regulatory approvals, comes as tight supply in downtown office markets is driving a slew of deals in a sector that is defying softening home prices in Australia. British-based consultant BIS Oxford Economics, unrelated to the bidder, forecasts vacancy rates for Sydney offices to hit an all-time low of 3 percent by the end of 2019 and office rents to rise 56 percent over the next five years. “Some people think this is over, but it’s not,” Frank Gelber, economist and a director at BIS said by phone. “We reckon this cycle’s got another four to five years to run.” In other deals, Miami-based Starwood Capital has three times raised its offer for Melbourne-based landlord Australian Unity Office Fund AOF.AX to A$480.4 million. Industrial and office landlord Propertylink Group PLG.AX on Tuesday dropped its A$755 million bid for peer Centuria Industrial REIT CIP.AX while it mulls a A$732 million takeover offer from Warburg Pincus [WP.UL] controlled ESR Real Estate. Investa, which first drew interest from Blackstone in April, and a A$3.08 million bid in May, is regarded a particularly valuable because it is the largest office owner not diversified into the weaker-performing residential or industrial sectors. Before Oxford emerged as a spoiler two days before shareholders were set to vote on Blackstone’s buyout, the private equity giant had already lifted its bid once. It raised it three times before Oxford beat it out by A$48 million. Investa shares closed 0.36 percent lower, in a flat market, at A$5.55, just below the Oxford offer price of A$5.60. Oxford’s offer will be voted on by shareholders at a meeting to be scheduled in December. Investa must also pay a break fee of about A$32 million to Blackstone. ($1 = 1.4037 Australian dollars)"
-14.068364144002087," Investa to weigh $2.4 billion bid from Oxford, delays vote on Blackstone offer SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian office landlord Investa Office Fund IOF.AX said it will study a $2.4 billion takeover bid from Canada's Oxford Properties Group, an offer that was criticized by rival suitor Blackstone BX.N which also threatened to drop its own bid. Oxford had lobbed a last-minute A$3.3 billion ($2.4 billion) offer for Investa on Tuesday that was A$90 million higher than U.S. private equity firm Blackstone Group’s bid which had already won the backing of the target. Investa said on Wednesday it is adjourning a planned shareholder meeting for Thursday that was set to vote on Blackstone’s offer while it weighs the attractiveness of Oxford’s bid. Blackstone, in a letter to Investa, said the Oxford offer was “not a superior proposal” and that it reserved its rights to terminate its bid and claim a break fee if the meeting were to be adjourned and Oxford’s offer deemed better. “The alternative proposal is subject to completion of full due diligence ... (and) there is a lack of funding certainty for the transaction,” the letter, which was released to media, said. A Sydney-based spokeswoman for Oxford Properties Group, the real estate investment arm of Canadian pension fund OMERS, was not immediately available for comment. Investa has been a takeover target for years, as tight supply and strong growth lift rents in Australia, especially in Sydney where the company’s towers are concentrated. Oxford’s offer is also slightly above the book value of the 20-property portfolio, which, besides Sydney, includes towers in Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth. But, according to Blackstone, its rival lacks experience in Australia and does not have funding secured for the deal. “It is our belief that pursuing the alternative proposal will provide uncertainty to IOF unitholders,” the letter says. Investa units closed 2.3 percent higher on Wednesday at A$5.44, below Oxford's A$5.50 per unit offer but above Blackstone's A$5.3485. The broader market .AXJO was 1.0 percent lower."
