30.543089970297594," UK house prices fall for first time since May: Halifax LONDON (Reuters) - British house prices fell last month for the first time since May as a boom in activity late last year started to lose steam, mortgage lender Halifax said on Friday, echoing similar data from rival Nationwide earlier this week. Halifax, part of Lloyds Banking Group, said house prices dropped 0.3% on the month in January after holding steady in December, a weaker performance than the average 0.3% increase expected by economists in a Reuters poll. Compared with a year earlier, house prices in January were 5.4% higher, slowing from 6.0% growth in December and the smallest annual increase since August. “There are some early signs that the upturn in the housing market could be running out of steam,” Halifax managing director Russell Galley said. Halifax reported the biggest annual rise in house prices since 2016 in November, as a temporary exemption on purchase taxes for property costing up to 500,000 pounds fuelled demand at a time when other parts of the economy were still reeling from the coronavirus pandemic. This tax break expires on March 31, and Halifax said property sales agreed now were unlikely to complete soon enough to benefit. Nationwide also gave similar reasoning on Tuesday when it too reported a monthly fall in house prices, the first on its measure since June."
12.437827002357583," British bank shares bounce on reports of Xmas Eve Brexit breakthrough LONDON (Reuters) - Shares in Britain’s largest banks surged in early trading on Thursday on reports that the UK and the European Union were on the cusp of securing an eagerly-anticipated trade deal, soothing months of worry about Britain’s economic prospects in 2021. Lloyds Banking Group saw its stock climb by 5.1% by 0827 GMT, while taxpayer-backed NatWest Group jumped by 2.7%. Barclays gained 3.4%. Hopes of a Brexit breakthrough rebounded on Wednesday, after signs of compromise on intensely-guarded fishing rights and competition rules emerged after weeks of fraught talks between the estranged allies. Financial services are not part of the trade deal talks, with EU access for the City of London from January being dealt with separately by Brussels."
23.78378259911918," Lloyds bank says fraud rate for COVID loans is five times normal levels LONDON, Dec 14 (Reuters) - The rate of fraud for state-backed loans to small companies in the COVID-19 pandemic is about five times normal levels, a senior Lloyds bank executive said on Monday. Banks in Britain came under huge pressure to process billions of pounds of so-called ‘bounce back’ loans to companies struggling to stay afloat in lockdowns since March to fight the pandemic. “We have gone to great lengths to stop fraud on bounce-back loans,” David Oldfield, chief executive of Lloyds’ commercial banking arm told parliament’s Treasury Select Committee. There was evidence of fraud on 3% of loan applications, whittled down to less than 1% following further checks, still five times higher than on normal loans, Oldfield said. There was a trade off between checking for fraud and getting money into customers’ account quickly, typically the following day, Oldfield said."
26.55362896159779," Lloyds says Black employees paid nearly a fifth less than colleagues LONDON (Reuters) - Black employees at Lloyds are paid nearly a fifth less on average than their colleagues, according to an ethnicity pay gap report published by the bank on Friday. The median pay gap for Black staff was 19.7% this year, while the gap for all Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic (BAME) employees was 14.8%. Lloyds said the ethnicity pay gaps at the company reflected a lack of BAME staff employed at a senior level and not employees of different ethnicities receiving different pay for the same role. Companies globally have grappled with concerns over racial inequality this year in response to the Black Lives Matter movement, including issues such as pay and representation particularly at senior levels. Reporting on ethnicity pay gaps by companies is voluntary in the UK - unlike for gender pay gaps - and still relatively rare, although more businesses have committed to disclosing figures or have done so, such as energy giant Royal Dutch Shell. In July Lloyds set a target to increase the number of Black staff in senior roles to at least 3% from 0.6% by 2025 - in addition to an existing BAME target of 8% of senior staff by the end of this year - as part of a wider ‘Race Action Plan’. The bank said it had also launched a Black Business Advisory Committee, led by former Cabinet Office adviser Claudine Reid, which would investigate barriers to growth for Black-led businesses. Lloyds CEO António Horta-Osório said: “We want to be clear that we are an anti-racist organisation – one where all colleagues speak up, challenge, and act to take an active stance against racism. “In doing so, our colleagues will help break down the barriers preventing people from meeting their full potential.”"
6.2801885055489945," Virgin Money among challenger banks expected to join race for TSB: sources LONDON/MADRID (Reuters) - Britain’s Virgin Money and OneSavings Bank are among a group of challenger banks expected to show interest in British lender TSB ahead of an auction process which is due to start next year, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. British residential mortgage lender Kensington Group and credit card provider NewDay are also likely to join the race as their respective private equity owners are seeking ways to add scale and banking capabilities to their portfolio investments, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity as the matter is confidential. A consortium of Cinven and CVC bought NewDay in 2017 in a deal worth roughly 1 billion pounds ($1.35 billion) while Blackstone and TPG Special Situations Partners took control of Kensington in 2014 from Investec for 180 million pounds. TSB’s Spanish owner Sabadell has hired Goldman Sachs to put the business up for sale following the collapse of merger talks with BBVA. It is currently sounding out possible bidders as it wants to launch an auction process in the first quarter of 2021 and wrap up the sale by next summer, the sources said. A TSB spokesperson declined to comment on the bidders but said the lender was making progress on its growth strategy. Sabadell, Virgin Money, OneSavings Bank, Kensington and NewDay declined to comment. Britain’s mid-tier banks, also known as challenger banks as they seek to challenge the dominance of big high street lenders, are best placed to pursue a tie-up with TSB as they could extract synergies and IT efficiencies without cutting costs as much or undertaking a drastic restructuring of its branch network, the sources said. “The challengers have a much stronger case in terms of scale, integration and PR,” one of the sources said. “For any big bank there would be a significant restructuring job to do after buying TSB and no one has any desire to be all over the papers for cutting jobs in the middle of the pandemic,” he added. However, Virgin Money and OneSavings Bank recently merged with Clydesdale Bank and Charter Court respectively, and may need more time to embark on any new deal, the sources said, adding TSB’s price tag is a key element in reviewing any bid. Sabadell paid 1.7 billion pounds in 2015 to take control of TSB but its valuation has since dropped and was one of the main sticking points in negotiations with BBVA, sources have said. BBVA, which barely has a British presence, put a “zero valuation” on TSB, one source has said, but UK challenger banks may value it differently depending on the synergies, or cost efficiencies, they could extract. Most large banks including Santander and HSBC have no interest in scaling up their UK network and are expected to turn their back on TSB, the sources said. Others, including Barclays, may look at the dossier when the sale kicks off but they are not expected to go far, they said. HSBC and Barclays declined to comment while a Santander spokesperson - asked specifically about the bank’s potential interest in TSB - referred to comments made recently by the bank’s Chairman Ana Botin indicating that Santander was not interested in buying traditional banks. A successful sale of TSB would help Sabadell resume talks with BBVA or other Spanish lenders over a possible tie-up, the sources said. In the meantime, Sabadell is considering more job cuts and striking product distribution alliances with other European banks in segments such as consumer and insurance services. ($1 = 0.7419 pounds)"
7.500041812185749," Credit Suisse breaks with tradition with Lloyds chairman pick ZURICH (Reuters) - Credit Suisse for the first time has reached beyond Swiss borders and proposed outgoing Lloyds Bank Chief Executive António Horta-Osório should succeed Urs Rohner, who has spent nearly a decade as chairman. Switzerland’s second-biggest bank is seeking to move on from a year of controversy that began with an internal spying scandal that prompted the ouster of former CEO Tidjane Thiam and heightened shareholder censure of Rohner. Under new chair Horta-Osorio, whose appointment must be confirmed by shareholders on Apr. 30, the bank will face outstanding questions over the size of its investment bank and the profitability of its asset management unit. Chief Executive Thomas Gottstein in his first 10 months in the role has announced cost cuts to the investment bank and Swiss business, further consolidating a shift from risky trading to more stable wealth management initiated under predecessor Thiam. He has also flagged a strategy reboot for the bank’s ailing asset management. Impairments and legal provisions totalling nearly $900 million earmarked for the fourth quarter - one on a hedge fund equity stake, and another on a 2008 financial crisis legacy case announced on Tuesday - add to the bank’s troubles. Rohner, 61, departs Credit Suisse as expected after reaching a 12-year term limit on the board. The news of his successor takes place a day after the announcement of Horta-Osorio’s replacement at Lloyds, which he revived following a 2008 government rescue during the financial crisis. The bank returned to private ownership in 2017. During his time at Lloyds, the Portuguese-born Horta-Osorio, 56, won plaudits for championing mental health issues at companies after he was signed off work for two months in 2011 for stress-induced insomnia and exhaustion. But he was criticised by lawmakers for his high pay package and for the bank’s handling of a fraud at its HBOS Reading branch that led to six people being jailed in 2017. “I am extremely happy that we can propose a highly-proven and recognised professional of the international banking business as my successor,” outgoing Credit Suisse chairman Rohner said in a statement. During his 16 years at the bank, Rohner saw Credit Suisse weather the financial crisis better than rival UBS as general counsel and chief operating officer, and won support from analysts and shareholders in 2009 when he was appointed to the board in preparation for becoming chairman. But his tenure since 2011 as chairman has witnessed problems ranging from nearly $1 billion in trading write-downs following U.S. investment banker Brady Dougan’s exit as CEO in 2015 to an ongoing investigation by Swiss financial market supervisor FINMA over the spying affair. FINMA declined to comment on whether the new appointment would affect its proceedings. The bank, during Rohner’s time, also contended with costly tax evasion settlements after the unwinding of Swiss bank secrecy and more recent censure over shortcomings in a series of high-profile corruption cases. Shares in the bank have lost some two-thirds of their value over the period. “Horta-Osorio faces a great challenge. His priority will be regaining shaken investor confidence,” Zuecher Kantonalbank analyst José Javier Lodeiro said in a note."

17.486367249272323," Lloyds names HSBC's Charlie Nunn as chief executive LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s biggest domestic lender Lloyds Banking Group has named Charlie Nunn, currently head of wealth and personal banking at rival HSBC, as its next chief executive. Nunn will replace long-standing Lloyds boss Antonio Horta-Osorio who said in July he would step down next year after a decade at the helm. Nunn will be charged with steering Lloyds, seen as a bellwether for Britain’s economy, through the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic and an era of rock-bottom central bank interest rates. Despite taking hefty provisions against potential loan losses this year, analysts say Lloyds, like its rivals, faces further pain as government support for jobs and businesses is withdrawn next year. Shares in Lloyds, which said earlier this month it is cutting more than 1,000 jobs, are down 40% this year, although they have rallied a third since the start of November following news of breakthroughs in the race to find a vaccine against COVID-19. Lloyds shares gained 1% on Monday. Analysts welcomed the appointment but said Nunn may not take up his new job for almost a year, after Lloyds said he was subject to a six-month notice period and a further six months of restrictions. “It does mean that Lloyds will be without a CEO as they start a critical 2021 where a fundamental shift in strategy is clearly necessary to address the markedly lower revenue given the unexpectedly low interest rate environment,” analysts at KBW said in a note. Lloyds said CFO William Chalmers would become acting CEO if Horta-Osorio left the bank before Nunn joins. Nunn, a former McKinsey and Accenture consultant, who joined HSBC in 2011, was appointed to his current role earlier this year following a management reshuffle by CEO Noel Quinn. Nunn, 49, grew up near Southampton in Southern England and is married with four children. At HSBC, colleagues said he was known for his structured approach and for a focus on upgrading digital capabilities. He emerged in February as one of the winners of HSBC’s latest executive reshuffle, taking over the bank’s newly combined wealth and personal banking divisions. “It makes sense to bring in someone with a fresh perspective, he can bring a lot more insight into what can be done differently than someone internal,” one Lloyds institutional investor told Reuters, who declined to be named. HSBC said in a separate memo that Nuno Matos, currently head of its non-ringfenced British arm, is to replace Nunn. At Lloyds, Nunn will receive a lower pay package than his predecessor. Lloyds said he had agreed to lower bonuses than the policy allowed, reducing his maximum potential pay by 20%. This would limit his pay to around 5 million pounds, compared with the 6.3 million pound limit calculated by investor advisory group ISS for Horta-Osorio. Incoming chairman Robin Budenberg has also asked for his pay package to be cut by 20%, Lloyds said. Lloyds’ pay policy for senior executives has faced long-running criticism. One third of balloted shareholders voted against the bank’s pay policy at its investor meeting in May. Nunn will receive a basic annual salary of 1.1 million pounds ($1.50 million) and a fixed share award of 1.1 million pounds, in addition to flexible benefit funding of 4% of basic salary, Lloyds said in a statement. His pension has been set at 15% of his salary. ($1 = 0.7496 pounds)"
17.486367249272323," UK business confidence at four-month low but signs of vaccine boost: Lloyds LONDON (Reuters) - Confidence among British businesses fell to its lowest level in November since July as companies faced new COVID-19 restrictions but firms turned less pessimistic after news of a breakthrough in developing a vaccine, a survey showed on Monday. Lloyds Bank’s business barometer sank by 3 points to -21 for the month as a whole, hit by nervousness about Britain’s chances of a post-Brexit trade deal as well as the pandemic measures. But responses in the second week of the survey saw confidence rise by three points to -15, coinciding with the Nov. 9 announcement by Pfizer Inc about the effectiveness of a coronavirus vaccine developed with German partner BioNTech. Lloyds’ survey of 1,200 firms was conducted between Nov. 2 and 16, covering the start of a month-long lockdown for England. A third of firms planned a pay freeze, up from 14% at the start of 2020, Lloyds said."

35.9154205700874," Britain's Lloyds steps up job cuts with more than 1,000 fresh layoffs LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's biggest domestic bank Lloyds LLOY.L said it is cutting 1070 jobs, accelerating redundancies despite a return to profit in the third quarter. “These changes reflect our ongoing plans to continue to meet our customers’ changing needs and make parts of our business simpler,” a Lloyds spokeswoman said, adding the bank was separately creating around 340 roles. Lloyds announced plans in September for 865 redundancies after temporarily stopping job losses earlier in the pandemic. Union Unite, which represents Lloyds staff, strongly criticised the latest cuts. “Unite cannot comprehend why LBG would choose to cut 1,000 staff who have given the bank such commitment and dedication during a global pandemic,” said Rob MacGregor, Unite national officer. Lloyds posted forecast-beating quarterly profits last month after cashing in on a coronavirus-driven boom in demand for mortgages. The majority of the latest roles cut are non-customer facing roles in the bank’s group transformation and retail teams, with no branch closures announced."
24.475518031603947," Home loan boom boosts Lloyds Bank profit LONDON (Reuters) - Lloyds Banking Group posted forecast-beating profits on Thursday, cashing in on a coronavirus-driven boom in demand for mortgages as it set aside a smaller sum of cash to cover loans turning sour due to the pandemic. Britain’s biggest domestic lender reported pre-tax profits of 1 billion pounds ($1.3 billion) for the third quarter, well ahead of the 588 million pounds average of analysts’ forecasts. It booked new mortgage lending of 3.5 billion pounds after receiving the biggest surge in quarterly applications since 2008 - equal to 22% of the UK market share for approvals - after a cut in property transaction taxes and pent-up demand boosted activity. In September, the number of house purchases in Britain rose by more than a fifth, taking the total number of sales close to their pre-pandemic level. “The housing market in general is much stronger than anyone would have anticipated,” Chief Executive António Horta-Osório told reporters. However, he warned the British economy was “decelerating” as local lockdowns to control the virus kicked in, adding government financial support for people and businesses had pushed back deeper economic pain and further loan defaults to next year. Like its rivals, Lloyds’ profits have been squeezed this year by provisions for expected bad debts due to the coronavirus crisis and rock-bottom interest rates. Net income for the first nine months of 2020 fell 17% to 10.8 billion pounds, with 3.4 billion pounds booked in the third quarter. But echoing HSBC and Barclays results in recent days, Lloyds’ latest 301 million pounds provision for loan defaults was back in line with pre-crisis levels and less than half the 721 million pounds forecast. The bank said full-year loan loss provisions are expected to be at the lower end of the 4.5 billion pound to 5.5 billion pound range previously given. It has set aside 4.1 billion pounds so far this year. “This is encouraging news, but once the stamp duty holiday ends and given the fragile economic recovery, there are concerns the mini housing boom could turn into a bust,” said Susannah Streeter, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. Lloyds is in the midst of a leadership shake-up just as it navigates the fallout from the pandemic, with Horta-Osório set to leave next year. Robin Budenberg will become chairman on Jan. 1, succeeding Norman Blackwell. Horta-Osório said Budenberg and Blackwell were working together on a search for a new CEO. Lloyds chief financial officer William Chalmers said the board would make a decision on paying a dividend at the end of the year, if regulators lift a ban on payouts. The robust figures saw Lloyds post a 7.4% return on tangible equity. Its shares were trading 2.5% higher at 0909 GMT. Lloyds’ net interest margin - the difference between the money it makes on lending and pays out on deposits - rose to 2.42%, up from 2.4% last quarter. Lloyds has granted around 1.2 million retail payment holidays on 69 billion pounds of lending to help ease financial pressure on customers hard hit by the pandemic. Around 73,000 borrowers are still benefiting from a first payment freeze, while around 142,000 customers have requested extended relief on 9.8 billion pounds of loans. Retail current accounts continued to increase ahead of the market in the third quarter, with group deposits up by 35 billion pounds over the first nine months of 2020, which Lloyds said would help it to lend strongly into the recovery. Its core capital ratio, a key measure of financial strength, increased to 15.2%, compared to 14.6% at the half-year. ($1 = 0.7673 pounds)"

Some banks ask staff and cashiers to store phones away to prevent leaks of sensitive customer data, although this is not formally required by regulator the Financial Conduct Authority. Under current government guidelines, users of the NHS app are advised to disable bluetooth or pause the app when away from their phones to avoid false notifications. Other companies have told staff to pause the app at work, including pharmaceuticals firm GSK, which said its other safety measures were sufficient, the Guardian newspaper reported. The BTU union, which represents staff working for Lloyds but is not recognised by the bank, said it had been contacted by dozens of staff unable to use the app, which has been downloaded by more than 14 million people. One unnamed Lloyds employee who contacted the BTU said: “I live and work in a high-risk area so I am very concerned at being told that while I’m at work I have to suspend the NHS test and trace app... This defeats the object of track and trace.” Another said they were at risk as they had to conduct face-to-face meetings and due to the “blatant transgression of the social distancing rules by many customers”. “Customers and staff have a right to know if they have come into contact with someone who’s been infected,” said Mark Brown, general secretary of the BTU. Although several European countries have launched Bluetooth-based apps to alert those at risk of catching COVID-19, there is little evidence to date that the technology has significantly curbed infections.

A NatWest spokesman said the bank encouraged staff to use the app but said they should pause it when they are not with their phone. The bank discourages - though doesn’t ban - the use of personal phones in branches and contact centres. A spokesman for Barclays said the bank had not advised staff to turn off the app. A Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said: “We want as many people to download and use the app as possible. It is important to use the NHS Covid-19 app at all times, including while at work, unless in specific scenarios which are clearly set out in our guidance.” A spokeswoman for TSB said: “We’re fully complying with all public health guidance and advising our colleagues in line with best practice.” Lloyds declined to comment. A second employee union, Accord, said rules prohibiting use of personal phones in the workplace were in place to protect employees from security risks. “If customers care about the health and well-being of the bank staff they rely on, they could help by wearing face coverings when visiting bank branches,” Accord’s General Secretary Ged Nichols said."

48.48485546576239," Britain's Lloyds Banking Group cuts 865 jobs LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's biggest domestic bank Lloyds LLOY.L is making 865 redundancies, as lenders resume cost-cutting measures while the COVID-19 pandemic hammers the industry's profits. Lloyds had temporarily stopped job losses and restructuring early in the pandemic, with the commitment running until October. Union Unite criticised the cuts, which come alongside the creation of 226 new roles. “Unite is extremely worried about the future prospects of the 860 staff being told that they will lose their jobs during these very challenging times,” said Unite national officer Rob MacGregor. Lloyds confirmed the cuts and said the majority of the roles were non-customer facing and came from simplifying its business. “These changes primarily reflect our existing plans to simplify parts of our businesses, which were in place prior to Covid-19,” a Lloyds spokeswoman said. “Any colleague impacted by today’s announcement will not leave the Group until November at the earliest.”"

Global sentiment took a hit as a 32.9% plunge in U.S. second quarter economic growth, albeit lesser than expected, and a tweet from U.S. President Donald Trump about possibly delaying November elections unnerved markets. “There’s already heightened uncertainty around the election ... and the potential for a fiscal policy regime change. This just adds to that uncertainty,” said Phil Orlando, chief equity market strategist, at Federated Hermes in New York. The blue-chip FTSE 100 ended 2.3% lower on broad-based losses, with Lloyds Banking Group sliding 7.6% to an eight-year low after swinging to a rare pre-tax loss in the first half of 2020. Standard Chartered tumbled 6.2% as the lender posted a 33% slump in first-half profit after a six-fold jump in credit impairment charges. The mid-cap FTSE 250 slipped 1.3%, led by a 12% fall for car dealer Inchcape as impairment charges pushed it to losses. The export-laden FTSE 100 is on track to record monthly declines in July after rallying since April as faltering economic data and surging COVID-19 cases have dented optimism over a swift post-pandemic economic recovery.

The hefty provision, which was 60% higher than an average of analyst estimates, came as it drastically revised its models for the worst-case scenario for Britain’s economy as it grapples with the fallout from the pandemic. The United Kingdom’s biggest domestic bank, seen as a bellwether for the wider economy, said it had adopted a gloomier outlook and estimated the impact of lockdown measures was “much larger” than previously forecast. It said Britain’s GDP could shrink by 17.2% over the year, compared with a 7.8% fall previously modelled as the worst-possible outcome at Lloyds’ first quarter results in April. Under new accounting rules known as IFRS9, banks have to disclose these best-to-worst case economic forecasts, which they weight according to probability and use to determine how much to set aside for loan losses. Lloyds’ base case for GDP decline in 2020 was unchanged at 5%. The fresh charge pushed Lloyds’ provisions for the first half to 3.8 billion pounds, resulting in a pretax loss of 602 million pounds. Lloyds shares fell as much as 9% to their lowest level in over eight years and were last down 8% at 0845 GMT, compared with a more than 1% fall in the FTSE 100 index. “These are hardly ideal conditions for Lloyds, in fact they’re pretty close to the perfect storm,” said Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. “While we don’t think the bank will be rushing to restart dividend payments, even when they do begin they may not be at the level investors had previously expected.” Lloyds said it had lent more than 9 billion pounds to businesses through various government-backed relief schemes and granted more than 1.1 million payment holidays to consumers hit by the pandemic, but its support of these customers “will have a cost to the group”. Major banks across Europe have been counting the cost of likely bad loans due to the pandemic this week, with Spain’s BBVA also setting aside extra provisions on Thursday. Lloyds’ domestic rival Barclays booked a higher than expected 1.6 billion pound provision on Wednesday, while a big charge at Spain’s Santander dragged it to a record quarterly loss. Lloyds’ loss compared with pretax profits of 2.9 billion pounds last year. The bank posted a statutory post-tax profit of 19 million pounds, largely due to tax credits earned on some of its most valuable assets. Its net interest margin - a key measure of lending profitability - sunk by 20 basis points to 2.59% in the three months to end-June, as interest rates hover just above zero and demand for loans and mortgages wilts. Income for the half-year fell by 16% to 7.4 billion pounds in line with expectations. The lender is searching for a new CEO to help steer it through the economic fallout from the pandemic, after António Horta-Osório said earlier this month he would step down by next year after a decade leading the bank. Horta-Osório told reporters he had no current plans for what he would do after leaving Lloyds and would present the bank’s plans for next year in February. He said the bank’s next strategic review would require the input of incoming chairman Robin Budenberg and whoever replaced him as CEO, and would likely be announced later in 2021."

The blue-chip FTSE 100 was down 0.4%, with Lloyds Banking Group sliding 5.9% after swinging to a rare pretax loss in the first half of 2020 due to higher-than-expected loan loss provisions.

-8.783775916871505," Lloyds Bank sets target to increase number of senior Black staff LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's biggest domestic bank Lloyds LLOY.L has set a target to increase the number of Black staff in senior roles to at least 3% by 2025 from just 0.6% now. The bank said on Friday it was introducing a ‘Race Action Plan’ after listening to Black employees across the business following Black Lives Matter protests. The bank said it would publish an ethnicity pay gap report later this year and was setting up a new advisory board made up of Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic staff to inform its diversity strategy. Lloyds said it would also work with external experts to develop a race education programme. Antonio Horta-Osorio, the outgoing CEO of Lloyds, said: “The commitments we are making will not fix the issues overnight, and targets and measures will only take us so far, but we have to challenge ourselves to do better and I am fully committed that we will do so.” The plan was first reported by the Guardian newspaper."
-8.6092675221874," Lloyds Bank boss Horta-Osório to step down after a decade at the helm (Reuters) - Lloyds Bank LLOY.L Chief Executive António Horta-Osório said on Monday he would step down next year after a decade at the helm, leaving Britain's biggest domestic bank to find a successor to steer it through the coronavirus fallout. While his departure had been expected, it comes at a critical time as banks brace for a wave of bad debts as customers struggle in an economy heading into a deep recession. Horta-Osório’s successor will need to push Lloyds further into wealth management and online services while finding a way to increase profits in an era of almost zero interest rates, analysts said. His departure could also lead to some musical chairs at top banks with analysts speculating about both where Horta-Osório might go next and who will replace him at Lloyds. A Lloyds spokesman said a search for a successor that would include both internal and external candidates would begin imminently, adding that Horta-Osório, 56, had given the company no indication of what he planned to do next. Goodbody analyst John Cronin said Horta-Osório could take the top job at Spain's Santander SAN.MC or Unicredit CRDI.MI, especially if the Italian bank's boss Jean-Pierre Mustier were to switch to Lloyds. Alison Brittain, head of hospitality company Whitbread WTB.L and a former head of retail banking at Lloyds, is also likely to be linked to the role, as will RSA Insurance CEO Stephen Hester and former HSBC chief John Flint, Cronin said. “While (Horta-Osório) will be sorely missed, it is not surprising that he is planning to move on after what will be 10 years at the helm come 2021,” he added. JP Morgan analysts said Lloyds had a solid range of potential internal candidates including head of commercial banking David Oldfield, head of retail banking Vim Maru, and finance director William Chalmers, who joined last year. ‘MIXED EMOTIONS’ Lloyds shares have halved since Horta-Osorio took over in 2011, though they were higher for much of his tenure before slumping along with other bank stocks due to the coronavirus. The bank’s shares were up 2% on Monday following the announcement, lagging rival lenders in the FTSE 100 stock index amid a broad market rally. Horta-Osório led a turnaround at Lloyds in the aftermath of its government rescue in the 2007-09 financial crisis and the bank returned fully to private hands in 2017. During his time at Lloyds the Portuguese banker won plaudits for championing mental health issues at companies after he was signed off work for two months in 2011 for stress-induced insomnia and exhaustion. But he faced strident criticism from lawmakers over his high pay package and for the bank’s handling of a major fraud at its HBOS Reading branch that led to six people being jailed in 2017. Horta-Osório said he would leave by June next year and was going with mixed emotions. He told staff in a memo seen by Reuters that leading Lloyds had been the job of a lifetime. Lloyds said on Monday it had appointed industry veteran Robin Budenberg as chairman. He will join the board in October before taking over from Norman Blackwell early next year. Budenberg built his career in investment banking at SG Warburg and UBS. He advised the British government on its bailout of banks, including Lloyds, during the financial crisis. He later led the UK Financial Investments company managing the state’s holdings in banks following the bailouts and is currently chairman of The Crown Estate, which manages Queen Elizabeth’s property holdings."
-8.6092675221874," Breakingviews - Lloyds CEO leaves the big thinking to successor LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - The board of Lloyds Banking Group has devised a management handover that evokes its boss’s slick hair. Well-coiffed Chief Executive António Horta-Osório will leave the 23 billion pound UK bank in 2021, nine months after incoming Chairman Robin Budenberg joins. The smooth transition will reassure shareholders, and give Budenberg time to find a successor to boost fee income and test the waters on M&A. Horta-Osório’s tenure, which will have lasted for a decade by the time he departs, has been a triumph in relative, if not absolute, terms. Lloyds investors earned a return including reinvested dividends of minus 38% since March 2011. That’s abysmal, but still superior to Barclays’ minus 51% and Royal Bank of Scotland’s minus 69%. Brexit, low interest rates, compensation for mis-selling and the pandemic hurt everyone. But Horta-Osório controlled what he could: Lloyds’ costs were 49% of revenue last year, compared with the 59% average for the UK industry, according to UBS analysts. The bank’s orderly transition improves its chances of maintaining that lead. Horta-Osório is due to leave in the middle of next year. Incoming Chairman Budenberg, whose appointment was unveiled on Monday, will join the board in October and take over from Norman Blackwell at the start of 2021. That gives the former investment banker, who helped orchestrate the government’s 2008 bailout of UK banks including Lloyds, at least nine months to find a successor. Potential candidates include Chief Financial Officer William Chalmers and Alison Brittain, the CEO of Whitbread who used to run Lloyds’ retail banking arm. Whoever Budenberg chooses, their skills will have to go beyond Horta-Osório’s knack for cutting costs. The biggest challenge is finding a way to boost revenue while persistent low interest rates squeeze lending margins on core products like mortgages. The obvious solution is to put more resources behind the Scottish Widows insurance division while cranking up fee-based businesses like wealth management. Lloyds’ cost efficiency also puts it in a strong position to absorb smaller lenders like Virgin Money. However, that would require regulators to change their minds about further consolidation in the already concentrated UK banking market. Finally, the new CEO will have to figure out what retail banking should look like in an increasingly digital economy, while navigating the threat from fintechs and U.S. behemoths like Amazon.com. It’s a tall order. But Lloyds’ board has at least given the bank a good chance of finding the right person."

-16.233790168328174," Lloyds Bank fined $81 million for overcharging mortgage customers LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s biggest domestic bank Lloyds has been fined 64 million pounds ($81.2 million) by the Financial Conduct Authority for mistreating hundreds of thousands of mortgage customers in financial difficulties. Lloyds and its Bank of Scotland and The Mortgage Business units were also in the process of paying around 300 million pounds in redress to 526,000 customers, the FCA said in a statement on Thursday. The fine is the largest imposed by the watchdog for mortgage-related failures, and would have been 91.5 million pounds had Lloyds not agreed to accept the watchdog’s findings early on. The hefty penalty comes at a sensitive time for Lloyds, which along with rival banks has millions of customers struggling to make ends meet in the coronavirus pandemic, with many taking repayment holidays on mortgages. “By not sufficiently understanding their customers’ circumstances the banks risked treating unfairly more than a quarter of a million customers in mortgage arrears, over several years,” said Mark Steward, the FCA’s executive director of enforcement and market oversight. Between April 2011 and December 2015, the banks failed to help customers who were vulnerable, the FCA found, due to marital splits, the death of a spouse, loss of a job, and in one case, when a family member had gone missing. Some of the failings were identified in 2011 but were not rectified. A sample of 100 customer files from 2014-15 found unfair treatment in over a third of them. Lloyds said that all customers affected have already been contacted and reimbursed, and that customers need to take no action. “We have since taken significant steps to enhance how we support mortgage customers experiencing financial difficulty, including investing in colleague training and procedures,” Lloyds said in a statement. The watchdog warned all lenders that the hardship faced by them during the COVID-19 pandemic “only heightens the importance of firms treating customers in financial difficulty fairly and appropriately”.

Britain’s biggest domestic lender said it would not exercise its call option on the Additional Tier 1 bond - a type of contingent convertible instrument and the riskiest debt banks can issue - on June 27. The bonds will reset to a new fixed coupon until the next call date in June 2025. Lloyds said it remained strongly capitalised, but added: “As a result of the extraordinary market challenges presented by COVID-19, the group has decided it is prudent to not reduce Tier 1 resources at this time.” Banks have typically repaid such bonds at the first opportunity and issued new debt to replace them. But analysts believe many lenders will now pass up the chance, with Deutsche Bank among the first to do so in March. Lloyds said it would be “uneconomic” to refinance the paper at the current time. Yields on AT1 debt have risen since early March. AT1 bonds are designed as a protective layer to ultimately prevent the need for government bailouts in times of trouble. They are perpetual in nature but can be called, typically after five or six years. Like other major British banks, Lloyds’ first quarter profits were heavily dented by provisioning for likely bad loans due to the crisis, with the bank setting aside 1.4 billion pounds.

5.185197421028959," UPDATE 1-Lloyds investors rebel against bonus plan for top bosses (Recasts, adds results of AGM voting) LONDON, May 21 (Reuters) - Lloyds Banking Group investors rebelled against the lender’s pay policy for top bosses on Thursday, with more than a third of balloted shareholders rejecting its bonus plan. The significant opposition came after influential shareholder advisory group ISS recommended investors block Lloyds’ executive pay policy over concerns about a switch to more certain long-term bonuses. The policy passed with 64% support from votes cast. Like some other blue chip companies including BT, Lloyds is switching to a restricted share incentive scheme for top bosses. Under the proposals, CEO Antonio Horta-Osorio can earn a maximum annual overall pay package of 6.3 million pounds ($7.7 million), down from 8.3 million pounds previously, ISS calculated. But ISS questioned whether the discount was sufficient given the higher probability of receiving the bonuses. Lloyds said it would consult investors further after some had expressed reservations, including that it should be simplified, but said it would implement the new policy. The bank has previously said the discount is in line with industry standards and the bonuses are still subject to tests. Since last year’s investor meeting Lloyds has cut pension allowances for top bosses and raised contributions for all staff after stinging criticism from politicians. Horta-Osorio and other executives have waived their bonuses for this year due to the coronavirus crisis. In a statement earlier during the webcast investor meeting, Horta-Osorio said supporting customers hit financially by the coronavirus pandemic was the “right thing to do”, but this would come at a financial cost to the bank. Lloyds faced criticism for a slow start in providing emergency loans to companies left out of pocket following a near-shutdown of the UK economy since late March, but has stepped up its support in recent weeks. It has provided nearly 5 billion pounds of state-backed finance through the government’s various relief schemes, as well as one million repayment holidays for individual customers, the bank said.

Lloyds’ results would have been even worse but for a tax credit of 406 million pounds in quarter, which the bank said was due to lower profits and an uplift from deferred tax assets. The bank also warned it expects further impairments, particularly if the British economy shrinks by more than its base case of 5%. The Office for Budget Responsibility, Britain’s official forecaster, has pencilled in a 13% decline in 2020. And forecasts on various performance metrics set out in February, which included an increase in return on equity to 12-13%, were no longer valid, Lloyds said. Lloyds, which like other lenders scrapped its proposed 2019 dividend payout this month at the behest of Britain’s financial regulator, said its board will decide on any future distributions at year-end 2020. “Despite there being no income for investors in the immediate future, the bank is on an undemanding valuation and its likely ability to weather a crisis such as this provides some longer term comfort,” Richard Hunter, Head of Markets at Interactive Investor, said. Britain’s banks have faced criticism for their slow progress in supplying 330 billion pounds of state-guaranteed loans to businesses buckling under a near shutdown of Britain’s economy. Lloyds said it had provided 880,000 loan repayment holidays across all its product lines and issued 3,752 loans with an aggregated value of 500 million pounds via the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan Scheme (CBILS). But Lloyds is still lagging RBS RBS.L, HSBC HSBA.L and Barclays BARC.L, despite being Britain's biggest provider of loans to small companies. Lloyds has a 24% market share of relationships with small business borrowers, data from business insights provider RFi Group shows, while RBS, with a 14% share, has provided 1.4 billion pounds of CBILS loans. A Lloyds spokesman said the bank had a 19% share of the SME lending market. Horta-Osorio told reporters that Lloyds was stepping up its support for businesses, but said companies preferred other relief measures such as capital repayment holidays and overdraft extensions, by a ratio of 10:1. “You have to give customers what they want,” he said, adding that the launch of a scheme offering loans 100% guaranteed by the government would help plug a gap for small firms."

TSB, owned by Spain’s Sabadell, is one of the first major British banks to see senior executives forego pay in response to the pandemic and resulting economic slowdown. TSB’s move comes a week after the Bank of England requested all major UK retail banks to scrap cash bonus payments to executives and material risk takers, as part of capital conservation efforts that also included ditching dividends.

Lloyds has paid out more than 100 million pounds ($123 million) to 191 small business owners defrauded by its Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS) branch in Reading, England. Six people were jailed in connection with the case in 2017. Former judge David Foskett has been appointed to chair a panel to re-assess the claims, including direct and consequential losses resulting from the fraud, said Ross Cranston. He was author of the previous review which concluded in December that the compensation scheme had “serious shortcomings”. Foskett will be assisted by Philippa Hill of accountancy firm Grant Thornton and Andrew Hildebrand, a dispute resolution expert.

Earlier on Wednesday, the central bank said it would allow banks to tap special reserves of capital and relaunch a scheme to provide cheap funding to banks who lent to small businesses, as part of a plan to defend the UK economy against the impact of the epidemic, which has already slashed global growth forecasts. “The package of measures will further strengthen the ability of uk banks to continue to support our customers through the covid-19 crisis,” a spokeswoman for Lloyds said in a statement. The bank said all customers with mortgages which track the Bank Rate will see a reduction of 0.5% in their rates by April 1.

-21.100912312286894," UK banks step up support to coronavirus-hit customers LONDON (Reuters) - Three of Britain's biggest banks, RBS RBS.L, Lloyds LLOY.L and Barclays BARC.L, are offering repayment holidays on loans to customers affected by the coronavirus outbreak as it spreads in the country. State-backed RBS said on Tuesday that affected borrowers would be able to defer repayments on mortgages and other loans by up to three months, as part of its policy of supporting customers who suffer financial hardship from unexpected events. The bank will also waive early closure charges on fixed savings accounts and offer refunds on credit card cash advance fees so customers can access cash without penalty. NatWest, part of RBS, has already announced measures to help small firms suffering cash flow or supply chain problems due to the health crisis. RBS rivals Lloyds and Barclays also announced support packages for business customers on Tuesday. Britain’s biggest domestic lender Lloyds said it was offering relief on fees and loan repayments to some small firms hit by the virus. Lloyds said it would offer 2 billion pounds ($2.6 billion) of finance with no fees to affected small firms that have a turnover of up to 25 million pounds. The funding is part of its expected 18 billion pounds of business lending this year. Barclays said it was contacting business customers affected by coronavirus to offer them 12-month capital repayment holidays on existing loans of more than 25,000 pounds, as part of a package of measures to support companies hit by the outbreak. None of the three banks defined exactly how customers would have to be affected by the virus to receive help. There have been 321 cases and five deaths in Britain so far. Lloyds itself has been disrupted, shutting a call center in Northern Ireland that employs 1,000 people after a member of staff tested positive for the virus. Some businesses have had to shut offices and ask employees to work from home, while cross-border supply chains have also been disrupted. “The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is encouraged to see firms acting proactively to protect consumers who may be adversely impacted by the Covid-19 (coronavirus) outbreak,” an FCA spokesperson said in an email statement. Analysts at Jefferies estimate that RBS and HSBC's HSBA.L loan books are most exposed to a potential spike in bad loans resulting from the spread of coronavirus, with Lloyds and Barclays least. RBS’s move to extend support to personal customers comes as Italy’s deputy economy minister said payments on mortgages could be suspended across the country, where the most serious outbreak in Europe continues to unfold. Lloyds said its managers had spoken to more than 10,000 small and medium-sized enterprises about the outbreak, but said the damage on businesses so far had been minimal. It said any loan repayment holidays would be offered subject to individual agreements."

-44.65649401320736," Lloyds, Virgin Money cut jobs as UK bank customers shift online LONDON (Reuters) - Lloyds Banking Group LLOY.L and Virgin Money VMUK.L pressed ahead with hundreds of job cuts in the face of union opposition, as British banks try to keep up with customers moving online. Lloyds is planning to axe 780 jobs as part of ongoing cost-cutting at Britain’s biggest domestic bank, union Unite said on Wednesday. Meanwhile, Virgin Money said it would cut 500 jobs and close 52 branches, as it strips out costs after the takeover of Virgin Money by Clydesdale and Yorkshire Banking Group in 2018. Lloyds employed 63,000 people last year, while Virgin Money had 8,700 employees. British banks have shrunk since the financial crisis and have continued to cut staff in recent years in response to squeezed profit margins and growing demand for digital services. Unite said Lloyds had informed its workforce of the planned job cuts, describing the move as “deeply alarming”. A Lloyds spokeswoman said it was reducing the number of roles across its branch network but did not comment on numbers. Lloyds reported a 26% drop in annual profit last week after being hit by bad debts and billions of pounds of customer compensation. It has cut around 5,000 staff in the last two years, according to regulatory filings. “The decision by Lloyds Banking Group to cut the equivalent of 780 staff from its branches is yet more evidence of the bank’s profits over people culture,” said Scott Doyle of Unite. ‘DIFFICULT DECISIONS’ Lloyds issued guidelines last month on treating staff fairly after a rise in complaints to another union about working conditions across its dwindling retail network. “As customers are using our branches less often, we are reducing the number of roles across our branch network,” the Lloyds spokeswoman said. “This means we can shape our service according to customer behavior and local demand. Change does mean difficult decisions and we are focused on supporting our colleagues at this time.” Virgin Money said most of the latest job cuts would be at its head offices, adding it would redeploy staff where possible. The cuts follow 330 job losses announced in September and are part of Virgin Money’s overall plan to reduce its headcount by 16% following its takeover deal, which is equivalent to around 1,500 job losses in total."

-51.04166190061722," Britain's Lloyds hit by bad deeds and bad debts LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's biggest domestic lender Lloyds Banking Group LLOY.L reported a 26% drop in annual profit on Thursday, hit by increasing bad debts and billions of pounds of customer compensation. Provisions to cover payouts to customers mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI) reached nearly 2.5 billion pounds ($3.2 billion) in 2019, dragging down pretax profit to 4.4 billion pounds. Impairments on bad loans spiked to 1.3 billion pounds, up from 937 million pounds the previous year, as weakening second-hand car prices hit its motor finance business and two large company failures hit its commercial division. The plunge in profit, though in line with analyst expectations, showed Lloyds paying a toll for past misconduct while the rise in bad loans hinted at potential trouble ahead for Britain’s economy. Lloyds is viewed as a bellwether for the British economy, given that it is the country’s largest provider of home loans and one of its biggest backers of businesses. Chief Executive Antonio Horta-Osorio remained upbeat despite the profit downturn, saying the economy remains “resilient”. Though there is uncertainty over Britain’s post-Brexit trading relationships, the country now has “a clear sense of direction”, he said. Lloyds shares rose 3% in early trade, outperforming the FTSE 350 banking index .FTNMX8350, which analysts attributed to more positive than expected guidance on the bank's ability to build capital reserves. It had said it will build capital at a rate of about 1.7 to 2 percentage points, a more positive forecast than expected. The bank also announced a dividend of 3.37 pence per share, but the buyback some investors had hoped for was not forthcoming. The total payout of 2.4 billion pounds is well short of the 4 billion pound bonanza the previous year after cancellation of a planned 650 million pound share buyback once the full costs of PPI became apparent. Staff have also paid a price for the bank’s past misconduct, with the lender cutting its bonus pool by a third to 310 million pounds in recognition of the PPI mis-selling scandal and other misdeeds. Horta-Osorio and operations chief Juan Colombas asked to be excluded from the 2019 bonus scheme in recognition of the poor performance and misconduct, though they were still paid 4.7 million and 2.6 million pounds respectively. Lloyds said that other misconduct issues that hit its performance and staff bonus pool included its treatment of customers affected by fraud at its HBOS Reading branch."

The memo was sent to managers on Tuesday, union Accord said. The union did not say what the memo advised but said it was in tune with advice to members published on Jan. 20 by the union, which represents around 20,000 Lloyds employees nationwide. Examples of staff complaints included demands to work in their own time, asking junior staff to open and close branches, and long-distance commutes resulting from staff switching to new branches after their local one closed. The union memo called for managers not to impose such demands on staff, for staff to know their rights, and for them to contact the union if necessary. Lloyds declined to comment. Accord said problems had increased as Lloyds cuts back its branch network, putting pressure on branch managers and staff. “There were a sufficient number of complaints for us to issue general guidance rather than just responding to the individuals who came to us,” Ged Nichols, general secretary at Accord, told Reuters. He added he was satisfied with Lloyds’ response so far. On Wednesday Lloyds said it was planning to close a further 56 branches by October as more of its customers choose to bank online rather than over the counter. The planned closures include 31 Lloyds, 10 Halifax and 15 Bank of Scotland branded branches and would likely result in around 80 job losses, the union said, adding that many staff were likely to be redeployed. Lloyds has shut 569 branches over the past four years, according to consumer group Which? that tracks branch closures. Britain’s banks have made deep cuts to their branch networks in recent years, sparking a backlash from politicians and small business groups criticizing the cuts for harming local businesses and vulnerable customers.

The UK’s largest domestic banks both passed the Bank of England’s annual assessment of balance sheet strength but plans to double a 100 basis point capital buffer designed to protect lenders in a depressed economy could put both banks’ 2020 share buyback plans in jeopardy, analysts said. “Given we have not seen an acceleration in credit growth, we conclude this is being put in place to be, for lack of a better word, a “Brexit buffer”,” analysts at Jefferies said. The BoE said the financial system was sufficiently well capitalized to endure a “no-deal” Brexit but some economists suggested Britain’s imminent exit from the European Union could still crimp credit demand and lead to a spike in bad debts. Lloyds shares were 4.6% down at 1154 GMT while RBS shares were down 3.8%, erasing some of the gains booked since the business-friendly Conservative Party recorded its best election result in decades on Friday. The increase in the counter-cyclical buffer is seen likely to lead to a reduction in another pot of regulatory capital known as P2A by 50%. This will allow major British banks to absorb up to 23 billion pounds of losses in a downturn without cutting lending. For larger banks, the BoE said the changes would increase Tier 1 capital requirements, the key measure of balance sheet resilience, by about 0.35 percentage points to just over 14%. That rise could put in doubt the banks’ near-term goals to hand shareholders billions of pounds via special dividends and a buyback bonanza, with Lloyds’ 1.2 billion buyback target now considered a “best case”, according to KBW analysts. Shares in Barclays BARC.L were also down 3% at 1154 GMT. Like Lloyds, the BoE said Barclays would need to convert some of its AT1 capital into equity during a stressed scenario, if new accounting rules that fully take effect in 2023 were applied. Shares in HSBC HSBA.L meanwhile were 1% higher at 1154 GMT, even though the bank also needed to cut dividends, bonuses and AT1 bond coupons to clear the pass rate hurdle in a test described by the banks as more severe than the global financial crisis. “The BoE is actually strengthening the resilience of banks’ capital positions, improving their capital flexibility while maintaining minimum capital requirements at roughly current levels,” Goodbody said in a note to clients."
-51.057419761040904," RBS, Lloyds shares fall after Bank of England stress tests LONDON, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Shares in Lloyds Banking Group and Royal Bank of Scotland tumbled in early trading on Tuesday after failing to impress in the 2019 stress testing of Britain’s biggest banks. Both banks passed the Bank of England’s annual assessment of balance sheet strength but plans to double a 100 basis point capital buffer designed to protect lenders in depressed economic conditions could put both bank’s 2020 share buyback plans in jeopardy, analysts said. “Given we have not seen an acceleration in credit growth, we conclude this is being put in place to be, for lack of a better word, a “Brexit buffer” as the Bank of England has now determined that a 2% buffer is more appropriate in a “standardised risk environment,” Jefferies analyst Joseph Dickerson said. Lloyds shares were trading 4.8% down at 0841 GMT while RBS shares dropped by 3.8%, erasing some of the gains booked since the business-friendly Conservative Party recorded its best election result in decades on Friday. The increase in the countercyclical buffer is seen likely to lead to a reduction in core tier 1 capital requirements by a similar amount, allowing major British lenders to absorb up to 23 billion pounds of losses in a downturn without restricting lending. But near-term goals to deliver more than a billion pounds of shareholder rewards via a buyback bonanza must now be considered “best case”, according to analysts at KBW. Shares in Barclays were also trading down 3% at 0841 GMT.

-31.66143911761557," Britain's Lloyds criticized for mistreating victims of major fraud LONDON (Reuters) - Lloyds Banking Group LLOY.L has been heavily criticized for mishandling a compensation scheme for victims of one of Britain's biggest banking scandals in a report published on Tuesday. The fraud at Halifax Bank of Scotland’s Reading branch led to six people being jailed in 2017 for a combined 47 years. The scam involved small business customers being targeted and referred to a consultancy in return for bribes which the judge at the trial said included designer watches, sex with prostitutes and foreign holidays. The bank’s compensation scheme for victims had ‘serious shortcomings’, retired judge Ross Cranston said in a review. The bank likely failed to properly compensate some victims for financial losses arising from the fraud’s impact on their business, and showed an ‘unacceptable denial of responsibility’ for victims’ suffering, the review found. The bank, which has paid 102 million pounds ($130.87 million) in compensation to 71 businesses and 191 directors over the fraud, said it would offer all victims the option to have their cases independently reviewed. Cranston also criticized Lloyds for excluding some victims from the scheme and said the bank should assess further cases. Watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority said it would consider ‘further action’ against Lloyds over the failings, adding that they needed to be addressed quickly. “We are disappointed that, after such a long period of time, the consequences of the HBOS Reading fraud for customers have not yet been properly remediated by LBG,” the FCA added. Nikki Turner, one of the victims of the HBOS fraud and outgoing director of campaign group SME Alliance, welcomed the report but urged Lloyds to act quickly. “It is nearly three years since the guilty verdicts were handed down, and a decade and a half since many of the frauds took place. “Victims are suffering real hardship, many lost their businesses, homes and – in some cases – families. They need fair restitution now,” Turner said. Politicians and campaigners have criticized Lloyds for its handling of the fraud at HBOS, a business it bought in a state-engineered takeover in 2009. Cranston was appointed by Lloyds to assess its compensation scheme for victims, after financial services minister John Glen called for an investigation in December last year. Lloyds Chief Executive António Horta-Osório apologized to victims and said he was committed to implementing the recommendations of the report."

-14.563119535344804," Britain's TSB to cut 82 branches in strategy overhaul, up to 400 may go LONDON/MADRID (Reuters) - British bank TSB said it will shut 82 branches next year, or 15% of its network, in a turnaround plan that aims to save a total of 100 million pounds ($128 million) by 2022 and which a source said could mean the loss of up to 400 jobs. The bank, whose roots go back about 200 years, was bought by Banco Sabadell for 1.7 billion pounds in 2015 as the Spanish bank sought to expand into Britain. The move backfired when IT glitches sent TSB’s costs spiraling, forcing Chief Executive Paul Pester to resign amid complaints from customers and lawmakers over the fiasco. TSB said on Monday it was cutting the branches as more customers were banking online. New CEO Debbie Crosbie said the bank would likely close more in the future. TSB is following a blueprint set by larger rivals, such as Lloyds LLOY.L and RBS RBS.L, by reducing its branch network and plowing 120 million pounds into digital channels to fend off upstart online rivals. The bank did not give details on potential job losses from the branch closures, but a source familiar with the plans said about 300 to 400 positions would be affected by the cuts. TSB employs nearly 8,000 staff in Britain. “The decision by TSB to abandon 82 local community bank branches is absolutely deplorable and a tragedy for the banking sector,” said Dominic Hook, national officer at employee union Unite, which is campaigning to keep bank branches open. He said the decision would have a disastrous impact on local businesses and vulnerable customers. Announcing its mid-term strategy for 2019-22, TSB said it aimed to improve its cost-to-income ratio by 15 percentage points by 2022, in a bid to deliver a profit after last year’s loss. TSB said it was aiming for a profit after tax of 130 million to 140 million pounds by 2022, from a breakeven position now. Restructuring charges will amount to 180 million pounds. Since Sabadell bought TSB in 2015, the outlook has darkened amid uncertainty surrounding Britain’s planned departure from the European Union and due to low interest rates, making it tough to deliver a quick turnaround. Sabadell Chairman Josep Oliu said this year TSB needed first to cut costs before potentially becoming a candidate for a sale or taking part in any consolidation in Britain. Oliu said TSB was not expected to contribute positively to group’s earnings until 2020. TSB was hit by fresh IT problems on Friday that meant thousands of customers woke up to find wages and vital payments had not reached their accounts. The IT failure came just days after TSB was heavily criticized in a law firm report for its handling of last year’s crash, which locked nearly two million customers out of their accounts."
2.068991068882023," Lloyds profit slumps after PPI hit and bad loan surge LONDON (Reuters) - Lloyds Banking Group LLOY.L came close to suffering a shock third-quarter pretax loss on Thursday after an increase in bad loans and a fresh 1.8 billion pounds ($2.3 billion) provision for mis-sold loan insurance payouts. Pretax profit of 50 million pounds fell short of a 163 million pound average analyst forecast as Britain’s most costly consumer banking scandal continued to haunt the bank. As Britain’s biggest mortgage lender, due in part to its Halifax business, and a key source of finance for small companies, Lloyds is seen as a bellwether for the UK economy, and most exposed to shaky sentiment among business and household borrowers unsettled by Britain’s protracted exit from the EU. Underlying profit of 1.82 billion pounds also missed expectations after a 15% rise in impairments to 371 million pounds, largely due to a specific corporate failure which Lloyds declined to identify and lower used-car prices that hurt its motor finance business. Third-quarter income also disappointed, falling 6% to 4.2 billion pounds in part due to subdued commercial banking activities. But Chief Finance Officer William Chalmers said credit conditions remained benign and the bank did not see any major negative issues, based on internal warning indicators, although investment activity was lower than typical. Chalmers said he hoped the UK’s general election in December would ultimately resolve Brexit uncertainty and help settle consumer and business nerves. “I think uncertainty will hopefully come to an end over the course of the next nine months, 12 months, be it what it may, and we hope that will then encourage more long-term investment into the economy,” he told reporters on a conference call. The fresh provision for mis-sold loan insurance or PPI payouts topped a forecast of between 1.2 billion pounds and 1.8 billion, published last month, and followed a surge of last-minute applications before a claims deadline in August. That prompted the bank to suspend an eagerly-anticipated share buyback program. While committed to the bank’s ordinary dividend, Chalmers said the question of returning excess capital to investors remained a matter for the board at the end of the year. Shares fell 2.3% in early trading, before falling further down 2.6% by 0937 GMT. PPI or payment protection insurance policies were sold alongside a personal loan or mortgage to cover repayments if borrowers fell ill or lost jobs, but many were unsuitable. The deluge of PPI claims had already dented third-quarter results for rivals RBS RBS.L and Barclays BARC.L, sending the industry's final compensation bill above an estimated 50 billion pounds. Lloyds said it was cutting costs faster than expected and reduced its total costs target for the year by 100 million pounds to 7.9 billion pounds. Loans and advances to customers increased by 6.2 billion to 447.2 billion, with continued growth in the lender’s open mortgage book, small business lending and motor finance. Net interest margin, a key measure of profitability, remained in line with guidance at 2.88 percent. The bank also announced a shake-up of its leadership team, with Chairman Norman Blackwell retiring from the role at or before the bank’s 2021 annual meeting, while chief operating officer Juan Colombas will step down in July."

-1.6393202904229325," Spain's Sabadell sticks to 2019 targets on lower TSB tech costs MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's Banco Sabadell SABE.MC almost doubled its third-quarter net profit as provisions related to IT failings at its British bank TSB fell, lifting its shares close to 1% on Friday. Spanish banks have gone abroad in search of higher revenues, but Sabadell’s 2015 purchase of TSB has been marred by major technology glitches, which last year led to losses of 240 million euros at the British bank. For the first nine months of 2019 TSB lost 5 million euros, after booking a restructuring charge of 15 million euros in the third quarter. Sabadell’s chief financial officer Tomas Varela told analysts in a call that TSB could book some additional charges in the last quarter of the year. TSB will present its strategic plan on Nov. 25, which is expected to focus on costs and growing small business lending. Sabadell said its overall net profit for the quarter was 251 million euros ($279 million), compared to 127 million euros a year before and higher than the 231 million euros forecast in a Reuters poll of analysts. In the same quarter last year Sabadell had one-off costs of 88 million euros related to the TSB IT outage. Although third quarter net profit was down 8% against the previous quarter, Sabadell said it was on target to meet its return on equity target of more than 6.5% by the end of 2019 after it finished September at 6.9%. “A sound set of numbers ... that should support the stock, also in the context of management confirming most points of this year’s guidance, which should reassure consensus and provide further support to our forecasts,” UBS said in a client note. Ultra low interest rates squeezed Sabadell’s net interest income (NII), a measure of earnings on loans minus deposit costs, which fell by 2.9% in the third quarter to 906 million euros from a year earlier, but was slightly better than forecast. Like other European banks, Spanish lenders are struggling to increase earnings from lending because of ultra-loose monetary policy. Sabadell lowered its NII guidance to between 0 and -1% in 2019 in July, before the ECB cut rates deeper into negative territory in September. It had previously forecast NII growth of 1%-2% for 2019. In an attempt to offset increasing competition, Spanish banks are focused on cost-cutting and shifting to more profitable consumer and enterprise business, while also building up their capital positions. At the end of September, Sabadell increased its core tier-1 capital ratio by 21 basis points to 11.4%. Taking into account real estate asset disposals, Sabadell said its pro-forma core-tier 1 capital ratio was 11.8%, which its CFO said would be its reported target for the end of the year. Sabadell also announced a 0.02 euros gross per share dividend against 2019 results to be paid in treasury stock."

31.42856670027499," Lloyds and Barclays hit by $4 billion insurance mis-selling claims LONDON (Reuters) - Lloyds LLOY.L and Barclays BARC.L on Monday said a surge in late claims could see them pay out around $2 billion more each to settle Britain's costliest consumer banking scandal, the mis-selling of payment protection insurance (PPI). Lloyds on Monday said it will set aside up to an extra 1.8 billion pounds ($2.2 billion) to settle PPI claims, while Barclays BARC.L later said it would set aside between 1.2 billion pounds and 1.6 billion pounds. Lloyds also said it was suspending its 2019 share buyback program. The huge provisions show how banks in Britain are still battling with the legacy of the scandal, even after the Aug. 29 deadline for consumers to complain, as a rush of customer enquiries in the run-up to that date forced them to set aside more compensation money. PPI policies were sold alongside a personal loan or mortgage to cover repayments if borrowers fell ill or lost jobs, but many were unsuitable. Britain’s High Court in 2011 ruled that consumers could retroactively seek compensation for mis-sold policies. The subsequent rush of claims has been a boon for consumers, egged on by a rise in so-called claims management companies, with lenders having paid out more than 36 billion pounds in total and the final tally expected to top 50 billion pounds. RBS RBS.L said last week it faced additional costs of up to 900 million pounds, while Clydesdale Bank made a fresh 300-450 million pound provision. As Britain’s biggest domestic lender, Lloyds has been the most exposed to PPI and has already paid out more than 20 billion pounds. Lloyds said on Monday it had received 600,000-800,000 requests for information about PPI per week in August, well above its expectations of around 190,000 per week. As a result, it expects to set aside a further 1.2-1.8 billion pounds in its third quarter results to cover payouts. Lloyds also said it had received a claim submitted by the Insolvency Service’s Official Receiver on behalf of bankrupt consumers, pushing costs higher. It added the charge would dent its profitability and it scrapped guidance for a return on tangible equity of around 12% this year. It also warned the increase in its capital ratio in 2019 would be below its 170-200 basis points per annum guidance. Barclays said it still aims to hold its core capital level at its 13% target by year-end. Lloyds made PPI provisions worth 650 million pounds in the first half of this year, meaning the total combined cost for 2019 could hit as much as 2.45 billion pounds, equivalent to 41% of its 6 billion pounds pretax profit last year. The bank set aside 750 million pounds for PPI in 2018. Analysts at broker KBW said the top end of the Lloyds charge at 1.8 billion pounds was marginally better than their worst case scenario, while the Barclays provision was higher than the 700 million pounds they had predicted. Lloyds was given some breathing space on capital in May, when regulators reduced its required core capital ratio to 12.5% from 13%, equating to around 1 billion pounds. Lloyds is continuing to target paying a dividend and said it would make a decision on surplus capital at the end of the year."

Lloyds’ subsidiary Halifax will pay a purchase price of around 3.8 billion pounds, representing a 2.5% premium on the gross book value and will be funded using existing internal resources, the lender said. Britain's biggest supermarket chain Tesco plc TSCO.L said in May this year its banking unit would cease mortgage lending, citing cut-throat competition that has squeezed profits for lenders across the sector. Uncertainty over Britain’s exit from the European Union has prevented interest rate increases that could have boosted loan margins, while a glut of new banks and rules pushing established players to lend more have increased the supply of mortgages. “The sale is in line with Tesco Bank’s strategy of focusing on a reduced number of products and services that serve the broad range of Tesco customers, and will reduce operating and funding costs,” the supermarket said in a statement on Tuesday. Under the ownership of Tesco Bank, the portfolio, which comprises over 23,000 mortgage customers, generated income of around 81 million pounds and a pre-tax profit of around 9 million pounds in the year to February 28. The ownership of the portfolio is expected to transfer at end of September, with transfer of the legal title anticipated by end of March 2020. It will add to Lloyds’ already hefty mortgage portfolio and consolidate its position as the biggest mortgage lender in the UK; its lending stood at 42.5 billion pounds at the end of 2018, according to UK Finance, the trade body for UK banking and financial services."

30.41667317782298," Lloyds tackles scourge of domestic financial abuse with special support team LONDON (Reuters) - Lloyds Banking Group LLOY.L is launching a specialist economic abuse support team with powers to help liberate thousands of vulnerable customers from financial oppression at the hands of their partners. After campaigns to improve financial support for customers with cancer and mental ill health, Lloyds is look to people who suffer domestic abuse through the arbitrary control, exploitation or sabotage of household finances and debt. Britain’s biggest mortgage lender is training five staff members to provide a telephone hotline offering advice and guidance to at-risk customers, who will initially be referred to Lloyds by charity partners and victim refuges. “One in four women and one in six men will be affected by domestic abuse in their lifetimes. When you think we have 25 million customers, and around 67,000 staff, the reason for us to address this is clear,” Martin King, head of customer vulnerability at Lloyds, told Reuters. According to a report published in June by Surviving Economic Abuse, one of the bank’s charity partners, six in 10 domestic abuse survivors claim their partner had built up debt in their name, forced them to borrow money or make a purchase against their will. The team, based in Newport, South Wales, will be trained to help customers who have been coerced into taking on personal loans or pressured into signing paperwork for joint debt such as mortgages. The staff will also advise customers who are struggling financially because cards and documents necessary to access their money have been withheld by the dominant partner. In the most acute cases, they will also provide critical assistance to customers who have fled abusive homes and who need to rebuild their lives from scratch. To coincide with the launch of the telephone service, Lloyds is also changing its account terms and conditions to allow a party to be removed from a joint account where one of the account holders has been the victim of financial abuse. The team will also have the ability to open up bank accounts without any identification or using a post office box address, under special circumstances. The bank will also refer more complex financial abuse cases - typically where both parties are long-term Lloyds customers or hold a mortgage - to a specialist panel with powers to amend mortgage rates, divide and even cancel some problem debts. Lloyds is hoping to have a pilot of the economic, financial and domestic abuse hotline up and running by September."
15.453586859715607," Breakingviews - Lloyds’ PPI tragicomedy has suitably shambolic end LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Oh dear. Lloyds Banking Group is ending its misssold payment protection insurance scandal as it began – with an almighty slap in shareholders’ faces. The UK’s largest domestic-focused bank on Wednesday revised down full-year returns on tangible equity after it posted a 7% decline in first-half pre-tax profits due to a higher than expected PPI charges. Such ‘one-off’ costs should roll off after an August deadline. But it’s still a dent to CEO Antonio Horta-Osorio’s credibility. For long-suffering shareholders, the Aug. 29 deadline to claim PPI compensation cannot come soon enough. Back in 2011, the lender took a 3.2 billion pound provision charge in a now-ironic attempt to get out in front of the issue. It has since provisioned more than 20 billion pounds. The first half of 2019 didn’t deviate from this tawdry pattern: Lloyds announced a 550 million pound charge due to higher claimant volumes, roughly 10 times what analysts expected. The fact that shares fell by 4% on Wednesday reflects the fact that Horta-Osorio will still have to pay PPI claims after the deadline, as long as customers get their applications in beforehand. True, underlying performance is solid enough: the lender posted a respectable 11.5% return on tangible equity. Annual returns will now be around 12%, rather than 14% forecast. And if you take away the PPI provisions and other one-off items then Lloyds’s ROTE rises to a peer-beating 16.3%. Ordinarily, that should lead to a rally in shares trading at mere tangible book value, assuming a 10% cost of capital. But heady “underlying” returns could yet turn out to be a mirage. Firstly, Lloyds acknowledged that risks of a ‘no-deal’ Brexit “have increased” – something which would likely lead to a spike in loan losses from historically low levels. Secondly, pressure on lending margins – Lloyds’ net interest margin shrunk by 3 basis points year on year – and the prospect of the Bank of England lowering rates all add up to a new set of headwinds for Horta-Osorio to navigate. Investors will cheer the end of the miserable PPI saga, and understand the difficulty of forecasting claims. But it shows the dangers inherent in predicting anything other than a worst-case scenario."
15.453586859715607," Lloyds Bank plays down Brexit fears as mis-selling charge hits profits again LONDON (Reuters) - Lloyds Banking Group LLOY.L played down mounting concerns about Britain's Brexit crisis as it missed first-half profit forecasts due to a much larger than expected charge for mis-selling insurance. Chief Executive Antonio Horta-Osorio said Lloyds had seen business confidence deteriorate, but little impact on consumers as odds of a chaotic exit from the European Union shorten and economic surveys paint an increasingly gloomy picture. “The economy has remained resilient, that is evidenced by the very low levels of corporate debt, low levels of private debt, low unemployment and the highest employment numbers ever. So on the consumer side we don’t see any signs of distress,” Horta-Osorio said on Wednesday. Lloyds has been the only one of Britain’s four biggest lenders not to have taken a provision against a potential Brexit-related increase in bad loans, and its comments contrast with some deteriorating economic indicators. A survey from the Confederation of British Industry on Wednesday said optimism among smaller British manufacturers tumbled to a three-year low in July, while separate data from Britain’s car sector showed investment fell by more than 70% in the first half of the year. Lloyds, which has a 15 billion pound ($18 billion) motor finance business, did say weakness in used car prices led to a 27% jump in impairments to 579 million pounds over the six months to the end of June. The bank said exceptional charges, including the fresh 550 million pound provision for mis-selling payment protection insurance (PPI), would also knock its ability to build capital for 2019. The PPI provision dragged Lloyds’ pretax profits for the first half of the year down to 2.9 billion pounds, below analysts’ average forecast of 3.45 billion pounds, according to company-provided data. The lender warned there could be more PPI charges to come. “I’d love to be able to tell you that I can guarantee they’ll be no more impact, but I’ve done this for too long and done too many quarters of this. There is always uncertainty with regard to volumes,” the bank’s outgoing Chief Financial Officer George Culmer said. Lloyds shares fell 4%, the worst performance on the STOXX European banks index .SX7P. Britain’s lenders are bracing for a potential disorderly Brexit, with businesses voicing concerns at new Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s combative approach and the raised prospects of the country leaving the European Union without a deal, which has slashed the value of the pound. Culmer said the bank had made a major communications effort to warn business customers of the potential risks of a ‘no deal’ Brexit, but said the lender was resilient enough to cope with any fallout. Intense competition in Britain’s home lending market pulled down Lloyds’ net interest margin - a closely-watched measure of underlying profitability - to 2.9% from 2.91% the previous quarter and 2.93% a year ago. Despite the deterioration, both the impairments and net interest margin figures were in line with analyst expectations.

Standard Life Aberdeen will also continue to manage 35 billion pounds of assets under terms of the settlement, after winning a legal battle in May to stop Lloyds from cancelling the contract early. Lloyds had argued the 11 billion pound merger of Aberdeen Asset Management and Standard Life in 2017 gave just cause for it to cancel Aberdeen’s 2014 contract because it considered insurer Standard Life as a “material competitor”. But after a lengthy arbitration process, a tribunal ruled Lloyds - Britain’s biggest mortgage lender and parent of pensions provider Scottish Widows - was not entitled to give notice in February 2018 to terminate the deal. Under terms of the settlement, SLA will manage about one third of the 100 billion pounds of assets under management on behalf of Lloyds entities until at least April 2022, subject to applicable investment management arrangements, SLA said. The assets comprise about 30 billion pounds in passive portfolios as well as about 5 billion pounds in real estate funds. This settlement resolves all outstanding contractual differences between the two companies and they will continue their commercial relationship, SLA added.

-5.3929657493523475," UPDATE 3-Britain's Lloyds fined $58 mln for HBOS fraud failings (Adds comment from victims group) * Fine for failures at HBOS arm to disclose fraud suspicions * Lloyds acquired HBOS at height of financial crisis * Some investors have criticised Lloyds’ handling of case LONDON, June 21 (Reuters) - Britain’s financial watchdog has fined Lloyds Banking Group 45.5 million pounds ($58 million) for failures to disclose suspicions of fraud at an HBOS branch in Reading, southern England. The fine is a further embarrassment for Lloyds as banks continue to pay for misbehaviour during the financial crisis a decade ago when Britain had to bail out several lenders. Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS) was involved in one of Britain’s biggest banking frauds which led to six people, including two former HBOS bankers, being jailed in 2017 for a combined 47 years. HBOS was rescued by Lloyds in a state-engineered takeover in 2009. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) says HBOS identified suspicious conduct in Reading in early 2007 but did not tell the regulator until the year Lloyds acquired the bank. The fine would have been 65 million pounds but was discounted by 30% after Lloyds agreed to resolve the matter, angering a group representing victims of the fraud. Nikki Turner, one of the victims of the HBOS fraud who runs campaign group SME Alliance, said the fine had come too late. “For victims who lost their businesses, livelihoods and, in some cases families, because of the craven, unrestricted behaviour of HBOS bankers, action coming over a decade after the event is the ultimate insult,” Turner said. The fine is the largest imposed by the FCA on a firm for not being open and co-operative with the watchdog, but it is dwarfed by the 6 billion pound pre-tax profit made by Lloyds last year. Lloyds shares were down 0.6% at 13.50 GMT. The FCA said HBOS failed to be open and cooperative and failed to disclose information appropriately to the then regulator, the Financial Services Authority (FSA). The bank’s failures caused delays to investigations by both the FCA and police, said Mark Steward, the FCA’s executive director of enforcement and market oversight. “There is no evidence anyone properly addressed their mind to this matter or its consequences,” Steward said. The watchdog also banned Lynden Scourfield, Mark Dobson, and husband and wife David Mills and Alison Mills, who were all convicted in 2017 in a fraud trial related to the Reading case, from working in financial services. Lloyds Banking Group said in a statement it welcomed the FCA’s “comprehensive investigation”, accepted its findings and apologised to customers affected. The then FSA appointed investigators to examine the misconduct, but the probe was put on hold from 2013 to 2017 to allow for the criminal prosecution to be completed. Lloyds has not yet drawn a line under the fraud at the HBOS Reading branch, with its handling of the affair questioned at the bank’s annual meeting last month. British television personality Noel Edmonds has alleged his former entertainment business collapsed as a result of the fraud, while Lloyds has said 71 business customers have been offered compensation, of whom 98% have accepted its offers.

Veteran lawmaker Frank Field accused Britain’s best-paid bank chief Horta-Osorio of “greed” for keeping a maximum employer contribution rate to his pension of 33% at a time when rival banks are voluntarily reducing theirs to meet industry guidelines. “It is very difficult to accept the word greed, when my total fixed compensation of 2.8 million pounds is lower than the group CEO of HSBC,” Horta-Osorio said. When share awards and other payments were factored in, the Lloyds chief was the best paid among major British bank CEOs in 2018 according to company reports, taking home 6.4 million pounds compared with 4.6 million for HSBC’s John Flint. The scrutiny over the Lloyds CEO’s pay comes as other big companies in Britain are scaling back executive pension packets, in response to growing shareholder discontent over the gap between bosses’ payouts and those of ordinary workers. The new focus on the pension payouts, which are usually made in cash, came from the Investment Association, an industry body of fund managers, which in November last year updated guidelines to say bosses should receive employer pension contributions in line with other workers. The Association said it will issue warnings on companies that offer executives pension contributions in excess of 25% of salary. Lloyds has the starkest pay difference among big banks, with Horta-Osorio paid 169 times as much as the median paid employee on 37,058 pounds, the company’s 2018 annual report showed. The chair of the bank’s board remuneration committee Stuart Sinclair said that Lloyds’ pension policy would likely “converge” towards others when it next announces its policy in a year’s time. He said the bank’s staff have not voiced dissent about their CEO’s pay. “People like a winner, when I meet [our staff] who are on 22, 33 or 40,000 pounds a year they look at Antonio and see a winner...there’s a charisma around Antonio that people say ‘good luck’ to him,” Sinclair said. Field said the committee had received correspondence criticising the pension arrangements. (Reporting By Lawrence White and Iain Withers Editing by Alexandra Hudson)"

-21.777941037731104," Lloyds defends CEO pay after investor anger at annual investor meeting LONDON (Reuters) - Lloyds Banking Group has defended the 6.3 million pound ($8.06 million) pay package awarded to chief executive Antonio Horta-Osorio, after criticism from politicians and investor trade bodies. Horta-Osorio’s pay in 2018 has drawn harsh commentary, with particular focus on the generous pension perks that eclipsed those on offer to Lloyds’ broader workforce. Addressing questions at the company’s annual general meeting, Lloyds Chairman Norman Blackwell insisted executive awards were “fair” and justified given the bank’s turnaround in recent years from the brink of insolvency to becoming one of Europe’s most profitable lenders. “Let me be clear - our view is we should and need to pay for performance,” Blackwell said, adding of the bank’s senior leadership team that “not many people would do the arduous hours and arduous tasks they do for free”. But one investor accused the bank’s bosses of “living in a parallel universe” and said awards to bankers like Horta-Osorio - currently Britain’s best paid banking boss - “totally distort the world in which we are living”. Despite the concerns raised, the remuneration report was backed by 92% of investors that cast their votes. Investors also questioned the lender’s handling of a major fraud at the bank’s HBOS Reading branch, with at least two accusing Blackwell and fellow executives of lying about the scandal and calling for Blackwell to resign. In a repeat from last year’s event, British television personality Noel Edmonds posed a barrage of questions about the fraud in a heated, 10-minute exchange with the Lloyds chairman. Edmonds alleges his former entertainment business collapsed as a result of the HBOS Reading fraud and has long threatened legal action against the bank. “If you don’t know how many police forces are investigating Lloyds Bank, then you clearly don’t know the extent of the criminality in Lloyds Bank, do you?” Edmonds asked. “You and many others can make allegations all over the place but criminality has to be proven,” Blackwell responded. “There is no countenancing in this bank of any illegality or wrongdoing.” Blackwell said various inquiries into what went wrong were still ongoing and the bank would co-operate with any police investigation. A Lloyds spokesman said 71 business customers of HBOS Reading had been offered compensation and 98% had accepted those offers. Horta-Osorio has already waived part of the bank’s contributions to his pension pot this year, taking the annual payments to 33 percent of base salary from 46 percent previously. But that is still more than double the 13 percent contribution made to the retirement pots of less senior Lloyds employees. Barclays, Standard Chartered and Standard Life Aberdeen all had more sizeable investor rebellions against the pay of senior management in the past few years, although all ultimately secured a majority of shareholder support. Increased shareholder scrutiny of pay comes as banks provide more disclosure on pay to comply with new reporting rules on company remuneration.

-24.3826920423842," One-off costs hit Lloyds Bank profit as rate hike hopes fade LONDON (Reuters) - Lloyds Banking Group has given up hope of a profit-boosting rise in interest rates before 2020, Britain’s biggest mortgage lender said on Thursday, after surprise one-off costs led it to miss quarterly earnings forecasts despite robust underlying profits. The bank reported first-quarter after-tax profits of 1.2 billion pounds ($1.6 billion), up from 1.17 billion pounds in the same period last year but below analysts’ average forecast of 1.39 billion. A drop in home loans and a 339 million pounds one-off charge for “volatility” - that included costs linked to a legal dispute with asset manager Standard Life Aberdeen - sent Lloyds shares down more than 2 percent in early trading. At 0755 GMT, the stock was down 0.7 percent at 63.18 pence. Lloyds also reported a further 100 million pound charge to cover administrative costs linked to a fresh surge in requests for information on possible payment protection insurance claims ahead of an August deadline for payouts. Chief Financial Officer George Culmer said the bank believed an interest rate rise had been pushed back. “Our planning assumption was that we expected a rate rise towards the back end of this year. The market is now pushing that out further into next year and beyond ... And I probably think our thoughts would be moving with the market as well,” he said. Mortgage lending was down 4.9 billion pounds on the previous year in the face of tough competition, partly offset by growth in unsecured credit markets including motor finance. “Our expectation is by the end of the year we’ll be back in line in terms of balances and we expect to close 2019 with mortgage balances in line with the end of 2018,” Culmer told reporters. “So that will probably be slightly below market growth but that’s reflective of the competitive market out there at the moment.” With one-off costs stripped out, the bank reported underlying profit of 2.2 billion pounds, up 8 percent on the previous year and beating expectations of 2.05 billion pounds. The results follow disappointing first-quarter results from Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays, which blamed falling margins on intensifying competition in mortgages and slowing business investment due to Brexit uncertainty. Lloyds said that while Brexit could further impact the economy, it had seen no deterioration in the quality of assets on its loan book and reaffirmed all its financial targets. The bank’s core capital ratio - a key measure of financial strength - increased to 14.2 percent quarter-on-quarter, up from 13.9 percent. Lloyds received a boost on Wednesday after regulators at the Bank of England said it could hold a lower capital buffer against future risks, giving Lloyds a further 1 billion pounds of excess capital which analysts said could be returned to investors. Culmer told reporters the bank would decide what to do with the excess capital at the end of the financial year. The bank has been ramping up payouts for shareholders over the past two years as profits have improved and after returning to fully private ownership in 2017 following a state bailout during the financial crisis. The bank unveiled a better than expected 4 billion pound dividend and share buyback bonanza after full-year results in February, despite weaker profit growth than expected. Lloyds said it had invested 1.2 billion pounds to date under a 3 billion pound three-year strategy to digitize its businesses and bulk up its wealth management operations via a joint venture with Schroders."

Schroders and Lloyds said they were teaming up on the project in October last year, and at the time said it would be led by Schroders’ co-head of intermediary, James Rainbow. Among other top appointments announced on Tuesday, Nick Allen will take on the role of chief operating officer and Marcus Brookes that of chief investment officer, subject to regulatory approval, it said in a statement. “We are making great progress on designing a leading financial planning offering backed by Lloyds Banking Group’s and Schroders’ expertise,” Rainbow said."
-11.391337102646826," Standard Life Aberdeen wins $133 billion Lloyds mandate dispute LONDON (Reuters) - Standard Life Aberdeen said it has won a legal battle to stop Lloyds cancelling a 100 billion pound ($133 billion) investment management contract early, a decision which could cost the bank hundreds of millions of pounds in extra fees. Lloyds had argued the 11 billion pound merger of Standard Life and Aberdeen Asset Management to form SLA in 2017 allowed it to end Aberdeen’s 2014 contract to manage a large slice of its pension assets because it considered insurer Standard Life as a “material competitor”. But after a lengthy arbitration process, a tribunal ruled Lloyds was not entitled to give notice in February 2018 to terminate the deal, raising questions over the status of a new partnership with BlackRock and a wealth management tie-up with Schroders. SLA’s victory also raises the prospect that Lloyds will have to pay some or all of the 390 million pounds the asset manager would have earned under the terms of the contract due to expire in March 2022, even if it continues to transfer assets to BlackRock and Schroders. These charges will come on top of the fees promised to the new partners. “The ruling does not allow any right of appeal. We would expect Lloyds to have to pay compensation. This is likely to be in the order of around 300 million pounds,” KBW analyst Edward Firth said in a note to clients on Tuesday. SLA said it was considering appropriate next steps, while the prospect of a payout had lifted its shares by 1.4 percent at 0814 GMT, while Lloyds shares were up 0.2 percent. “DISAPPOINTED” For Lloyds, “the sums are broadly irrelevant in the context of the Group”, KBW’s Firth said, flagging an ‘outperform’ rating and 67 pence a share target price on its shares. A spokesman for Scottish Widows said the Lloyds-owned insurer was “disappointed” with the ruling but it would press ahead with plans to transfer assets to BlackRock and Schroders. “We will continue to work closely with Standard Life Aberdeen to ensure there is no disruption to performance or service,” the spokesman said. Lloyds awarded BlackRock a contract to manage 30 billion pounds in assets in October, to be invested using the U.S. company’s index strategies in one of Europe’s biggest investment contracts of last year. Previously Lloyds said the BlackRock deal would begin after the arbitration process or when the existing contract expires."

Lloyds had argued that an 11 billion pound merger between fund firms Standard Life and Aberdeen triggered the right to review an agreement struck in 2014 for Aberdeen to manage its pension assets on behalf of its wealth and insurance businesses, because it saw Standard Life as a “material competitor” to both.

-11.436615810214992," Inquiry into Lloyds' handling of HBOS fraud slips to 2020: source LONDON (Reuters) - A long-awaited probe into what Lloyds Banking Group executives knew about one of Britain’s worst ever banking frauds is now not likely to be completed until next year, a source with knowledge of the review said. The investigation by retired high court judge Linda Dobbs was launched in 2017 to assess whether Lloyds properly investigated and reported the fraud at HBOS, which it bought in January 2009. Lloyds is paying for the review but has said its conclusions will be independent. “The independent Dame Linda Dobbs Review will continue to have all the time and resources it needs to complete its important work,” a spokeswoman for Lloyds said. HBOS was once Britain’s biggest mortgage lender, and was rescued in a state-engineered takeover by Lloyds, which has apologized to victims of the fraud and set up a 100 million pounds ($133 million) compensation scheme. A team of more than 30 lawyers is sifting hundreds of thousands of Lloyds documents, the source said, as well as interviewing victims of the fraud for which six people were jailed for a combined 47 years in 2017. The inquiry will begin interviewing Lloyds executives from the Autumn, the source said, starting with more junior bankers and likely to include Chief Executive Antonio Horta-Osorio. The work involves sifting through the documents to build a picture of what Lloyds’ senior executives knew about the fraud, what they did about it and when. Lloyds has said that while it was aware of misconduct, it could not have known about the criminal nature of the fraud until the trial in 2017. Britain’s influential cross-party Treasury Committee of lawmakers in June 2018 wrote to Dobbs asking when the review would be complete, and Dobbs said at that time it would slip into the second half of 2019, confirming a Reuters story from May that year. “The delay is totally unacceptable. People want answers, this has been going on for 10 years and we still have not got to the bottom of this issue.” Kevin Hollinrake, chair of the cross-party parliamentary group for fair banking, told Reuters on Thursday about the fresh delay. “I’m not questioning Dame Linda Dobbs’ integrity at all but it’s simply wrong that regulators are not taking the lead on this,” he said. Lloyds in November 2018 settled with an ex-employee who accused her former bosses of concealing the fraud. The bank apologized to Sally Masterton, a former senior risk officer at Lloyds, and said that it had agreed to pay her financial compensation. Masterton alleged HBOS executives knew of the fraud years before the Lloyds takeover and failed to properly disclose it. The fraud, which took place in the early 2000s, saw the conspirators use their positions to enrich themselves at the expense of struggling business clients, some of which succumbed to insolvency and were stripped of their assets after being advised to borrow unsustainable amounts."

-10.173335546416027," Lloyds' overdraft charges 'fly in the face' of transparency, say UK lawmakers LONDON, Mar 1 (Reuters) - Lawmakers have criticized a move by Britain’s Lloyds Banking Group to impose more expensive and complex overdraft fees on customers only months before a regulatory clampdown. Nicky Morgan, chair of the powerful Treasury Select Committee, said the charges by Britain’s biggest domestic bank “fly in the face” of clarity and transparency. Lloyds, which has a 38 percent market share in basic bank accounts, began rolling out a tiered system of overdraft charges from last month, increasing charges for anyone borrowing less than about 4,100 pounds ($5,443). The bank previously charged a flat daily rate of 1 pence per 7 pounds of borrowing, but the new staggered charges start at 1 pence for every 6 pounds of credit, meaning more fees are racked up on lower sums. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has published proposals to drive down high overdraft costs, including a ban on tiered charges, with enforcement potentially starting as early as December. The watchdog said the average arranged overdraft across the British banking sector is about 250 pounds. “It’s puzzling that whilst welcoming the FCA’s simplification proposals, Lloyds Banking Group has introduced such a complex tiered system for – potentially – a relatively short period of time,” Morgan said. In a letter to Morgan, Lloyds Chief Executive Antonio Horta-Osorio defended the fee changes and said the bank had already moved to help customers by removing higher charges on unplanned overdrafts, in line with the FCA’s recent proposals. A spokesman for Lloyds said the lender would reflect on the points raised by the Treasury Select Committee. The spokseman added: “We have been working closely with the FCA and other stakeholders on overdrafts and we are fully participating in the FCA’s consultation process. “Overdrafts are an important issue and we will continue to listen to the views of the FCA and other stakeholders on the need to bring more clarity and transparency.”"

-1.8767853784701582," UK bank CEOs paid 120 times as much as average employee LONDON (Reuters) - The top bosses of Britain’s biggest banks are paid on average 120 times more than the median pay of their U.K. employees, bank documents have shown, as a new rule puts pay disparities at the country’s big businesses under sharper scrutiny. Britain’s biggest domestic lender Lloyds Banking Group has the starkest pay difference, with Chief Executive Antonio Horta-Osorio - the sector’s highest-earning boss in 2018 - on 169 times as much as the median paid employee on 37,058 pounds ($48,164), the company’s annual report showed last Wednesday. The gulf widens to 237 times when compared with staff in Lloyds’ lowest pay quartile, who received an average pay package of 26,490 pounds in 2018, compared with the 6.3 million pounds Horta-Osorio took home. The banks made the disclosures alongside full-year results over the past fortnight, ahead of new reporting requirements coming into force next year that oblige firms to set out the ratio of CEO pay to a median UK employee and those in the lowest and upper pay quartiles. Banking giant HSBC had the next largest pay disparity, with new chief executive John Flint pocketing 4.6 million pounds last year - 118 times as much as its median paid employee in Britain. “HSBC’s pay strategy is designed to appropriately reflect the role, responsibility and skills of the individual and to also be competitive in order to ensure we are able to attract and retain individuals with the appropriate skills for each role,” a spokeswoman for the bank said. CEO to median employee pay ratios at rival FTSE 100 lenders Royal Bank of Scotland and Barclays were not too far behind, at 97:1 and 96:1 respectively. Barclays, Lloyds and RBS declined to comment. Pay disparities have come under closer scrutiny in Britain in recent years, with separate gender pay-gap reporting requirements highlighting wide discrepancies between women and men, particularly in the finance industry. The pay ratio reporting comes as the City of London Corporation, which manages London’s financial district, on Monday launched a campaign against low pay at financial firms. The body is urging companies to pay their staff at least the London Living Wage of 10.55 pounds ($13.73) per hour. “One in five people employed in the capital don’t earn a wage they can live on. I’m calling on City firms to help consign this statistic to the history books,” said Catherine McGuinness, the City’s policy chief. In its annual report Lloyds said it would pay all its full-time staff a minimum salary of 17,500 pounds from April this year, which it said would mean a raise of up to 9.9 percent for some colleagues. Lloyds said this salary level was 7 percent above the National Living Wage, but it did not refer to the higher London Living Wage. Large pay ratio gaps remain despite the four banks showing relative restraint last year, with pay for the quartet of CEOs broadly flat or down on the prior year. Horta-Osorio’s pay packet was down from 6.4 million pounds in 2017, while Flint received less than his predecessor Stuart Gulliver’s 6.1 million pounds. RBS boss Ross McEwan made 3.6 million pounds, up from 3.5 million pounds, while Barclays chief Jes Staley was the lowest paid after earning 3.4 million pounds, down from 3.9 million pounds."
-1.8096475613614185," Breakingviews - Brexit and costs cloud Lloyds’ sunlit uplands LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Brexiteers like to describe the ‘sunlit uplands’ awaiting the nation’s departure from the European Union. Investors in the country’s largest retail bank aren’t so sure. Lloyds Banking Group shares look cheap when weighed against CEO Antonio Horta-Osorio’s plan to hit a 15 percent return on equity. That relies on a steep fall in one-off costs and an easy Brexit. So far the latter has left Lloyds’ profit blissfully undisturbed. Sure, loan losses increased by nearly one-fifth year-on-year, but from an extremely low base to a manageable 937 million pounds. Rather, it was the fall in so-called ‘one-off’ items which helped drive up profit: pre-tax profit increased by 13 percent year-on-year to 5.9 billion pounds due largely to a decrease in provisions for missold payment protection insurance (PPI). The return on tangible equity rose 2.8 percentage points to 11.7 percent. Horta-Osorio thinks he can repeat the trick this year, and is promising a 14 percent to 15 percent return. Maybe. PPI provisions should fall further, given an August deadline for compensation. So should nearly 900 million pounds in restructuring charges given the integration of credit card lender MBNA is largely complete. The snag is that supposedly exceptional charges have bedevilled Lloyds for years. If Lloyds can roughly halve the one-off nasties to 1.4 billion pounds, plus lower operating expenses by another 200 million pounds to around 8 billion pounds, Horta-Osorio can just about hit his 14 percent minimum return target, according to a Breakingviews calculation which assumes flat revenue, a 20 percent rise in bad debts similar to last year, and a 27 percent tax rate. A share buyback would nudge it further towards the 15 percent upper-end target. The trickier bit is Brexit. A chaotic exit, or even extended period of political uncertainty, would push up loan losses. Analysts are already pencilling in a roughly 37 percent year-on-year jump to 1.3 billion pounds, according to Refinitv. Given that Lloyds has massively grown its share of unsecured lending, where losses heavily correlate with unemployment, that could prove optimistic. Horta-Osorio can at least plausibly argue that Brexit is out of Lloyds’ control. His stock is trading at 1.1 times book tangible book value, suggesting the market is not panicking, but not giving him full credit for the 15 percent target. Increasing the premium remains contingent on goodwill between London and Brussels. Investors are right to remain nervous."
-1.8096475613614185," Lloyds Bank brushes off Brexit fears with $5 billion investor payout LONDON (Reuters) - Lloyds Banking Group shrugged off mounting concerns over Brexit to unveil a 4 billion pound ($5.2 billion) dividend and share buyback bonanza for investors on Wednesday, despite weaker than expected growth in profits for 2018. Britain’s biggest mortgage lender posted a 24 percent rise in net profits to 4.4 billion pounds, below expectations of 4.6 billion pounds, according to a company-provided average of analyst forecasts. It pledged to pay a 3.21 pence per share total dividend, up 5 percent, and unveiled a 1.75 billion pound share buyback. That would still leave the bank’s core capital ratio -- a key measure of financial strength -- at 13.9 percent. The bank’s bumper payout and confident tone on the economy struck a contrast with rivals Royal Bank of Scotland and HSBC, which in the last week both reported taking provisions against Brexit amid concerns bad loans could rise. Lloyds shares rose 2.7 percent, outperforming a 1 percent rise in the FTSE 350 banks index. Britain’s largest domestic bank resisted any suggestion of complacency in its outlook for the economy, saying it recognized uncertainties existed. Chief Executive António Horta Osório said he was betting on a last minute accord between British Prime Minister Theresa May and the EU on the future trading relationship between Britain and the bloc. “We are planning for a deal and a smooth Brexit transition that should lead the economy to grow at around the same pace you have now of about 1-1.5 percent,” the Portuguese CEO told reporters. “Of course other scenarios can play out ... Irrespective of that our business model is the right one and it is true that we face the future with confidence, otherwise we would not be ramping up our investment in this business.” The bank said it had spent 1 billion pounds on digitizing its business and bulking up its wealth management operations, as it seeks to expand into the financial planning and retirement market via a joint venture with Schroders. Lloyds is seen as hugely exposed to any downturn through its billions of pounds of lending to British consumers and businesses. In recent weeks the Bank of England has warned Britain faces its weakest economic growth in a decade, with a one in four chance of a recession this year. Despite Lloyds’ bullish tone on the economy, impairments for the year increased by 18 percent to 937 million pounds as the bank integrated the MBNA credit card portfolio it bought from Bank of America in 2017. Lloyds also set aside a further 200 million pounds to compensate customers missold payment protection insurance, taking its total provision to 750 million pounds in 2018. Horta-Osorio’s total pay package for the year slipped to 6.3 million pounds from 6.4 million pounds the previous year, but remains significantly higher than his counterparts at RBS and HSBC. The bank’s shares remain at a similar level to when he took over the reins in January 2011, despite its profits rising steadily each year since, a factor which analysts attributed to investors concerns about Britain’s uncertain outlook. (Graphic: Lloyds shares under CEO Horta-Osorio - tmsnrt.rs/2U0FxvO) “Lloyds is indelibly plugged into the UK economy, and the shadow cast by Brexit means the bank’s shares are left out in the cold. If there’s a positive resolution to the current political uncertainty, we would expect the shares to rally,” said Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown."

The FTSE 100 was up 0.3 percent and the FTSE 250 up 0.1 percent by 0844 GMT. A decline by shopping centre owner Intu limited gains on the mid-cap index. Sainsbury’s fell nearly 13 percent after Britain’s competition regulator said its deal with Walmart-owned Asda should either be blocked entirely or require the sale of a significant number of stores and possibly one of the brands. The stock was on track for its worst day since October 2008. Shares of Morrisons and Tesco tumbled as well. “The implication of these proposals are that an exit of Walmart from the UK grocery market now seems less likely,” Jefferies analysts said. Intu Properties dropped 10 percent after it scrapped its dividend, under pressure from several retail bankruptcies. Shares of rival Hammerson fell 3 percent. Glencore rose 3 percent after announcing a $2 billion share buyback and an 8 percent rise in full-year adjusted core earnings. Lloyds Banking Group shares was among those gaining the most.

Until now the lender’s Berlin office has run on a standard passporting licence that Lloyds - and other British lenders with customers in the EU - stand to lose when Britain leaves the bloc. With only 71 days to go until the planned March 29 departure, Britain’s banks are forging ahead with plans to ensure they can keep serving customers in the EU if political stalemate over the withdrawal agreement results in Britain crashing out without a deal. Lloyds’ Berlin office, located on the city’s famous Alexanderplatz, was a former Bank of Scotland branch the group inherited when it took over HBOS at the peak of the financial crisis a decade ago. Lloyds employs around 300 people in Berlin, including a full management team, finance, risk and human resources staff, who serve its retail and corporate banking customers in Europe. As part of transforming the Berlin branch into a full subsidiary, its capital will require bolstering by Lloyds, by a sum in the low hundreds of millions of pounds, Reuters has reported. Licences the bank has applied for in Frankfurt and Luxembourg remain outstanding, the source added, but the bank is expected to have all regulatory approvals in place by March 29. The need for multiple subsidiaries with different licences is due in part to British ring-fencing rules put in place after the 2008 financial crisis, which require depositors’ money to be separated from riskier investment banking activities. The Lloyds Luxembourg hub will serve the bank’s longstanding life insurance customers, Reuters reported in September, while the Frankfurt unit will house the bank’s EU-based bond-trading business. Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) is not far behind rival Lloyds in its efforts to secure its own German licence, and Chairman Howard Davies was in Frankfurt on Tuesday for talks with German regulator Bafin. The licence would be in addition to an existing licence held by its Amsterdam-based NatWest Markets business and ensure access to euro payment and euro liquidity markets via the German Bundesbank. Last month the state-owned bank said it planned to move 6 billion pounds ($7.74 billion) of assets and 7 billion pounds of liabilities to the Dutch subsidiary as early as March, unless a deal is reached between Britain and the EU.

9.154914150608462," British lawmaker seeks probe into Lloyds CEO's handling of fraud case LONDON, Nov 21 (Reuters) - A senior lawmaker has demanded an investigation into the way the chief executive of Lloyds Banking Group handled information related to one of Britain’s biggest fraud cases. Kevin Hollinrake, the chairman of the parliamentary group for banking, said on Wednesday he had notified Lloyds CEO Antonio Horta-Osorio that he had written to the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) about the case involving the Reading unit of HBOS, which Lloyds acquired in 2009. He said he had asked the regulator “to open an investigation of these events under the Senior Managers and Certification Regime,” a set of powers brought in after the financial crisis to better police the conduct of executives. Lloyds said this month it had settled with Sally Masterton, a former Lloyds senior risk officer who accused former bosses of concealing fraud at the HBOS Reading unit prior to a cash call needed to keep the combined group afloat in 2009. The bank apologised to Masterton and paid her compensation. The bank, which said it handed Masterton’s report to regulators and the police in 2014, reopened her case this year over the way it treated her and handled her allegations. In his letter to the Lloyds boss, Hollinrake alleged that internal bank correspondence showed that Horta-Osorio was aware of the scale of the fraud “as early as 2011”, when he joined. “Our concerns relate to the allegations of the cover-up of the fraud rather than the fraud itself,” Hollinrake wrote. Asked about the allegations in Hollinrake’s letter, the bank said it was “determined to get to the bottom of what happened in HBOS Reading” and was co-operating with an inquiry. The FCA is investigating HBOS but details about the exact nature of the probe are unclear. The watchdog did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. Six people were jailed in 2017 for a combined 47 years over the fraud at the HBOS Reading, in which struggling firms were asset stripped by managers at the lender in the early 2000s. British TV presenter Noel Edmonds alleges his entertainment company collapsed as a result of the fraud, and has previously refused a financial settlement offer from the bank. Lawyers for Edmonds say they are preparing to serve Lloyds with a civil claim worth more than 30 million pounds on Thursday.

-3.9735120507453683," Britain's Lloyds agrees settlement with HBOS whistleblower LONDON (Reuters) - Lloyds Banking Group said on Wednesday it had settled with an ex-employee who accused former bosses of concealing a massive fraud at its HBOS Reading unit, prior to a record-breaking cash call needed to keep the combined group afloat in 2009. The bank apologized to Sally Masterton, a former senior risk officer at Lloyds, and said that it had agreed to pay her financial compensation. Britain’s biggest mortgage lender, which took over HBOS in 2009, reopened Masterton’s case earlier this year after coming under pressure over its treatment of her and how it handled her allegations. That followed the publication of a report, written by Masterton in 2013, which alleged HBOS executives knew of the fraud years before the takeover and failed to properly disclose it, with implications for the HBOS deal. On Wednesday, Lloyds said Masterton had acted with integrity and good faith at all times, and that she documented her concerns in a report following a request from the bank - a point it had previously disputed. “I am pleased that Lloyds Banking Group has listened to me... and has recognized the distress and inconvenience this has caused me,” Masterton said in a separate statement. She took leave from her duties at the bank and left in 2014, having never returned to work there. The publication of Masterton’s allegations, in a document known as the Project Lord Turnbull report, revived criticisms of Lloyds’ handling of one of the industry’s worst-ever frauds, weighing on the reputation it has worked hard to rebuild in the years since the financial crisis. The fraud, which took place in the early 2000s, saw the conspirators use their positions to enrich themselves at the expense of struggling business clients, some of which succumbed to insolvency and were stripped of their assets after being advised to borrow unsustainable amounts. Six people were jailed for a combined 47 years for the fraud in February 2017. Lloyds has apologized to victims and set up a 100 million pound compensation scheme.

In a separate statement, Lloyds confirmed it is creating 2,000 net new jobs to help it provide more digital banking products and services. “The group is investing to further digitise the bank and will refresh some existing roles and create new roles within its structure,” the bank said. Around three-quarters of the jobs are expected to be filled by existing Lloyds staff and the cuts are not targeted at branch staff. The lender has said it would invest 3 billion pounds ($3.9 billion) in technology and staff in response to customers’ declining use of branches and competition from tech-savvy upstart firms with far cheaper cost bases. All of Britain’s high street lenders have been reducing their physical networks and focusing on technology to try to ward off threats from smaller, more nimble rivals and as customers increasingly look to bank online and via mobile apps.

6.968644370592624," Landmark pensions ruling may cost Lloyds Banking Group $192 mln * Judge says Lloyds must ensure equal pension treatment * Landmark ruling could impact thousands of other employers * Government also watched case closely * Decision could cost bank $192 mln LONDON, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Lloyds Banking Group must amend its pension schemes to equalise benefits for men and women following a court ruling that could cost the bank up to 150 million pounds ($191.97 million) and affect thousands of other companies. In a case closely watched by the government, Judge Paul Morgan ruled that Lloyds’ pension trustee had a duty to amend the schemes to equalise treatment after three female members claimed discrimination, with women’s pensions increasing at a slower rate than those of men in the schemes. The case affects around 230,000 members of the bank’s pension schemes, but union BTU has said it could have implications for as many as 7.8 million people in thousands of other schemes across the country, with the cost of equalising all affected pensions put at up to 20 billion pounds. “These issues have created uncertainties in the occupational pensions industry in this country for many years,” Morgan said in his written ruling, seen by Reuters on Friday. The judge stipulated a number of methods Lloyds could use to achieve equal treatment for men and women, which could require the bank to pay between 100 million pounds and 150 million pounds. Union BTU had previously said the case could cost the bank up to 500 million pounds. Britain’s Treasury and Department for Work and Pensions were listed as “interested parties” in the case because of its consequences for the wider public sector. “It is time now for trustees to roll up their sleeves and start to assess the implications and possible remedial actions,” said Chantal Thompson, pensions partner at law firm Baker McKenzie, adding the implications would be far reaching. The case relates to employees that had their secondary state pension payments - supplementary to their basic state pension - paid by their employer rather than the government under an arrangement known as “contracting out”. Both the employee and the employer benefited from lower tax contributions, while the employer would guarantee to pay a minimum amount broadly equivalent to what the employee would have received from the government. But under the arrangements, the calculation employers were required to use to determine pension benefits created inequalities. While in some cases men received a smaller amount, in most instances it was women who were negatively affected. A Lloyds spokeswoman said in a statement it was working through the details in order to implement the court’s decision. “The hearing focused on what is a complex and longstanding industry-wide issue. The group welcomes the decision made by the court and the clarity it provides.”"
5.136979004805601," Britain's Lloyds Bank downplays Brexit fears as profits rise LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Lloyds Banking Group LLOY.L shrugged off fears of a chaotic, no-deal Brexit and pledged to keep pumping credit into the economy regardless of the outcome of negotiations between Brussels and London. The bank’s finance chief George Culmer told reporters on Thursday that Lloyds remains hopeful that the two sides can secure a deal before Brexit day in March 2019, when the UK will undergo its biggest policy shift in four decades. “There is great uncertainty out there, but our continued expectation is for some sort of withdrawal agreement going forward,” Culmer said, adding that 97 percent of the bank’s business is UK-focused. “What is fundamental is that we continue to support our customers whatever the outcome.” Reuters this month reported that the Bank of England had laid out a contingency plan to ensure that banks such as Lloyds, Britain’s biggest mortgage lender, do not suddenly slam the brakes on lending in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Lloyds, which is a bellwether for the economy given its broad exposure to UK consumers, said it had seen no change in customers’ ability to repay debt. Despite lengthy talks between Britain and the European Union, the terms of divorce remain uncertain five months before the country leaves the bloc with or without a deal. That has clouded confidence in British lenders and helped to drag down Lloyds’ share price by 17 percent this year despite its strong performance. Lloyds shares remained flat at the market open after it reported a third-quarter pretax profit of 1.8 billion pounds ($2.32 billion), outperforming the 1.7 billion pound average from company-compiled analyst estimates. It was helped by a growing net interest margin - a key measure of bank profitability - and falling costs. The net interest margin rose 8 basis points to 2.93 percent. Lloyds also said it had grown its lending to small businesses and in higher-margin areas such as car finance - two strategic aims laid out in the three-year plan laid out in February. The bank aims to digitize operations and grow outside of core markets such as mortgages, where it has effectively exhausted opportunities for significant growth. Another key ambition is an increased presence in insurance and wealth, where the bank has secured two partnerships in recent weeks. The bank reported a core capital ratio of 15.5 percent, up from 14.9 percent a year ago, reflecting continued efforts to make its balance sheet recession-proof. CFO Culmer said the bank is likely to return some of that excess capital to shareholders, with the board set to make a decision after December. In a separate statement, the bank said Culmer, who played a key role in turning Lloyds around after its 20.3 billion pound bailout in 2008, would retire after interim results in 2019."

Schroders, Britain’s second largest listed fund management group by assets under management, and Lloyds, its biggest retail lender, said they would launch a financial planning joint venture after confirming earlier this month they were in talks. The deal, the highest profile of its kind between a British bank and fund manager, combines Schroders’ investment offering with Lloyds’ 27 million-strong customer base and wide distribution network. It revives a traditional partnership model between banks and insurers that has dominated in mainland Europe for decades. “The aim is to become a top three UK financial planning business within five years,” said Antonio Lorenzo, director of insurance and wealth at Lloyds and chief executive of its subsidiary Scottish Widows. The bank launched a renewed push into insurance and wealth earlier this year. It is already a market leader in its core products like mortgages, and the limited opportunity for growth in key markets has helped drag its share price down 17 percent this year. For Schroders, the deal is likely to boost its ability to sell its broad range of equity and fixed income products to Lloyds customers, and is the latest move in a long-standing plan to diversify its revenues. “We think this move makes good sense for both parties,” Bernstein analyst Edward Houghton said of the deal, which follows a series of mergers and tie-ups in the asset management sector. Schroders shares were down 4.2 percent at 2,649 pence at 1540 GMT on Monday afternoon, as the UK’s main stock benchmark, the FTSE 100, fell 1.2 percent. Lloyds shares were flat, down just 0.07 percent to 56.4 pence. Lloyds’ CEO Antonio Horta-Osorio and Schroders Chief Executive Peter Harrison welcomed the deal, under which Lloyds will own 50.1 percent of the new entity and Schroders 49.9 percent. The venture, whose branding was not outlined in the statement, will be led by a management team compromising representatives from both parties. Lloyds’ Lorenzo will be its chairman, while James Rainbow, Schroders’ co-head of UK intermediary, will be its chief executive. Schroders also won an 80 billion-pound investment contract from Lloyds, 67 billion of which represents a large part of the 109 billion-pound mandate that Lloyds pulled from previous manager Standard Life Aberdeen earlier this year. The assets previously managed by SLA are subject to arbitration, after SLA disputed Lloyds’ right to terminate the contract. However the statement said they will transfer to Schroders whatever the outcome of this process, either once arbitration concludes or when the bank’s contract with SLA expires in March 2022, and remain with the firm for at least five years. Lloyds has been using negotiations over the mandate to leverage partnerships that support its push into the sector. It also handed 30 billion pounds of the assets to BlackRock in return for an alliance. The joint venture with Schroders, which the firms aim to have in operation by the end of the first half of 2019, will offer a personalised, advice-led service focused on affluent customers, the companies said in a joint statement. Lloyds will transfer 13 billion pounds of assets and associated advisers from its existing wealth management business to the joint venture, and a further 400 million pounds of its private client assets to Schroders as soon as possible, they said. Under the deal, Lloyds will also take a 19.9 percent stake in Schroders’ UK wealth management business. St James’s Place, Britain’s largest standalone listed wealth manager, on Tuesday posted a 4.1 percent rise in third-quarter funds under management to pass 100 billion pounds for the first time."

-6.953654968319673," Britain's Lloyds awards $40 billion investment contract to BlackRock LONDON (Reuters) - Lloyds Banking Group LLOY.L has awarded BlackRock BLK.N a 30 billion pound ($40 billion) slice of one of Europe's biggest investment contracts to be invested using the U.S. company's various index strategies. The award to the world's biggest asset manager follows a high-profile bidding competition kick-started early this year after Lloyds said it was yanking 109 billion pounds in assets from current manager Standard Life Aberdeen SLA.L. That surprise move followed the 11 billion pound merger of original manager Aberdeen Asset Management and insurer Standard Life, which Lloyds said made the combined company a material competitor - a charge SLA is currently fighting. Lloyds on Friday said that it would also look to agree a strategic partnership with BlackRock to collaborate in alternative asset classes, risk management and investment technology. “BlackRock has been selected following a competitive tender process in which it clearly demonstrated its global market-leading capabilities and deep expertise in the UK market,” Antonio Lorenzo, chief executive of Scottish Widows and group director of insurance & wealth, said in a statement. Lloyds-owned Scottish Widows and Lloyds’ wealth management division contributed assets to the 109 billion pound mandate with SLA. “The partnership will ensure that Scottish Widows and the group can deliver good investment outcomes for its customers over the coming years,” Lorenzo added. Lloyds said the BlackRock deal would begin after an arbitration process over the SLA contract termination concludes or when the existing contract expires, adding that it is confident in its right to end the SLA deal. SLA, which is seeking 250 million pounds in compensation, declined to comment. Lloyds said that, after a review by Scottish Widows and Lloyds’ wealth unit of their asset management arrangements, it is also near to announcing plans for the remaining 80 billion pounds in assets and would update the market in due course. Lloyds has been using the mandate transfer to leverage partnerships with asset managers towards the aim of growing its presence in the insurance and wealth sector - an ambition that formed a key pillar of its most recent three-year strategy, laid out in February. Already holding a top share of its core banking markets, a push into other sectors offers Lloyds an opportunity for growth it has exhausted in products such as mortgages.

-10.561060778988335," Schroders targets British wealth boost with Lloyds tie-up LONDON (Reuters) - Schroders SDR.L could soon help manage the money of people with significantly less in their bank accounts than the super-rich it has targeted so far, if talks with Lloyds LLOY.L about a wealth management tie-up succeed. Schroders, Britain’s second largest listed fund management group by assets under management and Lloyds Banking Group, Britain’s biggest retail lender, confirmed on Sunday they are in talks, but gave no further details. However, sources familiar with the discussions confirmed details of a Sky News report which said Lloyds would roll 13.8 billion pounds ($18 billion) of client money into a joint venture with Schroders, which would contribute its technology, operational platform and investment skills. This would allow Schroders to access thousands of so-called mass affluent, those with hundreds of thousands of pounds, rather than millions or billions, in investable capital. It would be the latest step in a long-standing plan by Schroders to diversify its revenues and follow other recent acquisitions in the sector as the industry consolidates. Rathbone RAT.L bought Scotland's Speirs & Jeffrey for 104 million pounds earlier this year, but as one of the only large British asset managers with a significant wealth management arm, analysts do not expect the Schroders talks to trigger copy-cat deals. “A relationship with Lloyds could be an important source of new assets in Schroders’ home market. This points to management’s flexibility in the way it goes to market and to its savvy around building distribution relationships,” Bernstein analyst Edward Houghton said in a note to investors. Lloyds LLOY.L, which is looking for ways to diversify its business mix from banking, where further expansion is limited, has targeted insurance and wealth and made them a key pillar of its most recent three-year strategy outlined in February. The bank, which would own 50.1 percent of the joint venture, stood to gain from Schroders’ investment skills and greater diversification, analysts said. Lloyds is also discussing taking a minority stake in Schroders’ Cazenove Capital wealth management arm, which manages the money of its existing wealthy clients. The third pillar of the deal would see Schroders secure a high-profile new business mandate to manage 109 billion pounds of Lloyd’s insurance assets. This has been up for grabs since February, when Lloyds ended a management deal with newly-merged Standard Life Aberdeen SLA.L which it said had become a ""material competitor"". The annual revenue associated with the Lloyds asset management contracts represented around 130 million pounds. Since then, several of the world’s biggest asset managers have competed for the mandate, which analysts at UBS said could add between 5 and 7 percent to Schroders earnings. “It would give Schroders an important scale advantage when attempting to win further mandates from insurers, given the scale-driven nature of the business,” they said, flagging a price target of 3,600 pence and ‘buy’ rating. Schroders, whose shares were 0.2 percent lower at 1216 GMT, saw its existing wealth management business post a solid first half, with net income up 8 percent to 144 million pounds and pre-tax profit of 38 million pounds. The FTSE 100 .FTSE index was down 0.7 percent. For Lloyds, whose shares were down 0.9 percent, the plans involve leveraging its position to be able to offer insurance and wealth services under the same roof via its insurance subsidiary Scottish Widows. “Something like this I think will be transformative from the perspective of the growth of that business,” John Cronin, financials analyst at Goodbody, told Reuters.

The CMA said Lloyds had failed to send annual reviews, which have been required by the regulator since 2011, to around 14,000 of its PPI customers. The reviews set out how much customers need to pay and their right to cancel the policy. Some of the reviews that were sent by the bank also contained incorrect figures, the CMA said. Lloyds, one of the worst offenders in Britain’s costliest mis-selling scandal, had already breached a 2011 order by the CMA outlining how PPI providers should operate six times previously. “We are disappointed that Lloyds has again failed to provide these important reminders or provide accurate data to its customers,” Adam Land, the CMA’s senior director of remedies, business and financial analysis, said in a statement. “These are serious breaches.” The bank, which has already paid out over 18 billion pounds ($23.37 billion) in compensation over mis-sold PPI and had hoped to have drawn a line under the scandal, said it was writing to affected customers. “Whilst we have resolved the cause of the issue, we are extremely sorry for any inconvenience caused,” a spokesman said in a statement. Under the new directions issued by the CMA, Lloyds will need to provide more detailed information on its compliance with the CMA’s order, report breaches within 14 days and appoint an independent body to review its compliance systems each year. It will also have to strengthen its monitoring and take steps to ensure its systems remain robust during migrations.

The lender’s efforts to adapt to declining footfall in branches and the growing use of mobile and digital banking have seen it increasingly focus on technology and tech-savvy staff at the expense of bricks-and-mortar and manual processes. “All branches announced for closure will have a Post Office less than half-a-mile away, so customers can still access their banking locally,” the spokeswoman said in a statement. Accord, a union, said up to 23 jobs will be lost as a result of the cuts, but it expects that could be managed without compulsory redundancy, in the same way as the bank’s previous branch closures.

The changes, resulting in a net increase of 55 positions, are part of the bank’s latest three-year strategy. Announced in February, it will see Lloyds invest 3.0 billion pounds ($3.9 billion) into technology and staff as it looks to adapt to the increasing popularity of digital banking and declining footfall in branches. The trend, combined with a drive to cut costs, has seen Britain’s biggest banks axe thousands of jobs and close hundreds of branches in recent years. The Royal Bank of Scotland also said on Wednesday it would axe 258 jobs as part of plans to shutter 54 of its outlets. A Lloyds spokeswoman said the new roles will be created in the bank’s transformation division, with a focus on engineering and design to enable the bank to offer more leading-edge products and services. “Whilst today’s announcements will result in an overall net increase in the number of roles within our organisation ... it does involve making difficult decisions,” the spokeswoman continued. “The group’s policy is always to use natural turnover and to redeploy people in the first instance.” Hefty branch closures and job cuts have become a source of criticism for Britain’s banks, with lawmakers and campaigners condemning lenders for cutting some off from in-person banking services. Lloyds has cut over 1,300 roles already this year, as well as creating different positions, in its bid to compete with rivals and smaller financial technology firms on digital initiatives. Accord, a union representing Lloyds’ staff, said on its website the changes will hit the bank’s commercial banking, people and productivity, retail and transformation divisions. “Whilst on the face of it the plans look positive, not all existing colleagues will have the transferable skills for the newly created roles and will mean some face redundancy,” the union said."

-6.137245011811082," Britain's Lloyds bank to stop financing new coal plants, thermal coal mines LONDON (Reuters) - Lloyds Banking Group said on Thursday it will not fund new coal-fired power stations or thermal coal mines, or bank new clients that derive most of their revenue from either of these operations. The new policy brings Lloyds in line with peers Royal Bank of Scotland and HSBC, which both announced similar changes earlier this year as lenders update their approach amid growing concerns about coal’s impact on the environment. David Oldfield, group director of commercial banking at Lloyds, pointed to the landmark accord agreed between almost 200 nations at a Paris summit in 2015 to limit climate change, which was seen as marking a global turn away from fossil fuels. “To achieve the aims set out in the 2015 Paris Agreement, continued reduction in the amount of coal mined and used to generate electricity is needed. This announcement reiterates our commitment to support the transition,” he said in a statement."
-8.140340676468574," Britain's Lloyds Bank optimistic about economy as profit jumps LONDON (Reuters) - Lloyds Banking Group LLOY.L gave an upbeat assessment about the British economy in the face of Brexit after the country's biggest mortgage lender reported a 23 percent jump in first-half profit despite an additional mis-selling charge. Lloyds’ focus on the domestic economy leaves its earnings exposed to the risks of Britain’s departure from the European Union, but the bank’s management said it had seen few signs of Brexit-related strain on the economy even as concerns rise about whether the two sides can reach a deal in time. “The UK economy remains resilient and, excluding the impact of adverse weather, continues to demonstrate robust growth,” said Antonio Horta-Osorio, Chief Executive of the bank. The bank’s exposure to consumers’ finances via mortgages and unsecured lending such as credit cards make it a bellwether for the British economy. Its pretax profit reached 3.1 billion pounds ($4.07 billion)for the period until end-June. It was expected to book 3.2 billion pounds, according to a bank-compiled average of forecasts provided to Reuters by an analyst. The bank’s shares were up 2 percent at 0844 GMT. An additional 460 million pound provision for the mis-sale of payment protection insurance (PPI) was an “unwelcome development” but Lloyds’ strong results gave it the benefit of the doubt, said Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor. One of Britain’s costliest banking scandals, PPI has cost Lloyds alone 18.8 billion pounds so far and the bank had hoped to draw a line under it. “The issue has cast a long shadow over the sector and Lloyds in particular,” Hunter said, adding that it could add to concerns about an economic downturn after Brexit. The bank said its full-year forecast for its net interest margin - an indicator of bank profitability - was now in line with the figure for the first half of the year, which was at 2.93 percent. George Culmer, Lloyds chief financial officer, said this forecast factored in one interest rate increase this year. The Bank of England is expected to hike rates on Thursday. While banks tend to benefit from rising interest rates, they can also put a strain on indebted consumers that owe them money. Lloyds said it had made good progress on its three-year strategy, laid out in February and aimed at bolstering its retail lending business against increasing competition from both established rivals and upstart financial technology firms. It reported a common equity tier one capital ratio - a measure of banks’ financial strength - of 15.1 percent pre-dividend. The bank would pay an interim dividend of 1.07 pence per share, it said."

-11.676673193906554," British lawmakers criticize Lloyds' fraud redress scheme as 'unfair' LONDON (Reuters) - A group of British lawmakers on Monday wrote to the financial watchdog and the board of Lloyds Banking Group LLOY.L accusing the bank of ""victim blaming"" and ""unfairness"" in its redress scheme for victims of a fraud at its HBOS Reading division. The letters, signed by lawmaker Kevin Hollinrake, who chairs the All Party Parliamentary Group for Fair Business Banking, said compensation offers the bank had made were insufficient and that it was treating victims with contempt. “We have no trust in such an opaque process,” he continued, in his letter to the Lloyds board. “The arrogance of this approach can no longer be countenanced,” the letter said. A Lloyds spokeswoman said the bank was in regular dialogue with Hollinrake and the APPG. “The customer compensation review was set up to deliver swift and fair compensation to customers,” she said, adding the bank had paid for all customers to take legal advice before entering into any settlement agreement. Hollinrake’s letters cap weeks of renewed criticism of Lloyds’ handling of the fraud at HBOS Reading, one of Britain’s worst banking scandals that saw six people jailed for a total of 47 years last year. The recent publication of an internal Lloyds 2013 report into the fraud has raised questions of a cover up. Meanwhile, regulatory and law enforcement agencies are still conducting probes into what happened. Lloyds has also commissioned a retired judge to examine whether Lloyds properly investigated the incident after it brought HBOS in 2009. “We are determined to get to the bottom of what happened in HBOS Reading,” the Lloyds spokeswoman said. The fraud targeted small businesses in the bank’s impaired assets division, which were loaded up with unmanageable debt and stripped of their assets when they were unable to pay. But in his letter to regulator the Financial Conduct Authority, Hollinrake said the APPG’s concerns “relate not to past misconduct, but current treatment of victims of a proven fraud”. He pointed to the senior managers’ regime, which aims to make executives at financial firms more accountable, and called on the watchdog to say what powers it had to rectify the problems he had outlined. These included, he said, the bank attacking victims’ character, refusing to discuss the methodology used to calculate its offers or otherwise justify its decisions and abusing its resource power by refusing to make interim payments for legal representation. Lloyds’ statement did not address the specific concerns Hollinrake raised."

-11.676673193906554," UPDATE 4-Spain's Sabadell counts cost of TSB IT failure * TSB-related costs more than double initial estimate * TSB CEO says could take months to restore all services * Sabadell shares fall more than 5 percent (Adds Sabadell CFO comments, details) MADRID/LONDON, July 27 (Reuters) - An IT failure at Britain’s TSB has cost parent Banco Sabadell more than 200 million euros ($233 million), pushing the Spanish bank to a quarterly loss, with its effects to be felt for the rest of the year. A botched migration of TSB computer systems in April saw thousands of users locked out of their accounts and a surge in attacks by fraudsters, prompting a regulatory investigation and criticism of its chief executive. Sabadell, which bought TSB in 2015, booked an extraordinary charge of 203 million euros for the outage, including compensation for cases of alleged fraud during the migration and 92.4 million euros for future customer claims. Sabadell had estimated the cost at around 70 million pounds ($91.7 million) in a statement last month. The lender’s Chief Financial Officer Tomas Varela told analysts on a conference call that the cost figure did not include any provisions for fines TSB could be hit with as a result of the outage. “It is still very early stages to form an opinion on whether fines are likely or not,” Varela said. Sabadell shares fell around 6 percent to 1.34 euros on the Madrid stock exchange by 0830 GMT after it reported a loss of 138.7 million euros for the second quarter. TSB Chief Executive Paul Pester told Reuters he expected everything to be back to normal in terms of serving existing customers and attracting new ones by the first quarter of 2019. Some services for new customers are currently limited while the bank ensures it serves its 5 million existing customers as usual. Pester said he planned to stay at the bank despite criticism from lawmakers and a backlash from customers hit by the failure. The bank’s handling of the crisis has tarnished its reputation just as it tried to win more market share in Britain and offset a squeeze in margins in its Spanish home market as a result of ultra low interest rates in the euro zone. TSB reported a pre-tax loss of 107.4 million pounds. Around 80 percent of the additional costs booked in the first half of the year are not expected to recur, TSB’s Chief Financial Officer Ralph Coates said. The bank said additional costs will mainly be due to paying extra resources added to cope with the crisis, including 1,800 new staff, rather than compensation claims for customers, fraud or lost profits from waived fees. CFO Varela said management aimed to reduce ongoing running costs, initially anticipated at 7 million euros per month, over time. Sabadell did not see any costs running into 2019, he added. Sabadell expects to retain most of its customers, with the platform improving quickly, he said. TSB said about 26,000 customers had switched their accounts away from the bank in the second quarter of the year, but 20,000 people had opened accounts with the bank. Of the 135,403 complaints it has so far received since the migration, 37 percent were resolved, it said. Sabadell’s net interest income, or profit from loans minus funding costs, fell 7.8 percent in the quarter from the same period last year to 899 million euros, also hit by TSB. Analysts were mixed on the results. Mirabaud and Goldman Sachs said the bank had now drawn a line under the main risks looming over its balance sheet, including TSB and non performing real estate assets. But RBC Capital Markets noted the impact of the outage would still be felt going into 2019. At group level, earnings were also impacted by several one-offs linked to the disposal of Italian bonds, a debt impairment at Spain’s bad bank and charges linked to the sale of bad property assets.

-6.8050966904590044," Exclusive: Lloyds Bank plans three EU subsidiaries after Brexit - sources LONDON (Reuters) - Lloyds Banking Group plans to operate three subsidiaries in continental Europe after Britain leaves the EU, according to a source familiar with the matter, in a sign of how Brexit is fragmenting a banking industry long concentrated in London. Lloyds LLOY.L, Britain's biggest mortgage lender, was widely expected to manage its continental business from one new subsidiary in Berlin. But executives now plan two further hubs to service customers across the European Union, the source told Reuters. One is likely to be in Frankfurt and the location of the second is yet to be confirmed, the person said. The plans by Lloyds - an institution more than 250 years old that has always concentrated its operations in Britain - shows how Brexit is forcing banks to upend history and business models to guarantee they can continue selling their products in Europe. They are part of a wider trend that is seeing lenders distribute their post-Brexit resources among a number of cities on the continent rather than basing the bulk of operations in one place as they have for decades in London. Swiss bank UBS UBSG.S said in March it would pursue a ""decentralized"" model, in line with moves by Goldman Sachs GS.N, Bank of America BAC.N and JPMorgan JPM.N. Such plans will incur greater costs and complexity, as each subsidiary needs to be capitalized and licensed by regulators. They run counter to the expectations among many executives and analysts, following Britain’s 2016 vote to leave the EU, that banks would each choose one main continental hub to replace London, with Frankfurt, Paris and Dublin the frontrunners. A spokesman for Lloyds declined to comment. Earlier this year, separate sources told Reuters that Lloyds would house its main European subsidiary in Berlin, after converting an existing Bank of Scotland branch that Lloyds inherited following the HBOS takeover a decade ago. The plan to run three continental units has partly been prompted by new British regulations that have already forced UK banks to carve up balance sheets into individually capitalized “ringfenced” and “non-ringfenced” entities ahead of a January 2019 deadline. The rules are aimed at insulating bank depositors from riskier trading activities and protecting taxpayers from having to backstop troubled banks once deemed “too big to fail”. To comply with the rules following Brexit, Lloyds needs a second subsidiary to support its non-ringfenced euro bond trading business, the source said. That subsidiary is likely to be set up in Frankfurt, the source said, which is home to Europe’s biggest euro bond trading market outside London and offers the bank the best chance of running a smooth service to clients following Britain’s expected exit from the EU single market on March 29 next year. The Frankfurt subsidiary will not need a full banking license but Lloyds has applied to Germany’s financial markets regulator for the requisite investment firm license, the source added. Lloyds is also seeking to establish a third subsidiary in an as yet unconfirmed location to support its Scottish Widows “closed-book” insurance business, which include premium-paying policies from customers based across the European Union. All three subsidiaries will need to be capitalized individually, the source said, but the total pool of capital needed is not expected to be large compared with the size of the group’s overall balance sheet. Earlier this year, Reuters reported the ultimate size of the pool of capital carved out to capitalize the Berlin subsidiary was expected to run to the “low hundreds of millions of pounds”, representing less than 1 percent of the bank’s overall capital. Lloyds already employs around 300 people in Berlin, including a full management team, finance, risk and human resources staff. It expects to shift no more than a handful of staff from Britain to complement the existing workforce, the source said."
-8.260863555402862," Sainsbury's defends new chairman from criticism over Lloyds role LONDON (Reuters) - Sainsbury's SBRY.L, the British grocer that has agreed to buy rival Asda, has defended its new chairman, dismissing a shareholder's suggestion that he might be tainted by a failed takeover deal during his time at Lloyds Banking Group LLOY.L. Britain’s second largest supermarket group said on Wednesday Martin Scicluna would join its board as chairman-designate on Nov. 1 and succeed David Tyler as non-executive chairman in March 2019 or soon after. Tyler has held the role since 2009. Scicluna is currently the chairman of RSA Insurance RSA.L and property firm Great Portland Estates GPOR.L. His previous roles include being a non-executive director and chair of the audit committee at Lloyds Banking Group. He was at Lloyds when the bank bought struggling peer HBOS during the financial crisis in 2008. The government-brokered takeover, which saved HBOS from a state bailout, valued the bank at around 5.9 billion pounds ($7.8 billion) and wiped billions off Lloyds’ market value. Lloyds itself then had to be rescued with a 20.5 billion-pound bailout in 2009. Scicluna's time at Lloyds prompted one private shareholder at Sainsbury's annual general meeting in central London to question his suitability to lead the retailer's board and its 7.3 billion pounds takeover of Walmart-owned WMT.N Asda. “My concern at the moment is a lack of diligence in 2008 by a number of individuals. I don’t want to have a similar thing occurring in 2019 when we merge with Asda,” said Ralph Eschwege. Susan Rice, Sainsbury’s senior independent director who led the search for the firm’s new chairman, told investors his concern was unfounded. “He (Scicluna) came on to that board (Lloyds) probably days after the terms of the (HBOS) deal had been arranged,” she said. “He was certainly on the board during that period. That was a very complicated period and the coming together of Lloyds and HBOS couldn’t be more different than the transaction that we’re looking at just now. “I personally see absolutely no relation or overlap there.” Rice, who was managing director of Lloyds Banking Group Scotland at the same time Scicluna was at the group, said Sainsbury’s had done “extensive due diligence” on every stage of Scicluna’s career. “He shares the values that we all share here at Sainsbury’s. I think with his experience and with who he is, he will be a very positive force for this transaction,” she said. In April, Sainsbury's agreed to buy Asda, Britain's No. 3 grocery player, a combination that will overtake Tesco TSCO.L as Britain's biggest supermarket chain. The deal is being assessed by Britain’s regulator, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA). The CMA’s probe is expected to be lengthy and Sainsbury’s does not anticipate the deal being concluded until the second half of 2019. On appointment, Scicluna’s pay will be 237,500 pounds a year as chairman designate and 475,000 a year as chairman. Shares in Sainsbury’s, up 36 percent this year on the back of the Asda deal, were down 0.1 percent at 329.4 pence at 1532 GMT, valuing the business at 7.2 billion pounds."

Bester will replace Liam Coleman, who announced his resignation in June after less than 18 months in the job, having overseen the bank’s restructuring and recapitalisation. Co-op Bank needed to be rescued after its capital base dipped to levels unacceptable to Britain’s financial regulators as it grappled with restructuring costs and weak income. Bester was group director and chief executive of the commercial banking division at Lloyds, leading the transformation of that business since 2012, Co-op Bank said in a statement. Co-op Bank Chairman Bob Dench said Bester was the right person to take the lender forward as it focuses on becoming a “sustainable profitable bank”. “He is a first class business leader with the experience, drive and intellect required to lead the organisation forward at a key point in its turnaround journey,” Dench said. Bester will take up a post on the board from Monday to begin the transition of responsibilities from Coleman. “Over its recent history, the bank has been through a period of great change and uncertainty and I look forward to working with the teams to return the business to its former strength,” Bester said in a statement.

-8.200239923083284," Britain's Lloyds offers $100 million so far to HBOS fraud victims LONDON(Reuters) - Lloyds Banking Group LLOY.L has made compensation offers worth 76 million pounds ($100.46 million) to victims of a fraud at its HBOS Reading unit, lawmakers said on Thursday. 170 former directors of companies impacted by the fraud have so far been offered compensation, of whom 134 have accepted, Russel Griggs, who is overseeing the bank’s compensation process, said in a letter published by lawmakers on Thursday. Six people including two former HBOS bankers were jailed last year for a combined 47 years for their role in the fraud, in which the conspirators enriched themselves at the expense of the bank’s business clients. The compensation shows how Lloyds is still suffering from past misconduct, a decade on from the financial crisis and as its Chief Executive Antonio Horta-Osorio attempts to turn investors and customers’ focus from past misdeeds to the bank’s new strategy. “The fraud at HBOS Reading was a shocking crime that destroyed lives and livelihoods,” Nicky Morgan, chair of the cross-party Treasury Committee, said on Thursday. Morgan also called on Linda Dobbs, the retired judge probing whether Lloyds properly investigated the incident after it brought HBOS in 2009, to speed up her inquiry after Dobbs said it would likely take until the end of 2019 to complete. Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is separately conducting a probe into HBOS and what its executives knew of the fraud. The Griggs review has identified a total of 187 individual former directors of companies affected by the HBOS Reading fraud, the letters published on Thursday show, meaning the final compensation figure is likely to be higher as those remaining are made offers."
-8.200239923083284," Britain's anti-fraud body closes investigation into rate rigging at Lloyds LONDON, July 4 (Reuters) - More than a dozen employees at Lloyds Banking Group will be spared criminal trial for their part in the alleged rigging of the Libor benchmark, after Britain’s Serious Fraud Office (SFO) closed its investigation due to lack of evidence. “Having thoroughly investigated and having reviewed the information available to it, the SFO has concluded there was insufficient evidence to take the matter further in respect of these individuals and banks,” the SFO said in a statement on Wednesday. The prosecutor, which tackles cases of high-level fraud and corruption in British business, said it had written to the banks and the individuals involved to tell them they were no longer suspects. It has also contacted witnesses to inform them of its decision to close the probe. Lloyds declined to comment. The lender paid 218 million pounds ($287.98 million) in 2014 to settle allegations that some of its staff colluded to set the London interbank offered rate (Libor), against which rates on hundreds of trillions of dollars worth of contracts and loans are set across the world. Some of the world’s most powerful financial institutions have paid around $9 billion to settle allegations of rate rigging. Deutsche Bank paid $2.5 billion in 2015 while Barclays paid $453 million in 2012. The SFO declined to give details on the number of suspects subject to the criminal investigation but at the time of the bank’s 2014 settlement, Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority had said 16 individuals at Lloyds, seven of them managers, were directly involved in or aware of the various forms of Libor manipulation. The FCA also found that staff employed by Bank of Scotland, which Lloyds later acquired, manipulated Libor submissions to avoid negative media comment and alter market perceptions of its financial strength. Lloyds was rescued by a 20.5-billion-pound government bailout during the financial crisis but returned to full private ownership last year.

-3.367514415605167," British politicians step up pressure on Lloyds Bank over HBOS fraud LONDON (Reuters) - Lloyds Banking Group LLOY.L is facing more pressure over its handling of a fraud at its HBOS Reading business that took place more than a decade ago, with the chair of Britain's Treasury Committee calling for ""maximum transparency"" over the affair. The intervention by committee chair Nicky Morgan follows the publication of an internal 2013 Lloyds report last week, which alleges serious misconduct by the bank over its handling and disclosure of the fraud. Morgan, who described the report’s allegations as “deeply troubling”, has written to fellow member of parliament Kevin Hollinrake, saying the committee had taken a close interest in the case and could “engage constructively” with it once investigations into the matter have been completed. “It is then that we will have more clarity on who knew what, and when,” she wrote, adding that she would press for speedy conclusions to the investigations and that specific allegations could then be put to the bank. Morgan’s intervention turns up the heat on Lloyds and regulators over the fraud, one of Britain’s worst-ever banking scandals for which six people were jailed for a total of 47 years last year. A Lloyds spokesman said on Wednesday the bank supported the investigations into the fraud, welcomed Morgan’s statement and would assist the committee in its consideration of the matter. “Lloyds Banking Group remains determined to get to the bottom of what happened in HBOS Reading and we share the Treasury Committee’s desire for transparency,” the spokesman said in a statement. A cross-party group of lawmakers, headed by Hollinrake, last week called for “full, forensic and expeditious” investigations by regulators and law enforcement agencies into the report’s allegations. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is conducting a probe into HBOS and what its executives knew of the fraud, while a retired judge Linda Dobbs is looking at whether Lloyds properly investigated the incident after it brought HBOS in 2009. Britain’s National Crime Agency has also expanded a review into the fraud. The fraud, which took place in the early 2000s, enabled the conspirators to enrich themselves at the expense of the bank’s business clients. Morgan has also written to Dobbs to ask when her Lloyds-commissioned review into the matter would be complete. Morgan also said the committee would expect to see her full, unredacted findings in the same form as they are presented to the FCA. The allegations in the Lloyds’ internal report could have far-reaching implications given Lloyds’ takeover of HBOS in 2009. Written by a former Lloyds manager, the report says that had HBOS properly disclosed the fraud in 2007, a 4 billion pound ($5.30 billion) 2008 rights issue that stabilized its financial position, and its subsequent takeover by Lloyds, would not have happened. The report has circulated privately among regulators and law enforcement officials for years but has not been made available to the public. Scottish businessman Neil Mitchell, a critic of Britain’s big banks, published the report online last week, saying it was in the public interest. Morgan has also written to Russel Griggs, an independent professor appointed by Lloyds to manage a compensation scheme for the victims of the fraud, asking for details on his progress on settling victims claims. “It is overwhelmingly in the public interest to understand how such a huge criminal fraud was allowed to happen, and why it took so long to come to light,” she said in a statement.

-0.8971837493928005," British lawmakers call for probe of Lloyds, KPMG over HBOS fraud (Reuters) - A group of British lawmakers on Thursday called for an investigation by law enforcement and regulatory agencies into the handling by Lloyds Banking Group LLOY.L of a fraud at its HBOS Reading unit more than a decade ago and into the role of auditor KPMG. The call by the All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Fair Business Banking comes after the publication online on Tuesday of an internal 2013 report alleging serious misconduct by the lender over the handling and disclosure of the fraud. The lawmakers said allegations that HBOS had concealed the fraud, one of Britain’s worst-ever banking scandals that saw six people jailed for a total of 47 years last year, should be subject to “full, forensic and expeditious investigations by regulators”. A Lloyds spokeswoman reiterated the bank’s statement on Tuesday that the internal 2013 report had been provided to Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and to the police in 2014. “We strongly refute the allegations with regards to KPMG’s knowledge and involvement in the report, which we believe to have no basis in fact,” a KPMG spokesperson said in an emailed statement to Reuters. “We have cooperated fully with the detailed investigations undertaken, including those by the PRA / FCA and the FRC (watchdogs), none of which concluded that our work did not meet the applicable audit standards of the time.” The internal report published on Tuesday by Scottish businessman Neil Mitchell, a frequent critic of Britain’s big banks, alleged that HBOS executives knew of the fraud as early as 2004 and failed to properly disclose it, with far-reaching implications given Lloyds’ takeover of HBOS in 2009. In its statement on Tuesday, Lloyds did not address the substance of the report’s allegations that it misled investors over its financial health by not disclosing the fraud earlier. Britain’s financial watchdog is conducting a probe into HBOS and what its executives knew of the fraud, while a retired judge is probing whether Lloyds then properly investigated the incident after it brought HBOS in 2009. The report, written in 2013 by a former manager at the bank after she had taken her concerns to the police, stated that Lloyds mishandled its investigation and disclosure of the fraud after it took over HBOS in 2009. Lloyds said on Tuesday that the former manager began looking into the bank’s handling of the fraud case on her own initiative, and was then asked to write the report when she alerted the bank’s audit department. The report said that if HBOS had properly disclosed the fraud in its 2007 annual report, the 4 billion pound ($5.3 billion) 2008 rights issue that stabilized its financial position and its subsequent takeover by Lloyds would not have happened. Lawmakers last week urged Lloyds to publish the report, which the bank had declined to do on the grounds it contained sensitive information about its customers. Neil Mitchell said publishing it was in the public interest. The APPG also published the report on Thursday. It said it would press for a new investigation into KPMG’s audit of HBOS in 2008, which it said “gave the bank a clean bill of health only two months before it hit financial difficulty.”"

-0.30977047869682356," Report claims Britain's Lloyds misled investors over HBOS fraud LONDON (Reuters) - An internal Lloyds Banking Group LLOY.L report written by a former manager at the bank and published on Tuesday alleges serious misconduct by the lender over the handling and disclosure of a fraud at its HBOS Reading unit. The report, written in 2013 after the Lloyds manager had taken her concerns to the police, alleges HBOS executives knew of the fraud as early as 2004 and failed to properly disclose it, with far-reaching implications given Lloyds’ takeover of HBOS in 2009. It also states Lloyds mishandled its investigation and disclosure of the fraud following that takeover. “This report was provided to the FCA and the police at the time, in 2014,” a spokesman for Lloyds said, referring to the regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). The former Lloyds manager began looking into the bank’s handling of the fraud case on her own initiative, and was then asked to write the report when she alerted the bank’s Audit department, the Lloyds spokesman said. Lloyds did not in its statement address the substance of the report’s allegations that it misled investors over its financial health by not disclosing the fraud earlier. Lawmakers last week urged Lloyds to publish the report, which the bank had declined to do on the grounds it contained sensitive information about its customers. Scottish businessman Neil Mitchell, a frequent critic of Britain’s big banks, published the report online on Tuesday, saying it was in the public interest. The report has circulated privately among regulators and law enforcement officials for years but has not been made available to the public. Six people including two former HBOS bankers were jailed last year for a combined 47 years for their role in the fraud, in which the conspirators enriched themselves at the expense of the bank’s business clients. The report says that if HBOS had properly disclosed the fraud in its 2007 annual report, the 4 billion pound ($5.3 billion) 2008 rights issue that stabilized its precarious financial position, and its subsequent takeover by Lloyds, would not have happened. Its publication comes at a sensitive time for Lloyds as it attempts to move past a painful legacy of missteps before and during the financial crisis. That process has been complicated by ongoing scrutiny of the bank’s handling of the HBOS fraud. Britain’s financial watchdog is conducting a probe into HBOS and what its executives knew of the fraud, while a retired judge is probing whether Lloyds then properly investigated the incident after it bought HBOS in 2009. That report will likely not be published until late next year at the earliest, Reuters reported in May. Britain’s National Crime Agency has also widened a review into the fraud at HBOS to look into allegations that fell outside of the initial criminal investigation."
-6.953897697428937," British lawmakers threaten publication of report on fraud at Lloyds unit LONDON, June 14 (Reuters) - A group of British lawmakers said they will publish a report into what Lloyds Banking Group knew about a fraud at its HBOS Reading unit, following years of campaigns for full disclosure by its victims. The fraud was one of Britain’s worst-ever banking scandals and the report claims that HBOS in 2008 concealed the fraud in an attempt to prevent the failure of a rights issue and its subsequent takeover by Lloyds during the financial crisis. Kevin Hollinrake, chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Fair Business Banking, said the cross-party group would use public interest laws to publish the so-called ‘Project Lord Turnbull Report’, unless Lloyds itself publishes first. Six people including two former HBOS bankers were jailed last year for a combined 47 years for their role in the fraud, in which the conspirators enriched themselves at the expense of the bank’s business clients. The report, written by a Lloyds employee in 2013, has circulated privately among relevant stakeholders for years but has not been made available to the public because of the sensitive customer data contained in it. Publication is likely to raise further questions over the timing of Lloyds and HBOS’s disclosures about the fraud, a matter of public interest, Hollinrake said in a letter addressed to Lloyds’ Chief Executive Antonio Horta-Osorio dated June 13 and seen by Reuters. A spokesman for Lloyds declined to comment. The bank has previously said that it handed the report to regulators and the police as soon as it was completed. The threatened publication of the report comes at a sensitive time for Lloyds, as it attempts to move past a painful legacy of missteps before and during the financial crisis. That process has been complicated by ongoing scrutiny of the bank’s handling of the HBOS fraud.

-9.718041196719392," UK lawmakers have 'lost confidence' in TSB boss over IT crisis LONDON (Reuters) - The chairman of TSB said on Thursday the bank’s chief executive, Paul Pester, had the full support of the board, after Pester came under attack from lawmakers over his handling of an IT crisis, casting doubt on his position. Parliament’s Treasury Committee said earlier on Thursday it had “lost confidence” in Pester and questioned whether he should remain in his post. The IT outage left thousands of customers without access to accounts and unable to make vital payments. TSB Chairman Richard Meddings’ response suggested Pester would remain at the bank for now, noting Pester’s progress in resolving the IT issues. “This progress has been achieved under the leadership of Paul Pester, who continues to have the full support of the TSB Board,” Meddings said in a statement on Thursday evening. The politicians cannot directly influence whether Pester is sacked. That decision rests with the bank’s board. In letters to Meddings, the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority, the chair of the Treasury Committee, Nicky Morgan, said the committee was expressing no opinion on who was responsible for the IT crisis but on Pester’s response afterwards. “Since the IT problems at TSB began, its public communications have often been complacent and misleading. This tone has been set from the top,” Morgan said in a statement. In her letter to Meddings, Morgan listed instances where the TSB boss had either omitted information or made statements the committee deemed inaccurate, and did not take opportunities to correct his statements. “Whether intentionally or not, he has not been straight with the committee and ... TSB’s customers,” she said. Treasury Committee members called such public criticism of a serving bank CEO “unprecedented”. The PRA and FCA declined to comment. “I have never seen such unanimity in the Committee. Each and everyone came to the same conclusion,” said Labour party lawmaker and committee member John Mann on Twitter. TSB’s Spanish owner, Sabadell, said earlier on Thursday the crisis had so far cost about 70 million pounds ($94 million), mainly from a waiver of overdraft fees and compensation for cases of alleged fraud linked to the IT problems. Sabadell declined to comment on the lawmakers’ criticisms of Pester. In his second appearance in front of the committee on Wednesday, Pester was forced by one lawmaker to admit he had been unaware of serious problems with the bank’s fraud helpline during his first appearance, where he said most issues had been resolved."
-9.718041196719392," IT failures at British bank TSB cost $94 million so far, owner Sabadell says MADRID (Reuters) - Information technology failures at British bank TSB have cost around 70 million pounds ($93.95 million) so far, its Spanish parent Sabadell said on Thursday. A botched migration of TSB computer systems last month saw thousands of users locked out of their accounts and a surge in attacks by fraudsters, prompting a regulatory investigation and criticism of its chief executive. Sabadell, which bought TSB in 2015, said in a filing to Spain’s market regulator that the declared cost did not take into account the ongoing investigation. The amount includes costs related to a temporary waiver of overdraft fees and compensation for cases of alleged fraud linked to the migration, Sabadell said in the filing. It also takes into account the cost of paying employees overtime and bringing in additional staff and expert consultants to tackle the situation. There have been 2,200 fraud attempts linked to the snarl and around 1,300 customers have lost money, TSB Chief Executive Paul Pester told British lawmakers on Wednesday. TSB called in International Business Machines Corp to help resolve the crisis, which left some customers waiting for hours in vain on helplines."

-4.21723803671537," Finance watchdog to investigate British bank TSB over IT outage LONDON (Reuters) - British politicians on Wednesday criticised TSB boss Paul Pester for his handling of the bank’s ongoing IT problems and said the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) was looking into the group’s response to the outage last month. TSB, bought in 2015 by Spanish bank Sabadell, had a major IT problem that followed a botched migration of its computer systems to a new platform developed by its Spanish parent. TSB has since made overly optimistic claims about how many customers were affected and has done a poor job of communicating with customers, the FCA’s Chief Executive Andrew Bailey wrote in a letter to members of the Treasury Select Committee made public on Wednesday. Nicky Morgan, chair of the Committee, said: “I am deeply concerned by TSB’s poor communications about the scale and nature of the problems it has faced; by its response to customer fraud; and by the quality and accuracy of the oral and written evidence provided by Dr Pester.” Pester is due to testify before the Treasury committee later on Wednesday about how the bank is handling the crisis, which has left thousands of customers unable to make vital payments, while others have had accounts emptied by fraudsters taking advantage of the disarray. “We continue to focus on doing whatever it takes to put things right for our customers, and ensuring that no customer will be left out of pocket as a result of the recent IT issues,” a spokeswoman for TSB said ahead of Wednesday’s hearing. Pester, a former management consultant with a degree in theoretical physics from Oxford University, previously worked at Lloyds Banking Group on a project to separate TSB from its previous owner Lloyds in 2014. He was criticised by members of the Treasury Committee when he first appeared before them on May 2. Their renewed questioning of his handling of the crisis on Wednesday could raise questions about whether he can remain at the helm of the bank. The FCA’s letter, dated May 30, said a “significant number” of TSB customers had experienced serious problems, including loss of access to their accounts, long wait times on calls to customer helplines, and big queues in branches. The IT disruption has also led to a spike in customers being hit by fraud, and the bank has failed to meet regulations requiring immediate refunds for such victims, the regulator said. Rushed testing and poor communication played a role in the eventual failure of the software upgrade, Reuters reported last month."
-9.678481742209057," Investors attack Britain's Lloyds Bank over mistreatment of customers LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Lloyds Banking Group LLOY.L faced a barrage of allegations of poor customer service and withholding misconduct compensation on Thursday, laying bare the task of rebuilding customer trust after years of reputational damage. Shareholders of the UK’s biggest commercial and retail lender were quick to go on the attack at the bank’s annual general meeting, venting their anger over issues from fraud to the mistreatment of small businesses and the rates it charges “vulnerable” mortgage borrowers. “You’re a liar and a cheat,” one shareholder shouted at Lloyds’ Chairman Norman Blackwell at the start of the meeting, setting the tone for a series of predominantly hostile confrontations between management and investors. A little more than a year since its return to private ownership after the British government finished selling the stake it assumed following its 2008 bailout, Lloyds has completed a restructuring of its business but is still struggling to restore its reputation. The hardest-hitting questions posed by investors concerned the fallout from one of Britain’s worst banking frauds at the Reading branch of Lloyds’ HBOS unit, an independent review into which has slipped into 2019. Six people, including two former HBOS bankers, were jailed last year for the fraud and the bank is still being investigated by Britain’s National Crime Agency. Shareholders grilling Lloyds about the case included British entertainer and television presenter Noel Edmonds, who said the bank had reneged on promises to pay consequential losses to affected customers over and above any compensation due. Edmonds has been a vocal critic of Lloyds ever since the collapse of his company, Unique Group, which he alleged was “groomed, pillaged and destroyed” by the bank, leading to scores of job losses. ‘DARK FORCES’ “Your brand values are trashed, the black horse has become a symbol of the dark forces in banking,” Edmonds said. “You boasted about a landmark year, some might say it’s been more like a skidmark year.” Lloyds has apologised to the victims of the HBOS Reading fraud and set aside 100 million pounds ($134 million) for compensation. Further complaints came from customers who said they were paying more than they should for mortgages on so-called standard variable rates, to which homebuyers are often switched from cheaper initial rates. Britain’s financial watchdog this month said that about 30,000 borrowers in Britain who took out home loans before the 2008 crisis were now mortgage “prisoners”, blocked from switching to better rates by the terms of their deals. Shareholder Lisa King said she could have saved 500 pounds a month by switching, had she not been prevented from doing so by the bank, and that she and her husband have suffered “five years of living hell” as a result of the financial burden. Blackwell said he was not familiar with her case but would ensure it was investigated. He also invited aggrieved customers to begin legal proceedings against Lloyds if they felt that their complaints had not been handled to their satisfaction. However, not all attendees were there to berate the board. Alexander Hopkinson-Woolley said that Chief Executive Antonio Horta-Osorio deserved “a dukedom” for his efforts in rehabilitating Lloyds after the almost fatal government-backed acquisition of troubled lender HBOS at the peak of the financial crisis.

-11.9089925014012," Lloyds sells Irish mortgage business to Barclays for 4 billion pounds LONDON (Reuters) - Lloyds Banking Group LLOY.L has sold its Irish residential mortgage portfolio to Barclays BARC.L for around 4 billion pounds ($5.4 billion) in cash, as part of a plan to focus on its core British market. The deal was the last action Lloyds needed to take to complete its exit from the Irish market, following its closure of its retail banking operation there in 2010. Lloyds is left only with around 4 billion pounds worth of additional Irish mortgages that it will allow to expire over time. Lloyds will now be able to focus on tackling an increasing threat to its dominant position in the British markets from new entrants eager to cut prices to win business. Of the assets sold on Friday, 300 million pounds worth are impaired -- meaning borrowers are struggling to pay them. They generated a pretax loss of around 40 million pounds last year, Lloyds said in a statement. A year to the day after its return to private ownership following the British government’s last sale of its stake in Lloyds, Britain’s biggest lender faces a battle to maintain its grip on the mortgage market. Lloyds shares have fallen 7.6 percent in its first year free from government ownership after a bailout. That makes them the worst-performing stock among Britain’s four biggest banks with rivals RBS and HSBC climbing an average of 10 percent in the same period. Investors fear that Lloyds as the biggest mortgage lender, with a market share of 20 percent, has most to fear from a low interest rate environment that makes finding profitable lending opportunities for banks difficult. “We are concerned about the competition from the mortgage market from new entrants. We think Lloyds has the most to lose; it has the biggest share of the market,” said a U.S.-based hedge fund manager with about $1.2 billion in assets. The fund manager is shorting Lloyds shares, meaning he will profit if the stock declines. The threat to Lloyds' position comes not just from so-called challenger mid-sized banks like Virgin Money VM.L, CYBG CYBGC.L and Metro Bank MTRO.L, but also from HSBC HSBA.L which has to grow its market share to meet profit goals in its newly separated UK banking unit. The rules designed after the financial crisis to partition British banks’ core domestic deposit and savings franchises from their riskier and more internationally-focused investment banking units, have effectively created ‘new’ competitors in the market in the form of British-only lenders such as HSBC UK. “I do think that Lloyds have some challenges. Competition is heating up. It’s not just an issue for Lloyds,” said Jerry Del Missier, founding partner and chief investment officer at Copper Street Capital, which has $162 million in assets. “If you think about what’s happening to the UK banking market with ringfencing, you have a number of banks, including challenger banks chasing the same business,” he added."

The investigation by a former high court judge was launched last year to assess whether Lloyds properly investigated and reported the fraud at HBOS, which it bought in January 2009. The review by Linda Dobbs is one of the last high-profile probes into the conduct of Britain’s biggest banks after the 2008 financial crisis, and is eagerly awaited by victims of a fraud which has seen six people jailed for a combined 47 years. HBOS was once Britain’s biggest mortgage lender, and was rescued in a state-engineered takeover by Lloyds, which has apologised to victims of the fraud and set up a 100 million pound ($135 million) compensation scheme. “The Group is determined to get to the bottom of what went on, and a thorough investigation is being conducted,” Lloyds said in an emailed statement on Thursday. Those jailed last February were former HBOS bankers Lynden Scourfield and Mark Dobson, consultant David Mills and his wife Alison, and their associates Michael Bancroft and Tony Cartwright. The fraud involved Scourfield referring struggling businesses which were HBOS clients to Mills’ consultancy, in return for bribes which the judge at their trial said included designer watches, sex with prostitutes and foreign holidays. Dobbs and lawyer Peter Carter have hired 5 more lawyers to handle the paperwork disclosed by Lloyds, which has risen from an initial estimate of 50,000 documents to around 500,000, the source told Reuters. The pair had been hoping to finish the review by the end of this year. The work involves sifting through the documents to build a picture of what Lloyds’ senior executives knew about the fraud, what they did about it and when. Lawmakers have in recent weeks increased scrutiny of Lloyds’ conduct in the years following the crisis, after the leak of an internal report, adding to gathering political concerns over the treatment of small and vulnerable business customers by banks including HBOS. The Turnbull report, which was cited in Parliament by lawmakers, alleges that senior HBOS bankers tried to cover up the fraud and has prompted questions over who within Lloyds had seen it, given the bank said it knew nothing of the fraud until the criminal case last year. The source familiar with the Dobbs review said the Turnbull report was one of the hundreds of thousands of documents received, and that efforts were now being made to establish in what context it was written, who was made aware of it and what was done about it. The Financial Conduct Authority said in April last year it is conducting its own review into the discovery and reporting of the HBOS fraud, focused on the period before its acquisition by Lloyds, whereas the Dobbs review centres on the time afterwards. Britain’s National Crime Agency has also widened a review into the fraud at HBOS to look into allegations that fell outside of the initial criminal investigation.

-8.988757147824888," Standard Life Aberdeen challenges Lloyds Banking Group over axed mandate LONDON (Reuters) - Standard Life Aberdeen (SLA) SLA.L has launched a contract dispute process against Lloyds Banking Group LLOY.L over the lender's decision to cancel a 109 billion pound ($147 billion) asset management contract. Britain’s biggest mortgage lender and parent of pensions provider Scottish Widows, told SLA on Feb. 14 that it intended to cancel the mandate at the end of a 12-month notice period, citing competition concerns following the 11 billion pounds merger of Aberdeen Asset Management and Standard Life. At the time, Lloyds said the combined entity had become a “material competitor” to its wealth and insurance units, and it had started a process to find a new manager for the assets, which mainly comprise of lower margin passive equity and fixed income securities. SLA said on Tuesday it did not agree that it posed a competition threat to its largest client, and the bank therefore had no right to terminate the asset management agreements. It said the two sides were “engaging with each other within the framework of the dispute resolution process” envisaged in the contract, without elaborating. In response, Lloyds said it was “surprised” by SLA’s move and confident in its legal right to terminate the agreement. “We note and are disappointed by the comments made by Standard Life Aberdeen, particularly in the light of our position as a major customer,” Lloyds said in a statement, adding the contract to manage the assets would have ended “in any event” in March 2022. “Standard Life Aberdeen is a clear and material competitor of Scottish Widows and Lloyds Banking Group in the UK and to suggest otherwise is not credible.” Shares in the asset manager were trading 0.2 percent down at 361.4 pence by 0956 GMT, while Lloyds stock was up 0.4 percent. The annual revenue associated with the asset management contracts represents around 130 million pounds or 4.4 percent of SLA’s full year 2017 pro forma revenue. SLA said it would provide a further update in due course. Clients have pulled billions of pounds in assets in the nine months since the union forged one of Europe’s biggest asset managers.

Pester and Meddings apologized to members of Britain’s Treasury Committee on Wednesday for the migration over the weekend of April 21-22 that left up to 1.9 million customers unable to access their accounts. Customers were still complaining on Wednesday, more than a week later, as one of Britain’s worst-ever bank computer system outages continued. Pester said that 95 percent of attempted logins to the bank’s mobile and digital platforms were now successful, but apologized when members the Treasury Committee confronted him with new complaints from customers about continued problems. Meddings said that neither he nor Pester would leave the bank over the crisis. Both men were criticized repeatedly by the politicians on the committee for their attitude during the hearing, in which they insisted that the “underlying engine” of the bank was working well. “What we are hearing this afternoon is the most staggering example of a chief executive that seems unwilling to realize the scale of the problem,” Conservative member of parliament and chair of the committee Nicky Morgan said. Pester was awarded a bonus worth 1.6 million pounds ($2.18 million) in 2016 linked to the successful completion of the migration, out of a total pay package of 3.7 million pounds, according to the bank’s annual report. It was not immediately clear what the value of the 2017 bonus he was due to receive was, or whether he would forego past awards linked to the migration project. The bank has appointed consulting firm Deloitte to work out a compensation scheme for affected customers, Meddings said. It has also appointed law firm Slaughter and May to investigate what went wrong. “I have given a cast iron guarantee no customers will be left out of pocket,” Pester said. The committee members questioned Pester as to how robust testing of the bank’s systems had been prior to the migration. Reuters reported earlier on Wednesday that rushed testing had contributed to its subsequent failure. Pester said the bank had conducted many tests, but still did not know exactly what had caused the outage.

TSB, bought in 2015 by Spain’s Sabadell Bank from Lloyds Banking Group, was migrating to Sabadell’s in-house developed system, Proteo, from legacy systems for which it had been paying Lloyds around a hundred million pounds a year. TSB customers started reporting problems making bill and mortgage payments within hours of the migration over the weekend of April 21-22. On Tuesday, clients were still complaining on social media. Two IT contractors who managed employees involved in the migration up until late last year told Reuters that testing of the different systems was not as thorough as it could have been at that time because TSB rushed as it neared a self-imposed deadline of November 2017, later extended to April 2018. TSB rejected that view, telling Reuters testing was “extensive”. “There wasn’t time to test everything, digital and mobile payment testing weren’t properly scoped, so it wasn’t a surprise to me when it went live last week and those parts didn’t work,” said one source, a project manager who oversaw people working on the upgrade, referring to the testing up to the first deadline. A second source, a software tester, said tests were in some cases poorly designed or rushed in order to meet the initial project launch date. He also cited a lack of communication between IT and the business about who was managing the testing. “There were multiple daily failures in Proteo that would go on sometimes for five days and a lack of adequate training on Proteo, meaning testing was conducted based on knowledge of the legacy systems,” the tester said. The project manager stopped working for the company when his contract ended in December. The tester left around the same time. Both said they have kept in touch with colleagues still working at the bank and were told the situation had not changed. Reuters contacted several contractors and TSB staff currently working on the project but none were willing to talk. TSB, which has apologised to customers and pledged an investigation, declined to comment on the specific allegations but disputed any shortcomings in its testing. “We are working round the clock to put things right and to keep our customers informed about the latest position. This is our priority at the moment,” it said in a statement to Reuters. “There was extensive testing that was completed before migration. There will of course be an investigation into why the migration did not go as expected.” TSB chief executive Paul Pester and chairman Richard Meddings are due to appear at a parliamentary hearing on Wednesday to explain how the problems occurred and what they are doing to fix them. Banks around the world face the potential for similar crises as they upgrade aging computer systems after decades of under-investment and stitch together different platforms from a wave of mergers. The sources described the Lloyds system as complicated because it was created by amalgamating many systems as Lloyds acquired rivals leading up to the 2008 financial crisis. Banks have been fined in the past for technical problems. The Royal Bank of Scotland was fined 56 million pounds by regulators in 2014 over a botched software upgrade in June 2012 that left millions of customers unable to access accounts.

-4.815855867902434," Rushed testing, poor communication played role in British TSB outage - contractors * Customers still complaining as IT outage enters second week * Testing that might have prevented problems was skipped -insiders * Lawmakers to grill bank executives on Wednesday LONDON, May 1 (Reuters) - A computer systems migration at Britain’s TSB bank that left up to 1.9 million customers unable to access their accounts was hindered by rushed and inadequate testing and poor internal communication, two contractors who worked on the project said. TSB, bought in 2015 by Spain’s Sabadell Bank from Lloyds Banking Group, was migrating to Sabadell’s in-house developed system, Proteo, from legacy systems for which it had been paying Lloyds around a hundred million pounds a year. TSB customers started reporting problems making bill and mortgage payments within hours of the migration over the weekend of April 21-22. On Tuesday, clients were still complaining on social media. Two IT contractors who managed employees involved in the migration up until late last year told Reuters that testing of the different systems was not as thorough as it could have been at that time because TSB rushed as it neared a self-imposed deadline of November 2017, later extended to April 2018. TSB rejected that view, telling Reuters testing was “extensive”. “There wasn’t time to test everything, digital and mobile payment testing weren’t properly scoped, so it wasn’t a surprise to me when it went live last week and those parts didn’t work,” said one source, a project manager who oversaw people working on the upgrade, referring to the testing up to the first deadline. A second source, a software tester, said tests were in some cases poorly designed or rushed in order to meet the initial project launch date. He also cited a lack of communication between IT and the business about who was managing the testing. “There were multiple daily failures in Proteo that would go on sometimes for five days and a lack of adequate training on Proteo, meaning testing was conducted based on knowledge of the legacy systems,” the tester said. The project manager stopped working for the company when his contract ended in December. The tester left around the same time. Both said they have kept in touch with colleagues still working at the bank and were told the situation had not changed. Reuters contacted several contractors and TSB staff currently working on the project but none were willing to talk. TSB, which has apologised to customers and pledged an investigation, declined to comment on the specific allegations but disputed any shortcomings in its testing. “We are working round the clock to put things right and to keep our customers informed about the latest position. This is our priority at the moment,” it said in a statement to Reuters. “There was extensive testing that was completed before migration. There will of course be an investigation into why the migration did not go as expected.” TSB chief executive Paul Pester and chairman Richard Meddings are due to appear at a parliamentary hearing on Wednesday to explain how the problems occurred and what they are doing to fix them. Banks around the world face the potential for similar crises as they upgrade aging computer systems after decades of under-investment and stitch together different platforms from a wave of mergers. The sources described the Lloyds system as complicated because it was created by amalgamating many systems as Lloyds acquired rivals leading up to the 2008 financial crisis. Banks have been fined in the past for technical problems. The Royal Bank of Scotland was fined 56 million pounds by regulators in 2014 over a botched software upgrade in June 2012 that left millions of customers unable to access accounts. TSB said it will cancel overdraft fees for the month of April and increase interest payments to savers as it tries to prevent a customer exodus in the wake of the outage. Sabadell said it is too early to estimate the costs of the incident. It has had to bring in remedial teams from IBM to help try and stem the crisis, while Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority has sent in its own team to investigate. An FCA spokeswoman said: “We are working with the firm to ensure customers are properly communicated with and are not left out of pocket.

-7.282928596962887," Britain's crime agency to expand probe into HBOS fraud allegations LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's National Crime Agency is expanding a review into fraud allegations at HBOS, part of Lloyds Banking Group LLOY.L, that have already led to the jailing of six people in a scam that pushed business owners to hire a costly turnaround consultancy. The NCA said on Monday it was following up a request from Thames Valley police, who conducted the investigation that led to the original convictions, with a view to a wider investigation into allegations of fraud and money laundering. A spokesman for Lloyds said the bank welcomed the fresh review and would cooperate fully. The NCA said its review would look into allegations falling outside the scope of the original investigation, and that it should take six months. The NCA also said the allegations included asset stripping, through the use of corrupt consultants as well as allegations of fraud and money laundering. The sums of money involved could be significant, running to many millions, it said. The Agency said the review would determine whether a full criminal investigation was needed. The initial investigation and prosecution was completed in January 2017 and related to a scam conducted between 2003 to 2008. HBOS became part of Lloyds during the financial crisis. Lloyds has unveiled a 100 million pound compensation scheme for victims of the fraud, who had complained the bank reacted too slowly to their complaints. The six jailed for their involvement in the original scam were sent to prison for a total of 47-and-a-half years, among the toughest sentences handed out for high-profile, white collar fraud in Britain in recent years. The bankers had asked struggling business owners to employ a turnaround consultancy as a condition for getting a loan and they were then obliged to pay the consultancy high fees for services and, in some cases, hand over ownership."
-8.264491417649316," UPDATE 2-Lloyds Bank reassures investors on future of preference shares * Bank has ‘no plans’ to cancel pref shares * Lloyds Q1 profit 1.6 bln stg * Lloyds into second round of bids for former SLA mandate (Recasts, adds preference shares) LONDON, April 25 (Reuters) - Britain’s Lloyds Banking Group said it would not cancel its preference shares following investor complaints about the possibility after insurer Aviva abandoned its plans to scrap the high-yielding shares. George Culmer, the bank’s chief financial officer, provided the reassurance on Wednesday as Lloyds reported first-quarter profits that just missed analysts’ expectations. “Absolutely no discussion on these and absolutely no plans to cancel these irredeemable preference shares through a reduction in capital,” Culmer told a media call. Aviva sparked fears among investors and drew the attention of regulators when it said last month it was considering cancelling the securities, sending preference shares in financial firms plunging. Lloyds reported pre-tax profit of 1.6 billion pounds ($2.2 billion) in the first quarter, just missing analyst expectations of 1.82 billion pounds. While falling short of the average of analysts forecasts based on Thomson Reuters data, the bank’s profits grew by 23 percent compared with the 1.3 billion pounds it posted in the same period last year. “Lloyds has made a good start to 2018,” said Laith Khalaf, senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, adding that the bank is benefiting from rising interest rates and its 2016 acquisition of credit card firm MBNA from Bank of America. But he added while the bank has rebuilt profits and delivered steady returns to investors, share price gains had been more elusive. The bank’s shares were down 0.6 percent at 0715 GMT. Finance director Culmer said the bank is into a second round of bidding for the around 109 billion pound asset management mandate that it withdrew from Standard Life Aberdeen (SLA) in February. The 11 billion pound merger that created SLA triggered the right for Lloyds and Scottish Widows, which is part of the British bank, to review an agreement struck in 2014 for Aberdeen to manage pension assets on behalf of Lloyds’ insurance and wealth units as Standard Life is a “material competitor” to both. “We’ve entered round two now with a more select group of bidders, and what I can say is obviously we’ve not allowed into round two any bidder with whom we have material competition concerns,” Culmer said on Wednesday. Chief Executive Antonio Horta-Osorio said the bank’s first quarter results demonstrated the strength of its business model, and maintained his upbeat tone on the UK economy. “The UK economy continues to be resilient, benefiting from low unemployment and continued GDP growth,” he said, adding the bank had seen no deterioration in asset quality and expected this to continue throughout 2018. Lloyds’ exposure to consumers’ finances via mortgages and unsecured lending like credit cards make it a bellwether for the British economy. While loan impairments rose to 258 million pounds over the first three months of 2018, compared with the 127 million pounds seen in the same period last year, Culmer stressed this was “nothing to do” with a deterioration in the bank’s loan book or the economy. The bank, which laid out a fresh three-year strategy in February, also reported a common equity tier one capital ratio of 14.4 percent and took another 90 million pounds in provisions to resolve issues related to its mis-selling of payment protection insurance.

-13.73732940426213," Lloyds Banking Group to axe 305 jobs and 49 more branches in Britain LONDON (Reuters) - Lloyds Banking Group LLOY.L will cut 305 jobs and close 49 branches in Britain, the latest in a series of reductions to its workforce and network as it promotes its digital services. Lloyds said in February it would invest 3 billion pounds over three years in such digital initiatives, but had not said how many branches or jobs it would axe as part of the cost-cutting strategy. Lloyds said the plan reflected changes in customer behavior, with more people using digital services than branches, which are costly to maintain . “Today’s announcement involves making difficult decisions, and we are committed to working through these changes in a careful and sensitive way,” the bank said in a statement on Tuesday regarding the job losses and closures. The bank said it remained committed to having the largest branch network among banks in Britain, where it operates around one in every five outlets. The latest job losses at Britain’s biggest bank follow an announcement in February that Lloyds cut 465 roles in January. Banks in Britain have between them slashed thousands of branches in recent years to cut costs, drawing criticism from lawmakers who say closures can leave rural communities without a single bank branch. Politicians in June 2016 called the closures a “quiet scandal”, citing a Reuters report showing the closures disproportionately affected poorer areas in Britain. Banks are nonetheless pressing ahead with further cuts, focusing efforts on getting customers to use mobile apps to do the bulk of their transactions and save branch visits for the most complex of their needs."
