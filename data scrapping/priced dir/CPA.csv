-4.657428729477657," United, Avianca and Copa's South American deal delayed as they mull fourth partner BRASILIA (Reuters) - A proposed joint venture between United Airlines, Colombia’s Avianca Holdings and Panama’s Copa Holdings has been delayed due to the potential inclusion of a fourth partner, as well as problems at Avianca, the CEOs of two of the companies said. United Airlines UAL.O said last week it wants to include Brazil's Azul SA AZUL.N, in which it already has a stake, in the planned tie-up with Copa CPA.N and Avianca AVT_p.CN, the latest play by a U.S. carrier for a region expected to have significant air-travel growth in coming decades. The three airlines had said in November 2018 they would file for U.S. antitrust approval “in the near term” in order to coordinate routes between South America and the United States, a bold move to expand their market share in the region. At the time, the carriers said they aimed to implement the agreements in 2020. But almost a year after United, Copa and Avianca announced the preliminary joint venture plan, they have yet to file any paperwork with the U.S. Department of Transportation, seeking antitrust immunity. Now, the regulatory process may begin as late as next year, they said. Copa Chief Executive Officer Pedro Heilbron said the group expects to file in early 2020, while Avianca CEO Anko van der Werff, said it would file between late 2019 and early 2020. Both spoke to Reuters in separate interviews on Monday on the sidelines of the ALTA Airline Leaders’ Forum in Brasilia. Both said there was a delay on the original timeline. United did not comment on a delay but said it planned to complete the application later this year or early next year. Azul had no comment other than saying it was “always looking for opportunities with its partners.” The potential inclusion of Azul, which may be in the early stages of negotiations, has been one reason for the timetable slipping. “Quite frankly, really completely open and honest, we haven’t had many discussions,” van der Werff said. “I personally haven’t had even one real, serious discussion at the CEO level about when to include [Azul] and what to include.” Both executives said they want Azul to be part of the joint venture - Brazil is by far the largest aviation market in the region - but its inclusion makes negotiations more difficult. “It almost doubles the level of complexity,” Heilbron said. Avianca has also gone through corporate turmoil. In May, United Airlines ousted the chairman and controlling shareholder at Avianca, revamping leadership. “We should have filed with regulators this year but everything got delayed because of what has happened at Avianca,” Heilbron added."

-1.232315735710516," United wants Azul in Latin American venture with Copa, Avianca CHICAGO/SAO PAULO (Reuters) - United Airlines UAL.O wants to include Brazil's Azul AZUL.N in its planned tie-up with Copa Holdings CPA.N and Colombia's Avianca Holdings AVT_p.CN to create a four-way partnership in Latin America, a senior executive said on Friday. “Working together gives us a shot at being No. 1 in Latin America. We need partners to do it,” United Chief Operating Officer Andrew Nocella told journalists. United, Avianca and Copa announced last November their intention to create a joint venture for travel between the United States and Latin America. The proposal requires antitrust approval before it can be implemented. When first announced, the partnership did not include trips to and from Brazil. Azul’s participation would expand the venture’s reach to roughly a third of the region’s residents. Azul is Brazil’s No. 3 airline and operates few flights to the United States. But its domestic reach is expansive, including more flights within Latin America’s largest economy than any other airline. Azul is also a natural partner for United, which already owns about 8% of Azul’s non-voting shares. Azul said earlier this month at an event with analysts in the Brazilian city of Campinas that it was interested in joining the partnership with United, but that nothing was certain. Nocella's comments follow surprise news a month ago of a $1.9 billion investment by Delta Air Lines DAL.N in LATAM Airlines Group LTM.SN, firing up competition in South America. That partnership would make Delta and LATAM the leader in Latin America, a market that Chile-based LATAM already dominates on its own."

The Boeing planes have been grounded worldwide since March after two deadly crashes. Copa also said it had not received two new MAX planes in March because of the global grounding. The company made the announcement as part of its quarterly earnings release, in which it reported a net income of $89 million, compared with $136 million a year earlier."

Copa said it would cover the flights the MAX 9 flew with the rest of its fleet and seek to minimize impact on its passengers. (Reporting by Elida Moreno Editing by Dave Graham)"
-3.042941513430381," UPDATE 1-Copa expects Brazil, Argentina air travel markets to remain weak in 2019 (Adds details of results, background) Feb 14 (Reuters) - Panama’s Copa Holdings expects demand for flights in Argentina and Brazil to remain weak in 2019, executives said on Thursday during a presentation on its earnings, which showed its profit in 2018 had slumped 75 percent to $88 million. Copa’s results were significantly affected by a $190 million writeoff as the company decided to phase out its fleet of 19 Embraer planes. The planes will gradually be replaced by Boeing aircraft. Still, even without that charge, profits would have dropped 25 percent in 2018 from a year earlier. Other factors that impacted the results of Copa, which flies only to destinations in the Americas, were high oil prices for much of the year, and weak currencies that plagued Brazil and Argentina, two of the region’s most important markets. Executives said on a conference call with analysts that ticket sales were particularly hard hit in Argentina, where they tumbled 40 percent in 2018 as the South American nation faced a deep recession.

-17.919571594961955," Airline Copa's profit drops 21 percent on Panama-Venezuela spat (Reuters) - Panama-based airline Copa Holdings CPA.N on Wednesday reported net operating income of $49 million, down 21 percent from a year earlier due in part to a diplomatic spat between Panama and Venezuela that temporarily blocked flights to Caracas. Copa’s profit missed an average estimate of $55 million in a Thomson Reuters survey of nine analysts. In March, a Panama government commission named Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro as an individual likely to be involved in money laundering activities, prompting retaliation that halted commercial activity between the two countries for weeks. As a result, Copa canceled some 300 flights in April. “This was a challenging quarter for Copa Holdings,” the airline said in its earnings release, citing the “cancellation of all flights to Venezuela,” which lasted for 90 days. The Venezuelan market can be lucrative for Copa because most other major airlines have stopped flights to Caracas amid a deep economic crisis, including United Airlines UAL.N, Delta Air Lines Inc DAL.N and Avianca Holdings SA AVT_p.CN. The second quarter is often Copa’s weakest. This year, higher oil prices made up a growing share of operating expenses. Fuel costs consumed 30 percent of Copa’s $634 million in revenue this quarter, compared to 22 percent a year earlier."
