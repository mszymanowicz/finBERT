9.189640742443435," UPDATE 1-Manulife says will prioritize organic growth, dividend hikes for C$29 bln excess capital (Adds share prices, background) TORONTO, Feb 11 (Reuters) - Canada’s top insurer Manulife Financial Corp will prioritize organic growth, dividend increases and share buybacks over acquisitions for its C$29 billion ($22.9 billion) of excess capital, its chief executive said on Thursday. “We don’t need M&A to deliver on our medium-term goals of 10% to 12% core earnings per share growth,” CEO Roy Gori said on an analyst call after reporting higher-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings on Wednesday. “When we do deploy capital, for any M&A, we will do that opportunistically ... when we’ve got a high degree of confidence that we can execute against that agenda,” he added. Gori, in an interview on Wednesday, said the company expects Asia to account for half of its core earnings from both insurance and wealth and asset management by 2025, up from 41% in 2020. Smaller rival Sun Life Financial Inc also beat earnings estimates on Wednesday, helped by strong wealth management growth. The chief executives of both companies said they are optimistic about 2021, thanks to the deployment of coronavirus vaccines and the reopening of economies from prolonged lockdowns in many markets, after a challenging 2020 from which they managed to emerge relatively unscathed. The two companies paid out a total of C$590 million in coronavirus-related death claims in 2020. Sun Life executives told analysts on Thursday it was reducing its real estate footprint in Canada and the United States and expects to take a C$40 to C$60 million charge in the first quarter as a result. Shares of Manulife rose 2.1% to C$25.12 in morning trading in Toronto, while Sun Life shares were up 1.2% at C$62.50. Both were on track for their highest close in nearly a year. The Toronto stock benchmark was down 0.15%."

Aviva, under new boss Amanda Blanc, is looking to sell its businesses in continental Europe and Asia, to focus on Britain, Ireland and Canada. Years of share price underperformance in the life and general insurer have irked investors.

ManuLife said in a separate statement it had agreed a 16-year bancassurance partnership with VietinBank, and was buying Aviva Vietnam as part of the deal. Aviva sold a majority holding in its Singapore business in September and last week completed the sale of its Hong Kong joint venture. In Europe, French mutual insurer Macif is stepping up efforts to buy Aviva France, Reuters reported last week.

Canada’s biggest life insurer is focusing on acquisition opportunities in Asia and its wealth and asset management business, which helped drive its better-than-expected performance during the quarter, Chief Executive Roy Gori told Reuters on Wednesday following its results release. Manulife has about C$32 billion ($24 billion) of excess capital it can deploy, he said. “We clearly see Asia as a jewel in the Manulife crown,” Gori said in an interview. The company has “strong capability” in Asia and in wealth and asset management, and sees potential for growth by adding to these areas, he added. In Asia, Manulife would consider acquisitions that would complement its operations in countries where it has a larger presence, as well as those that would help it build scale in smaller markets, he said. Manulife already doubled its market share in Hong Kong in the first half of 2020 from a year earlier, and the business posted third-quarter core earnings growth of 15%, executives said on the call. Manulife shares fell 2% to C$21.00 in morning trading in Toronto, compared with a 0.1% decline in the Toronto Stock Exchange 300 Composite index. They had climbed nearly 19% this month as of Wednesday’s close, versus the benchmark’s 7.3% gain. “The shares are modestly underperforming today following a sharp rise in the shares recently,” Edward Jones analyst James Shanahan said. Despite the earnings beat, Manulife’s core earnings fell 6% from a year ago. And while core earnings per share have dropped 10% this year, executives maintained Manulife’s medium-term growth rate target of 10% to 12% for 2021 and beyond.

20.993552252603216," Manulife profit beats forecasts on growth in Asia, asset management (Reuters) - Manulife Financial Corp MFC.TO on Wednesday said third-quarter core profit declined less than analyts had expected, helped by earnings growth in Asia and asset management, but it warned the COVID-19 pandemic posed risks. Canada’s top life insurer said the environment remains uncertain due to legal and regulatory responses to the resulting economic downturn from the pandemic. “These disruptions, if they continue, could have a significant adverse impact on our global businesses and operations and on our financial results,” Manulife said in a statement. Manulife reported underlying profit, excluding one-time charges, of C$1.45 billion ($1.11 billion), or 73 Canadian cents a share, in the three months through September, down from C$1.53 billion, or 76 cents, a year earlier. Analysts had expected profit of 70 Canadian cents. Higher payouts in its Canadian insurance business and lower new business volumes due to the coronavirus pandemic were offset by factors including growth in in-force business - the business it has on its books - and increased assets in its wealth and asset management unit, the company said. Third-quarter sales fell 2% from a year earlier as the pandemic-driven declines in Hong Kong and the United States failed to offset gains in other areas. Rival Sun Life Financial Inc SLF.TO last week reported better-than-expected third-quarter core earnings, benefiting from new business gains in Asia and growth in income from its asset management unit.

17.1660309992983," Canadian oil producer Whitecap to buy NAL Resources for nearly $119 million (Reuters) - Canadian oil producer Whitecap Resources Inc WCP.TO said on Monday it would buy NAL Resources Ltd, owned by Manulife Financial Corp MFC.TO, for C$155 million ($118.59 million) as it looks to boost its core Alberta and Saskatchewan assets. Whitecap said it would issue 58.3 million of its shares to Manulife in exchange for all the issued and outstanding shares of NAL, which operates in Canada’s Saskatchewan and Alberta. Insurance and financial services provider Manulife will own about 12.5% of the combined company. The deal marks growing interest in mergers among smaller Canadian oil producers to bolster their portfolios, as uncertainty about future oil demand persists. The COVID-19 pandemic destroyed fuel demand and left dozens of energy companies without the prospect of drilling their way out of debt or bankrupt, making consolidations a viable solution for many smaller players. Separately on Monday, Calgary, Alberta based oil and gas company Obsidian Energy Ltd OBE.TO offered two shares for every share of Bonterra Energy Corp BNE.TO.

3.6187922417628506," Canada's Manulife core profit beats expectations, rises on fewer payouts and markets TORONTO (Reuters) - Manulife Financial Corp MFC.TO on Wednesday comfortably beat analyst estimates for second-quarter core profit, which rose from a year earlier due in part to favorable policyholder experience and market impacts. Underlying profit rose to C$1.6 billion ($1.21 billion), or 78 Canadian cents a share, from C$1.45 billion, or 72 cents, a year earlier, Canada’s biggest life insurer said in a statement. That compared with expectations of 62 Canadian cents. Favorable policyholder experience typically results in lower payouts for insurers and includes beneficial mortality trends and fewer claims. Investors and analysts had forecast large drops in profit for Canadian life insurers during the quarter, driven by the pandemic-driven declines in interest rates and the hit to sales from economic shutdowns. Some of that materialized in Manulife’s reported net income, which halved from a year ago to C$727 million, or 35 Canadian cents per share, weighed by lower interest rates and narrowing credit spreads. Annual premium equivalent sales fell 13% during the quarter. Despite the improvement in underlying earnings, growth was capped by the lack of core investment gains - expected due to mark-to-market losses in the prior quarter - and lower new business volumes, Manulife said. U.S. core earnings posted the strongest growth, climbing 32%, while Canada’s rose 10%. Earnings from Asia grew a subdued 1% as fewer claims were offset by a decline in new business due to the pandemic. Even as assets in the global wealth and asset management unit grew nearly 7% from a year ago, core earnings fell 4% due to lower fee revenues and tax benefits. While new business value was affected by the pandemic, “positive momentum” in annual premium equivalent sales in Asia in the final month of the quarter was “encouraging,” Chief Financial Officer Phil Witherington said in the statement."

Manulife last month reported a 40% drop in first-quarter profit. The decline in rates has required Manulife to respond by changing pricing and products and increasing efficiency, in part through increased technology adoption, he said. Manulife has done more to advance digitization in the past five months than in the previous five years, and more than 90% of products can now be sold digitally, Gori said. Gori said Manulife’s operations outside North America, particularly in Asia, have helped cushion some of the impact of low rates. With different Asian markets are at different points on the yield curve, “you start to appreciate the benefits of global diversity,” he said. Gori cautioned that volatility, particularly in equity markets, will continue until a coronavirus vaccine is developed and deployed. Gori also said 90% of Manulife’s employees in China and 50% in Hong Kong have returned to offices. That contrasts with its North American operations, where 98% of staff are still working from home.

Manulife has a 51% interest in the venture, which it entered into with the Chinese state-owned company in 1996. While acquisitions are lower on Manulife’s list of priorities, “if there’s an opportunity to increase the extent of our ownership (in the Sinochem joint venture), we would be happy to do that,” CFO Phil Witherington said at the online Barclays Americas Select Conference. “It’s not something that’s a necessity, but a nice to have,” he said. “It’s a nice way to potentially deploy capital.” In China, where the novel coronavirus emerged earlier than elsewhere in the world, about 80% of Manulife’s workforce is back in offices following lockdowns to curb the virus’ spread, while in Hong Kong, about half have returned, Witherington said. Asia has been the growth engine for Canadian life insurers over several quarters, with the region’s expanding middle class helping them diversify away from the more mature and competitive market at home. Last week, the Toronto-based insurer reported a decline in first-quarter profit, hit by equity market disruptions due to the coronavirus pandemic and lower sales in Japan, although the company did see growth in new business elsewhere in Asia. Witherington said the insurer also benefitted from lower interest rates, which widened the spreads between risk-free rates and yields on its corporate bond holdings, and from currency movements. But “I wouldn’t bank all of those benefits,” Witherington said. “As markets normalize, assuming the external environment and macro conditions improve, I would expect to give some of those, or possibly all of those, benefits back.” Separately, Manulife said in a statement it had invested C$1.2 billion ($851.79 million)in renewable energy and energy efficient projects in 2019.

The total number of coronavirus-related deaths rose by just over 4% to 4,280 from 4,111 on Wednesday, official data showed, further evidence the outbreak has peaked. The number of positive diagnoses edged up to 63,895 from 62,458. Quebec, the province hardest hit by the coronavirus, has unveiled plans to gradually restart its economy but on Thursday pushed back for the second time the date when businesses can reopen in Montreal, Canada’s second biggest city. Premier Francois Legault cited shortages of personnel in hospitals and said Quebec would offer higher pay to part-time medical workers. Montreal firms can now only open on May 25, not May 11 as originally planned. “Montreal is fragile - the rest of Quebec is a paradise. That’s how it is, they are two completely different worlds,” said Quebec’s chief public health office Horacio Arruda. Canada’s military is increasing its support in Quebec and aims to have more than 1,350 members in 25 different homes in coming days, Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan told reporters. Trudeau made his announcement a day before Statistics Canada releases unemployment data for April. Analysts say they expect around 4 million people to have lost their jobs after a record 1 million were thrown out of work in March. Manulife Financial Corp's MFC.TO chief executive Roy Gori cautioned against reopening economies too soon. “Subsequent pandemic waves could create greater ... devastation than we’ve already seen,” he said. Under the deal with the provinces, Ottawa will contribute C$3 billion ($2.1 billion), representing 75% percent of the total cost of the increased wages, the government said in a statement. The provinces will be responsible for determining who is essential and how much they receive. Ontario, Canada’s most populous province, will slowly begin resuming elective and non-essential surgeries, Premier Doug Ford announced, starting with the most urgent procedures such as cancer and cardiac surgeries. The Pacific province of British Columbia said it would unveil a plan to handle 30,000 non-urgent surgeries that have been postponed. This involves adding new capacity and hiring and training staff."
27.323483703081568," Manulife CEO warns of 'devastation' if COVID-19 closures end too soon TORONTO (Reuters) - Manulife Financial Corp’s chief executive on Thursday cautioned against reopening economies shut by the COVID-19 pandemic despite challenges that contributed to a 40% decline in first-quarter profit for Canada’s biggest life insurer. A “dramatic increase” in testing and contact tracing, and progress on development of treatments and a vaccine are needed before economies can begin returning to normal, CEO Roy Gori said at Manulife’s annual shareholder meeting. “We cannot afford to get this wrong,” Gori said. “Subsequent pandemic waves could create greater economic and social devastation than we’ve already seen.” Investment gains this year look unlikely, and Manulife expects elevated credit losses through the recession, executives said on an analyst call earlier. The insurer will not meet its medium-term earnings-per-share growth target of 10% to 12% this year, they said. Global insurance companies are seeing plunging yields slam investment returns, while the pandemic has boosted some payout expenses. That has been compounded by a collapse in crude prices with closures due to the outbreak eroding demand. Many North American producers have responded by reducing output. Manulife sees significant pressure on oil prices leading to downgrades on some energy holdings, but doesn’t expect widespread defaults, Chief Investment Officer Scott Hartz said on the call. Manulife saw losses of C$750 million ($533.54 million) in energy investments in its alternative long-duration assets (ALDA) portfolio, Hartz said. That contributed to the decline in the company’s earnings, reported late on Wednesday. Manulife invests in energy companies in ALDA, and in corporate bonds in its fixed income portfolio. One-third of Manulife’s oil and gas bond holdings are in more resilient midstream companies, and 94% are investment grade, Hartz said. Energy investments account for 6% of Manulife’s ALDA portfolio. “Given our limited exposure to high-yield issuers, we do not expect widespread defaults, although given the significant pressure on oil prices,” downgrades are likely, Hartz said. “We would need to get north of $50 (U.S. crude) to encourage significant shale drillings,” he added. “We would expect significant recovery in our portfolio at those levels.” U.S. crude was trading at about half that level on Thursday. Smaller rival Great-West LifeCo on Wednesday posted a 45% drop in first-quarter net income to 37 Canadian cents a share. Sun Life Financial also reported lower profit on Tuesday. Manulife shares reversed earlier gains to fall 1.7% to C$16.40 in Toronto, compared with little change in the Toronto stock benchmark."

26.048536864228396," Canada's Manulife profit declines on market woes, lower Japan sales TORONTO (Reuters) - Manulife Financial Corp MFC.TO reported a 34% drop in first-quarter core earnings on Wednesday, missing analyst expectations, on unfavorable market conditions and lower sales in Japan that weighed on earnings from Asia. While net income attributable to shareholders was helped by gains from widening credit spreads, that was offset by lower-than-expected investment returns, primarily because of the sharp declines in oil prices, the insurer said in a statement. Global insurers have faced a double whammy as market volatility and plunging yields have slammed investment returns, while the COVID-19 outbreak has boosted some payout expenses. “The COVID-19 pandemic continues to disrupt economies and capital markets worldwide, and our operating conditions during the first quarter were understandably affected,” Chief Executive Roy Gori said in the statement. Global wealth and asset management was the only unit to see core earnings gains, with an increase of 7.3% from a year earlier, with net inflows of C$3.2 billion, compared with net outflows of C$1.3 billion a year earlier, largely driven by institutional allocations. The decline in sales in Japan offset increases in Hong Kong and elsewhere in Asia to result in a 5.6% decline for the region, the insurer’s growth driver over the past few years. Core earnings in Canada fell 16% from a year earlier, primarily due to unfavourable travel insurance claims related to COVID-19, while they declined 13% in the U.S. on higher life insurance claims, the insurer said. Manulife in March provided a temporary extension here of emergency out-of-country coverage for Canadian group and individual customers who experienced travel delays. Underlying profit, which excludes the impact of market movements and investment activities, fell to C$1 billion ($706.9 million), or 51 Canadian cents a share, in the three months ended March 31, from C$1.5 billion or 76 cents a share a year earlier, Manulife said. Analysts had expected C$1.1 billion, or 59 cents a share.

58.14666152101914," UPDATE 1-About 75% of Manulife China employees back in offices, CEO says (Recasts to lead with China employees returning to work) TORONTO, March 23 (Reuters) - Most of Manulife Financial Corp’s employees in China have returned to work in its offices, as the spread of the new coronavirus slows, the chief executive of the Toronto-listed insurer said on Monday. “Four weeks ago we had less than 25% of our people coming into the office,” Roy Gori said at a webcast TD Securities event. “As at Friday of last week, we had nearly 75% of employees back in the office.” Mainland China on Monday reported a drop in its daily tally of new coronavirus cases, reversing four straight days of increases, with most new infections in recent days coming from travelers arriving from overseas. As of Sunday, the total number of cases in mainland China stood at 81,093. The death toll rose to 3,270, up nine from the previous day. “Obviously folks are still trying to get their houses in order in China and figuring out how to navigate in this new world,” Gori said. But “there is a shift we’re starting to see in China, more of a normalization is taking place there.” Manulife has accelerated its efforts to enable 12,000 agents in China to interact with clients digitally, and is also recruiting new agents virtually, he said, adding that Manulife also does a lot of its sales remotely in China. On the broader market impact of the outbreak, Gori said Manulife sees opportunities to acquire the debt of good U.S. companies, thanks to the widening of credit spreads following the Federal Reserve’s interest rate cut to near zero. “That’s a big part of our focus, so that’s an opportunity we will definitely continue to focus on and capture,” Gori said. While Manulife’s focus is to grow its existing businesses, it will also look elsewhere if opportunities exist, he said. “In times like these, if there is are opportunities to transact at good value, as long as they are aligned with our strategic priorities, we will consider those,” he said. Gori also said that Manulife has diversified its portfolio and exposure since the global financial crisis, and that it is less sensitive to interest-rate changes and equity market volatility than it was during the global financial crisis.

-40.940385670680925," Canadian insurer Manulife to invest in own business after capital boost TORONTO (Reuters) - Manulife Financial Corp MFC.TO, Canada's biggest insurer, has the flexibility to invest capital into its own businesses after improving its leverage ratio and freeing up billions of dollars, executives said on Thursday. Manulife, which on Wednesday missed analyst expectations for its fourth-quarter earnings, has been on a push to increase efficiencies and free up capital from its legacy business, which includes annuities and long-term care. It has amassed C$5.1 billion ($3.9 billion) of capital through measures including new and renegotiated reinsurance transactions, real estate deals and asset sales, it said on Wednesday. The company achieved its medium-term leverage ratio target of 25% in the past quarter, from 28.6% in 2018, and boosted its quarterly dividend by 12%. The current leverage ratio means “we have quite substantial financial flexibility,” Chief Financial Officer Phil Witherington said on an analyst call on Thursday. “Our highest priority is the opportunity to organically invest... If there are inorganic opportunities out there, we may consider them, but one thing you can be assured of, is we’ll be very disciplined.” The executives did not expand on specific opportunities. Leverage ratio is the sum of long-term debt, capital instruments and preferred shares divided by the sum of long-term debt, capital instruments and total equity. Manulife shares were down l.2% in early afternoon trade. “Business has been good and they want to take the opportunity to tidy up what needs tidying up,” said John Kinsey, portfolio manager at Caldwell Securities, who owns Manulife shares. “This may be long overdue.” As part of its push to cut costs, Manulife has also delivered C$700 million of its C$1 billion target for expense efficiencies, Chief Executive Roy Gori said on the call. It cut 1,900 employees over the past two years, about 5% of its total workforce, through its restructuring initiatives, including early retirement and voluntary exit programs, he added. Rival Sun Life Financial Inc SLF.TO reported core earnings of C$1.34 per share on Wednesday, beating analyst estimates of C$1.30. Sun Life executives said on Thursday the coronavirus outbreak could increase claims in a ""material way"" if the situation deteriorates rapidly, but it is too early to gauge the impact.

-40.940385670680925," Manulife quarterly profit misses estimates, while Sun Life beats (Reuters) - Canada’s biggest life insurers reported increases in core quarterly profit on Wednesday as gains in earnings from wealth and asset management helped offset slower growth elsewhere. Manulife Financial Corp MFC.TO missed estimates as earnings from Canada fell 5.6%, while Sun Life Financial SLF.TO beat expectations despite only posting 2% increase in profit from its Asian business, its traditional growth driver. Both companies said it was too soon to gauge the impact of the coronavirus outbreak in China. Manulife’s chief executive, Roy Gori, told Reuters it was too early to make any changes to the insurer’s business, while Sun Life Chief Financial Officer Kevin Strain said the company has taken steps to speed up processing of claims related to the outbreak. Asia has been the growth engine for Canadian life insurers, with the region’s expanding middle class helping them diversify away from the more mature and intensely competitive market at home. Insurers are also increasingly relying on asset management for a relatively steady source of earnings with low costs. Manulife, Canada’s biggest insurer, posted 16% growth in earnings excluding one-off items from its global wealth and asset management business in the quarter from a year ago. While it reported declines in new business in Japan, 33% growth in Hong Kong and elsewhere in Asia mitigated the impact, CFO Phil Witherington said in an interview. That helped the region post a 6.7% increase in core earnings. Underlying earnings from Sun Life's Asia business grew 2%, in part due to some issues with its China joint venture, Strain said, without elaborating. Sun Life has a 25% stake in a joint venture with China Everbright 601818.SS. Its asset management earnings rose 24% from a year ago. Manulife earned C$1.48 billion ($1.13 billion), excluding one-off items, in the fourth quarter, from C$1.34 billion, a year earlier. Manulife also said it had freed up C$5.1 billion of capital, achieving its planned goal three years early. The cost of doing so was less than C$200 million on an annualized basis, Gori said. On a per share basis, Manulife posted core earnings of 73 Canadian cents, missing estimates of 75 Canadian cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Sun Life’s underlying income rose to C$792 million, or C$1.34 per share, in the fourth quarter, from C$718 million, or C$1.19 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected a profit of C$1.30 per share. Manulife shares have gained 27% over the past year, while Sun Life has added 41%.

Asia has been a focus area for Canadian insurers who have been looking to sell cheaper insurance policies to the region’s burgeoning middle class as domestic markets face intense competition. Manulife’s Asia unit reported a nearly 13% rise in core earnings to C$520 million ($394.6 million), while its domestic and U.S. businesses slipped. Canada’s biggest insurer said annualized premium equivalent sales in Hong Kong surged 58%, driven by its recently launched health insurance and other products. “Our Hong Kong business has been less impacted by the current political situation,” Sun Life Chief Financial Officer Kevin Strain told Reuters. “Hong Kong has a lot of resilience and our performance underscores the strong commitment to Hong Kong and our ability to offer the right savings and insurance products. We have been around in Hong Kong for a long time and we remain committed to Hong Kong.” Underlying net income at the company’s Asia unit rose 25% to C$138 million, while insurance sales jumped 47% from a year earlier. Hong Kong has witnessed massive protests over the past five months over perceived Chinese meddling with the freedoms promised when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997. China denies doing so, and has blamed Western countries for stirring up trouble. Sun Life’s underlying net income rose to C$809 million, or C$1.37 per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, from C$730 million, or C$1.20 per share, a year earlier.

The court’s decision comes after it had reserved its decision last month on whether claims made by the hedge fund against the insurer should be dismissed following the change of rules. Last year, Saskatchewan said it would limit the amount of money investors could put into universal life insurance policies. Manulife had said it believed the new regulations will more quickly resolve the case in its favor. In a case brought by the hedge fund two years ago, it claimed the right to put unlimited funds into an old universal life insurance policy, which is attached to a side account that pays out at least 4 percent a year on excess funds. The policies were sold more than two decades ago, when interest rates were at much higher levels than they are today."
11.864990082101583," UPDATE 2-Canadian court reserves judgment on disputed Manulife policies (Recasts, adds court decision to reserve judgment) TORONTO/SASKATOON, Feb 14 (Reuters) - A court in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan on Thursday reserved its decision on whether claims by a hedge fund against insurer Manulife Financial Corp should be dismissed following a change of rules in the province. Manulife has been fighting the case, brought by Mosten Investment LP two years ago, in which the hedge fund claimed the right to put unlimited funds into an old universal life insurance policy which is attached to a side account that pays out at least 4 percent a year on excess funds. The policies were sold more than two decades ago, when interest rates were at much higher levels than they are today. Manulife asked for the case to be dismissed after Saskatchewan said in October that it would limit the amount of money investors could put into the policies. The company said at that time that it believed the new regulations would more quickly resolve the case in its favor. Mosten argued that the new rules should not be applied retrospectively. The presiding judge Justice Brian Scherman on Thursday thanked both parties for their “helpful submissions” but did not set a date to pass judgment. Shares in Manulife have recovered more than half their losses since falling by 20 percent last October after research firm Muddy Waters said it had taken a short position on the stock, citing the court case. If side accounts are used as investment vehicles, insurers could potentially be exposed to unlimited liability and become insolvent, according to an affidavit filed with the court by a partner with management consultants Oliver Wyman, hired by Manulife to provide evidence. Earlier on Thursday, Manulife’s Chief Executive Roy Gori said the company was “highly confident” of winning the case brought against it by Mosten. “I’m not going to speculate on what the judge is going to say, but we’re highly confident about the position that we have and that we’re ultimately going to prevail in this matter,” Gori said on a conference call. He said was not sure when a decision would be rendered. Manulife on Wednesday reported third-quarter earnings that were in line with market expectations, benefiting from strong growth in Asia.

0.8352996767047748," Manulife seeks dismissal of court case after insurance rule change TORONTO, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Canadian insurer Manulife Financial Corp said on Tuesday it would ask a court in Saskatchewan to dismiss claims made against it by a hedge fund after the province changed its rules to limit how much an investor can put into certain life insurance policies. Manulife has been fighting the case, brought by Mosten Investment LP two years ago, in which the hedge fund claimed the right to put unlimited funds into an old policy known as universal life insurance, which pays out 4.5 percent a year on excess funds. Shares in Manulife have fallen by 14 percent since research firm Muddy Waters said on Oct. 4 it had taken a short position on the stock, citing the court case, which Manulife’s own expert has said in court could be financially damaging to Manulife, if it lost the case and was forced to pay out on unlimited investments on the policy in question and similar ones. In the last few days, Saskatchewan said it would limit the amount of money investors could put into universal life insurance policies. Manulife said it believes the new regulations will more quickly resolve the case in its favor. “With respect to any possible remaining ancillary matters in the litigation, Manulife continues to believe that it will prevail and that those matters are insignificant in any event,” the company said. Shares in Manulife were up 5.3 percent to C$20.92 in early trading in Toronto, still down 10 percent from its level before Muddy Waters disclosed that it had taken a short position.

3.658141925892405," RPT-Manulife faces backlash from investors over failure to disclose court case (Repeats without change) TORONTO, Oct 12 (Reuters) - Canada’s biggest life insurer is under pressure from shareholders to explain why it failed to disclose details of an ongoing court case which came to light after a short-seller released a report detailing the litigation. The stock has dropped 11.5 percent since Muddy Waters Capital LLC said last week that it had taken a short position, compared with a 4.7 percent decline in the stocks in Canada’s financial sector. Muddy Waters cited a court case pending in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan it believes could damage Manulife’s financials. The case against Manulife was filed on Nov. 23, 2016 by Mosten Investment LP, managed by Ontario businessman Michael Hawkins, documents submitted to the court show. The case relates to life insurance policies sold more than two decades ago, when interest rates were at much higher levels than they are today and allowed holders to invest their surplus funds in side accounts with guaranteed interest rates of up to 4.0 percent. The gravity of the case is underscored by an affidavit filed by a partner with management consultants, Oliver Wyman, which states that if the side accounts can be used as investment vehicles it would potential expose insurers to unlimited liability and ultimately cause them to become insolvent. The consultancy was hired by Manulife’s lawyers. Insurance experts say the side accounts were meant to be used to ensure policy holders receiving income on their investments stayed within the limits required to avoid tax. If they were holding excess funds, they were deposited in the side accounts until they could be reinvested in the main policies. Court documents show Mosten, which had a balance of just under C$17,000 in the side account in December, 2012, tried to deposit further funds in the spring of 2016 but Manulife refused to accept further deposits, prompting it to take legal action. Publicly traded companies routinely alert shareholders to material risks through regulatory announcements but Manulife’s decision to withhold the case has angered some shareholders. “I think they should have disclosed it as soon as the legal action was filed,” said Lorne Steinberg, president of Lorne Steinberg Wealth Management Inc, a Manulife shareholder. Manulife declined to comment on Friday about whether it should have informed investors earlier about the case, which it said last Thursday was “legally unfounded”. The Ontario Securities Commission, which regulates publicly-listed companies in the province, declined to comment on the Manulife case. However, its rulebook states that a company’s ongoing legal proceedings be disclosed in an annual information form which is distributed to investors. Two other Manulife shareholders, who asked not to be named due to the sensitivity of the matter, said that they had questioned Manulife’s investor relations team since last Thursday over why the case was not disclosed earlier but were told the insurer believed it may not have a material impact. Shareholders said there should still have been some acknowledgement of the ongoing litigation risk. David Anderson, chief executive of advisory firm Anderson Governance Group, said the case typified a lack of effective communication between Canadian companies and their investors. “This general reluctance of boards to show a meaningful level of transparency expected by their shareholders continues to get companies into trouble,” he said."

-13.987013106734267," UPDATE 1-Manulife shares fall as Muddy Waters announces short position * Muddy Waters says legal case poses material risk to Manulife * Manulife says case is ‘legally unfounded’ (Adds Manulife statement) TORONTO, Oct 4 (Reuters) - Shares of Manulife Financial Corp fell as much as 4 percent on Thursday, hitting their lowest since November 2016, after research firm Muddy Waters Capital LLC said it had taken a short position on Canada’s biggest life insurer. Muddy Waters, which researches companies it thinks have fundamental problems not reflected in their stock price, cited a court case pending in the Canadian province of Saskatchewan which it believes could damage Manulife’s financials. The case, brought against Manulife by an Ontario-based businessman named Michael Hawkins, relates to universal life insurance policies which were underwritten in 1997 by Aetna Life Insurance Co, which was acquired by Manulife in 2004. Manulife said in a statement on Thursday that it disagreed with the conclusions of the Muddy Waters report and that it believed the case against the company was legally unfounded. Universal life insurance is a type of policy sold mostly in the United States where the insurer credits the customer every month when premiums exceed the actual cost of insurance, with interest, building up the cash value of the policy, usually at a contractually agreed minimum rate. The policies were written when interest rates were much higher than now and the case is set to decide whether a holder of one of the policies can force Manulife to back up the policies with very high-yielding, short-term investment grade products. Muddy Waters said a verdict is likely by the end of the year and that there were material risks to the financial health of Manulife that investors have failed to see and price into the stock. Manulife disagreed. “We firmly believe that the consumers purchasing universal life policies, and the insurers issuing these policies, never intended to have the policies function as deposit or securities contracts,” the company said in its statement. “We expect we will prevail with respect to this matter and that it will not affect our business operations or our ability to meet obligations to our customers, vendors and other key stakeholders,” it added. Shares in Manulife were down 3.1 percent at C$22.44 at 1:40 p.m. in Toronto (1740 GMT), on track for their biggest daily fall since March 2017.

-5.131383196642326," Canada's Sun Life, Manulife reap benefits of Asia growth TORONTO (Reuters) - Two of Canada’s biggest insurance companies on Wednesday reported second-quarter earnings which beat market expectations, benefiting in part from strong growth in Asia. Canadian insurance companies are expanding rapidly in the region, selling products to its growing middle class, and the strategy is helping them drive growth and diversify from domestic markets where competition is intense. In an interview, Sun Life’s Chief Executive Officer Dean Connor said the company’s performances in Hong Kong, the Philippines, India and Malaysia had been particularly strong. Connor said the company plans to grow its Asian business to account for more than a quarter of its earnings compared with around 18 percent currently. “The demographics are helpful,” he said. “You’re seeing more people wanting to buy insurance and, in China and India in particular, people in their 30s and 40s are having a more positive view of life insurance than their parents did.” Sun Life reported net income, excluding one-off items, of C$729 million, or C$1.20 share, compared with C$689 million, or C$1.12 Canadian cents per share, the year before. Net income at its Asian business rose to C$145 million from C$123 million a year ago. Analysts had on average forecast earnings, excluding one-off items, of C$1.15, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S data.

-14.537188267035358," Canada's Manulife partners with Loblaw unit to advise medical marijuana patients TORONTO (Reuters) - Manulife Financial Corp, Canada’s biggest insurance company, said on Tuesday it will partner with a drugstore chain owned by Loblaw Companies to provide advice to patients whose medical marijuana use it covers. Manulife and Canadian rival Sun Life Financial Inc already provide limited medical cannabis cover for select clients, with annual limits and for a few conditions, making Canada one of the few countries in the world where insurers underwrite marijuana-related claims. Starting this fall, trained pharmacists at Loblaw-owned Shoppers Drug Mart will give guidance to Manulife customers on the right strains of medical cannabis and the different ways to use it, Manulife said in a statement. Patients will still have to order medical cannabis from licensed producers and receive it by mail, as storefront access remains illegal. Canadian law allows patients to pay for medical cannabis with money from healthcare spending accounts, which are financed by employers, but insurance companies make their own decisions on including it in their benefit plans. Insurers have been slow to cover medical cannabis in a manner similar to pharmaceutical drugs, wary of the potentially high costs of coverage and a dearth of clinical evidence for its efficacy."

Reuters reported in February that Manulife was weighing the sale of a number of U.S. insurance assets after conducting a strategic review of its U.S. operations including its John Hancock business. Manulife also said it had set a target to cut its expenses by C$1 billion by 2022. The company last week said it planned to cut 700 jobs in Canada as part of a drive to automate certain functions.

The cuts represent about 5 percent of Manulife’s Canadian employees and 2 percent of its global workforce, and will take place partly through voluntary exit programs. The company will also merge its Canadian division’s headquarters into one location from the present two in order to improve efficiency. Manulife and other financial services companies are saving costs by automating job functions with artificial intelligence and other technology, which, for instance, helps make underwriting decisions automatically.
