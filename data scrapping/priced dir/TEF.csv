-6.404958677685943," Telefonica stock surges on $9.4 billion asset sale to American Towers MADRID (Reuters) - Shares in Telefonica soared on Wednesday after the Spanish group said it had agreed to sell its mobile phone masts in Europe and Latin America to American Towers for 7.7 billion euros ($9.41 billion) in cash. Telefonica’s Telxius division, partly owned by investment fund KKR and Zara owner Amancio Ortega’s investment vehicle, will hand over more than 30,000 mobile phone masts in Spain, Germany, Brazil, Peru, Chile and Argentina. U.S.-based American Towers will then lease the phone masts back to Telefonica, leaving the Spanish group only owning tower assets in Britain. Telefonica, which alongside European peers has struggled to prop up a sagging share price in the face of fierce competition, will be able to use sale proceeds to trim by 4.6 billion euros its net debt that piled up during hefty investment in networks. It has said it aims to focus on more profitable businesses and exit less profitable markets such as those in Latin America. Shares were trading 8.7% higher on the day at 0845 GMT, outperforming a very slightly positive Madrid blue-chip index. Long-term income streams tied to inflation have turned towers into prized investment targets in a world of low returns. These networks are set to expand to accommodate next-generation 5G internet and eventually link up billions of smart devices. Telefonica Chief Executive Josa Maria Alvarez-Pallete said the deal meant the firm could focus on its “more ambitious goals”, such as a deal to merge its British operations under the O2 brand with Virgin Media, the acquisition of Brazilian carrier Oi’s mobile assets and debt reduction. As of September, net financial debt was 2.77 times core adjusted earnings. Proceeds from the American Towers deal include a capital gain of about 3.5 billion euros, Telefonica said. For the U.S. firm, which dwarves its main European rival Cellnex, the deal gives access to a European market made increasingly attractive by the 5G rollout. Cellnex has already built up a tower network spanning most of Europe, while Vodafone is planning to list its own infrastructure unit Vantage towers in Frankfurt. Telefonica has said it is looking at all possible options for the future of the part of Telxius it still owns, which is an undersea cable between Europe and the United States. ($1 = 0.8187 euros)"

Cornerstone will be the preferred supplier of new tower sites for the two mobile operators’ UK units for an initial eight years from the start of this month with three eight-year renewal periods under the new deal, Vodafone said on Monday. Vodafone spun out its European towers last year to take advantage of investor appetite for infrastructure assets, which offer a long-term secured income stream. It plans to list the unit in Frankfurt in the coming months, and will use the proceeds to reduce its debt.

14.827753311541352," Cellnex would be interested in Telefonica towers: CEO BERLIN (Reuters) - Cellnex, the Spanish telecoms infrastructure company, would be interested in buying into Telefonica’s mobile towers business should the opportunity arise, CEO Tobias Martinez said on Thursday. The expression of interest by Martinez came after Telefonica Chief Operating Officer Angel Vila said the company would consider relinquishing control to give its Telxius subsidiary more headroom to grow. “My wish is always to acquire the towers of all of the telecom operators. Why not? It’s my core business!” Martinez told the Morgan Stanley Technology, Media and Telecom conference. Cellnex has, through a string of audacious deals, emerged as the leading candidate to roll up European tower assets being cast off by operators trying to raise capital to pay for costly network upgrades to launch 5G services. The Barcelona-based company has just pulled off its biggest acquisition to date by buying 24,600 towers across Europe from Hong Kong’s CK Hutchison for 10 billion euros ($11.83 billion). Pure-play towers operations are able to crank up financial leverage to acquire infrastructure assets that produce predictable and growing revenue streams as data volumes grow - an approach applauded by investors who have sent Cellnex shares up by 45% this year. Some other telecoms operators are looking to get in on the act, with Vodafone planning to float its Vantage Towers operation on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange next year after carving it out into a separate business. Cellnex’s equity market value of around 24 billion euros now exceeds that of Telefonica, whose shares have dropped this year as its weak operating performance raised questions over its ability to support a debt pile of 43 billion euros. Vila, speaking at the Morgan Stanley conference on Wednesday, said Telefonica would consider reducing its stake in Telxius below half - a move that would give the business more scope to leverage up and do deals. “If you have restriction on leverage that independent towercos don’t have, it is very difficult to grow inorganically,” Vila said. “We are open to potential options that could take us below 50% of Telxius towers provided those allow the company to develop and grow faster.” Telefonica owns Telxius along with private equity firm KKR and Zara owner Amancio Ortega’s investment fund Pontegadea. “My personal ambition would obviously be to find a way to cooperate or to invest,” Martinez said, when asked to respond to Vila’s comment. He added, however, that no talks were yet taking place: “I don’t want to speculate.” ($1 = 0.8453 euros)"

-25.72706571778688," UPDATE 2-Spain's Telefonica suffers earnings hit from coronavirus and currencies (Adds shares, detail) MADRID, July 30 (Reuters) - Spain’s Telefonica posted sharply lower quarterly earnings on Thursday as measures to contain the coronavirus sapped demand for services including roaming and handset sales. Telefonica last November launched a plan to boost revenue in a crowded European sector long struggling to grow, but shortly afterwards the pandemic started sweeping its main markets of Spain, Britain, Germany and Brazil. Shares fell as much as 3% in early trade, underperforming Spain’s blue-chip index, after reported revenue and core earnings before depreciation and amortisation (OIBDA) slumped 14.8% and 25.3% respectively year on year. The figures came in a shade below a consensus forecast provided by the company, the latter partly due to an impairment charge in Argentina. Unfavourable foreign exchange movements, particularly for its Brazilian business, had a cumulative impact on OIBDA of 6.7 percentage points. On the positive side, free cash flow improved, contributing to a reduction in net debt. The month of May was the worst affected by the virus, but June saw a “notable recovery in commercial activity”, the company said. This included Spain, its largest market, which imposed one of Europe’s strictest COVID-19 lockdowns. With restrictions gradually lifting, Telefonica maintained a 0.40 euros per share dividend and guidance for an increase in the ratio of core earnings excluding capital expenditure over revenue in 2022. Aiming to cut back its operations in less profitable Latin American companies and further pare debt, the company announced the sale of its Costa Rica business for 425 million euros. Telefonica shares have been tracking lower over the past five years and suffered a 37% drop so far this year, compared with a 15% fall in the benchmark STOXX Europe 600 index."

The Luxembourg-based General Court in its May judgment said the European Commission had failed to prove that the 2016 deal would harm competition or push up prices. The ruling was a rare setback for the EU competition enforcer, raising hopes in the telecoms industry of a looser rein on mergers aimed at sharing costly 5G investments. The Commission said on Wednesday that it would appeal the judgment at the EU Court of Justice (CJEU). “The General Court’s judgement raised important legal issues, such as the legal test for ‘gap’ cases, the role of efficiencies, the standard of proof, the value of the Commission’s economic assessment and the boundaries of the General Court’s judicial control,” spokeswoman Arianna Podesta said. Gap cases refer to mergers which raise concerns even though the companies are not dominant. “The Commission respectfully considers that on these issues the General Court made a number of errors of law and is asking the European Court of Justice to set aside the General Court’s judgment in that respect,” Podesta said.

-23.34003304267858," Banks pile into Liberty-Telefonica loan LONDON, June 11 (LPC) - Over 30 banks have piled into a £4bn loan to back a US$38bn merger of the British businesses of Liberty Global and Telefonica after the borrowers tapped their large banking relationships to secure the deal within a ten-day period. JP Morgan and Citigroup underwrote the £4bn 2.5-year term loan in May to back the merger of Liberty’s Virgin Media with Telefonica’s O2. Syndication of the loan was launched shortly afterwards and closed at the end of May when an additional 30 banks were bought into the deal. Some 36 banks were initially approached, with 32 able to commit to the loan, which pays a margin of 150bp over Libor with a 40bp upfront fee, within the tight ten-day deadline. The banks were initially asked to commit to at least £250m, but were then scaled back by 50% to £125m. “That is a pretty big scale back. It is not unprecedented in investment-grade lending but it is not typical either. It is an indication of the strength of Liberty and Telefonica as corporate borrowers,” a senior banker said. The 32 banks are Citi, JP Morgan, ABN Amro, BBVA, Banca Sabadell, Bank of America, Bankia, Bankinter, Barclays, BNP Paribas, CaixaBank, Commerzbank, Credit Agricole CIB, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, HSBC, ING, Intesa Sanpaolo, Lloyds, Mediobanca, Mizuho, Morgan Stanley, MUFG, Natwest, Natixis, RBC, Santander, Societe Generale, SMBC, Scotiabank and UniCredit. Liberty and Telefonica were not immediately available to comment on the financing details. The large bank group reflects the vast amount of relationships both entities have. However, a number of lenders would have preferred fewer banks and a larger ticket to get paid bigger fees. “This is just Europe for you, there are too many banks. In this deal there are the regional Spanish banks, the pan-European banks and the US banks. It is a good quality asset and a pretty straightforward deal so banks piled in,” a second senior banker said. The loan will be used to initially de-risk the transaction. It is then expected to be refinanced next year and increased to in excess of £6bn through a combination of multi-currency leveraged loans and high-yield bonds, sitting across both balance sheets. Leverage at that point will stand at between four and five times. “Liberty and Telefonica is going to be one of the most active issuers on the street and so while this is an i-grade transaction for now, Liberty will be doing more deals and significant debt issuance and as a result makes it one of the most attractive borrowers in the market,” the first senior banker said. The take out next year is expected to draw significant attention from leveraged loan and high-yield bond investors, attracted by its size and the fact that the TMT sector has been strong and performed well, despite Covid-19. The combined company will have the largest non-investment-grade balance sheet in Europe, bankers said. The parent companies, which expect to achieve £6.2bn of synergies on an annual basis by the fifth full year after closing, will have equal ownership of the combined entity.

-32.15548340347155," Telefonica to sell phone masts in Germany to Telxius for 1.5 billion euros MADRID (Reuters) - Telefonica's German division TEF.MC has signed a deal to sell thousands of phone masts for 1.5 billion euros, the latest move by a telecom operator to generate cash from its assets in preparation for investment in next-generation 5G internet. Telefonica Deutschland will sell around 10,100 masts to Telxius Telecom, the infrastructure company the Spanish group owns with private equity firm KKR KKR.N and Zara owner Amancio Ortega's investment fund Pontegadea, Telefonica said in a Spanish bourse filing on Monday. Telxius will finance 90% of the operation from its own resources and through a capital hike that will be proportionately subscribed by its current shareholders according to their participation in the company, Telefonica said. The remaining 10% will be financed with debt. As a consequence of the deal, Telefonica’s overall net debt would be trimmed by around 500 million euros between 2020 and 2021, it said. The operation with Telxius, which is subject to regulatory approvals, would take place in two stages, being completed in August 2021. It also includes a commitment to build 2,400 additional masts in four years, granting Telxius a portfolio of over 32,000 masts in six countries. Phone masts have long been popular among investors because they generate steady revenue. The CEO of Telefonica’s German unit said last month he was seeing “extremely high demand” for Telefonica Deutschland’s towers, and valuations were high enough to justify sales. Telefonica said last year that, outside of Telxius, it owned around 50,000 mast sites that could generate core earnings of around 360 million euros ($406.62 million). As part of a new strategy to boost revenue announced last year, the company plans to create a separate unit to hold its infrastructure assets, the like of which have attracted much higher prices in recent years than investors are willing to fork out for operators’ shares."

-10.729611795821945," Liberty and Telefonica agree $38 billion UK tie-up to take on BT LONDON/MADRID (Reuters) - Liberty Global LBTYA.O and Telefonica TEF.MC have agreed to merge their British businesses in a $38 billion deal that will create a powerhouse in mobile and broadband to take on market leader BT BT.L. In the biggest shake-up of the British telecoms market for five years, the deal will bring together the biggest cable TV provider in Liberty’s Virgin Media with Telefonica’s O2, the second-largest mobile operator. The tie-up mirrors a succession of European deals struck by Liberty’s billionaire founder John Malone to create one-stop shops for mobile and broadband. The Telefonica deal will allow the debt-laden Spanish company to extract cash while remaining in Britain, having tried and failed to sell O2 in 2016. It will also force rivals Vodafone VOD.L, Comcast's CMCSA.O Sky, Three UK 0001.HK and TalkTalk TALK.L to examine whether they need to have the full set of fixed and mobile assets to keep up. “It’s not a secret any more, when 5G meets 1 gig broadband we know magic can happen for customers,” Liberty Global CEO Mike Fries told reporters on a conference call, referring to superfast internet speeds in both mobile and broadband. Telefonica CEO Jose Maria Alvarez-Pallete said the two businesses would be “much stronger together”. Under the terms of the deal, one of the biggest since the coronavirus pandemic upended the world economy, the parent companies will have equal ownership of the combined entity. They expect to achieve 6.2 billion pounds ($7.7 billion) in total operating benefits, equivalent to 540 million pounds a year by the fifth full year after closing. The deal values O2 at 12.7 billion pounds and Virgin Media at 18.7 billion pounds, giving a combined value of 31.4 billion pounds including debt. Liberty will pay Telefonica 2.5 billion pounds to equalise ownership. After recapitalisations, the Spanish group expects to receive further proceeds of 5.7 billion pounds. Liberty will receive 1.4 billion pounds, the companies said. The newly formed entity will invest 10 billion pounds in the UK market over five years. That will help it to keep up with former British monopoly BT, which on Thursday announced it was spending 12 billion pounds to upgrade its legacy copper network to faster full-fibre connections, targeting 20 million premises by the mid-to-late 2020s. The new group will also hope to capture a bigger share of the business sector, competing with BT and Vodafone just as the coronavirus pandemic forces companies to cut spending. It could further hurt Vodafone, the world’s second-biggest mobile operator, which has struggled in its home UK market and had signed a deal to provide mobile services to Virgin from next year. Shares in BT, which announced separately that it was suspending its dividend until 2021/22, fell as much as 12% to an 11-year low of 101.1 pence before retracing some losses. Telefonica’s share rose 3.5% at the market open but turned negative as investors digested news of the deal and of falling quarterly profit and an option for shareholders to receive part of their 0.40 euros dividend in stock. Alvarez-Pallete, who has responded to concerns over low profit growth and high debt with a plan to focus on more profitable markets including Britain, told a virtual news conference he had not expected the market to reward Thursday’s announcement immediately. “We are convinced that with both these actions - signing this deal and the dividend policy we have proposed - our company gets stronger,” he said. Including O2, Telefonica’s UK business has about 34.5 mobile connections and generated 14.7% of group sales last year. Vodafone shares dipped 1% in morning trade before edging into positive territory in the afternoon. “Personally, I think the industry needs consolidation so it’s a sensible move. It follows our strategy,” BT CEO Philip Jansen told reporters, noting how Britain’s largest fixed-line provider bought its biggest mobile network, EE, in a deal that closed in early 2016. Liberty’s Fries said the merger talks with Telefonica started before the coronavirus outbreak swept the world. CCS Insight analyst Kester Mann said the O2 brand had strong customer loyalty so should be kept if any others were to be cut. Virgin Media, bought by Malone in 2013, was formed from a combination of Britain’s cable assets and Virgin Mobile, the pioneering virtual mobile network, in 2007. It licenses Richard Branson’s Virgin brand and has about 6 million cable customers and 3.3 million mobile customers. The 79-year-old Malone has built his empire over more than 40 years of dealmaking in the cable and pay-TV industry, funded largely through debt. Liberty is one of Europe’s largest TV and broadband companies, with operations in six countries under the consumer brands of Virgin Media, Telenet and UPC. Malone sold his networks in Germany and central Europe to Vodafone last year as part of the wave of deals to combine mobile with fixed-line operations. Analysts expect this deal, which involves predominantly mobile and fixed-line operators rather than two mobile firms, to be approved by regulators, as occurred with BT’s purchase of EE. Liberty was advised by J.P. Morgan and LionTree while Citigroup acted as financial adviser to Telefonica."

-10.729611795821945," Telefonica withdraws 2020 guidance after first-quarter profit fall MADRID (Reuters) - Spanish telecoms company Telefonica SA TEF.MC withdrew its 2020 financial guidance after reporting a sharp fall in first-quarter net profit on Thursday. Net profit fell to 406 million euros ($438 million) from 926 million a year earlier on revenue of 11.37 billion, in line with forecasts from analysts polled by the company. Europe’s fourth-largest telecoms firm by market value said the impact on profits of the coronavirus was limited, as lower revenues from roaming, prepaid and business customers were partly offset by lower commercial costs and lower customer churn. Operating income before depreciation and amortisation fell to 3.76 billion euros from 4.26 billion, missing a forecast of 3.84 billion euros provided by the company. The company confirmed a 0.40 euro dividend for 2020. Separately, it said it would merge its UK unit O2 mobile business with Liberty Global's LBTYA.O cable company Virgin Media to create a major new force in the British telecoms market. Telefonica is trying to reinvent itself to fight fierce competition and boost revenue in the next two years by focusing on its most profitable markets - Spain, Britain, Germany and Brazil - and considering mergers and acquisitions. In February, before the spread of the coronavirus froze economies worldwide, Telefonica had said it expected sales and core profit to be stable this year.

The companies are expected to announce the deal to merge Telefonica’s British mobile operator O2 and Liberty’s Virgin Cable network company on Thursday after five months of negotiations, the newspaper said citing sources. The parent companies, which expect to achieve 700 million pounds worth of synergies by merging, would have equal ownership of the combined entity, the report said, adding that Telefónica would receive 5.5 billion pounds in cash to help it reduce its heavy debt. Liberty Global and Telefónica did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. Liberty Global would take 1.5 billion pounds in cash after splitting out Virgin Media’s Irish business, which would not be included in the merger with O2, according to the report. Spain’s Telefonica had confirmed earlier this week that it was in talks with billionaire John Malone’s Liberty Global over a possible merger of their respective businesses in Britain. The deal would allow Telefonica to squeeze cash from O2 and keep a presence in Britain, while Virgin would gain access to its own wireless network, saving the money it has spent until now on leasing capacity for its mobile operations."
-10.967757555571344," Telefonica, TIM to move ahead with Brazil M&A plans despite COVID-19 SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian telecoms firms Telefonica Brasil SA VIVT4.SA and TIM Participacoes SA TIMP3.SA are moving ahead with a potential joint bid for rival Oi SA's OIBR4.SA mobile unit despite the challenges of the COVID-19 outbreak, executives said Wednesday. The carriers have begun due diligence on a plan announced in March to acquire Oi’s assets together. Meanwhile, they remain focused on expanding their fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) network, as well as fourth-generation (4G) mobile coverage, while a long-awaited auction for next-generation spectrum remains uncertain. “We’re confident that our strategy is the right one,” Telefonica Brasil Chief Executive Christian Gebara told investors on a call, noting it is still early to assess the full extent of the global pandemic. “The level of uncertainty is much higher, but we’re not willing to cut costs or capital expenditure that will help us grow and compete in the long term,” TIM Chief Executive Pietro Labriola said on a separate call. The executives did not detail how long the due diligence on Oi’s mobile unit would take, but said they would have a clearer idea on the timeline in coming months. TIM and Telefonica Brasil are also working together on an infrastructure sharing agreement, pending regulatory approval, as well as exploring other partnerships to accelerate FTTH deployment in Brazil, they said. In the first-quarter, the two companies reported weaker-than-expected results, as the pandemic hit revenues, mostly in pre-paid plans and handset sales, overshadowing efficiency gains from digitalization efforts and other cost-cutting initiatives. TIM shares fell nearly 2% in afternoon trading and Telefonica Brasil slipped around 1%. UBS analysts see Telefonica Brasil, the local unit of Spain's Telefonica SA TEF.MC, which operates under the brand Vivo, less affected by economic and mobility challenges in the country given its premium brand and subscriber mix. “FTTH momentum and apparent competitive landscape stability provide evidence of Vivo’s resiliency, which should remain even as the pandemic and its effects further hinder economic activity,” UBS analyst Vinicius Ribeiro wrote in a report. At the end of March, 58.5% of Telefonica Brasil’s mobile customers were using post-paid plans. For TIM, Ribeiro flagged uncertainty about the impact of the coronavirus crisis, given the carrier’s higher exposure to pre-paid plans, which represented 59% of its mobile base in March. In the last two weeks of March, the local subsidiary of Telecom Italia TLIT.MI saw pre-paid recharges drop as much as 25%, said Labriola, adding that numbers are slowly improving as social distancing measures are relaxed. Vivo has also noted a slight recovery in handset sales and mobile data usage in April compared with the second half of March, when stay-at-home measures led customers to use more home internet and stores were shut by lockdowns. “We don’t expect customers to downgrade their post-paid plans because we offered a lot of benefits,” Gebara added."
-8.193280282935447," Telefonica shares rise on O2-Virgin Media merger talks (Reuters) - Shares in Spain's Telefonica SA TEF.MC rose on Monday to post the only strong gains on an otherwise almost entirely red Madrid index, after the company confirmed it was in talks with billionaire John Malone's Liberty Global Plc LBTYA.O over a possible merger of their respective businesses in Britain. The two have started a negotiation process to merge Telefonica’s British mobile operator O2 and Liberty’s Virgin Media network company, the Spanish company said in a stock market filing. There is “no guarantee, at this point, of its precise terms or its probability of success,” Telefonica added. Two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Friday that talks were ongoing. Telefonica shares rose shortly after Monday's market open and were trading 3.2% higher on the day at 0809 GMT. It was the only strong gainer, barring some small positive movements for stocks including communications tower firm Cellnex CLNX.MC. It would be “potentially positive news for the stock if this is confirmed” Madrid-based broker CM Capital Markets said in a note to clients, adding the integration of mobile-focused O2 with a major fixed broadband provider would be complementary. Telefonica said it would keep markets informed if a “satisfactory agreement” were reached. The company reports first-quarter results on May 7. Along with its large European peers, Telefonica has struggled to boost profit growth in the face of fierce competition and reassure investors it can manage a debt pile which stood at 37.74 billion euros at the end of last year. Shares are down 30% so far this year, having tracked broadly downwards for the past five years. Its UK business, which includes O2, generated 7.11 billion euros in revenue in 2019, around 14.7% of the group’s total, and had 34.5 mobile connections on its network. Virgin Media competes with UK pay-TV market leader Sky, owned by Comcast CMCSA.O, in pay-TV, and with BT BT.L, Sky, TalkTalk and others in broadband. It had 6 million cable customers and 3.3 million mobile customers as of the end of 2019. Telefonica has been weighing options for the mobile business since 2016 when a previous 10.3 billion pound ($12.8 billion) O2 takeover bid from Three UK, controlled by CK Hutchison Holdings 0001.HK, was blocked by European antitrust regulators. Combining O2 and Virgin Media would reshape Britain's telecoms industry, leaving Hutchison and Vodafone VOD.L without their own fixed-line consumer networks and raising pressure on BT. Uncertainty around the fate of one Britain’s biggest mobile operators, which has been repeatedly touted as a possible candidate for sale or a stock listing, would end. The deal would also allow Telefonica a way to partially cash out from O2 while keeping a presence in Britain, where - along with Spain, Germany and Brazil - it aims to focus its efforts to boost revenue by 2 billion euros under a new strategic plan."

Luxembourg-based Millicom said Telefonica had failed to secure regulatory approvals needed for the sale to go ahead by May 1, granting it the right to pull out. Millicom, which gave no reason for its decision to exit the deal, did not specify which approvals were still pending but said it would vigorously defend any legal action brought by Telefonica. Telefonica declined to comment on Millicom’s decision. Earlier in the week, Telefonica had said all the conditions needed for closing the deal had been met and it would sue Millicom if it failed to honour the deal. Costa Rican business newspaper El Financiero quoted the government as saying it had given the necessary authorizations. The Costa Rica unit formed part of a broader package of Central American operations also including those in Panama and Nicaragua which Telefonica agreed to sell to Millicom in February 2019 for $1.65 billion. The other elements of the sale are unaffected by the Costa Rican decision. Telefonica last November announced a turnaround plan to bring in 2 billion euros ($2.2 billion) a year in extra revenue by hiving off more of its Latin American businesses and focusing on its core markets of Spain, the United Kingdom, Brazil and Germany.

-13.195877764756467," Telefonica seeks to merge Britain's O2 and Virgin Media: sources MADRID/LONDON (Reuters) - Spain's Telefonica SA TEF.MC is in talks with billionaire John Malone's Liberty Global Plc LBTYA.O to explore a merger of its British mobile operator O2 with Liberty's Virgin Media cable network company, two sources familiar with the matter said. Telefonica has been weighing options for the mobile business since 2016 when a previous 10.3 billion pound deal takeover of O2 by Three UK, controlled by CK Hutchison Holdings 0001.HK, was blocked by European antitrust regulators, banking sources said. A combination of O2 and Virgin Media would reshape Britain's telecoms industry, leaving Hutchison and Vodafone VOD.L stranded without their own fixed-line consumer networks. If successful, the deal would end uncertainty around the fate of one Britain’s biggest mobile operators after it was repeatedly touted as a possible candidate for a sale or a stock listing in recent years. It would also offer Telefonica a way to partially cash out from O2 while retaining a presence in Britain, which the company sees as one of its “core markets” along with Spain, Germany and Brazil. Malone, who transformed the pay-TV sector in the United States, combined Liberty’s Dutch operations with Vodafone’s in 2016 in a joint venture deal which could offer the blueprint for a merger of O2 and Virgin Media, one of the sources said. He added that discussions between Telefonica and Liberty were focusing on creating a joint venture equally owned by the two firms. Shares in Liberty were up 8.75% at $21.12 on the news. Telefonica’s overriding goal to reduce its debt load - which stood at 37.74 billion euros at the end of last year - would likely shape the deal, Jefferies analysts wrote in a note after Bloomberg first reported news of the talks. A cash acquisition would be within reach for Liberty, they said, but a joint venture structure could still satisfy Telefonica’s pressing need to cut its leverage. Telefonica has been active in Britain since 2006 when it took control of O2 and made it the first British network to offer Apple’s iPhone in 2007, a deal that attracted more high-value customers to the brand. O2, led by boss Mark Evans, had 25.8 million contracts and pre-paid mobile subscribers at the end of 2019. Telefonica’s UK business, which includes O2, generated 7.11 billion euros in revenue in 2019, around 14.7% of the group’s total, and had 34.5 mobile connections on its network. But faced with dwindling profits, Telefonica announced in November a turnaround plan to bring in 2 billion euros a year in extra revenue by hiving off part of its Latin American business and focusing on its core markets including Britain. At the time, Chief Executive Jose Maria Alvarez-Pallete said the company was open to reviewing possible merger options. Liberty Global, which has controlled Virgin Media since 2013, sold its cable networks in Germany and central Europe to Vodafone in a $22 billion deal which was finalised last year, reigniting talk among analysts of a deeper tie-up in Britain. The firm is expected to plough the cash from the Vodafone sale into the O2 deal, said the source who commented on a possible blueprint for a merger, cautioning no final agreement had been reached. Virgin Media competes with UK pay-TV market leader Sky, owned by Comcast CMCSA.O, in pay-TV, and with BT BT.L, Sky, TalkTalk and others in broadband. It had 6 million cable customers and 3.3 million mobile customers as of the end of 2019. Despite its sizeable mobile business, Virgin Media has never owned its own wireless network. It instead pioneered the MVNO model, whereby an operator piggybacks on an existing network, 20 years ago with a partnership with the forerunner of BT’s EE."

The move comes months after the struggling carrier, which filed for bankruptcy protection in June 2016, told market participants early in December it had hired financial advisors to put a value on its mobile unit. Preferred shares in Oi rose as much as 18% on Wednesday morning, while TIM stocks surged up to 8.3% and Telefonica Brasil climbed 4.4% before trimming earlier gains. TIM and Telefonica Brasil informed Oi’s advisor Bank of America of their interest in kicking off talks for a potential acquisition of all or part of Oi’s mobile division. If their bid is successful, the two companies would divide up that business, securities filings showed, without disclosing how the division would be. Telefonica, the Brazilian subsidiary of Spain's Telefonica SA TEF.MC, operates Brazil's largest wireless carrier under the brand Vivo. TIM, which is controlled by Telecom Italia SpA TLIT.MI, said it had informed its board of directors of their approach. It is not the first time that TIM and Telefonica join forces to broaden their operations amid an increasingly competitive market. In December, both signed network-sharing agreements involving 2G, 3G and 4G networks. In a separate filing, Oi said the joint bid attempt, which it described as “sounding out the market,” showed that there was interest in its mobile operation. “So far, however, there is no commitment from Oi or any other third parties to materialize such disposal nor has any biding instrument been signed,” Oi added. In September, Reuters reported that Oi was in talks with the two firms to sell assets and avoid insolvency. Executives from all three major carriers in Brazil - Telefonica Brasil, TIM and America Movil SAB de CV's AMXL.MX Claro - said at the time they could consider a deal with Oi. Analysts at BTG Pactual see TIM and Telefonica Brasil’s joint offer for Oi’s mobile unit as positive for all players involved. “As they will not compete with each other for the asset, preventing the entry of a new competitor and capturing great synergies with the deal,” they wrote. Oi, in turn, will have the opportunity to raise cash to partially pay its debt and accelerate investments in fiber-to-the-home (FTTH), BTG analysts added."

-34.51851937295256," Shares in Spain's Telefonica dive after 2019 net profit disappoints MADRID (Reuters) - Shares in Spain's Telefonica TEF.MC dived in opening trade on Thursday, leading losers on Madrid's blue-chip index after the company posted a sharp fall in net profit mainly due to an expensive layoff program in its home country. Along with its peers, Europe’s fourth-largest telecoms group is battling to boost profit growth in an increasingly crowded market, and promised to reinvent itself in November. As part of the turnaround plan, Telefonica offered early retirement to employees aged 53 or over in Spain, contributing to 2.2 billion euros in restructuring provisions that led to a 66% fall in reported full-year net income. Losses in Mexico and an impairment charge in Argentina also weighed on profit toward the end of the year. The results were “negative for the stock as net profit came clearly below consensus estimates”, Madrid-based broker C.M. Capital Markets said in a note to clients. Shares fell more than 5% by 0833 GMT. The company predicted sales and core profit would remain stable over the coming year, saying underlying growth in its key markets had helped meet growth targets for 2019. Sales hit 48.42 billion euros ($52.27 billion) for the full year, rising faster than a targeted annual increase of 2% once currency fluctuations and hyperinflation in Latin America were stripped out. This beat an analyst consensus forecast provided by the company of 47.8 billion euros, and underpinned an annual rise of 1.9% in operating income before depreciation and amortisation (OIBDA). “We are expecting stable growth in the main metrics, a stable and attractive dividend, with a long-term commitment to a sustainable and responsible growth,” Chief Executive Jose Maria Alvarez-Pallete said in a statement. Alvarez-Pallete said all the group’s main markets - which it has identified as Spain, Brazil, Germany and Britain - showed organic growth in 2019. In reported terms, OIBDA came out negative, down 2.9% on the year at 15.1 billion euros due to restructuring costs, a goodwill impairment in Argentina, capital gains and other factors. The company also introduced a new measure to its guidance, forecasting a 2 percentage point rise between 2019 and 2022 in the ratio of OIBDA minus capital expenditure to revenue."

The move, first reported by Spanish economic daily Expansion, marks a strategic shift for Telefonica which previously relied only on Huawei. The Chinese company provided Telefonica’s 3G and 4G core networks in Spain. U.S. President Donald Trump in May placed Huawei on the country’s trade blacklist, citing national security concerns, and pressured its allies to shut out the company from their networks. Huawei has repeatedly denied that its products pose a security threat. Other European operators, including Britain’s Vodafone and Deutsche Telekom, are also opting for multiple vendors. But Deutsche Telekom has called a halt to any new contracts until the debate on whether to bar Huawei on national security grounds yields some answers. When the U.S. put Huawei on the blacklist, Telefonica had said it was reviewing the details and potential impact. The core is the main hub of a mobile network. Telefonica has not decided yet who will provide the rest of its kit, such as its 5G antennas in Spain, the spokesman added."

Along with its peers, Europe’s fourth-largest telecoms company is struggling to achieve solid profit growth. Its shares, which touched their lowest level in more than two decades amid increasingly tough market conditions, had lost 9% of their value this year before the announcement. “The model is tired out so we need to reinvent ourselves,” Chief Executive Jose Maria Alvarez-Pallete told a news conference on Wednesday called unexpectedly after a board meeting to approve the plan. The new measures include an “operational spin-off” of Telefonica’s business in Spanish-speaking Latin America, leaving the company to focus on key markets in Spain, the United Kingdom, Brazil and Germany. Alvarez-Pallete said the company would conduct a strategic review and was open to mergers and acquisitions. The company hopes the revenue boost will come from a new unit, Telefonica Tech, formed initially by grouping together cybersecurity, the Internet of Things and cloud computing. The Internet of Things refers to the smart devices that are expected to fill digital workplaces and homes. “Everything will be connected and emitting information in real time, so there will be an explosion of data,” Alvarez-Pallete said. The different areas of the new unit are already attracting interest from “all kinds of partners, from industrials to technological partners, technology funds, to invest in these lines,” Alvarez-Pallete said. But “we will only do it if we believe it has value.” Telefonica will also create a unit to hold its portfolio of communications towers and other infrastructure assets, providing services to other operators and incorporating partners. Recent deals have seen buyers pay much more for communications infrastructure assets than they are willing to fork out for operators’ shares, and Alvarez-Pallete said financial institutions were interested in investing alongside Telefonica. Communications towers in particular have long been popular among institutional investors because of their steady cash flows, and operators are increasingly looking to squeeze cash out of them as they face the high costs of rolling out new technology."

Financial terms of the deal with AT&T were not disclosed. Analysts framed the deal as a lifeline for Telefonica in Mexico, where the company has long struggled to gain traction. Despite a 2013-14 reform intended to lessen its dominance, America Movil still holds nearly two-thirds of mobile lines in Mexico, according to data from telecoms regulator IFT. AT&T, too, has failed to significantly dent America Movil’s market share since it spent billions to enter the country in 2015 by buying two local carriers. The agreement will give both Telefonica and AT&T a boost in a brutally competitive market, said Roger Entner, an analyst at Recon Analytics. “It’s the two upstarts going up against the big guy,” Entner said. “You need to find all the friends that you can when someone has such a dominant position.” Telefonica Mexico Chief Executive Officer Camilo Aya told reporters the deal with AT&T was not exclusive, meaning the Spanish firm remains free to use other companies’ infrastructure. Telefonica will retain control over its operations, and its traffic will remain separate, he added. Aya said the agreement was part of a global trend to better position companies against rivals. “You need a lot of scale to compete in this business,” Aya said at an event in Mexico City. Telefonica has been outspoken about the difficulties it has faced in Mexico. Miguel Calderon, vice president of regulation at Telefonica Mexico, said the deal would ensure the firm remained in the country. The Spanish company has also complained about the cost of spectrum in Mexico, lobbying the government for a discount. After the deal with AT&T is complete, Telefonica will no longer need to pay for spectrum, driving down costs. Monica Aspe, vice president of external affairs for AT&T Mexico, described the accord as an innovative agreement between telecom companies. “What this agreement does is strengthen the ability to compete,” she said.

-5.7964366995941745," Telefonica COO supports consolidation in Spanish telecom crowd BARCELONA (Reuters) - A top official at Telefonica said on Wednesday he would support consolidation in Spain’s fiercely competitive telecommunications market, where takeover speculation has been rife. The telecoms market in the euro zone’s fourth-largest economy has become ever-more crowded, squeezing profits and prompting British peer Vodafone to propose cutting up to one fifth of its workforce there. “We would be supportive of consolidation of the Spanish market if that scenario were to take place,” Chief Operating Officer Angel Vila told the Morgan Stanley European Technology, Media and Telecoms conference in Barcelona. “We have seen rumors in the press about other players,” Vila said, after a report last month that domestic challenger MasMovil planned to buy Vodafone’s Spanish business. Both companies denied that report. Already spoiled for choice with four national operators, Spaniards will soon be offered a fifth when regional operator Euskaltel realizes a plan to sell services under the Virgin brand. Vodafone Chief Executive Nick Read told the conference its restructuring in Spain had been painful but effective and offered advice on operating in that market to Telefonica and Orange, Europe’s No.3 provider. “They have to be rational, they have to find growth. In the mid to high end pricing needs to move up,” Read said, adding that Vodafone had already taken those steps. Telefonica posted 0.1% growth in organic core earnings in Spain in the third quarter, compared with a 1.6% drop in the previous three months. “The trends are very supportive and we are confident we can continue to achieve the best margins” on core earnings and operating cash flow, Vila said. Looking to Brazil, where Telefonica makes about a quarter of its core profit, Vila said cash-strapped carrier Oi had started a process to sell its mobile business and Telefonica would look at that. “This could be an interesting situation where there could be synergies,” Vila said."

The company said it planned to appeal the fine in Spain’s High Court, adding in a statement that it had detected “some biases” in the regulator’s investigation. The Spanish telecoms group, which owns telecommunications networks throughout the country, is obliged to share the grid with competitors at regulated rates and under terms set out by the CNMC. Telefonica was fined for delays, dating back to 2017 and 2018, on repairs when answering breakdowns on telecommunications networks rented to competitors, the CNMC said in a statement earlier on Thursday.

Reuters previously reported Oi was in talks with Telefonica and Italy's Telecom Italia TLIT.MI about a potential sale of its mobile network to avoid insolvency. “Lots of stars need to be aligned but it looks like this time they may actually align at some point,” Telefonica COO Angel Vila told a call for analysts, adding that such a deal could create value for Telefonica due to potential savings. Like other large telecoms firms in Europe, where it ranks fourth in the sector by market value, Telefonica is battling to find ways to boost profits in an increasingly crowded market. The company reported a 32% fall in third-quarter core profit earlier on Tuesday as one-off costs related to a lay-off plan in its struggling home market overshadowed solid results in Brazil and Britain. Telefonica’s shares slipped 1.7%, while the main Spanish stock market index was 0.2% lower. “Whilst group headline numbers are ahead of estimates we believe the focus will be on Spain where the recovery is much slower than what is needed to meet the management’s ‘soft’ guidance of a return to revenue and underlying growth for the financial year 2019,” Barclays analysts said in a report. Operating income before depreciation and amortization (Oibda) fell to 2.748 billion euros ($3.06 billion), missing an analyst forecast compiled by the company of 2.851 billion euros. The quarterly results were affected by 1.9 billion euros in one-off costs, mainly related to the lay-off plan in Spain announced in September and which aims to deliver annual cost savings of about 210 million euros from 2020. Telefonica reiterated its guidance for the year, saying it expected solid earnings in the fourth quarter to help it meet its target of 2% annual core earnings and revenue growth. Organic core earnings in Spain grew by just 0.1% for the quarter, amid tough competition from other operators, but accelerating from the previous quarter’s -1.6%. In Brazil, organic revenue growth was 2.6%, the highest in 15 quarters, mainly due to improvements at the group’s mobile business. Core earnings in Britain rose by 5.7%, while revenue climbed 4.1%, the company said. A 40% surge in free cash flow helped the group reduce overall net debt by 8.1% on year."

Europe’s third-biggest telecom company, like many peers, has been struggling to post strong growth in an increasingly crowded market and its share price has fallen 10% this year. After a board meeting where the proposals were discussed, Telefonica said in a statement it owned around 50,000 mast sites outside its main tower unit Telxius, and wanted both to share more infrastructure and “capitalize on interest in our infrastructure both from public and private market participants”. Communications masts have long been a popular investment for private equity firms because of their steady cash flows. Telefonica calculated those 50,000 sites could generate core earnings of around 360 million euros ($397 million). Telefonica said it aims to monetize a portfolio of these assets within the next 12 months and was considering options including selling to Telxius some of the sites held by other units. Last year, Telefonica sold a 10% stake in Telxius to Zara clothing chain owner Amancio Ortega for 378.8 million euros, as part of a drive to cut debt which was still more than 2-1/2 times core profit as of June. Employees over 53 years old in Spain would be eligible for early retirement, which would cost approximately 1.6 billion euros before taxes and allow savings worth around 220 million euros from 2021, the company said. The conditions of the early retirement plan are subject to negotiation with the unions and the two sides will meet on Wednesday. It said it also planned to double its training budget and teach new skills in areas including security, robotisation, analytics and web development to more than 6,000 employees.

0.38215540397342773," Britain's O2 to launch 5G mobile network in October LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s O2 mobile phone network, owned by Spain’s Telefonica, said on Thursday it would launch next generation 5G services in October, and will be live in 20 towns and cities by the end of the year and in 50 by next summer. Rivals EE and Vodafone have recently started 5G services, and Hutchison’s Three is set to follow in August. London, Belfast, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Leeds, London and Slough will be the first locations to benefit from the services, O2 said. Customers need to buy 5G compatible smartphones to use the ultrafast services, which typically currently offer speeds 20 times faster than 4G. O2 and Vodafone on Wednesday agreed to extend their network sharing agreement to help speed up the deployment of 5G. The deal enables the companies to share equipment, such as radio antennas, on joint network sites across the UK. The companies will have autonomy to install their own equipment at 25% of the sites while sharing the mast. In addition, they said they would press ahead with exploring potential monetization options for the joint venture, such as potential third-party investors. Vodafone Chief Executive Nick Read has stated he wants to make better use of the company’s masts across Europe by encouraging rival operators to use them or selling stakes in the infrastructure. Separately on Thursday British telecoms regulator Ofcom said it would open up more airwaves that had been licensed to mobile companies but which were not being used by them for local use by other parties. Ofcom’s spectrum group director Philip Marnick said: “Our new sharing approach will help more people access airwaves to create local networks around the UK.” “The benefits of this innovation could extend across our economy, from farms to factories, as well as supporting new technology firms.”"

-9.500956018169756," UPDATE 2-Telefonica sees Spain, services helping to meet 2019 guidance (Recasts with CFO quotes, details, shares) MADRID, May 10 (Reuters) - Spain’s Telefonica expects improvements in its home market, service revenues and more efficient use of digital technology to help boost earnings growth and meet full-year guidance, the company said on Friday. Large telecoms operators across Europe are battling to maintain growth in the face of strong competition from low-cost rivals, while at the same time investing heavily in next-generation mobile networks and fibre broadband. Telefonica said its revenue growth trend improved in the first quarter. Organic growth - adjusted for factors including foreign exchange rates, new accounting rules and capital gains - was 3.8 percent. First-quarter operating income rose 1 percent, and Chief Operating Officer Angel Vila reiterated revenue and margin growth guidance of about 2 percent over the full year. Europe’s third-largest telecoms operator by market value expects better growth in the second half, Vila told analysts on a conference call. That will be driven by improvements in the Spanish market, where revenue has risen for seven quarters in a row, as well as lower net content costs and “further efficiency in commercial channels” using automation and digitalisation, he said. Chief Executive Jose Maria Alvarez Pallete said in February that the company’s 2019 guidance was “prudent” and implied margins would remain stable. Telefonica’s main European competitors are Deutsche Telekom , Vodafone and France’s Orange. Adjusted operating income before depreciation and amortisation (OIBDA) rose 1 percent on an organic basis to 4.26 billion euros ($4.79 billion) in the first quarter, Telefonica said earlier. Shares rose after the results were announced, but fell back by late morning to change hands for 7.12 euros, a whisker below their opening level and broadly in line with the overall market. OIBDA was up 10.3 percent on a reported basis partly due to new accounting rules. Underlying OIBDA came in at 3.730 billion euros, compared with a 3.739 billion euro average of analyst estimates provided by the company. The new accounting rule changes the treatment of leases for assets such as phone masts, arrangements that telecoms firms often rely on to manage their networks. Telefonica said it had shaved 1.7 percent off a debt pile built from heavy investment in its networks, leaving it at 40.4 billion euros, calculated to reflect the new accounting rules."

The proposal would not lead to a single additional broadband cable being laid in Germany, Deutsche Telekom added, saying it could even slow work to build out super-fast fiber-optic networks - a government priority."

-8.551874591763445," Telefonica launches open-access mobile internet in Peru LIMA (Reuters) - Spanish telecommunications group Telefonica said on Monday that it was launching open-access, wholesale broadband mobile internet service in Peru aimed at expanding coverage in rural areas. The operator, Internet para Todos Peru (IpT), will also be backed by Facebook, the private investment arm of the Inter-American Development Bank and the Development Bank of Latin America, Telefonica said. Telefonica, the largest internet provider in Peru, said that if successful, the project’s business model can be replicated across Latin America to deliver mobile broadband to millions of people who live in remote areas. The announcement follows Mexico’s launching of a wholesale national mobile network - Red Compartida - last year. Telefonica said IpT will offer wholesale access to its broadband infrastructure that will allow any mobile operator to provide services in rural communities. Open-access technology and a revenue-sharing model will keep costs low, it added. The company said it hopes the project will help show that business models that embrace open-access principles can deliver “reasonable financial returns.” “About 100 million people, 20 percent of the Latin American population, do not yet have widespread access to mobile broadband,” Telefonica said in an emailed statement."

The company, which reported an 18 percent core profit rise in 2018, wants to buy controlling stakes and has said there are different options to finance the new investments, including raising capital from shareholders. ConnecT, main shareholder of Cellnex with a 29.9 pct stake, has stated that it will support the company’s growth strategy. “Cellnex will buy something new. We hope this year we will buy something,” said on Friday Cellnex chief financial officer Jose Manuel Aisa.

European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager has taken a tough line against companies breaching procedural rules or pledges and levied million-euro fines against companies including Facebook in recent years. The European Commission on Friday said it had sent a statement of objections, or charge sheet, to Telefonica, giving the company until April 5 to respond. Telefonica could be fined up to 10 percent of its German subsidiary’s global turnover if found guilty of breaking its pledge. The EU competition enforcer had waved through the 8.6 billion euro ($9.8 billion) E-Plus deal after Telefonica agreed to sell some radio spectrum and rent out capacity on its network to smaller rivals. The company did what it had promised with one exception. “The Commission’s preliminary view is that Telefonica did not properly implement its obligations under the wholesale 4G access obligation,” the EU executive said. It said this restricted the ability of third parties to compete in the German mobile telephony market. This is the first case where a company broke its merger pledge, the Commission said. Telefonica said it had complied with its promise. “We are confident that we can dispel the Commission’s current concerns,” the company said in a statement.

Chief Executive Jose Maria Alvarez Pallete said 2018 results, along with “remarkable operating momentum in the initial months of 2019, allow us to announce with confidence our 2019 targets”, as well as a 0.40 euro cash dividend. The targets imply revenue and core profit growth, stripping out currency effects and other one-offs, will be close to or slightly lower than the 2.4 percent and 3.5 percent registered in 2018. However, the company raised its revenue target last October. Shares rose 1.4 percent after the results, before subsiding to around 0.5 percent higher at 0845 GMT. Telefonica, which has invested billions of euros in high-speed networks to carry bells-and-whistles packages including pay-TV, said it had boosted the share of its revenue from services beyond traditional connectivity to 15 percent. It also pledged to make gross savings of over 340 million euros ($386 million) in the course of the year, and spend around 15 percent of sales on investments not including spectrum. Plunging currencies in Brazil, where Telefonica makes about a quarter of its core profit, and other Latin American countries that account for a further 20 percent, have dragged on earnings in recent quarters. Operating income before depreciation and amortisation came in at 15.57 billion euros ($17.7 billion) in 2018, helped by improving margins at its British and Brazilian operations. The impact of currency effects, restructuring and other one-offs meant this translated into a 3.8 percent drop, on the back of 48.7 billion euros in revenue, which in reported terms was a 6.4 percent fall. Spain’s fourth-biggest company said the growth forecasts assumed constant exchange rates everywhere apart from Venezuela and excluded adjustment for hyperinflation in Argentina. Telefonica shaved a further 5.5 percent in 2018 off the debt it piled up through its network investment, leaving it with debt equivalent to less than three times its core earnings.

It is the first time that Telefonica has led the market in adding customers for broadband and mobile, according to Spanish regulator CNMC. Telefonica and Orange both sweetened their offers during the summer to attract Vodafone’s 400,000 Spanish television subscribers who pay for football add-ons, but the French operator lost almost 11,000 mobile clients in August. Bundled telecom offers, a popular package in Spain, usually consist of two mobile lines, broadband fixed line and television. This would indicate some 45,000 of Telefonica’s new subscribers signed up for the high-end service. “We expect Telefonica to add around 150,000 broadband subscribers in the next 18 months with around 90 euros ARPU (average results per user)”, said Credit Suisse in a report in September. ARPU is a closely watched gauge of telecom companies’ profitability. A hefty price tag of almost 4 billion euros ($4.55 billion) for the soccer rights put the company under pressure to attract enough new customers to justify the investment.

The partnership will save money for market leader Telekom which it can invest in upgrading its network while helping No.3 player Telefonica get its mobile infrastructure 5G-ready, the companies said. “We will invest the resources that we save in further building out our network infrastructure and in the development of 5G,” Telekom CEO Dirk Woessner said in a statement on Monday. The alliance comes as Germany finalises terms for its first auctions of 5G spectrum in early 2019, frequencies that would support uses such as connected factories. Established operators are concerned that potentially onerous auction terms, and calls by some lawmakers and regulators for terms conducive to the entrance of a fourth operator, could hurt their ability to invest. Germany’s federal network regulator has also left open the possibility of various forms of cooperation on 5G networks between operators to ensure that coverage across Germany can be as broad as possible. Telefonica has a mobile-led strategy, leaving it at a relative disadvantage to Telekom and No.2 player Vodafone in providing 5G services. These require extensive fibre-optic networks to ensure the high data speeds and low latency needed for applications like self-driving cars. “By using the available infrastructure, we can accelerate the expansion of our mobile network and get a significant portion of our mobile base stations in shape for the future 5G standard,” said Telefonica CEO Markus Haas.

Ortega’s family-run holding Pontegadea will pay 378.8 million euros ($440.4 million) in a deal which will help Telefonica to keep chipping away at a debt pile that was more than 2-1/2 times its core profit at the end of last year. Telefonica said the sale, which values Telxius shares at around 19 percent more than private equity firm KKR agreed to pay for a stake last February, would also contribute to maintaining sustainable returns for shareholders. Mast firms have traditionally been a popular target for private equity firms because of their steady cash flows. Ortega’s investment will sit in his portfolio alongside prime commercial real estate in top-end shopping and office districts in cities including London, New York and Madrid. The 82-year-old billionaire uses dividend income from his majority stake in Zara owner Inditex to invest in commercial real estate. Pontegadea groups a 50.01 percent stake in Inditex alongside nearly 9 billion euros worth of property. Ortega has bought into listed companies in the past, including a stake in NH Hotel Group, which he sold four years ago.

After having invested billions in high-speed networks, Telefonica is offering premium content to capture lucrative pay-TV customers, but also going back to basics with low-cost phone and internet offers to compete with cheaper rivals such as MasMovil and Orange’s Jazztel. The Spanish company’s operating income before depreciation and amortisation (OIBDA) came in at 8.1 billion euros ($9.50 billion), compared with 8.18 billion euros last year. Its net profit rose to 1.74 billion euros from 1.6 billion euros a year earlier. Devaluating currencies in Brazil, Telefonica’s second-largest market after Spain, other Latin American countries and Britain, squeezed its earnings. The company maintained its target for a rise of around 1 percent in revenue this year, but is expected to boost its OIBDA margin by half a percentage point. Dividends will remain unchanged at 0.40 euros per share, Telefonica said."

Telefonica invested 107 million euros to get 50 MHZ in spectrum, Orange paid 132 million euros for 60 MHZ and Vodafone paid 198 million euros for 90 MHZ. 5G is more than 20 times faster than 4G and it is expected to boost the “internet of things”, which describes a wide-range of objects that are connected to the internet and can collect and exchange data to perform functions such as operating autonomous vehicles, controlling the heating at home, managing maintenance in factories or monitoring energy consumption.

-10.508091345766525," Spanish telecom company disputes merger of Argentine competitors BUENOS AIRES, July 24 (Reuters) - Spanish telecoms company Telefonica has taken legal action against the merger of Argentine companies Cablevision and Telecom Argentina, saying the combination would cause unfair competition. The merger was approved by Argentine regulators last month. “Telefonica has already started the necessary legal action to fight the decision, which we consider unjust and discriminatory,” the company said in a statement late on Monday. “We are analyzing all the international tools at our disposal to defend our rights,” it said. Telefonica also said the merger endangered investment in the sector, and will have serious consequences for the future of Argentina’s telecom industry. The deal was allowed after market-friendly President Mauricio Macri loosened regulations in 2017 to widen internet penetration in the country and allow local providers to integrate phone, TV, internet and wireless services.

-11.600947582628558," Telefonica goes back to basics in Spain with O2 brand MADRID, June 12 (Reuters) - Spain’s Telefonica said on Tuesday it would start selling low-cost phone and internet services in its key domestic market, in a shift away from its recent focus on pricy premium packages. Telefonica will launch the O2 brand it sells in Britain in September in Spain, where it makes a third of its core earnings but was hit by the euro zone’s economic crisis. Fierce competition on its Movistar brand from cheaper rivals MasMovil and Orange’s Jazztel has squeezed domestic market share for Telefonica, Spain’s fifth-biggest company. Until now it has responded by investing billions of euros in high-speed networks and aiming upmarket with its Movistar Fusion bundled package of super-fast internet, premium TV and mobile and fixed phone services. The O2 offer will not include TV, and will cost around half the 87.8 euros ($104) Fusion customers fork out every month. “We understand that this model was not sufficiently covered by Movistar,” Pedro Serrahima, director of Telefonica’s multi-brand strategy, told a news conference."

-9.716231854025935," UPDATE 1-ECB sells second O2-Telefonica bond which broke its own rules (Adds details) FRANKFURT, April 16 (Reuters) - The European Central Bank said it had sold another O2-Telefonica bond last week after realising it broke the rules of the stimulus programme under which it was bought. The bond, purchased by the Bundesbank a year ago and due to mature in 2021, was removed on Monday from an ECB list of more than 1,000 corporate issues bought by central banks as part of their efforts to boost euro zone inflation. The sale took place just after a sharp fall in the price of the bond, suggesting investors might have been anticipating the ECB move after it shed its other O2-Telefonica bond in late March for the same reason. Critics of the ECB’s credit-buying programme say that it is too risky for a central bank and outside its area of expertise. Both bonds were retrospectively deemed in breach of the ECB’s rules because they offer a “step up” coupon, which increases if the telecoms company is taken over and the credit-worthiness of its guarantor downgraded. The ECB is only allowed to buy bonds whose payouts are either pre-determined or track an index, such as Euribor or inflation. It is the fourth time the ECB has been forced to sell a bond after spotting a rule breach, with previous cases involving debt issued by French chemical group Arkema and Belgian mobile telecoms provider Proximus.
