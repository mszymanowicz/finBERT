9.778273561841425," Groceries, gowns and Coca-Cola: Jason Wu sets up shop at New York Fashion Week (Reuters) - Lockdown cooking and casual clothing inspired designer Jason Wu’s Autumn-Winter 2021 collection, which his models paraded live at New York Fashion Week on Sunday evening. The creations were dished out in his 1950s-inspired “Mr. Wu’s General Store” between rows of fresh produce set up in an empty Broadway shopfront. “During this past year, cooking has proven to be an amazing outlet for me creatively,” the Taiwanese-Canadian designer, 38, said in a statement. “The joys that I experience from cooking and spending time with loved ones make me hopeful to celebrate the moments that really matter. This show represents who I am, not only as a designer but as a person.” The edible ingredients were donated to City Harvest, a New York charity fighting food insecurity, after the show, one of the few live events in this year’s Fashion Week. Wu, who founded his eponymous label in 2007 and rose to global fame as the designer of the gown worn by former first lady Michelle Obama to her husband’s first inauguration ball in 2009, has been documenting his pandemic-time cooking in a diary on his Instagram account “MrWuEats”. In line with his 1950s Americana theme, Wu also partnered with Coca-Cola, diving into the U.S. brand’s archives to unearth prints, logos and styles. “These logos bring that multicultural aspect to the collection and a nod to what America means to me - a melting pot of diverse cultures,” Wu said. The show featured loose-fitting long dresses and skirts, combined with knitted sweaters and long masculine coats. Red and blue popped out against whites, black and greys. Long fringes and boots in yellow snakeskin and pink patent leather lightened up more somber styles."
9.778273561841425," Coca-Cola's European bottler sweetens takeover offer for Aussie peer Amatil (Reuters) - The European bottling arm of Coca-Cola has sweetened its final, binding takeover offer for Australian counterpart Coca-Cola Amatil by 75 cents per share, reflecting a jump in the company’s market value since an initial offer last year. Coca-Cola European Partners (CCEP) said on Monday it was raising the offer by 6% to A$13.5 per share, valuing the Australian company at A$9.93 billion ($7.70 billion). Shares in Coca-Cola Amatil, which have been gaining steadily since CCEP’s initial offer was made public in October, hit an eight-year high of A$13.41 in response. Coca-Cola has long outsourced its bottling operations to separate regional operators. It owns 31% of Amatil and 19% of CCEP, which is now by far the largest by revenue, serving 13 countries in Western Europe. While the deal would unite two companies that bottle and distribute Coca-Cola drinks, providing scale, operating efficiencies and a larger geographic spread, it also provides CCEP with a platform for further consolidation in Asia. Amatil said it backs the offer, which would be Australia's biggest deal this year and comes after reports here that its major shareholders viewed the earlier offer of A$12.75 per share as too low. The company’s preliminary full-year results in January forecast 2020 earnings before interest and taxes of A$550.7 million, 10% ahead of expectations, while also slashing debt, on the back of a strong Christmas in Australia and New Zealand. Monday’s offer is subject to an independent expert concluding that the offer is “fair and reasonable”, but Jefferies analysts said CCEP was likely to seal the deal. “We do not see a superior proposal emerging given the integrated nature of the franchise system,” the brokerage’s analyst Edward Mundy said. CCEP said it would buy out 10.8% of Coca-Cola’s stake in Amatil in cash, but has not yet made any decision on acquiring the rest. ($1 = 1.2890 Australian dollars)"
11.62710213339091," Coca-Cola turns to 100% recycled plastic bottles in U.S. (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co will sell its popular sodas in bottles made from 100% recycled plastic material in the United States, the beverage maker said on Tuesday, in a major shift to combat plastic waste and reduce its carbon footprint. The soda and beverage giant, criticized for being one of the biggest producers of plastic waste, pledged a couple of years ago to collect and recycle a bottle or can for each one it sells globally by 2030. The company will start rolling out the new 13.2oz bottles of Coke, Diet Coke, Coke Zero Sugar, Coca-Cola Flavors this month in select states in the Northeast, Florida and California. The Atlanta, Georgia-based firm said the new recycled bottles would help reduce its use of new plastic by more than 20% across its North American portfolio compared with 2018. “We realize our unique opportunity and clear responsibility to make a positive difference in the global plastic crisis,” said Alpa Sutaria, the company’s vice president, Sustainability, North America Operating Unit. Beginning this month, 20oz bottles of the beverages will be sold in California and New York, and in Texas by Spring, as well as its Dasani and Smartwater brands in some locations in the coming months. Sprite will come in a new 13.2oz clear bottle packaging in select markets this month and will transition all packaging to clear bottles by the end of 2022. Nestle and PepsiCo, among the top polluters, have also taken steps to redesign packaging and reduce waste."

10.76326243821252," Coca-Cola's South African bottler to increase black ownership stake to 20% JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Beverages South Africa (CCBSA) will increase the stake held by employees and black empowerment investors in the company to 20%, it said on Friday, in a bid to meet merger conditions laid out by competition authorities. In 2014, the Coca-Cola Company and SABMiller Plc reached an agreement with the majority shareholder of a company which bottled Coca-Cola’s products to combine the bottling operations of their non-alcoholic beverages businesses in Southern and East Africa, which led to the creation of CCBSA’s parent company. The parent company is Coca-Cola Beverages Africa. The merger required the parties to increase black empowerment ownership of CCBSA, a government rule meant to reverse decades of economic exclusion of black people under apartheid. Companies in South Africa are required to meet rules of a scheme called Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) which allows black employees and investors to hold equity in the company. This makes a company more likely to qualify for government tenders. The deal will see nearly 8,000 employees increase their current holding of around 5% in CCBSA to an approximate 15% shareholding, CCBSA Managing Director, Velaphi Ratshefola and Minister of Trade, Industry and Competition Ebrahim Patel said in a joint statement. Adding to the company’s external BEE partners, the combined equity stake will be 20%, Patel said. In June the company said every employee will receive an equal allocation of shares regardless of staff level, race or years of service. CCBSA, a bottler for the Coca-Cola Company, will also be contributing 80 million rand ($5.39 million) per year for three years to the government’s localisation initiatives. “We have also undertaken to collaborate with our sugar suppliers to increase the volume of sugarcane procured from black farmers,” Ratshefola added.

Esta afirmación es falsa: si se realiza correctamente, los test de COVID-19 no darán un resultado positivo con Coca-Cola. Ejemplos de mensajes sosteniendo esta afirmación se pueden ver aquí ( here , here ). La descripción de una de las publicaciones dice: “El refresco más popular del mundo (Coca-Cola) dio positivo en la prueba de COVID ante los ojos del Parlamento. Ustedes permitieron que el Gobierno les quitara casi un año de sus vidas junto con las libertades. Enlace en comentarios”. La mayoría de las publicaciones incorporan capturas de un video del discurso pronunciado por Schnedlitz en el parlamento austriaco el 10 de diciembre de 2020 (here). El video, publicado por el propio Schnedlitz (here), explica que llevó a cabo un test de antígenos rápido para detectar COVID-19 en un vaso de Coca-Cola ante los miembros del parlamento. El político sostiene que la prueba dio un resultado positivo y por lo tanto constituye una prueba de que los tests masivos de COVID-19 no tienen valor, como se puede leer en los subtítulos de una de las publicaciones que comparten el video aquí (here). Dialab, la compañía que fabricó el test rápido de antígenos, se refirió al video en sus páginas de Facebook y YouTube ( here , youtu.be/CMcUzvrn75E ). El test del video de Schnedlitz y el de Dialab parece ser el mismo, ambos con una cara inferior de color azul oscuro. Dialab explica en sus publicaciones que Schnedlitz realizó la prueba de manera incorrecta, lo que dio lugar a un resultado positivo. La empresa mostró en sus videos cómo realizar la prueba correctamente con Coca-Cola, lo que arroja un resultado negativo. En la descripción del video de YouTube se explica que la muestra, en este caso de Coca-Cola, no fue removida con el tampón incorporado en el test, lo cual es esencial para mantener el valor de pH constante a fin de realizar la prueba correctamente. Cuando la muestra no se revuelve, las proteínas de los anticuerpos de la prueba se destruyen, mostrando el marcador positivo. “Este resultado también sería de esperar en el test de cualquier otro fabricante con una aplicación de este tipo”, explica Dialab en su video de YouTube. “Si hubiera utilizado la prueba correctamente, como se describe en el prospecto, la prueba sería negativa”. Dialab recomienda que este tipo de pruebas sean realizadas siempre por profesionales capacitados para evitar resultados falsos. El uso del tampón es uno de los pasos en las instrucciones de los tests de varias organizaciones y fabricantes (aquí: here , here y here ). Falso.

The company, which bottles and sells Coca-Cola KO.N drinks in 28 countries, on Wednesday posted sales of 1.83 billion euros ($2.16 billion), above a consensus here of 1.79 billion euros. HBC’s at-home channel, which contributes nearly 60% of HBC’s revenue, grew by mid-single digits in the quarter, while business consumption also improved, HBC said.

-1.9829286869334015," Take a stance or tiptoe away? Corporate America's battle with social activism (Reuters) - Earlier this year, a flood of major U.S. companies pledged to address racial inequality and promote social justice after Minneapolis police killed George Floyd, a Black man, setting off protests across the country. Companies that rushed to take a stand include household names like Home Depot Inc, Procter & Gamble Co and Coca-Cola Co. Corporate America pledged billions to promote diversity in employee ranks and the communities in which they operate, including banks like JPMorgan Chase & Co, which recently made a $30 billion commitment over the next five years. Another set of companies, particularly in Silicon Valley, are turning more cautious, according to interviews with more than a dozen investors, entrepreneurs, executive coaches and recruiters. Companies and employees should avoid taking public stances that stoke controversy in an increasingly polarized America, proponents of this view and their advisers told Reuters. Instead, they should focus on strategic initiatives and meeting financial targets, they said. Management teams and boards of directors are discussing how to handle the issue, sources said, with some staying silent as a strategy and others laying out formalized ground rules detailing how executives can discuss sensitive social and political issues. “People are struggling with employees expecting companies to solve problems that are beyond the purview of the company,” said executive coach Stephen Miles of the Miles Group. Miles has spoken to at least 10 CEOs in recent weeks who commiserated with Brian Armstrong, the chief executive of Coinbase, whose Sept. 27 blog post explaining why the cryptocurrency company would remain apolitical brought the debate into the public square. (Blog: bit.ly/2IG9BMm) Coinbase and its employees should pay attention to the corporate “mission” and not delve into broader societal problems that distract and decrease productivity, Armstrong wrote. The company declined to comment further for this story. After he shared it on Twitter, some founders and former senior executives of prominent tech companies replied supportively. The view may be shared even more widely in corporate America than it appears. “People aren’t taking a public stand about this, but they are asking about it in the boardroom: ‘What should we do?’” said Kathleen Utecht, managing partner at venture-capital firm Core Innovation Capital. Utecht agrees with Armstrong. His position is more common than people may realize, she said, especially at smaller companies where management teams do not want to devote limited resources to fixing complex societal issues. The unprecedented outpour of corporate support for racial justice lately follows several years of companies taking a stand on other issues that activists criticize them about, including climate change, the gender wage gap and LGBTQ rights. Blue-chip corporations have not wavered from their announcements and smaller companies have taken a stand, too. On Friday, Expensify CEO David Barrett emailed the software company’s 10 million users urging them to vote for Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden. These declarations get attention, partly because of how unusual they are historically, said Harvard University professor Mike Toffel, who has studied CEO activism. It is more common now than it was five or 10 years ago, but still rare, he said, and the feeling that companies should get involved in politics is far from universal. “You can count on a couple of hands how many examples you can find,” he said. “Many are not engaging.” Roughly half of the companies in the Russell 1000 did not make statements about racial inequality last summer, according to preliminary data from As You Sow, a nonprofit that advocates for corporate accountability. Of those that did make statements, 195 were in hard-to-find locations like a CEO’s LinkedIn page or staff Facebook page, not the corporate website, said Andrew Behar, As You Sow’s chief executive. Lloyd Carney, a former tech executive who sits on the boards of companies including artificial intelligence provider Nuance Communications Inc, said “smart” companies are taking steps to address social causes internally, but not in a splashy way. That allows them to avoid backlash from employees, customers or politicians, he said. “It’s one of those things where it’s better to make quiet noise,” said Carney. “A press release is the worst thing you can do in this highly politicized environment.” About half a dozen companies outside Silicon Valley recently set up “guardrails” for how executives can discuss sensitive social and political issues, like Black Lives Matter, one adviser to boards told Reuters. Executives must make it clear that they are speaking in a personal capacity on certain issues and notify boards about their comments, the adviser said. For instance, high-tech manufacturer Sono-Tek Corp adopted a similar code of conduct in September that forbids employees from participating in politics on the job or with company resources. The provision is especially important in today’s tumultuous world and is meant to help employees feel comfortable at work, said the company’s chief financial officer, Steve Bagley. “Large businesses want people to buy their product, to support their company, whether they are hardcore Democrats or hardcore Republicans, or in between,” said Ronn Torossian, head of 5W Public Relations, who talks to CEOs across a wide swath of industries. “A week doesn’t pass that major companies aren’t discussing this.”"
-0.24804163080189512," Coca-Cola's European partner makes $6.6 billion play for Australia bottler SYDNEY/BENGALURU (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co’s European bottler has made a A$9.28 billion ($6.6 billion) buyout approach to Australian peer Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd, a cut-price proposal that the target firm is backing due to uncertainty sparked by the coronavirus crisis. The takeover by Coca-Cola European Partners PLC (CCEP) would be the biggest involving Australia this year, but prices the target company below its market valuation in February - before the COVID-19 pandemic began to rock global markets and plunged the world into recession. The support from the Australians indicates expectations of an economic recovery that could take years, a bleaker view than that of some local economists who have pointed to improving economic indicators. Coca-Cola Amatil’s profit has been hit by shutdowns of restaurants and pubs since March. The deal would unite two companies that bottle and distribute Coca-Cola drinks, providing scale, operating efficiencies and a larger geographic spread. “Ultimately, when franchises become available, aligned Coke bottlers need to act,” said Jefferies analysts in a note, adding CCEP would be able to strengthen Amatil’s operational capabilities. “Longer term, the deal offers a platform for further consolidation in Asia.” Amatil’s shares closed up 16.3% at A$12.50, below the proposed offer price of A$12.75, indicating investors are factoring in the possibility a deal might not come to fruition. CCEP shares rose 8.5% in morning trade in London. The deal could lift CCEP’s earnings by 18% after three years, Jefferies said. “We are really confident about the recovery that the business is making (but) clearly there’s uncertainty over the next couple of years with the economic situation, and just the risk of further health outbreaks that could disrupt the business,” said Coca-Cola Amatil Chief Executive Alison Watkins on an investor call on Monday, when asked about the price. CCEP was formed by the 2016 merger of three European bottlers. It is now the largest bottler by revenue, operating in 13 countries including the United Kingdom, Germany and Spain. A spokesman for The Coca-Cola Co, which owns 31% of the Australian company and 19% of London-listed CCEP, said in an email the deal would be “in the best interests of the shareowners of both companies and of the Coca-Cola system overall”. The Australian company said CCEP would conduct due diligence before making a binding offer. The deal would also need approval from Australia’s Foreign Investment Review Board, which was granted increased powers this year to block overseas deals deemed to be a security or supply chain risk.

Declines in “away-from-home” sales eased to mid-teens range in the third quarter from about a 50% slump in April at the height of lockdowns, while demand for its trademark Coca-Cola and Coca-Cola Zero Sugar also rose. Coca-Cola makes about half of its revenue by selling its soft drinks at public venues and their closure had forced it to offer voluntary job cuts to about 4,000 workers in the United States. Chief Executive James Quincey said the situation is “dynamic”, as rising cases during the winter could result in regional lockdowns, adding the recovery in “away-from-home” sales had showed signs of getting stalled in September. “We don’t expect to return to the peak levels of global lockdown, but we are prepared for setbacks due to the local spikes in cases and targeted restrictions and closures,” Quincey told analysts. The company said consumers were buy more sparkling soft drinks and juices from grocery stores and online. “Coronavirus effects may linger for at least a couple of quarters, but we are seeing better progress than expected,” Edward Jones analyst John Boylan said. Rival PepsiCo Inc PEP.O too survived the lockdown-fueled slump with better sales at convenience stores and gas stations as well as good demand for snacks. Coca-Cola said it will cut the number of brands by half to about 200 and phase out products like ZICO coconut water and TaB sodas as part of its strategy to streamline beverage portfolio and focus more on popular products. On a per share basis, the Atlanta-based company earned 9 cents above expectations. Net revenue of $8.7 billion also beat estimates, according to Refinitiv data."

10.54805788461769," Social media deal earns advertisers' 'likes', but not yet all their dollars LONDON (Reuters) - Advertisers who boycotted social media are not all rushing back, despite an agreement by Facebook, YouTube and Twitter on how to curb harmful content online. Unilever, one of the world’s biggest advertisers, told Reuters the move this week was “a good step in the right direction,” but would not say whether it would resume paid advertising on Facebook in the United States next year after stopping over the summer. Coca-Cola also remains paused on Facebook and Instagram and declined to say if this changed its view. Beam Suntory, maker of Jim Beam bourbon and Courvoisier Cognac, plans to stay away from paid advertising for the rest of 2020 and reassess in 2021 based on how Facebook adjusts its approach. Over 1,000 advertisers joined a Facebook boycott over concerns it wasn’t doing enough to combat hate speech. U.S. civil rights groups enlisted multinationals to help pressure the social media giant after the June death of George Floyd, an American Black man, in police custody in Minneapolis. “Brands are very concerned about having any affiliation with the disinformation that runs through the big tech platforms,” said Michael Priem, CEO of advertising technology firm Modern Impact. Deciding whether to pull ads from social media can be tough. Larger brands can afford to take a stance, but for smaller businesses that have already been hurt by the coronavirus pandemic, “it’s either make it or die,” Priem said. On Wednesday, the World Federation of Advertisers announced that social media platforms and advertisers had committed to create common definitions of harmful content such as hate speech and harmonized reporting standards. A Facebook spokeswoman said on Friday that advertisers were returning to the platform. “For the most part advertisers are coming back because they recognize the efforts we’re making,” the spokeswoman said. “We’re never satisfied. We’ll continue to work with industry and with our clients.” She said that 95% of the hate speech removed by Facebook is detected before being reported, up from 23% in 2017. “Digital media is now more than half of all media spending yet is still operating with very few boundaries other than those that are self-imposed or that marketers try to enforce. It’s time for digital platforms to apply content standards properly,” Procter & Gamble’s chief brand officer, Marc Pritchard, said on Wednesday. The maker of Gillette razors and Pampers diapers said it will “continue to advocate for greater transparency, reporting, and enforcement” directly with platforms and through industry forums. Many companies, such as drinks giant Pernod Ricard, returned to Facebook in August after a one-month pause aimed at sending a message. “I feel very happy ... with the outcome. I think it worked,” said Eric Benoist, global marketing director for the maker of Absolut vodka and Martell Cognac. “It was a wake-up call. They heard it loud and clear.” Some advertisers, like spirits group Diageo, came back following direct engagement with the platform and evidence of action. “Some progress has been made, but more needs to be done and we think we’re better able to bring about change by working together,” a Diageo spokeswoman said. “We are in the process of resuming paid media and will continue to drive accountability on these pressing issues.” Campaign organizers remain skeptical and pledged to keep up the heat. “We cannot assume progress from yet another commitment to change until we see the impact and breadth of policy enforcement by these companies,” said Rashad Robinson, president of Color Of Change, a backer of the Stop Hate for Profit campaign, which organized the boycott. “As long as these companies continue to abdicate their responsibility to their most vulnerable users, we will continue to call on Congress and regulatory agencies to intervene.”"
6.207089808295276," Coca-Cola bottlers are feeling flat, even as U.S. grocery sales sparkle CHICAGO/LONDON (Reuters) - Martin Williams’ great-grandfather founded their Coca-Cola distribution business in Corinth, Mississippi, in 1907, just a handful of years after Coke was first sold in bottles across the United States. He’s part of the fourth generation to run it, and he’s determined not to be the last. Williams’ business is one of nearly 70 U.S. Coca-Cola “bottlers” - third-party, independent companies that put Coke and other beverages into cans and bottles and deliver the drinks to retailers and restaurants in every corner of the country. The future of such companies is not only critical for their owners and employees, but also key for their main supplier - Coca-Cola, the world’s No.1 soft drink maker - which needs them to flourish to help it recover from a slump in sales. But COVID-19 has upended their business models. “It was chaos. You just had no idea what the world was going through and what we were up against,” said Williams, the finance head of his family’s firm. “It’s on our shoulders to try to take our business forward into the future and to maintain the work that our ancestors have done.” Shoppers in lockdowns snapped up cases of Coke, Fanta and Sprite at grocery stores rather than at gas stations, restaurants and stadiums. That left bottlers scrambling to keep stores stocked with bigger, often less-profitable packages. Lucrative sales to restaurants and convenience stores are still only a fraction of what they were before the pandemic hit the United States. The bottlers - now saddled with too much product meant for restaurants - have also been hit by a shortage of aluminum cans due to a surge in demand for canned drinks as people stay home. Williams, whose business distributes rather than makes drinks, has adapted to this new order over the last six months, while grappling with higher costs for fuel, transportation, labor, safety gear and cleaning products. Pressures have eased since the lockdown, but his firm is still affected. (Graphic: Coca Cola bottlers by volumes sold in 2019 vs 2016 - ) Coca-Cola sells syrups, powders and base ingredients - known as concentrates - to bottlers, who mix, package and sell drinks to retailers, giving a cut back to the soda giant. The company works with many large publicly listed bottlers around the world, including in Europe and Asia. But many U.S. players are small, family-owned businesses, with limited reserves to draw from as sales and profits shrink. About two-thirds of them received pandemic aid from the U.S. government to keep in hand or stay afloat, which is important for Coca-Cola to increase its own sales. All the while Coca-Cola, with whom they have a symbiotic relationship, has also been under intense pressure. The drinks giant’s volume sales in North America declined 16% in the latest quarter. Nearly 40% of its over 10,000 employees in the region will decide by Thursday whether to volunteer for severance as part of a sweeping restructuring. “It was a very difficult time throughout April and May, in particular, and our bottlers have to deal with that on a regular basis,” Chaly Moyen, Coca-Cola’s North America head of strategy, told Reuters. As lockdowns have eased, worldwide volume declines have moderated, from about 25% in April to about 10% in June. She declined to say whether Coca-Cola would bail out any bottlers close to going bankrupt. Coca-Cola is the U.S. leader in fizzy drinks - excluding tea, water and energy drinks - with about 38% of the $41.8 billion retail market, followed by PepsiCo and Keurig Dr Pepper, according to Euromonitor. While the food-service sales that make up about half of Coca-Cola’s business have dived, Moyen said North American sales to large stores have risen. At the height of the pandemic, they were up by a double-digit percentage versus a year earlier, and remain up by double-digits for 2020 so far, she added. However she acknowledged bottlers and distributors had been hit hard by the shifting retail landscape. “The impact that bottlers had from a mix shift was real,” Moyen said, adding that Coca-Cola expected the new consumer habits to stick. Selling less product has also hurt; in the quarter ended June 26, Coca-Cola sold 22% less concentrates worldwide as demand fell. Some bottlers have been forced to lay off or reassign workers specializing in supplying restaurants to bottling and distributing retail-friendly products, tasks in which they are not experienced, driving down productivity. Reyes Holdings, Coca-Cola’s second-biggest U.S. bottler, told Reuters it laid off 30 people - or about 6% of staff - at its Alsip facility in Illinois in April. As things improved, it reinstated half of those workers. Coca-Cola Consolidated, the biggest U.S. Coke bottler - last month reported a 3.6% fall in quarterly net sales. But the company, whose No.1 shareholder is Coca-Cola, increased adjusted operating income by 5.4%, after furloughing about 700 people without pay. Duane Stanford, publisher of the Beverage Digest newsletter, said such moves simply reflected the new business realities. “In this kind of environment it’s important to control costs – that absolutely comes with cutting jobs.”"

6.615674829588901," Coca-Cola to cut thousands of jobs as coronavirus hits sales (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co KO.N on Friday joined a list of big U.S. companies laying off thousands of workers in response to the coronavirus crisis, offering voluntary deals across its businesses and promising to halve its number of operating units. The company was offering voluntary redundancy to 4,000 workers in the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico and would offer similar deals in other markets, it said in a statement, while also signaling other layoffs were likely to follow. “The voluntary program is expected to reduce the number of involuntary separations,” the world’s largest beverage maker said, adding that the global severance programs would incur expenses of about $350 million to $550 million. The company, battling a hit to sales from closures of bars, restaurants and cinemas where it normally sells heavily, said it would have nine operating units that would sit under four geographical segments, along with global ventures and bottling investments divisions. Its current model includes 17 business units. The plan to cut jobs come at a time when the number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits hovered around 1 million last week, with the government confirming that the economy suffered its sharpest contraction in at least 73 years in the second quarter. United Airlines Holdings Inc UAL.O signaled on Thursday it was preparing the biggest pilot furloughs in its history, saying it needed to cut about 21% of total pilot jobs due to a slump in air travel. Cosmetics maker Estee Lauder Cos Inc EL.N and oilfield services giant Schlumberger NV SLB.N have in recent weeks announced that they would cut thousands of jobs. Coca-Cola last month reported a 28% slump in sales in the “most challenging” quarter of the year due to coronavirus-triggered closures of restaurants, theaters and sports venues.

The company, which bottles and sells Coca-Cola Co KO.N drinks in 28 countries, said comparable operating profit fell 35.8% to 208.8 million euros ($246.49 million) for the six months ended June 26, beating company-supplied consensus of 191.7 million euros. HBC said out-of-home volumes - which include sales at hotels, restaurants and cafes - during the initial weeks of lockdowns fell by 70%-90% but improved to declines of 25%-50% in May and June and 10%-40% in July. The company’s out-of-home channel typically accounts for slightly over 40% of its revenue. The Zug, Switzerland-based company said its retail sales improved since April, when performance was hit by some customer de-stocking. HBC said it expects a negative impact for 2020 due to weaker consumer environment and tourist season, as well as the risk of a second coronavirus wave.

6.768346645252652," Coca-Cola predicts recovery after 'most challenging' quarter (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co KO.N said on Tuesday demand for its beverages was improving after reporting a 28% slump in sales in the ""most challenging"" quarter of the year due to coronavirus-led closures of restaurants, theaters and sports venues. Shares of the world’s largest soda maker rose about 4% as it also beat second-quarter profit estimates. Coca-Cola generates a sizeable portion of its revenues by selling its soft drinks and concentrates to restaurants and theater operators, such as McDonald's Corp MCD.N and AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc AMC.N, but most of them had to close some or all of their operations due to the health crisis. But as lockdowns eased, unit case volume trends, a key demand indicator, improved sequentially, from a decline of about 25% in April to a fall of about 10% in June. Volume trends was down mid-single digits globally for July to-date. “We cannot discount there might be further waves of lockdowns, partial or full,” Chief Executive Officer James Quincey told analysts. “Having said that, I am pretty confident that second quarter will ultimately prove to have been the most difficult and the most impacted quarter.” Adjusted revenue fell to $7.18 billion in the three months ended June 26, while net income attributable to the beverage maker’s shareholders tumbled about 32% to $1.78 billion. “With the bar adequately lowered for Q2 in recent weeks... the exit rate for volume trends for June/start to July was naturally a key focus for investors,” Jefferies analyst Kevin Grundy said. Coca-Cola is expanding its digital presence through partnerships with third-party aggregators or by adding value bundles to restaurant menus as the pandemic prompts consumers to migrate to mobile delivery for groceries and prepared meals, Quincey said. On a per share basis, Coca-Cola earned 42 cents, beating analysts’ estimate by 2 cents."

James Phillips, the corporate vice president for Microsoft’s business applications group, told Reuters in an interview that Coca-Cola will use Microsoft technology to pull together information several internal systems, using artificial intelligence to fetch data from them and answer questions. In the first phase, Phillips said, Coke will offer the system internally to employees “rather than making the employee understand that you need to go over here to request vacation time, over there to look at your last payroll slip, or to some other system to understand what educational courses may be available.” Barry Simpson, senior vice president and chief information and integrated services officer of Coca-Cola, said in a statement that Microsoft’s software would help the company by “replacing previously disparate and fragmented systems.” Eventually, Microsoft’s Phillips said, Coca-Cola’s customer service agents plan to use system to help quickly answer questions from the beverage maker’s customers, which include major retailers and grocers."
4.955495808818856," Coronavirus lockdowns to hurt Coca-Cola's second quarter sales (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co KO.N said on Tuesday its expected current-quarter results to take a hit as restaurants, theaters and other venues that represent about half of the company's revenue remain closed because of the coronavirus pandemic. The soda maker's shares, a Dow 30 component .DJI, were down about 4%. They have lost about 16% so far this year. Coca-Cola makes syrups and concentrates and through its bottlers distributes them to fast-food chains, theaters, amusement parks and other venues, most of which have either closed all operations or limited their businesses. Several concerts and sporting events, including the company-sponsored Tokyo 2020 Olympics, have been postponed or canceled. As a result, volumes fell about 25% globally since the beginning of April, largely stemming from the loss of sales other than at retail stores, the company said. The hit to second-quarter results will be material, it said, though the ultimate impact on this quarter and the rest of the year is unknown at this time. Coca-Cola added it expected comparable revenue to include 4% to 5% hit from a stronger dollar. The Atlanta-based beverage maker said, however, it saw stockpiling in some markets and a sharp rise in e-commerce sales, as consumers rushed to buy goods in preparation for lockdowns. “It’s certainly not the case that e-commerce is offsetting the losses... E-commerce, even though it’s doubled in sales, for a beverage category, it’s still a very small percentage of the total beverage category,” Chief Executive Officer James Quincey told analysts. The rapid spread of the novel coronavirus, first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan last December, has claimed the lives of about 170,000 across the globe and has forced a wide range of businesses to shut doors. “We do know that our over 134 years of business, we’ve seen many types of crisis.... We are in a better position today than we were heading into previous periods of challenge,” Quincey said. For the first quarter, the soda maker reported better-than-expected revenue and profit, and said it expected conditions to start improving from mid-year. For the first quarter ended March 27, net revenue fell 1% to $8.6 billion. Analysts were expecting $8.28 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Excluding one-time items, Coke earned 51 cents per share, beating market consensus estimate of 44 cents.

1.8890712931893865," Bottling it? Plastic pollution from Coca-Cola, PepsiCo fuels emissions ROME (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Four of the world’s largest consumer brands are contributing to planet-heating emissions by using throwaway plastic to package everything from soft drinks and snacks to shampoo, said a report published on Tuesday. Coca-Cola, PepsiCo, Nestle and Unilever are responsible for half a million tonnes of plastic pollution annually in the six developing countries examined in the report released by international aid agency Tearfund. That is enough to cover 83 football pitches in a day, it said, calling the situation “morally indefensible”. Of the waste plastic, 60% is then burned by consumers on street corners, open dumps and in backyards, producing annual greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to 4.6 million tonnes of carbon dioxide - the same as “2 million cars on UK roads a year”, the charity added. Petrochemicals derived from oil and gas, which are carbon-rich fossil fuels, form the building blocks for plastic products. Globally, greenhouse gases in the atmosphere hit a new record high in 2018, reinforcing damaging weather patterns, the World Meteorological Organization said in November. An earlier 2019 report from UK-based Tearfund found that up to a million people die every year in poor countries from illnesses caused by discarded waste and plastic pollution. Of the four multinational companies in the new study, Coca-Cola is “by far the worst polluter”, responsible for emissions greater than the other three combined, as about 8 billion of its bottles are burned or dumped each year in the six countries, Tearfund said. In a statement, Coca-Cola said it was working to increase the use of returnable and refillable packaging, citing examples in five of the countries in the report - Brazil, India, Mexico, Nigeria and the Philippines - but did not mention China. The company was aiming for every plastic bottle to contain “at least 50% recycled plastic by 2030”, it said, adding that the Tearfund report “raises some serious issues”. PepsiCo, identified as the second-worst polluter, said it had set a target to decrease “virgin plastic content” across its beverage business by 35% by 2025. Nestle, the world’s biggest food company, said it was committed to making 100% of its packaging recyclable or reusable by 2025. Tearfund, however, said the brands should be doing more, adding that only consumer goods giant Unilever had committed to reduce its total plastic use, which the company said would amount to a decrease of more than 100,000 tonnes by 2025. Unilever also said in a statement it planned to help collect and process more plastic packaging than it sells by 2025."

HBC, the smaller of the two semi-independent bottlers, which bottles and sells Coca-Cola Co KO.N drinks in 28 countries, said demand in emerging markets like Nigeria and Romania helped operating profit rise 11.9% to 715.3 million euros ($777.75 million) for the year ended Dec. 31. “According to external forecasts for 2020, the economic outlook in our territories continues to be healthy and this we expect will support the final year of our 2020 plan,” the company said. It expects faster growth in its established and developing countries segments, which were affected by unfavorable weather in 2019.

-21.351591236176876," Coke, Fuze tea demand drive Coca-Cola's revenue beat, shares hit record high (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co's KO.N quarterly revenue beat market expectations on Thursday, driven by demand for the beverage maker's signature soda, flavored Cokes and Fuze teas, sending its shares up as much as 2.8% to a record high. The Atlanta-based company said fourth-quarter revenue growth was led by its trademark Coca-Cola, that included products such as caffeinated beverage Plus Coffee and Zero Sugar soda. Retail sales of its flagship brand rose 6%, Chief Executive Officer James Quincey said, adding that volumes in the brand were positive for the second straight year. The world’s largest beverage maker has been pushing into flavored sodas, coffees, teas and low-sugar beverages to attract consumers who move away from sugary drinks. The company is also expanding its portfolio and bought dairy company Fairlife earlier this month after spending about $5 billion to buy Costa Coffee last year. Credit Suisse analyst Kaumil Gajrawala found it reassuring that the group’s core product did well amid such expansion. “When the trademark Coke brand is up 6%... That’s one of the most positive indicators we have,” Gajrawala said. The group said innovative sodas helped its organic revenue, a keenly watched metric that excludes currency fluctuations and acquisitions, climb 7% during the quarter. Coca-Cola projected 2020 organic revenue growth to slow slightly to about 5% from a 6% rise it reported in 2019 and said it would continue focus on new categories through acquisitions. “That’s a pretty good indication that they feel good about the year so far... this would be seen as setting up a strong year,” industry expert and executive editor of Beverage-Digest, Duane Stanford, said. Volumes, a key indicator of demand, grew 3%, spurred by its Coca-Cola soda, with growth across all geographies. Volumes grew 4% for teas and coffee and 3% for sparkling soft drinks. For the year, Coca-Cola expects to record adjusted profit of $2.25 per share, just a cent below analysts’ forecast, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Excluding one-time items, Coca-Cola earned 44 cents per share in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, meeting Wall Street expectations. Net revenue grew 16% to $9.07 billion, beating analysts’ estimate of $8.89 billion. Net income attributable to the company’s shareholders rose to $2.04 billion, or 47 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $870 million, or 20 cents per share, a year earlier."

The Valor Economico newspaper said that the filing in a Brazilian court accused the Dutch brewer of designing a sale contract for Brasil Kirin with the intention of breaking the distribution contract it had with Coca Cola. However, Heineken said it understood the lawsuit from Coca-Cola Brasil and Brazilian Coke bottlers was not threatening the acquisition, which made it the number two player in the country, the world’s third-largest beer market. Last October, an arbitration tribunal decided Heineken must keep distributing its existing Kaiser products via the Coca-Cola network until March 2022, keeping the dates in the original contract. Heineken had wanted to sell its new and existing brands via its own distribution system. Heineken said on Sunday it had become aware of the lawsuit through public sources, but believed the suit was not aimed at annulling its 2017 acquisition of Kirin’s business in Brazil. Coca-Cola Brasil and the Brazilian Coke bottlers, it said were seeking compensation, for Heineken’s unwillingness to transfer its portfolio of beers bought with the Kirin acquisition to the Coke distribution system. The plaintiffs were challenging certain corporate actions of Heineken, but these actions did not impact the validity of its Brasil Kirin purchase. An arbitration tribunal had already addressed these issues, Heineken said. Heineken also said the lawsuit did not change its operations in Brazil, including distribution of its Kaiser brands via Coke distributors. Coca-Cola did not immediately comment on the matter.

-17.86746676631434," Diet Dr Pepper does not promise weight loss or deceive consumers: U.S. appeals court (Reuters) - A U.S. federal appeals court on Monday said the maker of Diet Dr Pepper did not deceive consumers into thinking the soft drink promoted weight loss by including “diet” in its name, a decision that could doom a similar lawsuit over Diet Coke. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals rejected California resident Shana Becerra’s claim that Dr Pepper/Seven Up, now part of Keurig Dr Pepper Inc, misled consumers, including through ads featuring physically attractive models, and that its conduct violated California consumer fraud laws. Becerra, who claimed to have struggled with obesity since childhood, relied on scientific evidence that she said linked aspartame, an artificial sweetener used in Diet Dr Pepper, to possible weight gain. But in a 3-0 decision for the San Francisco-based court, Circuit Judge Jay Bybee said Becerra failed to show that reasonable consumers associated diet soda with health benefits. “No reasonable consumer would assume that Diet Dr Pepper’s use of the term ‘diet’ promises weight loss or management,” Bybee wrote. “The use of ‘diet’ in a soft drink’s brand name is understood as a relative claim about the calorie content of that soft drink compared to the same brand’s ‘regular’ (full-caloric) option.” John Weston, one of Becerra’s lawyers, said he was disappointed with the decision. Evan Young, a lawyer for Dr Pepper/Seven Up, in an email said people who drink Diet Dr Pepper know it is a calorie-free version of Dr Pepper. “We appreciate that the Ninth Circuit has allowed common sense to prevail and that it rejected the attempt to complicate something that is so simple,” he added. Monday’s decision upheld an August 2018 dismissal by U.S. District Judge William Orrick in San Francisco. The 9th Circuit last week dismissed Becerra’s appeal in a similar case against Coca-Cola Co over Diet Coke, saying it lacked jurisdiction because the February 2018 dismissal by U.S. District Judge William Alsup in San Francisco was not final. Alsup would be expected to apply the reasoning in Monday’s decision if Becerra pursued the Diet Coke case. The federal appeals court in Manhattan earlier this year upheld dismissals of similar cases against Dr Pepper, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo Inc under New York consumer fraud laws. The case is Becerra v Dr. Pepper/Seven Up Inc, 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 18-16721."

4.719464018028591," Zero-sugar sodas, smaller soft drink cans drive Coca-Cola revenue beat (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co KO.N beat Wall Street estimates for quarterly revenue on Friday as customers took to smaller-sized cans of its sodas, including Coca-Cola Zero Sugar, prompting the beverage maker to give an upbeat forecast for 2019. Faltering demand for sugary drinks has forced the world's two largest beverage makers, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo Inc PEP.O, to roll out low-sugar drinks, while diversifying into coffee, tea and bottled waters to boost sales. Coca-Cola has also been rolling out new products such as Coca-Cola Plus Coffee, a blend of its trademark soda with coffee in more than 20 markets, as well as drinks in small but high-margin packs that are appealing to consumers who are turning more health conscious. The beverage maker is launching Coca-Cola Energy, its first Coke-branded energy drink, in the United States, and has expanded its coffee business with the multi-billion dollar purchase of Britain-based Costa Coffee last year. Volume in sparkling soft drinks rose 2% in the quarter, driven by double-digit percentage growth in Coca-Cola Zero Sugar and Sprite in North America. Strong growth was also seen in its smaller package drinks, led by double-digit growth in 7.5-ounce mini-cans. Organic revenue, that excludes the impact of currency fluctuations, acquisitions and divestitures, climbed 5% during the quarter, above the average analyst estimate of 4.3%, according to five analysts polled by Refinitiv. Shares of the Atlanta-based company rose 2% before the opening bell, adding to the 14% they have gained this year. “We were very impressed with Coca-Cola’s better-than-expected topline,” Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog said. Coca-Cola also said it now expects full-year organic revenue growth to be at least 5%, from its previous forecast of 5% growth. Overall, revenue rose 8.3% to $9.51 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 27, beating the average analyst estimate of $9.43 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Excluding items, Coca-Cola earned 56 cents per share, inline with estimates. The beverage maker maintained its full-year profit forecast even as it lowered its capital expenditure forecast for the year to about $2.2 billion from its prior target of about $2.4 billion. Earlier in the month, PepsiCo Inc PEP.O also reported better-than-expected quarterly profit and sales, benefiting from an advertising blitz and demand for its low-calorie beverages in North America."

4.257878855041283," Singapore to ban sugary drink ads in fight against diabetes SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore will ban advertisements of certain fizzy drinks and juices, its health ministry said on Thursday, part of a raft of measures to curb consumption of sugar in the city-state, which has some of the world’s highest diabetes rates. Under the measures, further details of which will be released next year, high-sugar drinks will also be required to bear health warnings on labels. Singapore’s action appears to go further than measures in other countries such as Mexico and Britain, which restrict when advertisements for high-calorie food and drinks can be shown on television to limit their exposure to children. “We will introduce an advertising prohibition of product advertisements for the least healthy SSBs on all local mass media platforms, including broadcast, print, out-of-home and online channels,” the health ministry said in a statement, referring to sugar-sweetened beverages. Singapore is also considering taxes on sugary drink makers and importers, and even a total ban on the sale of some beverages, the ministry said. The Coca-Cola Company, the world’s biggest beverage maker, said it welcomed the plans and would work to reduce sugar levels in its drinks sold in Singapore. “We will continue to rethink many of our recipes in Singapore to reduce sugar, because while sugar in moderation is fine, we agree that too much of it is not good for anyone,” said Ahmed Yehia, country manager for Coca-Cola Singapore and Malaysia. “We foresee minimal impact on our portfolio from this announcement,” he added. Singapore’s health ministry said it would consult consumers, drink makers and the advertising industry in coming months over the measures without giving a timeline for implementation. Wealthy Singapore has one of the highest rates of diabetes in the world, partly caused by its fast-ageing population and a culture of eating out at inexpensive hawker centers."

1.3058851934533453," Coca-Cola's coffee and zero sugar soda mix lifts 2019 goals, shares (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co KO.N beat second-quarter earnings expectations and raised its organic revenue forecast for the full year thanks to higher sales of its zero-sugar sodas, soft drinks with new flavors and ready-to-drink coffees. Shares in the Atlanta-based company rose nearly 6% in morning trading to hit $54.1, a record high. The world's biggest beverage makers, Coca-Cola and rival PepsiCo PEP.O, have been responding to changing consumer tastes by moving beyond traditional sodas and offering drinks that are lower in sugar or come in new flavors and in ready-to go packages. “Our performance was largely driven by consumer demand for no sugar versions of some of our best-known sparkling soft drink brands as well as for the a smaller packages for less sugar,” Chief Executive Officer James Quincey told analysts. PepsiCo’s results also beat analysts’ estimates earlier this month, boosted by demand for smaller packages of its traditional sodas. “The small packages are definitely a trend going forward... it’s a good thing when the category is strong, when there are innovations across all parties,” Edward Jones analyst John Boylan said. As part of his plan to create a “total beverage company”, Quincey has been looking beyond soda and last year clinched a deal to buy Britain-based Costa Coffee for $5 billion. The company is now betting on its coffee innovations, express vending machines, beans and machines for food service customers to grow sales. It recently rolled out ready-to-drink Costa Coffee in three varieties and Coke coffee, a beverage that blends coffee and its trademark soda, in several markets. Quincey said almost 25% of the company’s revenue is now from new or reformulated products, up from 15% two years ago. Coke Zero Sugar is now in its third year of double-digit volume growth, helped by smaller packaging and new flavors, the company said. It now expects organic revenues to grow 5% in the whole of 2019, up from its previous projection of an increase of about 4%. In the second quarter, a 4% volume growth in traditional Coca-Cola and its zero-sugar version helped net revenue rise 6.1% to $10 billion, a touch above analysts’ estimates. Organic revenue, a keenly watched metric that gives sales growth excluding acquisitions and currency fluctuations, rose 6%. Excluding one-time items, Coca Cola earned 63 cents per share, 2 cents above Wall Street’s estimates, according IBES data from Refinitiv. Nicholas Hyett, an analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown said the combination of global reach and a willingness to back new products were the key to the company’s success. “With market share improving again today, Coca-Cola’s still got plenty of fizz,” Hyett said."

The U.S. corporate earnings season is off to a strong start, with nearly 80% of the 104 S&P 500 companies topping earnings expectations in the second quarter. United Technologies Corp gained 0.3%, after raising its full-year profit and sales outlook. Fellow Dow component Coca-Cola Co shares rose as much as 5.8%, to hit a record high, after the fizzy drink maker beat quarterly earnings expectations and raised its full-year organic revenue forecast. “Coca-Cola posting very robust results is very encouraging and raises the prospects of stocks being able to perform in a changing environment,” said Mike Loewengart, vice-president of investment strategy at E*Trade Financial in New York. “The reaching of a debt ceiling agreement is positive news for all sectors at large, because it’s one additional question that gets removed from the outlook for growth and equities in general.” The deal will help avert a feared government default later this year, but add to rising budget deficits. The International Monetary Fund lowered its forecast for global growth this year and next, warning that more U.S.-China tariffs, auto tariffs or a disorderly Brexit could slow growth further.

The soda maker was in arbitration with Monster Beverage over the launch of Coca-Cola Energy, as it would put the company in direct competition with Monster and violate their initial agreement in 2015. Atlanta-based Coca-Cola launched the drink as a part of its efforts to break away from its traditional fizzy sodas and shift to health-focused trends. Coca-Cola Energy, first launched in Spain and Hungary in April, has caffeine from naturally derived sources, guarana extracts, B vitamins and no taurine - a stimulant often found in energy drinks. According to the ruling, the beverage maker can continue to sell and distribute Coca-Cola Energy, including in markets where it has already been launched, and is free to launch the product in new markets globally. Coca-Cola said it would continue its partnership with Monster, in which it holds a stake of nearly 19%. Shares of Monster fell 3% before the opening bell, while Coca-Cola’s shares rose marginally."
5.348628432343529," China Mengniu Dairy, Coca-Cola sign Olympic deal to 2032 LAUSANNE, Switzerland (Reuters) - China Mengniu Dairy and Coca-Cola have signed a multi-year global Olympic deal as joint beverages and dairy sponsors starting from 2021 until 2032, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) said on Monday. While some reports put a $3 billion price tag on the agreement, there were no financial details available and both Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey and Mengniu Chief Executive Jeffrey Lu refused to comment on the size of the deal. Coca-Cola’s previous deal ran to 2020 and the new agreement with China’s top milk products manufacturer, which will span six Olympic Games, makes it the longest Olympic sponsor, the U.S. drinks maker having first supported the Games in 1928. “It is a substantial arrangement. It is a profound partnership,” said Quincey. “With Mengniu, we saw an opportunity to expand the dairy aspect of the beverage category. “We will be activating our own individual marketing plans, but we are pleased to be a joint partner with a well-respected dairy company that is well known to us in China.” The two companies are already working together in some aspects of their business in China. The announcement is a major boost for the IOC, strengthening its financial future as interest in the world’s biggest multi-sports event has waned in the last few years. Mengniu is the latest Asian company to join as top sponsors after Bridgestone, Toyota and Alibaba in recent years and reflects the region’s growing influence of global business. “This long-term agreement is another demonstration of the relevance and stability of the Olympic Games in these times of uncertainty,” IOC President Thomas Bach said. His organization will later award the 2026 Winter Olympics to either Milan or Stockholm. Four other cities had pulled out of the bidding, fearful of the Games’ cost and size. Beijing will host the 2022 Olympics, while the Summer Games of 2024 will be staged in Paris. Los Angeles has been awarded the 2028 Olympics. Mengniu’s Lu said the agreement was a key part of their global vision. “This historic joint partnership deal, together with our global expansion plans, will help Mengniu promote our long-held values around quality and safety,” Lu added. “This is a vital step in our international strategy, and we are honored to have the opportunity to build the positive reputation of Chinese food and beverage brands among consumers globally.”"

The U.S. beverage giant had wanted to refranchise the unit as part of its global plan to divest its manufacturing and distribution assets to focus on main beverage business and boost margins. “While we remain committed to the refranchising process, we believe it’s in the best interests of all involved for Coca-Cola to continue to hold and operate CCBA,” Coca-Cola said in a statement.

13.57420838837227," Coke Zero Sugar, new flavors lift Coca-Cola results; shares rise (Reuters) - Strong demand for Coca-Cola Co’s zero-calorie drink Coke Zero Sugar, new orange-vanilla cola and flavored waters pushed the beverage maker’s quarterly sales and profit well above Wall Street estimates, sending its shares up as much as 3 percent on Tuesday. The world’s biggest beverage makers, Coca-Cola and PepsiCo Inc, are responding to shifting consumer tastes by tweaking ingredients and experimenting with new flavors that are focused more on health conscious consumers. These efforts have helped revive soda sales after a years-long slump. Chief Executive Officer James Quincey said Coke Zero Sugar sales witnessed a double-digit percentage rise, while its new orange-vanilla Coke soda was also a hit. Sales of carbonated drinks rose 1 percent, driven by strong performance of its Coke brand, while smaller, immediate consumption packages of its flavored water and sports drinks drove a 6 percent sales increase in the business. Quincey is trying to make Coca-Cola a “total beverage company” by adding coffees, teas, smoothies and flavored waters to a portfolio that has traditionally offered aerated drinks. It recently made a big bet on coffee with its $5.1 billion acquisition of Costa Coffee and is preparing to launch ready-to-drink Costa products in stores soon. “They’re making progress with innovations in general ... it is still early for a lot of these innovations, but we do like the increased focus that the company is bringing to its core brands and also its coffee products,” Edward Jones analyst John Boylan said. Coke’s organic sales, which exclude the impact of currency swings and acquisitions, rose 6 percent, driven by price hikes and bottlers stocking up more products due to Brexit uncertainty. Revenue rose 5 percent to $8.02 billion and the company earned 48 cents per share on an adjusted basis. Analysts had forecast earnings of 46 cents per share and revenue of $7.88 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. For the second quarter, the company projected a 6 percent boost to comparable revenue, mainly due to acquisitions and divestitures, but said it continues to see an impact from a stronger dollar. It maintained its organic sales growth forecast of about 4 percent for the full year. “We expect the company to over-deliver on the 4 percent organic growth guidance this year, driven by innovation, global market share gains, and pricing power,” Guggenheim Partners analyst Laurent Grandet wrote in a note."

7.732068144830179," Strong dollar dents Coca-Cola forecast, shares slide (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co shares were set for their worst day in more than 10 years after the company forecast slowing sales in 2019, hit by a stronger dollar in the face of rising global economic uncertainty and lower demand for its fizzy sodas in some markets. The stock was down 7 percent by late morning, also pressured by a broader retail rout sparked by data that showed a surprise drop in U.S. retails sales in December. A stronger dollar is an added headache for companies like Coca-Cola and PepsiCo Inc that are already wrestling with rising freight and commodity costs even as they spend heavily on non-carbonated drinks to attract health conscious consumers. Coca-Cola, which gets nearly two-thirds of its revenue from international markets, called out Middle East, Argentina and Turkey as being particularly weak and weighing on sales in the first half of 2019. “We want to be prudent in our outlook guidance, given the macro environment,” Chief Executive Officer James Quincey said on a post-earnings call. “Consumers are under more pressure as we head into the new year.” To counter rising costs, Coca-Cola has raised prices of its beverages. But that has come at the expense of demand - volumes fell 1 percent in North America in the fourth quarter, while Latin America was down 2 percent. Coca-Cola forecast full-year profit to be between $2.06 and $2.10 per share, far below the average estimate of $2.23. The company also said it expects core 2019 revenue growth of about 4 percent, down from 5 percent in 2018. “The company seems to be playing it very conservatively on currency and taxes, but still a disappointment versus expectations,” Bernstein analyst Ali Dibadj said. Excluding one-time items, Coca-Cola said it earned 43 cents per share, in line with expectations. Revenue fell 6 percent to $7.1 billion in the fourth quarter, hurt by the refranchising of its low-margin bottling operations. Analysts had estimated sales of $7.03 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Coca-Cola’s fourth quarter topline was decent, but there are concerns on the composition, with volumes being weak, Jefferies analyst Kevin Grundy said, adding that the quarter was “messy”. Shares of British soft drink bottler Coca Cola HBC AG fell 4 percent earlier in the day, after it warned of higher finance costs and weak consumer spending in several of its markets this year. Coca-Cola rival PepsiCo will report results on Friday."

0.4255732474240192," Coke's coffers crammed with kina as dollar crunch hits Papua New Guinea (Reuters) - Coca-Cola has mastered the business of getting its sweet, fizzy drinks into even the most isolated of Papua New Guinea’s far-flung tropical islands and mountain villages. But getting the proceeds out of the South Pacific nation is proving much more troublesome, undermining efforts by the host of this month’s APEC meeting to portray itself as an attractive destination for international investment. Australian-listed Coca-Cola Amatil CCL.AX, which distributes Coke in the region, recently disclosed it was holding more of PNG's kina PGK= currency than it wanted due to foreign exchange restraints, a complaint echoed by other big businesses. The restrictions, used to prop up the kina by fixing its value in a narrow band, have created a shortage of dollars and a weeks-long queue to buy them. That is stifling business investment and with it, the country’s economic prospects, business leaders say. “For most customers, it has provided an impediment to the growth of their business,” said Robin Fleming, Chief Executive of Bank South Pacific, PNG’s biggest commercial bank and largest foreign exchange dealer. “It’s really strained some of those relationships with their suppliers overseas,” he said on the phone from his office in the dusty seaside capital, Port Moresby. Port Moresby is the venue for this month’s Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit of world leaders and PNG is hoping to use the high-profile event to showcase the nation and its investment credentials. PNG Prime Minister Peter O’Neill said earlier this year that after APEC, “everyone will remember where Papua New Guinea is” and not confuse it with an African country. Papua New Guinea has one of the largest economies in the Pacific Islands region, backed by mining, timber, fishing and huge energy reserves. Riding booming commodity prices, the kina touched as high as $0.47 in 2013 but fell as low as $0.33 the following year when the oil price plunged. Demand for kina also dropped away sharply since the end of construction in 2014 of a giant LNG project led by Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N. The dollar shortfall was exacerbated by lower-than-expected tax receipts from the PNG LNG project and disruptions to copper and gold exports. Papua New Guinea’s central bank responded by fixing the currency to a 150 basis point band either side of about $0.41 in June 2014. That made dollars cheaper overnight, driving a spike in demand exceeding meager supplies held locally by exporters. Demand for foreign currency exceeded supply by about $500 million in August, according to Papua New Guinea’s central bank’s most recent policy update. That has left businesses - even those earmarked for priority access to foreign currency such as food, fuel, aviation and medicine - pleading with suppliers to accept late payments. “It does make it a challenge to get the currency you need to import materials,” such as sugar, aluminum tins and plastic bottles, Coca-Cola Amatil’s Sydney-based spokesman Patrick Low said. Meanwhile, CCA’s stockpile of cash in kina jumped by more than a third over the 12 months to June 30 to 687 million kina ($200 million), half-year accounts show. Other businesses find themselves similarly hamstrung. “We need to minimize our purchasing in Australia,” said Ariel Sarangya, who manages a computer shop in the highlands and has cut back buying stock due to a lack of foreign currency. “You need to wait up to three months, sometimes more than that, it’s up to the banks. We have to take whatever they give.” Heineken HEIN.AS subsidiary South Pacific Brewery Ltd has quit all non-essential capital expenditure since the crunch began and has struggled to remit dividends to its parent, managing director, Stan Joyce, told Reuters. The company even briefly considered buying coffee and trying to sell that offshore to bring in some U.S. dollars, he added. Economists say the solution is to let the kina gradually fall to encourage dollars to flow. But the government is staking its hopes on an anticipated $13 billion in foreign investment expected as part of an expansion of the PNG LNG project, and recovering commodity prices, to stabilize the currency. It has also cut dollar-denominated imports of fuel and last month raised $500 million with its debut sovereign bond issue. “Much work going into import replacement, bringing fishing and logging industries processing onshore, lowering transport, energy and communication costs,” Treasurer Charles Abel said in an email, adding the backlog should be cleared by year’s end. Businesses and economists are less sure, and say restraints need to be dropped before investment flows again. In the meantime, though, Coke is flowing just fine, with PNG revenue and earnings up for the half-year. “The most popular drink here in Papua New Guinea is Coke,” said Raymond Yafus, a storeman at a supermarket in PNG’s second-largest city, Lae."
1.1380909341985215," Coca-Cola proposes energy drinks in clash with Monster Beverage (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co KO.N is planning to launch a range of energy drinks for the first time on its own brand name as it intensifies efforts to break away from its traditional fizzy sodas and shift to health-focused trends. The company on Thursday told Reuters it was working on plans to launch new drinks which would be branded “Coca-Cola Energy” and “Coca-Cola Energy No Sugar” and made with naturally-derived caffeine and guarana extract. Coke has previously taken a cautious approach to energy drinks as they are wrought with controversy in both the United States and international markets after some drinks were linked to deaths in young people. The company initially took a nearly 17 percent stake in energy drinks maker Monster Beverage Corp MNST.O in 2015, making Coke the largest shareholder, to sample at a distance the market in which it had a small presence with its NOS and Full throttle brands. However, the partnership has turned rocky with Coke currently in arbitration with Monster Beverage over the launch of the Coke energy drinks, as it would put it in direct competition with Monster and violate their initial 2015 agreement. “We have submitted the difference in interpretation to an arbitration panel for resolution, which is the mechanism agreed by the Coca-Cola Co and Monster in the original agreements,” a Coca-Cola spokesperson said. Analysts, however, were skeptical whether consumers would take to Coke’s energy drinks under a brand mainly associated with fizzy sodas. “While Coca-Cola certainly has the distribution muscle to push new offerings, we question the fit of an energy drink under the Coca-Cola trademark,” Cowen & Co analyst Vivien Azer said. Stifel analyst Mark Astrachan said he did not think Coke’s new line of beverages would gain meaningful market share as consumers of energy drinks opt for something edgier. Astrachan said Coca-Cola may be using the launch to enhance the consumption of trademark Coke drinks rather than materially change its relationship with Monster that is currently worth about $6 billion. Monster shares fell 10 percent on Thursday after it revealed that it was in arbitration with Coke, while Coca-Cola shares were down marginally at $49.27."

Coke’s new products may violate an agreement between the companies that restricts Coca-Cola from making rival energy drinks, Monster Beverage Chief Executive Officer Rodney Sacks said. “We value our relationship with Monster. As in any commercial relationship, we will abide by our contractual obligations,” Coca-Cola said in an emailed statement. Coke also said “Coca-Cola Energy” would be planned to have caffeine from naturally-derived sources and guarana extract. “It would be developed as a preferred option for people who want these types of ingredients in an energy drink,” the company said. Any competition with the world’s biggest beverage company was a major risk for Monster, Wall Street analysts said after Monster revealed Coke’s plans during a conference call with analysts after reporting third-quarter results on Wednesday. “This reflects the outsize bargaining power Coca-Cola has over Monster,” Morningstar analyst Sofia Vora said in a report. “Monster’s ability to secure shelf space and distribution is contingent on its relationships within Coca-Cola’s vast bottling network.” Coke’s possible new energy drinks would raise uncertainty around Monster’s business, Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog said. Any competition could also mean that Coke — which has a history of building ownership stakes in smaller companies before eventually buying them out — was unlikely to acquire the rest of Monster, she added. Coke, which has a distribution agreement with Monster in markets including India, has been looking to diversify into health, sports drinks and even coffee, as customers continue to ditch its sugary sodas. Coke had indicated that it pushed the proposed launch of its energy drinks until April, Sacks said. Monster shares were last down 10 percent at $50.19 in trading before the opening bell on Thursday. The company declined to comment further on the impact on its business from any competition with Coca-Cola, but said its current ties with Coke, which owns some 19 percent of Monster, would not be materially affected."
1.2774599604200336," Coke profits get health kick in third quarter (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co’s quarterly revenue and profit topped Wall Street expectations on Tuesday, as investments to cater to changing consumer tastes paid off with higher sales of its sugar-free sodas and vitamin waters. The world’s biggest beverage maker, like rival PepsiCo Inc, has been building a portfolio of non-carbonated drinks and doubling down on its investments in enhanced waters such as electrolyte-filled smartwater. Coke also paid $5.1 billion for the world’s second-largest coffee chain Costa earlier this year and took a stake in Kobe Bryant-backed sports drink BodyArmor in a bid to court a younger demographic that prefers sipping lattes over gulping big sodas. Chief Executive Officer James Quincey played down media reports in recent weeks that the company is looking at cannabis-infused drinks in North America as a wave of legalization spreads across Canada and some U.S. states. “We don’t have any plans at this stage to get into this space,” he told a post earnings call with analysts, adding that the pace of acquisitions in the quarter should not be taken as a sign of how the company would proceed from here. “M&A of course is not a strategy in and of itself – it’s an enabler of our strategy.” Organic revenue, or sales from its core beverage business, rose 6 percent in the third quarter, led by double-digit volume growth for Diet Coke and Coca-Cola Zero Sugar. Volumes, a key indicator of demand, grew 2 percent in the quarter, roughly stable from a year ago. Carbonated drinks grew 2 percent in the quarter, while water and sports drinks, up just 1 percent in the previous quarter, grew 5 percent. “(We are) starting to see growth coming back into water as we’ve done a bit of de-prioritizing and moved more into premium and innovation,” Quincey said. Earlier this year the company launched new slim line Diet Coke cans along with flavors including ginger lime and feisty cherry. It promised earlier this month to introduce two new variants of its smartwater brand on the U.S. West coast. The strategy, which follows Quincey’s appointment last year, has drawn support from Wall Street analysts and investors. A 2 percent gain on Tuesday took its shares back into positive territory for this year and compared to a near 6-percent decline for Pepsi and an almost 5- percent drop in the S&P consumer staples index over the same period. Net income attributable to the company’s shareholders rose 30 percent on the year in the three months ended Sept. 28. Excluding one-time items, Coca-Cola said it earned 58 cents per share, beating analysts’ average estimate by 3 cents, according to Refinitiv data. Revenue fell 9 percent to $8.25 billion, due to the disposal of its low-margin bottling operations, but beat expectations. “We are impressed with Coca-Cola’s ability to deliver a strong and balanced top line, suggesting that its refranchising and portfolio transformation are paying off,” Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog said."

The world’s largest drinks company has been increasingly diversifying its portfolio to include healthier options such as sparkling waters as consumers move away from sugary sodas. Organic & Raw’s Mojo kombucha is a naturally fermented tea. Coke has been on a deal spree, ranging from a $5.1 billion acquisition of coffee chain Costa to a minority stake in a Kobe Bryant-backed sports drink brand BodyArmor last month. The company is also among the bidder for GlaxoSmithKline's GSK.L Indian Horlicks nutrition business, Reuters reported on Tuesday. The soda maker also said on Monday it was closely watching the fast-growing marijuana drinks market for a possible entry. The latest deal, the terms for which were not disclosed, will allow Coca-Cola to add Mojo brands to its portfolio of 165 products and 25 brands across Australia. “The addition of Mojo kombucha fits perfectly with the growing popularity of organic, probiotic drinks,” Vamsi Mohan, president of Coca-Cola Australia, said in a statement."
6.035479217859225," Coke eyes cannabis-infused drink market (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co KO.N is closely watching the fast-growing marijuana drinks market for a possible entry that would expand the world's largest soft drink maker's ambitions further away from sugary sodas. Coca-Cola announced its interest in a statement on Monday, responding to a report from BNN Bloomberg that said it was in talks with Canada's Aurora Cannabis Inc ACB.TO to develop drinks infused with cannabidiol (CBD), the non-psychoactive chemical found in marijuana. Coke would join a rush by major alcohol makers and a cigarette company to test the cannabis market and find partners ahead of the Oct. 17 launch of legal recreational marijuana in Canada. Coke and Aurora, in separate statements, each said they were interested in cannabidiol-infused beverages but would not comment on any specifics or talks. Aurora’s stock soared 17 percent, while Coke’s edged up slightly. The CBD drinks would likely aim to ease inflammation, pain and cramping, the BNN report said here. Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog called the news “an exciting potential development” as it would take Coke into another fast-growing healthier segment following last month’s $5.1 billion deal for Costa Coffee and expand cannabis-infused drinks in the area of functional wellness products. The CBD products likely would be different from those produced by alcohol makers, which would likely give drinkers a buzz from tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive chemical in marijuana. Beer makers Constellation Brands STZ.N, Molson Coors TAP.N and Heineken HEIN.AS are all playing in the market for cannabis products. For example, Heineken's craft beer Lagunitas recently launched Hi-Fi Hops, a beer-flavored sparkling water with THC and CBD. “The THC beverages probably sit better with the beer makers, and maybe CBD fits better with Coke, in terms of playing off the health trend,” said Liberum analyst Nico von Stackelberg. Cowen analyst Vivien Azer cited growing consumer interest in CBD and said its properties lend the ingredient well to a sports recovery drink. She said she would not be surprised to hear of a similar deal by PepsiCo for its Gatorade drink. Pepsi did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the cannabis market. Besides Aurora, she said cannabis companies Tilray TLRY.O and Aphria APH.TO were likely targets for partnerships with big consumer companies looking to get into the market. Canada is the first major economy to legalize recreational marijuana, and shares in cannabis producers have rallied in anticipation. New Cannabis Ventures' global cannabis stock index has risen about 87 percent over the past year. here Several U.S. states have legalized marijuana but it remains against federal law. Sales in U.S. legal markets should nearly triple to $16 billion by 2020 from $5.4 billion in 2015, according to market research firm Euromonitor International, and Constellation says cannabis globally could be worth $200 billion in 15 years. “Along with many others in the beverage industry, we are closely watching the growth of non-psychoactive CBD as an ingredient in functional wellness beverages around the world,” Coke said in its statement on Monday. Cannabidiol is one of hundreds of molecules found in marijuana plants, and contains less than 0.1 percent of THC. It does not cause intoxication. There are already CBD drinks available in some markets, made by brands such as Dirty Lemon, Sprig and Kickback. Moving into this area carries little reputational risk for Coke, said Liberum’s von Stackelberg. “If they came out with a THC-infused drink, that’s a different question,” he said. Aurora's shares rose 17 percent while U.S-listed shares of fellow Canadian producers Canopy Growth Corp CGC.N and Tilray Inc TLRY.O were up 2 percent and 9 percent, respectively."

14.94419715070799," Coca-Cola takes plunge into coffee with $5.1 billion Costa deal LONDON (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co KO.N has agreed to buy coffee chain Costa for $5.1 billion to extend its push into healthier drinks and take on the likes of Starbucks and Nestle in the booming global coffee market. The purchase from Britain's Whitbread WTB.L of Costa's almost 4,000 outlets thrusts the world's biggest soda company into one of the few bright spots in the sluggish packaged food and drinks sector. Paying about 1 billion pounds ($1.3 billion) more than some analysts had expected, Coke will use its distribution network to supercharge Costa's expansion as it chases coffee chain market leader Starbucks SBUX.O and its almost 29,000 stores across 77 markets. Beyond coffee shops, Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey, a Briton familiar with the UK brand, said Costa would provide an important growth platform ranging from beans to bottled drinks in an attractive category, growing by around 6 percent a year. Coke already sells some coffee, such as the Georgia brand in Japan, but lacks a global offering, Quincey said in a blog post here, highlighting Costa's retail footprint, roastery, supply chain and Costa Express vending system, which the company plans to expand. “Coffee is one of the strongest growing categories in the world, and Coca-Cola needs to expand into coffee and hot drinks,” he said. Operating a retail chain marks a new challenge for 132-year-old Atlanta-based Coca-Cola, which mostly sells soft drink concentrates to a network of franchised bottlers. It will face a fight, as rivals are also bulking up in a fragmented market, keen to attract young people prepared to pay out for barista-made drinks and developing tastes for ever more exotic coffees. Nestle NESN.S, the market leader in packaged coffee, for example, has sealed a $7 billion licensing deal for Starbucks' retail business, while Europe's billionaire Reimann clan has built the JAB empire spanning coffee brands such as Kenco, Douwe Egberts and soft-drink maker Dr Pepper Snapple. Bringing Costa shops to the key U.S. market would affect Starbucks, McDonald’s - a major Coke customer - and JAB, which owns a string of chains including Peet’s and Caribou. Meanwhile, if Coke were to roll out canned or bottled Costa coffee drinks through its U.S. bottling system, that could upset the dominance of a joint venture between Starbucks and PepsiCo PEP.O, trade publication Beverage Digest said. The purchase of the biggest coffee chain behind Starbucks adds to Coca-Cola’s drive to diversify away from fizzy drinks and expand its options for increasingly health-conscious consumers, after countries started introducing sugar taxes. Coke shares were down 0.4 percent in morning trade in New York as investors weighed the benefits of diversification against concerns about profitability. “We do think investors will have questions surrounding the retail component of the business and lower operating profit margin versus legacy Coca-Cola,” said JP Morgan analysts. Coke did not change its outlook for 2018 or beyond. The deal is expected to close in the first half of 2019. Whitbread shares closed 14.3 percent higher following news of the deal, which analysts said was priced at a punchy 16.4 times Costa’s latest annual earnings. “Coca-Cola are one of the few companies in the world that could justify the valuation,” said Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. “Its global reach should turbo-charge growth in the years to come, and hot drinks are one of the few areas of the wider beverages sector where the soft drinks giant doesn’t have a killer brand. Costa will get lots of care and attention.” Whitbread had been in the process of demerging Costa from its hotel group Premier Inn, and the sale marks the latest transformation in a business that was established in 1742 as a brewer and which has also owned sports clubs and restaurants. Whitbread bought Costa, founded in 1971 in London by Italian brothers Sergio and Bruno Costa, for 19 million pounds in 1995. It only had 39 shops then, but now its maroon shop front is one of the most ubiquitous sights on British high streets, with 2,422 outlets in the UK and a further 1,399 in international markets, operated as franchises, joint ventures and wholesale outlets. Whitbread Chief Executive Alison Brittain said the price tag represented “a substantial premium” to what would have been created through a demerger. “We were not interested in a sale other than to somebody who had a strategic rationale and therefore would be able to create significantly more value than Costa could create on its own.” Some of the proceeds will go toward reducing Whitbread’s pension deficit and financial debt to ease expansion of the Premier Inn hotel chain in the UK and Germany, but Brittain said a “significant majority” of the cash would go to shareholders. Brittain also denied Whitbread had been pressured to accelerate the sale by activist investor Elliott and other hedge funds. “I would imagine they would be as delighted and surprised as anybody else this morning,” she told reporters. Elliott congratulated the board on the deal and said it “looks forward to continuing to engage with them to maximize the value of the remaining businesses”. The global market for packaged coffee and drinks was worth about $83 billion in 2017, a fraction of the $513 billion market for soft drinks, according to Euromonitor International, but it is growing faster. What is more, sales at coffee shops like Starbucks and Costa are growing even faster, as people increasingly indulge their habit on the go, rather than at home. Costa recently expanded into China to try to offset an increasingly saturated market in Britain, where chains such as Starbucks and Caffe Nero vie with thousands of independents. A burgeoning cafe culture in China provides an encouraging backdrop, but Costa faces intensifying competition there as well. Starbucks, which has 3,400 stores in China, plans to almost double that by 2022, while partnering with Chinese tech giant Alibaba BABA.N to start delivery services. Local rival Luckin also plans to more than double its Chinese store count to 2,000 by the end of 2018.

8.860894830242843," Coca-Cola bets on Kobe sports drink in fight with Gatorade (In this August 14 story corrects paragraph 2 to show Powerade is not ceding market share to Gatorade) (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co KO.N is buying a minority stake in a sports drink brand backed by basketball star Kobe Bryant, it said on Tuesday, seeking to mount a stronger challenge to PepsiCo's PEP.O Gatorade. Coca-Cola’s investment in BodyArmor - which will make it the brand’s second largest shareholder - comes as its Powerade drink competes for market share with Gatorade. Coke has also been rattled by falling demand for its trademark fizzy drinks. While Coke says there is “much work to be done” at Powerade, PepsiCo said last month that Gatorade was seeing higher demand after launching zero-sugar versions. “Proud of our team at @DrinkBODYARMOR and our new partnership with the @CocaColaCo who believes in our mission of becoming the #1 Global Sports Drink. Thanks @Gatorade, we’ll take it from here,” Bryant said on Twitter. Gatorade and PepsiCo's other sports drinks account for nearly a third of a $20 billion U.S. market, according to Euromonitor International. Monster Beverage MNST.O and Red Bull follow close behind, with Coke trailing in fourth place with a 7 percent share. Coca-Cola also has a 16.7 percent stake in Monster. “(BodyArmor) is a positive for Coca-Cola, which is continuing to pursue its product portfolio diversification strategy,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Nik Modi. BodyArmor is also backed by Dr Pepper Snapple - now part of Keurig Dr Pepper KDP.N - which made a $20 million investment in 2015 and boosted its ownership to 15.5 percent in 2016. But Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog said Coca-Cola’s investment could end BodyArmor’s agreement with Dr Pepper. “We have learned that BodyArmor has notified Keurig Dr Pepper that they are terminating their existing distribution agreement,” she said. “Although the timing and mechanism by which distribution will transition over to Coca-Cola’s bottling system is still uncertain.” Neither Keurig Dr Pepper nor BodyArmor responded to Reuters’ requests for comment. Coke did not disclose the size of its investment or other financial details but said it could increase its ownership in BodyArmor, whose higher-priced energy drinks use natural flavors and sweeteners such as pure cane sugar and coconut water concentrate. “We would not be surprised if Coca-Cola eventually acquires the remainder of BodyArmor,” Wells Fargo’s Herzog said. Coca-Cola, however, has historically stayed away from full-blown acquisitions, settling instead for acquiring partial stakes in companies - a strategy that allows it to test-drive potentially risky bets. Bryant, who first invested in BodyArmor in 2013 two years after it was launched, is now its third biggest shareholder.

The investment in BodyArmor comes as Coke’s Powerade steadily cedes market share to its more popular PepsiCo-owned rival. Coke has also been rattled by falling demand for its fizzy colas. The company did not disclose the size of the investment or other financial details, but said it could increase its ownership stake in BodyArmor. Bryant is BodyArmor’s third biggest shareholder and also has endorsement deals with baseball player Mike Trout and another NBA star, James Harden.

1.7695923791613926," Coca-Cola results pop as consumers turn to Diet Coke, Zero Sugar (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co KO.N topped Wall Street estimates for quarterly sales and profit on Wednesday, as more consumers bought its healthier soda options such as Zero Sugar and new flavors of Diet Coke, sending its shares up 2.7 percent. Coke and its smaller rival PepsiCo Inc PEP.O have been focusing on healthier drinks to garner market share as health-conscious consumers shift away from sugary sodas. The company has launched new flavors of Diet Coke in slimmer packaging and in the quarter introduced no-sugar beverages in smaller markets such as New Zealand. “We’re winning in the marketplace so far this year and our strategy’s on track,” Chief Executive Officer James Quincey said on a call with analysts. Organic revenue, or sales from its core beverage business, rose 5 percent in the quarter, with Diet Coke, Coke Zero and sparkling water contributing the most. Volumes, a key indicator of demand, grew 2 percent on strong performance of its trademark Coca-Cola brand, and Fuze Tea. Global volume grew 3 percent, its strongest in five years. “We’re getting strong first half overall revenue growth and volume growth with our Zero, Diet portfolio in the U.S., which is a part of our strategy to go forward. So good numbers, much better than before,” Quincey said. Organic sales in Europe rose 7 percent after the company reformulated its recipe for a few sodas in response to U.K’s tax on sugar. “We were impressed with Coca-cola’s ability to deliver a strong and balanced topline,” Wells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog wrote in a note. Sales in North America - its biggest revenue generating region - rose 7 percent to $3.12 billion, but missed analysts’ average estimate of $3.14 billion, mainly due to weaker demand for juices and plant- based beverages. Net income attributable to the company’s shareholders rose 69 percent to $2.32 billion, in the second quarter ended June 29. Excluding one-time items, Coca-Cola said it earned 61 cents per share, beating analysts’ average estimate by a cent. Revenue fell 8 percent to $8.93 billion, hurt by the divestiture of its low-margin bottling operations. Analysts had estimated sales of $8.54 billion. Coca-Cola reaffirmed its 2018 profit outlook and said it expects full-year organic revenue to be at least 4 percent. The company’s shares were up at $46.49 in morning trading."

8.73028306256619," U.S. court revives Dr Pepper challenge to Coca-Cola 'zero' drinks (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Wednesday revived Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc's DPS.N challenge to Coca-Cola Co's KO.N effort to register trademarks for soft drinks and sports drinks whose names contain the word ""zero."" By a 3-0 vote, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington, D.C. threw out a May 2016 dismissal of much of Dr Pepper’s decade-old case, saying a trademark review board failed to properly analyze whether “zero” was too generic to be trademarked. Multiple companies sell beverages with the “zero” name, which often denotes an absence of calories or carbohydrates. The ability to market products effectively is important to beverage makers trying to counteract declines in U.S. sales of carbonated soft drinks since their mid-2000s peak. Coca-Cola and its lawyer did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Dr Pepper welcomed the decision. “We do not believe that any company should have the ability to claim exclusive trademark rights to a term like ‘zero’ in connection with zero-calorie beverages,” spokesman Chris Barnes said in a statement. Coca-Cola has used the “zero” name on such products as Cherry Coke Zero, Sprite Zero, Powerade Zero, and more recently Coca-Cola Zero Sugar. The Atlanta-based company’s effort to register U.S. rights to 17 drinks with the word “zero” prompted a 2007 challenge by Dr Pepper, whose products include Diet Rite Pure Zero. Coca-Cola argued that such names could confuse consumers. In 2016, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office’s Trademark Trial and Appeal Board said “zero” had “acquired distinctiveness” when used to sell Coca-Cola soft drinks. The board cited a 2008 survey offered by Coca-Cola in which 61 percent of consumers associated the word “zero” with one company, as opposed to 6 percent for the word “diet.” But the board also said Plano, Texas-based Dr Pepper could trademark Diet Rite Pure Zero because only full brand names, not the word “zero” by itself, were “inherently distinctive.” Dr Pepper’s appeal sought to force Coca-Cola to “disclaim” the word “zero,” broadly freeing rivals to use it. In Wednesday’s decision, Circuit Judge Kathleen O’Malley said the trademark board used the wrong legal approach to assess whether consumers thought “zero” generically described low-calorie or low-carbohydrate drinks. She also said Coca-Cola failed to counteract Dr Pepper’s evidence about how companies used the word, and that the passage of time made the 2008 survey’s usefulness “questionable.” The case was returned to the trademark board for further proceedings. The case is Royal Crown Co et al v Coca-Cola Co, U.S. Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, Nos. 2016-2375."

5.1479899635423445," Coca-Cola Co's Africa distributor to invest $100 mln in Kenya over next 5 years NAIROBI, May 30 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Beverages Africa (CCBA), the continent’s largest soft drinks bottler, said on Wednesday it would invest $100 million in Kenya over the next five years to improve infrastructure and launch new products. The company, which sells and distributes Coca-Cola Co products in Africa, plans to introduce 50 new products in Kenya to add to more than 130 existing ones in the country, local Managing Director Daryl Wilson said in an interview. “As the middle class is (growing)... they are wanting more variety,” he said, adding the new offerings would include various sugar-free and flavoured water beverages. “Kenyan tastes are growing, the need for new brands is growing,” he said. This month, the company launched a 7 billion Kenyan Shilling ($69 million) new juice line at its Nairobi plant. It operates four bottling plants in Kenya. CCBA’s distribution system includes 300 official distributors reaching across the country of 45 million people. The company operates in a dozen sub-Saharan African countries including Ethiopia and South Africa. Kenya is second in terms of profits to Ethiopia, Wilson said, where the company has plans to open at least four or five factories in the next five years. While Kenya’s economy offers a conducive business environment, bad rural roads take a toll on vehicles distributing products, Wilson said. Another challenge is electricity, where inconsistent availability of power in some of its plants has forced it to deploy generators, which are expensive. Wilson urged the government to “look at opportunities to reduce (the cost of) electricity, because it’s a big component of ours.”"
7.154898784290557," Coca-Cola Co to increase investments in Argentina BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co KO.N said on Tuesday it would increase its investments in Argentina over the next three years, giving embattled President Mauricio Macri's government a boost at a difficult time. Coca-Cola said in a statement it would invest $1.2 billion in Argentina from 2019 to 2021, up from $1 billion from 2016 to 2018, noting the “responsibility of the corporate sector in this transcendental moment for the country.” Coca-Cola was one of the first companies to pledge a major investment in Argentina after Macri took office in late 2015 promising business-friendly reforms after more than a decade of leftist populism. Macri’s government is struggling with the aftermath of capital flight earlier this month. The central bank hiked interest rates to 40 percent, the highest in the world, and the government is negotiating stand-by financing with the International Monetary Fund after a run on the peso currency. Macri’s popularity has plummeted and opponents in the Senate are trying to pass a bill to end the government’s planned utility price hikes. Macri has said Argentina cannot afford not to raise energy and transportation prices and needs to lower its deficit. He would likely veto the bill."

The company, one of Latin America’s largest Coca-Coca bottlers, said about a third of that money would be spent on its local operation, 30 percent in U.S. operations and 30 percent in South America. About 10 percent would be destined for its food business. Last year, the company invested 10 billion pesos. The company was due to report its first-quarter earnings on Friday."
6.02066364763345," Coke warns of pain from UK sugar tax, U.S. freight costs (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co KO.N said on Tuesday it would take a hit in the second quarter from the introduction of a British sugar tax on soft drinks and rising freight costs in the United States, overshadowing modestly better than forecast results for the first three months of 2018. The somber forecast undid an initial rise in shares of the world’s biggest drinks maker after it topped forecasts for revenue and profit, helped by a reboot of its Diet Coke brand that has introduced new flavors and cans. The company said it had reformulated recipes and launched smaller packaging to ensure that two-thirds of its major brands would not be subject to the new tax, but Coca-Cola Classic, its top-selling U.K. brand, will still face the levy, which kicked in on April 6. Company executives during a post-earnings call also cautioned that rising freight costs in North America, up 20 percent from a year earlier, would reduce revenue in the first half of the year. “People assumed that Coke sold to bottlers, and so some didn’t realize how much exposure the company has on freight,” said Brittany Weissman, a consumer analyst with Edward Jones. “But they do distribute and are affected.” U.S. packaged goods companies, already struggling with lower demand and price tensions with retailers, have recently begun flagging higher commodities and transportation costs. A jump in volumes due to the timing of Easter holiday shipments and price cuts in North America helped Coca-Cola top first-quarter revenue estimate by $300 million. Total volumes rose 3 percent in the first quarter, with growth in both sodas and teas and coffees driving much of the gains. Organic sales, which exclude gains from acquisitions or divestitures, rose 5 percent in the quarter. “While it’s good to see the underlying volumes improve, people are concerned on the pricing side, if those volumes are gaining at the expense of the price and mix,” said Weissman. First quarter net revenue fell 16 percent to $7.63 billion, due to the divestment of its bottling operations, but beat analysts’ estimates of $7.34 billion. Despite the strong results, Coca-Cola retained its full-year outlook for organic sales growth and earnings per share, which could also have disappointed investors, brokerage Macquarie said. Excluding items, net profit of 47 cents per share beat consensus forecasts by 1 cent, the company said."
