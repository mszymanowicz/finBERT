-4.360328325851827," Belgian plant says it complies with AstraZeneca contract amid vaccine supply cuts SENEFFE (Reuters) - A plant in Belgium said to be the main cause of big cuts in AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine supplies to the European Union said on Wednesday it had complied with all its obligations under a contract it has with the Anglo-Swedish firm. The apparent dispute could lead to further EU pressure on AstraZeneca to deliver more doses in the winter, as its COVID-19 vaccine began being rolled out in the 27-nation bloc this week. The factory, which U.S. firm Thermo Fisher Scientific acquired from Novasep in January, has been identified as the cause of the cuts by AstraZeneca in internal meetings, several EU officials have said. “We have complied with all the contractual requirements we have with AstraZeneca,” Thermo Fisher’s vice president for the EU, Cedric Volanti, told a news conference on Wednesday, when asked about possible production problems the plant had faced. AstraZeneca on Jan. 15 announced cuts in its supply of vaccines to the EU in the first quarter, which EU officials said amounted to a 60% reduction to 31 million doses through March. The company declined to comment on Wednesday on Thermo Fisher’s remarks. In a public statement it had said the drop in expected doses was caused by a lower than anticipated yield, or the amount of vaccine that can be made from base ingredients. EU officials repeatedly said AstraZeneca had told them that the problem had been caused by production issues at the factory in Belgium. AstraZeneca has never denied this but has also never publicly accused the Belgian plant. Volanti declined to comment on the number of doses the company has committed to producing for AstraZeneca and underscored that the change of ownership had had no negative impact on the production capacity of the factory. When asked whether the Belgian plant, located in Seneffe at an hour drive from Brussels, sold doses to Britain, Volanti said the company sends vaccines to an Italian facility that bottles them before delivering to clients. He added that the timing of deliveries depended on AstraZeneca. EU Industry Commissioner Thierry Breton, who leads an EU task force to expand COVID-19 vaccine production, said he was confident about the production capacity of the Thermo Fisher plant. After the supply cut announced in January, which followed an earlier downward revision of its initial 120 million-dose delivery target for the first quarter, AstraZeneca raised its commitment to the EU to 40 million doses through March from 31 million. The company has not said from where the additional doses would come. The EU has said that increase was a positive first step, but urged the company to further ramp up its immediate deliveries to the bloc, which has a contract for 300 million doses and options for another 100 million. In meetings with the EU, AstraZeneca said it could not send doses from factories in Britain because of contractual obligations to London. Breton declined to comment on whether AstraZeneca could further raise deliveries by the end of March but said output from a factory producing COVID-19 vaccines for AstraZeneca in the United States would go “almost entirely” to Europe. The Commission had so far said that doses for the EU were meant to come from four factories, one each in Belgium and Germany and two in Britain. Separately on Wednesday, AstraZeneca announced a partnership with German firm IDT Biologika to speed up output of finished COVID-19 vaccine in the second quarter."
-4.360328325851827," Qiagen is interested in organic growth and acquisitions - CEO (Reuters) - Genetic testing specialist Qiagen’s Chief Executive Thierry Bernard said the company is interested in organic growth and “bolt-on” acquisitions, when asked about recent merger and acquisition speculation during a results conference call on Wednesday. Late on Monday, Bloomberg News reported that U.S. diagnostics firm Quidel Corp is looking to make a takeover offer for Qiagen, a move that would follow Thermo Fisher’s bid from August 2020 that was rejected by shareholders as being underpriced. “We will continue, obviously, to consider any kind of potential bolt-on acquisitions that could support and strengthen our portfolio. But, as we said, not if it’s a game to dilute our activities,” Bernard said. He did not mention the reports on potential negotiations with U.S. diagnostics company Quidel. Following Bloomberg’s report, analysts have said the deal is “unlikely” or “would not make sense” as the companies sell competing products, limiting potential synergies, and the deal would increase Qiagen’s dependency on residual COVID-19 testing, which it is trying to avoid. Qiagen’s products include several types of COVID-19 tests that helped it recover after struggles in 2019, but it plans to keep growing sales even after the pandemic by making sure each new coronavirus-related product has other applications as well. According to Bernard, Qiagen should grow sales of its automated, digital PCR and tuberculosis testing solutions by 20-150% in 2021 as the pandemic helped it bring its products to new markets. “We have gained potentially one or two years of market growth as regards instrument placement,” Bernard said. According to analysts, these improvements are “important” and make Qiagen less likely to see a sharp post-COVID-19 share price correction compared to its competitors. Qiagen’s Germany-listed shares were up 1.7% by 1530 GMT. The company reported better-than-expected quarterly sales and profit growth late on Tuesday."
-8.723772194471927," Thermo Fisher sees 2021 profit above estimates on COVID-testing boost (Reuters) - Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc on Monday forecast 2021 profit above market estimates and posted better-than-expected quarterly earnings as it continues to gain from upbeat demand for its COVID-19 tests and materials for vaccine production. Thermo Fisher has been one of the major providers of COVID-19 tests to governments and healthcare providers during the pandemic and also manufactures some of the raw materials used to make vaccines against the novel coronavirus. Earlier this year, Thermo Fisher purchased Belgium-based Henogen SA, a unit of contract manufacturing services provider Novasep that manufactures viral vectors used in gene therapies and some vaccines. The Waltham, Massachusetts-based company also has a contract via Henogen to provide materials to AstraZeneca Plc, which slashed deliveries to the European Union by 60% in January, citing supply constraints. Thermo Fisher, which purchased Mesa Biotech last month to bolster its diagnostic testing business, struck a deal in September to provide contract manufacturing services to Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc, which is developing a vaccine for the health crisis. “There are many scenarios where I see testing demand being very robust for a long period of time,” Chief Executive Officer Marc Casper said during an investor call on Monday. “The truth is this pandemic is going to be around in some form around the world.” Thermo Fisher, the world’s largest maker of scientific instruments, estimated annual profit of $21.62 per share and revenue of $35.1 billion, above analysts’ estimates of $20.74 per share for profit and a revenue of $33.70 billion, according to Refinitv data. The company also forecast COVID-19 vaccine and therapy revenue to increase to $1 billion this year, while COVID-19 tests and products brought in sales of $3.2 billion during the fourth quarter. Shares of the company rose 2.7% to $521.2."

Henogen, a unit of contract manufacturing services provider Novasep, manufactures viral vectors that are frequently used in gene therapies to deliver genetic materials into defective cells. “Viral vector production is one of the fastest growing products in healthcare for the new generation of cell and gene therapies,” KeyBanc Capital Markets analyst Paul Knight said. Two years ago, Thermo Fisher bought another contract manufacturer that specialized in making viral vectors, Brammer Bio. Henogen has about 400 employees and is estimated to have generated revenue of 80 million euros ($97.04 million) in 2020, Thermo Fisher said, adding the business will be part of its pharma services business. Thermo Fisher has benefited in recent days due to demand for COVID-19 testing, with sales rising 36% to $8.52 billion in the third quarter, helped by a $2 billion boost from the testing. The Henogen deal was a solid example of how Thermo Fisher is likely to deploy cash flows associated with COVID diagnostics, Evercore ISI analyst Vijay Kumar said. “Acquiring a strong double-digit top business is extremely compelling in this market.”"

3.524704411911059," Oxford ups COVID-19 testing capacity with Thermo Fisher deal (Reuters) - The University of Oxford has partnered with U.S.-based Thermo Fisher Scientific to ramp up its capacity to deliver COVID-19 testing data and help collect and quantify immune responses in its vaccine trials, the university said on Tuesday. The collaboration will increase Oxford’s testing capacity to up to 50,000 tests per day with its new rapid testing lab and a device from Thermo Fisher that can detect antibodies developed in a person against the new coronavirus, it added. “The equipment further enhances Oxford’s capacity to quantify the response to vaccines accurately and on a large scale as part of our ongoing clinical trials of the Oxford coronavirus vaccine to assess vaccine performance,” the statement said. Oxford is working on an experimental COVID-19 vaccine with AstraZeneca, and eagerly anticipated data from large studies of the vaccine, one of the frontrunners, is expected by year-end. Pfizer on Monday said its vaccine was over 90% effective. Researchers at Oxford will expand the use of Thermo Fisher’s test in Britain’s COVID-19 infection survey by collecting and studying infection and antibody data for about a year, the chief investigator of the survey, Sarah Walker, said. The test is called Thermo Scientific OmnipathTM Combi SARS-CoV-2 IgG ELISA, and the American company has also collaborated with WuXi Diagnostics and the Mayo Clinic on another COVID-19 test here. The Oxford statement said the collaboration would also help Britain in its plans to tackle the coronavirus. The country went into another lockdown this month following a surge in infections."

The U.S. lab equipment supplier’s 11.3 billion euro bid was scuppered when only 44% of Qiagen shares were tendered by a Monday deadline, short of the two thirds it needed, following a hedge fund’s campaign to reject the offer. Qiagen vowed in a statement to “deliver growth and create greater value.” “The magnitude and duration of the global coronavirus pandemic have proven the increasingly critical importance of molecular testing to society. Qiagen’s business prospects have improved significantly,” said Chief Executive Thierry Bernard. Operating income jumped 84% to $186 million during the first half, as extraordinary demand for molecular technology to detect the new pathogen outweighed negative effects from lockdown measures. Qiagen added that it now plans to buy the 80.1% it does not already own of NeuMoDx Molecular Inc, a supplier of testing gear for COVID-19 and other infections, for about $234 million. Activist investor Davidson Kempner, owner of an 8% stake in Qiagen which campaigned against Thermo Fisher’s bid, said management should now improve its interactions with shareholders, focus on high-growth businesses and be disciplined about its investments. Evercore ISI analysts said they were doubtful a new industrial bidder was waiting in the wings as the longevity of COVID diagnostics demand was very hard to predict and earnings and market valuation may be peaking. Thermo Fisher in July sweetened its offer to 43 euros per share from 39 euros after pressure from some investors, but still did not win over Davidson Kempner. As part of the sweetened offer, Thermo Fisher also reduced the minimum acceptance threshold from 75% of outstanding ordinary share capital.

Thermo Fisher in mid-July raised its bid for Qiagen by 900 million euros ($1 billion) to 11.3 billion euros but failed to win over Davidson Kempner, a key investor in the German company.

The U.S. laboratory equipment supplier said it had lifted its bid to 43 euros per share from 39 euros, representing a 35% premium to Qiagen’s closing price when it made the initial offer on March 2. The revised offer values Qiagen at 11.3 billion euros and is backed by Qiagen’s board. Thermo Fisher has been under pressure from some Qiagen shareholders to sweeten its bid, particularly after the company said last week it was experiencing strong demand for products related to coronavirus testing. One of those investors, hedge fund Davidson Kempner, said on Thursday that it would reject the new offer because it still “falls short of fair value”. It said a price of between 48 euros and 52 euros a share was more appropriate. Thermo Fisher Chief Executive Marc N.

13.635562840720942," U.S. FDA approves Thermo Fisher's coronavirus test: official WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Friday approved Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc’s coronavirus test, which would allow the firm to increase capacity to 1.4 million tests a week, a Trump administration official said. “This will dramatically increase our ability to test people for the virus,” the official said. It was not immediately clear if capacity referred to test kit production or processing of tests performed on individual patients. The move comes as the Trump administration struggles to meet demand for testing. The FDA has already approved emergency authorization for a faster coronavirus test made by Swiss diagnostics maker Roche. Trump has blamed his administration’s lag in testing for the virus on rules and regulations inherited from the previous administration. In a news conference held in the White House Rose Garden earlier on Friday, he said the federal government was partnering with the private sector to ramp up test kit production to make them more widely available to Americans. He said there would be about 5 million coronavirus test kits available soon, but he doubted the full amount would be necessary and urged Americans to only seek testing if they were exhibiting certain symptoms. “We don’t want people to take a test if we feel that they shouldn’t be doing it and we don’t want everyone running out and taking - only if you have certain symptoms,” he said.

14.745911124323472," Thermo Fisher hires senior Goldman banker as strategy chief after Qiagen deal (Reuters) - Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc has hired former Goldman Sachs & Co investment banker Paul Parker as its strategy and corporate development head, according to a press release on Tuesday. Parker will report to Thermo Fisher's Chief Executive Officer Marc Casper, the release said. He previously served for six years as a co-chairman of Goldman Sachs's GS.N global M&A group and before that was the head of M&A at Barclays. Parker’s hire comes amid a push from Thermo Fisher to grow its reach in scientific research through strategic dealmaking. Last week, the scientific instrument giant bought Qiagen for $11.5 billion to bolster its diagnostics business. The company’s current strategy head, Shiraz Ladiwala, will retire next year and will spend his remaining time with the company integrating Qiagen, the release said. Goldman advised Qiagen in last week’s transaction. Wall Street rainmakers have long been lured to senior strategy roles by healthcare giants. Current Gilead GILD.O Chief Financial Officer Andrew Dickinson was formerly the co-head of healthcare investment banking at Lazard, and AbbVie's ABBV.N Chief Strategy Officer Henry Gosebruch was formerly co-head of M&A for North America at JP Morgan JPM.N. Parker will be based in Waltham, Massachusetts, where Thermo Fisher is headquartered. (This story corrects spelling of company to “Thermo Fisher” instead of “Thermos Fisher” in first sentence)"

11.953514546375567," Thermo Fisher agrees to buy genetic tester Qiagen in $11.5 billion deal FRANKFURT/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc TMO.N said on Tuesday it agreed to acquire German genetic testing company Qiagen NV QIA.DEQGEN.N in an $11.5 billion deal as the U.S.-based company looks to bolster its health diagnostic business. Qiagen, which has its main operations in Germany but is headquartered in the neighbouring Netherlands, is one of the world’s largest suppliers of products to prepare tissue and blood samples for advanced testing. These genetic tests play a major role in research and treatment of cancer, infectious diseases and genetic disorders. Last month it also began shipping a new rapid testing kit for the coronavirus to hospitals in China. The outbreak has claimed more than 3,000 lives and infected more than 90,000 people globally, after spreading from China to 77 other countries and territories At 39 euros per share, Thermo Fisher’s cash offer was accepted at a 23% premium to Qiagen’s closing price on Monday, Qiagen said, adding that the bid valued the company at 10.4 billion euros ($11.5 billion), including 1.26 billion euros in net debt. Qiagen shares rose 18% on the news to 37.5 euros, on track for their best daily gain in two decades.Thermo Fisher, which has a market valuation of around $120 billion, is the leading maker of instruments, software and other services for scientific research, including the vaccines and diagnostic tests now under development to combat coronavirus. Thermo Fisher fist approached Qiagen about a potential takeover last year, according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified because the details are confidential. In December, Qiagen ended the talks because it was not satisfied with the price offered and harbored concerns about the deal getting past antitrust regulators, one of the sources added. Marc Casper, Thermo Fisher’s chief executive officer, said that the instrumentation giant had long considered Qiagen a potential strategic partner. Qiagen’s coronavirus testing capabilities were not a significant part of the deal’s rationale, he added.”Deals happen when they happen,” Casper said in an interview. “When we got into the last few weeks, things really accelerated here. We were able to come to a price and deal terms that both companies felt are compelling.” Shares in Thermo Fisher rose 3.5% to $315.50 a share in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. The deal was the second to be announced this week in the healthcare sector, illustrating how some companies are braving the current market volatility to pursue deals. On Monday, Gilead Sciences Inc GILD.O said it would buy smaller biotechnology company Forty Seven Inc FTSV.O for its research in immuno-oncology in a $4.9 billion deal. The acquisition of Qiagen, which is expected to be completed in the first half of 2021, will immediately add to Thermo Fisher’s earnings after the deal closes, the companies said. Thermo Fisher said the deal would generate $200 million in savings by three years after the deal’s close. Jefferies analysts said they had long viewed Qiagen’s strong position in research labs, plus front-end prep for molecular diagnostics as attractive to larger life science conglomerates. For Qiagen, the deal comes after a tumultuous few months. The company's long-serving CEO Peer Schatz resigned in October when it announced a reversal of its strategy, saying it would stop developing its next-generation genome sequencing machines and instead collaborate with industry leader Illumina ILMN.O. JPMorgan JPM.N and Morgan Stanley MS.N served as financial advisers to Thermo Fisher, while Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz provided legal counsel. For Qiagen, Goldman Sachs GS.N is lead financial advisor and Barclays BARC.L is serving as financial adviser, while De Brauw Blackstone Westbroek NV, Linklaters LLP and Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky and Popeo P.C. are serving as legal counsel."

The company, which has a market capitalization of $8.6 billion as of Thursday’s close, said its management will start talks with interested parties as part of the review. Instruments maker Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc TMO.N approached Qiagen about a potential deal, Bloomberg reported on Wednesday. There is no guarantee these discussions will lead to a definitive deal, the company said. Qiagen’s Chief Executive Officer Peer Schatz stepped down in October after it posted preliminary Q3 sales below estimates due to significantly weaker-than-expected developments in China.

1.826682630784059," Thermo Fisher misses organic revenue growth estimates, shares fall (Reuters) - Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc TMO.N missed Wall Street estimates for quarterly organic revenue growth on Wednesday, hurt by an outage at one of its data centers, sending the company's shares down as much as 4.9%. The company, the world’s largest maker of scientific instruments, disclosed in a regulatory filing last month that overheated equipment at one of its data centers had released a fire suppressant gas, temporarily affecting some systems. This had caused a delay in orders, lowering the company’s organic revenue growth by 1% in the second quarter, Thermo Fisher said. The technical problem has been resolved and the affected systems are running now, Chief Executive Officer Marc Casper said on a conference call. The company said its organic revenue rose 5% in the quarter, lower than analysts’ estimates of a 5.5% rise, according to three analysts. The sales miss overshadowed an otherwise strong quarter, as the company reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit and raised its full-year forecast for earnings and sales, helped by a 9% rise in revenue at its life sciences solutions unit. “This is a fine print given the circumstances, but expect a healthy amount of debate,” Evercore ISI analyst Ross Muken wrote in a note. Thermo Fisher’s quarterly sales rose 4% to $6.32 billion, ahead of the average analyst estimate of $6.30 billion. The company said although acquisitions increased revenue by 1% in the quarter, currency fluctuations lowered the overall revenue by 2%. The company forecast full-year adjusted earning per share between $12.16 and $12.26, compared with its prior range of $12.08 to $12.22. Revenue at the company’s life sciences unit, which makes tools and compounds used in medical research, rose to $1.71 billion, from $1.57 billion a year earlier, beating analysts’ estimates of $1.65 billion, according to Refinitiv data. Excluding items, the company earned $3.04 per share in the quarter ended June 29, above analysts’ estimates of $3 per share. Thermo Fisher said its quarterly net income rose nearly 50% to $1.12 billion, or $2.77 per share. The company raised its full-year revenue forecast range to $25.30 billion to $25.50 billion, from $25.17 billion to $25.47 billion.

2.0908408704052412," Thermo Fisher scraps Roper deal after U.K. antitrust hurdle (Reuters) - Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc and Roper Technologies Inc said on Monday they have mutually agreed to terminate Thermo Fisher’s deal to buy Roper’s unit Gatan Inc owing to challenges in obtaining regulatory approval in the United Kingdom. The $925 million deal, announced last June, attracted the scrutiny of Britain’s competition watchdog, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which launched an in-depth inquiry in January into whether the deal could affect competition. Thermo Fisher, the world’s largest maker of scientific instruments, wanted to strengthen its electron microscopy business with the acquisition of Gatan, which produces highly specialized “peripherals” such as filters and cameras, used in microscopes. The CMA has raised concerns that the deal could enhance Thermo Fisher’s “already strong market position” and that prices of microscopes could go up and quality could suffer. It also noted the merger could hurt competition for certain peripherals. While the deal falling through is disappointing, it is not expected to materially change Thermo Fisher’s capital allocation framework or hit its 2019 earnings per share outlook, Evercore ISI analyst Ross Muken wrote in a research note. “Frankly, they could buy back stock and get a similar level of accretion, or more likely, will continue their focus on tuck-in M&A,” he said. The termination does not affect the existing long-term supply agreement under which Gatan supplies filter systems, cameras and software to Thermo Fisher’s electron microscopy business, the companies said in a statement. Shares of Thermo Fisher and Roper were trading up about 1% in early morning trading."

The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said Thermo Fisher Scientific had not offered any undertakings to ease the watchdog’s concerns. CMA previously said the deal to buy Gatan raised concerns that prices of microscopes could go up and quality could suffer.

16.5507503143553," UK competition watchdog puts Thermo Fisher-Roper deal under the microscope (Reuters) - Britain's competition watchdog said on Wednesday Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc's TMO.N $925 million acquisition of Roper Technologies Inc's ROP.N unit Gatan raised concerns that prices of microscopes could go up and quality could suffer. U.S.-based Thermo Fisher - the world’s largest maker of scientific instruments - said in June it would buy Gatan, a Pleasanton, California-based maker of instruments and software used to enhance the performance of electron microscopes. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said the deal could affect two rivals of Thermo Fisher who use Gatan products with their electron microscopes. “The CMA is concerned that the proposed deal could allow Thermo Fisher to weaken its competitors, enhancing its own already strong market position, and lead to higher prices for customers using electron microscopes,” the watchdog said in a statement. Thermo Fisher said in June that Gatan, which is part of Roper’s medical and scientific imaging unit, was expected to generate about $150 million in revenue in 2018. “Both parties continue to work cooperatively with the CMA through the review process. All other regulatory approval conditions have been satisfied,” Waltham, Massachusetts-based Thermo Fisher said on Wednesday. (For a graphic on 'Thermo Fisher buoyed by Gatan deal' click tmsnrt.rs/2A7MFP8) CMA was also concerned that the merger would leave Thermo Fisher with insufficient competition in the market for direct detection cameras. The watchdog said the merger would be referred for an in-depth Phase 2 investigation if the firms did not address its concerns. Thermo Fisher, which employs 70,000 people globally, is involved in life sciences research, diagnostics and laboratory products and services. The firm reported a better-than-expected third-quarter profit in October on higher demand for its laboratory products and raised its full-year forecast.
