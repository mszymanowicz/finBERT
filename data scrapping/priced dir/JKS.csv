6.382980375570431," U.S. solar stocks rise on Biden's clean energy focus in pre-election debate (Reuters) - U.S. solar stocks rose on Friday after U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said in the final pre-election debate on Thursday night that if elected he plans to transition to a more climate-friendly economy. Shares of Renesola Ltd SOL.N, Jinkosolar Holding Co Ltd JKS.N, Canadian Solar Inc CSIQ.O and SunPower Corp SPWR.O were up between 2% and 3% in premarket trading. Biden and President Donald Trump were asked at their matchup in Nashville, Tennessee, what they would do to combat climate change - the first time in a presidential debate they were not asked if they believed in it or not. Biden said the country should eventually replace oil with solar, wind and other forms of non-polluting power. “I would transition from the oil industry,” Biden said, adding his plan for a more climate-friendly economy would create high-paying jobs and boost U.S. businesses. Shares of oil companies were broadly unchanged as U.S. crude CLc1 ticked up 0.4% to $40.79 with demand concerns raised by surging coronavirus cases in the United States and Europe being offset by the prospect of an extension to OPEC-led supply curbs. After the debate, Biden told reporters, “We’re not getting rid of fossil fuels.” “We’re getting of the subsidies for fossil fuels. But we’re not getting rid of fossil fuels for a long time...they’re not going to lose their jobs. Besides, a lot more jobs are going to be created in other alternatives.” Trump, during the debate, cited a federal program to plant trees and a drop in carbon emissions to say he loves the environment, but added he was not willing to harm businesses. He accused Biden of planning to ban hydraulic fracturing, a process of extracting oil and natural gas from shale that is opposed by many environmentalists. Biden, however, said he would ban fracking on federal land only."

-4.812834224598923," China's Jinko to produce solar panels in Florida by fourth quarter despite tariffs NEW YORK (Reuters) - Chinese manufacturer JinkoSolar Holding Co Ltd expects to start manufacturing solar panels at a new factory in Jacksonville, Florida, by the fourth quarter, and production will not be affected by the latest round of U.S. tariffs on Chinese products, a company executive said on Tuesday. The administration of President Donald Trump on Monday threatened to slap a 10 percent tariff on $200 billion of Chinese goods in addition to import duties previously announced on $50 billion in goods, deepening a trade conflict that has hit financial markets and has led Beijing to vow a firm response. Jeff Juger, business development director of JinkoSolar, said the $50 billion in tariffs on Chinese products “do not impact our operation in Florida because all the cells we’re going to import (to the plant) come from Malaysia.” And to deal with tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on imported solar panels earlier this year, Juger said the Florida plant would take advantage of an exemption that allows U.S. manufacturers to import 2.5 gigawatts of tariff-free cells for use in manufacturing solar modules at American plants. “The 2.5 gigawatt exemption gives us quite a bit of headroom to import tariff-free cells,” he said on a panel at the Renewable Energy Finance Forum in New York. Speaking to Reuters on the sidelines of the conference, Juger said JinkoSolar has also applied for an exclusion to the cell import tariffs that would allow it to import a large-format solar cell it makes in Malaysia for use in building solar modules at its Florida factory. He said he is hopeful the administration will grant the exemption because JinkoSolar is the only manufacturer in the world that makes the cell in question. “If the government grants that exclusion request and lets us import these cells, it will allow us to further scale up the factory in Florida,” he said. The Jacksonville factory will employ more than 200 workers, he said, adding that coping with tariffs and trade issues has been part of JinkoSolar’s business for years. “We just have to persevere no matter what the circumstances,” Juger said. “The decision to invest in the Florida factory is a testament to our commitment to the U.S. market.” (This version of the story, in fifth paragraph corrects to 2.5 gigawatt instead of gigabyte; in paragraph 6 corrects “makes in Malaysia” instead of in China; in paragraph 7 corrects “the cell in question” instead of “the panel in question”)"
