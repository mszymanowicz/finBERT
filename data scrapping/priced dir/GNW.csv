Genworth said in October that regulators were scrutinizing the sale of its 57% stake in Genworth MI Canada Inc MIC.TO for about C$2.4 billion ($1.81 billion). The deal agreed to in August was aimed at completing the U.S. insurer’s long-delayed sale to China Oceanwide Holdings Group Co Ltd. The stake sale is expected to be completed on Dec. 12, the companies said on Monday."

Genworth said it would sell the stake in Genworth MI Canada Inc MIC.TO to investment manager Brookfield Business Partners LP BBU_u.TO for C$48.86 per share, a 4.1% discount to the Canadian unit's close on Monday. The U.S. insurer had already announced that it would explore a sale for Genworth MI Canada as Canadian regulators are yet to approve the deal with Oceanwide [OWREAC.UL]. Genworth’s shares were up about 18% at $4.55 before the bell. Oceanwide and Genworth, which signed the deal in October 2016, also entered into the 12th waiver and agreed to extend their merger deadline to not later than Dec. 31. The Oceanwide deal will still require clearance in China for currency conversion, the company said. Brookfield has also agreed to provide Genworth with up to $850 million in bridge financing if regulatory approvals for the deal are not received by Oct. 31."

19.422572178477683," U.S. security panel approves Oceanwide purchase of Genworth WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. panel that reviews foreign investments for potential national security threats has approved China Oceanwide Holdings Group's [OWREAC.UL] purchase of insurer Genworth Financial GNW.N, the two companies said on Saturday. The United States in recent years has blocked many proposed Chinese investments in American companies in an effort to stop China from acquiring important technologies, making this approval a rare win. The deal had been stalled over concerns by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) about Chinese access to sensitive U.S. personal data. CFIUS has become increasingly skeptical of high-tech deals involving China in particular and has blocked transactions that would have given it access to sophisticated semiconductors or data of American citizens. CFIUS has gone from virtually unknown several years ago to front-page news in March as one of its probes resulted in Trump forbidding chipmaker Broadcom Inc AVGO.O, which was in the process of moving back to the United States, from buying rival Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O. Oceanwide agreed in October 2016 to pay $2.7 billion in cash, or $5.43 per share, to acquire Genworth. Genworth currently trades at $3.81 per share. In order to gain CFIUS approval, Genworth said it will use a U.S.-based, third-party service provider to manage the data of its U.S. policyholders. Earlier this year CFIUS rejected Ant Financial's plan to acquire U.S. money transfer company MoneyGram International IncMGI.O because the companies could not mitigate concerns over the safety of data that can be used to identify U.S. citizens, according to sources familiar with the confidential discussions. Ant is owned by executives of Chinese internet conglomerate Alibaba Group Holding LtdBABA.N."
