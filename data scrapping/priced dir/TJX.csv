10.080824730621575," TJX beats estimates on HomeGoods strength, shares rise (Reuters) - Discount store operator TJX Cos Inc beat estimates for quarterly results on Wednesday, boosted by strong demand for home improvement products at its HomeGoods chain as well as activewear and beauty products during the COVID-19 pandemic. TJX’s shares, up about 37% this year, rose 4% in premarket trading. The chain, which also operates Marmaxx stores, has benefited from its diversified product offerings, as people largely staying at home invest in renovating and furnishing their homes even as they spend less on suits and dresses. U.S. same-store sales at its reopened HomeGoods stores rose 15% in the third quarter ended Oct. 31, cushioning the declines in its other units. TJX, known for its treasure-hunt shopping experience, now plans to roll out an online HomeGoods store next year, as many analysts have indicated that off-price chains are missing out on the e-commerce boom due to a near-absence of online operations. TJX’s overall third-quarter net sales fell about 3% to $10.12 billion, but they were above the Refinitiv IBES estimate of $9.36 billion. Net income rose about 5% to $866.7 million, or 71 cents per share. Analysts had expected a profit of 40 cents. The chain also said same-store sales at its reopened stores in the first two weeks of the holiday quarter were down 7%, with about 470 stores - most of them in Europe — temporarily closed due to government mandates. “TJX’s comparable sales trajectory is likely to be a bumpy road ... Q3 is confirmation that the TJX model is continuing to win share, has opportunity on gross margin, and should continue to outperform the market,” Bernstein analyst Jamie Merriman said. Same-store sales declined 5% at its reopened stores in the reported quarter. TJX also said it expects to reinstate a quarterly dividend of 26 cents per share in the fourth quarter, representing a 13% increase from the amount it paid in March."

-4.825039757830382," TJX says sales recovering after coronavirus slump (Reuters) - TJX Cos Inc TJX.N said it was seeing very strong sales at its stores reopened post-coronavirus lockdowns, offering hope of a swift recovery after a huge quarterly loss due to closures and a resulting decline in sales, sending its shares up 6% on Thursday. The discount chain is seen as among the better positioned retailers as its value-priced goods are attractive to shoppers looking to save money in the face of increased uncertainty about jobs and household finances. “Although it’s still early and the retail environment remains uncertain, we have been encouraged with the very strong sales we have seen with our initial reopenings,” Chief Executive Officer Ernie Herrman said. “We believe this very strong start speaks to our compelling value proposition and the appeal of our treasure-hunt shopping experience, as well as pent-up demand.” TJX, the parent of Marmaxx stores, said it has reopened more than 1,600 of its about 4,500 stores worldwide. MKM Partners analyst Roxanne Meyer said TJX’s sales update was a sharp contrast to what other mall-based retailers have said. “We think TJX traffic disproportionately benefits from its off-mall, high traffic locations as well as its cult-like customer following.” In contrast, department store chains, including J.C Penney JCP.N and Neiman Marcus, that have been through recessions and economic uncertainties in the past were forced to seek bankruptcy protection as losses mount and mall traffic declines. TJX in March halted both online and offline operations to prevent its employees from catching COVID-19. It said there will be no dividend for the first quarter and also does not expect to pay any in the current quarter. For the quarter ended May 2, net sales fell 52.5% to $4.41 billion. Net loss came in at $887.5 million, or 74 cents per share."

-13.58024337617577," Holiday demand powers T.J. Maxx owner's sales and profit beat, shares rise (Reuters) - TJX Cos Inc TJX.N beat Wall Street expectations for sales and profit on Wednesday, as more customers flocked to the off-price retailer's T.J. Maxx and Marshalls' stores during the holiday shopping period. Shares of the Framingham, Massachusetts-based company were up 7.5% after TJX announced plans to buyback up to about $2.25 billion of its stock this year and raised its quarterly dividend by 13%. New formats, better lighting, flooring and enhanced shelves at stores, and higher spending on marketing during the holidays paid off as the company recorded customer traffic growth across stores during and after the crucial shopping period. “Our gift-giving assortments at great values, supported by our marketing, attracted customers around the globe during the holiday season and beyond,” Chief Executive Officer Ernie Herrman said. Comparable-store sales rose 6% during the reported quarter, driven by strong sales at its Marmaxx and HomeGoods stores. Analysts on average had estimated growth of 3.03%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The company, which has been investing in its online business and launched Marshalls’ website in September, said it would keep its online product mix different from its brick-and-mortar stores as an incentive for customers to shop from both channels. “Q4 was another strong quarter for TJX, suggesting that the off-price format continues to gain share,” Bernstein analyst Jamie Merriman said. But the company forecast its full-year profit largely below Wall Street estimates as it planned to continue investing in new stores, store remodels and its supply chain. Rival Burlington Stores BURL.N, on the contrary, raised its fourth-quarter forecast earlier this month. Net sales for TJX jumped nearly 10% to $12.21 billion, while net income rose 17% to $984.8 million, or 81 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Feb. 1. Analysts on average had expected a profit of 77 cents per share on net sales of $11.83 billion. TJX’s shares were trading at a record high of $64.86."

15.617447350169172," TJX posts rare same-store sales miss as competition stiffens (Reuters) - TJX Cos Inc TJX.N forecast third-quarter profit below expectations and reported quarterly same-store sales that missed estimates for the first time in more than a year, as the discount store operator faces intense competition from online and other retailers. Shares of the company fell 4% to $49.41 in early trading. With traditional retailers such as Macy's Inc M.N and Nordstrom Inc JWN.N stepping into the territory of discount retailers, off-price stores like TJX and Burlington Stores are struggling to boost sales. TJX, which sells coveted apparel and luxury brands such as Dolce & Gabbana and Calvin Klein at a discount of 20%-60%, has been opening new stores, while also trying to attract consumers with treasure hunts at its stores, encouraging shoppers to spot deals among rapidly changing assortments. While the efforts helped the company report positive traffic, it posted its slowest same-store sales growth in six quarters, rising only 2% in the quarter ended August 3. Analysts on average had expected a increase of 2.95%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Neil Saunders, the managing director of GlobalData Retail, noted that above average levels of discounting across many apparel retailers was a serious threat to TJX this quarter. “This gave those shoppers looking for bargains more choice and more reason to shop around, something that had a tangible impact on both T.J. Maxx and Marshalls,” Saunders said. Same-store sales at Marmaxx, the biggest company unit that houses T.J. Maxx and Marshalls stores, rose just 2%, while that at HomeGoods, its second biggest, was flat in the quarter, both segments missing analysts’ expectations. TJX expects third-quarter profit in the range of 63 cents to 65 cents per share, below analysts’ expectation of 68 cents. The result follows a weak quarterly report from retailers Macy's and J.C. Penney Co Inc JCP.N with Macy's cutting its annual profit forecast and J.C. Penney reporting a slump in sales. TXJ’s net sales rose 4.8% to $9.78 billion in the second quarter. Net income rose to $759 million, or 62 cents per share, from $739.6 million, or 58 cents per share, a year earlier.

8.305745385317637," TJX's holiday profit forecast disappoints as freight, labor costs bite (Reuters) - TJX Cos Inc's TJX.N holiday-quarter earnings forecast fell largely below analysts' estimates on Tuesday, as the off-price retailer faces rising freight and labor costs, sending its shares down as much as 7 percent. Several retailers have warned that a shortage of truck drivers, new driver regulations and higher fuel prices would make moving freight much costlier this year. Wages are also rising in a tightening U.S. labor market. TJX said it expects the rising transportation and wage costs to cut next year’s profit by about 4 percent. “Unfortunately, the environment is not playing into our plans to have us picking up next year on our (earnings per share),” Chief Executive Officer Ernie Herrman said on a conference call with analysts. In addition to costs, TJX is facing tough competition from online firms and other retailers such as Macy's M.N and Nordstrom JWN.N, which have been focusing more on their off-price businesses. Unlike other brick-and-mortar retailers, which have closed stores and invested in e-commerce as shoppers move online, TJX has largely depended on deep in-store discounts to drive traffic. The retailer expects higher costs during the current quarter to hurt profits by 5 percent, resulting in earnings of 66 cents to 67 cents per share. Analysts on average were expecting 71 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The tepid forecasts overshadowed TJX’s better-than-expected third-quarter sales. The company reported a 7 percent rise in comparable-store sales in the quarter ended Nov. 3, above the 4.1 percent Wall Street had estimated. The company’s treasure-hunt format, which encourages shoppers to hunt for deals across a swath of products and brands in stores, helped drive its 17th consecutive quarter of traffic growth. Comparable-store sales in the company’s biggest unit, Marmaxx, rose 9 percent, marking the best growth in at least two years. Net income surged 18.8 percent to $762.3 million, or 61 cents per share, from a year earlier.

8.305745385317637," TJX tops same-store sales estimates Nov 20 (Reuters) - Off-price apparel retailer TJX Cos Inc reported better-than-expected quarterly same-store sales on Tuesday, as heavy discounting drove more shoppers to its T.J. Maxx and Marshalls stores. TJX said same-store sales rose 7 percent in the third quarter ended Nov. 3, better than analysts’ average estimate of a 4.1 percent increase, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Its net sales climbed to $9.83 billion from $8.76 billion. Third-quarter net income rose to $762.3 million or 61 cents per share, from $641.4 million or 50 cents per share a year earlier.

-12.96624376458883," TJX beats estimates as big discounts attract young shoppers (Reuters) - TJX Cos Inc TJX.N reported a 6 percent rise in quarterly comparable-store sales on Tuesday, topping analysts' estimates as big discounts attracted more younger shoppers and generated the off-price retailer's 16th consecutive quarter of customer-traffic growth. Unlike Macy's Inc M.N and J.C. Penney Co Inc JCP.N, which have closed stores and shifted their focus online, TJX has stuck to brick and mortar retail, thriving in a period of uncertainty for major U.S. retailers driven by the growth of Amazon.com and other web-based players. The company’s treasure-hunt style marketing technique, based on unpublicized but deep discounts on branded apparel and accessories, proved to be a hit with younger customers, driving a 34 percent jump in profit and lifting its shares by 5 percent to a record high. “We have been attracting a significant share of millennial and Gen-Z shoppers among our new customers at each of our divisions...which indeed bodes very well for our future,” TJX Chief Executive Officer Ernie Herrman said. The 6 percent rise in same-store sales in the second quarter, easily beat the 2.2 percent increase analysts had expected, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company also raised its full-year same store sales growth forecast to 3 to 4 percent, above the average estimate of a 2.4 percent increase. The company’s Marmaxx unit, which includes T.J. Maxx and Marshalls stores, saw a 7 percent increase in same-store sales as it attracted more new customers, the majority of whom were between the ages of 18 and 34. Herrman declined to say what products younger customers were buying. However, Jessica Ramirez, an analyst with Jane Hali & Associates, said TJX stocking more trendy active wear and beauty products in its stores was attracting more shoppers. The company’s net income rose to $739.6 million, or $1.17 per share, in the second quarter ended Aug. 4, from $553 million, or 85 cents per share, a year earlier. The retailer also raised its full-year adjusted profit forecast. The Framingham, Massachusetts-based company said net sales during the quarter rose 11.6 percent to $9.33 billion. Analysts expected the company to report earnings of $1.05 per share on revenue of $9.00 billion. “...the retail game is still being played firmly in TJX’s ballpark,” Neil Saunders, Managing Director of GlobalData Retail said in an email. “People simply enjoy the thrill of snagging a bargain.”"

5.0226953073612055," U.S. hedge funds bet on retail, tech in second-quarter as economy sizzled (Reuters) - Prominent hedge fund managers appeared to make big second-quarter bets that the U.S. economy would continue to expand despite increasing concerns about a broadening trade dispute between the United States and China, regulatory filings showed Tuesday. Third Point added new positions in payment companies PayPal Holdings Inc PYPL.O and Visa Inc V.N, both of which are up more than 19 percent year to date. Greenlight Capital, run by billionaire investor David Einhorn, added new positions in low-to-middle income retailers including Dollar Tree Inc DLTR.O, Dollar General Corp DG.N, Gap Inc GPS.N, and TJX Companies Inc TJX.N, the parent company of discount retailers TJ Maxx and HomeGoods. Activist fund Jana Partners added shares of broad-based exchange-traded funds that track the S&P 500 and the Russell 2000 indexes and took new positions in Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N and food delivery company GrubHub Inc GRUB.N. The flurry of new positions in cyclical companies came during a quarter in which U.S. gross domestic product increased at an annual rate of 4.1 percent, nearly double the 2.2 percent rate of the first quarter of the year, according to Commerce Department estimates. A rally in cyclical companies would help boost hedge fund industry returns at a time when many fund firms are under pressure from investors to lower their fees or improve their performance. Hedge funds, on average, are up 1.5 percent since the start of January, according to research firm Hedge Fund Research, well behind the 6.2 percent gain in the benchmark S&P 500 index over the same time. “Everyone is comparing everything to the S&P 500 and that’s a very difficult hurdle for the last few years,” said Sol Waksman, president of research firm BarclayHedge. Quarterly disclosures of hedge fund managers’ stock holdings, in what are known as 13F filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, are one of the few public ways of learning what the managers are selling and buying. But relying on the filings to develop an investment strategy comes with some risk because the disclosures come 45 days after the end of each quarter and may not reflect current positions. Still, the filings offer a glimpse into what hedge fund managers saw as opportunities to make money on the long side. The filings do not disclose short positions, or bets that a stock will fall in price. As a result, the public filings do not always present a complete picture of a management firm’s stock holdings. Large hedge fund managers cut their positions in some of the so-called FAANG stocks - the moniker given to Facebook Inc FB.O, Apple Inc AAPL.O, Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O, Netflix Inc NFLX.O, and Google-parent Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O - that led the market higher last year. Third Point sold all of its stake in Alphabet and divested 1 million shares of Facebook, reducing its position in the company by 25 percent. At the same time, it increased its stake in Microsoft Corp MSFT.O by nearly 310 percent, buying 1.7 million shares. Omega Advisors, meanwhile, sold all of its position in Netflix and added new holdings in biotechnology companies including Madrigal Pharmaceuticals Inc MDGL.O and Deciphera Pharmaceuticals Inc DCPH.O. A number of prominent fund managers sharply cut their stake in Apple only weeks before it became the first publicly traded U.S. company to be worth more than $1 trillion. Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital slashed its stake by 77 percent, while Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management got rid of 95 percent. Advisory firm Diamond Hill Capital Management cut its stake by 27 percent. Other big holders, including Sanders Capital and Adage Capital Partners, trimmed only small amounts in the second quarter."
21.406481383174913," Bargain-hungry shoppers help TJX beat sales forecasts (Reuters) - TJX Cos Inc TJX.N attracted more bargain hunters in the first quarter, helping the off-price apparel retailer report same-store sales above Wall Street expectations and sending its shares to a record high on Tuesday. The company’s focus on keeping prices low and making shopping more engaging has helped it draw more people to its T.J. Maxx and Marshalls stores, a stark contrast to many U.S. retailers that have been hit hard by consumers shopping online. TJX does not advertise the brands it sells, but encourages shoppers to go on a “treasure hunt” through its aisles to find ever-changing deals on a wide array of products. If lucky, a shopper can sometimes find a Versace coat at a T.J. Maxx at half the price offered by most other retailers. “The treasure hunt nature continues to drive new interest, new people and more visits by current customers,” said Brian Yarbrough, an analyst at Edward Jones. On the other hand, retailers including Macy’s, Kohl’s and Nordstrom are investing heavily in online shopping. TJX’s products, prices and inventory management dispel the notion that it needs a bigger online presence, Yarbrough said. “We are convinced that the ability to touch and feel the merchandise and the inspiration that our shopping experience elicits, leads to instant gratification — all important factors for shoppers,” Chief Executive Officer Ernie Herrman said on a conference call with analysts. TJX reported a 3 percent rise in same-store sales in the first quarter ended May 5, compared with the 2.5 percent increase analysts had estimated, marking the seventh time in nine quarters the company has topped expectations. Shares of the Framingham, Massachusetts-based retailer rose as much as 4.8 percent to an all-time high of $88.74 on Tuesday afternoon. TJX warned that rising freight costs will likely lower its earnings later in the year. Still, the company slightly lifted its forecast for yearly adjusted earnings to $4.04 to $4.10 per share from $4.00 to $4.08. TJX expects second-quarter net sales of about $9 billion. Analysts on average were expecting $8.89 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Its first-quarter net income soared 33.6 percent year-over-year to $716.4 million, or $1.13 per share. Net sales climbed 11.6 percent to $8.69 billion, topping expectations of $8.47 billion."
