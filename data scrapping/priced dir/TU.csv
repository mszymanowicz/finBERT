5.781674856962181," Telus pressed to remove Huawei gear from 4G network in Canada's capital: Globe and Mail (Reuters) - Canadian telecom operator Telus Corp T.TO is being pressed by authorities to remove Huawei gear from its 4G infrastructure in the national capital region, the Globe and Mail reported on Tuesday, citing sources. Telus had reached an understanding with the Department of Innovation, Science and Economic Development earlier to not use Huawei's equipment in the region, the report said. The commitment was voluntary and was never formalized, it added. (tgam.ca/2Y3NgOe) Telus and the Department of Innovation, Science and Economic Development did not immediately respond to Reuters’ requests for comment. Most of Canada’s federal government offices are in the national capital region. Earlier this month, Telus picked Nokia and Ericsson over Huawei as its 5G equipment supplier amid uncertainty over Huawei’s fate in the country. Canada, which is reviewing security implications of 5G networks, is yet to decide whether to allow Huawei to provide equipment for the country’s telcos."

Day, who is white, made the comments during a TV panel discussion about protests in the United States over the death of an unarmed black man, George Floyd, in Minneapolis police custody. “Should we all be more sensitive about hurting or insulting people whether it’s racist or not?” Day said on CBC News’ Power & Play on Tuesday. “Should I have gone through school and been mocked because I had glasses and been called four eyes because of the occupation of my parents? No, of course not.” Telus said the views expressed by Day were not reflective of its values, adding his resignation was effective immediately. Day also resigned as a strategic adviser to a large Canadian law firm which, in a statement, disputed his remarks that systemic racism did not exist in Canada. On Twitter, Day, a former Conservative public safety minister, apologized to the black community for his comments. About 3.5% of Canada’s population identify as black, according to the 2016 census. “I ask forgiveness for wrongly equating my experiences to theirs. I commit to them my unending efforts to fight racism in all its forms.” Day could not immediately be reached for comment. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said on Tuesday that Canadians were observing the events unfolding in the United States “with horror” and also spoke about the need to fight racism in Canada."

3.18299912454333," UPDATE 3-Canada's Telus beats profit estimates on wireless growth (Adds details on wireless subscribers, CEO quote, analyst comments, share movement) Nov 8 (Reuters) - Canadian telecoms company Telus Corp reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday, as more subscribers signed up for its wireless services, including high-speed internet, and its cable TV service. The company added 145,000 total net wireless subscribers in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, higher than the 124,000 customers it added a year earlier. Telus reported the strongest wireless customer growth in about eight years in the reported quarter, the company said in a statement. Revenue in the wireless network business rose 2.2 percent to C$1.5 billion. The company said the business benefited from more customers selecting plans with larger data plans, coupled with lower subscriber defections. Telus’ peers BCE Inc and Rogers Communications also reported better-than-expected quarterly profit on higher demand for their wireless services. Largely lower subscriber penetration levels compared to the United States and other developed markets, along with a jump in population growth fueled by Canada’s fairly open immigration policy, is driving demand for wireless services in the country, said Edward Jones analyst Dave Heger. Vancouver-based Telus also gained from multi-year investments in fibre-optic cables that will help provide faster internet to its customers. “By the end of next year we expect around 66 percent to 70 percent of our fibre-network to be completed,” Chief Executive Officer Darren Entwistle said on a post-earnings call with analysts. Canadian telecom operators are ramping up efforts to develop the next-generation 5G network and Telus earlier this year completed 5G trials in Edmonton, Alberta in partnership with China’s Huawei. “Telus is positioned to continue growing its wireless business and to take share in wireline data and cable-TV services,” Heger said. Telus said net income rose to C$447 million ($341.4 million) or 74 Canadian cents per share, in the quarter, from C$406 million, or 68 Canadian cents per share, a year earlier. Operating revenue rose to C$3.77 billion from C$3.40 billion.
