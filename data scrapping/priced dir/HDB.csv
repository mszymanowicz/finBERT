13.290688366473013," Banks lift Sensex, Nifty to record closing highs BENGALURU (Reuters) - Indian shares closed at record highs on Thursday on gains in financial stocks and heavyweight HDFC Bank, continuing a rally that has seen the country’s main indexes scale fresh peaks in 18 of 27 sessions. The blue-chip NSE Nifty 50 index closed 0.42% higher at 13,740.70, while the benchmark S&P BSE Sensex ended 0.48% higher at 46,890.34. At its session high, the Sensex was about seven points shy of crossing the 47,000 level for the first time. Both the indexes have posted six consecutive weekly gains, boosted by record inflows from foreign institutional investors, progress on COVID-19 vaccines globally and signs of a nascent economic recovery in the country. Indian equities have attracted over $20 billion worth of foreign money so far this year, according to Refinitiv Eikon data, which is the highest in eight years. The U.S. Treasury on Wednesday added India to a list of countries it says may be deliberately devaluing their currencies against the dollar. In Mumbai trading, the Nifty Bank Index firmed 0.48%. Private lender HDFC Bank and mortgage lender Housing Development Finance Corporation were the top boosts to the Nifty 50, rising 2.2% and 2.9%, respectively. Shares of sugar producers Balrampur Chini Mills, Dhampur Sugar Mills and Rana Sugars closed between 0.8% and 2.7% higher, a day after India approved a subsidy of 35 billion rupees ($476.04 million) to encourage sugar exports. Building constructor Puravankara closed 2.4% higher, after the company said World Bank Group member IFC and its Emerging Asia Fund will invest $76 million to develop up to four of its residential projects. Global markets scaled record highs on optimism over a U.S. stimulus package and the Federal Reserve’s promise to keep pouring cash into markets."
21.28473204887155," RBI curbs HDFC Bank's digital, credit card operations MUMBAI (Reuters) - The central bank has forbidden India’s largest private lender HDFC Bank from adding new credit card customers or launching digital businesses after its digital payment services were hit by a power failure last month. The Reserve Bank of India has asked the bank’s board to examine the lapses and fix accountability, the lender said in a stock exchange filing on Thursday. It said the central bank would consider lifting the curbs on “satisfactory compliance with the major critical observations” it had made. “We are working on war footing,” said Sashi Jagdishan, Managing Director & CEO of HDFC Bank in a statement to customers published on the bank’s website. “We will work with experts and the regulator to fortify the identified areas for improvement.” On Nov. 21, HDFC Bank’s digital payments business went down for more than 12 hours following a power outage in its primary data center. The lender faced similar outages in Nov. 2018 and Dec. 2019. Suresh Ganapathy, analyst at Macquarie Capital said in a note that the ban could be in place for around 3-6 months. “The bank would at least take a quarter to resolve some of these issues and then invite RBI for a review.” The bank’s shares closed down 2.1%, reversing a 1.8% gain made earlier in the session. “The bank believes that these measures will not materially impact its overall business,” the lender said. With nearly 15 million credit cards HDFC Bank has the country’s highest market share of about 26% and was set to roll out new digital offerings, which will be impacted by the RBI’s move."

The broader NSE Nifty 50 index ended up 0.2% at 11,247.55 and the S&P BSE Sensex climbed 0.3% to 38,067.93. Shares of HDFC Bank rose as much as 2.3% after the top private lender’s managing director Aditya Puri said the bank was “back to pre-COVID levels.” The management also added that the bank was seeing a significant recovery in all forms of retail loans and was confident about a significant pick-up in credit growth in the upcoming festival season. HDFC was the top boost to the Nifty 50 index and its gains lifted the Nifty bank index to end nearly flat from a 1.3% fall. The Nifty metals index fell 2.1%, while the energy sub-index dropped 1.1%, weighed down by a 9% slide in Bharat Petroleum Corp after Reuters reported that Rosneft and Saudi Aramco were unlikely to bid for the Indian refiner’s stake. The energy and metals indexes were also weighed down by Royal Dutch Shell’s announcement that it plans to cut up to 9,000 jobs, or over 10% of its workforce, as part of a major overhaul to shift the oil and gas giant to low-carbon energy. Meanwhile, Reliance Industries Ltd rose as much as nearly 1% early in the session, after the company said U.S. fund General Atlantic plans to invest 36.75 billion rupees ($498.31 million) for a 0.84% stake in its retail arm.

In broader Asia, shares climbed as investors counted on super-cheap liquidity and fiscal stimulus to sustain the global economic recovery. India, the world’s second-most populous country, is slowly limping out of months-long lockdowns triggered by the novel coronavirus. However, a “robust credit delivery mechanism” helped HDFC Bank, the country’s top private-sector lender, report strong growth numbers in the tough environment, according to Macquarie Research.

-20.260200183207704," UPDATE 1-India's HDFC Bank net profit misses estimates on higher provisions * Provides for mark-to-market losses of 3.91 bln rupees * Posts loan growth of 22 percent in the June qtr * Net interest income rose 15.4 percent from a year ago (Adds further details from press release) MUMBAI, July 21 (Reuters) - India’s HDFC Bank Ltd posted a 18.2 percent rise in first-quarter net profit but missed analysts’ estimates as the lender chose to include all mark-to-market losses in the first quarter, leading to higher provisions. Net profit rose to 46.01 billion rupees ($669.43 million) for the quarter ended June 30, from 38.94 billion rupees a year ago, India’s second-biggest lender by assets said in a statement. Analysts had on average expected a net profit of 47.66 billion rupees for the bank that has the highest market capitalisation in the sector at nearly $85 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. Gross bad loans as a percentage of total loans stood at 1.33 percent at end-June, versus 1.3 percent at end-March. With its strong retail presence and relatively smaller exposure to sectors such as infrastructure that have led to record levels of bad loans in India’s banking sector, HDFC Bank is a favourite among investors. Its loans at end-June grew 22 percent from a year earlier. Private sector banks have expanded loans at a faster pace and have snatched market share from dominant state-backed lenders that account for the bulk of bad loans in India. Provisions, or the amount set aside by the bank to cover a future liability, for the quarter rose to 16.29 billion rupees from 15.59 billion rupees, last year, with the lender not opting for a central bank dispensation of spreading bond losses over four quarters. This led to a mark-to-market loss of 3.91 billion rupees in the quarter, the bank said in a statement. Net interest income rose 15.4 percent from a year earlier, while net interest margin came in at 4.2 percent. HDFC Bank’s smaller rival Kotak Mahindra Bank Ltd missed profit estimates earlier this week as provisions surged.
