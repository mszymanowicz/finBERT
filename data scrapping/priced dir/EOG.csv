U.S. oil prices have slumped over 35% this year as the coronavirus brought travel and businesses to a standstill, but with the easing of the pandemic-induced curbs, demand has begun to pick up and crude prices have rebounded from historic lows. EOG’s total output fell 14% to 716,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), while average crude oil and condensate prices dropped 29% in the reported quarter. The company anticipates the imbalance in the global oil market to extend into 2021, and expects to maintain its crude oil production at about the same level as the current quarter. The Houston-based company reported a net loss of $42 million, or 7 cents per share, for the third-quarter ended Sept. 30, compared to a profit of $615 million, or $1.06 per share, a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, the company earned 43 cents per share."

Oil prices plunged to historic lows earlier this year as travel and business restrictions sapped demand, while oversupply forced producers to slash output. EOG, which also operates in Trinidad and Tobago as well as China, said average crude and condensate price fell nearly 66% to $20.40 per barrel in the second quarter. Total output fell 23.3% to 623,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), after the company shut in production of about 73,000 barrels of oil per day (bopd) during the quarter. However, EOG said it started to restore curtailed production in June as oil prices recovered from their April lows, and it expects nearly all shut-in wells to begin production before the third quarter ends. The Houston-based company said net loss was $909.4 million, or $1.57 per share, for the second quarter ended June 30, from a profit of $847.8 million, or $1.46 per share, last year.

-16.343596065131745," U.S. cuts royalties for hard-hit oil, gas drillers (Reuters) - The Trump administration has lowered royalties for several drilling companies producing oil and gas on federal lands, according to a government database, as the industry seeks help weathering low energy prices. The move shows drillers are taking the government up on its offer to consider royalty cuts on a case-by-case basis after rejecting industry calls for blanket relief covering all federal leases. The U.S. Bureau of Land Management approved royalty rate cuts on at least 76 drilling leases in the state of Utah in recent weeks, according to the database. The cuts in many cases lower rates companies must pay on the value of their production from the typical 12.5% to 5%. BLM also approved suspensions of more than 90 leases in Wyoming, Nevada and California due to the coronavirus outbreak, the database shows. Suspensions allow companies to stop producing for up to two months without losing their leases. The database does not yet have information for other states. A BLM official said the bureau was following existing regulations when assessing applications for relief. “Any relief granted is temporary, for up to 60 days,” the official said. One of the top beneficiaries of the royalty cuts is Wyoming-based Kirkwood Oil & Gas. Steve Degenfelder, the company’s land manager, said it had also sought relief in Wyoming, Nevada and North Dakota. Other companies named on leases that secured cuts include Texas drillers EOG Resources Inc and Lonesome Oil & Gas LLC. An EOG spokeswoman said it had not requested royalty cuts on its federal leases, but has stakes in leases operated by other companies that sought relief. Lonesome did not immediately return a request for comment. Global oil prices have plunged due to fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, which has triggered unprecedented government stay-at-home orders and obliterated demand for transport fuels."
1.839653016428679," EOG Resources to shut existing wells, deepens 2020 budget cuts (Reuters) - EOG Resources said on Thursday it was shutting existing wells and delaying the start up of about 150 net new ones until the second half of 2020, as it further cuts its spending to battle one of the worst oil price shocks in decades. Oil and gas producers have had to take several measures to shore up cash that included slashing expenses, dividend suspension or reduction, layoffs and scaling back on activity after a historic slump in crude prices due to a supply glut and the COVID-19 induced fall in fuel demand. EOG said the cut in net production volume related to the shut-in will be an average of 40,000 barrels of oil per day (bopd) for the full-year 2020. The month of May is estimated to see a cut of 125,000 bopd. The Houston-based company also further reduced its 2020 capital expenditures to between $3.3 billion and $3.7 billion, a reduction of $1 billion from the previous updated plan and a 46% fall from the original plan. North American oil and gas producers have cut their 2020 spending by nearly 34%, or about $41.6 billion, from their original estimates, according to data compiled by Reuters. EOG said it has cut its operated rig count from 36 rigs to eight rigs during the last six weeks, with an average of about six rigs expected for the remainder of 2020. The action to reduce activity to six rigs should solidify management’s strategy of focusing on returns first, balancing activity for free cash flow, and supporting the dividend as a priority rather than growth, RBC Capital Markets analyst Scott Hanold said in a note. EOG said it currently plans to bring about 485 net wells on to production for 2020 compared with the original forecast of 800 wells, focusing on the Delaware basin and South Texas Eagle Ford basin. “In order to generate higher rates of return, the company has elected to defer some of its production until oil prices recover,” the company said in a statement. EOG now targets full year 2020 oil production of about 390,000 bopd at the midpoint, a 15% fall from 2019 levels. Analysts had expected 2020 oil production of 456,086 bopd, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. EOG reported first-quarter adjusted profit of 55 cents per share, missing analysts’ average estimates of 66 cents per share. Shares of the company were down 4% in extending trading."

The Houston-based company’s total production rose 11% to 78.2 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) for the quarter ended Dec. 31. EOG Resources said it expects 2020 capital expenditure to range between $6.3 billion and $6.7 billion, and announced a 30% higher dividend of $0.375 per share. The dividend boost comes as investors have been pressuring oil and gas companies to rein in spending and boost shareholder returns instead of embarking on costly growth projects. EOG, which has acreage in several U.S. shale plays including the Permian basin, forecast crude oil production growth of 10% to 14% for the year. A surge in production from the Permian has paved the way for the United States to become the world’s top crude producer, surpassing Saudi Arabia and Russia. Due to lower prices, the company expects to allocate slightly less capital towards increasing oil production, compared to 2019.

The company increased its forecast for oil volume growth to 15% from 14% over 2018 and tightened its spending forecast for the year as it benefited from efficiency gains and lower service costs. EOG plans to run an average of 36 rigs for the year, compared with 40 in February. Investors have been pressuring oil and gas companies to rein in spending and boost shareholder returns instead of embarking on costly growth projects, especially with oil prices hovering in the mid-$50s-a-barrel range. EOG, which reported $337 million in free cash flow for the quarter, said it could increase production, boost its dividend and generate free cash flow at $55-a-barrel oil. U.S. oil futures were trading at about $57.50 on Thursday. Shares of EOG were up 4.5% in morning trade at $74.63 after rising nearly 6% earlier. The company tightened its 2019 spending forecast to between $6.2 billion and $6.4 billion versus $6.1 billion to $6.5 billion previously, even as it said it was adding two more plays in the Delaware basin. “For the 3rd quarter in a row, EOG exceeded oil production expectations and CAPEX was below expectations. We sensed some investor apprehension ahead of earnings, so this solid print should quell any fears that were out there,” analysts for Capital One Securities wrote in a note on Thursday. Lower capital spending comes as oilfield services pricing has fallen and “not have much room to go lower,” executives told investors on a conference call. They also emphasized that EOG would not pursue any large corporate mergers or acquisitions. EOG disclosed that about 49% of its “premium” acreage is located on federal lands, potentially exposing it to drilling cutbacks. Democratic presidential candidates Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have indicated they would ban fracking or end new drilling leases on federal lands if elected in 2020. EOG’s executives said they have between two and four years of drilling permits in hand, and could modify their operations if stringent regulatory measures were enacted."

-2.562017761783766," Cheniere signs gas deals linked to spot LNG with U.S. shale producer * Second time Cheniere signs to buy gas linked to LNG spot price * Shows upstream U.S. gas producers taking on LNG price risk * May make U.S. LNG more competitive in Asian market -analyst SINGAPORE, Sept 17 (Reuters) - U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) producer Cheniere Energy has signed long-term gas supply deals with shale producer EOG Resources, with some of the gas tied to Asian spot LNG prices in the second instance of such a link. Cheniere typically buys natural gas using a price mechanism linked to a U.S. gas benchmark, but in a June deal with Apache Corp, it signed its first supply agreement tied to spot LNG prices. The EOG deals show an increasing willingness from upstream U.S. gas producers to take on LNG price risk. “With U.S. producers flaring export-sized quantities of gas in the Permian alone, there is a push to find any market outlet, even if it entails taking on some spot LNG price risk,” said Saul Kavonic, an analyst with Credit Suisse. Cheniere said on Monday its subsidiaries Corpus Christi Liquefaction and Cheniere Corpus Christi Liquefaction Stage III have signed long-term gas supply agreements with EOG to buy gas for 15 years starting from early 2020. The total quantity will start at 140,000 million British thermal units (mmBtu) per day, or about 0.85 million tonnes a year, and increase to 440,000 mmBtu per day, the company said. The LNG produced from the initial 140,000 mmBtu per day of gas supply will be owned and marketed by Cheniere, with its gas purchase price linked to Platts’ Japan Korea Marker (JKM), Cheniere said. Platts’ JKM index is fast becoming Asia’s spot LNG benchmark price. The move towards an LNG price link will give Cheniere more flexibility in selling LNG on a price structure that would likely be more attractive to Asian buyers. “If U.S. producers are willing to take on the long-term LNG price basis risk, we could see U.S. LNG more able to compete in the Asian LNG market under traditional spot and oil-linked price structures,” Kavonic said. Cheniere has not said on what basis it would be marketing the LNG produced from the JKM-linked gas. For the second part of the gas deal, Cheniere will buy gas from EOG at prices indexed to the Henry Hub benchmark. “Adding gas sales agreements linked to LNG prices supports EOG’s portfolio approach to marketing our growing production of low-cost natural gas,” said Lance Terveen, senior vice president of Marketing at EOG in a statement. Cheniere typically buys U.S. gas to use as feedstock for its two LNG plants in Texas and Louisiana and sells LNG to long-term buyers on a Henry Hub gas price basis plus a liquefaction fee. This formula protects Cheniere from fluctuating U.S. gas prices and covers its cost to transform gas into LNG through the liquefaction fee. (Reporting by Jessica Jaganathan; Editing by Tom Hogue)"
-3.3253620362415313," Low-cost fracking offers boon to oil producers, headaches for suppliers SMILEY, Texas (Reuters) - At a dusty drilling site east of San Antonio, shale producer EOG Resources Inc recently completed its latest well using a new technology developed by a small services firm that promises to slash the cost of each by $200,000. The technology, called electric fracking and powered by natural gas from EOG’s own wells instead of costly diesel fuel, shows how shale producers keep finding new ways to cut costs in the face of pressures to improve their returns. E-frac, as the new technology is called, is being adopted by EOG, Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Exxon Mobil Corp and others because of its potential to lower costs, reduce air pollution and operate much quieter than conventional diesel-powered frac fleets. Investment bank Tudor, Pickering Holt & Co analyst George O’Leary estimates e-fracs could lop off up to $350,000 from the cost of shale wells that run $6 million to $8 million apiece. While a handful of oil producers are capturing savings from lower well costs, the picture is less rosy for oilfield service providers. These systems can cost them up to twice that of conventional fleets to build. A rapid uptake could worsen the economics for a sector cutting staff and idling equipment as oil producers pare spending. That leaves this potential breakthrough technology in the hands of small service providers without the means to fully exploit it. ONE-SIDED SAVINGS Jeff Miller, chief executive of Halliburton Co, the top U.S. provider of fracking services, said his firm has tested the technology but has no desire to promote it. “Halliburton will be really slow around frac,” Miller said, referring to the costs of updating diesel systems to electric. Converting the industry’s 500 frac fleets would cost $30 billion, he estimated, too steep a price for oilfield firms, he said. He recently advised an oil producer interested in the technology that the benefits of deploying e-fracs “work for you, they don’t work for us,” he said at Barclays energy conference this month. Halliburton, Schlumberger NV and others have idled scores of diesel-powered fleets this year as producers cut spending due to flat to lower oil and gas prices. Consultancy Primary Vision estimates the number of active fleets in the U.S. fell 19% since April to around 390. Halliburton cut 8% of its North American workforce and reported second-quarter profit fell 85% over the year-ago period in part because of equipment writedowns and severance costs due to weak demand for its frac service. “Every week that goes by I get more and more negative about e-frac due to the harsh imbalance between the benefits achieved by the oil company and the costs incurred by the service company,” said Richard Spears, a consultant to top oilfield services suppliers. Schlumberger paid $430 million in late 2017 to acquire a diesel-powered frac fleet from rival Weatherford International, hoping to expand shale services. A spokesperson declined to comment on e-frac. This month newly-named CEO Olivier Le Peuch disclosed plans to write down investments that were “based on a much higher activity outlook with the ambition of achieving economies of scale.” “HARD TO JUSTIFY” E-frac supplier Evolution Well Services, which supplied the equipment and crew for EOG’s Eagle Ford shale operation, is one of a handful of smaller oilfield firms pioneering the systems. Evolution operates six e-frac fleets - mobile collections of high-pressure pumps powered by gas turbine generators - and plans to roll out a seventh next year. U.S. Well Services, another e-frac provider, has agreements with Apache Corp and Shell. Conventional pressure pumper ProPetro Holding Corp also announced plans to bring a handful of e-frac fleets to the market. “We’d kind of would like to” build more systems without firm customer contracts, said Ben Bodishbaugh, CEO of Evolution, the only purely e-frac provider in North America. “But in this market it’s hard to justify,” he said. The reason: e-frac fleets can cost up to $60 million apiece because they rely on pricey gas turbines similar to those that run utilities to generate electricity, compared with as little as $30 million for a diesel-motor powered fleet. Evolution would not say how much its fleets cost, but noted it is below $60 million. “It’s a bad time for service companies to be ramping up very capital intensive service offerings,” said Josh Young, chief investment officer with energy investor Bison Interests. “People always feel pressure to invest in the next new things, but sometimes you shouldn’t be investing in any of the things.” Companies like Evolution and U.S. Well Services that already have e-frac fleets would be winners if the technology takes off, analysts from investment banker Tudor Pickering Holt & Co predict. E-frac accounts for about 3% of active fleets, and could reach between 25% and 33% in the next five years, Tudor estimated. EOG began testing Evolution’s gear in late 2016, and signed a multi-year agreement about six months later. The shale company, well known for its use of cutting edge technology, runs four of Evolution’s fleets and plans to add a fifth next year. The agreement with Evolution “is an example of how we continue to find innovative solutions to both reduce our environmental footprint and improve the profitability of our business,” said Billy Helms, EOG’s chief operating officer. EOG is among the handful of top shale producers that generate more cash than they consume in drilling and shareholder dividends. At its Smiley, Texas, oil and gas well site, EOG’s crew carried on casual conversations despite the whir of e-frac pumps. No one wears ear protection, which is common at conventional diesel fleets, and the towering white silos holding frac sand were gleaming during a visit in August. At a conventional frac site just up the road, the towers were black from diesel exhaust. Evolution’s Bodishbaugh said some oil and gas firms see less polluting e-frac as improving their standing with investors who rate environmental, social and governance (ESG) attributes in their investments. “I’d say this year we’ve probably had more inbounds calls on the emissions profile than the economic savings,” he said. Paul Mecray III, a managing director for investment firm Tower Bridge Advisors who follows major service companies, said e-frac will only catch on if overall demand for oilfield services recovers. “While it may be a good thing longer term, I think it will take a lot longer to catch on than people think,” he said."

U.S. Well Services, another e-frac provider, has agreements with Apache Corp and Shell. Conventional pressure pumper ProPetro Holding Corp also announced plans to bring a handful of e-frac fleets to the market. “We’d kind of would like to” build more systems without firm customer contracts, said Ben Bodishbaugh, CEO of Evolution, the only purely e-frac provider in North America. “But in this market it’s hard to justify,” he said. The reason: e-frac fleets can cost up to $60 million apiece because they rely on pricey gas turbines similar to those that run utilities to generate electricity, compared with as little as $30 million for a diesel-motor powered fleet. Evolution would not say how much its fleets cost, but noted it is below $60 million. “It’s a bad time for service companies to be ramping up very capital intensive service offerings,” said Josh Young, chief investment officer with energy investor Bison Interests. “People always feel pressure to invest in the next new things, but sometimes you shouldn’t be investing in any of the things.” Companies like Evolution and U.S. Well Services that already have e-frac fleets would be winners if the technology takes off, analysts from investment banker Tudor Pickering Holt & Co predict. E-frac accounts for about 3% of active fleets, and could reach between 25% and 33% in the next five years, Tudor estimated. EOG began testing Evolution’s gear in late 2016, and signed a multi-year agreement about six months later. The shale company, well known for its use of cutting edge technology, runs four of Evolution’s fleets and plans to add a fifth next year. The agreement with Evolution “is an example of how we continue to find innovative solutions to both reduce our environmental footprint and improve the profitability of our business,” said Billy Helms, EOG’s chief operating officer. EOG is among the handful of top shale producers that generate more cash than they consume in drilling and shareholder dividends. At its Smiley, Texas, oil and gas well site, EOG’s crew carried on casual conversations despite the whir of e-frac pumps. No one wears ear protection, which is common at conventional diesel fleets, and the towering white silos holding frac sand were gleaming during a visit in August. At a conventional frac site just up the road, the towers were black from diesel exhaust. Evolution’s Bodishbaugh said some oil and gas firms see less polluting e-frac as improving their standing with investors who rate environmental, social and governance (ESG) attributes in their investments. “I’d say this year we’ve probably had more inbounds calls on the emissions profile than the economic savings,” he said. Paul Mecray III, a managing director for investment firm Tower Bridge Advisors who follows major service companies, said e-frac will only catch on if overall demand for oilfield services recovers. “While it may be a good thing longer term, I think it will take a lot longer to catch on than people think,” he said.

-11.869814477939732," EOG Resources profit misses on weaker commodities prices (Reuters) - EOG Resources Inc EOG.N posted a smaller-than-expected rise in second-quarter profit on Thursday, as an increase in production failed to offset a steep drop in prices for crude, gas and natural gas liquids and higher expenses. A shale boom has made the United States the world’s largest oil producer, overtaking Russia and Saudi Arabia, but an oversupply and a lack of new oil and gas pipelines in the region have pushed down prices. EOG, which also operates in Trinidad and China, said average natural gas liquids prices tumbled 44%, while gas prices fell 19%. Average prices for crude oil and condensate prices also dipped 10%. This countered gains from a 16% jump in total production to 812,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), which was also above analysts’ estimate of 804,746 boepd. Crude oil volumes grew 18%, exceeding the target range, while natural gas liquids production rose 16% and natural gas volumes increased 10%. Expenses rose 9%, primarily due to marketing, depreciation, amortization and administrative expenses. Cash operating costs declined 7% in the second quarter on a per-unit basis, helped by lower transportation, lease and well costs. The Houston-based company said net income attributable to shareholders rose to $847.8 million, or $1.46 per share, in the June quarter, from $696.7 million, or $1.20 per share, a year earlier. The income included gains from derivate contracts and asset sales. Excluding items, EOG earned $1.31 per share, 1 cent below analysts’ average estimate, according IBES data from Refinitiv. Revenue rose 10.8% to $4.7 billion, beating estimates of $4.43 billion."

The Houston-based company said net income attributable to shareholders rose to $847.8 million, or $1.46 per share, in the quarter ended June 30, from $696.7 million, or $1.20 per share, a year earlier. The income included a $138.4 million gain from derivate contracts, compared with a year-ago loss of $145 million from them. Total production rose 16% to 812,800 barrels of oil equivalent per day."
-0.9143117017870251," EOG Resources sees fourth quarter profit boost from oil and gas hedging HOUSTON (Reuters) - EOG Resources on Monday said it anticipates a $132.1 million non-cash gain from oil and gas hedging contracts in the fourth quarter, according to a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The gain represents a reversal from the prior quarter, when the shale producer booked a non-cash loss of roughly $52 million on its derivative contracts. That hit came as U.S. oil prices averaged $69.50 a barrel during the third quarter, about $10 above where EOG had hedged a portion of its production. EOG will report its fourth-quarter results at the end of February. Wall Street analysts anticipate EOG to report an adjusted per share profit of $1.40 for the fourth quarter of 2018, down from $1.75 in the third quarter, according to data from Refinitiv. Last year, the company reported a fourth-quarter profit of 69 cents."
-3.2036270238016895," Shares of EOG Resources fall 4 percent after it raises 2018 spending HOUSTON (Reuters) - Shares of EOG Resources Inc EOG.N fell on Friday, a day after the shale oil producer bumped up its 2018 budget to spend more to retain service providers through the end of the year. Wall Street analysts called the 2018 budget increase negative and investors have been pushing oil companies to curtail spending and boost shareholder returns. “EOG cash flow pleased us, but we do wish they would surprise with more cash return to shareholders,” Mizuho analysts wrote in a note on Friday morning. The company increased the midpoint of its 2018 budget forecast by $300 million to between $5.8 billion and $6 billion. EOG said on Thursday that retaining “high performing service providers” through the end of the year would enable it to have better service continuity into 2019. EOG shares dropped more than 4 percent to $102.46. The decline came even as the company topped estimates for third-quarter profit and revenues. EOG also beat its own production forecast for the quarter."
-7.3149317889045955," EOG Resources tops profit estimates, raises spending outlook HOUSTON (Reuters) - EOG Resources EOG.N on Thursday topped Wall Street's third-quarter profit and revenue estimates on record oil production, and raised its spending outlook for the full year. Spurred by higher crude prices and advances in hydraulic fracturing, U.S. producers have hit records nearly every month this year. In August, the country’s oil production hit a record 11.35 million barrels per day (bpd). Houston-based EOG produced 415,000 bpd in the quarter ended Sept. 30, up 27 percent from the year-earlier period. EOG raised its estimate of full-year oil production growth to 19 percent. EOG also lifted its spending budget for 2018 to between $5.8 billion and $6 billion, up from $5.4 billion to $5.8 billion previously. The company said the larger budget would allow it to “retain high performing service providers” through the end of the year, and provide service continuity into 2019. The company said it has secured 65 percent of its expected 2019 services. The uptick in spending comes as oil and gas companies have been pressured by investors to rein in costs and focus on boosting shareholder returns. Although EOG lifted its 2018 spending guidance, the company also said it was on track to reduce total well costs by 5 percent this year. EOG reported adjusted net income of $1 billion, or $1.75 per share, versus $111 million a year ago. Analysts had anticipated the producer to earn an adjusted $1.52 per share in the third quarter, according to Refinitiv data. Revenue for the quarter totaled $4.78 billion, up about 81 percent. Shares were down slightly in after-market trading, at $106.85. They had closed at $106.89 on Thursday."

The Houston-based company raised its 2018 capital spending budget to between $5.8 billion and $6 billion, from $5.4 billion to $5.8 billion, and said it expects to complete 720 wells in 2018, 20 more than originally expected."
-24.92001903079891," EOG warns oil and gas hedges will hurt third-quarter results HOUSTON (Reuters) - U.S. shale oil producer EOG Resources on Tuesday warned of a non-cash loss of $52.1 million in the third quarter on commodity derivative contracts in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. The Houston-based company attributed the hit to a difference between its realized price for crude oil and natural gas sales during the quarter, and the prices due at NYMEX delivery locations. Benchmark crude prices averaged $69.50 a barrel during the quarter, EOG said in the filing. It hedged 134,000 barrels per day, or about 35 percent of its prior period’s production, at roughly $60 a barrel. Analysts still anticipate EOG to report a profit of $1.48 per share in the third quarter compared with a profit of 19 cents in the same quarter last year, according to Refinitiv I/B/E/S. Losses from hedging contracts will be prevalent in the third quarter across the shale oil and gas industry, said Ben Montalbano, co-founder of Denver based analytics firm PetroNerds. “This is probably one of the less severe numbers you’ll see this quarter. A lot of their peers have hedged a larger portion of production and done so at a lower price,” he said. For the roughly 40 companies PetroNerds tracks, the aggregate of swaps and collars were under $60 a barrel, he added. Last quarter, several producers, including Devon Energy Corp, Anadarko Petroleum Corp and Pioneer Natural Resources, reported losses after missing bets on oil prices. Then, many had hedged around $55 a barrel, but were burned when oil climbed to more than $70 a barrel."
-13.212628208802366," Mercuria-backed Tailwind buys EOG's UK oil, gas assets LONDON (Reuters) - Tailwind Energy, which is financially backed by energy trader Mercuria, bought U.S. group EOG Resources' EOG.N British offshore oil and gas field assets, Tailwind said. Tailwind, who partners with Mercuria on finance and marketing and oil services firm Petrofac PFC.L on technology, did not disclose how much it paid. Banking sources told Reuters in April the assets could fetch more than $300 million. “Tailwind will own and operate 100 percent of the producing Conwy oilfield, a 25 percent non-operated interest in the Columbus gas development project and other minor asset interests in the North Sea,” Tailwind said in a statement. Tailwind’s overall output will reach around 15,000 barrels per day once the deal, which requires regulatory approval, is completed. According to documents seen by Reuters in April, the Conwy field, which produced around 11,000 barrels of oil per day in February, “provides immediate positive tax-free cashflow.” The field has around 10.9 million barrels of reserves. The Columbus field is on track to start production “as early as 2019”, representing “a robust growth opportunity albeit with minimal near-term firm commitments,” according to the documents. EOG has expanded its U.S. portfolio in recent years."
-16.237226191297317," EOG sees Permian hydraulic fracturing work slowing in second half HOUSTON (Reuters) - Independent oil and gas producer EOG Resources EOG.N on Friday said Delaware Basin completions will make up a smaller percentage of its overall hydraulic fracturing work in late 2018, a signal that pipeline constraints may continue to choke growth in the largest U.S. shale play. Activity in the Permian Basin, which includes the Delaware, has outpaced pipeline takeaway capacity in recent months as U.S. oil production has hit record highs. The pipeline constraints have pushed down the price of local oil and prompted some companies to reallocate resources to other basins. EOG said Delaware completions made up about 40 percent of its total hydraulic fracturing work during the first half of the year, but expected that to decline to 30 percent in the second half of 2018. Conversely, the company expects completions in Wyoming’s Powder River Basin, North Dakota’s Bakken, and Colorado’s DJ basin to climb from 10 percent to 20 percent of its total hydraulic fracturing work in the second half. Noble Energy NBL.N on Friday said it would slow Permian hydraulic fracturing completions during the second half of the year, shifting more resources to the DJ basin. Shares of EOG were down about 3.2 percent at $121.92 at 11:48 a.m. eastern (1548 GMT). EOG this week said it was expanding its presence in Wyoming’s Powder River Basin, tapping into the Mowry and Niobrara resource plays, in addition to the Turner formation. That basin is now the company’s third largest asset. The company said it is designing a gas gathering and compression system to facilitate takeaway away from the Powder River Basin. EOG is also evaluating opportunities to move crude from the Powder River Basin to the U.S. Gulf Coast, executives told analysts during the company’s quarterly earnings call. Anadarko Petroleum Corp APC.N this week also said it was growing its footprint in the Powder River Basin."

-18.57856339206469," UPDATE 1-EOG Resources profit jumps, but falls below analysts' forecast (Adds details from earnings release) HOUSTON, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Oil and gas producer EOG Resources Inc on Thursday reported sharply higher second-quarter profit, but missed Wall Street per-share estimates, earning $1.20 compared with analysts’ expectations for $1.23. EOG grew its total crude production by 15 percent from a year ago to a company record of 384,600 barrels per day, pushing profit for the quarter to $696.7 million from $23.1 million a year earlier. The company said it was targeting 18 percent growth in its crude production for the year. U.S. producers are benefiting from a bump in oil activity, as benchmark U.S. crude futures have climbed almost 40 percent in the past year to around $70 a barrel. EOG said it increased crude derivative contracts during the second quarter, and received an average crude and condensate price of $67.91, up from $47.51 a year ago. Results at rivals including Devon Energy Corp and Anadarko Petroleum Corp took a hit during the quarter because of the settlement of commodity derivatives. Companies hedged production at about $55 a barrel, losing out on revenue gains from market prices that rose above $70 a barrel last quarter. EOG also said it increased its estimated resource potential in Wyoming’s Powder River Basin oil field to 2.1 billion barrels of oil equivalent. That basin is now its third largest asset, the company said. EOG said it would operate a two-rig program in the Powder River Basin during 2018 and would expand its drilling activity next year. It is targeting well costs between $4.5 million and $6.1 million per well. The company reported net operating revenues of $4.24 billion, up from $2.61 billion a year ago. Anadarko said this week it had grown its footprint in the Powder River Basin to 300,000 acres (121,400 hectares) and had begun an appraisal effort for the development of oil production there.

11.41148114424468," Exclusive: EOG seeking to pull out of British North Sea LONDON/HOUSTON (Reuters) - U.S. oil and gas producer EOG Resources Inc is selling its British offshore business, a document seen by Reuters showed, as the company heightens its focus on its fast-growing U.S. shale portfolio. A spokesman for Houston-based EOG confirmed the sale process to Reuters. The business includes a 100 percent interest in the Conwy oilfield in the east Irish sea and a 25 percent stake in the Columbus gas project in the North Sea, according to the document. Investment bank Jefferies is running the sale process. Together, the assets could fetch over $300 million, according to banking sources. Jefferies declined to comment. “I can confirm that we have it up for sale,” EOG spokeswoman Kim Ehmer told Reuters. The Conwy field, which produced around 11,000 barrels of oil per day in February, “provides immediate positive tax-free cashflow,” the document said. The field has around 10.9 million barrels of reserves. The Columbus field is on track to start production “as early as 2019”, representing “a robust growth opportunity albeit with minimal near-term firm commitments.” EOG is also withdrawing from all its remaining exploration acreage in the North Sea. Bids for the portfolio are due by June 2018. EOG, considered one of the most-technology savvy U.S. shale producers, has been steadily growing its U.S. portfolio in recent years and is now the largest shale oil producer in Texas as well as the entire United States. It pumped 551,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day last year across the United States, including operations in Texas as well as North Dakota’s Bakken shale formation."
