5.531178763999264," UPDATE 2-Diabetes drugmaker Novo Nordisk upbeat on 2021, sees Biden boost * Sees 2021 sales in local currencies up 5-9% * Sees 2021 op profit in local currencies up 4-8% * Q4 results in line with expectations (Adds CEO quote) COPENHAGEN, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Diabetes drugmaker Novo Nordisk forecast a rise in underlying sales and profit for 2021 on Wednesday and said it expected more Americans to get access to its drugs under the new Biden administration. Novo Nordisk, the world’s biggest manufacturer of diabetes drugs, posted fourth-quarter results in line with expectations, as more patients began treatment with its drugs even as some existing ones used stocks built up at the start of the pandemic. Rival Eli Lilly said last week it had seen strong demand for diabetes drugs in the fourth quarter. However, Novo said higher U.S. unemployment had hit sales as some patients were pushed out of corporate insurance plans, leaving them to rely on other insurance coverage such as the government-run Medicaid or pay for diabetes drugs themselves. “It’s clear that under the new Biden administration, healthcare is high on the agenda,” Chief Executive Lars Fruergaard said at a conference call. U.S. President Joe Biden has given more Americans access to government healthcare insurance programmes. “What we saw with Obamacare was that it led to bigger volumes, but also a higher cost to the industry to fund those volumes,” Fruergaard said, referring to the health insurance programme introduced by former U.S. president Barack Obama. Novo said it expected 2021 sales in local currencies to rise by 5%-9% and operating profit by 4%-8%. But currency headwinds are expected to reduce sales growth by 4 percentage points when reported in Danish crowns, while operating profit growth will be 6 percentage points lower, the company forecast. Operating profit for October-December fell 6% from a year earlier to 11.2 billion Danish crowns ($1.81 billion), in line with analysts’ forecast. Novo’s sales stood at 32.1 billion crowns in the quarter, compared with analysts’ average estimate of 31.8 billion."
1.1275104765714654," Novo Nordisk to start late-stage trial of semaglutide to treat Alzheimer's COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Diabetes drugmaker Novo Nordisk will start a late-stage clinical trial to test its semaglutide drug as a treatment for early Alzheimer’s disease, it said on Wednesday. Novo shares were up 4.3% at 1418 GMT following the news. Sydbank analyst Soeren Loentoft described the move as a “good signal”, showing Novo’s confidence in the drug, but warned developing treatments for Alzheimer’s was notoriously difficult. “Many have tried without success in the last many years, so this is a high-risk study, and it is by no means certain that Novo’s semaglutide will have an effect,” he said. The drug, a so-called GLP-1 analogue, works by stimulating insulin production in patients with type 2 diabetes, the most common form of the disease. “Due to the growing unmet medical need and the increasing evidence of a potential therapeutic role for GLP-1, we will investigate the benefits of oral semaglutide in early Alzheimer’s disease,” Novo Chief Scientific Officer Mads Krogsgaard said in a statement. The company said animal studies had shown semaglutide reduced neuroinflammation, which has an effect on cognition and function, and improved memory function. Earlier human trials also showed a statistically significant reduction in the development of dementia within a small patient group, Novo said. The phase IIIa trial, which will study the efficacy and safety of a daily 14 milligram dose of oral semaglutide, is set to start in the first half of 2021 and include about 3,700 people, Novo said. The company’s once-daily pill-version of semaglutide has been approved to treat type 2 diabetes in the United States, Europe and Japan."
1.478113265470047," Novo Nordisk to boost pill-form diabetic drugs with $1.8 billion deal COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Diabetes drug maker Novo Nordisk said on Friday it had agreed a $1.8 billion deal to acquire Emisphere Technologies, giving it control of a pill technology that it hopes will broaden sales to diabetics with an aversion to shots. The acquisition comes as Novo's NOVOb.CO new diabetes pill, Rybelsus - its first-of-a-kind, non-injectable treatment - has been approved by regulators in the United States, Europe and several Asian countries. The world’s biggest producer of diabetes drugs aims to offer more of its current and future drugs in a tablet form. “I don’t think we will ever completely get rid of the needles,” Chief Scientific Officer Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen said in an interview. “We have been making injection drugs for a hundred years, but we just have to admit that if we want patients to get treatment quickly in order to optimise the long-term course of the illness, then it requires tablets if possible,” he said. Under the deal, Novo will buy all outstanding shares in U.S.-based Emisphere for $1.35 billion, while also taking over royalty obligations to the firm’s biggest shareholder worth $450 million Novo said it will make “substantial investments” into the platform and already has around one hundred scientists at its Copenhagen-headquarters working on improving the tablet technology. “By further developing the technology, we hope in the future to produce the medicine cheaper than we do now, thus allowing us to penetrate more markets and give broader access to diabetes drugs,” Thomsen said."
1.478113265470047," Denmark's Novo Nordisk to buy Emisphere Technologies in $1.8 billion deal COPENHAGEN, Nov 6 (Reuters) - Danish diabetes drug maker Novo Nordisk will acquire U.S. Emisphere Technologies, which specialises in developing orally administered versions of drugs, in a deal totalling $1.8 billion, it said on Friday. Novo Nordisk will buy all outstanding shares in Emisphere at a price of $1.35 billion, while also taking over royalty obligations to the firms biggest shareholder worth $450 million, which makes the total acquisition price $1.8 billion. “The acquisition of Emisphere provides Novo Nordisk full ownership of the Eligen SNAC technology, which has been successfully used under a licence agreement to develop the first oral biologic, Rybelsus,” Chief Scientific Officer Mads Krogsgaard said in a statement."
8.937233963362656," Novo Nordisk sales rise as more diabetics seek treatment COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Drugmaker Novo Nordisk NOVOb.CO has seen a gradual recovery in the number of diabetics starting treatment, it said on Friday after reporting 2% sales growth in the third quarter. Many patients had postponed doctor visits earlier in the year due to coronavirus lockdown measures, but Novo Nordisk had said earlier this month that the negative impact from COVID-19 had been smaller than expected, prompting it to raise its full-year guidance. Sales are still feeling the effects of patient stockpiling at the start of the coronavirus crisis, but the Copenhagen-based company, the world’s biggest manufacturer of diabetes drugs, said sales growth had been driven by higher demand for its innovative GLP-1 drugs, which imitate an intestinal hormone that stimulates production of insulin. “Many more patients are coming into that market and getting the benefits of GLP-1 treatment,” Chief Executive Lars Fruergaard said on a conference call with journalists. The company, which on Friday retained its full-year outlook, hopes to gradually replace its U.S. insulin business with the new GLP-1 diabetes drugs. Fruergaard said that while fewer diabetics had initiated drug treatment this year, a “gradual recovery” had taken place during the third quarter. “We assume that will continue into the fourth quarter, but the guidance range reflects that we live in very volatile times. We don’t know how the winter season will evolve,” he said. The company expects full-year operating profit to grow by between 1% and 4% and sales to grow between 2% and 5%. Quarterly sales reached 30.9 billion Danish crowns ($4.9 billion), while operating profit declined 1% to 12.8 billion crowns, both in line with third-quarter figures published this month."
-2.5114430871425375," European stocks rise on upbeat forecasts from Pandora, Novo Nordisk (For a live blog on European stocks, type LIVE/ in an Eikon news window) Oct 9 (Reuters) - European stock markets gained on Friday on rosy earnings forecasts from retailers Pandora and Zalando as well as drugmaker Novo Nordisk, with investors keeping an eye out for signs of fresh U.S. stimulus. Danish jewellery maker Pandora jumped 10.6% and German online fashion company Zalando rose 3.7% after raising their outlook for 2020 on the back of a strong third quarter. Danish pharma company Novo Nordisk gained 3.2% after it raised its 2020 sales and operating outlook. The broader STOXX 600 index rose 0.4% by 0713 GMT, led by miners and oil companies as commodity prices rose. The index was on course to record its second straight week of gains. U.S. President Donald Trump said in an interview with Fox News that talks with Congress have restarted over further COVID-19 relief and that there was a good chance a deal could be reached. But he gave no other details about a possible agreement."
11.335172943491607," Novo Nordisk tweaks outlook higher after pandemic sales hit COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Diabetes drug maker Novo Nordisk NOVOb.CO raised its full-year earnings outlook slightly on Thursday as it managed to offset stagnant sales with cost cuts during the coronavirus crisis. The Danish company, whose shares rose 1%, said second quarter sales were hit by fewer patients starting treatments as well as coronavirus-related destocking, after its first quarter was boosted by a surge in demand for medicines. “Despite COVID-19, we are satisfied by the performance in the first half of 2020 and by the progress made on our strategic aspirations,” CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen said in a statement. Novo said it now expects annual operating profit growth in the range of 2%-5%, up from an earlier estimate of 1%-5% growth. Novo’s operating profit was 13.8 billion Danish crowns ($2.19 billion), compared to an average 13.31 billion expected by analysts. This was helped by lower costs, chief financial officer Karsten Munk Knudsen told reporters, which were achieved through less travel and promotional expenses, netting Novo savings of around 1 billion crowns. But Knudsen said reversals of bulked up inventories, worth 2 billion crowns, would continue into 2021. At 30 billion crowns, Novo’s sales were flat compared to the same period last year and were below analyst estimates of 30.7 billion crowns. They dropped from 33.9 billion reported for the first quarter of 2020. Sales in the U.S., Novo’s largest single market, grew 1% compared to 12% in the rest of the world. Novo hopes to gradually replace its U.S. insulin business with its new GLP-1 diabetes drugs, which imitate an intestinal hormone that stimulates the production of insulin. “The weight of U.S. insulin becomes smaller and smaller in our business, so gradually we’ll also expect to get back to growth in the U.S.” Jorgensen said. Sales of GLP-1 products in the first half of 2020 rose by 30% globally, while insulin sales slid 3%."

3.956600120177923," Novo Nordisk expands into cardiovascular disease with $725 million deal COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Novo Nordisk NOVOb.CO has agreed to buy AstraZeneca spin-off Corvidia Therapeutics for an initial $725 million as the world's largest diabetes drugmaker seeks to expand into cardiovascular disease treatments. The acquisition is in line with Novo’s strategy to diversify its portfolio and gain a foothold in markets for drugs closely linked to its core therapeutic areas of diabetes and obesity. “Novo Nordisk has in recent years formulated a clearer strategy in cardiovascular diseases,” Novo’s chief science officer Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen said in an interview. Corvidia’s leading drug candidate, ziltivekimab, is in mid-stage clinical trials. Novo expects the drug to come to market in the latter half of this decade. With some 500 million patients worldwide, cardiovascular diseases are more widespread than diabetes, Krogsgaard said. Some 70% of deaths among diabetics sufferers are caused by cardiovascular diseases, killing more people than cancer, Novo Nordisk says. “This acquisition underlines that Novo slowly is moving into neighbouring areas to diabetes and obesity,” Krogsgaard said. “The world is moving more towards a more holistic treatment paradigm, instead of treating just individual symptoms,” he said. Krogsgaard would not give an estimate of potential peak sales of the drug, which he called “first and best in class”. Novo said it would fund the deal from financial reserves and that it would not affect its full-year financial guidance or share buyback programme. Total payments to Corvidia’s shareholders could be $2.1 billion if certain regulatory and sales milestones are reached, it said."

2.758954572498097," Novo Nordisk's drug sales boosted by virus-related stockpiling COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - The world’s top maker of diabetes drugs Novo Nordisk beat profit and sales forecasts in the first quarter and kept its full-year outlook as diabetics stocking up during the coronavirus pandemic led to a surge in demand for its medicines. Novo Nordisk joined U.S. rival Eli Lilly and other drugmakers in keeping or even raising full-year forecasts as lockdowns to combat the spread of the virus lead to stockpiling of drugs. “COVID-19 related stocking at patient levels significantly impacted our results, however, we are satisfied with the underlying performance,” Chief Executive Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen told journalists on Wednesday. First-quarter sales jumped 14% to 33.9 billion Danish crowns ($4.9 billion) measured in local currencies, beating the 31.5 billion crowns forecast by analysts, but growth would have been only half that level without COVID-19-related stockpiling. The higher stock levels would be gradually reversed during the remainder of the year and in 2021. Operating profit came in at 16.3 billion crowns, compared to an average 14.2 billion crowns expected by analysts. Shares in the Danish company, which have gained almost 40% in value over the past year, rose around 2% in early trading. Novo still expects sales to grow between 3% and 6% and operating profit to rise 1%-5% this year, both measured in local currencies, despite uncertainties stemming from the outbreak as fewer patients visit their doctor at times of social distancing. “The number of people getting diabetes is not changing so the patients are there but it is clear that when healthcare systems are focused on COVID-19 there is less initiation of new patients,” Jorgensen said. He said there would probably be a “pool of patients” waiting to get treated for type 2 diabetes after the pandemic. Novo said the outlook was based on the assumption that patient flows would normalise in the third and fourth quarter. It was also uncertain how the staggeringly high U.S. unemployment numbers would impact sales if many patients either lose health insurance coverage or opt for lower-income schemes. “The current COVID-19 pandemic causes uncertainty to the outlook regarding patient flow and societal impacts such as the unemployment rate in the US which is impacting healthcare insurance coverage,” it said. Eli Lilly said last month it could see lower payments for its drugs if patients shift to Medicaid - the federal and states-run plan for low-income individuals."

-1.987274442969238," Novo Nordisk sees slower 2020 growth with U.S. insulin prices pressured COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Diabetes drug maker Novo Nordisk NOVOb.CO said on Wednesday it expects its business to grow at a slower pace in 2020 compared to last year with insulin prices in the United States likely to remain under pressure. The world’s top maker of diabetes drugs is betting on innovative new treatments to offset pricing pressure from competing insulin products and U.S. lawmakers, who have been critical of rising drug costs. The company said it expects sales to grow between 3% and 6% and operating profit to rise 1-5% this year, both measured in local currencies. In comparison, last year both sales and operating profit rose by 6%. “We are very satisfied with the financial performance in 2019,” Chief Executive Officer Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen said on a conference call, adding that the launch of its once-daily oral pill Rybelsus late last year in the U.S. market was “off to a good start”. Despite the positive launch of both Rybelsus and the once-weekly injectable treatment Ozempic in the United States, which makes up half of the company’s total revenue, sales in that market were largely flat last year as a result of lower insulin prices, it said. “We see a tough environment in the U.S. insulin market going into 2020,” Chief Financial Officer Karsten Munk Knudsen said on the call, noting that the company is in the middle of a “major transformation” of its U.S. business. The company said it expected new type 2 diabetes drugs, which imitate an intestinal hormone that stimulates the production of insulin, and obesity drugs to drive growth going forward. It posted a fourth-quarter operating profit of 11.9 billion Danish crowns ($1.75 billion), compared to an average 12.0 billion crowns expected by analysts. Sales were 32.4 billion crowns in the quarter versus 31.9 billion forecast by analysts. “Today’s result is in line with expectations and neither the figures nor guidance deviate from what was expected,” said Nordnet analyst Per Hansen. Shares were trading 0.5% higher at 0823 GMT compared to a flat Copenhagen market .OMXC25CAP. The stock has gained around one-third in value over the past year and is trading close to its highest since August 2015."

4.109811660126622," European drug panel recommends approving Novo Nordisk's new diabetes pill (Reuters) - A panel of the European medicines regulator has recommended approving Novo Nordisk’s new diabetes pill, Rybelsus, further boosting prospects for the Danish drugmaker with its first-of-a-kind, non-injectable treatment. The European Medicines Agency said here its human medicines committee (CHMP) adopted a positive opinion on the treatment, chemically called semaglutide, for the treatment of type-2 diabetes - the most common form of the disease. The recommendation follows a U.S. FDA approval in September. Novo Nordisk hopes to capitalize on the treatment by selling it to diabetics with an aversion to shots, as it does not need to be injected. While final approvals are up to the European Commission, it generally follows the CHMP’s recommendation and endorses them within a couple of months. The company expects to receive final marketing authorization in the beginning of the second quarter. Novo, the world’s biggest producer of diabetes drugs, already sells an injectable, once-weekly version of semaglutide under the brand name Ozempic. The oral version is meant to be taken once a day, along with diet and exercise regimens to control blood sugar levels. Semaglutide belongs to a class of medicines called GLP-1, which stimulate insulin production in patients with type-2 diabetes by imitating an intestinal hormone. Novo Nordisk reports 2019 results next week. U.S. sales of Rybelsus began in the fourth quarter, and at the time of the FDA approval, brokerage Pareto Securities pegged 2026 sales to be at least 36.6 billion Danish crowns ($5.43 billion)."

1.6278304269609918," Novo Nordisk to offer free insulin to U.S. patients in immediate need (Reuters) - Novo Nordisk said on Thursday it would offer free, one-time supply of insulin to people in immediate need and at risk of rationing the medication, the rising price of which has attracted fierce criticism from lawmakers and regulators. Novo said prn.to/36kkhaq patients with prescription can get a free, one-time supply of up to three vials or two packs of pens of its insulin, after which they should find a longer-term solution from its other affordability offerings. The drugmaker said in September U.S. patients can buy three vials or two packs of pens of its analog insulins for $99, following similar moves by rivals Sanofi SA and Eli Lilly and Co. The cost of insulin for treating type 1 diabetes in the United States had nearly doubled from 2012 to 2016, leading some patients to put their health at risk by rationing the medication. Last year, following heavy criticism over the prices, Eli Lilly started selling a half-price version of its Humalog insulin and Sanofi said it would cut the cost of its insulin products to $99 per month for some patients. Novo on Thursday also announced the launch of cheaper versions of its heavily prescribed insulin drug, Novolog."
7.739992478594298," Novo Nordisk nudges up 2019 sales outlook as new drugs excel COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Novo Nordisk NOVOb.CO posted third-quarter operating profit a touch below expectations on Friday on weak insulin sales and impairments, but nudged up its sales outlook on hopes for new type 2 diabetes and obesity drugs. Novo now sees 2019 sales growth at 5-6% versus 4-6% previously, and held its forecast for operating profit growth at 4-6%, both in local currency terms. It said operating profit rose 9% in the last quarter, slightly below analysts’ forecasts. Shares in the healthcare group traded up 1.6% at 0923 GMT, outperforming a 0.3% rise in the broader European STOXX 600 index .STOXX and a 1.4% increase in Copenhagen's main index .OMXC25CAP. The world’s largest maker of diabetes drugs is betting on new treatments, including a first-of-its-kind tablet, to offset pricing pressure from competing insulins and U.S. lawmakers, who have been critical of rising drug costs. Sales of its new once-weekly injectable treatment, branded Ozempic, reached 6,872 million Danish crowns ($1.03 billion) for the first nine months, attaining blockbuster status. Ozempic’s third-quarter sales came in 11% stronger than expected, said Jefferies analysts The new drug is a competitor of Eli Lilly’s Trulicity. Both drugs belong to the GLP-1 drug class, which imitate an intestinal hormone that stimulates the production of insulin. These drugs are more expensive but make up a growing share of the diabetes market, as they have proved effective in reducing diabetes patients’ blood glucose levels and weight. “We believe we have the better product both in terms of glucose lowering, weight (reduction) and the cardiovascular safety profile,” said chief financial officer Karsten Munk Knudsen, referring to clinical trials. “Our sales reps have what they need to go into the market and compete vis-a-vis with Trulicity,” he said, adding that Novo is taking market share from Eli Lilly in the GLP-1 market. Competition in the GLP-1 space is set to further increase as Novo recently won approval for its once-daily oral pill Rybelsus, which is aimed at patients with an aversion to needles used to deliver other diabetes treatments. Third-quarter Trulicity sales fell short of Wall Street expectations with some analysts suggesting they were likely hurt by Lilly’s efforts to defend its market share against the upcoming launch of Rybelsus. Novo’s third-quarter operating profit came in at 12.9 billion Danish crowns ($1.93 billion), slightly below the 13.1 billion forecast in a Refinitiv poll partly due to higher impairment charges.. Depreciation, amortization and impairment losses this year are now seen 1 billion crowns higher than previously anticipated, Novo said.

8.854067063297698," Novo Nordisk targets bigger slice of diabetes market with new tablet COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk NOVOb.CO is aiming for a big slice of the multibillion-dollar diabetes market with a new pill, approved by U.S. authorities on Friday, that caters for patients with an aversion to needles. The company built its position as the world’s biggest insulin maker on the back of injectable drugs, but now aims to transform the market with a first-of-its-kind tablet version of its semaglutide drug. While more than 70% of diabetes prescriptions in the United States are already for oral treatments, none of these are from the GLP-1 class that Novo specializes in, and which are viewed as highly effective medicines that stimulate insulin production. “We have only worked with around 25% of the patients so far and we see it as a breakthrough because we can now also address the tablet-based market,” chief scientific officer Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen told Reuters on Monday. Investors have been concerned the once-daily pill, known as Rybelsus, would be sold more cheaply than comparable injectable treatments as Novo tries to secure a foothold in the tablet market, where drugs tend to be cheaper. However, chief financial officer Karsten Munk Knudsen told analysts the monthly price would be similar to the company’s once-weekly injectable version of semaglutide, Ozempic, which has a list price of nearly $800 per month. “Overall this removes a concern that the company would have been forced much lower on price,” said Bernstein analyst Wimal Kapadia, who has an ‘outperform’ rating on Novo shares. Competitors include Eli Lilly's LLY.N injectable Trulicity and Merck's MRK.N Januvia, an oral medication known chemically as sitagliptin. A study last year showed Novo's tablet was superior to Januvia in demonstrating reductions in both long-term blood sugar level and weight. “We have a very strong position if you look at the leading tablet treatments in the market,” Thomsen said. Novo hopes to convince doctors that Rybelsus, which brokerage Pareto estimates will have sales of at least 36.6 billion Danish crowns ($5.4 billion) in 2026, provides a new weapon to tackle diabetes earlier, and highly effectively. Thomsen said the U.S. approval was a triumph of perseverance. “We were laughed at when we told our peers about it. They thought we had eaten or smoked something weird,” he said of the early plans for the drug. The name Rybelsus was picked because of its similarity to the word rebellious. “There is a revolt against why biological drugs should always be treated through injections,” said Thomsen."
9.557999569189583," UPDATE 2-Novo Nordisk wins U.S. approval for first-of-its-kind oral diabetes drug (Adds details on drug, background) Sept 20 (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Friday approved an oral version of Novo Nordisk’s diabetes drug semaglutide, a boost for the Danish drugmaker which hopes to transform the market by offering patients a non-injectable treatment. Copenhagen-listed shares of the company rose 2.6% in late European trading. The world’s biggest producer of diabetes drugs already sells an injectable once-weekly version of semaglutide under the brand name Ozempic at nearly $800 per month. Novo did not disclose what it plans to charge for the new oral treatment, called Rybelsus, but said it would be “competitively priced” with other drugs in the same “GLP-1” class of medicines. Eli Lilly and Co's Trulicity, an injectable rival, has a list price of $759.40 per month, according to Lilly's website. (bit.ly/2kWYNhn) Rybelsus, which will be available in the United States in the fourth quarter, stimulates insulin production in patients with type 2 diabetes, the most common form of the disease, and is meant to be taken once a day. (bit.ly/2kWSKJH) Novo is betting on the success of its launch as the company faces pricing pressures from competitors and U.S. lawmakers, who have been critical of rising drug costs. The approval makes Rybelsus the first drug of its class on the market that does not have to be injected, an advantage Novo hopes to capitalize on, as it sells to diabetics with an aversion to shots. “The oral administration is likely to make oral semaglutide competitive for quite some time,” Pareto Securities analyst Johan Unnerus said. The closest competition is probably Novo’s Ozempic, Lilly’s Trulicity and, in some way, Merck & Co Inc’s Januvia, he added. The brokerage expects Rybelsus sales of at least DKK 36.6 billion ($5.40 billion) in 2026. The drug’s label comes with a boxed warning, the FDA’s harshest, flagging a potential increased risk of thyroid c-cell tumors. It also states that Rybelsus is not recommended as the first choice of medicine for treating diabetes. Novo has invested in manufacturing facilities in North Carolina to supply the U.S. market with the oral pill. The company said it plans to source initial supply from Denmark, but would manufacture Rybelsus in the United States in future.

7.973363461773484," Novo Nordisk to cut insulin prices in the U.S. COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Novo Nordisk will offer cheaper insulin to U.S. diabetics, the Danish drugmaker said on Friday, in response to criticism over the high price of the medication and after similar moves by rivals Sanofi and Eli Lilly. President Donald Trump has made high prescription drug prices a top issue in the 2016 presidential campaign and said that drug companies were “getting away with murder”. Novo will offer a generic version of its most heavily prescribed insulin drug Novolog, used by about a million U.S. patients, at a 50% discount compared to the current list price, the company said in a statement. The list price for one vial will be $144.68. Novo will also introduce a so-called $99 cash card program from Jan 2020, which patients can use to buy three vials or two packs of pens of Novo’s analog insulins for a flat cost of $99, which for most diabetics is an adequate supply for one month. The cost of insulin for treating type 1 diabetes in the United States has nearly doubled over a five-year period, leading some patients to put their own health at risk by rationing the medication. “While we will continue to do what we can to help address affordability challenges in the short-term, changes within the system are required to make sustainable and meaningful affordability a reality,” said Novo in a statement. In April, France’s Sanofi said it would cut the cost of its insulin products to $99 per month for uninsured patients and others who pay cash in the United States. Eli Lilly started selling a half-price version of its Humalog insulin in May. The list price for Lilly’s authorized generic insulin -- sold under the name Insulin Lispro -- is $137.35 per vial.

10.878825948136111," Novo Nordisk contests Danish lawsuit claiming $1.75 billion COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Danish insulin-maker Novo Nordisk NOVOb.CO said it would fight a lawsuit filed in a Danish court on Friday which alleges the company made misleading statements about its insulin business in the United States, the company said in a statement. “Novo Nordisk disagrees with the allegations and is prepared to defend the company in this matter,” the company said. The securities lawsuit was filed by a number of shareholders who claims compensation worth a total of 11.785 billion Danish crowns ($1.75 billion) based on trading of Novo shares for two years from February 2015. Filed in the Danish district court of Glostrup, the lawsuit alleges Novo Nordisk did not make “appropriate disclosures regarding its sales of insulin products in the USA,” Novo said. Lawyer Thomas Ryhl, representing about 260 pension funds behind the lawsuit, said Novo failed to tell the entire truth behind the company’s increased revenue in the United States. “They did, but they did it too late. What they said in 2016, they should have said already in 2014 and 2015,” he said. The news had little immediate impact of Novo’s shares which traded up 1% at 1345 GMT. “It is a very complex case and it’s not black-and-white. I am far from certain, that Novo will lose this case,” Sydbank’s analyst Soren Lontoft Hansen told Reuters. “It will be a large fine if they do, but Novo has a strong financial foundation,” Hansen added. According to Ryhl, Novo’s revenue from insulin sales in the U.S. increased between 2015 and 2017, but Novo’s rebates to pharmacy benefit managers equally rose in the same period. “Actually, Novo’s profits from its insulin sales dropped, even though prices and sales increased,” he told Reuters. In the period between February 2015 and February 2017, Novo’s share price jumped between 220 and 410 Danish crowns. Novo said the Danish lawsuit contained “broadly similar” allegations to those of a previously announced securities class-action lawsuit filed in the US in 2017 against the company. That ongoing lawsuit alleges Novo has misled investors and colluded with industry peers to increase drug prices and artificially inflate its financial results, according to Novo."

16.14614095955522," Novo Nordisk's new diabetes, obesity drugs lift sales outlook COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Novo Nordisk NOVOb.CO raised its sales forecast for this year thanks to growing demand for obesity drugs and a new injectable treatment for diabetes, now its growth engine as insulin sales decline. The Danish company is pinning its hopes on a relatively new treatment for type 2 diabetes as its older insulin drugs face political pressure over the soaring cost of the life-sustaining medicine in the United States. Sales of its new once-weekly injectable treatment, branded Ozempic, rose to 2.3 billion Danish crowns ($345 million) in the second quarter, which was higher than expected by analysts, sending shares in the world’s top diabetes drugmaker 1.4% higher in early trading on Friday. “The launch of Ozempic is expanding the GLP-1 market, and we are encouraged by the positive market reception in both North America and Europe,” Chief Executive Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen said. Ozempic belongs to the GLP-1 drug class, which imitate an intestinal hormone that stimulates the production of insulin, and makes up a growing share of the diabetes market. Novo, an early mover together with Eli Lilly LLY.N in the sector, has a 46% share of the global GLP-1 market. It now expects 2019 total sales growth of 4-6%, up from a previous 2-5%, and operating profit growth of 4-6% compared to the previously stated 2-6%, both measured in local currency. Jorgensen said the upper end of its operating profit outlook stayed unchanged due to investments in marketing of new products and research and development. This includes four new late-stage clinical trials with semaglutide in people with type 2 diabetes and other complications, including cardiovascular disease, diabetic retinopathy and chronic kidney disease. While its new drug continued to shine, uncertainty remained in the United States where the Trump administration and other lawmakers have introduced several proposals aimed at lowering healthcare costs for U.S. consumers, some of which have already been scrapped. Americans pay the highest prices for prescription drugs in the world as most other developed nations have single-payer systems in which the government negotiates drug prices for its people. “We see that insulins actually become cheaper and cheaper in the United States for those who buy them but unfortunately not for the patients who can not get access to the rebates,” Jorgensen said. “I think there is consensus across the aisles in Washington that something needs to be done but it’s very difficult to actually gain consensus,” he said. Novo posted a 10% rise in second-quarter operating profit to 13.5 billion Danish crowns ($2.03 billion), above an average 13.0 billion crowns forecast in a Reuters poll of analysts.."

The tablet version of its diabetes drug, known as semaglutide, is an important growth prospect for the Danish drugmaker, which faces pressure on prices from competitors and U.S. lawmakers who have been critical of rising drug costs. Novo, the world’s biggest producer of diabetes drugs, said the new plant near Durham would receive shipments of the active pharmaceutical ingredient needed to produce the pill from another factory under construction in North Carolina. “We want to build manufacturing capacity in the United States so that we can establish a local U.S. supply chain for oral semaglutide and other future oral products,” Novo Nordisk vice president Henrik Steen Jensen told Reuters. Novo submitted its oral semaglutide drug for approval in the United States in March, Jensen said. Asked when production at the plant near Durham would begin, Jensen said: “It will probably take a couple of years.” “It is in need of a rebuild, and after that it will take many months of testing and commissioning before we are ready to apply for FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) approval of the factory.” The tablet, which Novo currently produces only in Denmark, belongs to a blockbuster class of treatments known as GLP-1s that stimulate insulin production. So far, all have been via injection and a pill would make it quicker and easier for diabetics to take their medication. Novo said it bought the plant near Durham from Purdue Pharma but did not disclose the price or capacity."

-0.5739486573740552," Oral Novo Nordisk diabetes drug poses no more heart risk than placebo: study (Reuters) - An experimental oral form of a Novo Nordisk drug for type 2 diabetes posed no greater risk of serious heart problems or death than a placebo in patients at high risk for such complications, according to data from a large study presented on Tuesday. Patients with type 2 diabetics and either heart disease or at high risk for heart problems who received the drug semaglutide in pill form had a combined rate of heart attack, stroke or heart-related death of 3.8% compared with 4.8% for placebo, successfully demonstrating non-inferiority. Death from any cause occurred in 1.4% of semaglutide patients and 2.8% for placebo, according to data from the 3,183-patient trial presented at the American Diabetes Association meeting in San Francisco and published online by the New England Journal of Medicine. While the drug led to a lower rate of death and other heart problems, the trial was not designed to show statistically significant superiority, only that semaglutide was as safe as, or non-inferior to, placebo. Similar drugs have also shown an ability to cut the risk of cardiovascular problems. “The drug is safe,” Dr. Mansoor Husain, director of the Toronto General Hospital Research Institute who led the study, told Reuters Health in a phone interview. “This is the first orally-available GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) receptor agonist and that’s a pretty big deal,” Husain said, noting the fear many patients have for injections. “Just being able to take a pill every day makes it much more accessible.” Semaglutide, which stimulates insulin production, is seen as an important growth driver for Novo Nordisk, which funded the study known as Pioneer 6. The Danish drugmaker already sells an injectable once-weekly version of the drug under the brand name Ozempic at a cost of about $800 per month, according to the website goodrx.com. The oral version is a once-a-day tablet. Novo filed for U.S. approval for oral semaglutide in March. It is seeking priority review in hopes of getting approval within six months. All trial participants were at high risk of cardiovascular problems because they were at least 50 years old with established heart disease or chronic kidney disease, or at least age 60 with cardiovascular risk factors. They were followed for a median of 15.9 months. The trial was designed to end after a combination of at least 122 heart attacks, strokes and deaths had accrued. Individual cardiovascular events in the composite also showed no significant differences. The rate of non-fatal heart attack was 2.3% with semaglutide versus 1.9% with placebo, while the rate of non-fatal stroke was 0.8% with the drug and 1.0% for placebo. The odds of death from any cardiovascular cause were 0.9% in the semaglutide group and 1.9% in the placebo group. “We did see a 50% reduction in cardiovascular death and all-cause mortality, but these were secondary endpoints,” Husain said. The main goal of the study “was just to demonstrate safety,” he said. He cautioned people should not to read too much into the apparent reduction in the death risk. “We urge caution because they’re small numbers and it’s a relatively short-duration study.” The rate of patients dropping out of the trial was higher for those who received semaglutide - 11.6% compared with 6.5% for placebo - with gastrointestinal problems such as nausea and vomiting being the driving force. Those are common side effects for the GLP-1 class of diabetes medicines. (The story corrects paragraph eight to show Ozempic costs about $800 per month, not per week.)"
2.590007992969757," Novo Nordisk profit tops forecast as new diabetes drug shines COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk beat first-quarter operating profit forecasts on Friday, helped by higher sales of its biggest new drug hope, a treatment for type 2 diabetes. With Novo’s traditional insulin treatments facing U.S. price pressures and close to losing patent protection, the world’s biggest maker of diabetes drugs is pinning its hopes a once-a-week injection that helps reduce blood sugar and weight. Sales of the treatment, branded Ozempic, rose to 1.4 billion Danish crowns ($209 million) in the quarter, trumping analyst forecasts for 1.3 billion crowns. Ozempic, the newest drug in the so-called GLP-1 drug class, takes aim at Eli Lilly’s Trulicity, which has been taking market share from Novo’s former flagship treatment, once-a-day Victoza. “Based on our launch of Ozempic in the U.S. we see that we are stopping our loss in market share (of GLP-1 drugs),” Chief Executive Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen told reporters. However, Ozempic is also eating into sales of Victoza, which fell more than analysts’ expected in the quarter, although Jorgensen said the decline was in line with Novo’s projections. “We have never expected Victoza to keep growing when we launched Ozempic because it is just a much better product,” he said. Novo shares were steady at 0800 GMT, having recouped early losses. GLP-1 drugs, which imitate an intestinal hormone that stimulates the production of insulin, make up a growing share of the diabetes market, and Novo, an early mover together with Eli Lilly, has a 46.1 percent share of the market. The drugs have proved effective in reducing diabetes patients’ blood glucose levels and weight and have also showed cardiovascular benefits in studies. But on the downside, they drugs are more expensive than some other treatments. Novo’s first-quarter operating profit of 14.2 billion crowns beat analysts’ average forecast of 13.2 billion crowns, helped by a reversal of some writedowns.. The company kept its 2019 forecasts for sales growth of 2-5 percent and operating profit growth of 2-6 percent, both in local currencies. However, sales and operating profit growth in Danish crowns are now expected to be 3 and 5 percentage points higher than the local currency level, respectively, compared with previous guidance of 2 and 4 percentage points higher. Novo shares are trading at around 19 times forecast earnings, above the average multiple for the sector of roughly 16 times, according to Eikon Refinitiv data."

-5.317657684555875," Novo Nordisk and Gilead team up to test fatty liver disease treatment COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Novo Nordisk and Gilead Sciences will join forces on a clinical trial combining drugs from the two pharmaceutical firms to treat a progressive fatty liver disease known as NASH. The clinical trial will be a study combining Novo Nordisk’s semaglutide drug and Gilead’s cilofexor and firsocostat for treatment of patients with Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), Novo Nordisk, best known for its diabetes drugs, said on Friday. “NASH is a complex disease that often affects people with diabetes and metabolic syndrome. Currently, patients living with NASH have limited treatment options,” said Gilead’s chief scientific officer John McHutchison in a statement. In February, Gilead said a late-stage study of the experimental drug selonsertib aimed at treating NASH failed to meet its main goal. Analysts have projected the market for NASH treatments to reach $20 billion to $35 billion as populations increasingly develop the disease fueled by obesity and diabetes. Without treatment, sufferers can develop advanced damage, including the scarring known as fibrosis; cirrhosis, which destroys liver function; and even cancer.

The once-daily pill for treatment of type 2 diabetes is an important growth prospect for the Danish drugmaker, which faces pressure on prices from competitors and U.S. lawmakers, who have been critical of rising drug prices. The world’s biggest maker of diabetes drugs said on Wednesday it had used a so-called priority review voucher to speed up the anticipated review time of the drug to six months. The tablet belongs to a blockbuster class of treatments known as GLP-1s that stimulate insulin production.So far, all have been via injection and a pill would make it quicker and easier for diabetics to take their medication. “Many people don’t like to inject themselves with a needle,” Novo’s chief scientific officer Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen told Reuters. He said having to inject the drug also tended to make people feel more sick and others to consider them as more sick. He declined to comment on the pricing of the tablet due to competitive reasons. The semaglutide molecule is the backbone of Novo’s future growth hopes amid intensifying pricing pressure in its traditional insulin business. “Semaglutide is a spearhead into a number of new disease areas,” Thomsen said. Novo is already selling an injectable once-weekly version of semagalutide under the brand name Ozempic and is further testing the molecule in obesity, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, known as fatty liver, as well as cardiovascular and chronic kidney diseases."

2.62175730544695," Novo Nordisk CEO backs ending drug industry rebate system COPENHAGEN, Feb 1 (Reuters) - The chief executive of drugmaker Novo Nordisk on Friday welcomed a proposal calling for an end to the industry practice of offering after-market discounts called rebates to pharmacy benefit managers. “We applaud the proposal. It’s not perfectly clear yet exactly how it could be implemented,” CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen told journalists following the release of the company’s fourth-quarter results."
2.62175730544695," Novo Nordisk's new diabetes drug, outlook lift shares COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Novo Nordisk reported solid growth for its new diabetes drug on Friday and said it would submit a tablet version, a key growth hope, for U.S. approval in the first quarter, lifting the Danish drugmaker’s shares. Shares in Novo rose almost 4 percent, boosted by a revised 2019 outlook and forecast-beating sales of its new once-weekly Ozempic GLP-1 drug. The world’s top maker of diabetes drugs expects 2019 sales growth of 2-5 percent and operating profit growth of 2-6 percent, both measured in local currency. Novo faces pressure on prices from competitors and lawmakers in the United States and is pinning its growth hopes on a once-weekly injection and tablet version of its GLP-1 drug semaglutide for diabetes, as well as anti-obesity treatments. A potential “hard Brexit”, with Britain leaving the European Union without a deal, represents another political headache for Novo, which said it had more than doubled inventories to around 16 weeks and also ensured cool flight transportation to ensure a supply of insulin for British diabetics. Fourth-quarter operating profit came in below forecasts, but the miss was partly due to Novo’s acquisition of a priority review voucher for oral semaglutide, Jefferies analysts said. Novo said it would use the so-called priority review voucher when submitting its oral semaglutide drug for U.S. approval around the end of this quarter to speed up the process. The potential launch of its GLP-1 semaglutide drug as a pill is seen as a major trigger as it overcomes the aversion many diabetics have to injections. “Now we expect to shorten the review time with the FDA which means that the time we can start making contracts in the U.S. has also advanced,” Chief Executive Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen told journalists, adding that he expected the review time to be shortened to around six months. The U.S. FDA grants priority review to drugs that seem likely to provide significant improvements in safety or effectiveness or prevention of a serious condition. Jorgensen declined to comment on the pricing of the tablet, citing competitive reasons. High prescription drug costs have consistently polled as a top voter concern and have been a top priority of the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump.

10.85519454905492," Upbeat sales lift Novo Nordisk as drugmaker weathers U.S. pricing pressure COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Novo Nordisk NOVOb.CO, the world's top maker of diabetes drugs, reported encouraging sales of its main growth drivers on Thursday as it announced more job cuts amid a restructuring to cope with intensifying pricing pressure in the United States. Sales of Novo's new once-weekly Ozempic GLP-1 drug, which the Danish company hopes will take market share from Eli Lilly's LLY.N Trulicity, beat forecasts for the third quarter. Eli Lilly has been eating into Novo’s previously fast-selling Victoza - a so-called GLP-1 drug that imitates an intestinal hormone to stimulate insulin production. However, sales of Victoza, totaling 6.1 billion crowns in July-September, also beat analysts’ expectations, of 5.9 billion crowns. Novo is counting on the GLP-1 franchise as its insulin drugs face price pressure and competition from biosimilar drugs, and its shares rose 2.6 percent in early trading on what Jefferies analysts called “a strong GLP-1 performance”. Novo’s heyday of booming sales is over and in the past years it has seen slower growth mainly due to intense competition in the United States, which accounts for about half of group sales. The company had already announced a restructuring of its research and development unit and around 650 job cuts, but said on Thursday that it would reduce its workforce by 1,300 in total by the end of 2018. Most of those cuts have been made already, ti said. U.S. President Donald Trump has made lowering the cost of prescription drugs an issue for his administration and Novo Nordisk said that new U.S. legislation to rein in high drug prices will cut its 2019 sales by 1-2 percent. “This is part of preparing for that but it is as much about investing in the business, so we don’t have any plans about doing any new measures for 2019,” Chief Executive Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen told journalists on Thursday, referring to the job cuts. Novo narrowed its 2018 sales growth forecast to 4-5 percent from previously 3-5 percent but kept its operating profit growth outlook at 2-5 percent, both measured in local currencies. While investors reacted favorably to Ozempic’s sales figures so far, competition in the GLP-1 field is set to heat up. Several brokerages last month lowered Ozempic sales forecasts to account for possible competitive pressure from Lilly’s GIP/GLP-1 drug, after Novo’s rival presented strong data. Novo said it had expanded its share buyback program by 1 billion crowns to 15 billion crowns and free cash flow this year is now seen at 29-33 billion crowns from a previous guidance of 27-32 billion crowns.

11.583925754442623," Novo Nordisk hires AstraZeneca executive to revive struggling biopharma unit COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Novo Nordisk NOVOb.CO is in advanced talks to acquire assets to bolster its struggling biopharma business, its chief executive said on Monday after the drugmaker announced it had hired an AstraZeneca executive to head the unit. Novo, best known for its diabetes drugs, has been looking for biopharma assets after losing out to French rival Sanofi SASY.PA in the chase for Belgian biotech company Ablynx ABLX.BR in January. Sales at Novo's biopharma unit fell 16 percent last year and the Danish drugmaker said on Monday it has hired AstraZeneca's AZN.L head of cardiovascular and metabolic diseases, Ludovic Helfgott, to head the business from next April. Novo hopes to close the deal to buy biopharma assets this year, CEO Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen told Reuters, but declined to provide more detail on the potential deal. “It is not always easy to predict when a transaction goes through, but we are in enough ongoing discussions that it might be possible this year if all goes well,” Jorgensen said in a phone interview. Novo has previously said it was looking for biopharma deals and has earlier this year secured the global license for U.S. biotech company EpiDestiny’s sickle cell disease (SCD) program. Novo's biopharmaceutical business comprises its human growth hormone as well as its hemophilia franchises, which are facing tough competition from Roche's ROG.S Hemlibra drug. “It will take some years to get back to organic growth, so we are looking at accelerating this by buying up,” Jorgensen said, adding that the firm was also looking to make acquisitions outside hemophilia and growth disorders. Jorgensen said Novo had been “very close” to securing another biopharma deal but it fell through as the Danish company had not been convinced of the quality, without giving details about the deal. “We are not desperate, we are disciplined,” he said. He acknowledged that Novo’s biopharma unit faced commercial challenges in the short term but said it was looking to grow organically by launching its existing products in more markets including China and developing the drugs it has in its pipeline. Helfgott will replace Jesper Brandgaard, who will retire in April next year after 20 years at the Danish company. Brandgaard was also Novo CFO until he stepped down from that role earlier this year."

9.431354589568725," Lilly's diabetes drug data impresses, hurts rival Novo's shares (Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co LLY.N said on Thursday its new two-in-one diabetes drug was successful in lowering blood sugar and reducing weight, sending its shares to a record high and weighing on those of arch-rival Novo Nordisk NOVOb.CO. The novel drug targets two key gut hormones at the same time, and could pose a threat to currently available single-hormone drugs, which form a large and growing part of Novo’s business. Lilly’s treatment reduced blood sugar levels in type 2 diabetes patients by up to 2.4 percent and produced an average weight reduction of up to 12.7 percent in a mid-stage study by targeting the GLP-1 and GIP hormones. The trial results set a new industry gold standard versus marketed GLP-1s, including Novo’s Ozempic for both blood sugar lowering and weight loss, Citi analyst Andrew Baum said. Lilly’s shares were rose 6.5 percent to a record high of $115.68 in early trading, while those of Novo fell nearly 8 percent. Novo’s existing GLP-1 products include Victoza and Omzepic, and the company is also developing an oral version of semaglutide, the active ingredient in Ozempic. Lilly said it intends to complete its late-stage study for the drug in late 2021, and is also evaluating the drug for treating obesity, among other conditions. BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei said the treatment provides Lilly with a reasonable shot at the large obesity market and should meaningfully strengthen the company’s position in the rapidly growing GLP-1 market. About 30 million adults in the United States have diabetes, with 90 percent to 95 percent of them suffering from type 2 diabetes. Obesity is a major risk factor for developing type 2 diabetes, and weight loss as little as 5 percent of the total body weight has been found to help improve type 2 diabetes in patients who are obese or overweight, according to American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery. Lilly’s wide portfolio of diabetes drugs, including GLP-1 drug Trulicity, contributed at least 38 percent to its total sales of $6.36 billion in the latest reported quarter. “With Trulicity representing a core growth driver for Lilly and competitive concerns regarding Ozempic and oral semaglutide causing an overhang on shares over the past year, we see today’s results as a clear positive for the Lilly story,” JP Morgan analyst Chris Schott said in a note."

The firm, which employs more than 42,000 people in 79 countries, has seen growth slow due to pricing pressures in the United States, from where it sources about half its revenue. “This is not a cost-cutting exercise,” Novo’s chief science officer Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen said in an interview, noting that his research and development budget will be larger in 2019 than this year. “Our analysis shows that we have a surplus of manual labor and are lacking competences in the digital sphere, informatics, data science, artificial intelligence and automations.” The company plans to increase investment in innovation within both its core therapy areas and new ones.

The world’s top maker of diabetes drugs has entered a period of slower growth partly due to pricing pressure on the U.S. market, which accounts for about half of Novo’s total sales. U.S. President Donald Trump has made lowering the cost of prescription drugs an issue for his administration and on Tuesday said he would make an announcement next week on reducing prices. Some drugmakers such as Pfizer Inc and Switzerland’s Novartis have said they would not follow through on planned increases in drug prices. Novo Nordisk has no plans to follow suit and reverse list price increases announced in July, chief executive Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen told reporters, adding: “Neither do we have plans to raise the prices for the rest of the year”. The company said that subject to the final outcome of negotiations with organisations who administer drug programmes for employers and health plans, accounting for the bulk of U.S. drug sales, “average prices after rebates are expected to be lower compared with the levels in 2018”. Drug manufacturers also face new U.S. legislation next year aimed at reining in high drug prices. Novo Nordisk has said that the new rules would cut its 2019 sales by 1-2 percent. Jorgensen quashed media reports that Novo is considering laying off up to 3,000 in response to the new legislation. He said Novo was adapting its business on an ongoing basis but declined to provide further details on how it would mitigate the effects from price pressure and new regulation. Its shares were down 4.5 percent at 0939 GMT, underperforming a flat pan-European STOXX 600, with analysts citing disappointing sales of its Tresiba, Victoza and Ozempic diabetes drugs. Sales of its best-selling Victoza drug came in at 11.7 billion Danish crowns ($1.82 billion) in the first six months, undershooting the 12.2 billion expected by analysts. Total group sales in the second quarter came in at 27.4 billion crowns, below market expectations for 27.7 billion. Quarterly operating profit was 12.2 billion Danish crowns, slightly below an average 12.3 billion crowns forecast in a Reuters poll of analysts. Novo kept its 2018 outlook for sales growth of 3-5 percent and operating profit growth of 2-5 percent, both measured in local currencies.

3.7295692619168217," Novo's pioneering diabetes pill beats Victoza, Januvia in tests COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Novo Nordisk’s experimental diabetes pill, which it hopes will transform the diabetes market, has proved superior to both Merck & Co’s Januvia and its own best-selling injectable treatment Victoza in tests. The positive results in the latest of a series of pivotal clinical trials boost analysts’ expectations that Novo’s oral semaglutide medicine could become a multibillion-dollar blockbuster. Novo shares jumped more than 4 percent in early trade on Thursday. The trial against Victoza, a once-daily injection, met the primary endpoint of similar blood sugar reduction but was also superior on weight loss, Novo said in a statement late on Wednesday. “This data is important, as it positions oral-sema as at least as good as the market leading injectable GLP-1,” said Deutsche Bank analysts. The once-daily pill belongs to a blockbuster class of treatments known as GLP-1s that stimulate insulin production, the first of which were derived from the venomous bite of North America’s Gila monster lizard. So far, all have been injections. Deutsche believes oral semaglutide could eventually sell more than $5 billion a year and allow Novo to grow sales in the high-margin GLP-1 diabetes segment for years to come, with the new product potentially priced closer to expensive injections than cheaper diabetes pills. Analysts from Bernstein also said the outcome was stronger than anticipated. The outcome of the trial against Merck’s Januvia, an oral medication known chemically as sitagliptin, showed Novo’s new drug was superior in demonstrating reductions in both long-term blood sugar level and weight, Novo said. The success of oral semaglutide in the Phase III trials is a fillip for a medicine seen as important for ensuring the group’s long-term growth in a highly competitive diabetes market. It follows earlier results from other Phase III studies that have also been positive."

Drug manufacturers face new U.S. legislation aimed at reining in high drug prices. Denmark’s Novo Nordisk said in May that the new rules would cut its 2019 sales by 1-2 percent but kept its long-term operating growth forecast of 5 percent.

It announced 1,000 job cuts in 2016 as competition among insulin producers increased and prices were squeezed by pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) who administer drug programs for employers and health plans.

5.297670754296872," Novo Nordisk's oral diabetes drug beats Jardiance in study LONDON/COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Novo Nordisk said data from a large final-stage study of a pill it hopes will transform the diabetes market proved better at lowering blood sugar levels than Eli Lilly and Boehringer Ingelheim’s established Jardiance. The success of the oral form of the drug, known generically as semaglutide, in the Phase III trial is a boost for a medicine seen as important for ensuring the group’s long-term growth in a highly competitive diabetes market. While the overall positive result announced late on Tuesday was largely as expected, some investors focused on the fact that the difference in weight loss after 26 weeks between oral semaglutide and Jardiance was not statistically significant. Novo Nordisk’s shares, which are down about 16 percent from a January peak, traded around 1.2 percent lower in early dealings on Wednesday, underperforming the broader European stock market. Still, analysts at Deutsche Bank said they remained upbeat for the product. “Oral semaglutide increasingly appears to be on its way to become a major blockbuster,” they wrote in a note. “We believe this news should come as expected to most investors, a relief to some and a source of controversy to a few.” The once-daily pill, which Novo hopes to launch in 2020, belongs to a blockbuster class of treatments known as GLP-1s that stimulate insulin production. So far, all have been injections and a pill would offer a step-change in convenience. Novo said the trial achieved its primary objective “by demonstrating a statistically significant and superior improvement” in glycated hemoglobin, an indicator of blood glucose levels, with oral semaglutide compared to Jardiance. Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, Novo’s chief science officer, said the positive results from the so-called PIONEER 2 trial were “an important milestone” in the clinical development of oral semaglutide. Novo expects to provide data from the remaining eight trials this year and expects to submit the drug for regulatory approval in 2019, ahead of the drug’s potential 2020 launch."

1.4486868407108195," Novo Nordisk upbeat on new diabetes drug as profit tops forecast COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Novo Nordisk NOVOb.CO, the world's biggest maker of diabetes drugs, reported a smaller than expected fall in first-quarter profit and nudged up its full-year forecast as sales of new medicines helped to soften the hit from a weaker U.S. dollar. With its traditional insulin treatments facing price pressures in the United States, Novo is pinning its hopes on new obesity medicines and Ozempic, a once-weekly injection for diabetes expected to become its biggest drug. The initial feedback for Ozempic, known generically as semaglutide, is positive, the Danish company said. Analysts predict it will account for around 20 percent of sales in 2025. “I think the most important matter is that we have had quite some success in landing contracts with the payers,” said Chief Executive Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen. Sales of Ozempic are seen reaching at least 1 billion Danish crowns this year, he said. In the first quarter, sales were 69 million crowns, following its February launch in the United States, the world’s biggest drugs market. Ozempic belongs to a class of treatments known as GLP-1s that stimulate insulin production, the first of which was derived from the venomous bite of North America’s Gila monster lizard. So far, all have been injections, but Novo is also working on a tablet version. Novo hopes Ozempic will take market share from Eli Lilly's LLY.N one-weekly Trulicity, which has cut into sales of Novo's current top-selling drug, once-daily Victoza. At 0940 GMT, Novo shares were up 5 percent at 309.1 crowns. Morgan Stanley analysts described the results and guidance upgrade as “reassuring in the context of U.S. pricing pressure and competitive intensity in the GLP-1 market”. First-quarter operating profit fell 8 percent to 12.4 billion crowns ($2 billion), hit by the depreciation of the dollar, but beat analysts’ average forecast of 11.8 billion crowns in a Reuters poll. Novo expects 2018 sales growth of 3-5 percent compared with 2-5 percent previously and operating profit growth of 2-5 percent from 1-5 percent, both in local currencies. As well as competition in the United States, Novo faces new legislation there aimed at reining in high drug prices. The company forecast that would take 1-2 percent off its 2019 sales. The recently-passed legislation requires drug firms to cover 70 percent of the funding gap for patients under the Medicare here Part D insurance from 2019, up from around 50 percent now. High drug prices have been a hot political topic and U.S. President Donald Trump said in January pharmaceutical companies were “getting away with murder”. “We are far from having solved the affordability problem from patients in the U.S. so I still think there will be policy considerations going on,” Jorgensen said.
