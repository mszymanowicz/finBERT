26.114914732577482," Barclays resumes dividend as annual profit halves LONDON (Reuters) - Barclays has resumed modest shareholder payouts after a year-long hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic, setting expectations other British lenders will follow suit when they report 2020 earnings in the next few days. The resumption came as Barclays’ profit fell by half, much less than forecast as a strong performance by its investment bank offset provisions against bad loans from the economic fallout of the COVID-19 pandemic. Barclays shares, however, fell as much as 5%, after the payout plans and a vague outlook set out with no profit targets left investors underwhelmed. The bank said its returns are likely to improve ‘meaningfully’, without giving any numbers, and said pressure on income at its loss-making consumer business was likely to continue over the medium term. The investment bank outperformance is also unlikely to last, analysts warned, with further pain ahead as government stimulus packages for households and businesses are phased out. “Overall a good set of numbers, but the focus is likely to be on the 2021 outlook statement which is very light on detail and so could lead to some disappointment,” analysts at Citigroup said. “There are some worrying signs in Barclays’ retail arm, which has been battered by lower margins and the fact that people have been taking on less credit and paying down debts during coronavirus,” said Adam Vetesse, analyst at investment platform eToro. Barclays reported a profit before tax for 2020 of 3.1 billion pounds ($4.29 billion), well above an average of analyst forecasts of 1.96 billion pounds. Barclays’ investment bank had a stellar year, which in common with U.S. peers reported strong revenues from its equities and fixed income businesses as customers traded frantically in volatile markets in 2020. The fixed income, currencies and commodities unit reported a 53% increase in income, as swings in global interest rates and prices of commodities such as oil drove trading. Equities saw a 31% rise in income while banking fees rose by 8%. That performance drove the bank’s bonus pool up 6% for the year, although CEO Jes Staley’s pay fell from 5.9 million to 4 million pounds as the bank failed to hit its overall profit goal for the year. Wall Street banks such as Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley also saw fourth-quarter profits sail past analysts’ estimates, as coronavirus-induced volatility coupled with the impact of the U.S. elections boosted trading. Barclays’ European rival Credit Suisse meanwhile reported a comparatively weaker performance from its investment bank on Thursday. Barclays saw impairments from bad loan provisions related to the pandemic dip to 492 million pounds in the fourth quarter, giving a full year total of 4.8 billion pounds. The lender’s consumer, cards and payments division reported a loss for the year of 1.1 billion pounds, mainly due to pandemic-linked provisions. Barclays said on Thursday it would pay a full-year dividend of 1 pence per share and buy back 700 million pounds ($969.4 million) worth of stock, a vote of confidence in its balance sheet after regulators in December gave the green light for payouts. The decision by Barclays to resume payouts will raise expectations that its peers will follow suit when they report earnings in the coming days. Natwest is due to report on Friday, while HSBC, Lloyds Banking Group and Standard Chartered follow next week. The Bank of England (BoE) had told Britain’s seven biggest lenders in March to suspend dividends and share buy-backs until the end of 2020, to help them maintain capital buffers against the expected hit to their loan books from the pandemic. The BoE said in December that banks looked strong enough to resume payouts, albeit within temporary caps. Barclays gave no update on a probe by Britain’s financial regulators into links between Staley and U.S. financier Jeffrey Epstein, who killed himself while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges. Staley said at the time he regretted his links to Epstein, which began in 2000 while he was employed by JPMorgan. ($1 = 0.7221 pounds)"

23.272663723072466," Britain must focus on Asia and U.S. not EU post-Brexit, Barclays boss says LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s financial services industry should focus on winning business in the United States and Asia rather than the European Union in the aftermath of Brexit, Barclays CEO Jes Staley said. While still the only global financial centre to rival New York, the City of London has seen some business and job losses since Britain’s shock 2016 Brexit vote and has been largely cut off from the EU, its biggest single customer, by the divorce. However, some see the distancing of London from Europe as an opportunity for it to carve out a more dynamic global role. “Brexit is more than likely on the positive side than on the negative side,” Barclays CEO Staley told the BBC. “What London needs to be focused on is not Frankfurt or Paris, [it] needs to be focused on New York and Singapore,” Staley, an American banker who spent 30 years in senior roles at U.S. financial services giant JPMorgan, added. New York retained the top spot in a survey of global financial centres published in September by Global Financial Centres Index, with London strengthening its position in second. While trading in euro shares and some derivatives has left for other European centres, including some to New York, since Brexit, no one European competitor has emerged as a dominant force in the EU and so London views New York, Shanghai, Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore as its true rivals. London dominates the world’s $6.6 trillion-a-day foreign exchange market, is the biggest centre for international banking and the second largest fintech hub after the United States. “What the UK needs and London needs, is to make sure that the City is one of the best places, whether [it is in terms of] regulation or law or language, or talent,” Staley said. Echoing other leading City of London figures, he cautioned, however, against a bonfire of regulation. “I wouldn’t burn one piece of regulation,” added the boss of Barclays, which he said employs some 50,000 people in the United Kingdom, roughly 20,000 outside of the UK and 10,000 in the U.S. “Some amount of capital has moved but London is still obviously the main centre for Barclays....there are some jobs that are going to Europe, that otherwise would have been in the UK, but it’s in the hundreds,” Staley added."

The blue-chip FTSE 100 index rose 0.8%, with financial stocks, mainly HSBC Holdings and Barclays PLC leading the gains. The mid-cap index added 1.5%. BP fell 4.5% to the bottom of the FTSE 100 as its profit in the last quarter of 2020 sunk to $115 million on weak energy demand. “Supporting a more positive mood was an apparent calming of the Reddit-inspired frenzy on markets as well as hopes for a vaccine-led exit from lockdown,” said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. “In the short term a lot of attention will be across the Atlantic with more big U.S. corporate names reporting and continuing focus on the progress of new President Joe Biden’s coronavirus relief package.” Britain began door-to-door testing to curb the spread of a highly-infectious variant of the novel coronavirus, while the country’s house prices fell for the first time in seven months in January, mortgage lender Nationwide said. Global stock markets gained for a second day, ahead of negotiations between U.S. President Joe Biden and Republican senators on a new COVID-19 support bill. The FTSE 100 has recovered nearly 30% from its March 2020 lows and is 15% away from its highest point last year, led by stimulus support and re-opening optimism, but a surge in infections and lockdowns have slowed growth.

36.20373325299649," Working from home is losing its effectiveness, bank execs say (Reuters) - Working from home has been surprisingly successful for global banks during the first year of the coronavirus pandemic but is losing its effectiveness, two prominent industry executives said on Tuesday at a virtual meeting of the World Economic Forum. “It’s remarkable it’s working as well as it is, but I don’t think it’s sustainable,” said Barclays Chief Executive Jes Staley. Mary Erdoes, who runs asset and wealth management for JPMorgan Chase & Co, added, “It is fraying. It is hard.” For employees to focus, Erodes said: “It takes a lot of inner strength and sustainability (without) the energy that you get from being around other people.” Staley said: “It will increasingly be a challenge to maintain the culture and collaboration that these large financial institutions seek to have and should have.” He predicted that more people would come back to offices to work, but with flexibility to work from home. Erdoes said executives believed that part of the initial success of working from home was due to adrenalin from having to adapt so quickly. Now, she said, executives were facing the likelihood that COVID-19 and its variants would persist for a long time. “The world is going to have to figure out how to adapt,” Erdoes said. Staley also told the event - which is being held virtually this year, rather than in the Swiss ski resort of Davos, due to the coronavirus - that the world economy could experience a boom after the pandemic similar to the “Roaring 20s” that followed the 1918 flu pandemic. Pent-up demand was widespread and could power growth, he said. “You could have a robust second half to the year,” Staley said, followed by an “explosion of demand”."

Yellen, the former Federal Reserve chair, disclosed the more than 50 speaking gigs, including to government-regulated Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Barclays Plc and hedge fund Citadel LLC, as part of a set of documents that move her candidacy closer to consideration by the U.S. Senate. In another filing to the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, Yellen said she would seek written authorizations to participate in substantive issues involving such firms. Yellen agreed to resign from her position as a consultant for Australian investment firm Magellan Financial Group Ltd if she is confirmed by the Senate. She also outlined several divestments in public company stock that she would implement if she is confirmed. The Treasury Department has broad regulatory powers over financial companies. High-profile former government officials like Yellen, who was appointed as Fed chair by Democratic President Barack Obama and served in the role until 2018, often take paid speaking jobs after their retirement from public service. President Donald Trump’s Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, a former Goldman Sachs executive and Hollywood film financier, pledged to divest at least $94 million worth of investments in 43 entities to avoid conflicts of interest when he was appointed to Trump’s Cabinet. In his confirmation hearings, Mnuchin was attacked for failing to promptly disclose that he was a director of an offshore business vehicle domiciled in the Cayman Islands and owned more than $100 million in real estate. Senator Ron Wyden, the senior Democrat on the committee that will evaluate Yellen, said she has shared views in a range of forums, from media interviews to speaking engagements, and has been fully transparent. “Secretary-designate Yellen is one of the world’s top economic minds, and her perspective on economic matters has been widely sought after since she left the Federal Reserve,” Wyden said."

19.759672704889507," Barclays keeps 2021 oil price outlook, supported by vaccine boost (Reuters) - Barclays kept its “above consensus” 2021 oil price forecasts on Monday, predicting Brent at $53 a barrel based on output discipline by OPEC and its allies, and based on a potential COVID-19 vaccine boosting demand in the second half. Potential rollouts of high-efficacy vaccines in the short term would be a turning point for demand as it could lead to a more sustainable economic recovery, the bank said in a note. It forecast Brent at an average $53 a barrel and U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude at $50 per barrel in 2021. Sources have told Reuters that the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, Russia and its allies, known as OPEC+, are leaning towards postponing of a planned January increase to oil output by at least three months. OPEC+ was due to raise output by 2 million barrels per day in January as part of a steady easing of record supply cuts agreed this year. “We expect the OPEC+ group to delay the ratcheting up of production targets by three months when the group meets later this month,” the bank said. Goldman Sachs also said this month that it expected the group to delay their planned output increase.

16.326537595273365," India's economy to return to normal faster than expected: Barclays BENGALURU (Reuters) - Barclays lifted its fiscal 2022 growth forecast for the Indian economy to 8.5% from an earlier projection of 7%, saying the country would “return to normal” faster than expected as the COVID-19 curve in the world’s second-most populous nation starts flattening. India is nearing 9 million confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus – the second highest in the world, after the United States – but the number of new daily cases has fallen since a peak in mid-September. “The prospect of an effective vaccine in the near future and high seroprevalence of antibodies across the population support the case for a more durable economic recovery,” Barclays said in a note. Businesses have opened up and economic activity has picked up in India after one of the world’s strictest lockdowns were eased, with companies like motorcycle maker Hero MotoCorp and jewellery maker Titan Company reporting strong sales during the festive season. The brokerage, however, revised down its GDP forecast for the current fiscal year to negative 6.4% from negative 6%. It expects GDP to fall by 8.5% in the second quarter of the current fiscal year, almost in line with the Indian central bank’s forecast. Last week, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) projected GDP to contract by 8.6% in the July-September quarter, implying the country was likely to have entered a technical recession in the first half of the year for the first time in its history. Barclays said on Thursday it expects growth in GDP will resume in the third quarter of the current financial year, a quarter earlier than the RBI’s projection. Last month, a Reuters poll showed the Indian economy would rebound by 9.0% in fiscal 2022, after suffering its deepest contraction on record this fiscal year."

33.96227196459519," Barclays beats profit forecasts as CEO Staley aims to stay on LONDON (Reuters) - Barclays on Friday reported stronger than expected third-quarter results thanks to a return to profit for the bank’s consumer businesses and Chief Executive Jes Staley said he aimed to stay on for two more years. There has been speculation over Staley’s future since Barclays disclosed in February that British regulators had launched an investigation into Staley’s past connections to the late financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, which is yet to conclude. British media reports around the same time said the bank’s board had appointed a headhunter to search for a successor and that Staley himself had indicated internally that he would leave by 2021. Staley, who was appointed CEO in 2015, has said he regrets having had any relationship with Epstein. “I think we’ll be here for another couple of years,” Staley told reporters on a conference call on Friday. Barclays is the first major British bank to publish third- quarter earnings and analysts and investors are watching results for any signs of an expected wave of bad loans due to the fallout from COVID-19 pandemic. Barclays reported profit before tax of 1.1 billion pounds ($1.4 billion) for the three months to the end of September, almost double the 507 million pounds analysts had forecast. The bank’s shares jumped following its results and were up nearly 7% at 0855 GMT, the strongest performer in the benchmark FTSE 100 index. “While these results aren’t exactly pretty, they’re far less ugly than we had feared they might be,” Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said. The bank booked 608 million pounds in provisions for bad loans and other charges, down 63% from the previous quarter and well below the 1 billion pounds analysts had expected. However, Barclays said it was considering further cost-cutting measures, which could result in more charges. Staley said these could include reductions in office space and other such overheads as the bank learns lessons from employees’ ability to work from home or at branches during the coronavirus pandemic. The bank’s consumer, cards and payments business made a profit of 165 million pounds in the quarter after a loss in the second quarter as U.S. credit card spending recovered. The stronger-than-expected results boosted the bank’s core capital ratio, a key measure of its financial strength, to 14.6%, which was also above forecasts for 14%. The lender’s investment bank supported its results, as it has done in recent quarters, in a fillip for Staley who has staked much of his credibility on the business at a time when some shareholders want it cut back. Revenue from its markets division, which has benefited from frenzied trading amid volatile markets worldwide, rose 29% from a year earlier to 1.69 billion pounds. Equities trading jumped 40% to 691 million pounds while fixed income, currencies and commodities rose 23% to 1 billion pounds. Like its rivals, Barclays has halted dividend payments at the request of Britain’s regulators. It said it would give an update on its payout policy when it reports full-year results. Barclays downgraded its baseline economic forecast for the United Kingdom this year as local lockdowns kick in to control a second wave of COVID-19 heading into the winter months. The bank now expects gross domestic product to fall 10.3% this year, versus its June forecast of an 8.7% drop, but it said there had been no significant rise in bad loans so far due to government financial support for jobs and companies. U.S. banks, which reported earnings earlier this month, gave a muddied picture of what to expect, with balance sheets looking healthier than expected but executives forecasting a gloomy outlook for losses from loans.

Breaking a four-day losing streak, the pan-European STOXX 600 index .STOXX advanced 0.6%, with London's FTSE 100 .FTSE outperforming its European peers after Barclays BARC.L jumped 7% on strong results.[.L] That lifted regional banks .SX7P, putting them on course for their best monthly performance in over a year. Other sectors considered more economically sensitive such as automakers .SXAP and oil & gas .SXEP also found favour. “Better than expected results from Barclays triggered renewed interest in banking shares, most of which are trading on depressed levels so value investors will be particularly interested,” said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. Meanwhile, data on Friday showed euro zone economic activity fell this month, while the German manufacturing sector expanded at a faster rate in October. But the German services activity shrank, suggesting Europe’s largest economy is operating at two speeds. “Opposite forces are in play at the moment,” said Emmanuel Cau, head of European equity strategy at Barclays. “Globally you’ve these two main sources of growth - U.S. and China - that are still recovering, so part of the European market will still benefit from the strength outside of Europe.” “But the domestic part of the market exposed to mobility and restrictions are impacted by the second wave.” Surging COVID-19 cases in the region have led to more curbs of late, with France looking set to widen a curfew to more than two thirds of its population. Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said GDP will likely contract in the fourth quarter, adding that curfew measures would cost around two billion euros ($2.36 billion). With some optimism this week stemming from new fiscal stimulus in the UK, markets now look to the European Central Bank meeting next week when analysts expect the bank to signal policy support in December. Globally, the mood was one of caution with less than two weeks to go before the U.S. presidential election.

33.96227196459519," Breakingviews - Jes Staley’s Barclays strategy will go stale LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Barclays Chief Executive Jes Staley’s decision to keep a big investment bank has been a blessing in 2020. But that’s been the exception rather than the rule during his tenure. As the board plans for Staley’s eventual exit, a candidate who is less attached to the markets business would be the best choice. True, having a large trading unit allows banks to better weather economic downturns. When loans sour, frenetic capital markets provide income. Barclays’ investment bank generated a 10.5% annualised return on tangible equity (ROTE) in the first nine months of 2020 after excluding litigation and conduct charges compared with 3.8% for the group, results showed on Friday. And Barclays’ shares are down 39% this year, less than the average 51% fall for retail-focused Lloyds Banking and NatWest. The surging investment bank may, however, already be running out of steam. Revenue in the three months to Sept. 30 was 16% below the average of the two previous quarters. The VIX Index and ICE BofA MOVE Index, which measure expected volatility in the U.S. equity and Treasury markets, are down 32% and 11% respectively in the past six months. Nor do a few good quarters for investment banking compensate for consistently sub-par returns. The unit’s annualised ROTE has only surpassed 10%, its probable cost of equity, in three of the past 19 quarters. The average annualised quarterly ROTE over that period is 6.7%, meaning it destroyed value. That explains why Barclays still trades at a discount to Lloyds and NatWest, and recently even Deutsche Bank, which is shrinking its wholesale unit. The lesson is that investors don’t prize diversification - especially if it comes with low and volatile returns. Staley said on Friday he would like to run Barclays for two more years. But the board will already be thinking about succession planning. The company in September effectively anointed Paul Compton and CS Venkatakrishnan as the internal candidates, giving them each one half of the investment bank to run. Like Staley, they previously worked at JPMorgan. The risk for shareholders is that, if elevated to the top spot, they would be reluctant to cut or reallocate capital away from their former fiefdom. An outsider, on the other hand, might be better-placed to shake things up - and rid Barclays of its bargain-basement valuation."

Staveley is claiming hundreds of millions of pounds in damages from Barclays in a civil case that kicked off in June and hinges on how the bank secured emergency funds from Qatar and Abu Dhabi and averted a state bailout in October 2008. Staveley’s PCP Capital Partners, which led a 3.25 billion pound ($4.2 billion), Abu Dhabi-backed investment, alleges it was induced to fund Barclays on much worse terms than Qatar -- despite assurances it would get the same deal. PCP, which reduced its maximum damages claim to 836 million pounds from 1.5 billion during the trial, alleges Barclays paid Qatar 346 million pounds in secret fees and handed the Gulf state a $3 billion loan that almost matched Qatar’s investment. Qatar said after the February fraud trial that two additional services agreements with Barclays, agreed in June and October 2008, were genuine. Had PCP been aware of these “very sweet” terms, it would have sought a better deal, it alleged. The case turned the spotlight back on Barclays’ arrangements with Qatar four months after three senior bank executives were acquitted of fraud in a criminal case over advisory service agreements it struck with the Gulf nation in 2008. Barclays alleged it had struck separate, commercial agreements with Qatar and that PCP’s case was “wrong at every stage”. Testifying during the trial, Barclays’ former top rainmaker Roger Jenkins accepted he might have used the words “same deal” to Staveley, but said he would have intended to refer to Qatar subscribing for the same instruments. After a dispute about whether PCP was a potential investor or merely an advisor to Abu Dhabi, Barclays noted Staveley may have hoped to participate as a principal -- but alleged she did not suffer a loss due to Barclays’ actions. The bank said PCP was paid a “handsome” 30 million pounds by Abu Dhabi and attacked Staveley as a “thoroughly unreliable witness”, who used “embellishment and invention” and whose modus operandi was to “duck and weave”. Twelve years ago, bankers used sexist and demeaning language when discussing the financier and criticised her professional competence. Apologising, one resigned as a senior bank lobbyist in June before the comments were aired. Nevertheless, the bank relied on the then 34-year-old to bring on board Abu Dhabi royal Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan to help secure its independent future. A judgment is expected later."
55.10205795648923," Barclays to enter new European private banking markets in 2021 ZURICH (Reuters) - Barclays BARC.L plans to enter four new European private banking markets in 2021, its regional manager for the business told Reuters. Gerald Mathieu, who in September became Barclays’ private banking head for Europe outside Britain, said the British bank was looking to start up the business in France, Italy, Spain and Germany next year. “These are the countries where we see a lot of opportunities, also because we have a very strong footprint of corporate and investment banking locally,” Mathieu said in an interview. “The idea is to have a capital-light approach and work in very close collaboration with the investment bank locally, targeting family offices, ultra high net worth individuals, and some qausi-corporate or institutional clients.” The bank said it was too early to disclose hiring plans. Barclays, which does not separately report revenues or profits for private banking, maintains hubs for managing wealth in Europe in Monaco, Switzerland, and Ireland. It will grow activities in new European markets via its European Union-licensed platform in Dublin, Mathieu said, working together with local corporate and investment banking teams. Previously Barclays’ country head for Switzerland, Mathieu said the bank had seen an inflow of clients into Switzerland as the market gained appeal amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Both the Swiss and broader European private banking business were seeing growth in managed assets, he said. But the COVID-19 pandemic and negative interest rates presented particular challenges to the business and industry as a whole. “The industry is facing global margin compression and very aggressive pricing competition,” he said. “The private banking business across Europe is profitable, but we have to anticipate and adapt our business model to the challenges of these times.”"

Peikin, whose intention to leave the SEC was announced last month, starts Nov. 2 as head of the firm’s new securities and commodities investigations and enforcement practice. In his previous stint at Sullivan & Cromwell, he’d led the criminal defense and investigations group and represented clients including Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Barclays PLC. “I had such a good experience there ... it just seemed like a natural fit for me,” Peikin said Wednesday. “I had the fortune when I was there to work for very sophisticated clients in the most complex and pressing and interesting matters. As a lawyer, that’s kind of what you want to do.” Sullivan & Cromwell is headquartered in New York and has more than 875 attorneys in 13 offices worldwide, according to its website. Peikin returns to the firm with an agency perspective that “you can’t really get from the outside,” he said, understanding first-hand “how decisions are made and what things matter.” He left in 2017 to join the SEC, where Jay Clayton, another ex-Sullivan & Cromwell partner, continues to serve as chairman. During Peikin’s tenure the SEC brought about 2,500 enforcement actions and ordered approximately $14 billion in financial remedies, Sullivan & Cromwell said. The SEC announced his departure on Aug. 5, shortly after the Trump administration tapped Clayton to replace Geoffrey Berman as U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, a move Peikin said had no impact on his decision. He’d always planned to depart the SEC after three years but stayed on slightly longer because of the coronavirus pandemic, he said. Before his initial stint a Sullivan & Cromwell he’d spent eight years in the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York. “We are delighted Steve will be rejoining us,” said Joseph Shenker, Sullivan & Cromwell’s chairman, in a statement on Wednesday. “Steve’s contributions to S&C in the past were very significant, and the addition of his SEC experience to his prior experience here and, prior to that, as Chief of the SDNY’s Securities and Commodities Fraud Task Force, will allow him to provide invaluable advice to our clients.”"

French lender Societe Generale SOGN.PA said it is also ""adapting its position in line with UK government guidance"", without stating the number of workers recently returned to work in its London offices who will now stay home. Two other big British lenders told Reuters they will also likely reverse recent return-to-work moves for non-essential staff.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson told people to work from home where possible and ordered bars and restaurants to close early to tackle a fast-spreading second wave of COVID-19. The latest advice comes just weeks after Johnson urged people to return to their workplaces to try to limit the economic damage to nearly-abandoned city centres. Around 22,000 Barclays staff have remained working in its offices worldwide throughout the pandemic, as designated key workers needed to keep the financial system ticking over. Of the roughly 1,000 more who had begun to return to work worldwide, hundreds based in Britain will resume working from home, the spokesman said, with others potentially following suit if local advice changes in other countries. Banks, including Barclays, had begun to return more staff to office-based working, mainly in Britain where the government had earlier encouraged people to resume their daily commutes. More lenders are also expected to tell all but essential staff to work from home, a source at another big British bank said on Tuesday, asking not to be named.

26.3440899954695," Barclays being probed by UK privacy watchdog on accusations of spying on staff (Reuters) - Barclays Plc BARC.L is being probed by the United Kingdom's privacy watchdog, the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), over allegations that the British bank spied on its staff, the agency said on Sunday. Earlier this year, Barclays said it was changing a system that the bank was piloting, which tracked how employees spent their time at work, after critical media reports accused the bank of spying on its staff. The ICO said on Sunday a formal probe was ongoing but it could not say when the investigation would conclude. “People expect that they can keep their personal lives private and that they are also entitled to a degree of privacy in the workplace,” an ICO spokesman said. “If organisations wish to monitor their employees, they should be clear about its purpose and that it brings real benefits. Organisations also need to make employees aware of the nature, extent and reasons for any monitoring”, he added. The probe was reported earlier by The Sunday Telegraph newspaper. Late in February, Barclays said it was changing how it used the Sapience software so it would now track only anonymised data, in response to staff feedback that the system was intrusive. Sapience gives companies “insights into work patterns” and tracks employee productivity by monitoring their computer usage, according to its website. Such systems are becoming increasingly common among banks and other financial firms, which use voice recognition and other behaviour-tracking tools to watch for unusual behaviour that could indicate misconduct. In 2017, Barclays faced widespread criticism when it rolled out a system known as OccupEye, which tracked how long people spent at their desks."
-1.2704132147512066," Bad debt charge overshadows trading surge at Barclays LONDON (Reuters) - Barclays BARC.L set aside a higher than expected 1.6 billion pounds ($2.1 billion) to cover a possible rise in loan losses in the second quarter and warned a grim outlook and low interest rates would hurt profits into 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced banks globally to set aside billions to cover bad loans and the British bank’s consumer business is under pressure from lower interest rates, smaller credit card balances and personal loan repayment holidays. Barclays booked pretax profit for the first half of the year of 1.3 billion pounds, down from 3 billion pounds a year ago as provisions against potential bad debts outweighed improved revenues from its investment bank. Barclays’ trading performance was a bright spot as virus-induced market volatility prompted a 60% jump in trading revenues in foreign-exchange, rates and credit trading. However, the bank’s shares were down 4.3% at 0756 GMT amid fears higher future impairments and dwindling consumer income would outweigh the investment banking revenues. “I think the market rightly sees that still as lower quality, less stable revenue,” Goodbody analysts said. The markets division posted a 49% rise in revenue to 2.1 billion pounds, an endorsement of the strategy adopted by Chief Executive Jes Staley, who has championed the investment banking business contrary to the wishes of activist shareholder Edward Bramson, who wants to shrink it. Barclays was expected to report credit impairment charges and loan loss provisions of 1.42 billion pounds for April-June, according to analysts’ average forecast compiled by the bank. The latest provision takes the half-year total to 3.7 billion pounds, and analysts expect that to rise to 5.79 billion pounds for the full year. Barclays said impairments in the second half were unlikely to reach levels seen in January-June, assuming no change in economic forecasts. It says it has been conservative in its approach to forecasting an economic recovery and provisioning against bad debts, with coverage of unsecured loans much higher than the actual default levels seen in the 2008 crisis. “If you look at our underlying credit performance at the moment it’s relatively benign, our delinquency statistics don’t feel like the headlines you are hearing,” finance director Tushar Morzaria told reporters on a conference call. The bank also said it would see short-term pressure on efforts to keep costs low, as it spends on various COVID-19 related initiatives. Elsewhere in Europe, Spain's Santander SAN.MC reported a record quarterly loss after booking a 12.6 billion euro hit in the second quarter, the largest impairment charge yet for a European bank in the pandemic. Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE, which competes with Barclays for investment banking revenues, posted a second quarter loss, but echoed Barclays' upbeat trading performance. Barclays’ capital ratio was 14.2%, up from 13.1% at the end of March, as recent regulatory changes boosted its reserves. Barclays flagged the capital boost earlier this month. However, the bank warned its capital buffer could come under pressure in the second half of the year. (GRAPHIC - Barclays shares: )"

While a recent rally has been supported by faster-than-expected rebalancing of supply and demand as countries reopen their economies, producers cut production and the U.S. dollar weakens, “we are not there yet in terms of fundamentals for the next leg higher,” analysts at the bank said in a note. Benchmark Brent crude prices LCOc1 have rebounded to around $44.50 a barrel, after plunging in April to $15.98, the lowest since 1999.

-11.16751493685762," Barclays gets capital boost ahead of potential coronavirus loan losses LONDON (Reuters) - Barclays BARC.L told investors on Monday that recent regulatory changes had boosted its core capital, giving the British bank a bigger buffer to absorb any further loan losses during the coronavirus crisis. The bank said it expected to report a CET1 capital ratio of 14% in half-year results later this month, up from 13.1% at the end of March and ahead of market expectations. Barclays also said it expected risk-weighted assets to be lower than previously anticipated. The bank said its half-year results would reflect challenging income and impairments in its consumer and corporate business, but strength in its markets income. Barclays shares were up nearly 2% at 1135 GMT following the announcement, making them the biggest gainers among FTSE 100 banks on the day. John Cronin, banking analyst at Goodbody, said it was likely other banks could see a similar boost to capital from the recent rules changes, including a softening of capital accounting rules rolled out in June. “The fresh guidance is also suggestive of lower-than-consensus impairments, which is not surprising given improved market expectations in a GDP and unemployment trough context,” Cronin added. “However, many customers are still on payment breaks and it is very early days in a loan losses context.”"
-3.986136722986746," Big economies face surging debt, have time to put house in order, Barclays says LONDON (Reuters) - Major developed economies face a surge in debt as the coronavirus crisis sparks massive fiscal stimulus, but they have time to get their houses in order, Barclays said on Wednesday. In a new report on debt in developed markets, the British bank added that policymakers won’t be able to ignore worsening fiscal profiles for long. The ratio of debt to gross domestic product for G20 countries is set to rise above World War Two levels in the coming year. Barclays expects the U.S. ratio to rise almost 30 percentage points over the next two years; the euro area’s is likely to grow to around 100% in 2020 from about 85% in 2019. Barclays said the United States is seeing the greatest fiscal deterioration but is “least likely to face a reckoning” on its debt levels. That is because the world’s biggest economy enjoys the benefits of having the reserve currency and a large and liquid bond market that’s less prone to volatility, Barclays said. But the euro zone remains vulnerable, as a monetary union without a fiscal union. Italy’s debt burden is rising sharply, but its debt trajectory is likely to stabilise at high levels rather than end up on “unsustainable exponential path”, Barclays said. It expects the country’s debt/GDP ratio to reach 165%. “The key contributor is the structurally low core interest rates and the ECB’s commitment to putting a cap on Italian spreads,” Barclays said, referring to the European Central Bank’s asset-purchase scheme. Barclays also said the bar for a new euro zone debt crisis was high versus 2010-12, noting a sharp fall in financing costs. It estimates average nominal yields on sovereign debt have fallen to below 2% from 3.75% in 2010. But while borrowing costs in the eurozone have fallen broadly, the diverging economic trends between Southern and Northern Europe and its unique monetary system means Europe has to carve out a separate way to reduce overall debt. Barclays expects redistributing money and credit and pursuing a policy of financial repression by putting a ceiling on bond yields will be the most relevant channels to reduce debt to income levels in highly indebted nations. For Italy, “an evolution of partial fiscal transfers and debt mutualisation into a permanent one over time would provide protection in case of more permanent macro shocks in the interest rate environment,” it said. In Britain, Barclays expects debt management to come under greater scrutiny in a post-Brexit environment. “A belief that the gilt market will passively accept higher borrowings and less fiscal transparency may be an assumption that a future government does not have the luxury of making,” Barclays said."

Staveley’s PCP Capital Partners alleges Barclays reneged on written and oral representations that it would get the same terms as Qatar during a 7.3 billion pound ($9.3 billion) emergency cash call in October 2008 that allowed the British bank to avoid a state bailout. The High Court battle, broadcast online, turns the spotlight back on Barclays’ arrangements with Qatar four months after three senior Barclays executives were acquitted of fraud in a case revolving around advisory service agreements (ASA) struck with Qatar in 2008. PCP alleges that Qatar had received 346 million pounds in extra fees, including a 280 million pound “sham” ASA, and a $3.0 billion loan from Barclays that almost matched the amount the Gulf state was investing. Qatar said after the February fraud trial that two ASAs with Barclays, agreed in 2008, were genuine. PCP also alleges that if it had known about the Qatar deal, it would have negotiated extra fees or revised terms and would have kept a 10% interest in the funding deal -- which it gave up to keep Abu Dhabi investors on board that November. Barclays’ lawyer Jeffery Onions told the trial on Tuesday that Staveley’s case bore little or no relationship to the facts, alleging that the ASA and loan were separate commercial agreements. Onions alleged that to suggest PCP was also an investor in its own right had been “crafted and embellished in order to justify the enormous claim”. “PCP was a middleman,” he alleged. PCP, which led a group that invested about 3.25 billion pounds in Barclays in 2008, was paid 30 million pounds in April 2009 for its work. Staveley is currently fronting another group, that includes Saudi sovereign wealth fund PIF and billionaire brothers David and Simon Reuben, that is negotiating a takeover bid for Premier League side Newcastle United."
-20.23809274311738," British financier Staveley's $2 billion Barclays lawsuit hits High Court LONDON (Reuters) - British buinesswoman Amanda Staveley's private equity firm told London's High Court on Monday it had received a ""substantially worse"" deal than Qatar when its syndicate invested billions of pounds in Barclays BARC.L during the financial crisis in 2008. Claiming damages of up to 1.5 billion pounds ($1.9 billion) for alleged deceit, a lawyer for Staveley’s PCP Capital Partners alleged Barclays had reneged on written and oral representations that PCP’s syndicate would get the same terms as Qatar. The civil case hinges on the terms Barclays offered Qatar and PCP’s syndicate, which included Abu Dhabi investors, for taking part in a 7.3 billion pound cash call in October 2008 that allowed the British bank to avoid a state bailout. Barclays has dismissed the case as misconceived. It argues that an eight-year Serious Fraud Office inquiry into whether side deals, called advisory service agreements (ASAs), struck with Qatar in 2008 had been undisclosed fees had culminated in blanket acquittals. PCP alleges Barclays paid Qatar 346 million pounds in extra fees as well as agreeing to a $3 billion loan for the Gulf nation in November 2008 that at the date of drawdown almost exactly matched the amount Qatar was investing. “In fact, the deal that the Qataris got was very substantially better and PCP’s deal very substantially worse,” lawyer Joe Smouha told the court as he opened the case for PCP. PCP, whose syndicate invested about 3.25 billion pounds in Barclays in 2008, was paid 30 million pounds in April 2009 for its work on the transaction. The high-profile trial, one of the last legal clashes in Britain to revolve around the 2008 crisis, is expected to hear nine weeks of evidence and call former Barclays CEO John Varley and one-time senior rainmaker Roger Jenkins. Staveley is due to give evidence later this week. The case has come to court four months after Jenkins and two other former Barclays executives were acquitted of fraud in the criminal case brought by the SFO over two 2008 fundraisings. Varley was acquitted last year. The defendants argued that June and October ASAs had been cleared by senior directors and lawyers and were intended to open up lucrative business opportunities in the Middle East. Qatar has said its investment in Barclays created a strategic partnership and was part of a plan to build a global financial portfolio and that the ASAs were genuine."

8.203116557522302," Barclays bosses defend climate ambitions as HQ sprayed with 'oil' LONDON (Reuters) - The Chairman of Barclays said the British bank “can and should play a leading role” in tackling climate change, hours after environmental activists sprayed imitation oil on its headquarters to call on the lender to divest from fossil fuels. Barclays also faced another broadside from rebel shareholder Sherborne Investors, which again questioned whether Chief Executive Jes Staley should remain in post given his links to disgraced U.S. financier Jeffrey Epstein. Addressing climate change concerns, Chairman Nigel Higgins said the lender was committed to becoming greener in a statement to mark the annual general meeting, which was held behind closed doors to comply with COVID-19 social distancing rules. Activists from Extinction Rebellion said biodegradable and vegan “oil” was sprayed onto Barclays’ office in Canary Wharf in London in protest at the bank’s financial support of energy businesses. A climate change motion put forward by investor group ShareAction was defeated at the AGM but won 24% of votes cast. A separate resolution on Barclays’ strengthened climate policy won 99.9% support. The ShareAction resolution had called on Barclays to set, disclose and evaluate targets to “phase out” financial services to fossil fuels, energy and utility companies. Barclays proposed the setting, disclosure and annual assessment of targets to “transition” from such lending activities and to become a net zero bank by 2050, leading some critics to say the proposal gave the bank too much latitude to finance carbon over the medium term. “Today’s voting results will send shockwaves through the banking industry,” Catherine Howarth, chief executive of ShareAction said. “While Barclays is Europe’s largest fossil fuel financier, it is far from being the only bank to prop up companies that are driving the climate crisis.” Barclays is seventh in a list of lenders to the fossil fuel industry, with nearly $120 billion lent between 2016-2019, data from U.S. pressure group Rainforest Action Network showed. Barclays declined to comment on the Extinction Rebellion protest or the Sherborne statement. Sherborne, the bank’s largest shareholder with a 5.8% stake, said last month it would defer a long-running campaign to displace Staley as the bank battled with the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic. It said it would withhold its vote to re-elect him instead. The activist investor led by Edward Bramson said the board’s unanimous endorsement of Staley did not address the central question of why Staley continued to “benefit from doing business” with Epstein long after Epstein’s crimes became public. “In our view, this behaviour, alone, would make Mr. Staley unsuitable to be a director of any financial institution,” Sherborne said. “When other shareholders’ votes become public in the coming weeks, we would be curious to know how those who voted for Mr. Staley’s reappointment arrived at a different conclusion.” Britain’s financial regulators are investigating Staley’s links to Epstein, who killed himself in August while awaiting trial in the United States on sex-trafficking charges. A significant proportion of the bank’s shareholders did not vote, with at least 30% abstaining from each resolution. Staley was re-elected with 99.6% support of the votes cast, which reflected 66% of the issued share register."

The resolution was put forward by the bank’s board in response to pressure from investors and the campaign group ShareAction which had put forward its own resolution. The Norway wealth fund holds a 2.94% stake in Barclays which was worth $1.2 billion at the end of 2019. “We expect all companies in our portfolio to be transparent about their strategy for calculating, disclosing and reducing greenhouse gas emissions in their operations and value chain,” the fund said in a statement. “The exact nature of implementation, such as the magnitude, frameworks and timelines for emissions reduction, should be determined by the board and management,” it added. Barclays will pledge to be a “net zero” emissions bank by 2050, to set a strategy for transitioning its provision of financial services to align with the goals and timelines of the Paris Agreement, and to report annually on progress. British non-governmental organisation Share Action was calling on investors to also back its own resolution to ensure the bank actually stops financing carbon emitters rather than just taking offsetting measures. Norway’s wealth fund has long been pushing for the firms it invests in to disclose non-financial data, such as greenhouse gas emissions, and to find out how resilient their businesses would be to various climate change scenarios.

-0.18116661752210747," Breakingviews - Barclays’ JPMorgan impression may fall flat LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Bank results are like optical illusions: Similar numbers can make a different impression depending on the viewer’s angle. That’s the case with Barclays and its Chief Executive Jes Staley’s erstwhile employer, JPMorgan. Both took aggressive charges for bad debt. But what looks like a sign of strength for the U.S. bank may emphasise existing worries about Barclays. The 18 billion pound lender on Wednesday unveiled a mammoth 2.1 billion pound charge for possible loan losses, equivalent to roughly 2.2% of its gross lending on an annualised basis. That’s significantly higher than a broadly equivalent charge equal to 1.2% of loans announced by HSBC, on Tuesday, as well as Deutsche Bank’s 0.44% first-quarter loan-loss rate. A big part of the gap comes down to the banks’ different businesses. About two-fifths of the bad-debt charge for Staley’s group came from its consumer, cards and payments unit, which houses the U.S. credit-card operations. Such unsecured lending is far more sensitive to an economic shock than, say, Deutsche Bank’s German mortgages, which make up 29% of its 459 billion euro loan book. But Staley’s beancounters are arguably taking a more pessimistic approach than those at Deutsche Bank. Barclays’ credit forecasts are based on a 50% likelihood of oil staying around $20 throughout the year and sharp rise in U.S. unemployment to peak at 17% and average almost 13% in 2020. By contrast the German lender’s full-year forecast for credit losses is based on average GDP and unemployment rates over the next three years, factoring in some of the benefit of a potential recovery. Deutsche Bank is availing itself of European regulators’ forbearance and looking through some of the pain. Barclays boss Staley, by contrast, has adopted an approach that resembles JPMorgan’s. The U.S. bank on April 14 said it expects a “fairly severe recession”, and took an $8.3 billion charge to absorb the resulting deterioration of loans and other assets. The JPMorgan impression may fall flat. While the American bank’s move looked like a prudent way to bolster its balance sheet, Barclays’ may instead remind investors of its heavy exposure to investment banking and risky consumer credit, a racy business mix by European standards. The UK lender trades at a lowly 0.4 times forward tangible book value, compared with 0.6 on average for the top 25 Europe-listed banks. Staley’s hair shirt may fit a little too well."
-0.18116661752210747," Barclays CEO says 'putting 7,000 people in a building may be thing of the past' LONDON (Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic could permanently change how many bankers make the daily trudge into tightly packed city centre offices, Barclays BARC.L CEO Jes Staley said on Wednesday. The bank, which like companies worldwide has seen the majority of its staff work from home or backup sites, will not revert fully to its pre-January working habits, Staley said. “There will be a long-term adjustment in how we think about our location strategy...the notion of putting 7,000 people in a building may be a thing of the past,” he told reporters after the bank reported a fall in first-quarter profits. Staff including investment bankers could work instead from branches as well as other locations, he said. Barclays plans to reopen its Hong Kong office first before other Asian hubs such as Singapore and Tokyo, and then Europe, Staley said. Social distancing rules will limit how many workers can return and impose restrictions, such as limiting elevators to two people at a time, he said. The comments by the head of one of Britain’s biggest banks show how business leaders are contemplating making possibly permanent alterations to work methods. Banks worldwide have in recent years increasingly shifted many staff away from expensive skyscrapers in financial hubs, but Barclays and its rivals still pack thousands of workers each into single offices in London’s Canary Wharf financial district."
-0.18116661752210747," Barclays' investment bank cushions coronavirus hit to profits LONDON (Reuters) - A stellar performance from Barclays' BARC.L investment bank in the first quarter helped to soften a blow to the bank's profits from a 2.1 billion pound bad debt provision to cover loan losses from the coronavirus crisis. The British bank booked first-quarter pretax profits of 923 million pounds on Wednesday, down 38% from 1.5 billion pounds ($1.87 billion) in the first quarter of 2019 and shy of the 1.27 billion pounds average of analysts’ forecasts compiled by the bank. Barclays said the impact of the coronavirus hit late in the first quarter and was likely to linger, striking a less positive tone than Standard Chartered STAN.L which earlier on Wednesday reported a 12% dip in profit for the period. “Given the uncertainty around the developing economic downturn and low interest rate environment, 2020 is expected to be challenging,” Chief Executive Jes Staley said. The impairments number included a 405 million pound hit from single name wholesale loan charges, while charges in its consumer, cards and payments division nearly trebled to 885 million pounds from Dec. 31, as the deteriorating economic situation increased the chances of customers missing payments. The coronavirus outbreak has hit Barclays’ credit card business particularly hard, with spending in Britain and the United States in the last week of March just half the volumes seen in the same period a year ago. Barclays said group income rose by 20% to 6.3 billion pounds, boosted by a surge in investment bank activity where pretax profits leapt by 42% to 1.2 billion pounds. The strong investment bank performance bolsters Barclays’ strategy of maintaining a diversified business model, which Staley has consistently argued as a route to recession-proof returns. The division, known as Barclays International, generated a 44% rise in income to 3.6 billion pounds, with the fixed income, currencies and commodities unit reporting a 106% income bounce as it cashed in on sharp swings in global markets. Income at its markets business rose by 77% to 2.4 billion pounds, a record quarterly performance likely to undermine a campaign led by Barclays top shareholder Sherborne Investors SIGC.L to shrink the investment bank. Equities generated a 21% rise in income while banking fees climbed by 12%. “Since the financial crisis universal banking has been out of favour. However, Barclays’ results are a good demonstration of why tying high street and investment banking together can pay dividends,” said Nicholas Hyett, Equity Analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. Barclays shares were 6.4% higher at 104 pence at 0908 GMT. Banks like Barclays have been key to UK government efforts to keep British businesses and households afloat during the COVID-19 pandemic by slashing charges, dispensing billions of pounds of state-backed loans and granting debt repayment holidays. As at April 24, Barclays said it had lent 737 million pounds via the Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan scheme, approved over 238,000 mortgage and loan payment holidays, and waived overdraft and business banking charges for more than 6 million customers. Despite the tougher economic environment, the bank said it still believed its return on tangible equity target of greater than 10% remained appropriate over time. It delivered a group ROTE of 5.1% over the first quarter, while the investment bank chalked up 12.1%. Staley said the coronavirus pandemic could permanently change how many bankers make the daily trudge into tightly packed city centre offices. “There will be a long term adjustment in how we think about our location strategy ...the notion of putting 7,000 people in a building may be a thing of the past,” he told reporters."

18.275180259587025," UK regulator ends probe of ex-Barclays banker Roger Jenkins -lawyer LONDON (Reuters) - Roger Jenkins, a former feted Barclays BARC.L rainmaker who was acquitted of fraud charges by a London jury two months ago, has now also been cleared of wrongdoing in a separate regulatory investigation, his lawyer said on Tuesday. Brad Kaufman, co-president of law firm Greenberg Traurig, who has been representing Jenkins since 2012, told Reuters that the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) had closed its inquiry into Jenkins’ role in Barclays’ emergency fundraisings from Qatar at the height of the credit crisis. “The FCA has discontinued their warning notice,” he said. “After all he has been through, and having been exonerated by the SFO (Serious Fraud Office) trial, it would have been unfair to continue with the investigation.” The FCA called Barclays “reckless” in 2013 for failing to disclose 322 million pounds ($400 million) in advisory payments to Qatari investors, whose capital injections helped the British bank avoid a state bailout in 2008. But an investigation into the bank and individuals was put on hold after the SFO launched a criminal inquiry in late 2012. In February this year, Jenkins and two other former Barclays executives were unanimously acquitted of fraud charges. The conclusion of the high-profile trial at London’s Old Bailey meant Jenkins, once dubbed the bank’s “gatekeeper” to the Qatari relationship, Tom Kalaris, who ran the wealth division, and Richard Boath, a onetime financial institutions boss, walked free. The men had all denied wrongdoing. But the end of the criminal trial also heralded the rekindling of the regulatory investigation, which could have led to executives being fined or banned from financial services. The FCA has not disclosed which individuals were in its sights. It said on Tuesday it normally did not comment about matters being considered by the Regulatory Decisions Committee, an internal panel of experts that takes enforcement and supervisory decisions on its behalf. A spokesman said in a statement that “we have strict confidentiality and privacy obligations to comply with.” Boath has said the FCA ended an investigation into him years ago. Kalaris had not been in the regulator’s sights, his lawyer said. Barclays, which said in 2013 that the FCA planned to fine it 50 million pounds for its failure to adequately disclose the Qatari advisory payments, said in its annual report published in February that it continued to contest the FCA findings."

Barclays said Chief Executive Jes Staley, Chairman Nigel Higgins and Chief Financial Officer Tushar Morzaria would all donate a third of their fixed pay for the next six months to a new 100 million pound community aid fund launched by the bank. Sabadell and its British subsidiary TSB said that senior management of both banks would give up their bonus awards for 2020, so that the banks can better reward junior staff who are helping customers deal with the virus. “It is an act of responsibility at a time when all of us need to act with the utmost commitment and solidarity,” Sabadell chairman Josep Oliu said.

21.720429363135594," Barclays sets 2050 'net zero' carbon goal after investor pressure LONDON (Reuters) - Barclays BARC.L, one of the biggest lenders in Europe to the fossil fuel industry, on Monday set itself a target to reach ""net zero"" for its own carbon emissions and the activities it finances by 2050. The British bank’s action follows pressure from a group of investors, coordinated by campaign group ShareAction, which in January filed a resolution for the lender’s shareholder meeting urging it to phase out fossil fuel lending. While Barclays stopped short of committing to that aim, calling its net zero target an “ambition”, it said it was nevertheless committed to aligning financing activities with the goals and timelines of the Paris Agreement on climate. As part of that, Barclays said it would provide targets to judge its progress and report on them regularly, starting in 2021, and would also continue to engage with investors as it develops the strategy. Given that, Barclays said it expected investors to back its own resolution. The bank did not comment on whether it recommended backing ShareAction’s resolution. Investors, politicians and activists have turned their focus towards the role the banking system plays in financing fossil fuels as a way to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy. Barclays is seventh in a list of lenders to the fossil fuel industry, with nearly $120 billion lent between 2016-2019, the most for any European bank, data from U.S. pressure group Rainforest Action Network showed. “We wanted to see leadership from Barclays on this critical issue and their proposed ambition is a significant first step,” said Diandra Soobiah, Head of Responsible Investment at pension investor NEST. NEST, which manages UK corporate pension scheme money, said it would support both the resolution from ShareAction and that put forward by Barclays. “It’s important that more details follow quickly on how Barclays will deliver these ambitious climate targets, particularly their pledge to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050,” Soobiah said. Lankelly Chase, a charitable foundation which co-filed the ShareAction resolution, said by proposing an ambition of becoming net zero rather than committing to it, Barclays was “asking permission to fall short of its own obligations.” “We need commitment not just ambition from a bank that only last year increased financing for oil, gas and coal companies by 2.9 billion pounds,” Dominic Burke, Investment Director of Lankelly Chase, said. “If a net-zero ambition does not involve phasing out fossil fuel financing, then what does it mean?” The Local Authority Pension Fund Forum, a voluntary association of 82 public sector pension funds based in the UK with combined assets of approximately 300 billion pounds ($372.03 billion), said it supported the bank’s efforts. “We are pleased to see the outcome and LAPFF has undertaken to continue to work with the company and other investors to ensure a robust plan is executed and delivered,” chairman Doug McMurdo said. Wolfgang Kuhn, ShareAction’s Director of Finance Sector Strategies, said voting for both resolutions would cement Barclays new climate commitment while also insisting on the near-term ambition needed to deliver the results everyone wants. “A climate strategy cannot be considered complete without recognising that transition necessarily means phase-out when it comes to fossil fuels, particularly the highest carbon fuels where Barclays has significant exposure,” he said.

24.434383682082732," Barclays cuts 2020 crude forecasts by $12 on virus, OPEC+ deal collapse (Reuters) - Barclays on Tuesday slashed its oil price forecasts for 2020, citing considerable downward pressure on the market from a Saudi-Russian price war and demand disruption because of the coronavirus. The bank lowered its 2020 price outlook for Brent and West Texas Intermediate by $12 each to $31 and $28 per barrel respectively. “Prices are likely to remain under pressure until the virus situation turns the corner, and if we continue on the projected market balances path, even Saudi Arabia and Russia will not be immune from the price fallout,” analysts at the bank wrote in a note. It joined several other banks in slashing their oil price forecasts on account of the collapse of an output curb deal amongst members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, or OPEC+, as well as the demand hit from the virus. Barclays also forecast global available onshore storage capacity at about 1.5 billion barrels with an estimated oversupply of over 5 million barrels per day (bpd) for this year and an oversupply of 10 million bpd on average for second quarter. Meanwhile, “strategic petroleum reserve (SPR) purchases by the U.S government are unlikely to alleviate U.S. producers’ pain,” the bank said. The available SPR storage is less than 80 million barrels, according to Department of Energy data, and would amount to a flow of less than 0.5 million bpd when filled over a period of six months, compared with almost 10 million barrels of projected oversupply over the second quarter, it added. Oil prices rose on Tuesday on hopes that the United States will reach a deal soon on a $2 trillion virus aid package which could blunt the economic impact of the outbreak and in turn support oil demand. Prices slumped over 20% after the breakdown of the OPEC+ agreement threatened to flood the market with oil."

The company is operating business as usual, Barclays spokesman Mark Lane said in a statement. The person, who worked out of the 745 7th Ave office, had been in self-quarantine since March 3. The company believes the colleague contracted the virus away from the office late last month. The European bank has advised employees who worked in the vicinity or had meetings with the individual since that time to self-quarantine for 14 days. The bank has deep-cleaned the workspace and surrounding area on the second-floor trading area, Lane said in the statement. “We are working closely with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other local authorities,” he said. “We continue to monitor the situation closely and will take further action as appropriate.” The coronavirus outbreak, which originated in China last year and causes the sometimes deadly respiratory illness COVID-19, has killed more than 4,000 globally and been reported in more than 110 countries. Banks have been fine-tuning contingency plans in recent weeks to deal with the quickly spreading coronavirus. Institutions like JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N and Bank of America Corp BAC.N have been separating members of their trading staffs and asking bankers to check their remote working capabilities to make sure they can keep operations running as authorities encourage social distancing as a preventive measure. Trading floors are particularly crucial because the need for high-speed technology and tight oversight makes trading remotely more complicated than other banking functions.

-11.9381975243405," Major Barclays investor Jupiter to back climate resolution LONDON (Reuters) - Jupiter Asset Management JUP.L, a top-25 investor in Barclays BARC.L, plans to support a shareholder resolution aimed at cutting the bank's lending to the fossil fuel industry. Banks are increasingly under pressure from policymakers and investors to do more to help in the transition to a low-carbon economy, as agreed by countries at a landmark United Nations meeting in 2015. The resolution, to be put to the bank’s annual general meeting on May 7, calls for Barclays to phase out financing to companies in the fossil fuel and utilities sectors which are not aligned with the goals of the Paris climate agreement. A group of investors coordinated by responsible investment lobby group ShareAction announced the planned resolution in January. Since then, others, including Europe's biggest asset manager, Amundi AMUN.PA, have signaled their support. This marks the first time a European bank has faced such shareholder action on fossil fuel financing. It calls on Barclays to go further than its previous public commitments to combat climate change by forcing it to set specific targets. A Barclays spokesman said: “We continue to engage with ShareAction and other shareholders on this issue and will make a further statement at the appropriate time.” The bank may make an announcement before its shareholder meeting in Glasgow to avoid a showdown vote with investors, sources told Reuters. Jupiter currently holds 1.15% of Barclays’ shares, making it one of the 25 biggest investors in the company, Refinitiv data showed. In a statement issued by ShareAction, Jupiter’s head of governance and sustainability Ashish Ray said the company expected all company boards to appropriately manage long-term risks to their business, such as climate change, and the resolution was “entirely consistent” with that approach. The disclosure of corporate plans to manage and mitigate climate-related risks is a key focus of the United Nations’ incoming climate envoy, Mark Carney, and is expected to take a central role at U.N. climate talks in Glasgow in November. Carney is due to take over as U.N. special envoy on climate finance this month after stepping down as Bank of England governor. Specifically, Carney is keen for companies to use the Taskforce on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) risk-assessment framework. Jupiter’s Ray said: “We firmly support the recommendations of TCFD, which recognizes climate change as a board-level issue and seeks disclosure of strategic planning in relation to climate risks, including practical responses to both physical and transition risks.” Hedge fund billionaire and climate activism backer Chris Hohn has written to Barclays and several rivals urging them to reveal the scale of lending to the coal sector and classify loans made to the sector as high risk."

-23.376614214428155," 'Big Dog' and the 'omnipotent sheikh' - how Qatar saved Barclays LONDON (Reuters) - When Roger Jenkins was asked to help Barclays avoid a state bailout at the height of the financial crisis in 2008, he was expecting a bonus not a prosecution for his efforts. More than a decade later, Jenkins and former Barclays colleagues Richard Boath and Tom Kalaris, were unanimously acquitted by a jury on Friday in a case that revealed how the British banking giant secured a 4 billion pound ($5.2 billion) investment from Qatar. With its survival at risk, Barclays was relying on Jenkins’ persuasiveness and personal relationship with Qatar’s then prime minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani. But the tiny emirate, which has punched above its weight for years after the discovery of oil and gas, was playing hardball. Barclays’ response was to pursue a deal which Jenkins conceded during his trial was optically “close to the line”. The four month trial at London’s Old Bailey criminal court shone a light on the punishing globe-trotting schedules, meetings in luxury hotels and often surreal negotiations which pulled Barclays back from the brink. Jenkins, known as “Big Dog” to colleagues, sat in the witness box for weeks, shedding some light on how one of the world’s biggest banks pulled out the stops to court a man referred to during proceedings as “the omnipotent sheikh”. The Gulf state had a reputation as a tough negotiator and in June 2008, Qatar Holding, part of the $300 billion Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) sovereign wealth fund, demanded more than twice the fees Barclays had promised other investors. The Qatari investment was key. It helped pave the way for other financial backers, such as Sheikh Mansour of Abu Dhabi, Singapore’s state investor Temasek and Japan’s Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corp, allowing Barclays to raise around 11 billion pounds that year across two capital raisings. But the deals struck by the bank -- an extra 322 million pounds paid to Qatar under two Advisory Services Agreements (ASAs) -- landed the former bankers in court with fraud charges. Prosecutors had alleged the side deals were shams, designed only to pay Qatar extra fees. Jenkins, Boath and Kalaris maintained they were intended as genuine, commercial agreements and had been approved by directors and lawyers as mechanisms to secure lucrative advisory and banking business generated by Qatar. Sheikh Hamad and Qatar, still a leading investor in Barclays and Britain after a 35-billion-pound acquisition spree of trophy assets, were not accused of wrongdoing. A statement released on behalf of Sheikh Hamad said the ASAs proposed by Barclays had been genuine. “Out of respect for the due processes of English law, Sheikh Hamad and the other Qatari parties did not seek to intervene during the course of the trial to correct those errors of fact and misleading interpretations that appeared to be given currency in some quarters,” Friday’s statement said. In the Gulf, personal relationships and trust are paramount and banks pay millions to those who can gain and sustain it. Jenkins had forged a relationship with billionaire Sheikh Hamad, who caused a stir in early 2008 when he told world leaders in Davos that he wanted to pump $15 billion into banks. The pair were first introduced in 2007 through a friend of Jenkins’ former wife Diana while on holiday on the Italian island of Sardinia, he told the court. Bonding over dinner and discussions about supermarket investments on the sheikh’s yacht, Jenkins and his wife were later invited to Sheikh Hamad’s French house in Cannes. As the relationship blossomed, Jenkins flew to Doha and helped arrange meetings with Barclays directors and the sheikh and his officials at luxury London hotels as well as at Jenkins’ mansion in London’s Mayfair district, in Doha and New York. Without such introductions, things were bleak. Bob Diamond, the charismatic American executive who would become Barclays chief executive in 2010, was left sitting in a lobby in Abu Dhabi “for days on end” when he first tried to forge a relationship with UAE sheikhs, the court was told. Diamond was not accused of any wrongdoing. His spokesman was not immediately available for comment. With Barclays under pressure in roiling markets, Jenkins knew he had a poor negotiating hand in June 2008. In a culture in which meetings were unscheduled, could be at any time within a two-day period and might be over in 15 minutes, he was asked to wait overnight for a meeting with Sheikh Hamad. But he did not want to betray weakness. His tactic, he told the jury, was to fly to Dubai, fabricating a meeting there to give the impression he was in high demand in the Middle East, before returning to Doha. “I did not want to sit in Doha and wait for His Excellency for 48 hours ... That would be a sign of weakness in the negotiation,” he said during cross-examination. Four months later, Barclays extended the ASA with Qatar for another 280 million pounds as the Gulf state again invested in the British bank alongside Abu Dhabi investors.

-23.376614214428155," Factbox: Barclays bosses cleared of credit crisis-era fraud LONDON (Reuters) - Three former Barclays executives were cleared of credit-crisis era fraud charges by a jury on Friday after a landmark London trial over undisclosed payments to Qatar in 2008. Below are some details about the three defendants. Once dubbed Britain’s best-paid banker, Jenkins held the golden key to the Qatari deal -- a personal relationship with former prime minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani. Jenkins owned 60 million pounds of Barclays stock and was recommended for a 25 million pound bonus for his work on the 2008 fundraisings. The Scottish-born former sprinter, who earned millions at Barclays devising complex tax structures, helped secure a second deal with Qatar in October 2008 despite suffering a heart attack two months earlier. On June 26, 2008, Barclays’ then CEO John Varley emailed Jenkins saying: “We could not have done what we have done without the pivotal role you played. Thank you for the extraordinary skill and tenacity.” By the time he left Barclays in 2009 to become an independent consultant, he had amassed a 120 million pound fortune, according to the 2009 Sunday Times Rich list. The investment banker, who headed the bank’s wealth division, was the trusted lieutenant of Bob Diamond, the charismatic American who would succeed Varley as CEO. Kalaris left the bank in 2013. Born in Tripoli, Libya, to a senior American diplomat father and civil rights lawyer mother, Kalaris spent his formative years at JPMorgan before joining Barclays. Married for 41 years with five children, Kalaris described himself during the trial as the “quarterback” in the pressure-cooker atmosphere at Barclays during the 2008 fundraisings. He was hand-picked by Diamond because of his even temperament and helped shield Boath from excessive demands from the bank’s top management. Kalaris, now 64, has a “highly developed sense of duty, akin to that of a professional soldier,” ex-Barclays chairman David Walker said in a character witness statement read in court. The SFO case hinged on the recorded telephone calls and interviews with now 61-year-old Boath, the former European head of the investment bank’s financial institutions group. Boath was the only one of the defendants to answer investigator questions in 2014 and 2016 -- and the only one not to testify at the Old Bailey criminal court. He was picked to help execute the June 2008 fundraising, despite his background in the separate discipline of debt deals. By a quirk of bank practice at the time, the fact he sat on the trading floor meant his phone calls were recorded, unlike the other bankers in the case. Boath was fired in 2016 after a 15-year career at the bank and is suing Barclays over whistleblowing, pay and unfair dismissal. He alleges he was dismissed because of what he told SFO investigators. His case has been put on hold pending an outcome of the criminal prosecution."
-23.376614214428155," Ex-Barclays bankers cleared over 2008 Qatar fees in blow to UK fraud office LONDON (Reuters) - Three former Barclays executives were unanimously acquitted on Friday of charges they helped funnel 322 million pounds ($418 million) in secret fees to Qatar in return for rescue financing during the credit crisis. A jury at London’s Old Bailey criminal court cleared Roger Jenkins, Tom Kalaris and Richard Boath of fraud after just five hours of deliberation in what lawyers said was a crushing blow to the UK’s taxpayer-funded Serious Fraud Office (SFO). The men, aged between 61 and 64, had all denied wrongdoing. Jenkins, a rainmaker described as the “gatekeeper” to the Qataris, said he had “lived under a cloud” since the investigation began around eight years ago. “This has taken an enormous toll on me both economically and personally, and I look forward now to rebuilding my life,” he said in a statement. Boath, the bank’s former financial institutions boss, told reporters waiting in the rain outside the court that the case had been a “complete invention” and that a regulatory probe had cleared him years ago. Asked about his plans, he said: “I’m going for lunch.” The verdict draws a line under an ambitious inquiry that led to the first British criminal charges against senior financiers at a major bank over conduct during the credit crisis. It also marks the likely end of efforts by prosecutors to hold top bankers to account for decisions taken when a global financial meltdown triggered vast taxpayer bailouts of banks. The SFO, which filed charges a month after the ruling Conservative Party pledged to abolish the agency and roll it into a national crime-fighting force in 2017, said it remained determined to pursue perpetrators of serious financial crime. But the case, which the SFO estimated has cost around 10 million pounds, was tricky. The most senior defendant, former CEO John Varley, was acquitted last June for lack of evidence and the case against Barclays, which centered on alleged unlawful financial assistance to Qatar through a $3 billion loan, was dismissed in 2018. Zoe Osborne, a lawyer at Steptoe & Johnson, said it had been “absolutely the wrong case to pursue”. “It is a crushing loss that should be seen by the SFO as a painful lesson that it needs to heed,” said Aziz Rahman, a lawyer at Rahman Ravelli. Qatar Holding, part of the $300 billion Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) sovereign wealth fund, and Challenger, former Qatari prime minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani’s investment vehicle, ploughed about 4 billion pounds into Barclays in June and October 2008. The SFO alleged Jenkins, Kalaris and Boath conspired with ex-finance director Chris Lucas to disguise an extra 42 million pound payment with a bogus, three-year advisory services agreement (ASA) after the Gulf state demanded more than twice the fees Barclays was paying other investors in June 2008. Jenkins was also charged over the bank’s subsequent, 280 million pound, five-year ASA struck with Qatar four months later, as the bank tapped investors for a second time in a two-part, 11 billion pound fundraising. The men said the ASAs were intended as genuine mechanisms to pay Qatar what it wanted while extracting lucrative, commercial business from Qatar, that such side deals were common in banking, that senior directors had authorized the parameters of negotiations and, along with lawyers, had approved the deals. Qatar’s QIA, which said in a statement it remains a “committed shareholder, investor and partner to Barclays”, was neither investigated nor accused of wrongdoing. “Our investments in Barclays created a strategic partnership with the bank and were part of our plan to build a global financial portfolio,” a spokesperson said. A statement issued on behalf of Sheikh Hamad said that the ASAs were genuine and had provided for potential substantial transactions. A lawyer for Lucas, who was not charged because he was too ill to stand trial, declined to comment. Much of the case was built on recorded conversations on the telephone line of Boath, nicknamed “Nervous Nellie” by his counsel. Boath fretted the June ASA looked “dodgy”, that it could be seen as a “bung” and said he felt sick at the thought of having to demonstrate to authorities that Qatar had provided services, transcripts of conversations and SFO interviews showed. But Boath also said he had been reassured after seniors approved the deal and had confidence that Jenkins would get the value back from Qatar. “He is a very impressive individual,” he told the SFO in 2014, transcripts shown to the court showed. Defense lawyers said Boath had not fully grasped that Sheikh Hamad could provide Barclays with lucrative, commercial business opportunities by just opening his rolodex. Jenkins, who was recommended a 25 million pound bonus for his work in 2008, told the jury that Sheikh Hamad would have been insulted if he had been asked to spell out his promises, but that he had believed “with a passion” in the ASAs. After a heart attack in early August 2008, Jenkins said he was ordered back to work a month later to help save Barclays. The case does not end legal action over the way Barclays behaved during the financial crisis. The bank is still contesting a 1 billion pound-plus civil lawsuit from businesswoman Amanda Staveley, who arranged an investment from Abu Dhabi investors. And the Financial Conduct Authority markets regulator in 2013 proposed a 50 million pound fine over how Barclays made disclosures about its dealings with Qatar. That investigation has been on hold pending the outcome of the criminal case. ($1 = 0.7696 pounds)"
-23.376614214428155," Breakingviews - Barclays 2008 gamble has nuanced investor legacy LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Barclays has mostly shrugged off the shroud of its Qatari crisis-era cash call. A London jury on Friday acquitted three senior ex-employees of fraud in connection with the 2008 capital raising. Former Chief Executive John Varley was cleared last June, while a case against the bank itself was dismissed in 2018. Yet the saga leaves a nuanced legacy for investors in the 26 billion pound lender. The latest acquittal is embarrassing for Britain’s Serious Fraud Office, which alleged that the bankers helped funnel secret fees to Qatar in connection with a two-stage, 11 billion pound fundraising in 2008. Defendants Roger Jenkins, Tom Kalaris and Richard Boath denied wrongdoing, and said the payments were designed to help secure lucrative business from the resource-rich Gulf state. The jury’s acquittal of the three men may increase political pressure on the SFO: Britain’s ruling Conservative Party had previously pledged to scrap the body. For investors, the main consequence of the Qatari episode was that Barclays forestalled a state bailout, unlike domestic peers Royal Bank of Scotland and Lloyds Banking Group. Its stock-market record ever since is unequivocal. Barclays shareholders saw an annualised return including dividends of minus 5% between the start of 2008 and the end of 2019. Lloyds’ equivalent figure over the same period was minus 8%, while RBS’ was an even more woeful minus 18%, Refinitiv data indicates. Government cash comes at a heavy price for banks, whose executives are typically cleared out. Barclays’ independence allowed the lender to keep its large investment bank, rather than go through an RBS-style restructuring of the wholesale business. Such exercises absorb capital that could otherwise be paid out to shareholders. Yet RBS and Lloyds’ painful overhauls also brought greater strategic clarity. Their shares are now priced at 65% and 91% of respective tangible book value, using the median 2020 Refinitiv estimate. Barclays, whose low-returning investment bank exerts a drag on its valuation, trades at a more humble 53% of tangible book. That will change if investors stop punishing lenders, like Barclays, who lean heavily on volatile markets-based businesses. For now, though, it’s enough to mean that the final assessment of the bank’s Qatari fundraising remains nuanced."

One of the most ambitious cases brought by the UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO) hinges on how Barclays struck side deals worth 322 million pounds ($417 million) with Qatar as the wealthy Gulf state pumped about 4 billion pounds into the British bank in June and October 2008.

Judge Andrew Popplewell has told the jury to put aside views about bankers, their bonuses and the financial crash, saying the case turned on circumstantial evidence and how the defendants behaved against the backdrop of the credit crunch. “Whether or not you think that these defendants or bankers in general deserve the bonuses they get paid for doing the job they were doing and for the money that they were making for the bank -- that has no bearing on their guilt or innocence in this case,” he told the jury. Prosecutor Ed Brown alleged the men devised bogus side deals, called Advisory Services Agreements (ASAs), to satisfy Qatar’s demand for higher fees than other investors and never intended Barclays to receive any commercial services in return. He alleged they lied to the market and other shareholders through the bank’s public documents, as payments for the ASAs were not disclosed. The defendants agreed that the ASAs were mechanisms to ensure Qatari investors received what they wanted, but denied they were a fee for investing in the bank. They said the ASAs were legitimate, separate advisory deals, that had been cleared by internal and external lawyers and senior directors, and were intended to secure genuine, valuable business in a region it was keen to expand into. ‘ABSENCE OF EVIDENCE’ John Kelsey-Fry, representing Jenkins, said the prosecution had failed to spot the “total absence of evidence or logic” supporting allegations the ASAs were false. “There have been so many hares set running by the prosecution in this case, the field is positively flooded with them running around in every direction crashing into each other,” he said. The defendants are accused of conspiring with former finance director Chris Lucas to commit fraud by false representation and also face a separate charge of fraud by false representation. Jenkins, Kalaris and Boath face both charges over the first fundraising in June 2008, when Qatar received an extra 42 million pounds for a three-year ASA. Jenkins also faces both charges over the second capital call, when Qatar received another 280 million pounds for another, five-year ASA. Brown has told the jury that Lucas, who he alleged was “at the center of the scheme to provide the Qataris with their fee”, would have been charged had he not been too ill to stand trial. Lucas was not represented in court. His lawyer declined to comment."

Barclays this month disclosed it is being investigated by the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority over Chief Executive Staley’s past links to Epstein, who killed himself in August while awaiting trial in the United States on sex trafficking charges. Sherborne CEO Edward Bramson said in a letter to Barclays shareholders, which was seen by Reuters, that the fallout was “another example of governance weakness that has led, inevitably, to the recurrent public disappointments and embarrassments which have plagued Barclays”. Staley has said he regrets having any relationship with Epstein, telling reporters earlier this month that he did not know the U.S. financier’s real nature. The regulatory probes focus on whether Staley was honest in his characterisation of that relationship. Barclays declined to comment. It has previously said that Staley never engaged or paid fees to Epstein to advise him or provide professional services. The inquiry is the second regulatory investigation into Staley’s conduct in recent years, after the FCA and PRA fined him 642,000 pounds in 2018 for trying to identify a whistleblower who sent letters criticizing a Barclays employee. Bramson also renewed his long-running calls for Staley to cut back Barclays’ investment bank, which makes lower returns than other parts of the business. It has been around a year since Bramson met with Barclays Chairman Nigel Higgins to discuss his concerns, he added. Bramson’s efforts to secure a board seat at Barclays were defeated in a vote at its annual shareholder meeting last year.

The possible shake-up comes as Britain’s financial regulators are probing links between Staley and the U.S. financier Jeffrey Epstein, who killed himself while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges, after the FT reported on a trove of emails between the two earlier this month. Staley, who took over as CEO in 2015, has told colleagues he expects to leave Barclays by the end of 2021 and could step down at the annual meeting in May next year, the report said. Barclays is set to appoint an external headhunting firm — possibly Spencer Stuart or Egon Zehnder — to identify potential external successors and the process could take up to a year, the FT reported. The change in top brass at Barclays would follow the change of guard at Europe’s top banks including Royal Bank of Scotland , UBS and Credit Suisse.

-46.54378043289031," Barclays chief Staley probed over Epstein ties LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s financial regulators are probing links between Barclays Chief Executive Jes Staley and the U.S. financier Jeffrey Epstein, who killed himself while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges, after the Financial Times reported on a trove of emails between the two on Thursday. Barclays disclosed earlier in the day that its board had looked into media reports on Staley’s relationship with Epstein, and probed the chief executive’s characterization of it. U.K. regulators launched their investigations into links between Staley and Epstein after JPMorgan Chase & Co’s provided them with emails the two exchanged when Staley was the head of JPMorgan’s private bank, the Financial Times reported on Thursday. Barclays confirmed the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Prudential Regulation Authority were now investigating the matter. The bank did not give further details on the probe. Barclays, JPMorgan and the FCA declined to comment on the FT’s report. The Prudential Regulation Authority did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Earlier on Thursday, the bank said its board believes the chief executive has been sufficiently transparent about his ties to Epstein, whom Staley said he had not seen since taking over as Barclays CEO in 2015. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, Staley said he regretted his relationship with Epstein, which began in 2000 while he was employed by JPMorgan and “tapered off significantly” after he left the Wall Street lender. The relationship ended in late 2015, Staley said. “I thought I knew him well, and I didn’t. I’m sure with hindsight of what we all know now, I deeply regret having had any relationship with Jeffrey Epstein,” he said. The New York Times last year said that Epstein had referred “dozens” of wealthy clients to Staley when the CEO ran JPMorgan’s private banking business. There have been no public disclosures about regulatory investigations into JPMorgan’s links to Epstein. It also reported that Staley visited Epstein in prison when he was serving a sentence between 2008-09 for soliciting prostitution. Staley also went to Epstein’s private island in 2015, Bloomberg reported. Barclays has previously said that Staley never engaged or paid fees to Epstein to advise him or provide professional services. The probe is the second regulatory investigation into Staley’s conduct in recent years, after the FCA and PRA fined him 642,000 pounds in 2018 for trying to identify a whistleblower who sent letters criticizing a Barclays employee. Barclays shares fell 2.3% on Thursday. “This is clearly a cause for concern for investors; if Mr Staley were forced out it would create significant uncertainty for shareholders,” said Peter Parry, policy director at investor group ShareSoc. “Mr Staley’s judgment was called into question less than two years ago with the whistle-blowing scandal. And to make matters worse, it distracts attention from the announcement of Barclays results today.” Staley received a bumper pay package of 5.9 million pounds ($7.6 million) in 2019, up from 3.36 million a year earlier. The sum was boosted by the paying out of a long-term incentive plan worth 1.48 million pounds. His bonus also rose to 1.65 million pounds, reflecting the bank’s strong annual performance. Both Staley and Finance Director Tushar Morzaria took cuts to their pension allowances in 2019, and will now receive fixed cash contributions equating to 10% of salary in line with the broader workforce. Lower-paid employees will see their employer pension contributions rise to 12%. The bank’s bonus pool fell 10%. Barclays reported on Thursday a better-than-expected profit before tax of 6.2 billion pounds for 2019, as its investment bank posted bumper returns from fixed-income trading. Its profit was 9% higher than in 2018 and above the 5.7 billion pound average of analysts’ forecasts compiled by the bank. The British lender also reiterated its ambition of achieving a 10% return on equity this year, although it repeated a warning from October that the worsening economic outlook might make reaching that target difficult. Staley has said that Barclays’ mix of investment and retail banking businesses should partly insulate it from economic and market fluctuations. Barclays paid a dividend of 9 pence for the year, compared with 6.5 pence for 2018, as its core capital ratio came in at a better-than-expected 13.8%."
-46.54378043289031," Breakingviews - Jes Staley’s old associate haunts Barclays revival ZURICH (Reuters Breakingviews) - Barclays shareholders have a new headache to add to an older problem. The British bank on Thursday said regulators were probing Chief Executive Jes Staley’s characterisation of his relationship with U.S. financier Jeffrey Epstein, who killed himself while awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges. At the same time, the American admitted that his plan to lift Barclays’ return on tangible equity to 10% by 2020 looks tricky. The new revelations serve as an unwelcome distraction for investors worrying that the financial goal is out of reach. Staley’s past relationship with Epstein was well known. The New York Times last year reported that the financier had referred “dozens” of wealthy clients to the former JPMorgan executive; Staley says he had no contact with Epstein since taking charge of Barclays in 2015. The surprise is that Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority and Prudential Regulation Authority are investigating Staley’s representations about his professional dealings with Epstein, and the company’s subsequent response to inquiries. The bank’s board said on Thursday that it believes Staley has been “sufficiently transparent”. It’s unclear what the ramifications will be if regulators think otherwise. But the probe is another stain on Staley’s personal reputation. In 2018 he was fined 642,000 pounds for trying to identify a whistle-blower who sent letters criticising an employee of the bank. That will worry investors who are counting on Staley to pump the bank’s ROTE closer to its probable 10% cost of equity. Last year the key metric reached 9%, excluding fines and legal charges. Staley clung to the 10% ambition on Thursday, but admitted it had become harder given low interest rates and a “challenging macroeconomic environment”. To hit Staley’s goal this year, Barclays will need to generate almost 5 billion pounds of earnings, based on consensus estimates of tangible book value. That requires a heroic 16% jump from last year’s level. Barclays shares, which fell 3% on Thursday morning, trade at a 33% discount to the bank’s tangible book value, implying that shareholders think Staley will fail. A renewed focus on his old associate will only cement that cut-price valuation."

-43.30269352008063," Barclays sees $2/bbl impact to oil prices as virus fears threaten demand (Reuters) - Barclays said on Tuesday oil prices will be impacted by $2 per barrel on the potential economic fallout from the coronavirus outbreak in China. More than 100 people have died and over 4,000 cases of the new virus have been confirmed in China, leading authorities to increase preventive measures, impose travel restrictions and also extend the Lunar New Year holidays to limit the spread of the virus. The bank sees a $2 per barrel downside to their full-year Brent and WTI forecasts of $62 per barrel and $57 per barrel, respectively. Compounding the effects of the spillover to economic growth from China and the region, Barclays expects transitory oil demand erosion of about 0.6-0.8 million barrels per day (mb/d) in the first quarter of this year, or 0.2 mb/d for the full year. “If air passenger traffic in China declined by half in first quarter of 2020, it would likely lead to a 300,000 barrels per day year on year decline in jet-kerosene demand from China,” the bank said adding the fall in road transport would likely be less severe than in the past given reduced reliance on buses. Barclays expects the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and other allies to step in and take further measures to keep the markets tight, in case the fall in demand is more acute. Oil prices have been down for the last six sessions, but the bank said that the market reaction was likely overdone. Barclays said the actual economic fallout from the coronavirus could be less severe than the 2003 SARS outbreak, given that the new virus seems less lethal than SARS so far and the measures taken by Chinese authorities. The bank said the geopolitical risks to global supplies remain high as U.S.-Iran tensions could continue to gradually escalate and oil production in Libya could fall further if the blockade of key infrastructure facilities continues. Brent crude prices LCOc1 are currently trading around $59 per barrel and U.S. WTI at around at $53 per barrel."
-47.96501732102003," Former Barclays CEO suggested Qatari side deal in 2008, London court hears LONDON (Reuters) - Former Barclays BARC.L chief executive John Varley first suggested the bank could use a side deal to satisfy Qatar's demands for extra cash in return for rescue funding for the bank during the 2008 credit crisis, a London court heard on Tuesday. Thomas Kalaris, one of three former top Barclays bankers who deny fraud linked to the capital raising, on Tuesday described a meeting with a senior Qatari official on June 3, 2008, and how he subsequently took the service lift to Varley’s office on the 31st floor of the bank to discuss the Gulf state’s fee demands. The case revolves around how Barclays avoided the fate of Lloyds LLOY.L and Royal Bank of Scotland RBS.L and averted a state bailout with an 11 billion pound ($14.3 billion) fundraising in June and October 2008. But the Gulf state, which became the largest single investor in Barclays, first asked for a fee of 3.75% in return for its investment -- substantially above the 1.5% the bank was offering other investors, the jury has heard. “His (Varley’s) immediate reaction was that he would be prepared to offer value of 3.5%...,” Kalaris told the jury at the Old Bailey criminal court, as he began his testimony. “He said it should be done via a side agreement”, he said, adding this was “quite common” in banking and “absolutely not” dishonest. Varley was acquitted of fraud charges last year and is not accused of any wrongdoing. Prosecutors for the UK Serious Fraud Office allege the three former executives lied to the market and other investors by not properly disclosing 322 million pounds paid to Qatar, disguising them as “bogus” advisory services agreements (ASAs) in return for around four billion pounds in investments over 2008. Kalaris, who ran the bank’s wealth division, Roger Jenkins, the former head of the bank’s Middle East business and Richard Boath, a former head of European financial institutions, deny conspiring to commit fraud and fraud by false representation. The men have said the ASAs were designed to be genuine side deals to secure lucrative business for Barclays in the Middle East -- a region the bank was eager to exploit -- and were approved by lawyers and cleared by the board. Kalaris, 64, agreed his role in the June 2008 capital raising could be described as a “quarterback” and involved, in part, ensuring decision makers “understood what was going on”. “Did you think for a moment that Mr Varley was instructing that there should be some form of dishonest or hidden nature to the balancing payment, whatever that amount would need to be?” Kalaris’s lawyer, Ian Winter, asked. “Never,” Kalaris responded.

-46.71098725747312," Former Barclays banker ordered out of bed after 2008 heart attack to help save bank LONDON (Reuters) - A senior former Barclays BARC.L banker told a London fraud trial on Thursday that he was ordered out of bed after a heart attack to help save the lender at the height of the credit crisis. Roger Jenkins is on trial with two other former Barclays executives over how the bank secured around 4.0 billion pounds ($5.2 billion) in rescue financing from the Gulf state in 2008. Jenkins, who was recommended for a 25 million pound bonus for arranging the Qatari investment over June and October 2008, was briefly rattled when prosecutor Edward Brown asked whether he had merely sought to look after his own interests. “So in answer to your question, Mr Brown, ... I had a heart attack on August 5 (2008) and I was instructed to get out of my bed, leave my family on August 29 and come back to work to help this bank survive,” 64-year-old Jenkins told the jury at the Old Bailey criminal court. Barclays avoided the fate of rivals Lloyds LLOY.L and Royal Bank of Scotland RBS.L and averted a state bailout by raising a total of 11 billion pounds over 2008. But prosecutors for the UK Serious Fraud Office allege the three men lied to the market and other investors about 322 million pounds in extra fees paid to Qatar, disguised as “bogus” advisory services agreements (ASAs). Jenkins, the former head of Barclays’ Middle East business, Tom Kalaris, who ran its wealth division, and Richard Boath, a former head of European financial institutions, deny conspiring to commit fraud by false representation and fraud by false representation, each carrying a maximum 10-year sentence. Jenkins, once known as the “gatekeeper to Qatar” because of his close personal relationship with Qatar’s former prime minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani, said the ASAs were approved by lawyers and designed to provide value for Barclays as an investment for genuine services. “Value is the umbrella that covers services, advice, introduction, deal flow -- it is that which I hang my hat on,” he told the jury. Asked why Gay Huey Evans, a former Barclays manager tasked with building relationships with sovereign wealth funds in 2008, did not know about deals for additional services from Qatar, Jenkins said her evidence was “very surprising”. But he said he had been too busy to “tick boxes” to check how the investment under the ASAs was being monetized during the febrile atmosphere in 2008, when executives stood to lose their bonuses and jobs and banks stood on the brink of collapse. “I’m sorry I did not tick the boxes and deal with this. It was done later,” he said."
-9.2361096865102," Barclays joins rivals with cuts to CEO pension perks LONDON (Reuters) - Barclays BARC.L is planning to cut the 396,000 pounds ($508,068) pension allowance it pays Chief Executive Jes Staley by around half, echoing moves by rivals who have pledged to rein in executive pension perks following a campaign by investors. The British lender is consulting shareholders on the proposal in a review of its remuneration policy to be voted on at the bank’s annual meeting next year, a source with knowledge of the matter said. The possible changes follow protests from investors and employee unions over the disparity between pension payouts offered to Britain’s top bank bosses and their staff. HSBC HSBA.L and Royal Bank of Scotland RBS.L have pledged to set pension contributions paid to their CEOs at 10% of base salary, matching those paid to their wider workforces. Barclays is looking to boost typical pension contributions paid to employees from 10% to 12.5%, the source added. But Staley’s new cash payment would equate to around 17% of the 1.18 million pound annual salary he was paid last year, suggesting Barclays is stopping short of full harmonization, risking further investor dissent and scrutiny from policymakers. “It’s a start but these cuts do not really go far enough. There’s no real reason why CEO pension payments shouldn’t be completely in line with other staff,” Peter Parry, policy director at investor group ShareSoc told Reuters. “There is always a worry that when companies rein in pay in one area, they compensate for it in another area. The sad thing is that executive pay is now out of control,” he said. Standard Chartered STAN.L still plans to pay its top two executives double the pension benefits it pays to general staff. Earlier this month it said it would reduce the payouts to CEO Bill Winters and Chief Financial Officer Andy Halford from 20% to 10% of total salary, which includes both base pay and a fixed pay allowance paid in shares. But as a proportion of base salary alone, the benefit falls from 40% to 20%, compared with 10% for its staff. The changes mean that Winters’ pension allowance in 2020 will drop to 237,000 pounds and Halford’s to 147,000 pounds. Lloyds Banking Group LLOY.L plans to cut the pension allowance paid to its Chief Executive Antonio Horta-Osorio by 228,000 pounds, a source familiar with the situation said. Horta-Osorio, the longest-serving of Britain’s top banking bosses, pocketed a contribution of around 419,000 pounds this year, equating to 33% of his 1.27 million pounds base salary. The cut would see his allowance as a percentage of base salary drop to 15%, in line with the maximum contribution the bank plans to offer other staff from 2020. Horta-Osorio was the sector’s best-paid CEO in 2018, earning a 6.3 million pounds compensation package. Santander UK is now the only major UK lender yet to reform its generous executive pension arrangements. Its Chief Executive Nathan Bostock takes home a pension allowance equivalent to 35% of his base pay. The arrangements are under review, a source close to the matter said. At 3.4 million pounds, Staley’s total remuneration package at Barclays for 2018 - which also included a share-based payment of 1.2 million pounds and a 1.1 million pounds bonus - was the lowest among Britain’s bank bosses. Staley’s proposed pension allowance cut was first reported by the Financial Times."
-4.20932218447435," Ex-Barclays banker taken aback by fees Qatar demanded, court hears LONDON, Nov 26 (Reuters) - Roger Jenkins, a former senior Barclays banker tasked with securing a financial lifeline from Qatar at the height of the credit crisis, told a London fraud trial on Tuesday he had been taken aback at the fees demanded by the Gulf state. Jenkins, 64, told a jury at the Old Bailey criminal court that he had expected Hussain Al-Abdullah, the negotiator for Qatar’s former prime minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani, to play hardball when he and colleagues met him in his suite at London’s luxury Claridges Hotel on June 3, 2008. But he said he was surprised when Al-Abdulla, known as Dr Hussain, demanded a fee of 3.75 percent for participating in the first part of what would become an 11 billion pound ($14 billion), two part capital raising over 2008. “It was a surprising ask on his side; the size of it,” said Jenkins, giving evidence for the second day in the high-profile trial. “I knew that he would ask for something -- it’s the nature. I had expected 2%, maybe 2.5%. I hadn’t expected the magnitude of the ask, so I was a little taken aback.” The case revolves around how Barclays avoided the fate of Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland and averted a state bailout with an 11 billion pound ($14 billion) fundraising in June and October 2008. Jenkins, the former head of Barclays’ Middle East business, and co-defendants Tom Kalaris, who ran its wealth division, and Richard Boath, a former head of European financial institutions, deny conspiring to commit fraud by false representation and fraud by false representation. Prosecutors for the UK Serious Fraud Office allege the former executives lied to the market and other investors by not properly disclosing 322 million pounds paid to Qatar, disguised as “bogus” advisory services agreements (ASAs), in return for around four billion pounds in investments over 2008. Qatar, a major investor in Britain, and Sheikh Hamad are not accused of wrongdoing. In brief defence statements, the men have alleged that the ASAs were side deals to secure lucrative business for Barclays in the Middle East -- a region the bank was eager to exploit -- that had been approved by internal and external lawyers and cleared by the board. Jenkins told the court how he courted Sheikh Hamad and his senior executives, discussed a range of investment opportunities and offered to send a chief operating officer and risk officer to Doha for a year to advise the oil and gas rich country, which was keen to diversify its wealth, on asset allocation. Jenkins, a former competitive sprinter who was once one of Britain’s best paid bankers, also introduced Dr Hussain to London-based property mogul Robert Tchenguiz in late May 2008 to discuss the performance of supermarket chain Sainsbury’s , in which both had a significant stake, according to emails shown to the jury. John Kelsey-Fry, Jenkins’ lawyer, asked whether Barclays had been paid for the time spent trying to find staff to second to Doha. “It didn’t cost me very much, just a few phone calls,” Jenkins responded. “Why are you doing it?” his lawyer, asked. “To assist,” Jenkins said. The trial is scheduled to last about five months."
-4.081629027191661," Ex-Barclays executive says Qatar wanted to be its 'special' Gulf partner LONDON (Reuters) - Former senior Barclays BARC.L executive Roger Jenkins told a fraud trial over undisclosed payments by the bank during the credit crisis that Qatar had wanted to be the British bank's ""special"" Gulf partner in 2008. The former head of Barclays’ Middle East business, and co-defendants Tom Kalaris, who ran its wealth division, and Richard Boath, a former head of European financial institutions, deny conspiring to commit fraud by false representation and fraud by false representation. Giving evidence for the first time in the landmark London case, Jenkins, 64, said on Monday he first met former prime minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani, who was also head of Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund, in July 2007 in Sardinia. Jenkins said the two men had dinner on a boat on the Italian island and met subsequently on the French Riviera at Cannes, in Los Angeles, Doha and London to discuss business deals in retail, real estate and banks as their relationship developed. The case revolves around how Barclays avoided the fate of Lloyds LLOY.L and Royal Bank of Scotland RBS.L and averted a state bailout with an 11 billion pound ($14 billion) fundraising in June and October 2008. Prosecutors allege the bankers lied to the market and other investors by not properly disclosing 322 million pounds of extra payments to Qatar, disguising them as “bogus” advisory services agreements. Qatar, a major investor in Britain, and Sheikh Hamad are not accused of any wrongdoing. When Barclays started to cast around for cornerstone investors during the financial crisis Jenkins, who was known as “Big Dog” by colleagues, wanted to bring in Qatar, which was seeking to diversify its vast oil and gas wealth. On May 14, 2008, Kalaris emailed Jenkins to ask whether Sheikh Hamad had “any sensitivity” about Barclays approaching other potential investors, such as Abu Dhabi or Kuwait, or whether he wanted to be an exclusive Middle East player. Jenkins, who read his emailed response out in court, said: “Oh yes he won’t like that. He wants to be (the) special Gulf guy.” But Qatar had also watched RBS’s steeply-discounted emergency rights, Jenkins said, and was a tough negotiator. “They will have seen the RBS rights issue with a 42% discount so they would be pushing us as hard as possible to apply that discount to this transaction and apply an appropriate fee to this transaction,” he told the jury. The one-time graduate trainee rose to prominence at Barclays’ structured capital markets division, which grew rapidly by helping clients navigate tax rules. Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund, which was only set up in 2005, was also booming and seeking investments. As cracks appeared in financial markets, Jenkins said Sheikh Hamad became increasingly interested in investing in banks. Jenkins, who described his relationship with the sheikh as close, is due to continue giving evidence in a trial scheduled to last around five months."

The company and its advisors are sounding out interest from mining firms already operating in Peru for the copper-gold project that could fetch up to $500 million, one of the sources said. However, the project would need a further injection of more than $1 billion before it can start production, the source said. A representative for Teck company declined to comment on the report, citing company policy not to comment on speculation. A Barclays representative was not immediately available for comment. Japan's Mitsubishi Materials Corp 5711.T, which owns the remaining 20% of Zafranal, was also not immediately available to comment. The sources declined to be identified as the information on bank hiring is not public. Vancouver-based Teck last year said it would move forward with its $4.7 billion Quebrada Blanca phase two copper project in Chile. First production is targeted for 2021 and forecast to reach 316,000 tonnes of copper equivalent per year for the first five full years of mine life. The company last month said it would cut staff and defer some planned capital projects to cope with economic uncertainty that has weighed on commodity prices."

3.56730641731421," Barclays cautions on profit targets despite third quarter trading boost LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Barclays BARC.L said a worsening global economic outlook means it may be hard to meet its profit targets, despite reporting better-than-expected results at its under-pressure investment bank in the third quarter. The bank said it is on track to meet its 9% return on equity goal for 2019, but that the economic environment means achieving its 10% target next year will be tougher. “We acknowledge that the outlook for next year is unquestionably more challenging now than it appeared a year ago, in particular given the uncertainty around the UK economy and the interest rate environment,” Chief Executive Jes Staley said. Barclays reported profit before tax of 1.8 billion pounds ($2.31 billion) for the July-September quarter, above analyst forecasts of 1.5 billion pounds, though those figures excluded a previously announced provision against insurance mis-selling. Barclays shares rose nearly 3% in early trading, to their highest level since November 2018. The lender also said it had agreed with regulators to account its risk-weighted assets more in line with British peers, resulting in an increase in its target core capital ratio to 13.5%. The figure stood at 13.4% at the end of the quarter, below the new target, but Barclays stuck with its earlier guidance that it would triple its 3 pence interim dividend for the year-end payout. The bank’s overall profits were marred by a 1.4 billion pound provision to compensate customers mis-sold payment protection insurance (PPI), in the middle of the 1.2-1.6 billion pound range the bank had forecast. Staley told reporters that the hit had constrained the bank’s plans to return even more cash to investors, such as through buybacks. “I think not just us but everyone on the street missed the avalanche of PPI claims in August, we were not expecting a provision of 1.4 billion pounds and you can imagine our capital position if we hadn’t had that,” Staley said. The bank said it was still wading through more than two million claims or requests for PPI information at the end of the third quarter and could not be certain the provision it had taken would be final, saying it would have a better idea at the end of the year. John Cronin, banking analyst at Goodbody, said the raised capital target would further limit Barclays’ ability to increase payouts to shareholders. While Barclays blamed the global economy and interest rates for its tougher outlook, many of its problems stem from longer-term pressures on the investment banking industry including high pay and falling income as technology slashes trading commissions. Barclays said it was facing a tough market in retail banking in Britain, including a competitive mortgage market and risk-averse consumers taking out less credit hitting its revenue and margins. The British bank has faced calls over the last year and a half from activist investor Edward Bramson to pare back its investment bank, which consistently produces weaker returns than its retail and credit card businesses. CEO Staley pointed to the strong trading performance as vindication of his strategy, as the lender tries to take on Wall Street while European peers are retreating. Profits at its investment bank rose 67% in the third quarter compared to a year earlier, boosted by a 19% increase in fixed income, currencies and commodities trading and an impressive 5% increase in equities revenue where peers have struggled recently."

6.257370305745025," Under pressure, Barclays restores UK post office cash withdrawals LONDON (Reuters) - Barclays BARC.L on Thursday said it will maintain customers' ability to withdraw cash from Britain's Post Office branches, reversing a change announced earlier this month that angered the public and lawmakers amid cuts to the lender's branch network. The bank’s U-turn followed a week that had seen lawmakers summon the lender’s executives to explain the move and widespread criticism from customer lobby groups who said it would especially hurt customers in rural areas. In common with other British banks, Barclays has closed hundreds of branches in recent years, leaving many in more remote towns and villages without access to a branch where cash can be withdrawn without incurring charges. The bank had said customers would not be hurt by branch closures because they could take money out for free from one of Britain’s 11,500 Post Offices as part of a partnership - but then said that would stop in January. “Ultimately we have been persuaded to rethink our proposals by the argument that our full participation in the Post Office Banking Framework is crucial at this point to the viability of the Post Office network,” Barclays Chief Executive Jes Staley said. The British lender reports third quarter earnings on Friday. “I’m glad Barclays have come to this decision. They have listened to concerns of politicians, charities and most importantly their customers,” said Natalie Ceeney, independent chair of the Access to Cash Review lobby group. “Barclays have finally read the writing on the wall and caved to public and political pressure to dump this woefully misguided policy,” added lawmaker Rachel Reeves."
8.830546902825423," A sham Qatar deal could have cost ex Barclays exec $64 million, court hears LONDON (Reuters) - A former top Barclays BARC.L executive, on trial in London on fraud charges, would have risked a 50 million pound ($64 million) ""good leaver"" package if he had sought a criminal deal with Qatar during the credit crisis, a court heard on Thursday. It would have been “lunacy” for Roger Jenkins, one of three men charged with fraud over undisclosed payments to Qatar during emergency fundraisings in 2008, to risk such accrued benefits and a job that had paid him 38 million pounds in 2007 alone, his lawyer told a jury at the Old Bailey criminal court. The high-profile Serious Fraud Office (SFO) case revolves around how Barclays -- one of the few major British banks to survive the credit crisis without direct government aid -- raised more than 11 billion pounds ($14 billion) from Qatar and other investors to avert a state bailout as markets roiled. Prosecutors allege that former top executives lied to the market and other investors by not properly disclosing 322 million pounds paid to Qatar, disguised as “bogus” advisory services agreements (ASAs), in return for around four billion pounds in two fundraisings over 2008. Jenkins, the former head of the bank’s Middle East business, Tom Kalaris, who ran the wealth division and Richard Boath, a former head of European financial institutions, deny charges of conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation and fraud by false representation. Lawyers for Jenkins and Kalaris told the jury the case against their clients was misconceived, perverse and illogical and that there was no evidence the ASAs were a sham or fake. In brief opening speeches before the prosecution continues laying out its case, they alleged the defendants believed the ASAs were genuine agreements to secure lucrative business for Barclays in the Middle East -- a region it was keen to exploit. They said the agreements were side deals during emergency fundraising that June and October that had been approved by internal and external lawyers and cleared by the board. “The unequivocal, repeated advice was that this was legitimate - providing the ASA was a genuine contract for the provision of benefits to Barclays,” said John Kelsey-Fry, a senior lawyer representing Jenkins. Jenkins, who will give evidence later, had pursued and won the trust of Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani, the former prime minister of Qatar, and wanted to unseat Credit Suisse as the wealthy, gas-rich Gulf state’s preferred bankers, the jury heard. Had Jenkins considered a fraudulent deal with Sheikh Hamad, the sheikh might have rung up Barclays bosses and said: “Neither I nor QIA (the sovereign wealth fund) are putting a penny in a bank like yours. I will never do business with you again,” Kelsey-Fry said. Qatar Holding, part of QIA, invested in Barclays alongside Challenger, Sheikh Hamad’s investment vehicle. The case against Kalaris, meanwhile, hung on three conversations he had with Boath on the afternoon of June 11, 2008, that the prosecution had “fundamentally misunderstood”, his lawyer Ian Winter said. When Kalaris told Boath: “Noone wants to go to jail here” and that lawyers would provide “air cover”, he was trying to ensure that a genuine ASA would be approved by legal experts as a legitimate means of paying Qatar for real value, Winter said. All three men, aged between 60 and 64, are charged over the June fundraising. Jenkins, alone, also faces charges over the October fundraising. The trial is scheduled to last around five months."

36.142865820143065," Former Barclays bankers lied about Qatari fees in 2008, fraud trial hears LONDON (Reuters) - Three former Barclays BARC.L executives lied to the market by hiding 322 million pounds ($395 million) in extra fees that the bank paid Qatar in return for vital funding during the global credit crisis, a prosecutor told a London court on Tuesday. The case, one of the most high-profile brought by the UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO), revolves around undisclosed payments to Qatar as Barclays raised more than 11 billion pounds from investors in 2008 to avert a state bailout. Opening the case for the prosecution, Edward Brown alleged that Roger Jenkins, Tom Kalaris and Richard Boath pretended commissions paid to Qatar in 2008 were fees for separate, commercially valuable advisory services agreements (ASAs). “Telling lies in this way, say the prosecution, is a criminal offence,” Brown told the jury at London’s Old Bailey criminal court in a trial scheduled to last up to five months. “It is committing fraud by false representations. They acted dishonestly, say the prosecution, in order to preserve the future of the bank and to preserve their own positions.” The men, aged between 60 and 64, deny wrongdoing. The case hinges on what Barclays told the market in public documents, such as the prospectuses and subscription agreements that outlined the fees and commissions that the bank paid to investors, including former Qatari prime minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani. Brown alleged that Barclays swept aside established banking practices of telling the truth in public documents about the terms on which investors were backing the bank as the credit crunch roiled markets, in order to secure around four billion pounds of investment from wealthy Qatar over 2008. He alleged that the defendants used a “carefully contrived mechanism” to hide the additional fees with two Advisory Service Agreements that were not genuine, but a dishonest way of paying the Qataris extra and hiding the fees from the wider world. The men sat impassively in the narrow, raised glass-surrounded dock. The seven-year case is a rare example of a criminal prosecution of senior bankers at a global bank over conduct during the credit crunch more than a decade ago - and a high stakes trial for the SFO. Jenkins is the former chairman of investment banking in the Middle East and north Africa, Kalaris headed the bank’s wealth division at the time and Richard Boath was the investment bank division’s head of corporate finance in EMEA. Jenkins, 64, Kalaris, 63, and 60-year-old Boath are each charged with substantive fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation. The three men each face both charges over the June capital raising, which include an allegation they conspired with former finance director Chris Lucas to make dishonest representations in public documents for profit or to expose others to loss. Jenkins also faces both charges over the second fundraising four months later. Lucas has not been charged because he is too ill to stand trial, the jury was told. Qatar, a major investor in Britain, has not been accused of wrongdoing."
36.142865820143065," Barclays withdrawal from post offices a concern: regulator LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's regulator for payments systems said it was concerned that Barclays BARC.L has pulled out of an agreement that allows customers of banks to withdraw cash from post offices for free. Lawmakers have piled pressure on banks to maintain their free-to-use cash machine network as fewer people use branches and opt to bank online and pay for purchases by card. Post offices have sought to plug gaps created by banks closing cash machines in rural areas in particular. Last year, Britain’s 11,500 Post Office branches handled more than 130 million transactions for UK banks. “This step by Barclays reduces the number of places their customers can go to get cash,” the Payment Systems Regulator (PSR) said in a statement on Tuesday. “We are concerned about the impact this will have, and we will be closely monitoring the steps Barclays plan to take to make sure there are suitable alternatives for its customers to access their cash - especially those who rely on cash or who live in rural areas.” Barclays said cash withdrawals at post office counters will end in January but it has increased funding for the Post Office so customers and businesses can still pay in cash, cheques and check balances. Barclays said it would not close branches in remote areas, or where it is the last bank in town, for the next two years. The PSR said it welcomed news from the Post Office on Tuesday that the rest of Britain’s banks will continue to offer full banking services to their customers through post offices. Britain’s largest cash machine (ATM) network that allows banks to offer customers access to cash is operated by LINK. The regulator said it may use its powers to ensure that LINK’s public commitments regarding the use of post offices and the availability of free-to-use cash machines are being met. Consumer campaign group Which? said last month that poorer areas were the worst affected by the loss of free-to-use cash machines. One in 10 of Britain’s free-to-use cash machines either closed or started charging a fee over the past 17 months, while more than a third of bank branches have shut within the past five years, Which? said."

33.755272649692714," Former top Barclays bankers face fraud trial over 2008 Qatar rescue LONDON (Reuters) - Three former Barclays BARC.L executives face a London jury in a high-profile criminal trial over how the British bank secured billions of pounds from Qatari investors and averted a taxpayer-funded bailout during the global financial crises in 2008. Roger Jenkins, a former chairman of investment banking in the Middle East; Tom Kalaris, who headed the wealth division at the time; and Richard Boath, who led the European corporate finance business, are charged with fraud offences in a trial scheduled to begin next week and last up to five months. The men deny wrongdoing. The case is a rare example of a criminal prosecution of senior bankers at a global bank over conduct during the credit crunch more than a decade ago - and a high stakes trial for the UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO), which is prosecuting the case. The taxpayer-funded SFO defied its critics, who have accused it of failing to pursue top executives and companies, by criminally charging Barclays Plc and four senior bankers in 2017, one month after the ruling Conservative Party pledged to roll the agency into a broader crime-fighting force. But the ambitious, seven-year case, for which the investigator and prosecutor have received millions of pounds in extra government funding, has proved tricky. Former Barclays chief executive John Varley, once the highest-ranking defendant in the case, was acquitted in June after judges ruled there was insufficient evidence against him. The SFO’s criminal proceedings against the bank were also dismissed by a court last year. Varley and Barclays had each denied wrongdoing. The case revolves around undisclosed payments to Qatar as Barclays raised more than 11 billion pounds ($13.5 billion) from investors in two cash injections in June and October 2008, allowing the bank to become one of the few major British banks to survive the credit crisis without direct government aid. It hinges on what the bank told the market in public documents, such as the prospectuses and subscription agreements that outlined the fees and commissions that Barclays paid to investors, including former Qatari prime minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday said the civil settlement resolves charges that the British bank’s hiring practices in the region, including China, Hong Kong and South Korea, violated the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Without admitting or denying wrongdoing, Barclays agreed to pay a $1.5 million civil fine, plus $4.8 million of disgorgement and interest. A bank spokesman, Mark Lane, declined to comment. According to the SEC, Barclays hired 117 people between April 2009 and August 2013 who had been referred by or connected to government officials or non-government clients, and placed them in permanent jobs, its graduate program, its formal internship program or an unofficial “work experience program.” The SEC said Barclays lacked internal controls to ensure that its employees were not engaged in bribery with respect to these “relationship hires.” It also said some Barclays employees falsified records to conceal who was requesting specific hires and the reasons for those requests. Settlement papers describe several hires, including in Sept. 2011 when a Barclays banker in Hong Kong told colleagues that a senior executive at a private Korean bank would guarantee business “as a quid pro quo” if he could find the executive’s daughter a job. The SEC announced the Barclays settlement nearly three years after JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N agreed in November 2016 to pay $264 million to settle U.S. regulatory charges into its hiring practices in China, known as the Sons and Daughters program."

29.022984882680024," Lloyds and Barclays hit by $4 billion insurance mis-selling claims LONDON (Reuters) - Lloyds LLOY.L and Barclays BARC.L on Monday said a surge in late claims could see them pay out around $2 billion more each to settle Britain's costliest consumer banking scandal, the mis-selling of payment protection insurance (PPI). Lloyds on Monday said it will set aside up to an extra 1.8 billion pounds ($2.2 billion) to settle PPI claims, while Barclays BARC.L later said it would set aside between 1.2 billion pounds and 1.6 billion pounds. Lloyds also said it was suspending its 2019 share buyback program. The huge provisions show how banks in Britain are still battling with the legacy of the scandal, even after the Aug. 29 deadline for consumers to complain, as a rush of customer enquiries in the run-up to that date forced them to set aside more compensation money. PPI policies were sold alongside a personal loan or mortgage to cover repayments if borrowers fell ill or lost jobs, but many were unsuitable. Britain’s High Court in 2011 ruled that consumers could retroactively seek compensation for mis-sold policies. The subsequent rush of claims has been a boon for consumers, egged on by a rise in so-called claims management companies, with lenders having paid out more than 36 billion pounds in total and the final tally expected to top 50 billion pounds. RBS RBS.L said last week it faced additional costs of up to 900 million pounds, while Clydesdale Bank made a fresh 300-450 million pound provision. As Britain’s biggest domestic lender, Lloyds has been the most exposed to PPI and has already paid out more than 20 billion pounds. Lloyds said on Monday it had received 600,000-800,000 requests for information about PPI per week in August, well above its expectations of around 190,000 per week. As a result, it expects to set aside a further 1.2-1.8 billion pounds in its third quarter results to cover payouts. Lloyds also said it had received a claim submitted by the Insolvency Service’s Official Receiver on behalf of bankrupt consumers, pushing costs higher. It added the charge would dent its profitability and it scrapped guidance for a return on tangible equity of around 12% this year. It also warned the increase in its capital ratio in 2019 would be below its 170-200 basis points per annum guidance. Barclays said it still aims to hold its core capital level at its 13% target by year-end. Lloyds made PPI provisions worth 650 million pounds in the first half of this year, meaning the total combined cost for 2019 could hit as much as 2.45 billion pounds, equivalent to 41% of its 6 billion pounds pretax profit last year. The bank set aside 750 million pounds for PPI in 2018. Analysts at broker KBW said the top end of the Lloyds charge at 1.8 billion pounds was marginally better than their worst case scenario, while the Barclays provision was higher than the 700 million pounds they had predicted. Lloyds was given some breathing space on capital in May, when regulators reduced its required core capital ratio to 12.5% from 13%, equating to around 1 billion pounds. Lloyds is continuing to target paying a dividend and said it would make a decision on surplus capital at the end of the year."

New York-based Bramson has made no public statements on his Barclays plans since the bank’s annual investor meeting in May where he conceded he had failed to sway enough shareholders to his position. He told reporters on the sidelines of that meeting that he disagreed with giving the bank’s board more time to improve the investment bank’s returns. Barclays executives have been buoyed by robust performance at its investment bank relative to its European peers in recent quarters, although the unit still makes lower returns than its consumer and credit card businesses. In results for the first six months of this year, Sherborne C reported a slim profit of 1.2 million pounds, helped by a 3.5 million pound windfall from Barclays dividend payments. Sherborne has made huge losses overall since first disclosing its position in Barclays last year as the bank’s share price has fallen, reporting a 219 million pound loss for 2018.

31.873119625175654," Barclays ends partnership with cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase: sources LONDON (Reuters) - Barclays BARC.L is no longer providing banking services to major cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters, ending a relationship that started in March last year as the exchange expanded in Europe. The rare deal between the San Francisco-based exchange and the British bank made it easier for Coinbase users to buy cryptocurrencies with pounds and withdraw their funds. Barclays declined to comment, while Coinbase did not respond to repeated requests for comment. The news was first reported by industry website CoinDesk on Wednesday. Large global banks have been reluctant to do business with companies that handle bitcoin and other digital coins because of concerns they are used by criminals to launder money and that regulators will soon crack down on them. Three-quarters of cryptocurrency businesses in Britain are forced to bank overseas due to the difficulty of getting banking services onshore, a survey by industry body CryptoUK reported last month. Even crypto-related firms that don’t handle digital coins, such as web designers, typically face problems in opening bank accounts, CryptoUK chair Iqbal Gandham told Reuters. The association itself could not get an account with a major UK bank, he said. The challenges lead to extra operational costs and often force British firms to seek accounts overseas, Iqbal said, adding the industry was unclear on what steps it needed to take in order to get easier access to banking. “We have got this traditional industry sitting there, and saying they are not interested,” he said. “We need to sit down and ask what do they want, what are they waiting for?” Coinbase’s chief executive for the UK, which is its biggest European market, said in March 2018 the deal with Barclays had taken some time to sign because the bank needed to be sure that Coinbase had the right systems in place to prevent money laundering.

19.742291052082845," Barclays hikes dividend 20% and targets highest yearly payout since 2008 (This August 1 story is refiled to amend capitalization of Tradeweb in paragraph 17.) LONDON (Reuters) - Barclays BARC.L raised its interim dividend by 20% on Thursday thanks to a more resilient performance at its trading unit and an absence of regulatory fines that have blighted past earnings. The British lender unveiled a 3 pence per share payout and said it expected to treble the distribution over the full year, in a sign of confidence in its ability to improve returns from its consumer and corporate lending businesses. “We are accumulating capital at a very strong rate and we feel good about that,” Chief Executive Jes Staley said, adding that a 9 pence full-year dividend would be the highest payout to Barclays shareholders since 2008. The robust investment banking performance, however, was marred by lower than expected half-year profits in UK retail and business lending, which were down 11% on the previous year, excluding one-off costs. Analysts also said Barclays was compensating for weaker income and higher costs by ramping up the dividend payments. Barclays blamed the income fall on squeezed margins resulting from intense competition in Britain’s mortgage market and decisions to take less risk in its credit card business. The UK unit’s net interest margin – a measure of underlying profitability – fell to 3.11% from 3.24% the previous year, while its return on tangible equity dropped to 15.1% from 17.3%. Group pretax profit dropped to 1.58 billion pounds, in line with forecasts, from 1.9 billion a year ago. Barclays shares rose 2.5% against a 1.5% gain in the FTSE 350 banks index FTNMX8350. Barclays’ transatlantic lending strategy has been overshadowed since early 2018 by a debate about the performance of its investment bank sparked by activist investor Edward Bramson. Bramson’s bid to gain a board seat was defeated in a May shareholder vote but the New York-based financier, who controls a 5.5% stake, has said he will continue to agitate for cuts to the lender’s trading unit. Staley has instead doubled down on Barclays’ investment banking strategy, including a fresh push into securitization and a gradual revival of its mothballed Asian advisory business. Barclays also said it expected full-year costs to come in at less than 13.6 billion pounds, below the minimum threshold it previously said it was targeting for 2019. It has cut around 3,000 roles in the second quarter and said the positive financial impact of the cuts would be felt in its fiscal second half. Barclays’ results follow another tough quarter for its Wall Street rivals, which earlier this month reported falling trading revenues as investors spooked by geopolitical tensions pared activities and steered clear of fresh bets. The bank reported a 25% rise in second-quarter income in its fixed income, currencies and commodity trading division, largely thanks to a 166 million pound gain related to the listing of Tradeweb TW.O. Income from its equities business fell 14% and banking advisory fees were down 1%, reflecting cuts in the industry’s fee pool, the bank said."

Barclays reported profits of 3 billion pounds ($3.64 billion) for the first six months of the year, and said it would increase its interim dividend payment by 20% to 3 pence per share in a sign of confidence in its ability to improve returns. Barclays also said it expected full year costs to come in at less than 13.6 billion pounds, below the minimum threshold it previously said it was targeting for 2019.

14.805647081683809," Barclays, JP Morgan among banks facing UK class action over forex-rigging LONDON (Reuters) - Barclays BARC.L, JP Morgan JPM.N, RBS RBS.L, UBS and Citigroup C.N are being sued by investors over allegations they rigged the global foreign exchange market, in a test of U.S.-style class actions in Britain. The claim, estimated to be worth more than 1 billion pounds ($1.24 billion), was filed at the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) on Monday, U.S. law firm Scott + Scott said. JP Morgan, RBS, UBS, Barclays and Citi declined to comment. Some of the world’s biggest investment banks have already paid more than a combined $11 billion in fines to settle U.S., British and European regulatory allegations that traders rigged the currency markets. Litigators have long hoped to replicate in Britain the success of U.S. class action claims against banks, including Goldman Sachs GS.N, HSBC HSBA.L and Barclays, that have resulted $2.3 billion in settlements for big investors. In May the European Union fined five banks a combined 1.07 billion euros ($1.19 billion) for forex rigging through cartels of traders known as “Essex Express” and “Three Way Banana Split”. The lawsuit is being led by Michael O’Higgins, the former chairman of British watchdog the Pensions Regulator, and is being funded by litigation finance group Therium. O’Higgins told Reuters the total value of the claim would depend on the number of forex trades executed in London for UK-domiciled units - which will be automatically included in the action - and the proportional impact of rate rigging on these. Given the size of London’s forex market, O’Higgins said the total value would likely exceed a billion pounds. “Even on a relatively conservative assumption it’s certainly a billion pounds and possibly several,” O’Higgins said. “Markets should be fair as well as free and in this case the markets weren’t fair.” The “massive” action is a “perfect” case to be brought as a so-called opt-out collective class action for breaches of UK or European Union competition law, David Scott told Reuters. “It is a very difficult case to put together individual damages which are significant enough,” the Scott + Scott lawyer added. Britain’s Consumer Rights Act (CRA) in 2015 introduced “opt-out” class actions for breaches of British or EU competition law. In such cases, UK-based members of a defined group will automatically be bound into a legal action unless they opt out, saving on hefty advertising costs. Overseas-based claimants, however, will still have to actively sign up. The regime is designed to offer a more effective route to compensation for consumers and businesses who fall victim to anti-competitive conduct and is overseen by the CAT. Its first major test case -- a 14 billion pound claim against Mastercard for allegedly overcharging more than 45 million people in Britain over a 16-year period -- was blocked by the CAT in 2017, a decision that was overturned at the Court of Appeal and is set to be heard by the Supreme Court. This wrangling has already delayed other class actions and some law firms have chosen a different legal route for offering pension funds, asset managers and other institutional investors the chance to hold banks to account. Law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan in December filed a damages claim against six banks through London’s commercial courts, which it said has already signed up some of the biggest institutional investors.

After its victory over activist shareholder Edward Bramson who failed in his bid to dismantle the British lender’s trading operations, Barclays is trying to build up its business serving hedge funds. Barclays declined to comment. Germany’s flagship lender said on July 7 that it will axe its equities trading business as part of a major restructuring, and that BNP Paribas had signed a preliminary deal to serve prime finance and electronic equities clients impacted by the plan. However, some of Deutsche Bank’s clients are weighing alternatives to shifting their business over to the French bank, the sources familiar with the matter said. “It is not unexpected and perfectly natural that some clients may wish to move balances to other providers as a temporary measure while our discussions with BNP Paribas are ongoing,” a spokesman for Deutsche Bank told Reuters. “Our discussions with BNP Paribas are progressing well and we are confident that balances will move back once the deal has been completed.” The $20 billion worth of client business in Barclays’ sights includes around $10 billion with one client with whom it already has a relationship, and who has decided to shift its activities to the British bank following news of Deutsche Bank’s planned exit from equities trading, one of the sources said.

The rules were designed to make it easier for small businesses to switch bank accounts and access particular financial products. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said Barclays had admitted that it had not complied with the rules but has since taken steps to fix the issue, such as changing terms and conditions and allowing businesses to switch. “We’ve been working closely with the CMA and have corrected a mistake we made which affected a small number of business customers. We’ve taken steps to ensure that this does not happen again,” a Barclays spokesperson said in an email. Barclays will pay about 2,000 pounds ($2,515.00) in total compensation across affected business premium account holders to reimburse them for payments they should not have had to make, the CMA said. The CMA also said it had asked Barclays to appoint an independent body to audit the bank’s compliance with rules on the treatment of business customers. Eight banks including AIB, Bank of Ireland, Barclays, Clydesdale CYBGC.L, HSBC HSBA.L, Lloyds LLOY.L, Danske Bank DANSKE.CO and RBS RBS.L are prohibited from bundling products. “The Undertakings are clear that banks must not force small businesses to have current accounts with them, as part of a practice known as bundling,” CMA Senior Director Adam Land said. Lenders approved more than 290,000 loans and overdrafts to SMEs across Britain and Northern Ireland in 2018, offering aggregate borrowing facilities worth 28 billion pounds, UK Finance said.

1.5225998699290075," Ex-Barclays CEO Varley cleared of fraud charges LONDON (Reuters) - Former Barclays CEO John Varley was acquitted of fraud charges on Friday after senior judges said there was insufficient evidence against him in a case about Qatari cash injections that saved the bank from a state bailout in 2008. The case, pursued by Britain’s Serious Fraud Office (SFO), was the first time the head of a global bank has faced criminal charges over conduct during the financial crisis, when the banking system was brought to its knees and taxpayers were forced to pay billions of pounds to shore it up. SFO prosecutors had charged Varley with two counts of conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation, alleging he plotted to pay Qatar secret fees to help rescue Barclays, one of the few major British banks to survive the credit crisis without direct government aid. But judges at the Court of Appeal in London agreed with a lower court’s ruling that the SFO’s evidence against Varley, who had denied wrongdoing, was insufficient to proceed with the case. Three other former Barclays executives charged alongside Varley are to be retried at a date yet to be determined. Prosecutors alleged the four men misled shareholders and other investors by not disclosing that the bank paid an extra 322 million pounds to Qatar during a two-part 11 billion pound ($14 billion) emergency fundraising in June and October 2008. Roger Jenkins, the former Barclays chairman of investment management in the Middle East, ex-wealth management head Tom Kalaris and Richard Boath, who headed the corporate finance business, also deny any wrongdoing. The case is seen as a major test of the SFO, which has been investigating the events leading up to Qatar’s investment since 2012, and has faced criticism over its difficulties in holding senior bankers to account. The taxpayer-funded investigator and prosecutor won praise from some politicians and lawyers in 2017 for filing criminal fraud charges against Barclays itself and the senior executives after a five-year investigation. But Varley’s acquittal follows a separate court decision to also dismiss the charges against the bank in 2018. Varley, an Oxford-educated former lawyer, stood down as Barclays CEO in 2011 and has spent most of the years since embroiled in the SFO probe. He joined the bank in 1982, and after 12 years in investment banking, going on to head its asset management division and retail banking. He became finance director in 2000 and was promoted to CEO in 2004. He stood down in 2011 when investment banker Bob Diamond took over."

-2.569188600130548," Mexico's peso may benefit from expected U.S. rate cut: Barclays MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The Mexican peso could strengthen in the coming months and close the year at 18.50 per dollar thanks in part to an expected cut in U.S. interest rates, Barclays forecast on Tuesday. Marco Oviedo, the bank’s top analyst for Mexico, told a news conference he expected the U.S. Federal Reserve to cut its benchmark lending rate later this year while the Bank of Mexico (Banxico) would likely keep interest rates on hold for now. “If the Fed cuts rates and Banxico holds, I’d expect to see the exchange rate at 18.50 at the end of this year,” he said. Looser monetary policy could make U.S. government bonds less attractive to yield-hungry investors and help counteract nervousness in the markets about threats from President Donald Trump to place tariffs on Mexican goods. The Barclays projection would imply a 3.3% strengthening of the peso, which last week sank to a 2019 low after Trump vowed to impose a 5% tariff on all goods imported from Mexico unless its government did more to slow the flow of Central American migrants toward the United States. The peso traded at 19.1330 to the dollar on Tuesday, having bounced back after Mexico and the United States inked an immigration deal on Friday that calls on Mexico to reinforce its southern border with Guatemala. “I would hope that this is not a recurring issue, given that it is a migratory issue, not a commercial one,” Oviedo told Reuters. The markets expect two U.S. rate cuts before the end of the year. Mexico’s benchmark rate is expected to continue at 8.25 percent for a prolonged period. Oviedo said risks facing the peso include the possibility that other ratings agencies will join Fitch in taking a dimmer view on the outlook for Mexico. Fitch last week downgraded Mexico’s sovereign credit rating and that of state oil firm Pemex."

-10.744516039432318," A decade after the crash, Barclays bets again on bundling U.S. home loans LONDON (Reuters) - Ten years on from the global financial crisis caused by a crash in bonds tied to U.S. home loans, Britain’s Barclays is betting a return to that market can bring in bumper revenues to fortify its investment bank. After the crisis, banks initially shunned the business of selling and trading slices of loans tied to residential property, autos or commercial real estate, as such securitizations were demonized for their role in the crash. But now Barclays is preparing to make its comeback, having assembled a team of over 140 securitization bankers and traders with plans to hire more as investors clamor for the higher returns such deals offer compared with traditional stocks and bonds. Having pared back its securitization business in recent years amid a wider restructuring, Barclays’ head of global markets Stephen Dainton said the time was right for the British bank to re-enter the market in force. “This was a 500 million pound ($632.80 million) business for Barclays in terms of revenues last year, when global peers are making 1 billion pounds a year, so for us to get to 500 million pounds additional revenue over 3 years or 100-150 million pounds a year should be achievable at measured pace”, he said. The success of that bid would be a huge fillip for Barclays Chief Executive Jes Staley, who is in a race against time to increase investment banking profits and vindicate his faith in a business that an activist investor argues should be cut back. Barclays’ push is led by veteran securitized assets trader Scott Eichel, who had ringside seats to the highs and lows of the mortgage-backed securities market at Bear Stearns in the run-up to the 2008 crash, and Royal Bank of Scotland afterwards. Now head of securitized products for Barclays, Eichel has assembled a team of 144 bankers and traders who package up and sell everything from commercial and residential home loans to more esoteric assets such as media and sports franchise rights. “The market has changed both outside and inside banks, both from a regulatory perspective and best practises inside firms,” Eichel said. “When you dissect the revenues, those years around the crisis were very heavily trading based, whereas now you are back to the banking model where about 80 percent of your revenues are coming from financing and origination.” That means banks are primarily making money from the intended purpose of securitizations- providing companies and homeowners improved access to credit by pooling the risk of lending to them- rather than making bets on the market. Barclays’ return to the market is a bold gambit given it paid $2 billion in March last year to settle a U.S. probe into its alleged mis-selling of the mortgage-backed bonds that helped to trigger the 2008 crash. The biggest attempt by a British bank to tap into the U.S. securitization market since that crisis is already showing signs of progress. Barclays ranks sixth for sales of U.S. securitizations this year, up two places from the same period a year ago according to Refinitiv data. Only Credit Suisse in third place, is ahead of Barclays among European banks in the U.S. market which is the world’s biggest for securitizations. Deutsche Bank ranks ninth. Barclays is also third overall for underwriting asset-backed securities in the United States, up one place from a year ago, according to the data and again behind top-ranked Credit Suisse. Barclays is hopeful signs of softening U.S. regulations underpinning the securitization industry could help to consolidate and expand its burgeoning market share, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. A report by the U.S. Treasury in October 2017 prompted by an executive order from President Donald Trump backed the view that post-crisis regulation of the sector went too far. “The result has been to dampen the attractiveness of securitization, potentially cutting off or raising the cost of credit to thousands of corporate and retail consumers,” the report said. It recommended loosening the capital requirements for banks underwriting securitizations. Barclays plans to increase slowly the team under Eichel to around 177 bankers and traders, targeting not just the United States but also Europe where there is an active market for securitizing assets, including underperforming and capital intensive real estate loans bloating many banks’ balance sheets. “We’re doing what regulators want banks to do, which is help customers to get financing so businesses can grow, and help investors who buy those bonds to get the liquidity they need,” Eichel said."

-14.169575114231622," Rebel Bramson defeated in bid for board seat to reform Barclays LONDON (Reuters) - Activist investor Edward Bramson lost his battle for a seat on the board at Barclays after shareholders voted against his bid to overhaul the under-fire investment bank from within. Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of the lender’s annual meeting on Thursday, the activist said fellow investors had been swayed by personal appeals from Barclays’ incoming Chairman Nigel Higgins for the opportunity to resolve the investment bank’s long-standing problems. Bramson said his investment fund Sherborne Investors disagreed with giving the bank more time, arguing that he had seen little change at Barclays before the last six weeks, following the surprise exit of investment bank boss Tim Throsby in March. New York-based Bramson has been sparring with Barclays for more than a year over his plans to shrink the lender’s investment bank to improve its lackluster returns. But only 12.8 percent of votes cast voted in favor of Bramson’s resolution, equal to 3.9 percent of the bank’s shareholders, excluding the Sherborne stake. The result indicates broader confidence in Chief Executive Jes Staley’s plan to boost the bank’s fortunes by prioritizing growth in the investment bank. Staley’s strategy has included a costly hiring spree of rainmakers and a diversion of capital from Barclays’ retail arm towards higher risk lending and trading activity. Bramson said there was “an option” to keep Barclays’ investment bank but only if it could become a worthwhile asset for investors. Shares in the lender, which have fallen more than 20 percent in the past year -- more than double the losses suffered by rivals including Royal Bank of Scotland, Lloyds Banking Group and HSBC -- were trading 0.8 percent higher by 1430 GMT. One institutional investor, who voted in favor of Bramson’s resolution, warned Barclays against celebrating his defeat too soon, particularly in view of first quarter figures which showed a drop in investment banking business returns to 9.5 percent from 13.2 percent a year ago. “Defeat looked inevitable but he is in for the long haul. Given the price of Sherborne, he has to keep going,” referring to the fund’s 2018 net asset value, down to 468.7 million pounds from 695.9 million pounds in 2017. Addressing shareholders, Barclays’ departing Chairman John McFarlane said the board unanimously rejected Bramson’s resolution, which it believed would destabilize the bank. “We’ve had a full 12 months of clean and respectable profits, producing earnings per share of 20 pence. When I joined, we were loss-making and dividends were paid from reserves. We’ve firmly drawn a line on the past,” McFarlane said. But not everyone was convinced. “I never expected to be standing here with a share price so badly kicked in,” said a second shareholder, who did not give their name. “I’ve been heavily invested in Barclays my whole life, painfully invested. It’s not good enough,” he added. Barclays was also targeted by a group of climate change protesters, calling for an end to its financing of fossil fuel projects, both inside and outside the venue. Around 15-20 campaigners from groups including student activist network People & Planet gathered outside the meeting. Some waved banners reading ‘Fossil Banks-No Thanks’, days after environmental group Extinction Rebellion paralyzed parts of the British capital in protests against the impact of climate change. Several protesters were dragged away from the QEII conference center in Westminster by police and security staff, while seven or eight students who had gained entry to the auditorium disrupted Staley’s announcement of a new climate change policy. “Tell the truth,” the protesters demanded, before being escorted out of the room. Barclays provided the most financing among European banks for fossil fuel-related projects in 2018 and the sixth highest among lenders worldwide, according to a report by campaigning organization BankTrack."

The named plaintiff, Ellen Christensen of Lawrence, Massachusetts, had argued that Barclays waived its right to arbitration by making use of the courts to sue her, but U.S. District Judge Allison Burroughs on Tuesday rejected that argument. Christensen succeeded in getting Barclays’ debt collection lawsuit against her dismissed, and she will not suffer unfair prejudice if the current case is sent to arbitration, the judge said.

-10.864496909561606," Former Barclays trader claims bank fired him for misconduct after whistleblowing LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Barclays allegedly pressured a former senior trader in the United States to ignore internal risk controls and then forced him out when he raised complaints, according to a public court document seen by Reuters, the latest in a string of allegations about the British bank’s handling of whistleblowers. Brian La Belle, the bank’s former head of commercial real estate trading, alleged his bosses compelled him to perform trades and contact clients in August and December 2017 while he was on mandatory leave, contrary to regulations. He also alleges in the court filing that managers called him to complain that he had raised concerns in emails about being made to work during ‘block leave’, a period of absence required by regulators to ensure bosses can detect rogue trading and other potential misconduct. When La Belle raised concerns with compliance officials at the bank he was first sidelined before he was sacked in Aug. 2018, he alleged in New York district court filing dated April 29. A spokeswoman for Barclays declined to comment, citing a policy of not commenting on ongoing legal proceedings. La Belle’s alleged ousting came at a time when the bank’s handling of whistleblowers was under intense scrutiny after its Chief Executive Jes Staley was in May 2018 fined by British regulators for attempting to unmask one in contravention of rules designed to protect them. The 1.1 million pound ($1.4 million) fine ordered by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Bank of England’s Prudential Regulation Authority was the first such punishment imposed on a sitting CEO of a major British bank. It cast a pall over Staley’s efforts to show the bank has improved its culture since the 2008 crisis. Barclays launched a review of its whistleblowing procedures in 2017, and in its 2018 annual report published in February this year it said it had implemented recommendations from the review including creating a centralized team to review all complaints. After La Belle complained internally about being asked to complete trades while he was supposed to be on leave, he said that Larry Kravetz, one of his managers, asked him on a phone call: “How could you be so fucking stupid to put that in an email.” Kravetz could not immediately be reached for comment. La Belle said he raised further complaints about separate deals that he said were too risky but were pushed through nonetheless, before the bank ultimately fired him. He is seeking reinstatement and over $10 million in compensation. The case continues in New York on Tuesday."

New York-based Bramson’s Sherborne Investors and the board of the British bank have been sparring for months over Barclays’ strategy. Bramson wants to scale back Barclays’ investment bank to reduce risk and boost shareholder returns. Barclays Chief Executive Jes Staley remains staunchly committed to growing the business out of trouble. After failing to persuade Staley to change course since he began building a 5.5 percent stake in the bank in March last year, Bramson hopes a board seat will rachet up the pressure. Both sides have written to shareholders pitching their case and Bramson has courted investors in one-on-one meetings, although none have publicly backed him yet. Interviews by Reuters with five institutional investors in Barclays suggest Bramson has failed to persuade them. Sherborne declined to comment. Mirza Baig, head of investment stewardship at top-40 shareholder Aviva Investors, said Bramson was welcome on the bank’s register but the boardroom was a step too far. “He has created a lot of value at other businesses, but, generally, when he has come in as executive chair and taken full control. This would be a different case where he would just be one lone voice on the board,” he said. A second Barclays shareholder said he backed Bramson’s goal of improving returns but via an “evolutionary” approach. “If you look at banks that have tried to restructure their operations in investment banking - you look at Natwest Markets, Deutsche Bank - I struggle to think of an example where a roughshod restructuring has been accretive to shareholder value.” A third, top-30 investor said he had been impressed by incoming Chairman Nigel Higgins’ grasp of the challenge in hand, and felt investors would give him time. “Management know they have to execute and deliver improved returns... will continue to re-shape the board but obviously he didn’t feel that having someone with a diametrically opposed view on it would be helpful.” A fourth, top-30 investor agreed: “We voted for the chairman to come in and it would be crazy to allow an activist to join the board (at this time).” Jupiter Fund Management, the 24th largest investor, said it also planned to vote against Bramson. Barclays has nearly 500 institutional shareholders, Refinitiv data showed. Since Staley joined Barclays in 2015, the investment bank returns relative to capital invested have increased but are still underperforming the overall business. Barclays’ first-quarter figures showed the investment bank posted a 6 percent drop in income from its markets business and a 17 percent fall in banking advisory fees. Returns in the investment bank fell to 9.5 percent from 13.2 percent a year ago. Famed for successful campaigns against smaller British companies in sectors from chemicals to advertising, Bramson’s board seat pitch has been rebuffed by shareholder advisory firms. Institutional Shareholder Services, the world’s biggest, said Bramson’s proposal “falls short of what can reasonably be expected from a shareholder trying to address issues at a 28 billion pounds, systemically important bank”. Glass Lewis also flagged concern about Bramson’s lack of banking experience and “questionable” shareholding structure, referring to Sherborne’s use of derivative contracts to hedge losses should its strategy fail. Critics said the arrangement meant his interests are not truly aligned with those of other long-term shareholders. British advisory firm Pirc, however, said it recommended that investors abstain in the vote on Bramson’s proposal as a challenge to the board to do better in the year ahead - or face a similar contest in 2020."

-5.3204372726889355," Barclays to exit British gas fracking industry LONDON (Reuters) - Barclays said it is exiting the British gas fracking industry after gas developer Third Energy, in which the bank owns a significant stake, agreed to sell its onshore gas activities to a division of U.S.-based Alpha Energy. Third Energy had planned to frack at the Kirby Misperton site in Yorkshire, northern England, last year but failed to receive government consent after a crack down on the financial status of fracking firms. Third Energy Holding Limited said on Thursday it had signed a sale agreement with Alpha Energy owned York Energy UK Holdings Ltd, for its onshore business, including Kirby Misperton. “The deal confirms that we no longer have the stake in the fracking site”, a Barclays spokesman said via email, adding that the bank had planned to offload the stake for some time. Fracking, or hydraulically fracturing, involves extracting gas from rocks by breaking them up with water and chemicals at high pressure. It is fiercely opposed by environmentalists who have raised concerns about potential groundwater contamination and say extracting more fossil fuel is at odds with Britain’s commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Cuadrilla, the only company to have fracked for gas in Britain, had to halt operations several times last year at its Preston New Road site in northwest England due to seismic events. Alpha Energy is a U.S.-based oil and gas asset business. The sale is subject to regulator conditions being met, a statement from Third Energy said."
-5.3204372726889355," Britain's Barclays hit by struggling investment bank, flags cost cuts LONDON (Reuters) - Profit at Barclays fell 10 percent in the first quarter as its under-pressure investment bank struggled with tough markets, prompting it to signal further cost cuts if these conditions persist. The poor investment banking performance comes at an awkward time for chief executive Jes Staley, who is locked in a public battle with activist investor Edward Bramson who wants to see the unit pared back to boost overall returns at Barclays. Barclays said on Thursday returns in the investment banking business fell to 9.5 percent from 13.2 percent a year ago, while its overall profit was 1.54 billion pounds ($1.99 billion). Although this was in line with the 1.57 billion forecast compiled from the average estimates of 13 analysts polled by the bank, shares in Barclays were down 1.43 percent at 0730 GMT. “Despite a better than expected result in fixed income trading, today’s numbers will do little to take the pressure from activist Edward Bramson off the board,” said Nicholas Hyett, analyst at one of Britain’s biggest online investment platforms, Hargreaves Lansdown. Barclays said that if the tough market conditions persist, it may have to cut annual costs in 2019 below the 13.6 billion to 13.9 billion pound range it earlier said it expected. The bank said measures it took three years ago to ensure bonus pools in a given year are better aligned with that year’s performance, mean it has more discretion to cut bonuses when performance dips. “What you see in the first quarter is Barclays using this discretion around variable compensation to manage our costs and deliver expected profitability,” Staley said. Staley last month ousted his lieutenant Tim Throsby, a fellow former JP Morgan banker who he had recruited in September 2016 to run the investment bank and who then embarked on a hiring spree in a bid to restore morale and performance. Barclays said income from its equities business fell 21 percent and banking advisory fees were down 17 percent, although earnings from fixed income, currencies and commodity trading (FICC) rose 4 percent. The drop in equities income follows similar announcements from U.S. rivals such as Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan which saw first quarter declines in trading revenues as client activity slumped. Barclays’ core capital ratio fell to 13 percent from 13.2 percent at the end of the previous quarter, and its total income of 5.25 billion pounds fell short of analysts’ expectations."

Barclays, which is facing calls from activist investor Edward Bramson to streamline its investment banking business, saw return on equity in the international unit that houses the investment bank increase to 10.6 percent from 8.7 percent at the end of 2018.

-7.916192140670303," End to Iran sanction waivers only bullish for oil prices in short term: Barclays (Reuters) - The U.S. push to reduce Iranian oil exports to zero will tighten crude markets significantly in the short term, but is unlikely to have a big effect on prices over a longer period, Barclays said in a note on Monday. Washington this week demanded that buyers of Iranian oil stop purchases by May 1 or face sanctions, a move to choke off Tehran’s oil revenues that sent crude prices to six-month highs on fears of a potential supply crunch. [O/R] “The announcement implies material upside risk to our current $70 per barrel average price forecast for Brent this year, compared with the year-to-date average of $65 per barrel,” the British bank said. “But (it) does not affect our view on longer-term prices materially.” While Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and other members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will likely fill the gap in supply created in the wake of tighter U.S. sanctions, the bank expects Riyadh to be slower to adjust than it was when crimping production late last year. Barclays also said that the U.S. move increased the risk of conflict in the Middle East, including the potential closure of the strategic Strait of Hormuz. The response of Iran’s biggest oil customers, China and India, will also be key as both could find it hard to completely wean themselves off supplies from the Middle Eastern nation, Barclays said."

-10.857138191762163," Barclays and Red Kite settle copper market dispute LONDON, April 18 (Reuters) - British bank Barclays and hedge fund Red Kite Group have settled a legal dispute in which the fund accused the bank of manipulating the copper market and causing it to lose money. “Legal proceedings between the Red Kite group as Claimants and Barclays Bank PLC as Defendant have been concluded on mutually acceptable terms,” Barclays said in a statement on Thursday, without giving details of the settlement. Red Kite in 2017 sued Barclays for $850 million, alleging in court documents that the bank’s proprietary traders were able to see the hedge fund’s confidential trading positions on the London Metal Exchange (LME) that were being executed by another division of Barclays. As a result, Barclays traders executed trades based on that inside knowledge which resulted in profits for Barclays but damaged Red Kite’s interests, the fund alleged at the time. Barclays denied that its traders were able to access Red Kite’s confidential information. The bank declined to comment further on Thursday, saying the terms were confidential.

Both camps have begun a back-and-forth courting of shareholders ahead of the bank’s May 2 annual general meeting as Bramson attempts to muscle in on decision-making at the company and push through his proposal for a strategic overhaul of Barclays investment bank. After both issued statements last week laying out their case, New York-based Bramson again wrote to investors on Monday to say nothing Barclays had said had made him change his view about what needed to change at the bank. “In our firm’s professional opinion, the stubbornly low valuation that the market accords to the shares of Barclays will continue until the board finally adopts a strategy that is more realistic and shareholder orientated,” Bramson said. Barclays said last week that it plans to stick to its efforts to improve performance at the investment bank rather than scale it back in size. Given that, Bramson reiterated his call to join the board. “Our public investment record shows that we have consistently assisted boards, that were initially reluctant, to deliver major increases in value for all of the shareholders,” Bramson said. “We believe that, given mutual goodwill, and some change in perspective, Barclays offers similar opportunities.” However, Barclays’ defense against the activist received a boost over the weekend after shareholder advisory group Glass Lewis recommended investors vote against Bramson’s bid to join the board. While Glass Lewis said the activist’s arguments had some merit, with shareholders getting “fairly mediocre returns”, it none the less took a dim view of the motion. “We ultimately believe support for Sherborne’s proposal would entail considerably greater risk and uncertainty and, based on available disclosure, would be predicated on substantially unknown strategic intentions,” the advisory group said."

In response to a letter sent by Bramson’s Sherborne investment vehicle to shareholders on April 8, Barclays said the activist investor would have “a disruptive and uncollaborative influence on the board”. The British bank also questioned Bramson’s banking experience, arguing that he does not have the right skills and he is not aligned with the wider shareholder base. The lender said Bramson’s letter showed he had “a preconceived viewpoint and a poor understanding” of Barclays and its corporate and investment bank (CIB). It added that Bramson’s analysis of the under-pressure CIB unit was based on a “flawed understanding of complex banking organizations”. Bramson, 68, has built a Barclays stake of roughly 5.5 percent but has so far failed in attempts to get the lender to scale back its investment banking activities. Bramson says these have weighed on shareholder returns and could result in the bank being forced to raise fresh capital. Barclays, however, said it does not need another strategic overhaul, adding that it is already taking action to improve performance without “the unnecessary distraction” of having Bramson on the board. Barclays Chairman John McFarlane said shareholders need to “appreciate how damaging this could be.” Bramson and Sherborne Investors could not be reached for immediate comment. McFarlane also said Barclays had no plans to commit significantly more financial resources to its corporate and investment bank and that urgent work was taking place to bring returns to required levels.

Judge Robert Jay told the jury at Southwark Crown Court on Monday he was required to discharge them. No further details could be published due to continued reporting restrictions. Former chief executive John Varley, Roger Jenkins, Tom Kalaris and Richard Boath are charged with conspiring to commit fraud by false representation when Barclays raised more than 11 billion pounds ($14 billion) from investors in 2008, allowing the British bank to avoid a state bailout. Prosecutors allege the bankers excluded from public documents and hid from other investors around 322 million pounds in fees paid to the Qatari investors through so-called advisory service agreements (ASAs). The defendants deny wrongdoing and said they had relied on legal advice. The prosecution, brought by the UK Serious Fraud Office, is the first jury trial of a leading bank’s CEO over conduct during the financial crisis. Qatari investors ploughed around 4 billion pounds into Barclays during two fund raisings in June and October 2008."

-7.581243371233272," Ex-Barclays bankers jailed in Britain for rigging Euribor LONDON (Reuters) - Two former Barclays bankers were sentenced on Monday to a total of nine years in jail after they were convicted by a London jury of conspiring to rig the Euribor global interest rate benchmark. Colin Bermingham, 62, a British former cash market expert and senior rate submitter, was sentenced to five years while Anglo-Italian Carlo Palombo, a 40-year-old former derivatives trader, received a four-year term. A “devastated” Palombo and his family needed time to come to terms with the decision while considering any appeal, his lawyer John Hartley, of Hodge Jones & Allen, said in an email, while Bermingham’s legal team had no immediate comment. Bermingham and Palombo had both denied any wrongdoing. Sisse Bohart, a Danish junior Barclays trader and submitter, 41, was acquitted last week. The three had faced a re-trial after a previous jury was last year unable to reach a verdict. The men were convicted by a jury at Southwark Crown Court in the sixth rate-rigging prosecution brought by the UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO) after a near seven year criminal investigation. It is the second re-trial after a hung jury, underlining the tricky nature of the financial fraud cases. Prosecutors alleged the defendants conspired to defraud by dishonestly manipulating Euribor (the euro interbank offered rate) - a benchmark that helps determine rates on an estimated $150 trillion to $180 trillion of financial contracts and loans worldwide - between January 2005 and December 2009. Eleven banks and brokerages have been fined a total of $9 billion to settle rate-rigging allegations in a global investigation. Barclays paid a $453 million penalty in 2012, sparking a backlash that forced out former CEO Bob Diamond, the British fraud inquiry and an overhaul of rate-setting rules. The sentences are a welcome fillip for the SFO, which has prosecuted five men and one woman over Euribor rigging to date and secured four convictions, including former Deutsche Bank star trader Christian Bittar and one-time Barclays trader Phillipe Moryoussef in 2018. “These men deliberately undermined the integrity of the financial system to line their pockets and advance the interests of their employers,” said Lisa Osofsky, the head of the SFO. “We are committed to tracking down and bringing to justice those who defraud others and abuse the system.” Bittar, one of the world’s best-paid traders who earned more than 57 million pounds ($74 million) over the indictment period, was sentenced to five years and four months after pleading guilty. Moryoussef, tried in absentia after fleeing to France when Bittar’s plea was made public, was handed an eight-year term. He remains in France. Prosecutors said that traders cheated counterparties by requesting rates from colleagues that would benefit their trading positions - and that submitters then entered false or misleading numbers by nudging them up or down accordingly. Brussels-based Euribor, like its Libor (London interbank offered rate) counterpart, is designed to reflect the cost of borrowing between banks and is set after submitters at a panel of major banks report their estimated costs of borrowing over various periods to an administrator, who calculates an average. Palombo, who joined the bank in his early twenties, said he had been trained by Moryoussef and had thought it “perfectly legitimate practice” to ask submitters for preferential rates until Barclays banned the practice in 2009 as a U.S. inquiry into rate-rigging allegations gathered steam. Bermingham, who joined Barclays at 18, said he did not believe he had ever submitted a rate that was not justified by real flows of cash in the money market. He said he had not known that Moryoussef sometimes made rate requests on Bittar’s behalf but would have reported this, because Deutsche Bank was a rival. Nine men have been convicted and 10 acquitted in London over rate-rigging to date. The SFO says other lines of enquiry in the investigation remain open."

The jury of nine men and three women on Thursday found Colin Bermingham, a 62-year-old veteran banker, guilty by a majority verdict after a two-month re-trial brought by the UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO) at Southwark Crown Court. Bermingham, the last of three former Barclays bankers to hear his verdict in the case, bowed his head in the dock and his supporters gasped in shock in the public gallery. Just hours before, the jury had been in deadlock. Co-defendant Carlo Palombo, a 40-year-old Anglo-Italian former derivatives trader, was convicted by a majority verdict on Tuesday while Sisse Bohart, a 41-year-old Dane, was acquitted. She was not in court to hear her verdict. Bermingham and Palombo will be sentenced next Monday. In the glass-surrounded dock, a composed Bermingham had placed a comforting hand on Palombo’s back when the former trader-turned-academic, visibly shaken, turned to gaze at his distraught, heavily-pregnant wife in the public gallery after he heard his verdict earlier this week. Bermingham, Palombo and Bohart were tried twice after a previous jury was unable to reach a verdict in their case last July. Eleven powerful banks and brokerages have been fined a total of $9 billion to settle rate-rigging allegations in a global investigation. Barclays paid a $453 million penalty in 2012, sparking a backlash that forced out former CEO Bob Diamond. The defendants denied a charge that they had conspired to dishonestly manipulate Euribor (the euro interbank offered rate) - a benchmark that helps determine rates on more than $150 trillion of global financial contracts and loans - between 2005 and 2009. Prosecutors alleged that bankers tilted the odds in their favor for profit, tweaking rates to gain a dishonest trading advantage, deliberately ignoring rules that rates should be set independently of commercial interests and prejudicing the economic interest of others. The jury was told that two French bankers, former Barclays colleague Philippe Moryoussef and Christian Bittar, a one-time Deutsche Bank star trader, had already been convicted over the conspiracy. Bittar, once one of the world’s best-paid traders, pleaded guilty ahead of last year’s trial, at which a jury convicted Moryoussef. But he was tried in absentia and remains in France after fleeing when Bittar’s plea was made public. The jury was asked whether Palombo, who joined Barclays as a graduate trainee and reported to Moryoussef, Bohart, a junior trader and rate submitter and her boss, 38-year Barclays veteran Bermingham, had been knowingly involved in the same conspiracy. The former bankers denied dishonesty. They said they had followed instructions and learnt on the job, had acted openly, believed there was a range of equally justifiable rates, that taking account of a bank’s commercial interest was common market practice - and that Euribor rates accounted for an insignificant part of their jobs. The verdicts represent a mixed result for the taxpayer-funded SFO in a complex case. The agency’s original plans to prosecute 11 individuals were hampered when Germany and France refused to extradite five. Brussels-based Euribor, like its Libor (London interbank offered rate) counterpart, is designed to reflect the cost of borrowing between banks and is set after submitters at a panel of major banks report their estimated costs of borrowing over various periods to an administrator, who calculates an average.

-7.533401885899497," Barclays CEO Staley grabs control of investment bank, ousts Throsby LONDON (Reuters) - Barclays chief executive Jes Staley took direct control of its under-pressure investment bank on Wednesday, ousting the head of the business Tim Throsby in a surprise shake-up as he battles an activist investor. Staley is assuming oversight of the three Corporate and Investment Bank (CIB) divisions, banking, markets and corporate bank, in a move he said would help improve overall returns to more than the 7 percent achieved in 2018. “We need a more granular execution focus on the businesses within the CIB if we are to drive those returns, in a reasonable timeframe, towards and above that cost of capital,” said Staley. The Barclays CEO faces pressure from activist investor Edward Bramson, who is seeking a seat on the board of the bank to try and force it to shrink the underperforming investment banking business that Staley has championed. A Barclays spokesman said Throsby’s departure was “not linked in any way” to the pressure from Bramson’s Sherborne investment vehicle, which holds a 5.5 percent stake in the bank. Barclays hired Throsby, who like Staley came from JP Morgan, in September 2016 after a six-month search for the vital job overseeing the bank’s trading and advisory businesses. Throsby then made senior hirings as Barclays struggled to improve returns at the unit, which have consistently lagged its more profitable retail banking and credit card businesses. The return on tangible equity of 7 percent achieved by Barclays’ investment bank in 2018 was a step up from the previous year, but still well short of its cost of capital and below the longer-term goal of 10 percent. As part of the management shake-up, Joe McGrath will run the global banking unit, Stephen Dainton will be interim head of global markets pending a search for a full time appointment, and Alistair Currie will run the corporate bank, Barclays said. In addition, the head of Barclays’ UK bank business Ashok Vaswani will take on a new role as global head of consumer banking and payments, bringing its profitable Barclaycard business and private bank under his control."

-9.02613410136983," UK fraud office failed to get key Qatar documents for Barclays trial LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s Serious Fraud Office (SFO) failed to take “reasonable and appropriate” steps to get key documents from Qatar’s U.S. lawyers before a fraud trial of four former Barclays executives, a London criminal court heard on Thursday. The jury was told that Judge Robert Jay had ruled in January on the SFO’s failure to obtain the documents from Latham & Watkins, before the start of the landmark court case against former Barclays CEO John Varley and former senior colleagues: Roger Jenkins, Tom Kalaris and Richard Boath. The men are on trial over side deals struck by the British bank when it raised more than 11 billion pounds ($14.5 billion) from investors, including Qatar, to stave off a state bailout in June and October 2008 at the height of the credit crisis. Prosecutors allege the men, who are charged with conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation, misled shareholders and other investors by not disclosing that Barclays paid an extra 322 million pounds to Qatar through advisory service agreements (ASAs) that were not genuine. The men deny wrongdoing. In documents shown to the court during the prosecution’s case, they say they relied on legal advice at the time. Boath, the only defendant to answer SFO questions in 2014 and 2016 that went beyond a prepared statement, was told the agreements were legal as long as Qatar provided valuable services, according to extracts of interview transcripts shown to the court. He said he was confident that Jenkins, who had the relationship with Qatar, would deliver, the court heard. The flagship SFO case marks the first criminal charges filed in Britain against such senior bankers over credit crisis-era conduct. The trial has offered a rare glimpse into how Barclays battled to avoid state control by clinching a rescue deal with Qatar over a decade ago. Qatar Holding, part of the Qatar Investment Authority sovereign wealth fund, and Challenger, an investment vehicle of former Qatari prime minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani, invested around 4.0 billion pounds in Barclays in two capital raisings in June and October 2008. In so-called “agreed facts” between prosecutors and the defense read out by the prosecution, the jury at Southwark Crown Court was told that the SFO had not interviewed or investigated either Qatari party. The judge had also noted that although documents held by Qatar’s lawyers Latham & Watkins were probably covered by legal privilege, the SFO had had options to try and obtain them, the jury heard. SFO investigator David Webb told the jury on Thursday it had taken 18 months to two-years to get “essential” documents from Barclays that the bank originally said were privileged - confidential advice by lawyers for clients - before it waived privilege. The judge asked Webb if he had asked Boath whether the former director knew that the ASA was never intended to provide genuine services. “I don’t know,” he said. “If I did say that it would be on the transcript.” Prosecutors have now closed their case, marking the formal half-way stage in the trial. The judge dismissed the jury until April 1 to allow for lengthy “discussions of law” to begin, he said."
-11.252891363882627," Former Barclays executive felt sick over 2008 Qatar deal, court hears (Editor’s note: paragraph 2 contains language that readers may find offensive) LONDON (Reuters) - A former Barclays executive told in-house lawyers he felt sick when he was told the bank could be challenged by criminal authorities over side deals with Qatar during a 2008 emergency fundraising, a London fraud trial heard on Wednesday. Richard Boath, in the dock at Southwark Crown Court with former Barclays CEO John Varley and former senior colleagues Roger Jenkins and Tom Kalaris, told investigators in 2016 he also thought Qatar should have been told to “fuck off” when it demanded additional fees when helping bail the bank out. The four men are charged with conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation over how they secured a two-part, 11 billion pound-plus ($14 billion) capital raising as the bank scrambled to avoid a state bailout during the financial crisis. The Serious Fraud Office (SFO), which is prosecuting the case, alleges the defendants misled shareholders and other investors by not disclosing that Barclays paid an extra 322 million pounds to Qatar through advisory service agreements (ASAs), which the SFO says were not genuine. The men deny wrongdoing. Extracts of transcripts of telephone conversations and emails were read out and shown to the court by the prosecution on Wednesday. Former in-house Barclays lawyer Judith Shepherd told Boath on June 18, 2008, that the bank had to show it had received valuable services from Qatar in return for the ASA - or risk other investors, the market regulator and criminal authorities viewing them as disguised commissions for the capital raising. “I’m already feeling sick. There’s no need to use all those words to make me feel sicker,” Boath responded in the telephone call, according to one transcript. Eight years later, Boath told SFO investigators that although he had not liked the Qatar deal, it had been negotiated by his seniors, approved by lawyers and that he thought the bank believed it would get value for the money. “The lawyers persuaded themselves that even though they knew that the ASA in June was a consequence, a response to the request from the Qataris for additional fees, it didn’t matter as long as we got value for services,” Boath, the bank’s former head of European financial institutions group, told the SFO, according to interview transcripts read out to court. Boath said that Jenkins, who was negotiating with the Gulf state, had “real heft” in Qatar and was a “big deal down there”. “I believed Roger would get his pound of flesh,” he said, according to the transcripts. “I don’t think (former finance director) Chris Lucas or John Varley would ever have signed off on it if they thought that they were not going to get value for their services,” he added in a recorded interview that was played to the court. Asked by the SFO investigator if the ASA in June 2008 was a disguised commission, Boath replied: “No. The advisory service agreement was put in place by Barclays in exchange for services that they expected Roger to get value for.” “Judith goes on to say: ‘Well, Big Dog will be in the dock first’,” the SFO investigator noted in the 2016 interview. “Yeah, that’s Roger, by the way,” Boath said in the recorded SFO interview. Lucas has not been charged because he is too unwell to stand trial, the jury has been told. Shepherd, the Barclays lawyer, and Qatar have not been accused of any wrongdoing."

The acquittal of Robert Bogucki, who led Barclays’ foreign exchange trading desk in New York, by U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer in San Francisco sets back federal efforts to hold senior bankers and traders criminally responsible for suspected misconduct. It also marks a rare instance of such a case being tossed out immediately after the prosecution presented its case at trial, because the evidence was too weak to support a conviction. Bogucki’s trial began on Feb. 21. A spokesman for U.S. Attorney David Anderson in San Francisco said that office was reviewing Breyer’s decision. “We are so very pleased that the court recognized Mr. Bogucki’s innocence and affirmed that the government’s attempt to rewrite the rules years after the fact runs counter to core constitutional principles of due process,” Sean Hecker, a lawyer for Bogucki, said in a statement. Bogucki was charged with “front-running” a 2011 transaction involving the sale of 6 billion pounds of cable options linked to HP’s purchase of British software company Autonomy Corp. Prosecutors accused Bogucki of trying to push down the options’ price, enabling Barclays to profit at HP’s expense. An indictment quoted Bogucki warning a trader not to let “some loose lipped market monger” tell HP what they were doing, and the trader discussing their plan to “spank the market.” Breyer, however, said no reasonable jury could find that Bogucki owed HP a duty of trust and confidence. He also said the relationship between Barclays and HP, industry practice and other factors necessitated an acquittal. “The government has pursued a criminal prosecution on the basis of conduct that violated no clear rule or regulation, was not prohibited by the agreements between the parties, and indeed was consistent with the parties’ understanding of the arms-length relationship in which they operated,” Breyer wrote. “The court cannot permit this case to go to the jury on such a basis,” he added. Though such banks as Barclays, Citigroup Inc, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc have pleaded guilty in connection with foreign exchange markets, few individuals have been held criminally liable.

-9.06976897001524," Barclays bosses fretted over Qatar deal in 2008 fundraising LONDON (Reuters) - Top Barclays executives worried that investors in the bank’s 2008 emergency fundraising would go “nuts” if Qatar was given a better deal unfairly, a London court heard on Monday. Richard Boath, one of four former Barclays bosses on trial over fraud charges, told the bank’s former Middle East head Roger Jenkins that they had to be careful to ensure the legality of a plan to pay Qatar extra fees it was demanding in the form of a separate advisory agreement. “We can’t do a capital markets transaction in which we give one set of fees to one set of investors, and a different set of economics for another set of investors because if they found out they’d go nuts,” Boath said he told Jenkins in a recording of a 2014 interview with Britain’s Serious Fraud Office (SFO) played to the jury. An unfairly preferential deal could also have risked trouble for the executives who planned it, Boath said he told Jenkins. “He said well fuck that I am not taking a hit to save John and Bob’s jobs,” Boath reported Jenkins as replying, referring to Barclays’ former chief executive John Varley and former investment banking chief Bob Diamond. The SFO contends that Boath, Jenkins, Varley and former head of wealth management Tom Kalaris misled shareholders and other investors by not disclosing that Barclays paid an extra 322 million pounds ($424 million) to Qatar through so-called “advisory service agreements” (ASAs) at the height of the credit crisis. All four men, the most senior to face a criminal trial over crisis-era conduct, deny wrongdoing. Qatar has not been accused of any misconduct. Diamond is not involved in the trial. The agreements were entirely legal and authorized by the bank’s internal and external lawyers, board and compliance department, Kalaris said last week in a prepared statement read out to the jury by prosecutors. Boath likewise on Monday said in recorded statements played to jurors that, after raising concerns about the ASAs, he became comfortable that they were legal and approved by the relevant authorities within the bank. The prosecution alleges that concerns about the deal expressed by the defendants show they thought or knew what they were doing was wrong. Whereas the bankers say it just shows they were being careful to remain within the rules. China Development bank and Singapore’s Temasek were among the other investors in the eventual deals in 2008 that meant Barclays avoided a state bailout, unlike rivals Lloyds and Royal Bank of Scotland. The trial continues this week."
-12.586606516796806," Ex-Barclays CEO had to delegate responsibility during 2008 fundraising LONDON (Reuters) - John Varley, former CEO of Barclays, told investigators in 2014 he had had to delegate responsibility during the British bank’s efforts to raise more than 11 billion pounds ($15 billion) at the height of the credit crisis. In a prepared statement read out by a lawyer for the Serious Fraud Office prosecutor in a London fraud trial, Varley said he had wanted Barclays to have a strategic relationship with Qatar in 2008 as part of a broader plan to generate 75 percent of income and profit from outside Britain. But Varley said that he had had to place heavy reliance on others to run a bank the size of Barclays, especially during the financial crisis in 2008. “Of necessity, the CEO cannot acquire full visibility nor command the detailed work,” he told investigators, according to the statement read out by the SFO lawyer on Thursday. “There is nothing unusual in such a business model. A large organization would risk cirrhosis if the CEO had to be involved in the detail of every decision,” Varley told investigators, according to the statement read to the court. Varley and former Barclays’ executives Roger Jenkins, Tom Kalaris and Richard Boath are charged with conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation over side deals struck with Qatar during a two-part emergency fundraising that allowed the British bank to avoid a state bailout in 2008. Prosecutors allege the men misled shareholders and other investors by not disclosing that Barclays paid an extra 322 million pounds to Qatar through so-called “advisory service agreements” (ASAs) at the height of the credit crisis. The men, the most senior to face a criminal trial over crisis-era conduct, deny wrongdoing. Varley told the SFO he regarded the ASAs as symbiotic with but not dependent or conditional on the Qatari participation in the capital raising - and that it marked a formalized cooperation with Qatar that would involve new business opportunities for the bank in the region. “I did not regard the fee payable ... as connected to the capital raising from a regulatory perspective. The agreement was distinct and I received no contrary advice,” he was quoted as saying in the statement read to the court. Jenkins, the former chairman of the bank’s Middle East investment banking division, told investigators in 2014 he had relied on legal advice at the time, according to the statement read to the court. Jenkins told SFO officials he had had no responsibility for the bank’s decisions and no authority to agree terms to any deal. He said he relied on instructions and legal advice and had no reason to doubt the legal advice he had been given. “I want to be clear that I did not lead on and was not responsible for Barclays’ decisions to raise capital in June and October 2008,” he was quoted as saying in the statement read out to the court. He said the decision to enter into advisory services agreements with Qatar in June and October 2008 was made by the company board or others in senior management, including Varley and former finance director Chris Lucas. Lucas has not been charged because of serious ill health. Prosecutors, who will continue reading out prepared statements by the defendants, said they were not calling further witnesses in the case. Qatar has not been accused of wrongdoing."

Two capital raisings in June and October 2008 allowed Barclays to avoid a state bailout as markets roiled in the financial crisis over a decade ago. Prosecutors allege the four defendants misled shareholders and other investors by not disclosing that Barclays paid an extra 322 million pounds to Qatar through so-called “advisory service agreements” (ASAs), described as a “mechanism of paying the Qataris what they wanted”. The men, the most senior bankers to face a jury trial over credit crisis-era conduct, deny wrongdoing. Cross-examined by William Boyce, a lawyer for Boath, Leighton agreed that Japan’s Sumitomo and China Development Bank sought Memoranda of Understanding to deepen relationships with Barclays after investing in the bank in June 2008. But such agreements did not lead to preferential prices for any strategic investors during the first of the bank’s two emergency fundraisings in 2008, the court heard. “The Japanese, Chinese, Qataris all wanted extras and the extras were dealt with in different ways without it affecting the level playing field for everyone else,” said Boyce, taking the court through Leighton’s interviews with the SFO and markets regulator in 2014 and 2013. “That’s right,” Leighton responded. Leighton, who was responsible for designing spreadsheets to stress test numbers for the June 2008 transaction, said he had understood that the Qataris had to perform their side of the service agreement, designed to open up fresh business opportunities for Barclays in the Middle East. Leighton told the court that after June capital raising, he traveled to Bahrain to advise an investment fund that had got itself into trouble in the financial crisis and also advised an entity in Kuwait. “Part of our success in winning these transactions came from the fact that we had our own shareholder (Qatar) pushing for Barclays to be involved in those trades,” Leighton said. Boyce put it to Leighton that Barclays’ former head of the investment bank, Bob Diamond, had trumpeted the Qatari ASA to investors when unveiling the capital raising on June 25, 2008, saying it would “sort out our strategy for the whole Middle East”. “This was broadcasting it as loudly as it could because it was so good for the bank,” Boyce said, taking Leighton through testimony he has given to investigators. “That’s right,” Leighton said. Barclays did not publicly disclose that it paid Qatar a 42 million pound fee under the first ASA in June 2008. Four months later, the bank paid Qatar 280 million pounds in a second ASA, the court has heard previously. Varley and Jenkins have been charged with two counts each of fraud by false representation over the two fundraisings in 2008. Kalaris and Boath face one charge each over the June fundraising. The trial continues."
-10.385845332424532," Ex-Barclays sovereign wealth boss says she did not know about Qatar service deal LONDON (Reuters) - A former Barclays manager tasked with building relationships with sovereign wealth funds in 2008 did not know about deals for additional services from Qatar after it invested billions of pounds in the British bank during the credit crisis. The evidence of Gay Huey Evans, a former divisional vice-chairman of investment banking and investment management at Barclays, was read out at London’s Southwark Crown Court on Tuesday during the criminal trial of four former senior executives, including ex-chief executive John Varley. Varley, Roger Jenkins, Tom Kalaris and Richard Boath are charged with conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation in a case that revolves around how Barclays raised more than 11 billion pounds ($14.6 billion) from investors, including Qatar, to stave off a state bailout more than a decade ago. The men, the most senior bankers to face a jury trial over credit crisis-era conduct, deny wrongdoing. Qatar, which invested more than 4 billion pounds in Barclays in 2008, has not been accused of any wrongdoing. Prosecutors for the Serious Fraud Office allege the bankers misled the market, shareholders and other investors by not disclosing around 322 million pounds in extra fees paid to Qatari investors through so-called additional service agreements, described as a “mechanism of paying the Qataris what they wanted”. Huey Evans, a witness for the prosecution who is now deputy chair of the Financial Reporting Council accounting watchdog, started reporting directly to Jenkins around September 2008. In testimony read by prosecutors, Huey Evans said she would have been “pushier” about what services Qatar was providing if she had known about the deal. “I am not aware of any advisory services provided by Qatar apart from the introduction of Sheikh Mansour (of Abu Dhabi) to the October 2008 fund raising,” she was quoted as saying. The court has been told that Qatari investors were paid a separate 66 million pounds for introducing Abu Dhabi’s Sheikh Mansour bin Zayed al-Nahyan to Barclays’ second capital raising in October 2008. Jenkins was the gatekeeper of the Qatari relationship, but with oil prices rising in 2008, Huey Evans’ team hoped to build deeper relationships with oil-rich states and that Jenkins would facilitate introductions. But her department was frustrated at a lack of progress, the court heard. She said that “he (Jenkins) tried to be helpful” but that business in the Middle East was complex. The bank had lacked a close relationship with Abu Dhabi and executives who wanted to meet the Crown Prince could be asked to sit and wait for hours - or days. “No-one liked sitting there,” Huey Evans was quoted as saying. The jury in the trial, which is scheduled to last up to six months, was told the witness testimony could be read out if there were no questions from the defense."
-2.249679592748526," Barclays income boost cheers investors, makes Brexit provision LONDON (Reuters) - Barclays reported a lower than forecast attributable profit of 3.5 billion pounds ($4.56 billion) for 2018, as it set aside cash to cushion against Brexit losses and its trading business weathered a difficult fourth quarter. Barclays did show signs of progress in its under-pressure investment bank, where profit for the full year increased 15 percent to 2.6 billion pounds as its equities trading unit saw income rise 25 percent. The bank’s shares were up 4.3 percent by 0820 GMT. Barclays Chief Executive Jes Staley is locked in a high-profile tussle over the bank’s strategy with activist investor Edward Bramson, who believes the lender should ditch a costly plan to grow its investment bank and focus on other less risky parts of its business. Bramson on Feb. 5 sought to ratchet up pressure on the bank by tabling a resolution that would see him win a board seat, a bid which investors said was unlikely to succeed but which has sharpened focus on the performance of the investment bank. The results gave ammunition to both sides in the debate. Staley could point to the investment bank’s return on tangible equity -- a key measure of profitability -- rising from 2 percent to 7 percent in 2018, close to the overall target of 9 percent for the group in 2019. The bank’s fixed income, currencies and commodities trading business weathered the volatile markets of the fourth quarter better than its Wall Street rivals with revenue down 6 percent compared with double digit falls at Goldman Sachs, Citi and JPMorgan. For critics of the investment banking-led strategy, however, there were signs that other parts of the lender are suffering as profits fell 3 percent in the Barclays UK division. The bank also saw a 20 percent decrease in corporate lending income, which it attributed to resources being deployed to higher-returning business elsewhere. Barclays’ 150 million pound Brexit provision followed similar moves by HSBC and Royal Bank of Scotland in recent days. Barclays said the provision reflected the lesser of two downside economic scenarios, in which growth would slow to 0.3 percent and the country’s unemployment rise to 5.7 percent. Barclays paid a dividend of 6.5 pence per share and signaled intentions to return more capital via dividend increases and buybacks when it was practical to do so. The bank however reported its core capital ratio fell to 13.2 percent from 13.3 percent a year ago, a dip which is likely to renew a debate over its ability to return more capital to shareholders at a time when rivals Lloyds Banking Group and RBS are ramping up payouts. Staley’s total pay package for 2018 fell to 3.36 million pounds, down from 3.87 million pounds the previous year. He was the lowest paid among the four biggest British bank bosses. Including conduct and litigation charges, the bank’s profit of 1.4 billion pounds against a 1.9 billion pounds loss in 2017. Barclays’ International division, which houses its investment bank, reported a profit before tax of 3.9 billion pounds, in line with analysts’ expectations of 3.95 billion pounds."
-2.249679592748526," Breakingviews - Barclays has new ammunition for Bramson fight LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - In the Catholic catechism, a “just war” restores moral order rather than merely exacting revenge. Corporate crusader Edward Bramson has reason for bloodlust given the losses he has sustained since he disclosed a 5 percent stake in Barclays nearly a year ago. But his battle to capture a board seat and cut the investment bank down to size is on shakier ground after a broadly robust fourth quarter. Barclays’ traders rode to Chief Executive Jes Staley’s rescue when he needed them. The bank said on Thursday that fixed income revenue declined by a mere 6 percent in the final three months of 2018, far less than European peers or Wall Street’s average drop of nearly one-fifth. Even so, the division reported an implied loss for the quarter – excluding litigation and fines, the return on tangible equity was minus 0.9 percent. That backs Bramson’s view that the investment bank is hogging resources – it accounted for 55 percent of group risk-weighted assets and 42 percent of group revenue in the fourth quarter – while delivering at best mediocre returns. True, the division improved underlying annual returns: ROTE rose from a dire 2.2 percent in 2017 to a middling 7.1 percent. But that compares with a UK retail lending business which bested that by nearly 10 percentage points. Staley insists investment banking is core to Barclays’ transatlantic corporate lending franchise. But investors don’t ascribe it much value. Barclays’ great UK rival, the retail focused lender Lloyds Banking Group, boasts a market capitalisation that is more than one-and-a-half times bigger than Staley’s bank despite having a much smaller balance sheet. That gives Bramson, who has put himself forward for a board seat at the lender’s annual meeting, plenty to aim at. Cost slippage may be another point of contention: a target of achieving expenses of less than 60 percent of revenue, originally earmarked for this year, has been changed to “over time”. Even so, Staley can still just about hit a 9 percent ROTE target this year, according to a Breakingviews calculation which assumes flat revenue, one-off costs dropping to 580 million pounds, operating costs of 13.7 billion pounds and a 24 percent tax rate. That was enough to send Barclays shares, trading at a hefty 35 percent discount to tangible book, up 5 percent on Friday. Given Bramson’s desire for vengeance, Staley’s victory is only provisional."

-2.042157020213196," Barclays hoped 2008 cash call would drive international growth, court told LONDON (Reuters) - Barclays believed deals with strategic investors during the 2008 financial crisis would help to provide a springboard for its international ambitions, the bank’s former chairman told a London criminal trial on Tuesday. Marcus Agius, called as a prosecution witness in the fraud trial of four former senior colleagues, said the bank had hoped to secure partnerships that would reinforce the bank’s global ambitions by granting Barclays “favored nation status” for future business opportunities with investors such as Qatar. “That was how it was put and that was how the board understood it,” the veteran banker told a packed courtroom. Former Barclays’ chief executive John Varley and three former senior executives Roger Jenkins, Tom Kalaris and Richard Boath, deny conspiring to commit fraud by false representation when the bank raised more than 11 billion pounds ($14 billion) from investors in 2008 to avert a British state bailout. Prosecutor Edward Brown alleges the men did not properly disclose an extra 322 million pounds in fees paid to the Qatari investors through so-called “advisory service agreements” during the financial crisis and that other investors that took part in the two capital raisings - from Abu Dhabi, China, Singapore and Japan - would have expected the same terms. Agius, in a light gray suit, told Southwark Crown Court that in June 2008, Barclays initially thought a deal with Qatar would be desirable, but not essential. But markets became increasingly febrile towards the end of that summer. In October 2008, just four months after an initial capital raising, Barclays turned again to Qatar - and Abu Dhabi - for a second emergency fundraising to stave off state control. Agius said he did not remember frenetic to-ing and fro-ing between the bank’s executives and Qatari investors about fees, but said that the board wanted to avoid the restrictions of a British government sector-wide bailout - and that a deal with investors such as Qatar seemed “sensible”, if complex. Asked if he remembered being told that the Qataris had laughed at Barclays officials, who, according to Oct. 22 board meeting minutes, had offered them 120 million pounds in fees, Agius replied: “No.” The case marks the Serious Fraud Office’s first criminal charges filed in Britain against such senior bankers over financial crisis-era conduct. The trial has charted how the Barclays executives battled to clinch a deal with Qatari investors who made tough demands. Varley described the investors as “new cocks of the roost” in an email to Agius on June 5, 2008, which was shown to the court. Agius said his relationship with Varley was “always excellent” and that he considered him creative and courageous with a formidable work rate. “I regarded him as a man of utmost integrity, high intelligence ... someone committed to see the bank succeed,” he said. Qatar Holding, part of the Qatar Investment Authority sovereign wealth fund, and Challenger, an investment vehicle of former Qatari prime minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani, which invested in Barclays in 2008, have not been accused of wrongdoing. The trial is scheduled to last up to six months."

The lender said about 1,500 of its staff will talk in its branches to businesses attending the events about managing their cashflow, exporting goods, supply chain management and other issues as the March 29 Brexit deadline approaches. Barclays said it will invite about 5,000 business customers to attend the events in the next few weeks. While Britain’s banks have so far reported few signs of businesses being unable to repay loans or otherwise struggling as Brexit looms, in recent weeks some have said uncertainty over access to European markets is stifling decision making. Barclays rival Royal Bank of Scotland on Friday said it faces a possible spike in bad loans from business failures and pressures on its own cost-cutting initiatives. The failure so far of Prime Minister Theresa May to secure backing for a Brexit deal with the EU is harming small businesses, “making it impossible for them to plan, hire and invest,” chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses Mike Cherry said last week."

0.8822258781315175," Barclays says has spent up to 200 million pounds on Brexit DUBLIN (Reuters) - Barclays has spent 100 to 200 million pounds ($129-258 million) moving operations and staff out of Britain to prepare for Brexit, its UK chairman Gerry Grimstone said on Wednesday as bank bosses detailed the costs involved. International banks have been setting up subsidiaries across the European Union since Britain voted to leave the bloc in 2016 to ensure they can continue to serve clients if their operations in London lose the rights to do so from March 29. Barclays has moved its European headquarters and almost 200 billion euros in assets to Dublin and last year began shifting 40 to 50 investment banking jobs to Frankfurt from London. Grimstone detailed Barclays’ costs after Bank of America Vice Chairman Anne Finucane told a banking conference in Dublin that her bank had spent $400 million on its Brexit preparations. “I hate to say that we’re more cost effective than Bank of America. We’ve certainly spent 100, 150 or 200 million,” Grimstone said at Dublin’s annual European Financial Forum. Morgan Stanley’s head of EMEA, Clare Woodman, declined to say how much the bank had spent on its moves to Paris and Frankfurt. Grimstone said Barclays had swiftly moved to take advantage of the new environment. “We identified a couple of years ago that there were huge opportunities for us. We haven’t been dragged kicking and screaming to this,” he said of Barclays’ new Dublin office. It can accommodate a staff of 400 and 1,700 staff around Europe will report to it. “We believe this will give us a competitive advantage on the continent which we haven’t had before,” he said. “At the same time as expanding here, we are expanding our trading presence in Frankfurt and we will use this to be a major force in the euro market and in euro clearing.”"
4.03664360303515," Barclays to shift some credit and equity derivatives sales jobs to Paris: sources LONDON (Reuters) - Barclays is shifting some jobs in its London-based credit and equity derivatives sales teams to Paris as it reorganizes its operations ahead of Brexit, two sources familiar with the matter said. Last month the bank warned staff in charge of credit and equity derivatives sales for the Nordics that their jobs would be relocated to Paris by the end of March, giving them just two months’ notice, one of the sources said. A spokesman for Barclays declined to comment. The likelihood of a no-deal Brexit has increased substantially since British Prime Minister Theresa May’s plan for maintaining ties with the EU was rejected on Jan. 15 by the UK parliament as well as by many politicians in her own Conservative Party. Many financial institutions have started putting Brexit contingency plans into action and moving staff to newly leased offices in Paris, Frankfurt, Dublin and other financial hubs on the continent. Bank of America said on Friday that it had begun relocating some jobs to Paris, with staff moving in to a new 11,000 square meter office in the eighth arrondissement, near the Elysee Palace. The French government has been actively seeking to convince banks to move jobs to Paris, introducing tax incentives and pledging to open more English-language schools for bankers’ children. Barclays has made Ireland its main post-Brexit EU banking hub, and got court approval last week to move 190 billion euros ($215 billion) of assets from Britain to its Dublin subsidiary. A source familiar with the moves said only “a relatively small number of people” would relocate to Paris as well as other EU centers and that decisions had to be fast-tracked after Theresa May’s historic defeat on her Brexit deal in Parliament on Jan. 15. Britain’s financial services industry has so far emerged largely unscathed from the build-up to Brexit, with only about 2,000 roles expected to have moved or been created overseas even as the risk of a disorderly exit grows, a Reuters survey showed. Most bankers remain confident a compromise deal between Britain and the EU will be hammered out. They are waiting to see what will be agreed and what the relationship will be, before making any final decisions about relocations. ($1 = 0.8824 euros)"

Woods was speaking in parliament’s Treasury Select Committee, some of whose members questioned whether Staley’s punishment last year had been tough enough for such a high profile banker. Staley sought to unmask a whistleblower who sent letters criticising an employee of the bank. “I have consistently acknowledged that my personal involvement in this matter was inappropriate, and I have apologised for mistakes which I made,” Staley said in a Barclays statement in May when the fine was announced. Barclays said at the time that the regulators did not allege that Staley acted with a lack of integrity or that he lacked fitness and propriety to continue in his job. “The correct response was the one we gave, a fine and public censure,” Woods said. “That should send a message to everybody that whistleblowing is a live rail that you touch at your risk.” Staley had made a very significant and egregious error and the investigation team from the BoE and the Financial Conduct Authority got to the bottom of what happened, Woods said. Staley should not have intervened in the whistleblowing case unfolding at Barclays, Woods said. Barclays was fined $15 million by the New York State Department of Financial Services for violating banking law in the whistleblowing case, raising the question that American authorities were tougher than their UK counterparts, lawmakers said. Woods said the BoE took the view that the fault lay mainly with an individual and not the bank itself. The case was the UK regulators’ first under a new regime, known as the senior manager regime (SMR), to make top officials at banks and insurers directly accountable for their actions. Woods said while the SMR regime would help enforce “normal” behaviour at banks, it could not stop an individual that wanted to pursue criminal activities and fraud.

3.3619014016743227," Former Barclays bosses hid 322 million pounds in Qatar fees in 2008, court told LONDON (Reuters) - Four former Barclays BARC.L executives conspired to commit fraud by hiding 322 million pounds of payments to Qatar in return for cash injections in 2008, a prosecutor alleged at the opening of one of London's most high-profile criminal trials. Former chief executive John Varley and three former directors are the most senior bankers to be prosecuted in Britain over events during the financial crisis, when Barclays avoided a state bailout by raising more than 11 billion pounds from mainly Gulf investors in two cash calls. Opening the case for the Serious Fraud Office prosecutor, senior lawyer Edward Brown alleged that the bank’s Advisory Service Agreements (ASAs), through which Qatar was paid 322 million pounds ($419.66 million) in 2008, were a “dishonest mechanism” to conceal extra fees from other investors and the wider market. “It is the hiding of these additional commission fees which lies at the heart of this case...,” he told the jury at London’s Southwark Crown Court in a courtroom so packed that reporters had to request tickets to gain entry. “(The ASAs) were devised by the conspirators as mechanism for paying the Qataris greater fees than those paid to other investors so as not to reveal the true position ...,” Brown told the court in a trial scheduled to last up to six months. Varley, 62, in an open-necked shirt and jumper, listened in the glass-surrounded dock, flanked by Roger Jenkins, in a polo neck jumper and jacket, Tom Kalaris and Richard Boath, both wearing suits. They are charged with conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation. Varley and Jenkins face two counts and Kalaris and Boath face one. They all deny the charges. Varley and Jenkins, the 63-year-old former head of Barclays’ Middle Eastern arm, are charged with two counts of conspiring dishonestly with former finance director Christopher Lucas to make misleading or untrue representations in documents published in relation to both the June and October capital raisings. Kalaris, 63, who ran Barclays’ wealth management business, and Boath, a 60-year-old former head of the corporate finance division, face one count over the June 2008 cash call. Both charges allege the men were either seeking to profit or to cause or expose others to losses. Lucas, who is suffering from ill-health, has not been charged. The case hinges on what the bank disclosed in its public statements in 2008; the prospectuses for the capital raisings and subscription agreement documents published that June and October, which outlined fees and commissions paid to investors in return for backing the bank. Prosecutors allege that Barclays thought it essential to secure a deal with Qatar in early 2008 as markets roiled, but that the Gulf state drove a hard bargain. Qatar initially demanded a fee of 3.75 percent before settling on 3.25 percent in return for investing in the bank - more than double what Barclays was paying other investors, the prosecution alleged. Unwilling to risk other investors demanding the same terms - or appearing financially unstable by being seen to pay too high a price - the executives played a part in false representations to the market, the prosecution alleged. Brown said some defendants relied on the fact that lawyers had sanctioned the use of ASAs by signing off on them, as their defense in the case. But he alleged lawyers were told the ASAs were genuinely designed to represent services provided by Qatar and that they were separate from the Qatari investment in Barclays. “The truth is that the lawyers did not approve of the use of the ASAs as mechanisms to hide the commission fees paid to the Qataris,” he said. Qatar, which has not been accused of wrongdoing, plowed around 4.0 billion pounds into Barclays in 2008, Brown said. The trial continues this week. ($1 = 0.7673 pounds)"
5.930275264613095," Barclays weighs 280 redundancies, relocations at Leeds call center LONDON (Reuters) - British bank Barclays BARC.L has warned nearly 300 staff they could face redundancy or relocation from its Millshaw Court call center in Leeds, northern England, following unspecified ""changes to its business"". The FTSE 100 .FTSE lender said it had informed 280 staff at the office that their roles were at risk, with around 115 of the roles possibly relocating to Manchester or Liverpool in northwestern England, and the northeastern English city of Sunderland. Barclays declined to give further reasons for the possible layoffs but British banks have broadly been pursuing deep cost-cutting initiatives in recent years in the face of intensifying competition in UK lending and tighter profit margins. It said the landlord of Millshaw Court had also put the site up for sale with planning permission to be converted into flats. The bank said it would keep the center’s remaining 800-strong workforce informed on a search for an alternative office and said it had secured a three year extension to the lease until November 2021. Separately, employee union Unite said it would oppose the redundancies, calling them “deeply irresponsible” and said it would “significantly damage both the business and the customer experience”."
8.877073564804046," Ex-Barclays trio 'cheated global financial system', Euribor trial told LONDON (Reuters) - Three former Barclays BARC.L bankers cheated the global financial system to gain an unfair edge over counterparties in a five-year plot to rig Euribor interest rates, a London prosecutor alleged on Tuesday. James Waddington, a lawyer for the UK Serious Fraud Office, said the defendants were part of an elite, well-paid group that fixed the odds in a zero-sum game as he opened the prosecution’s case in a criminal trial expected to last at least two months. Colin Bermingham, a 62-year-old Briton, Carlo Palombo, a 39-year-old Anglo-Italian, and 41-year-old Sisse Bohart, a Dane, deny wrongdoing. In London’s sixth rate-rigging trial, the three defendants are accused of conspiracy to defraud by dishonestly manipulating Euribor (the euro interbank offered rate), a Brussels-based benchmark that helps determine rates on more than $150 trillion of global financial contracts and loans, between 2005 and 2009. Waddington said that two other bankers, former Barclays trader Philippe Moryoussef and Christian Bittar, a one-time Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE trader, already stood convicted. “The issue is whether one or more of these defendants ... was also a party to that conspiracy,” he told the 12-person jury at London’s Southwark Crown Court. Euribor, like its Libor (London interbank offered rate) counterpart, is designed to reflect the cost of borrowing between banks and is set after submitters at a panel of major banks report their estimated costs of borrowing over differing periods to an administrator, who calculates an average. Waddington alleged that the three defendants tilted the odds in their favor for profit, tweaked rates to gain a dishonest trading advantage and thought they would not be caught out. Some of the world’s most powerful financial institutions have paid around $9 billion to settle allegations that bankers submitted rates that flattered their own trading books. Barclays was the first of 11 major banks and brokerages to be fined in 2012 following allegations of rate-rigging. The British bank paid a $453 million penalty, sparking a backlash that forced out former chief executive Bob Diamond, an overhaul of rate-setting rules and the British criminal inquiry."
8.574092700523378," Former Barclays bosses face London trial over Qatari cash call LONDON (Reuters) - The most senior bankers to face criminal charges in Britain over conduct during the financial crisis are preparing to appear before a London jury in a trial that will test the mettle of the Serious Fraud Office. Former Barclays BARC.L CEO John Varley and three one-time colleagues stand charged over deals with Qatari investors to secure cash injections that allowed the bank, that can trace its origins back to around 1690, to survive the crisis a decade ago. The trial, that started on Monday and is slated to last for up to four months, is starting with lengthy legal, procedural arguments. Prosecutors are expected to open their case around Jan. 21. Varley, who married into one of the families that helped build Barclays, Roger Jenkins, the one-time chairman of the Middle Eastern banking arm, Tom Kalaris, an American former wealth division CEO and Richard Boath, a former European divisional head, are charged with conspiracy to commit fraud. Lawyers for Boath and Kalaris declined to comment, while legal representatives for the other defendants did not respond to requests for comment. When charges were filed in June 2017, a lawyer for Jenkins said his client would vigorously defend himself against the allegations. Boath said at the time he had no case to answer. Barclays secured around 12 billion pounds ($15 billion) in emergency funds from mainly Gulf investors as markets plunged in 2008, allowing it to avoid the state bailouts taken by rivals Royal Bank of Scotland RBS.L and Lloyds LLOY.L. Qatar Holding - part of the Qatar Investment Authority sovereign wealth fund - and Challenger, an investment vehicle of former Qatari prime minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani, invested about 6 billion pounds in the bank. But the SFO, which prosecutes serious white collar crime, has charged the men over “capital raising arrangements” with Qatar Holding and Challenger in June and October 2008. Qatar, a major investor in Britain, has not been accused of wrongdoing. Lawyers say the performance of the SFO will be under as much scrutiny as that of the well-heeled defendants after a court threw out its separate charges against Barclays over the capital raising - and a judge last month halted its prosecution of former senior Tesco TSCO.L supermarket managers mid-trial. Lisa Osofsky, who took the top job at the agency last August, has stood back from handling the Barclays case because of a potential conflict of interest linked to her previous work. Mark Thompson, who was appointed interim SFO head until Osofsky took up the post, is overseeing the case. The new year has started briskly for the SFO. Its retrial of three former Barclays traders accused of plotting to rig Euribor global interest rates kicks off on Jan. 14. A jury was unable to reach a verdict in their case last year."
16.609772640777066," Barclays rebuffs bid by activist Bramson to gain board seat LONDON, Dec 21 (Reuters) - Barclays has spurned an attempt by activist investor Edward Bramson for his fund to secure a seat on the board of the British bank. Bramson’s approach to gain a board seat was rebuffed in informal discussions between the parties, two sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Friday. The rejection was first reported by Sky News. Bramson’s fund Sherborne Investors has said little in public about its plan to shake up Barclays since it first disclosed in March that it had built a stake of more than 5 percent in the bank. But three people familiar with the matter told Reuters in May that New York-based Bramson was urging the lender to abandon the bulk of its trading activities at its investment bank as part of an overhaul to cut costs and lift returns. Bramson could still push for a board seat by calling an extraordinary general meeting, but it is unclear whether he would have sufficient support from other Barclays shareholders for the move. Bramson has previously used stakes in British firms to engineer changes, including at private equity firm Electra and fund manager F&C. He typically joins the boards of the companies he targets. Sherborne, listed on the London stock market, gave its investors a glimpse of its plan for Barclays in August when the fund said that it was talking to the bank about its capital allocation, quality of earnings, capital adequacy, and cost structure. Bramson’s fund also said it was engaging with Barclays to find a successor to its Chairman John McFarlane. The bank subsequently said in November that Rothschild veteran Nigel Higgins would replace McFarlane in May next year."
13.487082533063335," Barclays promotes 85 in investment bank to managing director LONDON (Reuters) - Barclays has promoted 85 executives in the international division that houses its investment bank to the rank of managing director, the British lender said on Friday. The promotions represent an increase from the 74 elevated last year and 60 in 2016. However, a spokesman for the bank said the net increase in managing directors could be smaller than those figures implied as some executives have also left. The promotions come as Barclays’ investment bank is under scrutiny by investors, amid pressure by activist investor Edward Bramson who sees paring back the trading business as the way to generate better returns for Barclays overall. Barclays Chief Executive Jes Staley has repeatedly rebuffed that notion, saying the investment bank is an important part of Barclays’ strategy that provides a counterbalance as trading revenues rise in turbulent times that hurt other parts of the business. The managing director role is one of the most prestigious in investment banking. Below the chief executive level, most global investment banks are run by just a few hundred ‘MDs’, from whose ranks the next leader of the bank is typically chosen. A typical salary for a managing director at Barclays is about 300,000 pounds ($377,520) according to recruitment website Glassdoor. Of the newly promoted managing directors, 27 percent are women, a spokesman said, up from 23 percent last year and 18 percent in 2016. Barclays said in February it had a mean gender pay gap in its international division of 48 percent, among the highest differentials in financial firms globally. It means the average hourly wage for a woman was just under half that of a man, with the difference generally caused by fewer women attaining senior ranks such as managing director rather than by women being paid less than men of the same rank."
12.15777631707092," Net 2019 euro area bond issuance after ECB buying will be highest since 2014: Barclays LONDON, Dec 6 (Reuters) - New government bond issuance in the euro area next year, when European Central Bank purchases are stripped out, will be at its highest level since 2014 as the central bank prepares to end its asset purchases this month, according to Barclays. The weight of ECB bond purchases to stimulate the euro zone economy since 2015 has meant net bond issuance -- after central bank purchases -- have fallen sharply. But that looks set to change with the ECB winding down stimulus. Barclays estimates net bond issuance in the bloc next year at 185 billion euros ($209.6 billion), 13 billion euros lower than in 2018. But when ECB buying as part of its QE programme ends, this will be the highest supply number in five years. “As a result, market participants are questioning who will be absorbing this EGB (European government bond) net issuance without the support of QE purchases and what the market impact will be,” the bank said in a note published late on Wednesday."
13.068573897230301," Barclays to keep Swiss private banking growth momentum in 2019 ZURICH (Reuters) - Britain's Barclays BARC.L expects to have grown its Swiss private banking business by more than 10 percent this year and is looking to expand further in Switzerland in 2019. Barclays embarked on an international hiring spree across its wealth management division last year, targeting more business from a growing pool of millionaires and billionaires. And the bank is now looking to recruit more relationship managers, product specialists and investment experts in Zurich and Geneva after business in Switzerland grew better than expected in 2018, its Swiss head Gerald Mathieu told Reuters. Barclays, which has around 300 employees across private and investment banking in Switzerland, plans to add six to 10 relationship managers, the money-earners who attract and serve customers in wealth management, in the year ahead. “When you look at the market, there’s a league that starts at 20 billion Swiss francs ($20.1 billion) in assets under management and credits,” Mathieu said, adding that Barclays is now more than three quarters of the way to that mark. “With the progress and momentum we have with clients, Barclays is already well on the way to achieving this goal over a short to medium-term timeframe,” he added. Barclays has carved out a niche among British and Middle Eastern clients looking to book money in Switzerland, and sees room to expand its onshore business for ultra-wealthy expats who are familiar with the bank’s brand and British heritage. “We are able to provide access to our investment and corporate bank, which makes a big difference when meeting ultra high net worth individuals and entrepreneurs,” said Mathieu. The banker, who previously led Barclays’ international private banking out of Monaco, said uncertainty over Brexit could also prove a boost to the Swiss business."
-2.5821660017864074," Barclays not liable to buyers of U.S. IPO before 2008 crisis: appeals court NEW YORK (Reuters) - Barclays Plc BARC.L is not liable to investors who bought its U.S.-listed stock a few months before the 2008 financial crisis and accused the British bank of hiding its risky debt exposure and a capital shortfall, a U.S. court ruled on Monday. In a 3-0 decision, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan upheld the dismissal of claims against Barclays and underwriters led by Citigroup Inc C.N over the British bank's April 2008 sale of $2.5 billion of American depositary shares. Barclays' share price had fallen 80 percent by the following March. The 9-1/2-year-old case is among the last ones accusing big banks of having inflated their share prices by hiding or failing to fix soured credits on their balance sheets before the crisis. Barclays was accused of concealing 21.6 billion pounds (then about US$42 billion) of mortgage-backed securities and other risky assets insured by monoline insurers, and a March 2008 “directive” by the U.K. Financial Services Authority requiring it to raise more equity capital. Barclays might have had a duty to disclose its monoline exposure, but “resoundingly” showed that its omission had little or no impact on its share price, the appeals court said. A regulator’s “expressions of concerns about a bank’s financial status and vigorous requests - even if expressed urgently - to be kept apprised of the bank’s contingency plans” did not qualify as a “directive,” the court ruled. Joseph Daley, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Barclays spokesman Andrew Smith declined to comment. The decision on Monday affirmed a September 2017 ruling by U.S. District Judge Paul Crotty in Manhattan. Crotty said the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc, the bailout of insurer American International Group Inc AIG.N, and capital raisings by other British banks might also have contributed to Barclays' falling share price.

The merger, announced by the banks in September, is the latest consolidation among state-owned companies in the United Arab Emirates’ (UAE) capital. ADCB, majority owned by the Abu Dhabi government and the second largest bank in the emirate after First Abu Dhabi Bank (FAB) FAB.AD, declined to comment. Barclays also declined to comment. If it goes ahead, a merger of the trio could create an entity with around $113 billion in assets, according to Refinitiv data, and the UAE's third-biggest lender after FAB and Emirates NBD ENBD.DU. A separate source said two banks could be created out of the consolidation, with the conventional banking units of ADCB and UNB merging to create one lender. Another could be formed through combining the Islamic banking units of ADCB and UNB, along with Al Hilal. AlKhaleej newspaper reported the same arrangement was being considered last month, citing sources. The tie-up was at an early stage, UAE Central Bank governor Mubarak Rashed al-Mansoori told reporters last week on the sidelines of a conference, adding he expected more consolidation in the future.

-9.518610331725288," Britain's Barclays, Lloyds shock in EU bank stress test LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's Barclays BARC.L and Lloyds LLOY.L were the surprise laggards in a European Union bank health check on Friday, although none of the 48 lenders tested failed a major capital threshold. The EU’s banking watchdog published results on Friday for its toughest “stress test” since 2009, when it began the exercise to identify capital holes and avoid any repeat of the government bailouts triggered by the 2008 financial crisis. The latest test measured banks’ ability to withstand theoretical market shocks like a rise in political uncertainty against a backdrop of plunging economic growth, a disorderly Brexit or a sell-off in government bonds and property. While there was no pass or fail, banks unable to complete the “adverse” or toughest part of the test without preserving a capital ratio of well above 5.5 percent, could be forced by regulators to raise more capital, sell risky assets or curb their dividends. None of the banks tested in the health check by the European Banking Authority dropped below the 5.5 percent threshold, but Barclays and Lloyds unexpectedly came in among the three worst performers. Barclays ended up with a core capital ratio of 6.37 percent and Lloyds with 6.8 percent in the adverse scenario, both marked down due to their exposure to riskier credit, the EBA said. British banks have chased higher-risk business to try and boost returns, as rock-bottom interest rates and competition from upstart rivals fueled a boom in consumer lending. This has prompted repeated warnings from the Bank of England for them to take a more prudent approach. The International monetary Fund said in September that consumer credit in Britain was rising much faster than income and this could require “additional increases in bank-specific capital buffers”. But Britain’s central bank - which will publish the results of its own stress tests of British banks on Dec. 5 - said on Friday the UK lenders tested by EBA showed they could absorb the impact of the worst scenario. The EBA test contained potential shocks like Britain crashing out of the EU next March without a deal. Barclays said in response to the results that it remained comfortable with a target core capital ratio of around 13 percent. Lloyds said its capital levels remained strong and it continued to expect to generate 2 percentage points of additional capital for the full year. Some Italian banks also fared poorly. Banco BPM's BAMI.MI capital result was 6.67 percent, while UBI's UBI.MI was 7.46 percent. Monte dei Paschi di Siena BMPS.MI, which failed the previous round of stress tests in 2016 and has since been bailed out by the state, was not included in the health check this time. Italian banks had been expected to be among the worst performers due to a sharp fall in the value of government bonds since an anti-establishment, eurosceptic government came to power in June. The country’s banks hold some 375 billion euros ($427 billion) of domestic government bonds, and the rise in Italy’s bond yields is eating into their capital and pushing their borrowing costs higher. Germany's largest lender Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE had a ratio of 8.1 percent, the second-worst German score ahead of public-sector bank NordLB but up from 7.8 percent when it was last put under the microscope two years ago. The outcome of the tests showed there was, on average, enough capital in the EU banking system, but challenges like bad loans and lackluster earnings remain, said Mario Quagliariello, the EBA’s director of economic analysis. “Profitability remains quite a problem for many banks in Europe,” he told Reuters. Risks from credit was a common theme across the EU. The EBA said that across the 48 banks tested, the adverse scenario dented the core equity capital ratio by 395 basis points when all new and planned capital rules were applied, higher than in the last test in 2016 due to credit losses. Europe's banks still lag U.S. counterparts in profitability, quality of loans and cost discipline and the region's banking index .SX7P has lost more than 20 percent this year. The European Central Bank, the banking supervisor for eurozone lenders, separately tested a further 60 smaller banks. Some of these are struggling, but the results of their health check are not public."
-9.518610331725288," Barclays, Banco BPM scrape through EU-wide banking health check LONDON, Nov 2 (Reuters) - British banks Barclays and Lloyds, and Italian lender Banco BPM fared worst on Friday in a European Union wide stress test of banking resilience to simulated market shocks. Analysts have said that banks who fail to complete the “adverse” or toughest part of the test without preserving a capital ratio of well above 5.5 percent, when all new and planned capital rules are applied, risk having to raise more capital or sell risky assets. While none of the 48 lenders tested broke below 5.5 percent, Barclays ended with a ratio of 6.37 percent, Banco BPM with 6.67 percent, and Lloyds with 6.8 percent. Italy’s UBI ended with 7.46 percent. Capital at the UK banks were particularly hit due to their exposure to credit other than secured loans like mortgages. The EBA said the adverse scenario dented the core equity capital ratio across the 48 banks tested by 395 basis points when all new and planned capital rules are applied, higher than in the last test in 2016 due to credit losses. This was EBA’s toughest test yet, but banks started out with higher capital buffers than in the past. “The outcome of the stress test shows that banks’ efforts to build up their capital base in the recent years have contributed to strengthening their resilience and capacity to withstand the severe shocks and material capital impacts of the 2018 exercise,” said Mario Quagliariello, director of economic analysis at the EBA. The EBA said that 25 of the 48 banks tested triggered thresholds requiring them to calculate curbs on dividends and other payouts totalling 52 billion euros ($59.19 billion). The results will be used by banking supervisors to determine capital levels at individual lenders. Britain’s banks are awaiting next month’s results of a separate annual stress test conducted by the Bank of England."
-9.518610331725288," Breakingviews - Barclays endorses status quo with new chair LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Heard the one about the City grandee atop a British bank run by a Wall Street investment banker? Barclays investors certainly have. They will remember that when UK corporate financier Marcus Agius had a double act with hard-charging Chief Executive Bob Diamond it ended in vaudeville, with both eventually resigning over the Libor scandal. Appointing Rothschild & Co’s Nigel Higgins to oversee Chief Executive Jes Staley should end less disastrously. As a dyed-in-the-wool investment banker and deputy chairman of a seasoned M&A adviser, Higgins may well look kindly on Staley’s drive for Barclays to be competitive in its core non-retail business. That stance will be supported by the fact that Barclays’ retrenchment period is over. In the third quarter the bank’s return on tangible equity was 9.4 percent. In that light, the appointment looks like a defence of the status quo and, specifically, Staley’s investment bank bolstering as European rivals Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse struggle. By contrast, outgoing chair John McFarlane, according to author Philip Augar, repeatedly clashed with former CEO Antony Jenkins over cuts to Barclays sizeable trading operations in particular. Higgins has three things to bear in mind. One is to avoid hubris: when McFarlane joined he predicted a doubling of the share price in three years, when it actually fell by a third. Another is the need to identify a replacement for Staley. Having led a bruising restructuring since joining in late 2015 and fallen foul of whistleblowing rules, it would make sense for the CEO to step down next year or 2020, ideally when Barclays has achieved its 10 percent return on tangible equity target, in line with its cost of capital. The final issue is Barclays shares’ persistent discount to book, currently 30 percent. If returns falter, the age-old question about the utility of having a large investment bank will resurface – as will the appeal of activist investor Edward Bramson. If other shareholders suddenly become receptive to his pleas to cull the rainmakers and traders, Higgins will need to use his relationship skills to explain why Barclays’ current structure is fit for purpose."

Barclays, one of Britain’s biggest banks, has been subject to radical transformation in recent years and has faced uncertainty over its leadership, mainly due to regulatory scrutiny of chief executive Jes Staley’s treatment of a whistleblower. Since taking over as CEO in December 2015, Staley has pushed an investment banking-led strategy that has drawn criticism from some shareholders and been the target of a campaign by activist investor Edward Bramson. Bramson's Sherborne Investors SIGC.L holds a 5.4 percent stake in the bank and was in talks with Barclays earlier this year about replacing McFarlane as part of an overhaul. Sherborne told 2018’s AGM in May “you are not getting rid of me yet.” When he retires next year he will have served his full four-year term. “Succeeding John McFarlane, who has done such a sterling job during a period of great change at Barclays, is a huge honor.... I am totally committed to helping Barclays and its people continue to develop and progress,” Higgins said. Barclays said in its statement Higgins has extensive experience of banking and financial services, gained through a 36-year career at Rothschild. It added he had a strong track record as a strategic adviser to multiple major corporations and governments, a wealth of experience in building teams and culture on an international scale, and in growing businesses. Sherborne is a specialist “turnaround” fund that wants Barclays to improve its financial strength and competitive position. The bank last week reported third quarter profit before tax of 1.6 billion pounds ($2.07 billion), excluding litigation and conduct costs, above the 1.33 billion pounds expected by analysts polled by the bank. The profit excluded costs from litigation and fines for misconduct, which have blighted Barclays in recent years as it paid out for misdeeds during and after the financial crisis. Barclays shares closed at 175.54 pence on Thursday. They are down nearly 14 percent so far this year. (This story corrects Barclays shares closing price in last paragraph.)"

A British court dismissed the charges against the bank last May in a decision that the SFO, which prosecutes financial crimes, said it would seek to reverse by applying to the High Court to reinstate them. “The High Court has today denied the SFO’s application to reinstate in respect of all of the charges. As a result, all of the charges remain dismissed,” Barclays said in a statement. The SFO said on Friday it could not comment on the decision, citing reporting restrictions on other cases related to the 2008 fundraising which are set to continue. Barclays denied the SFO’s allegation that a $3 billion loan it made to Qatar in November 2008 was connected with a Qatari investment in the British bank which ultimately helped it avoid a British government rescue during the financial crisis. Qatar, which is a major investor in Britain, has not been accused of wrongdoing, but public companies in Britain are normally prohibited from lending money for the purchase of their own shares, known as “financial assistance”. The collapse of one of its most high-profile corporate prosecutions represents a major setback for the SFO, which has long faced criticism from British politicians. And the verdict deals a decisive blow to the unprecedented, criminal prosecution of a major bank over events which took place at the height of the credit crisis. The SFO’s attempt to try and reinstate the charges, once they were knocked back by a court, was an unusual strategy and some lawyers said they were not surprised it had failed. Sam Tate, a partner at RPC in London, said he did not think it unreasonable of the SFO to have attempted the move and noted it was now for the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and other authorities to continue their parallel investigations. “I wouldn’t describe this as a huge setback. It reaffirms a decision already made by a lower court and it was an unusual process,” Tate said. Separately, four former Barclays bankers face a charge of conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation when they negotiated a capital injection for the bank from Qatar, in a trial due to start in January.

-21.974525578215225," Lawmakers criticize RBS and Barclays for online banking outages (Reuters) - Royal Bank of Scotland RBS.L apologized for outages that hit its online and mobile banking services on Friday, the latest in a string of such failings at British banks which have drawn criticism from customers and lawmakers. RBS later on Friday said it had fixed the problems, which followed similar outages on Thursday that hit Barclays BARC.L, the Co-operative Bank 42TE.L and fintech firm Cashplus. Lawmakers on Britain’s Treasury Select Committee, in letters published on Friday, called on Barclays and RBS to explain what caused the problems and set out how they would compensate customers who suffered financial losses as a result. The outages come when Britain’s lenders have been driving customers toward such services as the banks cull branch networks to cut costs. Regulators and politicians are increasing scrutiny over banks’ cyber resilience. “High street banks justify the closure of their branch networks on the basis that they are providing a seamless online and mobile phone banking service. These justifications carry little weight if their banking apps and websites cannot be relied upon,” Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury Committee, said. Morgan gave the banks until Friday Sept. 28 to respond to her questions about the outages. Royal Bank of Scotland Chief Executive Ross McEwan told LBC Radio that the outage may be related to regular changes it had made to its technology, such a change to its firewall, but the cause was not clear yet. “The team are working flat out… We feel the pain for our customers every time this happens,” he said. The RBS outage on Friday also affected NatWest, RBS’s most highly rated brand among customers. The lender used Twitter to apologize to customers and said telephone banking and ATMs were working as normal. Many customers took to social media to complain about the outage. “So how do you expect me to pay my bills today when I work 9-5,” Natalie Wilkinson said in a tweet to NatWest, asking other users to recommend a more reliable bank. The consequences for banks of online banking problems and the subsequent scrutiny of those failings by politicians can be severe. Earlier this year a major outage at mid-sized lender TSB, owned by Spain's Sabadell SABE.MC, left thousands of customers unable to access their money or make vital payments for long periods. TSB Chief Executive Paul Pester resigned this month, following heavy criticism by the Treasury Committee and the bank’s customers for his handling of the crisis. British banks do not have long to strengthen their contingency plans for when online banking services fail. The Bank of England and the Financial Conduct Authority in July set a deadline of Oct. 5 for British lenders to explain how they can avoid damaging IT breakdowns and respond to the growing threat of cyber attacks."
-19.525365916283583," Barclays and UK government launch £1 billion house-building fund LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's government and Barclays BARC.L launched a fund on Wednesday to provide up to 1 billion pounds ($1.3 billion) in finance to small house-builders in an attempt to tackle England's housing shortage. Barclays said it would offer 875 million pounds of finance while Homes England, a government agency created at the start of the year, would provide the remaining 125 million pounds. Britain’s government aims to increase annual home-building to 300,000 from 217,000 last year, at a time when buying a home is unaffordable for many young Britons, especially in London and southern England. The finance is targeted at small and medium-sized builders, who account for a much lower share of new construction than before the financial crisis. Loans will range in size from 5 million pounds to a maximum 100 million pounds, and will cover up to 80 percent of costs or 70 percent of the value of the project, Barclays said. Projects can include houses for purchase as well as social housing, privately rented housing and retirement homes. “This new fund ... is a further important step by giving smaller builders access to the finance they need to get housing developments off the ground,” housing minister James Brokenshire said.

-4.188479460665409," Barclays shifting ownership of European branches to Irish unit ahead of Brexit: sources LONDON (Reuters) - Barclays BARC.L has begun shifting direct ownership of its French, German and Spanish branches from a British-based entity to its Irish bank, according to sources with direct knowledge of the plans, ahead of Britain's exit from the European Union. The move shows Barclays putting its Brexit contingency plans into action, in common with other banks which are not waiting for the outcome of negotiations over how financial services will operate after Britain leaves the EU in March. The British bank outlined plans to expand its EU-based Irish entity in a slide presentation to investors earlier this month, saying the unit would primarily consist of Barclays corporate, investment and private banking activities and its Barclaycard credit card business in Germany. In addition to the French, German, and Spanish branches, Barclays will ultimately move all of its European branches under control of Barclays Bank Ireland, one of the sources said. Its other main corporate and investment banking businesses in Europe include Luxembourg, Switzerland, Portugal, Italy and the Netherlands, according to a Reuters review of company filings. Barclays Bank Ireland will have total assets of around 224 billion pounds ($286 billion) after absorbing all the European business, Barclays said in its presentation to investors, out of 1.1 trillion pounds for the entire bank as of the end of 2017. Barclays no longer operates a consumer banking business in Europe, having sold the last of its retail operation in 2016 as the bank shifted its global strategy to focus on the United States and Britain. While Barclays’ European branches will still ultimately be owned by its London-listed holding company, the change in organizational structure shows how lenders are shifting business to try to avoid any disruption that Brexit might cause. Banks are trying to ensure that even under a ‘no-deal’ scenario, where Britain would crash out of the EU without any agreements in place, they would still be able to serve EU customers as before. British banks have largely chosen to base their main European hubs wherever they already have a suitably licensed existing subsidiary, as they seek to minimize costs and inconvenience in the event a last-minute deal renders the reorganizations unnecessary. Barclays rival HSBC HSBA.L has begun shifting direct ownership of its European branches from its British entity to its French subsidiary, while Lloyds LLOY.L is planning three EU subsidiaries, Reuters reported in July."
-6.717558088797963," Activist Sherborne in talks with Barclays over new chairman LONDON (Reuters) - Activist fund Sherborne Investors is in talks with Barclays about replacing chairman John McFarlane as part of a plan to overhaul the British bank. Sherborne, which built a 5.4 percent stake in the lender earlier this year, said in its first half results on Wednesday it was engaging with the lender over the search process and the mandate for McFarlane’s successor. In what are Sherborne’s first public comments about its Barclays investment, the activist also disclosed that it was talking to the bank about its capital allocation, quality of earnings, capital adequacy, and cost structure. Sherborne said “addressing these matters could improve Barclays’ financial strength and its long-term competitive position”, adding that its “intention is to continue its dialogue with Barclays for as long as it appears to be appropriate to do so.” In May, investors briefed by Sherborne told Reuters that the fund was calling on Barclays to end the bulk of its trading activities at its investment bank, to help lift returns and cut costs. McFarlane is a financial services industry veteran who has been chairman of Barclays since 2015. The 71-year-old told shareholders at the bank’s annual meeting in May that he had asked the chairman of its nominations committee to prepare for his eventual departure, but added that he was not poised to leave. “You are not getting rid of me yet,” McFarlane told the meeting, following speculation he could exit the bank soon. Sherborne is led by Edward Bramson, who has previously embarked on overhauls at a number of British companies including Electra Private Equity and chemicals business Elementis. Barclays did not comment on Sherborne’s results and the fund declined to comment further. The market had been waiting for more definitive signs of Bramson’s influence at one of Britain’s largest lenders ever since his stakebuilding came to light in March. “It was not all about him (Bramson) coming in and making dramatic changes, it’s a combination of valuation and subtle changes to the strategy,” one fund manager who holds shares in both Barclays and Sherborne told Reuters. “Let’s judge his actions 12 months after he took the investment, not 6 months.” A second Barclays investor, who recently spoke to the bank’s management, agreed that Bramson should be given at least a year to see if he is having a positive impact. But he flagged continued tensions between Barclays and the activist in their engagement so far. “They felt his analysis was flawed and had done their own calculations on the costs of attempting to do what he wanted, describing the costs in terms of capital burnt in the process as ‘terrifying’,” the fund manager said. The bank last week posted pre-tax profit of 1.9 billion pounds for the April-June quarter, an increase from 659 million pounds a year ago and better than the 1.46 billion average of analysts’ estimates compiled by the lender. Jes Staley, Barclays’ chief executive, said last week the bank was holding conversations with Bramson and they had met, but the activist “has not outlined what his strategy is to us.” Sherborne raised 700 million pounds by listing its latest fund on the London stock market in July last year. It said on Wednesday that the fund’s net asset value attributable to shareholders had fallen to 607.3 million pounds as of June 30 from 695.9 million pounds at the end of 2017 based on Barclays share price. Shares in the bank have declined by about 5 percent so far this year to trade at 192.96 pence on Wednesday."

-7.212141425474054," Soaring profit fails to quell Barclays investment bank debate LONDON (Reuters) - Barclays' BARC.L second-quarter pretax profits almost trebled in the absence of hefty payouts for legal problems but the British lender faced further questions about the role of investment banking in its strategy. Barclays reported pretax profit of 1.9 billion pounds ($2.5 billion) for the April-June quarter, up from 659 million pounds a year ago and higher than the 1.46 billion average of analysts’ estimates compiled by the bank. The improved profitability showed years of restructuring starting to pay off for Barclays, one of the big five that dominate the banking industry in Britain. But little improvement to income at its investment bank brought the performance of that part of the business back into focus after questions raised by activist investor Edward Bramson. “It is the first quarter for some time with no significant litigation or conduct charges, restructuring costs, or other exceptional expenses which hit profitability,” American CEO Jes Staley said in a statement. Income in the investment bank rose just 1 percent in the first half of 2018, largely due to outperformance in the equities division, where revenues rose by 30 percent bolstered by strong sales of derivatives products. Barclays shares initially rose on Thursday but were down 0.9 percent by 0930 GMT against a 1.7 percent fall in the broader STOXX Europe banks index .SX7P. “If you could invest in Barclays excluding the investment bank it would be a great investment. Sadly you cannot – and it now looks like 2018 is shaping up to be another strong start followed by weak second half,” analyst Edward Firth at broker KBW said. The Barclays investment banking performance compared favorably with European peers which have struggled in recent months, but paled in comparison with U.S. peers which have reported their best revenues since 2011. Staley faces a call to cut back the trading arm of the investment bank from Bramson, the New York financier who disclosed a surprise 5 percent stake in Barclays in February. Bramson has argued in presentations to his investors that the lender should pare parts of the investment bank that do not directly serve corporate clients. “We are in conversations with Bramson, I have met him, and we look forward to meeting him post these results, but he has not outlined what his strategy is to us,” Staley told reporters on a conference call. Barclays’ core capital ratio, a key measure of financial strength, rose to 13 percent, just above analysts’ average forecast of 12.9 percent. That number had been depleted by fines and misconduct costs and was a source of concern for investors in recent months, fuelling speculation the bank might need to raise fresh capital. The bank said it would pay an interim dividend of 2.5 pence per share, above analysts’ expectations and above the 1 pence paid at the same time a year ago. Barclays still faces a raft of problems that threaten to dent its numbers in future. The UK’s Serious Fraud Office is seeking to resurrect its prosecution of Barclays over undisclosed payments to Qatari investors, and the bank faces a host of investigations into interest rate manipulation and its conduct in foreign exchange trading. Barclays separately announced on Thursday it is taking a minority stake in MarketInvoice, a financial technology firm which allows small businesses to borrow money secured against invoices to their customers."

-12.373175164565197," Barclays boss says UK finance sector will dodge Brexit bullet LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s banking industry will emerge largely unscathed from Brexit and retain its position as one of the world’s top two financial centres for the foreseeable future, Barclays’ Chairman John McFarlane told Reuters. Home to the world’s highest number of banks and largest commercial insurance market, the City of London and its sister district in east London’s Canary Wharf are scrambling to prepare for Britain’s departure from the European Union, the biggest challenge the UK financial sector has faced since the 2007-2009 financial crisis. McFarlane shrugged off fears expressed by some bankers and politicians that a blueprint for Britain’s future trading relationship with the European Union, proposed by Prime Minister Theresa May, would cripple job creation and trigger London’s rapid decline as a global financial services centre. “I don’t think in the long run that there will be terminal damage [to London],” McFarlane said in an interview in his capacity as chair of lobby group The CityUK. Brexit will cost Britain up to 12,000 financial services jobs in the short term, the City of London financial district’s leader, Catherine McGuinness said on Tuesday, and many more jobs might disappear in the longer term. But McFarlane said London would remain Europe’s primary hub for financial services because the city has the continent’s deepest markets and broadest pool of talent, scotching doomsayers who claim the sector could end up the biggest loser from the end of unfettered access to EU markets. Supporters of Brexit admit there may be some short-term pain for Britain’s $2.9 trillion economy, but that long term it will prosper when cut free from the EU which they cast as a failing German-dominated experiment in European integration. A sharp spike in Italy’s cost of borrowing in late May also handed EU stakeholders a sobering reminder that the EU needs London’s markets as much as London needs the EU, McFarlane said. Short-term Italian bond yields suffered the biggest one-day jump since 1992 on May 29 after a fresh phase of political turmoil forced the government to pay the highest yield in more than five years at an auction of six-month debt. And when prices tumbled, London-based traders and market makers with age-old relationships with the world’s biggest investors executed the largest volume of Italian government bond trading, McFarlane pointed out. “The only reason that was dealt with is because London existed. Given that we have a competitive advantage in those areas that is not easily replicated, that is a fair argument for why people need to use this system going forward. Because it is better than the alternative,” he said. The financial sector accounts for 12 percent of Britain’s economic output, but McFarlane said the government’s dismissal of the sector’s preferred plans for access to the EU single market post-Brexit will not be as destructive as some commentators have predicted. Many had pinned hopes on a bid for “mutual recognition” - whereby Britain and the EU would accept each other’s rules in exchange for broad two-way market access - as the best way to protect financial contracts and activity worth trillions of euros once Britain exits the EU on March 29. Prime Minister May has instead chosen to build trading ties on a legal mechanism known as “equivalence”, whereby the EU deems a country’s rules to be as robust as its own. McFarlane said the government now needed to act fast to negotiate “expanded equivalence” for Britain after critics said the regime exposed firms to sudden loss of EU market access. “You need to get on with it. Aggressively. Because radical change in this space is difficult,” he said. The EU has so far opposed any attempts to modify equivalence and said it has no plans to reform the regime. McFarlane, who has chaired the British lender and TheCityUK since 2015, said he was confident May would avert a potentially chaotic ‘no deal’ scenario, despite recent ructions in Westminster that have put further strain on Britain’s relationship with EU negotiators. “I am always optimistic until I am pessimistic, and that line has not been crossed. While it is all to play for, we should play for it and secure it ... Economic logic must win through somewhere and therefore we have a very good chance of securing something,” he said. Concerns about the future prosperity of Britain’s financial services sector have surged since some of its biggest employers scrapped ‘wait and see’ policies on relocation, and began executing plans to shift people and resources from the UK to multiple EU outposts. Barclays has announced plans to shift up to 200 roles to the continent as part of its Brexit planning. McFarlane, however, said he felt reassured that May and her cabinet were striving to protect the interests of the private sector, despite statements to the contrary made by ex-ministers. Recalling a recent dinner attended by May, UK Finance Minister Philip Hammond and around 20 senior banking executives from all over Europe, McFarlane said both politicians impressed with their grasp of the biggest problems the industry faced. “She came, she had no notes but she was fully prepared and she was impressive. It was highly symbolic to that group that she cared,” he said. “I don’t think the official part of government is dismissive of business ... if anything, they are fighting our corner.”"
-13.272430939347062," UK prosecutor seeks to restore criminal case against Barclays LONDON (Reuters) - The UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO) said on Tuesday it was seeking to resurrect a high-profile prosecution of Barclays BARC.L over undisclosed payments to Qatari investors during the credit crisis two months after a London court dismissed its case. The agency had been praised as “fearless” for taking on one of the world’s largest banks when it first charged Barclays and four former senior executives - including a one-time chief executive - with criminal offences in June 2017. But the prosecution fell at the first hurdle after a London court in May threw out its charges of conspiracy to commit fraud and unlawful financial assistance against Barclays Plc - and a charge of unlawful financial assistance against its subsidiary, Barclays Bank Plc. Barclays had been charged over payments to Qatari investors in connection with a two-part, 12 billion pound ($16 billion) emergency fundraising, that included a $3 billion loan to Qatar at the height of the credit crisis in 2008. The deal allowed the bank to avoid a state bailout. The SFO said it had applied to the High Court for permission to serve a draft indictment, a rare legal procedure once called a “voluntary bill of indictment”, that allows prosecutors to challenge a decision made in the lower Crown Court. The SFO last applied for a voluntary bill of indictment unsuccessfully in a Welsh mining rights case in 2014 -- and lawyers said it was a risky strategy. “The SFO is attempting a second bite of the cherry, which could be a high-risk strategy and viewed as a misstep,” said Charles Kuhn, a partner at law firm Clyde & Co. Barclays, which said in May it expected the SFO to try to reinstate the case, plans to oppose the application. It declined to comment on the substance of the SFO’s case. The case centers on agreements between Barclays and Qatari investors during two fundraisings in June and October 2008. Qatar Holding, part of the Qatar Investment Authority sovereign wealth fund, and Challenger, an investment vehicle of former Qatari prime minister Sheikh Hamad bin Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani, invested more than 6 billion pounds in Barclays. Authorities examined whether payments from Barclays to Qatar at the same time, such as “advisory services agreements” and the $3 billion loan, were honest and properly disclosed. Public companies in Britain are normally prohibited from lending money for the purchase of their own shares, a process known as financial assistance. Qatar, a major investor in Britain, has not been accused of wrongdoing. Any failure to revive the case would mark a major setback for the SFO, which narrowly avoided being rolled into a broader crime-fighting agency last year. It is awaiting the arrival in September of new director Lisa Osofsky, a former FBI lawyer. The SFO dropped an investigation into Lloyds Banking Group LLOY.L and individuals in July over alleged rate-rigging, blaming insufficient evidence. Barclays shares were trading 1.35 percent firmer at 1244 GMT, outperforming a 0.8 percent rise on the FTSE 100."

A lawyer for the SFO told a London court on Thursday that Carlo Palombo, 39, Sisse Bohart, 41, and 61-year-old Colin Bermingham would face a second trial on charges they conspired to defraud by dishonestly manipulating Euribor rates between January 2005 and December 2009. They deny wrongdoing. Two co-defendants, former Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE star trader Christian Bittar and one-time Barclays BARC.L trader Philippe Moryoussef, are due to be sentenced later on Thursday. Lawyers for Palombo and Bohart said they were disappointed by the SFO’s decision. “We have made detailed written submissions to the SFO... that it would not be in the public interest to re-try our client, but sadly those submissions have been ignored in a single sentence reply,” Bohart’s lawyer, John Milner, told Reuters. “We will continue to fight the good fight.” Prosecutors allege the trio conspired with others to dishonestly skew rates designed to reflect interbank borrowing costs in order to bolster bets on interest rate derivatives. Barclays declined to comment. Deutsche Bank did not immediately provide a comment."
-13.428641352230327," Ex-Barclays Euribor trader Moryoussef convicted in absentia in Britain LONDON (Reuters) - A French former trader with Barclays BARC.L, tried in his absence by a London court, has been convicted of helping to mastermind a five-year plot to rig global interest rates. After an 11-week trial, 50-year-old former senior derivatives trader Philippe Moryoussef was found guilty of conspiracy to defraud by dishonestly manipulating Euribor (Euro interbank offered rate) for profit between January 2005 and December 2009. Three of his co-defendants, however, face a possible retrial. The prosecution was the first to focus on Euribor, a reference for rates on more than $150 trillion of financial contracts and consumer loans worldwide. Moroccan-born Moryoussef is expected to be sentenced on July 20 alongside compatriot Christian Bittar, a 46-year-old Senegal-born former Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE trader who pleaded guilty in March before the trial began. He is already in custody. Bittar, described by investigators as one of the world’s best-paid traders, earned about 60 million pounds ($80 million) over the indictment period alone. A conspiracy to defraud conviction carries a jail sentence of up to 10 years. Reporting restrictions were lifted on Thursday after the jury failed to reach a verdict on three of Moryoussef’s former colleagues; Italian-born Carlo Palombo, a former trader who reported to Moryoussef, Sisse Bohart, a Danish ex-junior trader and rate submitter, and her one-time boss Colin Bermingham. Achim Kraemer, a 22-year Deutsche Bank veteran still employed by the bank, was acquitted unanimously. He said in a statement that he wanted to rebuild his life and resume his career. “(Bittar and Moryoussef) were senior figures who abused their positions for personal gain and to advantage the banks they worked for,” said Mark Thompson, interim director of Britain’s Serious Fraud Office (SFO). The SFO said it would decide within seven days whether to seek a retrial of Palombo, Bermingham and Bohart. Deutsche Bank and Barclays declined to comment Global authorities have fined leading banks and brokerages about $9 billion and charged about 30 people over rate-rigging allegations. Barclays paid $453 million in 2012 and Deutsche Bank settled its case for $2.5 billion in 2015. The SFO’s fifth rate-rigging trial brings to seven the number of people convicted in a six-year investigation. But nine have been acquitted and the agency also faces the challenge of enforcing its latest conviction. Moryoussef left for France after Bittar’s guilty plea was made public and had no defending counsel in court. His Paris-based lawyer, Francois De Casto, said his client was under the protection of French law. “Philippe Moryoussef will eventually refer this case to the European Court of Human Rights,” he said. The SFO had originally wanted to prosecute 11 individuals in the case, but French and German authorities refused to extradite five of their citizens. Prosecutors cast Bittar and Moryoussef, old friends who cut their teeth in banking at France's Societe Generale SOGN.PA, as the ringleaders of an international, inter-bank scam to deliberately flout rules by asking rate submitters to nudge rates up or down to bolster trading books in a ""zero sum game"". Vast derivatives profits could ride on a basis point, or 0.01 percent, change in Euribor rates, which are set over various time frames. In messages read out in court, Moryoussef emailed Palombo on October 1, 2006, saying: “My mobile won’t be connected on Monday. Two things, ask Sisse to put a high 6 month (Euribor)... and Christian as well ... we have 2 billion on that date. We definitely have to make one BP (basis point) on that fixing. Good luck, bye.” The defendants denied dishonesty, said they had learned their trade on the job and that they believed there was nothing wrong with requesting or accommodating preferential trades. Rate requests were made openly and fell within a range of equally valid rates, they said. Defence lawyers told the court there was no evidence that Kraemer, Palombo, Bohart and Bermingham had financially benefited from the alleged scam. In a statement read out to the jury during the trial, Moryoussef said trader requests were an established practice at Barclays when he joined in 2005 and that he believed submitters would choose a correct rate from a permitted range of estimates."

-7.781937093209041," Former Barclays banker tells Euribor trial she always acted honestly LONDON, May 29 (Reuters) - A former Barclays banker, charged with conspiring to manipulate Euribor interest rates, told a London criminal court on Tuesday that she had followed the instructions of her bosses and always believed she had acted honestly. Sisse Bohart, a 41 year-old Dane, told a jury at Southwark Crown Court that the trial was focusing on a routine and small part of a job she did 12 years ago that took just minutes of her day. Supported by her mother, two step sisters and two brothers in the public gallery, Bohart said she had been told by superiors to accommodate trader requests for rates if she could. But she said she had been unaware that traders were discussing how to influence benchmark rates with peers at other banks until she saw the case against her. Asked by her lawyer Amanda Pinto how she would have reacted to inter-bank contacts had she been aware of them at the time, she said: “I would have spoken to Colin (Bermingham, her boss) because my first thought when seeing it is it is wrong.” Bohart, Bermingham, Italian-born Carlo Palombo, German Achim Kraemer and Philippe Moryoussef, who is being tried in absentia, each deny one charge of conspiracy to defraud by dishonestly manipulating Brussels-based Euribor between 2005 and 2009. The group, aged between 39 and 61, is the first to be charged in relation to Euribor, the euro counterpart of the London interbank offered rate (Libor) - crucial benchmarks for around $450 trillion of financial contracts and loans worldwide. Euribor and Libor are average interest rates calculated after submitters at a panel of major banks report their banks’ estimated costs of borrowing from each other over differing borrowing periods to an administrator. The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) prosecutor argues that bankers deliberately disregarded that these rates should be set independently of commercial interests, prejudicing the economic interest of others. Bohart, who joined Barclays as an IT desktop support worker in 2002 before becoming a junior trader and rate submitter in 2004, said she had always acted openly. She sat between two senior managers, all conversations could be heard and communications were monitored, she said. “I followed what I believed was the right way of doing things - how I saw things being done and told by my manager Colin Bermingham,” said Bohart, who has an 11-month-old son. She described Bermingham as a very caring, supportive, knowledgeable and honest man, who often drove her to the airport on a Friday so she could fly home for the weekend to be with her sick step-father and, later, to see her boyfriend. At times emotional, Bohart said she had been shocked when SFO officers called her in November 2015 on her mobile phone while she was at work in Sweden, seven years after she had left Barclays in 2008. Asked why she had come voluntarily to be tried, she said: “I believe that when you have done nothing wrong it should be OK to stand and tell my story.” (Reporting by Kirstin Ridley; Editing by Mark Potter)"

The Financial Times reported on Wednesday that Barclays' senior board members were exploring a deal with another bank and chairman John McFarlane was keen on the idea of a possible combination with Standard Chartered STAN.L. Barclays declined to comment on the FT report. “We are entirely focused on executing our strategy, and do not comment on this type of speculation,” a spokesman for Standard Chartered said. Two sources close to Barclays told Reuters no deal was in the works and the bank had no plans to combine its operations with any of its rivals. But the speculation about a potential deal comes as both banks face pressure from investors to boost returns after years of costly restructuring. For Barclays, the FT report said the moves were part of wide-ranging contingency plans being considered in response to pressure from activist investor Bramson, who has become one of its biggest shareholders. Chief Executive Jes Staley is betting that an aggressive push in investment banking will revitalize profits and dividends against a backdrop of dwindling competition from European rivals. But the New York-based Bramson wants Barclays to axe its expensive trading operations and focus on its retail, corporate and credit card businesses which deliver superior and more dependable risk-adjusted returns, three sources familiar with the matter have told Reuters. Standard Chartered shares rose by 1.4 percent on Wednesday while Barclays shares were trading down 0.7 percent in line with the FTSE index of British banks .FTNMX8350. Senior sources at Barclays said they have met with Bramson but not yet heard his full proposals for what changes he wants to see. Analysts were however skeptical about the logic of a potential deal and its compatibility with Bramson’s aims of creating a leaner and more tightly focused bank. “Given Standard Chartered’s business mix, the suggested rationale, as a response to Barclays’ activist interest, makes absolutely no sense to us,” said Ian Gordon, analyst at Investec bank in London. The FT report said that Barclays International Unit chair, Gerry Grimstone, supported McFarlane’s idea of a tie up with StanChart. The FT said that a private conversation had taken place between a director at each bank about the potential benefits of such a deal, but no formal or informal bid approach had taken place. Edward Firth, analyst at KBW in London, said both banks were grappling with strategic problems that would not be resolved by a merger, pointing to Barclays’ under-performing investment bank and StanChart’s inability to generate enough capital to exploit growth opportunities in its core Asian markets. “One underperforming business plus another underperforming business give you a larger underperforming business,” Firth said."

-14.046189783048636," British court dismisses charges against Barclays over 2008 Qatar deal LONDON (Reuters) - A British court has dismissed charges brought by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) against Barclays BARC.L over its 2008 capital raising, the bank said on Monday, suspending for now the threat of regulatory sanctions on its business operations. The SFO was however not prepared to let the case drop. “We are likely to seek to reinstate the charges by applying to the High Court,” an SFO spokesman said. It was not clear when that application would be heard. Barclays denied the SFO's allegation that a $3 billion loan it made to Qatar in November 2008 was connected with a Qatari investment in the British bank which ultimately helped it avoid a British government rescue during the financial crisis, unlike its rivals Lloyds LLOY.L and Royal Bank of Scotland RBS.L. An end to the SFO’s case against Barclays and its operating subsidiary would remove the biggest remaining legal headache facing Barclays over its conduct during the financial crisis. The collapse of one of its most high-profile corporate prosecutions would also represent a major setback for the SFO, with the prosecutor’s office under fire from politicians in recent years. Qatar, which is a major investor in Britain, has not been accused of wrongdoing itself, but public companies in Britain are normally prohibited from lending money for the purchase of their own shares, known as “financial assistance”. The SFO had been pursuing charges that Barclays unlawfully received such financial assistance, and that it had conspired with former senior executives to commit fraud over two so-called ‘advisory services agreements’ between Qatar and the bank which facilitated the fundraising. Even if the SFO were to fail in its efforts to reinstate the charges, Barclays still faces other legal and regulatory problems related to the 2008 fundraising. The U.S. Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating the advisory services agreements. Separately four former Barclays bankers face a charge of conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation when they negotiated a capital injection for the bank from Qatar, in a trial due to start next January. The four are former chief executive John Varley, and senior executives Roger Jenkins, Tom Kalaris and Richard Boath. Barclays said the dismissal of the charges against itself should not be taken to have any bearing on whether other people may have committed a criminal offence. Lawyers representing Boath and Jenkins declined to comment, while lawyers for the other two did not immediately respond to requests for comment. British businesswoman Amanda Staveley has a separate $1 billion civil lawsuit against Barclays over the same fundraising. Staveley’s private equity group PCP Capital Partners is claiming damages for alleged fraudulent misrepresentation in a row over whether Barclays offered Qatar and Abu Dhabi investors the same deal terms for participating in a fundraising in 2008. Barclays has called the PCP lawsuit “misconceived”. Staveley declined to comment.

The deal marks the second large-scale mortgage securitsation this year for the British lender, after a group led by Barclays in April bought 5.3 billion pounds worth of residential mortgages from the British ‘bad bank’ set up to manage the assets of two failed lenders. It shows the continuing trend of European banks selling assets to investors such as hedge funds and private equity firms, as they attempt to shrink their balance sheets to focus their businesses and comply with tougher capital regulations. Barclays has already lined up a group of investors to buy the former Lloyds loans, according to Cecile Hillary, head of Barclays’ asset finance business which it opened last year. “This kind of deal shows the continued deleveraging of financial institutions in Europe that has taken place since 2011, and the investor appetite for good quality residential mortgages,” Hillary said. Barclays will complete the purchase and securitisation of the loans in the next two months before selling them on to a group of investors including M&G Investments, the investment manager arm of British insurer Prudential Plc. The portfolio consists of around 27,000 mortgages that were originated between 2004-2010, mostly in Dublin, Barclays said. While the deal resembles the repackaging of home loans for resale to investors that was one of the underlying causes of the last financial crisis, changes in regulations as to how such deals are created and sold mean the risks to the system should be lower. Barclays, for example, will retain at least 5 percent of the overall Lloyds mortgages as part of risk retention rules designed to align the originator of such deals’ interests more closely with those of their investors. Analysts on Friday immediately questioned the logic of Barclays buying such a large portfolio of home loans, given the potential impact on its already stretched core capital level. “It seems extraordinary that Barclays is buying these loans - even if they only plan to warehouse them in the investment bank before selling them on,” said Edward Firth, analyst at KBW in London. A Barclays spokesman said there will be no long-term negative capital impact. ($1 = 0.7416 pounds)"
-15.140579188373298," Lloyds sells Irish mortgage business to Barclays for 4 billion pounds LONDON (Reuters) - Lloyds Banking Group LLOY.L has sold its Irish residential mortgage portfolio to Barclays BARC.L for around 4 billion pounds ($5.4 billion) in cash, as part of a plan to focus on its core British market. The deal was the last action Lloyds needed to take to complete its exit from the Irish market, following its closure of its retail banking operation there in 2010. Lloyds is left only with around 4 billion pounds worth of additional Irish mortgages that it will allow to expire over time. Lloyds will now be able to focus on tackling an increasing threat to its dominant position in the British markets from new entrants eager to cut prices to win business. Of the assets sold on Friday, 300 million pounds worth are impaired -- meaning borrowers are struggling to pay them. They generated a pretax loss of around 40 million pounds last year, Lloyds said in a statement. A year to the day after its return to private ownership following the British government’s last sale of its stake in Lloyds, Britain’s biggest lender faces a battle to maintain its grip on the mortgage market. Lloyds shares have fallen 7.6 percent in its first year free from government ownership after a bailout. That makes them the worst-performing stock among Britain’s four biggest banks with rivals RBS and HSBC climbing an average of 10 percent in the same period. Investors fear that Lloyds as the biggest mortgage lender, with a market share of 20 percent, has most to fear from a low interest rate environment that makes finding profitable lending opportunities for banks difficult. “We are concerned about the competition from the mortgage market from new entrants. We think Lloyds has the most to lose; it has the biggest share of the market,” said a U.S.-based hedge fund manager with about $1.2 billion in assets. The fund manager is shorting Lloyds shares, meaning he will profit if the stock declines. The threat to Lloyds' position comes not just from so-called challenger mid-sized banks like Virgin Money VM.L, CYBG CYBGC.L and Metro Bank MTRO.L, but also from HSBC HSBA.L which has to grow its market share to meet profit goals in its newly separated UK banking unit. The rules designed after the financial crisis to partition British banks’ core domestic deposit and savings franchises from their riskier and more internationally-focused investment banking units, have effectively created ‘new’ competitors in the market in the form of British-only lenders such as HSBC UK. “I do think that Lloyds have some challenges. Competition is heating up. It’s not just an issue for Lloyds,” said Jerry Del Missier, founding partner and chief investment officer at Copper Street Capital, which has $162 million in assets. “If you think about what’s happening to the UK banking market with ringfencing, you have a number of banks, including challenger banks chasing the same business,” he added."

-15.658916659210002," Exclusive: Barclays activist urges trading shutdown at investment bank: sources LONDON (Reuters) - Activist investor Edward Bramson is calling on Barclays BARC.L to end the bulk of trading activities at its investment bank, in a radical plan to cut costs and boost returns at the British lender, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Investors briefed by the New York-based financier, who took a surprise 5 percent stake in Barclays in February, said Bramson wanted it to axe all parts of its investment banking operation that did not directly serve corporate clients. The plan would see Barclays keep its money-spinning M&A advisory business and the equity and debt capital markets teams responsible for leading high-value initial public offerings and bond sales, but cull its cash equities, currency and fixed income trading desks, the sources said. Spokesmen for Bramson’s Sherborne Investors and Barclays, Britain’s third biggest bank by market capitalisation, declined to comment. “The trading businesses lack scale, absorb too much risk capital and deliver too small a return,” one of the sources familiar with Bramson’s plan said. “There is a route back to success and respectability for this bank, and this is to focus on the retail bank, Barclaycard and the good bits of the corporate and investment bank (CIB). Management just have to seize it.” Bramson, described as a turnaround specialist on his company website, has until now managed to keep the finer details of his plan to revamp Barclays under wraps since his 700-million-pound ($947 million) investment vehicle - Sherborne Investors Guernsey C - made its stake-building public. Bramson has a strong record of delivering change at his turnaround targets. His previous targets have included British private equity firm Electra ELTA.L, where he forced through an overhaul and his Sherborne fund achieved a return of 113 percent as of May 2017. Sherborne realised returns of 138.4 percent and 143.5 percent respectively from earlier investments in promotional products supplier 4imprint FOUR.L and chemicals business Elementis ELM.L, where Bramson also pushed through turnaround plans, according to documents accompanying the activist fund’s most recent fundraising last year. His investment in Barclays, one of the largest activist plays in Europe’s banking sector for years, follows a decade of painstaking restructuring by Barclays’ board and management, including the sale of its African business and the shedding of 95 billion pounds of risk-weighted assets. But the bank's share price has continued to languish relative to peers including HSBC HSBA.L and Lloyds Banking Group LLOY.L, which also boast higher dividend yields and return on equity, a key measure of profitability. Barclays Chief Executive Jes Staley has championed its investment banking division despite its underperformance in recent years. Staley has recruited a slew of high-fliers from his former employer JPMorgan including Australian investment banking chief Tim Throsby, and more than 40 managing directors charged with restoring profitability to a unit hit by years of upheaval and under-investment in technology. Recent hirings have focused in particular on the trading business that Bramson is eager to see Barclays cut, highlighting the difference over strategy between the investor and Staley. The bank has hired Michael Lublinsky from hedge fund Brevan Howard to head macro trading, Stephen Dainton from Credit Suisse as head of equities and Guy Saidenberg from Goldman Sachs as head of Sales. Staley has highlighted the trio by name as key to improving its profits. The three all have internal mandates to hire more staff and are under intense pressure to boost revenues to justify the investment in the markets business, according to two sources familiar with the matter. It is by no means clear that other Barclays investors are in favour of jettisoning the bank’s trading activities. Some shareholders told Reuters they believed Bramson might be underestimating the challenge of stripping out the investment bank’s underperforming units without hurting stronger parts. Others feared the move could send some corporate clients into the arms of rivals that could offer them a full range of investment banking services, rather than just the higher-margin business Bramson is keen to focus on. Such doubts are shared by one of Sherborne’s largest investors. “I am pretty sure returns in Cash Equities are fairly rubbish but it’s very hard to do ECM (equity capital markets business) and some M&A activities without it,” he told Reuters. “I think the Markets bit of Barclays CIB is more profitable than he thinks it is, if anything it is the Commercial Bank that is the laggard,” he added. One of Barclays’ 20 largest shareholders said Bramson’s plan would trigger significant upfront costs and risked reducing revenues even further. “Closing down large parts of the investment bank would probably be extremely expensive and no doubt mean dividend and buyback restrictions being imposed by the Prudential Regulatory Authority for an extended period given the risks,” he said."
-15.658916659210002," Ex-Barclays trader tells court being a bank VP is like working at McDonald's LONDON (Reuters) - A former Barclays BARC.L trader on trial in London on charges he conspired to rig Euribor interest rates said on Thursday he was no more senior at the bank than people who served burgers at fast-food chain McDonald's. Prosecutor James Waddington told the jury at Southwark Crown Court that Italian-born Carlo Palombo was earning “just shy” of 1.5 million pounds by 2008 and had been promoted to vice president by 2009. But Palombo, the first of five traders charged in the high-profile case to give evidence and face cross-examination, said his promotions had been “very standard” in the industry. “VP means junior,” he said, comparing the title to being “like the guy who serves you at McDonald’s”. Four former Barclays bankers and one Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE employee each face one charge of conspiracy to defraud by dishonestly manipulating Brussels-based Euribor rates between 2005 and 2009. Philippe Moryoussef, a former senior trader who is being tried in absentia, Palombo, Briton Colin Bermingham, Sisse Bohart, a Dane, and Frankfurt-based Deutsche employee Achim Kraemer deny the charge. The group, aged between 39 and 61, is the first to be charged over alleged Euribor misconduct in a global investigation into benchmark rate rigging, which British investigators first started examining in 2012. Euribor, the euro interbank offered rate, and Libor, the London interbank offered rate, determine the rates on around $450 trillion of financial contracts and loans worldwide. Rates such as Euribor are submitted by major banks each day and were designed to reflect their estimated cost of borrowing in different currencies over various time frames. Palombo conceded that he had earned a lot of money in banking, but said he had not been seeking wealth when he became a banker, had taken the job only so he could leave Italy and work in London and that he had never relished being “surrounded by bankers”. “If you want to have a conversation about income inequality, let’s have a conversation about it,” he said. When asked why he had sent requests to submitters for rates that were profitable for his team, he said he had usually been told to do so by superiors, that these requests represented a fraction of his job and “not for a second” did he think they were wrong. If rate submitters had a choice between “equally valid rates”, it was normal practice at the time for the bank to choose a rate that would benefit its business, he said. “Our job was to try to do what was good for the bank, not what was bad for the bank.” Waddington showed the court messages in which Palombo had been asked by his superior, senior trader Moryoussef, to send requests for higher rates to colleagues at Barclays as well as traders at Deutsche Bank and French bank Societe Generale. He alleged that Palombo knew perfectly well at the time that this constituted an “outrageous and flagrant breach” of the rules. Palombo denied this."

-16.41695573811645," Barclays CEO fined $1.5 million for trying to unmask whistleblower LONDON (Reuters) - British regulators and Barclays BARC.L have fined the bank's Chief Executive Jes Staley a combined 1.1 million pounds ($1.5 million) after he tried to identify a whistleblower who sent letters criticizing an employee of the bank. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Bank of England’s Prudential Regulation Authority said on Friday they had together fined Staley 642,000 pounds. That included a 30 percent discount for him agreeing at an early stage to settle. Barclays imposed a 500,000 pound cut to his 2016 pay. The regulatory fine is the first ever such penalty for the sitting CEO of a major bank in Britain, and cast a pall over Staley’s efforts to show the bank has improved its culture since the freewheeling days of before the 2007-8 financial crisis. “Mr Staley’s actions fell short of the standard of due skill, care and diligence expected of a CEO in a regulated firm,” the FCA said. Regulators said the fine was only 10 percent of his overall pay package. Staley, a 61-year old American and former JPMorgan banker who took the helm at Barclays in December 2015, at one stage appeared at risk of losing his job over the probe. “I have consistently acknowledged that my personal involvement in this matter was inappropriate, and I have apologized for mistakes which I made,” Staley said in the bank’s statement on Friday. The regulatory findings will also be closely read by lawmakers keen to ensure top banking officials are held accountable for their actions at a time when there are growing calls to better protect whistleblowers. “I think it is sending entirely the wrong message, especially given that this is the person who is responsible for setting the tone at the top,” said Mary Inman, a partner specializing in whistleblowers at law firm Constantine Cannon. Lawmakers on Friday criticized Staley, and said they would ask the FCA at a hearing why it believes the fines are appropriate as opposed to a harsher sanction. “A CEO should set an example to the firm’s employees. Clearly Mr Staley has failed in this regard,” said Nicky Morgan, chair of the influential cross-party treasury committee on finance. The regulators stopped short of saying Staley was unfit to continue in his role, after he twice attempted to find out who wrote letters raising “concerns of a personal nature” about an unidentified senior employee. “Mr Staley acted unreasonably in proceeding in this way and, in doing so, risked undermining confidence in Barclays’ whistleblowing policy and the protections it afforded to whistleblowers,” the FCA said. Tracking down the whistleblower became a transatlantic effort, the regulators’ report showed. A copy of the envelope of the first letter was sent by Staley’s office via group security to a Barclays employee in the United States “who engaged with their contacts in the U.S. to try and identify the author”. These “contacts” provided the date, time, location and cost of buying postage for the first letter. Group security then made a fruitless attempt to obtain “video footage” of the person who bought postage for the first letter, the report said. It was the regulators’ first case brought under Britain’s new senior managers regime (SMR), a post financial crisis reform aimed at making top staff directly accountable for their actions. “For Barclays employees the positive is the extent to which Staley has put his hand up and acknowledged fault, but it equally raises concerns about the lengths to which the bank was willing to go to and how more junior staff would have been treated in the same circumstances,” said Alexandra Carn, a financial services employment lawyer at Edwin Coe in London. Barclays is subject to the first ever requirements to tell regulators annually about any whistleblowing cases made against senior managers, and any cases where Barclays has sought to identify anonymous whistleblowers. The bank’s “whistleblowers’ champions”, who come under the SMR, will also have to attest personally each year on the soundness of Barclays’ whistleblowing systems. “Having loads of policies and procedures around whistleblowing is only as good as an organization’s desire to adhere to them, otherwise they are just paper,” said Carn. Barclays said in April last year it had reprimanded Staley and would cut his bonus as the two financial watchdogs launched a year-long investigation into his actions. Authorities in the United States are still investigating the case. Barclays shares were flat on Friday ($1 = 0.7381 pounds)"

The fine by the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority included a 30 percent discount for Staley agreeing at an early stage to settle.

-10.254160533810994," Barclays chairman insists not going yet, shareholders back CEO (LANGUAGE ADVISORY: please note strong language in paragraph 13) LONDON (Reuters) - John McFarlane said he is not about to quit as chairman of Barclays, adding that most shareholders backed Jes Staley to remain as the British bank’s chief executive following a misconduct inquiry. Barclays has faced uncertainty over its leadership, mainly due to regulatory scrutiny of Staley’s treatment of a whistleblower and concerns among some investors about its investment bank-focused strategy. McFarlane, 70, told Barclays’ annual meeting on Tuesday that he had asked the chairman of its nominations committee, Crawford Gillies, to prepare for his eventual departure, but added he had only served three years of his four year term. “You are not getting rid of me yet,” he told the meeting, following speculation he could bow out early. Barclays is also under pressure from activist investor Edward Bramson, a turnaround expert who has taken a 5 percent holding in the bank. McFarlane told Michael Mason-Mahon, a frequent bank critic and AGM attendee, that more than 95 percent of shareholders had no worries over Staley’s fitness to run the bank. “You say you have been in banking over 38 years, you should have known better than to bring shame on our bank,” Mason-Mahon said, accusing Staley of hurting the bank’s reputation. There had been speculation Staley could lose his job for trying to identify who sent a letter raising “concerns of a personal nature” about an unnamed senior bank official. But Staley survived the ensuing inquiry with a fine and McFarlane said the “malicious letter” contained false allegations and had not come from within the bank. “If it had been a whistleblow from an employee, then the matter would have been much more serious,” he added. The bank also faced flak from investors over its accident-prone investment platform, which has hit a number of glitches since being overhauled and rebranded last year. Staley has apologized for the problems on the platform, dubbed Smart Investor, which included investors being locked out of their accounts and transfers taking months to complete. “I would rather stick wasps up my arse than recommend using Barclays Smart Investor,” one shareholder told the meeting on Tuesday. The chairman did not respond directly to that criticism. Shareholders have also berated Barclays in recent years for disappointing profits, particularly from its investment bank. Mixed first quarter results last month failed to allay the concerns of some analysts. McFarlane said that the shareholder meeting marked a “turning point”, but agreed there was more to do. Significant investment was still needed to secure revenue growth, benefit from the digital economy and bolster defense against risks such as cybercrime, he said. Meanwhile, Staley said he had no plans to set up a trading desk for cryptocurrencies, after some reports suggested that the bank was gauging clients’ interest. Security guards removed demonstrators who used the meeting to protest at what they said was Barclays’ funding of industries that damage the environment. McFarlane said a review had been carried out into the bank’s financing of tar sands and other natural resources, and this would be published this year."

-15.105472879989229," Barclays confident can restore capital levels depleted by U.S. fine LONDON (Reuters) - Barclays said rising profits from its investment bank will be enough to restore capital levels depleted by misconduct fines in Britain and the United States, as the British lender announced a characteristically mixed set of first-quarter earnings. The earnings came a week after Barclays announced Chief Executive Jes Staley would keep his job but face a fine following the results of a regulatory probe into his attempts to unmask a whistleblower. Staley told reporters he is “very comfortable” with the results of that investigation when asked if he would challenge the findings, suggested he could move swiftly to pay the fine and try to put the matter behind him. Barclays shares initially fell by more than 2.5 percent on Thursday morning as investors digested the bad news in the earnings report first but the shares then recovered. That bad news included a core capital ratio that fell to 12.7 percent and a statutory loss for the quarter of 236 million pounds ($328.3 million), both driven by fines and legal costs from historic misconduct issues. Barclays took a 1.4 billion pound hit from settling with the U.S. Justice Department over the sale of toxic mortgage-backed securities in the run-up to the 2007 financial crisis. Cover for claims against mis-selling of payment insurance products in Britain cost it a further 400 million pounds. Barclays shares recovered partially to be up 0.6 percent by 0905 GMT as investors looked beyond the conduct costs to see an improved performance at its under-pressure investment bank, which executives said will prevent the need for a capital raise. “We feel pretty comfortable, we generated 43 basis points of capital in this quarter alone... so to get back to 13 percent [core capital ratio] is relatively straightforward,” the bank’s finance director Tushar Morzaria told reporters on a conference call. Analysts with both buy and sell recommendations on the stock found evidence in the results to support their ratings. “Buy thesis is intact though we expect much ‘weeping & gnashing of teeth’ on the conference call around capital,” said Joseph Dickerson at Jefferies. Meanwhile Edward Firth at KBW, who has a sell rating on Barclays, called it a “poor set of results missing on all important lines.” Improved income at its investment bank helped Barclays report a better than expected first quarterly pre-tax profit of 1.7 billion pounds ($2.4 billion) excluding the legal and conduct charges, and the bank said it still intends to pay a dividend of 6.5 pence per share in 2018. Barclays’ International division, which contains its under-pressure investment bank, showed signs of improvement with a profit before tax excluding litigation costs of 1.4 billion pounds, better than the 1.1 billion pounds average of analysts’ forecasts. The end of the Staley probe and the U.S. settlement do not mark the end of the bank’s legal and regulatory troubles. Barclays still faces charges by Britain’s Serious Fraud Office over payments to Qatari investors during emergency fundraisings in 2008 that saved the bank from a state bailout. With the announcement of Staley’s reprieve from the harsher possible outcomes of the FCA probe, investors are likely to focus more than ever on their chief source of concern with Barclays, the performance of the investment bank. Barclays said income from its markets business in the first quarter rose 8 percent compared with a year ago, or 21 percent in U.S. dollar terms as the bank suffered in comparison with U.S. peers from earning much of its revenues in sterling. In a further sign of the confidence in its investment bank Barclays said it will re-open its Australian office, two years after the bank shuttered the bulk of its Asia-Pacific investment banking operation.

-18.49427676749974," Barclays chief Staley survives whistleblowing inquiry with fines LONDON (Reuters) - Barclays BARC.L said Jes Staley will be fined by British regulators for attempting to unmask a whistleblower, but will be able to keep his job as the bank's chief executive. The country’s banking watchdogs concluded Staley’s attempt to find out who wrote a letter raising “concerns of a personal nature” about an unnamed senior employee represented a breach of individual conduct, Barclays said on Friday. Staley’s case is the first big test of Britain’s “senior managers regime” (SMR), aimed at making top banking officials personally accountable for their actions after few were punished for their roles in bank collapses during the financial crisis. If Staley accepts the findings of the regulators, it would be the first time that a sitting chief executive of a major bank in Britain has been fined by its regulators. A bank spokesman said the size of the fine had yet to be determined. Barclays said the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Bank of England’s Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) were “not alleging that he (Staley) acted with a lack of integrity or that he lacks fitness and propriety to continue to perform his role as Group Chief Executive Officer”. News of the FCA and PRA fines follows a more than year-long probe in Britain that had led to speculation among some investors and bank insiders that Staley could have been forced to step down if deemed unfit to continue by those authorities. Barclays also said that the FCA and PRA will not take enforcement action against the bank, while authorities in the United States are still investigating the case. “Staley will live on to fight another day – which we welcome as a positive development for the bank and a relief for shareholders,” John Cronin at Irish broker Goodbody said. Barclays shares rose 0.5 percent by 0741 GMT, against a 0.8 percent rise in the FTSE 350 banks index .FTNMX8350. “He’s been delivering on the strategy far more effectively than his predecessor had and therefore absent any sort of genuine malpractice we’re pretty keen for him to crack on,” one of the bank’s top 40 investors said. Activist investor Edward Bramson has taken a 5 percent stake in Barclays, piling pressure on Staley to fix low returns at its investment bank. “While today’s news is interesting, Bramson’s presence and plans are still more important for the share price trajectory,” a second top-40 investor in Barclays said. The British bank, which in April last year said it had reprimanded Staley and would cut his bonus for his attempts to identify the whistleblower, will be required to report to the FCA and PRA on aspects of their whistleblowing programmes. The watchdogs could have banned Staley and opting for a fine could dent the fledgling SMR’s credibility. “The magnitude of banning the sitting CEO of such a systemically important institution made outcomes other than a fine unlikely, but the case does set an interesting precedent,” said Nicholas Queree, an associate at law firm Peters & Peters. Staley received the draft warning notice last week and was given 28 days to accept the findings or appeal. If he agrees to pay the two fines he would get a 30 percent discount. The fines have been set according to a formula that considers the type of offense, the offender’s position in the company, any financial hardship, any previous cases, and whether there was any monetary benefit from the offense. “We ... will announce the outcome once this issue has reached a conclusion,” the FCA and PRA said in a statement. Legal experts question whether a light sanction for Staley could send a signal to other potential bank whistleblowers that they risk unmasking if they speak out. Barclays said it will recommend Staley’s re-election as a director at its board meeting on May 1. At the last annual meeting he faced resignation calls, but was given a public endorsement from Chairman John McFarlane. Staley’s pay package was 3.88 million pounds ($5.45 million) in 2017, 8.5 percent less than the previous year."
