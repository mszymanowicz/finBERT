12.339482885682159," Quest beats profit estimates on demand for COVID-19 tests as cases surged (Reuters) - Medical device maker Quest Diagnostics Inc’s quarterly profit beat estimates on Thursday, boosted by robust demand for its COVID-19 testing services as coronavirus infections surged in the United States. Medical device makers such as Quest and rival Abbott Laboratories have benefited from higher demand for COVID-19 testing, which has helped offset the hit from pandemic-led deferred medical procedures. The health crisis has led to a decline in discretionary medical procedures, hampering demand for medical devices, as doctor and hospitals scramble to attend coronavirus infection cases. Quest said demand in its diagnostics unit, excluding COVID-19 testing, improved rapidly throughout the summer and fall, however the recovery stalled at the end of November and December due to the surge in COVID-19 infections across the country. Quest posted fourth-quarter revenue of $3 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of $2.93 billion. Revenue from the company’s diagnostic information services business, which includes COVID-19 and other tests, rose 58.5% to $2.92 billion. The company said it expects net revenue between $4.85 billion and $5.15 billion, and adjusted diluted per share profit of between $5.90 and $6.90 in the first half of 2021. Separately, Quest Diagnostics raised its quarterly dividend by 10.7% to $0.62 per share and said its board has increased its share repurchase authorization by $1 billion. Excluding items, Quest earned $4.48 per share during the reported quarter, beating analysts’ estimates of $4.24 per share."

-1.2416931935749307," Quest Diagnostics reports rise in turnaround time on COVID-19 testing demand surge (Reuters) - Quest Diagnostics Inc DGX.N said on Tuesday the nationwide surge in coronavirus cases has led to a slight increase in turnaround time for its COVID-19 testing. Testing orders increased by about 50% compared with the last week of September, Quest said in a weekly testing update, adding it was also experiencing increasing constraints on supplies, including test kits. The number of U.S. infections documented to date surpassed 11 million on Monday, a little more than a week after crossing the 10-million mark - the fastest time it has taken for the national tally to grow by a million cases. Several U.S. governors, from the coastal states of New Jersey and California to the heartland of Iowa and Ohio, acted on Monday to restrict gatherings and boost face-coverings in confronting a coronavirus surge they warned is out of control. Quest said the turnaround time for its COVID-19 molecular diagnostic testing is now slightly more than two days for all patients and up to two days for priority patients. Its average turnaround time until last week was two days for all patients and one to two days for priority patients. The company cautioned turnaround times may increase even further, as it expects COVID-19 cases and testing orders to rise in the future."

Rival Abbott Laboratories on Wednesday also projected demand for COVID-19 tests to rise next year, even if a vaccine is developed, and lifted its 2020 profit forecast. Quest said it performed 93,000 molecular tests and 11,000 serology tests per day for COVID-19 in the quarter, with an average turnaround time of less than two days. “We are increasing capacity and that should get us eventually coming out of this year at 250,000 (COVID-19 tests) per day,” Chief Executive Officer Stephen Rusckowski said on a call with analysts. The company currently has the capacity to perform 200,000 tests per day. Quest is reviewing the new reimbursement policy for COVID-19 molecular testing from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. The agency earlier this month said Medicare will pay $100 only to laboratories that complete high throughput COVID-19 diagnostic tests within two calendar days of the specimen being collected, starting Jan. 1. “We need to understand exactly when the clock starts on turnaround time. We expect to be in very good shape around meeting the criteria,” Chief Financial Officer Mark Guinan said. The company expects 2020 adjusted earnings per share to be between $9 and $10, up from a prior forecast of $7.50 to $9. Quest said there was an uptick in base testing volumes, which excludes COVID-19 testing, in the United States in the third quarter as healthcare centres began to operate at pre-pandemic levels. The company said it would return the $138 million it had received under the federal government’s CARES Act earlier in the year to help weather the health crisis.

The U.S. retailer has partnered with Quest Diagnostics and drone services provider DroneUp, to test-deliver collection kits in north Las Vegas from Tuesday and plans to conduct a trial run in Cheektowaga, New York in early October. Earlier this month, Walmart piloted drone delivery of grocery and household products in Fayetteville, North Carolina, as it accelerated the expansion of its pickup and delivery services with virus-wary consumers preferring home delivery. The drones launched on Tuesday will drop the COVID-19 self-collection kits on driveways, front sidewalks or backyards of homes within a one-mile radius of designated Walmart stores. Customers can self-administer the nasal swab and send back samples to Quest Diagnostics for testing.

Quest Diagnostics has come under fire for delivering Covid-19 test results slowly, but the U.S. laboratory-testing company’s financial figures and stock price are speeding ahead. Quest said on Thursday that revenue and earnings per share for the year would top estimates thanks to a recovery in medical procedures. The $50 billion Quest and rival Laboratory Corporation of America dominate the United States’ testing market. Earlier this year high-margin non-essential tests were postponed as doctors’ offices closed for fear of spreading the coronavirus. That market is recovering, while Covid-19 testing continues – as of August, Quest had performed over 13 million molecular tests. The company was swamped, admitting in July that non-essential Covid-19 tests were taking “at least seven days”. Such delays render a test nearly useless, but Quest’s market power means insurers were still paying up. If the turnaround time doesn’t improve while the company continues to reap financial benefits, that could easily become a political problem. (By Robert Cyran) TROUBLE AHEAD. International Consolidated Airlines’ brave face is not without cracks. While asking shareholders for 2.5 billion pounds in additional Covid-19 buffers, the British Airways owner is pointing to surprisingly gloomy horizons, with travel restrictions and quarantines playing havoc with its revival plans. In the last three months of the year, IAG reckons capacity will be down 60% from 2019 levels. Previously, it only foresaw a 46% decline. That’s equally worrying for engineers like Rolls-Royce, whose fate is also tied to planes spending time in the air. The silver lining for investors, including 25% shareholder Qatar Airways, is that costs are also plummeting. IAG says its operations should break even in the fourth quarter. By contrast, in the early stages of the crisis, it was burning through a million pounds an hour. That means steady-state, low-level flying can last for longer – as long as timetable restrictions don’t get any worse. (By Ed Cropley) ARE YOU READY FOR SOME FOOTBALL? The National Football League’s 101st season kicks off on Thursday as the Kansas City Chiefs, the reigning Super Bowl champions, take on the Houston Texans. When the Chiefs’ superstar quarterback Patrick Mahomes takes the field at Arrowhead Stadium, he’ll be surrounded by around 16,000 fans. True, that’s roughly a quarter of the over 62,000 who watched him in the stadium for Super Bowl LIV on Feb. 2 – just days after the United States declared a public health emergency over the coronavirus. Yet it’s still a big break with other major U.S. professional sports venues that are still barring spectators. And it’s a gamble. It’s unclear if fans are excited to head back into even a partially filled stadium – Yahoo Sports cited multiple sources reporting lackluster demand for tickets. And even a few positive cases could prove disastrous to the league’s reputation and future sales. This drive to fast-track normalcy feels like a Hail Mary. (By Anna Szymanski) ABSTRACT VALUE. Covid-19 is testing the limits of creative purchases. Sales of art by galleries around the world contracted by an average of 36% in the first half of this year, a new survey by Art Basel and Swiss bank UBS found. It might have been worse: even as some of the world’s blockbuster art fairs, including Art Basel and Frieze London, have been cancelled, many sellers have moved to online-only viewing rooms. Digital sales made up 37% of the total in the first six months of this year, up from 10% in 2019. New online buyers with whom the gallery had never had personal contact, meanwhile, accounted for over a quarter of online sales. Still, an overwhelming 70% of collectors reported that they still prefer physical in-person sales. It’s difficult enough to create the trendy high-brow gallery experience in real life. Trying to create a virtual alternative will test the palette. (By Sharon Lam) GROCER WOES. UK supermarkets’ pandemic boom is now turning to empty tills. WM Morrison, one of Britain’s top four grocers, revealed on Thursday that its first-half pre-tax profit fell 25.3% to 148 million pounds as the extra costs of hand sanitiser and staff dampened the benefits of a near 9% surge in sales, excluding fuel. The situation could get worse. Supermarkets had a captive customer base during lockdown when restaurants and bars were closed. As the economy reopens, grocers are likely to see a slump in sales, while Covid-19-related costs linger. Tesco, for example, is hiring 16,000 extra staff to satisfy customers’ new desire to buy goods online. Morrisons’ share price is down 8% since the beginning of the year. The grim outlook may also hurt Walmart’s chances of attracting a juicy price for its planned sale of UK grocer Asda. The supermarket party looks well and truly over.

On Thursday Basel-based Dufry said that the private equity firm had pledged to purchase up to 415 million Swiss francs of a planned 500 million Swiss francs rights issue from existing investors who do not take up their shares. That could net Advent a stake of up to one-fifth in the duty-free vendor it exited in 2013, whose stock price has fallen 69% this year as lockdowns grounded planes. Dufry Chief Executive Julian Diaz is in the value aisle too: he wants the money to buy the rest of beleaguered New York-listed Hudson, the travel shop chain Dufry floated in 2018. Still, bargains can be deceptively dear. Dufry suffered an 82% annual decline in passenger flows during July, and a return to 2019 levels is not expected until 2022. At least no one can accuse Advent of being out for a quick buck. (By Christopher Thompson)"

15.18571048454336," Florida cuts ties with Quest over 75,000 COVID-19 test results backlog (Reuters) - Florida on Tuesday cut ties with Quest Diagnostics Inc as the medical device maker failed to share the results of nearly 75,000 COVID-19 tests dating back to April with the state health department in a timely manner due to a technical issue. The health department called it ""unacceptable"", while stating here that it was more of a ""data issue"" as all people who tested positive were notified on time about the results. Without the backlog, the state’s positivity rate for new cases as of Aug. 31 was 5.9%, but that would jump to 6.8% if the data is included, according to the department. Quest said here the technical issue that led to the delay in reporting of a subset of public health COVID-19 test data to the health department has since been resolved. “We remain open to working with the state Department of Health to provide testing that meets the needs required for patient care and public health response,” the company said. Its shares were down nearly 3% at $107.93 in afternoon trade after Florida Governor Ron DeSantis ordered the health department as well as the Florida Division of Emergency Management to severe ties with the company."

0.12405461802276266," Quest medical lab sees COVID-19 test speed at 'acceptable' level by September (Reuters) - Quest Diagnostics Inc DGX.N said on Thursday it expects to cut week-long turnaround times for COVID-19 tests by more than half to get to ""acceptable"" levels by September, responding to concerns that slow testing is hampering the U.S. response. The turnaround time for non-priority testing was now at least seven days but could be reduced by boosting capacity, the company said during an earnings conference call. It aims to increase COVID-19 diagnostic testing to 150,000 per day by next month and ultimately to exceed that level. A shortfall of adequate diagnostic testing has hampered the U.S. response to the pandemic, which has so far infected more than 4 million Americans. “We believe, as we get through August and into September, will have a higher level of capacity,” Quest’s Chief Executive Steve Rusckowski said on the call. “We’ll be able to get the turnaround times that are in the acceptable levels that we’ve had in the past.” A spokeswoman for Quest said its goal is to get test turnaround times back to the 3- to 4-day range for most patients and one day for top priority patients. Quest’s turnaround time for COVID-19 tests was one to two days as recently as April. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services said last week a turnaround time of up to three days is acceptable. Quest said it currently has capacity for about 130,000 tests per day, double its capacity since May. Quest's rival Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings LH.N has also struggled to meet demand for tests. Its chief executive, Adam Schechter, told CNBC on Tuesday that turnaround times have climbed to three to five days for patients who are not in the hospital. It is currently processing about 165,000 tests for COVID-19 per day, he said. The National Institutes of Health said it aims to create capacity for 6 million COVID-19 tests per day by the end of 2020, considerably in excess of the roughly 300,000 daily tests currently conducted by the U.S.’s two largest lab testing companies. Much of that ramp up will require the production of fast and inexpensive antigen tests that do not require a laboratory. Earlier this month, the FDA authorized a rapid antigen test from Beckton Dickinson & Co BDX.N. The company said it could make 2 million per week by September. Testing will be especially important as the U.S. moves towards reopening schools in fall, amid pressure from the Trump administration. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently issued guidance to reduce what a senior U.S. health official described as “unnecessary” testing for COVID-19 as it works to cut turnaround times for tests. “There are some views that maybe that second test to verify your negative is not of great value. And therefore, this might help reduce the demand,” Rusckowski said. Earlier on Thursday, the company reported a slight miss in quarterly revenue, hurt by a decline in non-COVID testing volume versus 2019 due to the pandemic. Second-quarter revenue fell 6.4% to $1.83 billion. Non-COVID testing volumes are expected to remain below 2019 levels for the remainder of year, the company said on the conference call."

So-called priority 1 patients - those in hospitals, pre-operative patients in acute care settings and symptomatic healthcare workers - had an average turnaround time of slightly more than one day, it said. Other patients waited around seven or more days. Last week the company said its average turnaround time was one day for priority 1 patients and three to five days for all other groups. Earlier on Monday, Quest said its second-quarter revenue would top analysts’ estimates, largely due to growing demand for the tests, boosting its shares 2%. The United States has reported record numbers of new coronavirus cases in recent days, with the surge coming from states like Florida, Texas, California and Arizona. Widespread testing is a core requirement for controlling the spread of the novel coronavirus, and test delays raise the likelihood of transmission.

The company said its latest “return to work” services will provide employers access to its blood tests to detect antibodies against the virus, and molecular tests that typically use nasal swab samples to detect the virus. Quest first started its antibody testing in April. The services, customized based on the level of risk for employees, include onsite temperature monitoring, physician oversight and telemedicine, the company said. It will also offer surveillance retesting and contact tracing services, among others. “We’ve seen a very strong interest in these services from companies all around the country,” a Quest spokeswoman told Reuters. Testing for antibodies or blood proteins produced in response to infection has been touted by governments and some experts as a way to identify people who are less likely to fall ill or infect others. However, many U.S. companies are not planning to use them after some reports suggested it was too early to conclude that antibodies to the new coronavirus translate into immunity, Reuters reported earlier this month. Quest’s services are similar to those offered by LabCorp, which earlier this month said it would provide customized services for workplaces including antibody testing and access to its at-home sample collection kit, among others.

10.845183309543813," UPDATE 1-Quest Diagnostics makes COVID-19 antibody test available online at $119 (Adds background) April 28 (Reuters) - Quest Diagnostic Inc said on Tuesday individuals can purchase its COVID-19 antibody test for themselves through its website QuestDirect at $119 without having to visit a doctor’s office. Shares of the diagnostic company were up nearly 2% at $118 in early trading. The stock is up 8% this year through Monday close. Each test request is reviewed and, if appropriate, an order for testing is issued by a licensed physician, the company said, adding that individuals have the opportunity to speak with a licensed physician about their results. Unlike tests to diagnose diseases, antibody tests show who has been infected and recovered. The body makes antibodies in response to many illnesses and infections, including other coronaviruses. Antibody tests are considered a potential game changer in the battle to contain infections and offer the chance to get the economy back on track by identifying people who may have immunity to the virus and could return to their jobs. Last week, Quest said it was launching its COVID-19 antibody test service for healthcare providers to order on behalf of patients and said it expected to perform more than 200,000 tests a day by mid-May.

36.800060997413006," Quest Diagnostics starts antibody testing for coronavirus (Reuters) - Quest Diagnostics Inc said on Tuesday it has started testing using blood samples to detect COVID-19 antibodies and expects to ramp up capacity over the coming weeks as public health experts push for wider testing in the United States. Quest said it was using tests made by Abbott Laboratories and PerkinElmer Inc’s Euroimmun. Both tests use blood serum specimens to detect the presence of immunoglobulin class G (IgG) antibodies. IgG antibody response typically develops by 14 days after symptoms set in. Antibody tests are considered a potential game changer in the battle to contain infections and offers the chance to get the economy back on track by identifying people who may have immunity to the virus and could return to their jobs. The company, which is due to report its quarterly earnings on Wednesday, said it expects to scale up testing to about 150,000 tests a day by early-May from nearly 70,000 tests per day by the end of this week. “As the FDA has indicated, antibody testing has the potential to help healthcare professionals identify people who have been exposed to COVID-19 and who have developed an immune response,” said Chief Medical Officer Jay G. Wohlgemuth. Quest said it will report results within one to two days after collecting the specimen."

2.00641704450543," LabCorp makes coronavirus test available for ordering in U.S. (Reuters) - Diagnostics company Laboratory Corp of America Holdings said on Thursday it will make its coronavirus test available for ordering by healthcare providers from 6 p.m. ET, as the U.S. government ramps up efforts to increase diagnostic capabilities. The news comes as Quest Diagnostics Inc and OPKO Health Inc also said they would be able to begin testing for the virus from next week. The ongoing struggle to expand local testing has been criticized as an early misstep in the government’s response to the outbreak, which has killed more than 3,300 people around the globe, including 11 in the United States. U.S. health officials said on Thursday they expect to deliver enough coronavirus tests to public laboratories this week to test about 400,000 people. Officials expect to ship additional test kits to cover between 1.5 million and 1.7 million people by the end of next week, U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar told reporters. The FDA said last week it would allow some laboratories to immediately use the tests they have developed and validated, while they await the U.S. health regulator’s emergency-use authorization, to achieve more rapid testing capacity. Co-Diagnostics Inc said it was seeing a surge in demand for its coronavirus test kits following the FDA policy change. Previously, only testing kits developed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, many of which were found to be faulty, could be used in public health labs. Quest Diagnostics said its services will be provided as a laboratory developed test, pending review by the FDA under emergency-use authorization. The company said its test service would use respiratory specimens collected in appropriate health care environments, such as hospitals. Vice President Mike Pence said on Wednesday the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services had included coronavirus testing as an essential health benefit, which would require most health plans as well as the government Medicare and Medicaid programs to cover the tests. Analysts at Evercore ISI expect lab tests developed by Quest and LabCorp to be priced around $45 to $50, similar to a flu test. OPKO Health and Co-Diagnostics closed up 24.1% and 19% respectively, while LabCorp’s shares closed down 2.2%."

4.303527879378232," Former FDA chief tells Labcorp, Quest Diagnostics to ""step up"" amid coronavirus outbreak (Reuters) - Laboratory Corp of America Holding LH.N and Quest Diagnostics Inc DGX.N should conduct tests for coronavirus in the country, former Food & Drug Administration commissioner Scott Gottlieb tweeted bit.ly/2PMXwWn on Wednesday. Gottlieb, who is part of Pfizer Inc's PFE.N board, said high complexity labs that perform national testing have the same ability to validate tests as academic and hospital labs that are stepping up to increase testing capacity. “LabCorp, Quest, others; need to get in the game.” U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn told Congress on Tuesday that testing kits should be available by the end of the week that would give labs the capacity to perform about 1 million coronavirus tests. In addition to tests distributed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to public health labs, tests are being made by commercial test maker Integrated DNA Technologies, an FDA spokeswoman told Reuters. The FDA is working with other commercial and academic laboratories to provide even more testing capacity, spokeswoman Stephanie Caccomo said. Labcorp and Quest Diagnostics did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The latest data lists 108 confirmed and presumed cases and nine deaths in the United States so far from the outbreak. Last month, Labcorp said it had started developing its own test for the coronavirus and had engaged with U.S. health agency to make the test available to commercial labs. [nL4N2AD42U]"
