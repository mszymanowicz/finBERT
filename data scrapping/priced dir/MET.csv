Chubb Ltd,one of the world’s largest insurers, MetLife Inc, Liberty Mutual Insurance and Travelers Companies Inc joined a host of companies that are re-evaluating or temporarily stopping political donations. “In light of last week’s mob attack on the U.S. Capitol and attempts to derail the electoral college vote, Chubb has suspended for three to six months all campaign contributions while the company conducts an assessment of its political contribution policies,” it said in a statement. Liberty Mutual said it is suspending political contributions for the first quarter and is reevaluating its contribution strategy.

32.156962168704005," Majority of small U.S. businesses see worst coronavirus impact still ahead -poll WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Most small business owners in the United States believe the worst of the coronavirus pandemic is still ahead of them, with half saying their operations would permanently close within a year unless the business environment improves, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said on Tuesday. A new U.S. Chamber-MetLife poll of small businesses taken from Oct. 30-Nov. 10 showed that 74% of the owners said they need further government assistance to weather the pandemic. That percentage rises to 81% for minority-owned businesses. The quarterly poll found that the 62% of small business owners fear that the worst is still to come with COVID-19’s economic impact. Only 40% said they believe their small businesses can operate indefinitely during the current business environment. “We must ensure small businesses across the country receive the assistance they need from the federal government,” said Neil Bradley, the Chamber’s chief policy officer. “Not passing the bipartisan compromise for temporary and targeted relief risks the permanent loss of tens of thousands of small businesses, financial hardship for millions of Americans, and unnecessary delays in combating the pandemic.” Democrats and Republicans in Congress are still wrangling this week over a new coronavirus relief package that would provide additional unemployment compensation and aid to small businesses and other sectors of the economy hit hard by the pandemic. Bradley said the quarterly survey found that 14% of small businesses are currently planning to cut staff, up from 9% in July and September. Staff reduction plans are back up to the 13% level that the survey saw in April during the pandemic’s first peak, he said. The United States extended its rollout of the first authorized COVID-19 vaccine here Tuesday, inoculating healthcare workers on the frontlines of a pandemic that has killed more than 300,000 people across the country."
28.362782116063844," Breakingviews - Zurich CEO adds feather to cap with MetLife buy MILAN (Reuters Breakingviews) - Mario Greco’s latest M&A swoop confirms his reputation for shrewdness. The 61-year-old Zurich Insurance boss is expanding in the attractive U.S. insurance market thanks to a somewhat less-than-straightforward $3.94 billion deal with rival MetLife. Chunky, stable returns expected from the transaction should ensure the $61 billion Swiss insurer continues to outperform its rivals. Under the terms of the deal, Greco’s largest yet, Zurich will use its Farmers Group subsidiary to purchase the American property and casualty business of MetLife, and then flip it to partner Farmers Exchanges, a mutual insurer, for $1.51 billion. Zurich’s final bill will thus amount to $2.43 billion. Though more complicated than a straight acquisition, the beauty of the structure lies in a sweet arrangement between Farmers Group and its U.S. mutual insurance partner. The Zurich subsidiary provides ancillary services such as premium collection and investment management to Farmers Exchanges for a fee close to 7% of the mutual insurers’ premiums. This makes earnings predictable without eroding Zurich’s solvency ratios. The contribution from Farmers already amounted to 28% of Zurich’s annual operating profit. The MetLife deal should generate an additional annual fee of around $230 million from 2023, says Zurich, plus $30 million in other pre-tax profit. These will come to $260 million once taxed at 24% and after intangible amortisation worth $60 million a year is added back. Divide that by Zurich’s net investment of $2.43 billion, and the return exceeds 10%, well above the 7.8% weighted average cost of capital that GuruFinance attributes to MetLife. The MetLife transaction is the second sizeable one Greco has carried out at Zurich since the Italian executive arrived four-plus years ago. His A$2.9 billion purchase of an insurance unit of Australia and New Zealand Banking Group in 2017, another reasonably large purchase, was also sensibly priced. Investors cannot complain. Since taking the helm in May 2016, Zurich shares have delivered a total return with dividends of 115%, Refinitiv data show. That’s almost twice the return delivered by rival Allianz, and well above those produced by France’s AXA and Italy’s Assicurazioni Generali, which Greco formerly led. With a few years yet ahead of him, Greco has time to put his M&A skills to further use."
28.362782116063844," Zurich, Farmers to buy MetLife U.S. motor, home insurance business for $3.94 billion ZURICH/LONDON (Reuters) -Zurich Insurance and Farmers Exchanges have agreed to buy MetLife’s U.S. property and casualty business for $3.94 billion, the insurers said on Friday, after the COVID-19 pandemic made motor and home insurers more profitable. Motor and home insurers have had a windfall as government lockdowns to curb the spread of infection have reduced the number of claims for road accidents and burglaries. Insurers, such as Zurich, by contrast have faced hefty claims from event cancellation and business interruption and premium rates are rising. “It is an acquisition that complements very well...what we see on the commercial side where the market is hardening,” Zurich Chief Executive Officer Mario Greco told a media call. The Swiss insurer will contribute $2.43 billion to the deal through its Farmers Group Inc (FGI) unit, while the Farmers Exchanges will contribute $1.51 billion, Zurich said. Reuters was the first to report on Nov. 20 that Zurich was in talks to buy the MetLife business. The deal will give Farmers Exchanges, to which FGI provides certain administrative and management services, a nationwide presence in the United States and access to new distribution channels, Zurich said. It will also help Zurich deliver its growth targets for 2022. Chief financial officer George Quinn told the call that the insurer’s targets did not depend on acquisitions, but they “can accelerate what we are looking to achieve”. MetLife President and CEO Michel Khalaf said the sale would allow the life insurer “to focus on our core strengths”. The deal is the latest in the sector. Denmark’s Tryg and Canada’s Intact Financial are buying British home and motor insurer RSA, and Finland’s Sampo and South Africa’s Rand Merchant Investment is buying Britain’s Hastings. Shares in Zurich were down 1.3% at 0825 GMT in a 0.8% lower European insurance market. KBW analysts called the transaction a “great strategic deal,” but reiterated their underperform rating on the stock. The MetLife business to be acquired includes 2.4 million policies, $3.6 billion of net written premiums in 2019 and 3,500 employees, Zurich said. Zurich said it wanted to fund FGI’s portion of the deal through a roughly equal combination of internal resources and hybrid debt. Completion of the transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and is anticipated to occur in the second quarter of 2021."

26.40118447191207," Exclusive: Zurich Insurance nears $4 billion deal for MetLife unit - sources NEW YORK (Reuters) - Switzerland's Zurich Insurance Group AG ZURN.S is in advanced talks to acquire MetLife Inc's MET.N U.S. property and casualty (P&C) car and home insurance unit for close to $4 billion, according to people familiar with the matter. Zurich Insurance issued a statement late on Friday confirming it was in discussions to acquire MetLife’s U.S. property and casualty business and cautioning that no deal was certain. It did not comment on the value of the deal. The deal, executed through its Farmers Group Inc subsidiary, would expand Zurich Insurance’s P&C business, as the industry grapples with fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, which drove up claims for business interruptions and event cancellations. It would also allow MetLife to exit a business in which it faces fierce competition from larger players such as State Farm, GEICO and Progressive Insurance. Its P&C business focuses more on car insurance, an area in which people have made fewer claims due to spending less time on the road during the pandemic. If the negotiations conclude successfully, a deal could be announced by early December, the sources said. MetLife declined to comment. MetLife, whose offerings also include life insurance, employee benefits and asset management, earlier this month reported a 68% drop in third-quarter adjusted earnings at its U.S. property and casualty division, to $18 million. The decline was driven by catastrophe losses caused by storms in the United States, it said. The New York-based company’s chief executive, Michel Khalaf, said during its latest quarterly earnings call that the P&C business had “an important strategic connection” to the rest of MetLife, but declined to comment on whether he would sell it. MetLife has been turning to dealmaking to move into more profitable areas. It said in September it would buy vision-care benefits company Versant Health for $1.68 billion, which would make it the third-largest vision insurer in the United States by membership, and announced in December it would enter the pet insurance market by acquiring PetFirst Healthcare.

The deal, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2020, will add to the insurer’s earnings and free cash flow, MetLife said. Once the deal is completed, MetLife will become the third largest vision insurer in the U.S. by membership, according to the company. The addition of Davis Vision and Superior Vision brands will establish MetLife as a leader in managed vision care, said Ramy Tadros, president of U.S. business for MetLife. Versant was formed in 2017 after Centerbridge combined Superior Vision and Davis Vision, which it acquired in 2016 and 2017 respectively. Linthicum, Maryland-based Versant has more than 33 million members in the United States across its vision care plans, according to its website.

Adjusted earnings fell to $758 million in the second quarter from $1.3 billion a year earlier, MetLife said. Excluding items, MetLife earned 83 cents per share compared with $1.46 per share a year ago.

MetLife reported net derivative gains of $4.2 billion compared with $115 million a year earlier. MetLife holds a book of derivatives to hedge against the risk of market swings. Such gains do not indicate actual performance of the company, but reflect the effect of accounting rules, an issue that has occurred in some previous quarters. On an adjusted per-share basis, the company earned $1.58 compared with $1.48 in the same period a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected a profit of $1.44 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. However, it was not immediately clear if the numbers were comparable.

-33.495052147761434," MetLife profit tops estimates on higher premiums, net investment income (Reuters) - U.S. insurer MetLife Inc MET.N topped estimates for quarterly profit on Wednesday, as premiums and net investment income rose. Life insurers make money by investing coverage premiums into stocks and bonds, hoping to earn more than what they pay out in claims. The company’s net investment income rose 34.1% to $4.64 billion, driven by favorable changes in the fair value of securities. Premiums and fees rose 24% to $13.76 billion in the quarter. Most of the insurer’s businesses including Asia, EMEA and Latin America reported growth. MetLife’s Asia unit’s adjusted earnings grew 21.3% to $341 million, buoyed by volume growth and higher investment margins, while those at its EMEA business grew 20%. The insurer has been working to grow its Asia and EMEA units amid intense competition from online marketplaces and in the highly competitive U.S. market. Adjusted earnings at its Latin America business grew 17.5% to $161 million, partially driven by higher sales in Brazil and Mexico. However, MetLife reported a 1.5% fall in adjusted profit in its domestic business, hurt by weakness in its retirement, and property and casualty segments. The company reported derivative losses of $1.47 billion for the quarter, compared with gains of $939 million, a year earlier. Excluding items, MetLife’s profit rose to $1.83 billion, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $1.34 billion, a year earlier.

-44.393392239050584," MetLife Inc to pay $10 million to settle with SEC after failure to pay pensions WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Insurer MetLife Inc. MET.N will pay $10 million to settle with U.S. regulators over longstanding internal controls failures, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said on Wednesday. The settlement follows a probe by the SEC into the company’s failure to pay some workers’ pensions, which MetLife disclosed in December 2017. The agency found MetLife violated key provisions of the federal securities laws relating to two errors in how it accounted for reserves associated with its annuities businesses, it said in Wednesday’s statement. The case centers on MetLife’s business over the last several decades of acquiring the assets of employer pension plans and converting them into group annuity contracts in a process called pension risk transfer. For over 25 years, MetLife’s practice was to presume annuitants had died or otherwise would never be found if they did not respond to only two mailing attempts made approximately five and half years apart, the SEC said. This led the company to improperly release reserves for their benefits. The insurer also overstated reserves and understated income relating to certain annuity guarantees assumed by a subsidiary. This was the result of data mistakes, including a failure to properly incorporate policyholder withdrawals. The company did not admit or deny the agency’s findings, the SEC’s statement said. “Our focus since we self-identified these issues has been to improve our processes to deliver better service to our customers,” said a MetLife spokesperson. “We successfully remediated both material weaknesses associated with this settlement as of December 2018. MetLife has separately agreed to pay $1 million to Massachusetts to resolve claims that it made misleading statements to investors in failing to pay pension benefits tot thousands of retirees. In January, the company also agreed to a $19.75-million penalty to New York state’s insurance regulator for the failure."

-16.242067718662895," MetLife to foray into pet health insurance with PetFirst Dec 5 (Reuters) - U.S. life insurer MetLife Inc said on Thursday it would acquire privately-held pet health insurance company PetFirst, in a bid to diversify its product offerings and capitalize on a growing market opportunity. The companies did not disclose financial terms of the deal, but said it was expected to close in the first quarter of next year. MetLife said in a statement that the pet insurance market is “under-penetrated and fast-growing”, noting that the annual growth rate for the industry has been more than 20% since 2014. Petowners in the United States are becoming more willing to splurge on their pets, often opting to pay for expensive and cutting edge medicines to treat illnesses, such as cancer. This has resulted in an increasing number of consumers opting for pet insurance. Research firm Global Market Insights estimates the market to be valued at about $10 billion by 2025. MetLife’s deal for PetFirst is also an example of how group life insurers are stepping up efforts to compete in a marketplace that offers financial wellness products and services to employees of their customers. MetLife plans to offer pet insurance to employers through its group benefits programs, starting in the summer of 2020. Indiana-based PetFirst, which was started in 2004, a year after the company’s co-founder had to put his dog down, now covers health costs for about 40,000 pets. Following the acquisition, it will continue to market its insurance through animal welfare societies and directly to consumers.

-11.168214553667696," Generali's MetLife gambit hits price snag - sources LONDON, Dec 3 (Reuters) - Italian insurer Assicurazioni Generali has held talks with U.S. rival MetLife Inc to buy the bulk of its European assets but discussions have stalled due to differences over price, four sources told Reuters. Generali, which ranks as Europe’s third biggest insurer, first approached MetLife earlier this year offering to take on most of its underperforming European business whose adjusted earnings slipped 4% in the third quarter, the sources said. But talks dragged on for more than six months and were hampered by management changes at MetLife, where Michel Khalaf became the New York-based insurer’s new boss in May, they said. Representatives at Generali and MetLife declined to comment. Two of the sources said Generali remained interested in hoovering up a significant chunk of MetLife’s European portfolio, including operations in Britain, France, Italy and eastern Europe, but no agreement could be reached. They said the price and structure of the deal were the main stumbling blocks and ruled out any progress by the end of the year. MetLife’s Khalaf emailed staff in late November saying there were no live discussions with the Italian insurer after media reports first emerged. “Negotiations have been on and off for months. There are still many aspects of the deal that need fine-tuning including the valuation,” a source familiar with the discussions said, ruling out any near-term agreement. Generali has about 3 billion euros ($3.31 billion) for acquisitions, under its latest strategy plan, and its French boss Philippe Donnet is looking at several dossiers, according to a source close to the situation. Any deal must come at a fair price and unlock significant synergies, this source said. Generali wants to boost its presence in certain European countries to drive earnings after pulling back from non-core markets including Belgium and the Netherlands last year. MetLife operates in 26 countries across Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), offering life, accident, health and credit insurance, as well as pension products. The U.S. insurer runs the bulk of its European assets out of Ireland where its main subsidiary - MetLife Europe d.a.c. - has operations in 11 countries including Britain, Italy, Spain and France. MetLife controls three other subsidiaries active in Europe and known as MetLife Europe Insurance d.a.c., MetLife Greece S.A. and MetLife TUnZiR in Poland. The sources said Generali had carried out due diligence on all the divisions, aiming to buy most of the operations including activities in Greece and Poland. But MetLife was reluctant to sell its entire European portfolio unless the price was compelling. Another source familiar with Generali’s strategy said the Trieste-based company was still looking at MetLife’s businesses, but said Generali would only resume efforts to negotiate a deal after its annual results due on March 14, 2020. The source said that although things were moving slowly the talks could gain traction next year. Investors are expected to quiz MetLife on its plans for Europe at a New York investor conference on Dec. 12. MetLife’s EMEA business is the smallest of the U.S. group’s five businesses, with adjusted earnings of $277 million in 2018, compared with $2.8 billion for its U.S. operations and $5.6 billion for the group. Insurers in Europe such as Old Mutual, Prudential and Standard Life have been streamlining their businesses via disposals and mergers to grapple with tougher regulatory scrutiny, low interest rates and fierce competition. French insurer AXA is also considering selling its central European business as part of a restructuring to quit markets where it lacks scale, Reuters reported in October.

Mona Moazzaz, who served as chief administrative officer in MetLife’s global technology and operations department, said in a lawsuit filed in federal court in Manhattan that she was retaliated against and ultimately fired in May after authoring a document calling attention a lack of diversity at the company and other issues. “We believe the allegations are without merit and plan to defend this matter vigorously,” MetLife spokesman Randy Clerihue said in an email. “It is completely unacceptable for companies to pay women hundreds of thousands of dollars less than men who do the same or less work,” said Michael Willemin of the law firm Wigdor, who represents Moazzaz, in a statement. Moazzaz, who joined MetLife in 2012, said in her lawsuit that she was paid hundreds of thousands of dollars less than multiple men with similar or lesser responsibilities and unfairly passed over for promotion. She said that a human resources executive referred to her as a “bitch” and repeatedly called her “the little one” rather than using her name. Moazzaz said a male “leadership coach” the company assigned to her told her she needed to “choose between being pretty and being smart because men can’t put you in both boxes” if she wanted to be promoted. In 2018, Moazzaz said, she authored a “candidate strategy” for a MetLife executive, Martin Lippert, who was seeking to become its next CEO. Among other things, the document said MetLife had fallen short in hiring minorities and promoting women. Lippert lost out to current MetLife CEO Michel Khalaf. Moazzaz said she was fired eight days after Khalaf took over. Khalaf and other MetLife executives are also named as defendants in the lawsuit, which is brought under federal and New York law and seeks unspecified monetary damages."

Adjusted earnings for MetLife’s U.S. business fell 11% to $707 million from the a year earlier. The unit was also pressured by a 16% decline in the retirement business on lower investment margins and less favorable underwriting. Adjusted earnings fell 9% in Latin America. However, adjusted earnings rose 31% in Asia. The insurer has been working on growing its Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Asia businesses to counter intense competition from online marketplaces in the United States. MetLife held $15.6 billion in reserves as of Sept. 30 for long-term care policies that are still active, the company said. The company is among a number of life insurers that typically conduct reviews every third quarter of assumptions they made when writing policies many years ago. As interest rates decline, some life insurers are having to re-think assumptions they made long ago about what they thought rates would be. Some one-time items led analysts to take different approaches to the results. Some excluded a charge related to the rates review and the effect of a dramatic gain in the insurer’s derivative portfolio to conclude that MetLife had beaten their expectations.

-4.432530092202085," MetLife quarterly profit doubles on derivative gains (Reuters) - U.S. insurer MetLife Inc MET.N on Wednesday reported quarterly profit that doubled from a year ago, boosted by strong derivative gains. MetLife recorded $724 million in derivative gains in the second quarter, reflecting changes in equity markets and interest rates. In the year-ago quarter, the company had a derivative loss of $59 million. Premiums and fees dropped 29% to $12.02 billion, from a year earlier when the insurer inked a deal to provide pension benefits for about 41,000 FedEx Corp FDX.N retirees and beneficiaries through an annuity. The 2018 deal was the first “jumbo-sized” U.S. transfer of pension obligations to an insurer, measured by premium, since 2013, an analyst said at the time. A comparable deal, which included about $6 billion in pension obligations and the premium generated, did not occur during the 2019 quarter. MetLife’s adjusted earnings were $1.3 billion, the same as the prior year quarter. Claims fell 33% to about $10 billion. Adjusted earnings for MetLife’s U.S. business were up 9%, spurred partly by lower expenses and favorable underwriting. MetLife’s group benefits business largely drove the increase with adjusted earnings of $311 million, rising 19% over the prior year period. In Latin America, adjusted earnings were up 10%, boosted partly by higher sales in Chile and Mexico. Adjusted earnings for MetLife’s Asia business were down 1%, driven partly by a 12% decline in Japan of annuities tied to foreign currency. The insurer’s Europe, Middle East and Africa business saw a 10% decline in adjusted earnings, after more favorable expense margins in the prior-year period offset favorable underwriting, investment margins and volume growth. Net investment income rose 5% to $4.69 billion, from a year earlier. Life insurers make money by investing premiums they receive for coverage, hoping to earn more than what they pay in claims. Net income available to MetLife common shareholders rose to $1.68 billion, or $1.77 per share, in the second quarter ended June 30, from $845 million, or 83 cents per share, a year earlier.

The deal is the latest in a series of acquisitions FWD has made in the region, and comes after MetLife shelved an earlier attempt to sell its Hong Kong business, worth over $500 million, to a mainland Chinese buyer. “The acquisition is another step towards fulfilling our ambition to build a leading pan-Asian life insurance platform,” FWD Group Chief Executive Huynh Thanh Phong said. The deal highlights the attractiveness of Hong Kong’s insurance businesses, which have been boosted by growing wealth in the city and Chinese visitors snapping up foreign currency-denominated products. Hong Kong’s life insurance market is well-developed, with a life and health insurance premium to GDP ratio of 17.94% in 2017, Asia’s second-highest after Taiwan, according to data from insurer Swiss Re. Hong Kong-based FWD has been aggressively expanding its Asian footprint in the last couple of years, mainly through acquisitions, as it seeks to grab a bigger share of the market from large global as well as local insurers. In March, Thailand’s Siam Commercial Bank Pcl (SCB) said it had entered into exclusive talks to sell its life insurance business to the company. FWD, which agreed to buy HSBC Holdings' HSBA.L 49% stake in the London-headquartered lender's Malaysian life insurance joint venture last year, completed the deal in March. The firm’s Asian presence includes Indonesia, Japan, Singapore, the Philippines, Thailand, and Vietnam. The company is also awaiting regulatory approval in China to launch a life insurance joint venture. The company plans to rename and rebrand the MetLife Hong Kong business, the statement said, adding that all existing MetLife Hong Kong policies will continue to be honored by FWD following the change in ownership."

0.6697073599393121," MetLife profit beats on robust underwriting, volumes (Reuters) - U.S. insurer MetLife Inc beat analysts’ estimates for quarterly profit on Wednesday, buoyed by strong underwriting, volume growth, as well as higher investment income. Premiums and fees rose 2 percent to $11.26 billion in the first quarter from a year earlier, while net investment income jumped 31 percent to $4.91 billion. Life insurers make money by investing premiums in stocks and bonds, hoping to earn more than what they pay out in claims. On an adjusted basis, net investment income rose 1 percent, despite relatively inactive markets, compared with a year ago, when the U.S. corporate tax cuts boosted stock markets. “Our business performance more than offset some market headwinds,” said Chief Executive Officer Michel Khalaf. Khalaf succeeds long-time chief Steven Kandarian, who announced his retirement in January. The company’s shares rose 1.3 percent in trading after the bell. MetLife grew its business across most of its regions, including the United States, Asia and EMEA. The company said it had double-digit volume growth in group, property and casualty and Latin America businesses, while it saw favorable underwriting in its group life and disability business. The insurer is strengthening its Asia and Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) businesses to counter intense competition in the United States, where an already saturated market is seeing the rise of fintech companies. But the insurer’s retirement business saw a 16 percent decline, as volume growth was offset by lower investment margins. Retirement business also fell at rival Prudential Financial, which reported a quarterly profit that missed analysts’ estimates, sending its shares down 3.7 percent after-hours. A slump in income from its individual annuities business also hurt Prudential, the No. 1 U.S. life insurer by assets. MetLife’s net income rose 8 percent to $1.35 billion, or $1.40 per share, in the quarter ended March 31. Excluding items, it earned $1.48 per share, topping analysts’ estimates of $1.27, according to IBES data from Refinitiv."
6.70995214726042," MetLife profit rises 8 percent on higher investment income May 1 (Reuters) - MetLife Inc on Wednesday reported an 8 percent rise in profit for its last quarter under long-time Chief Executive Officer Steven Kandarian, driven by higher investment income and premiums. Life insurers make money by investing premiums they receive for coverage, hoping to earn more than what they pay in claims. Premiums and fees rose 2 percent to $11.26 billion in the first quarter from a year earlier. However, claims eclipsed the growth, rising 4 percent to $9.07 billion. MetLife’s net investment income jumped 31 percent to $4.91 billion, driven by a rise in the value of certain securities. On an adjusted basis, it rose 1 percent despite relatively inactive markets in the quarter, versus a year ago, when steep U.S. corporate tax cuts roiled stock markets. For the company, business grew across most regions, including the United States, Asia and EMEA, but fell 4 percent in Latin America due to higher expenses and a drop in underwriting fees. The insurer has been trying to grow its Asia and EMEA (Europe, the Middle East and Africa) businesses to hold up to intense competition from online marketplace and in the United States, a market crowded with a bevy of insurers that offer competitive prices. The U.S. life insurer’s net income rose to $1.35 billion, or $1.40 per share, in the quarter ended March 31, from $1.25 billion, or $1.19 per share a year ago. On an adjusted basis, the company earned $1.48 per share, compared with analysts’ estimates of $1.22 per share, as per Refinitiv IBES data, although it was not immediately clear if the numbers were comparable. Kandarian, who held the CEO position for eight years and helped the company ride through intense regulatory oversight in the wake of the financial crisis, will be replaced by Michel Khalaf on Wednesday.

6.261674457419132," MetLife misses revenue estimates on weak Asia, EMEA underwriting (Reuters) - U.S. life insurer MetLife Inc missed analysts’ estimate for fourth-quarter revenue on Wednesday, hit by weaker underwriting fees in its Asia and Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) markets. Shares fell about 2 percent to $44.35 in extended trading. Revenue was also weighed down by weaker capital markets in Asia and the impact of the U.S. tax overhaul on the EMEA unit, the company said. Total revenue fell 1 percent to $15.66 billion, missing analysts’ average estimate of $15.93 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The results capture a quarter that analysts had anticipated would be challenging for many life insurers, whose massive investment portfolios were caught in the whims of tumultuous markets toward the end of 2018. Life insurers amped up risk taking in recent years, moving away from safer investments like Treasury bonds, as interest rates remained near rock-bottom levels. The S&P 500 index tumbled about 14 percent during the final three months of 2018, while the MSCI All-World Index dropped 13.21 percent during the period. MetLife’s net investment income slid to $3.46 billion from $4.45 billion a year earlier, driven by changes in the estimated fair value of certain securities. Adjusting for those changes, net investment income rose 7 percent. Net income fell to $2 billion from $2.3 billion. Earnings at the company’s U.S. retirement business more than doubled, buoyed by volume growth, higher investment margins and lower taxes, helping overall adjusted profits rise 38 percent in the region. Excluding one-time items, MetLife earned $1.35 per share. Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.28 per share."

6.216921348591304," MetLife names Khalaf CEO, Kandarian to retire (Reuters) - MetLife Inc MET.N on Tuesday named insider Michel Khalaf as its new chief executive officer to succeed Steven Kandarian, who held the position for eight years and helped the company ride through intense regulatory oversight in the wake of the financial crisis. Khalaf, who headed the company’s U.S. and EMEA business, will move into the new role on May 1 after Kandarian retires, MetLife said in a statement. The new CEO takes over at a time when insurers are bracing for elevated payouts to owners of long-term care policies, which cover expenses like assisted living for infirmed and elderly customers, forcing them to boost reserves. Khalaf joined MetLife in 2010, after the company bought American Life Insurance Company (Alico) from American International Group AIG.N in 2010. Khalaf worked with Alico for more than two decades in several leadership roles across the world. Under Kandarian's leadership, MetLife spun off its longtime business that sold individual life insurance into a new company called Brighthouse Financial BHF.O in 2017. The aim was to boost the insurer's share price, besides creating a more nimble company that was less sensitive to interest rates. Kandarian also pushed for removal of MetLife’s “systemically important” designation, better known as “too big to fail”, a tag that triggers heightened regulatory oversight and requires companies to hold on to more capital. Up to Monday’s close, MetLife’s shares have fallen more than 15 percent since the spin-off of Brighthouse Financial. The stock was up 1.3 percent in early trading on Tuesday. The New York-based insurer reported a profit of $880 million in its latest quarter, compared with a loss of $97 million a year ago due to a charge related to its spin-off."

15.84924991896593," MetLife settles Massachusetts case over unpaid pensions BOSTON (Reuters) - MetLife Inc will pay a $1 million fine to resolve claims that it made misleading statements to investors in failing to pay pension benefits to thousands of retirees it improperly treated as “presumed dead.” Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin announced the settlement on Wednesday. The deal resolves an administrative case that Galvin’s office filed against MetLife in June. As part of the settlement, Galvin’s office said that MetLife will provide payments, with interest, to hundreds of Massachusetts retirees and beneficiaries. In an administrative complaint, Galvin’s office accused MetLife of making misleading statements to investors regarding the sufficiency of the reserves it was required to maintain to meet its obligations to pensioners. Following December’s revelation, MetLife said in February it would increase the reserves by $510 million. The company has estimated that the number of retirees affected, both in and outside Massachusetts, is about 13,500. “Our focus since we self-identified and self-reported this issue has been to enhance our processes so that we deliver better service to our customers,” MetLife said in a statement. “This settlement is in line with that focus.” The case centers on MetLife’s business over the last several decades of acquiring the assets of employer pension plans and converting them into group annuity contracts in a process called pension risk transfer. Galvin’s complaint said MetLife relied on inadequate procedures to contact retirees, many of whom may not have known the company took over the pension responsibilities. MetLife contacted them primarily by sending two perfunctory letters at age 65 and 70-1/2. When retirees did not respond to them, MetLife categorized them as “presumed dead,” the complaint said. By marking someone as “presumed dead,” the assets to which the retiree was entitled were released from the reserve, increasing MetLife’s bottom line, Galvin alleged."

9.63987939189632," MetLife posts profit on higher net investment income (Reuters) - Insurer MetLife Inc MET.N reported a third-quarter profit on Thursday, compared with a year-ago loss, helped by volume growth, favorable underwriting, expense management and improved investment income. MetLife shares were up 3.7 percent in after-hours trade on Thursday, after closing the regular session up 1.8 percent at $41.94. New York-based MetLife is one of the largest U.S. insurers by assets. Net investment income rose to $4.49 billion from $4.3 billion, a year earlier. The results follow MetLife’s annual review of actuarial assumptions that it uses to calculate the capital it must hold in order to pay out claims. Many life insurers review those assumptions during the third quarter to see if they are still accurate. That analysis can prove troublesome for life insurers who, as a result, must set aside funds for claims on older long-term care policies, which cover expenses like assisted living for infirm and elderly customers. But MetLife, unlike some other insurers who have long-term care businesses, did not have to set aside extra funds, it said. Net income available to MetLife common shareholders was a profit of $880 million. The company posted a loss of $97 million a year earlier. On a per-share basis, the company earned 88 cents compared with a loss of 9 cents a year ago. MetLife’s loss in the same quarter last year was primarily due to the separation of Brighthouse Financial, its former individual life insurance business. In the most recent quarter, the company reported adjusted earnings of $1.38 per share, compared with $1.04 per share a year ago. Analysts on average had expected a quarterly profit of $1.27 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. It was not immediately clear if the numbers were comparable.

6.990530851910057," Massachusetts regulator charges Metlife over unpaid pensions BOSTON (Reuters) - Massachusetts’ securities regulator on Monday accused MetLife Inc of making false statements to investors related to its failure to pay pension benefits to thousands of retirees that it improperly treated as “presumed dead.” Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin, the state’s top securities regulator, charged MetLife following a probe that began after the insurer revealed in December it had failed to make payments to retirees. In an administrative complaint, Galvin’s office accused MetLife of making misleading statements to investors regarding the sufficiency of the reserves it was required to maintain to meet its obligations to pensioners. Following December’s revelation, MetLife in February announced it would increase those reserves by $510 million. The New York-based company has estimated that the number of retirees affected, both in and outside Massachusetts, is about 13,500. The complaint seeks an order requiring MetLife to locate all of the hundreds of Massachusetts retirees eligible for benefits and provide them retroactive and continuing payments. It also seeks sanctions, censure and an administrative fine. MetLife in a statement said it has “taken aggressive steps to locate unresponsive annuitants who are due funds and already have or will commence payment, including interest, once the necessary paperwork is complete.” The Massachusetts investigation is one of several launched by regulators in the wake of MetLife’s December announcement. It also faces probes by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and New York’s insurance regulator. The case centers on MetLife’s business over the last several decades of acquiring the assets of employers pension plans and converting them into group annuity contracts in a process called pension risk transfer. Galvin’s complaint said MetLife relied on inadequate procedures to contact retirees, many of whom may not have known the company took over their former employers’ pension responsibilities. MetLife’s efforts to contact them primarily involved sending two perfunctory letters at age 65 and 70-1/2, and when retirees did not respond to them, MetLife categorized them as “presumed dead,” the complaint said. By marking someone as “presumed dead,” the assets to which he or she was entitled were released from the reserve, increasing MetLife’s bottom line, Galvin alleged. MetLife made no other attempts to contact them, yet Galvin said his office since launching its probe has been able to locate the majority of Massachusetts residents missing out on the payments. “They weren’t dead at all,” Galvin said in an interview. “No serious effort was made to find these people.”"

0.5274037575089752," MetLife to provide pension benefits to 41,000 FedEx retirees through annuity (Reuters) - U.S. insurer MetLife Inc MET.N has entered into an agreement to provide pension benefits for about 41,000 FedEx Corp FDX.N retirees and beneficiaries through an annuity, the two companies said on Tuesday. MetLife and FedEx expect to close the deal, which includes about $6 billion in pension obligations, on May 10, they said. The deal is the first “jumbo-sized” U.S. transfer of pension obligations to an insurer, measured by premium, since 2013, wrote Wells Fargo Securities LLC analyst Sean Dargan in a research note late on Tuesday. It also marks MetLife’s entry into the market for jumbo-sized transfers, Dargan wrote. The insurer has historically competed for pension transfer deals with less than $1 million in premiums, Dargan wrote. Some life insurers, including Prudential Financial Inc PRU.N and MetLife, take over corporate pension plans from companies that want to offload them. The insurers then use a group annuity to make regular payments to the retirees and beneficiaries who are entitled to benefits under those pensions. These deals, known as pension risk transfers, have been around for at least 90 years, but rising interest rates and stock market values are expected to make it easier for more companies unload their plans to insurers. In 2017, MetLife disclosed that it had failed to make payments to pensioners whom it could not locate after taking over their plans from private companies. MetLife since been trying to locate the individuals, whom it intends to pay, the company has said. The deal “is a vote of confidence after MET’s group annuitant issues and charges of the recent past,” Dargan wrote. FedEx’s purchase of the group annuity contract will be funded by assets of its pension plan, the company said. The amount of monthly payments to the pensioners will not change, the companies said."

3.503922843531225," MetLife quarterly profit rises 8 percent, helped by tax reform, Asia growth (Reuters) - MetLife Inc MET.N reported an 8 percent rise in adjusted first-quarter profit on Wednesday, boosted by U.S. tax reforms, as well as volume growth in Asia and better results in auto and catastrophe businesses. The U.S. insurer reported adjusted earnings of $1.4 billion, or $1.36 per share, compared to $1.3 billion, or $1.20 per share in the same period of 2017. Analysts were expecting a quarterly profit of $1.17 per share, on average, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. It was not immediately clear if the numbers were comparable. MetLife shares rose 2.3 percent to $46.10 in afterhours trading. The insurer’s adjusted profit strips out the effect of wild swings in derivatives values, which hurt MetLife’s results last year. The gap between its net income and adjusted profit has narrowed, which shows that the company has been taking the right steps to reduce exposure to market volatility, MetLife Chief Executive Officer Steven Kandarian said in a statement. MetLife has been working to regain investor confidence after two financial reporting errors for 2017. On Tuesday, it said Treasurer John McCallion would take over as chief financial officer from John Hele, who is retiring. Two other large U.S. insurers, American International Group Inc AIG.N and Prudential Financial Inc PRU.N also reported results on Wednesday afternoon. AIG's profit fell 21 percent due to higher catastrophe claims and weaker investment income, while Prudential got a profit boost from its annuities business."

-2.6361548172772276," MetLife CFO John Hele retires, treasurer to succeed him (Reuters) - U.S. insurer MetLife Inc MET.N said on Tuesday John Hele has retired as chief financial officer and will be succeeded by the company's treasurer John McCallion. McCallion, 44, takes over as CFO on Tuesday, a day before MetLife is to report first-quarter 2018 earnings. Hele, 59, is expected to stay at MetLife as senior adviser until September. In 2017 MetLife disclosed two key financial reporting errors, including payments it failed to make to pensioners whom it could not locate after taking over their plans from private companies. MetLife cut Hele’s total 2017 compensation by 6.4 percent, to $5.3 million from $5.7 million, a change that reflected the insurer’s “performance in managing financial matters, including material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting,” the company said in an April 26 proxy statement.. A MetLife spokesman declined to comment on whether the errors had spurred Hele’s retirement. He had been with the company for nearly 10 years. “I want to thank John Hele for his service as CFO and for bringing a sharper focus on the true economics of the business we write,” MetLife Chief Executive Steven Kandarian said in a statement. In March, MetLife said it uncovered a reserve miscalculation for a Japanese annuity product during a review it launched in late 2017 and completed early this year. McCallion joined MetLife in July, 2006. He has served as head of investor relations and CFO for Europe, the Middle East, and Africa, among other roles. McCallion has also worked at the insurance audit practice of PwC. MetLife, also on Tuesday, named Stephen Gauster as Executive Vice President and General Counsel. Gauster joined the company in 2016."

-5.2328938758571," MetLife trims compensation for CEO, CFO in year marked by errors (Reuters) - MetLife Inc MET.N reduced total 2017 compensation for its chief executive and chief financial officer, a year marked by two key errors, including payments it failed to make to pensioners whom it could not locate, according to a filing on Thursday. MetLife CEO Steven Kandarian received total compensation of $14.7 million, a 3.6 percent drop from $15.3 million he received in 2016, MetLife said in its proxy filing. Total compensation for the New York-based insurer’s CFO, John Hele, dropped by 6.4 percent, to $5.3 million from $5.7 million, according to the filing, a change that reflects MetLife’s “performance in managing financial matters, including material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting,” MetLife said. MetLife revealed two errors in 2017, including internal failures that resulted in the insurer not making payments to 13,500 pensioners whose plans MetLife took over from private companies. The problem, which MetLife is in the process of trying to fix by locating and paying the pensioners, stretched back 25 years, the company said in January. In February, the company had to boost reserves by $510 million pretax because it had previously released funds for its obligations to the pensioners. In March, MetLife said it uncovered a reserve miscalculation for a Japanese annuity product during a review it launched in late 2017 and completed early this year. “MetLife did not live up to the high standards we set for ourselves,” Kandarian wrote in his annual letter, also on Thursday. The company reduced a cash annual incentive compensation award for each of the two executives by 25 percent to $3 million for Kandarian and $1.5 million for Hele. MetLife also considered MetLife’s total shareholder return in its analysis, it said."
