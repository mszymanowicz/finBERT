14.399115170862837," U.S. housing, manufacturing data suggest economic recovery slowing WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Contracts to buy U.S. previously owned homes fell for a second straight month in October as an acute shortage of properties pushed up prices, though the housing market remains supported by record low mortgage rates. Other data on Monday showed activity at factories in the Midwest and Texas slowing this month, likely as a nationwide resurgence in new COVID-19 infections curbed new orders and disrupted production. The reports support expectations of a sharp slowdown in economic growth in the fourth quarter because of the raging coronavirus pandemic and depleted fiscal stimulus. “Storm clouds are gathering,” said George Ratiu, senior economist at realtor.com. “This winter could pose an unusual challenge for many people across the country, unless Congress takes significant actions.” The National Association of Realtors said its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed last month, decreased 1.1% to 128.9. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast pending home contracts, which become sales after a month or two, would rebound 1.0% in October. Compared to a year ago, pending homes sales jumped 20.2% in October. The monthly decline in contracts suggests a slowdown in sales of existing home sales after they accelerated in October to their highest level since November 2005. The housing market is being driven by record low mortgage rates. The COVID-19 pandemic, which has seen at least 21% of the labor force working from home, has led to a migration from city centers to suburbs and other low-density areas as Americans seek out more spacious accommodation for home offices and schools. The coronavirus recession, which started in February, has disproportionately affected lower-wage earners. At least 20 million people are on unemployment benefits. The 30-year fixed mortgage rate is around an average 2.72%, according to data from mortgage finance agency Freddie Mac. U.S. stocks were trading lower on Monday. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mixed. The United States is in the grip of a fresh wave of COVID-19 infections, with more than 4 million new cases and over 35,000 coronavirus-related deaths reported so far in November, according to a Reuters tally. The resurgence is happening at a time when more than $3 trillion in government coronavirus relief has lapsed. The fiscal stimulus helped millions of unemployed Americans cover daily expenses and companies keep workers on payrolls, leading to record economic growth in the third quarter. Applications for unemployment benefits have increased for two straight weeks and about 13.6 million Americans will lose government-funded jobless benefits a day after Christmas. Another package is expected only after President-elect Joe Biden is sworn in on Jan. 20. President Donald Trump is consumed with contesting his electoral loss to Biden. A second report on Monday showed the Chicago Business Barometer dropped to a reading of 58.2 in November from 61.1 in October. A reading above 50 in the index produced with MNI indicates expansion in factory activity in the Chicago area. The survey’s new orders measure dropped for the first time since May, when the recovery from the pandemic started. The moderation in factory activity was corroborated by another survey from the Dallas Federal Reserve showing its production index, a key measure of state manufacturing conditions in Texas, tumbled to a reading of 7.2 this month from 25.5 in October. Factories in the region reported a significant slowdown in new orders, and were less upbeat about the outlook. The surveys, together with reports earlier this month showing a cooling in activity in factories in New York and the mid-Atlantic region, suggest national manufacturing moderated in November after accelerating in October. The Institute for Supply Management is scheduled to publish its November survey on Tuesday. According to a Reuters survey of economists, the ISM national manufacturing index likely fell to a reading of 58.0 from 59.3 in October. “The manufacturing sector is continuing to recover but remains below pre-pandemic levels,” said Rubeela Farooqi, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in White Plains, New York. “The threat now comes from virus outbreaks that could interrupt activity, disrupt supply chains and weigh on demand.” Robust demand for housing has outstripped supply, boosting home prices out of the reach of many first-time buyers, despite builders ramping up construction. The government reported this month that single-family homebuilding, the largest share of the housing market, raced to the highest level since April 2007. Though homebuilder confidence is at historic highs, builders have complained about shortages of land and materials. In October, pending home sales edged up 0.1% in the South. They were unchanged in the West. Contracts dropped 5.9% in the Northeast and fell 0.7% in the Midwest. “We expect a resurging pandemic, faltering recovery, and depleted inventories to weigh on home sales, particularly if no additional fiscal stimulus is forthcoming,” said Nancy Vanden Houten, lead economist at Oxford Economics in New York."
23.78228268210278," U.S. home contracts post record jump, factory activity improves in Texas WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Contracts to buy U.S. previously owned homes rebounded by the most on record in May, suggesting the housing market was starting to turn around after being hammered by the COVID-19 pandemic along with the rest of the economy. Other data on Monday showed an improvement in manufacturing activity in Texas in June after three months of record or near-record declines in output. But surging infections of the respiratory illness in many regions, including the densely populated Texas, Florida and California, pose a risk to the nascent recovery. The economy fell into recession in February. The National Association of Realtors said its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed last month, surged 44.3%, the largest gain since the series started in 2001. Still, contracts remain 10.6% below their level in February before businesses were shuttered in a bid to slow the spread of coronavirus, almost grounding the economy to a halt. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast pending home contracts, which become sales after a month or two, rebounding 18.9% in May. Pending home sales fell 5.1% from a year ago. Home resales tumbled to a more than 9-1/2-year low in May. Economists believe the housing market could emerge more quickly from the recession, which started in February, thanks to historic low interest rates. Applications for home loans are near an 11-year high and building permits rebounded sharply in May as did new home sales. But record unemployment, with 30.6 million collecting unemployment checks in the first week of June, is a challenge. Stocks on Wall Street were trading higher after a sharp selloff last week. The dollar was steady against a basket of currencies. U.S. Treasury prices were mixed. In May, pending home contracts soared 43.3% in the populous South. They jumped 56.2% in the West and increased 44.4% in the Northeast. Contracts rose 37.2% in the Midwest. There were also signs of green shoots in manufacturing. In a separate report on Monday, the Dallas Federal Reserve said its Texas Manufacturing Outlook Survey production index, a key measure of state manufacturing conditions, increased to a reading of 13.6 this month from -28.0 in May. It said other measures of manufacturing activity also pointed to a rebound in growth this month, with the new orders index racing 34 points to 2.9, its first positive reading in four months. Nearly a third of manufacturers reported an increase in orders. Measures of capacity utilization and shipments also returned to positive territory in June. But manufacturers’ views of broader business conditions were mixed. The general business activity index surged 43 points but stayed negative at -6.1. The outlook index pulled back into positive territory, rising to a reading of 2.7 from -34.6 in May. About 29% of manufacturers said the outlook had improved, up from 12% last month. Factory employment measures remained weak. The employment index rose 10 points to a reading of -1.5, with 15% of firms reporting hiring, while 17% said they had laid off workers. The hours worked index rose to -4.3 from -22.8 in May. Though manufacturers reported paying more for raw materials, a gauge of prices for finished goods remained negative for the sixth straight month. The wages and benefits index returned to positive territory after two negative readings."

32.20420709691527," Cummins slashes CEO pay, cuts employee salaries on coronavirus hit April 3 (Reuters) - U.S. engine maker Cummins Inc said on Friday it would cut salaries of all employees in the United States as well as its chief executive to reduce costs as the impact of the coronavirus pandemic weighs on the industry. Employees working hours will be reduced and their salary cut between 10% and 25%, while Chief Executive Tom Linebarger’s would be halved, the company said. “The impact from the pandemic on the global economy has been sudden and is growing, and it is imperative for us to respond quickly to maintain our strong financial position,” Linebarger said. The company added that it planned to take similar actions outside the United States based on local regulations. The spread of the coronavirus has shut down production and stalled demand for new vehicles across the auto industry, sending automakers and their suppliers scrambling to cover costs and shore up liquidity. General Electric Co has said it would furlough about half its workers in its U.S. engine assembly and component manufacturing operations, while Boeing Co also outlined a plan of voluntary layoffs for employees on Thursday.

-5.782271094200028," U.S. pending home sales increase more than expected WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Contracts to buy previously owned homes increased more than expected in September, suggesting that the housing market was getting a lift from lower mortgage rates though tight supply remains a constraint. The National Association of Realtors said on Tuesday its Pending Home Sales Index, based on contracts signed last month, advanced 1.5% to a reading of 108.7. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast pending home sales rising 0.9% in September. Pending home contracts become sales after a month or two, and last month’s increase suggested a rebound in existing home sales, which declined 2.2% in September. Pending home sales surged 3.9% in September from a year ago. A persistent shortage of homes for sale has constrained the housing market despite lower mortgage rates and a slowdown in prices. Builders continue to complain that a lack of land and labor is making it difficult to break more ground especially on homes priced below $200,000, which are most sought after. Investment in homebuilding has contracted for six straight quarters, the longest such stretch since the Great Recession. In September, home purchase contracts increased 2.6% in the populous South. Contracts rose 3.1% in the Midwest. They declined 1.3% in the West and fell 0.4% in the Northeast."
13.049004725579817," Cummins profit misses estimates; flags slowing truck demand (Reuters) - U.S. engine maker Cummins Inc on Wednesday reported lower-than-expected quarterly profit and forecast full-year sales below analysts’ estimates, raising concerns of a slowdown in sales of heavy-duty trucks in North America, its biggest market. Shares of the company, whose major customers include PACCAR Inc, Daimler AG and Navistar International Corp, fell more than 2 percent to $146.39 in early trading. An expanding U.S. economy has fueled freight demand, driving heavy truck sales to touch a 10-year high at 189,000 units in North America in 2018, according to ACT Research, the industry body tracking commercial vehicle market. However, slowing manufacturing and construction sectors in the U.S. could lead to lower capital spending by companies, leading to plateauing of freight growth in 2019, thereby hurting truck production and revenues at companies including Cummins. The company said it expects 2019 production of heavy-duty trucks in North America to rise merely 2 percent to 292,000 units, a dip from nearly 30 percent growth registered by the industry last year. “Looking ahead to 2019, OEMs and truckers alike are trying to determine when the market will turn negative and making business investment decisions accordingly,” Steve Tam, vice president of ACT Research, told Reuters. Cummins’ downbeat forecast comes as preliminary net orders for heavy-duty trucks in North America plunged 68 percent to 15,800 units in January, according to ACT Research, which attributed the decline to fewer production slots available with the truck manufacturers due to a strong backlog last year. Analysts said the weak January data might be feeding the bears and weighing on the shares of Cummins, as it forecast 2019 sales growth to be flat to up 4 percent and largely below analysts’ expectations of an increase of 2.7 percent, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Excluding items, the company earned $3.48 per share in the quarter ended Dec. 31, missing the Wall Street’s estimate of $3.81 per share. Net sales of the company rose 12 percent to $6.13 billion."
13.049004725579817," Engine maker Cummins reports 12 percent rise in quarterly sales Feb 6 (Reuters) - U.S. engine maker Cummins Inc reported a 12 percent rise in fourth-quarter revenue on Wednesday, driven by strong demand for its engines from the heavy-duty truck makers and the construction equipment sector. Net income attributable to the company was $579 million, or $3.63 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a net loss of $274 million, or $1.65 per share, for the same period a year earlier. In the year-ago quarter, the company took a one-time charge of $777 million related to the U.S. tax reform. Net sales of the company, which competes with Daimler AG , Caterpillar Inc and Ford Motor Co in North America in the engine market, rose 12 percent to $6.13 billion."
9.764783194513669," Strong truck demand drives Cummins third-quarter profit beat (Reuters) - Cummins Inc CMI.N topped Wall Street estimates for quarterly profit on Tuesday, as the U.S. engine maker was lifted by strong demand for trucks in a booming global construction market. An expanding U.S. economy has fueled robust freight demand and a rise in orders for heavy-duty trucks. Revenue in North America, its biggest market, rose 17 percent. The company, whose major customers include PACCAR Inc PCAR.O, Daimler AG DAIGn.DE and Navistar International Corp NAV.N, said its international sales also grew 6 percent in the quarter due to strong demand in India, China, Latin America, and Europe. “Growth in emerging markets, namely Brazil, India and China, will be important drivers for Cummins’ growth, as emerging markets represent approximately 30 percent of sales,” Edward Jones analyst Matt Arnold said in a pre-earnings note. U.S. truck transportation volume is expected to rise 4.2 percent in 2018, driven by a rebound in the manufacturing industry and a healthy economy, according to a forecast from the American Trucking Associations in September. The U.S. trucking industry generated more than $700 billion in revenue in 2017, constituting 79.3 percent of overall U.S. freight revenue. Cummins competes with Daimler AG DAIGn.DE, Caterpillar Inc CAT.N and Ford Motor Co F.N in North America in the engine market. Engine sales for construction equipment in North America jumped 36 percent in the third quarter ending Sept. 30, reflecting a rise in U.S. construction spend, the company said. Revenue at its engine unit, which makes diesel and natural gas engines for heavy-duty trucks, rose 17 percent to $2.73 billion. Revenue at its components unit, which makes turbochargers and fuel systems for engines, increased 14 percent. The U.S. engine maker reduced its tariff-related expenses for 2018 to $80 million, down from a previous estimate of $100 million. However, Cummins on a conference call warned it would take a $250 million hit from tariff-related costs in 2019, and would try to offset these costs through pricing and improvements in its supply chain. Cummins said the company gained $37 million in discrete tax items in the third-quarter, of which $34 million was related to U.S. tax reform. Net income attributable to shareholders surged 53 percent to $692 million, or $4.28 per share, in the quarter. Revenue rose 12.5 percent to $5.94 billion, marginally missing average analysts’ estimates of $5.95 billion. Excluding items, Cummins earned $4.05 per share, above the average estimate of $3.76 per share, according to Refinitiv data. Shares of Cummins were up nearly 1 percent in afternoon trading."

-3.5289823508035565," Cummins to recall 500,000 U.S. trucks over faulty emissions part WASHINGTON/DETROIT (Reuters) - Cummins Inc has agreed to recall about 500,000 medium- and heavy-duty trucks in the United States to correct a faulty emissions control system in the engines it made for the trucks, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said on Tuesday. The EPA said the Cummins recall of vehicles produced between 2010 and 2015 was the largest ever voluntary recall of trucks due to emissions problems. The catalytic reduction systems were found to be less durable than required and will be replaced, it said. A spokesman for Cummins said the recall was “in the best interests of our customer and the environment.” The recall is to replace a faulty emissions control systems component that causes excess nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions. The problem is the result of a defective part and was discovered during emissions standards compliance tests by the California Air Resources Board, which said Cummins “worked collaboratively” with the regulator on the recall. The Cummins spokesman said the recall will be rolled out in two phases, starting with heavy-duty trucks in August and medium-duty trucks next March. A previous recall that is underway involves Cummins engines in around 232,000 Dodge Ram 2500 and 3500 pickup trucks made by Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV. The EPA said the problem does not involve illegal software known as “defeat devices,” which increase the effectiveness of emissions filters to mask pollution levels during tests. Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE has been found guilty of using such software to pass U.S. emissions tests in the ""dieselgate"" scandal which came to light in 2015. Audi AG’s Chief Executive Rupert Stadler was suspended after his arrest in mid-June as part of a broader probe into emissions cheating at the premium brand, which is part of the VW group. Stadler has appealed to a court to be released from custody."

-8.17272197389627," Cummins shares drop as more engines face emissions repair (Reuters) - U.S. engine maker Cummins Inc CMI.N said on Tuesday it was widening field repairs to include engines produced between 2010 and 2015 as it strives to quell emissions regulators' concerns that have already cost the company almost $200 million. In a first quarter results release that beat expectations on both profit and revenue, the company took an initial charge of $187 million in relation to moves to upgrade engines after some pre-2013 systems failed emissions tests last year. Shares in Cummins, which makes diesel and natural gas engines for heavy-duty trucks as well as industrial engines for construction and mining industries, fell as much as 7 percent in response. The company also warned of further charges of up to about $400 million if the California Air Resources Board and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency do not accept its proposed solutions or the company has to order more extensive repairs. Cummins had said last year only that it was investigating engines designed between 2010 and 2015. “The piece we’re looking at is a component on the after treatment system that we used only in North America,” Cummins President Richard Freeland said on a call with analysts. “We’re driven to resolve this thing over the next two quarters. So, we’ll work with agencies, and we’ll get a final answer to this and kind of get this thing behind us,” he said. The charge comes at a time when the auto industry and its suppliers are facing a global regulatory crackdown on diesel emissions and are adjusting their businesses, including investing heavily in electric vehicles. German carmaker Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE is still in the process of emerging from the 2015 emissions cheating scandal that resulted in about $30 billion in fines and other costs. Including the charge, the Cummins’ net income attributable to shareholders fell to $325 million, or $1.96 per share, in the first quarter ended April 1, from $396 million, or $2.36 per share, a year earlier.
