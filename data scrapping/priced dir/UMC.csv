66.36029411764706," Taiwan's UMC pleads guilty, fined $60 million in trade secret theft case WASHINGTON/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Taiwan’s UMC has pleaded guilty to trade secret theft in the United States and will pay a $60 million fine in a case where it was accused of helping a Chinese state-owned chipmaker steal secrets from Micron Technology Inc. The fine is the second-largest ever in a criminal trade secret prosecution, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) said. UMC, formally known as United Microelectronics Corp, China’s Fujian Jinhua and three individuals were indicted in 2018 for conspiracy to steal trade secrets from Micron. As part of the agreement, the DOJ will dismiss allegations against UMC including conspiracy to commit economic espionage, as well as a related civil case. UMC will also be subject to a three-year term of non-supervised probation. “UMC stole the trade secrets of an American leader in computer memory to enable China to achieve a strategic priority: self-sufficiency in computer memory production without spending its own time or money to earn it,” Deputy Attorney General Jeffrey A. Rosen said in a statement. UMC said in a statement that its management was unaware of and did not authorise actions taken by three of its employees who had previously worked for Micron. One of the employees input trade secret information from Micron into an early draft of UMC’s design rules for a DRAM project it was working on with Fujian Jinhua, it said. UMC added it never planned to, and did not transfer Micron trade secrets or any unauthorized third-party information to Fujian Jinhua. The United States alleges Fujian Jinhua used the trade secrets in its memory chip designs. Its indictment against the state-owned firm remains unresolved. Fujian has previously denied wrongdoing. Reuters was not able to reach a company representative by phone or fax on Thursday for comment. In late 2018, the U.S Department of Commerce added Fujian Jinhua to its so-called ‘entity list,’ in effect barring U.S. suppliers from selling to it. The company has since halted chip production plans, analysts have said."
75.85616438356165," Taiwan's UMC hopes to settle U.S. trade-secret lawsuit soon HONG KONG (Reuters) - Taiwanese contract chipmaker United Microelectronics Corp (UMC) said on Thursday it hoped a business espionage lawsuit brought by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) against the company could be settled soon. UMC has been in talks with the DOJ and has submitted a proposal for the matter to be resolved, involving a settlement of $60 million, it said in a filing to Taiwan’s stock exchange. “UMC continues to discuss this case with the U.S. Department of Justice hoping to reach a conclusion as soon as possible,” the chipmaker said in the filing. The DOJ prosecuted an intellectual property theft case against UMC and Chinese memory manufacturer Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co Ltd (JHICC) in 2018, charging UMC with helping JHICC in an attempt to illegally acquire DRAM manufacturing technology from U.S. chipmaker Micron Technology Inc. UMC shares closed up 5.3% at T$33 ($1.15), spurred by news the lawsuit might be settled soon. Taiwan’s stock market ended up 0.3%."
0.5319282281671348," Taiwan's UMC halts R&D activities with Chinese semiconductor firm after U.S. ban TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan chipmaker United Microelectronics Corp 2303.TW said it will temporarily halt research and development activities with its Chinese partner Fujian Jinhua, days after the United States cut off the state-backed firm from U.S. suppliers. U.S. President Donald Trump's administration took action on Monday to cut off Fujian Jinhua from U.S. suppliers amid allegations the firm stole intellectual property from U.S. semiconductor company Micron Technology Inc MU.O. The action against Fujian Jinhua could ignite new tensions between Beijing and Washington since the company is part of the “Made in China 2025” program to develop new high-technology industries. The U.S. Commerce Department said it had put Fujian Jinhua Integrated Circuit Co Ltd on a list of entities that cannot buy components, software and technology goods from U.S. firms. “UMC will follow all government regulations and temporarily hold the R&D activities we are performing for Fujian Jinhua until we are cleared to resume by the appropriate authorities,” the Taiwanese company said in a statement late on Wednesday. “The U.S. ordered sanctions, (so) we will follow U.S. government regulations as well,” Richard Yu, head of UMC’s corporate communications, told Reuters. He said UMC was not considered a “supplier” as the Taiwan company does not export any products to Fujian Jinhua. Attracting semiconductor expertise and talent from Taiwan has become a key part of an effort by China to put the chip industry into overdrive and reduce Beijing’s dependence on overseas firms for the prized chips that power everything from smartphones to military satellites. UMC and Fujian Jinhua signed a technology cooperation agreement in 2016 for UMC to develop memory-related technologies for the Chinese firm, stock exchange filings show. “Jinhua will provide UMC with DRAM related equipment, as well as service fees to cover R&D expenses according to the progress of the technology development. The developed technologies will be jointly owned by both parties,” a statement said. The world’s top two economies are already waging a tariff war over their trade disputes, with U.S. duties in place on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods and Chinese duties on $110 billion of U.S. goods. The U.S. action is similar to a Commerce Department move that nearly put Chinese telecommunications equipment company ZTE Corp 000063.SZ out of business earlier this year by cutting it off from U.S. suppliers."

-13.223894025851447," China court bans Micron chip sales in patent case: Taiwan's UMC TAIPEI (Reuters) - A Chinese court has temporarily barred Micron Technology Inc from selling 26 chip products in the mainland in a ruling over a patent infringement case with Taiwan’s United Microelectronics Corp (UMC), UMC said. The ruling, which hit shares of Idaho-based Micron and other U.S. chipmakers on Tuesday, comes amid an escalating trade spat between Washington and Beijing over tariffs. It also comes as China investigates Micron and its South Korean rivals over price fixing allegations, amid a surge in prices of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips. The Fuzhou Intermediate People’s Court issued a preliminary sales injunction against Micron that prevents it from selling the chips, including DRAM chips and NAND flash memory chips, in China, UMC said in a statement late on Tuesday. Micron, which gets a chunk of its revenues from China, said it had not been served with the injunction and would not comment further until it had reviewed documentation from the Chinese court. The two chipmakers have been at loggerheads since December when Micron filed a civil lawsuit in the state of California, accusing UMC of secret infringement of intellectual property related to its DRAM chips. In January, UMC filed a patent infringement lawsuit against Micron in China. Micron shares closed down 5.5 percent at $51.48, while Nvidia finished 2 percent lower. Intel Corp and Broadcom Inc closed down 1 percent. UMC shares rose more than 3 percent in early trading on Wednesday."
