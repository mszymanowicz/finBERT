14.422044708889958," UPDATE 2-Private equity firm TDR Capital raises Arrow bid to $740 mln Private equity firm TDR Capital has made a fourth offer for European investor and asset manager Arrow Global, the companies said on Monday, at a price of 305 pence per share. Arrow, which buys defaulted customer accounts from retail banks and credit card companies, said it was considering TDR's new proposal. Shares in Arrow rose as much as 29% to 298 pence on news of the bid, which would value the company at about 540 million pounds ($741.7 million). The UK-based company previously rejected TDR's three earlier bids at 250 pence and 265 pence per share in December and at 290 pence per share in January as they undervalued the firm, Arrow said. Zachary Lewy, founder and group chief investment officer of Arrow and owner of about 2% of the company, has agreed to support the fourth offer, TDR and Arrow said. The TDR bid is at a 32% premium to Arrow's closing price last week but remains lower than brokerage Jefferies' valuation of the company at 420 pence per share, said Jefferies analyst Julian Roberts. Arrow swung to a first-half loss last year, mainly owing to a non-cash charge of 134 million pounds as it revalued its balance sheet in the face of the coronavirus crisis. The company said its collections performance was improving, with the business expected to return to profitability in the second half of the year. ($1 = 0.7281 pounds) "

-0.18469524334979656," Israel postpones U.S.-based test of Arrow-3 missile interceptor JERUSALEM (Reuters) - A planned live test of Israel’s Arrow-3 ballistic missile interceptor in the United States has been postponed to improve the system’s readiness, the Israeli Defense Ministry said on Tuesday. Jointly manufactured by Boeing Co, Arrow-3 is billed as capable of destroying missiles in space, an altitude that would destroy any non-conventional warheads safely. Israel regards it as a bulwark against Iran and Lebanon’s Hezbollah. No new date was given for the live test. The system passed its first full interception test over the Mediterranean sea in 2015 and was deployed in Israel in 2017. Israel had planned another test in the summer of 2018 in Alaska, whose expanses would have allowed larger interception distances. The Defense Ministry statement said the postponement had been agreed upon with the Pentagon, which is Israel’s partner in the Arrow system development, “with the goal of reaching maximum readiness for a test on the American range”. The operational capacity of Arrow-3, and earlier generation Arrow-2 units also deployed in Israel, was unaffected, it said. Israel has had difficulties with its Arrow-3 tests. Its first full trial, scheduled in 2014, was aborted due to what designers said was a faulty flight by the target missile. Follow-up Israeli tests last December and January were also called off at short notice due to technical problems. Arrow serves as the top tier of an integrated Israeli shield built up to withstand various potential missile or rocket salvoes. The bottom tier is the already deployed short-range Iron Dome interceptor, while a system called David’s Sling, due to be fielded next year, will shoot down mid-range missiles."
