-6.928574661409526," Oil flow on Colombia's Cano Limon-Covenas pipeline halted after attack BOGOTA (Reuters) - Oil flow through Colombia’s Cano Limon-Covenas pipeline was suspended on Friday after an attack with explosives started a fire, Cenit, a subsidiary of the country’s majority state-owned oil company Ecopetrol, said. The attack took place in a rural area near the municipality of Saravena, in Colombia’s Arauca province, near the border with Venezuela. The incident is the first major attack this year on the 480-mile (773-kilometer) long pipeline - which can transport up to 210,000 barrels of crude oil per day. Last year, there were 29 attacks, Cenit said, some of which caused fires and polluted rivers and streams. “These illegal acts put people’s lives at risk, violate human rights, generate serious consequences for the environment, and affect communities and the oil industry,” Cenit said in a statement. The company did not blame a specific group for the attack but, according to the military, guerrillas from the National Liberation Army (ELN) and dissidents of the demobilized Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, who rejected a 2016 peace deal with the government, operate in the area."

The divestment follows a successful bidding process carried out by Ecopetrol and its partner Korea National Oil Corporation with a number of offers being made, the company said in a statement. Following the purchase, De Jong Capital LLC will hold 100% of OIG’s share capital, Ecopetrol said. OIG is the parent company of Savia (Peru), as well as a number of other companies in Peru and the United States. The value of the deal was not disclosed. The transaction forms part of Ecopetrol’s plan for divesting non-strategic assets and follows the company’s priorities of strict capital discipline, protection of cash, cost efficiency, and profitable growth, it said."
10.298116444775404," Colombia to hold bidding round for investigative fracking projects BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia will hold a second bidding round to potentially grant contracts to companies interested in exploring non-conventional oil and gas deposits, using techniques like fracking, the National Hydrocarbons Agency (ANH) said. Majority state-owned oil company Ecopetrol ECO.CN, Exxonmobil XOM.N, and Drummond already have contracts for investigative projects and may submit offers in this new round, as can other companies, the ANH said in a statement late on Tuesday. Development of non-conventional energy deposits - including hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, for shale gas - is highly polarizing in Colombia and commercial development of such deposits is currently not permitted. Each company can be awarded up to two contracts, the ANH said, and a maximum of four contracts will be granted. “The purpose of the pilot projects is to acquire sufficient scientific information so a decision about the use of hydraulic fracturing can be made, to take advantage of the potential of non-conventional energy sources,” ANH president Armando Zamaro said. Ecopetrol has already submitted a proposal which is under evaluation, the ANH said, and the schedule for the second round will be published shortly."
22.488469277431566," Colombia's Ecopetrol says illegal siphoning of oil pipelines rises in 2020 BOGOTA (Reuters) - An increase of illegal siphoning on pipelines in Colombia is resulting in an average daily loss of 2,500 barrels of oil and refined fuels a day, the Andean country’s majority state-owned energy company, Ecopetrol, said on Monday. Close to 900 illegal valves were found on pipelines during the first eight months of the year, Ecopetrol said in a statement, up from 747 in the same period in 2019. An average of 1,453 barrels of oil and fuels a day was stolen in the first eight months of 2019. Theft of oil and fuels puts communities and the environment at risk, the company added, as the methods used to tap the pipelines can result in spills affecting soil, bodies of water, animals and plants. “Ecopetrol calls on rural communities near hydrocarbon pipelines to remain alert and to report any suspicious activities to the authorities,” the company said. It did not say who was behind the siphoning. At least 20 of Colombia’s municipalities have experienced this type of crime, it said. Crude makes up 2,439 of the average stolen barrels daily, the company said, most of which comes from the 480-mile (773-km) Cano Limon-Covenas pipeline, where 27 illegal valves - mostly in two municipalities in Colombia’s Norte Santander province - have been found. The 190-mile (306-km) Trans-Andino pipeline has also been heavily tapped, with 706 illegal valves found mostly in the provinces of Tumaco and Narino through August, Ecopetrol said. Ecopetrol is working with the armed forces, police, and regional authorities to fight hydrocarbon theft, it said. In the first eight months of the year, Ecopetrol said it also recorded 13 attacks against the Transandino pipeline, 18 against the Cano Limon-Covenas pipeline, and one each against the Bicentenario and Ayacucho Galan pipelines. The company produces the lion’s share of Colombia’s oil output. Last year, Ecopetrol produced an average of 725,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day."

Global oil prices plunged to decade lows, with U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) dropping to negative $40 a barrel on April 20 as supplies ballooned while the coronavirus pandemic ravaged demand. The majority state-owned company, which entered a joint venture with Occidental Petroleum in November last year, said it plans to drill another 22 wells this year. The company drilled 22 wells between November 2019 and June, but production slowed during the pandemic, Bayon told the virtual Asia Pacific Petroleum Conference (APPEC). “By the end of next year we should have over a hundred wells ... Ecopetrol has a portfolio that is largely heavy crudes,” he said. “This is 40 API crude. So it’s very good in terms of balancing the portfolio.” Crude oil’s density is measured in API gravity. Light crudes produce more high quality fuels such as gasoline and diesel. Heavy crudes require further processing of residues to produce these fuels. Asia takes the biggest chunk of Ecopetrol’s crude output, and it is currently working on expanding crude oil sales to India and South Korea, he said. The majority state-owned company was able to avoid production shutdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic as some Chinese refiners are using Colombian crude to meet baseload demand, Bayon said. Bayon expects Colombia’s gasoline and diesel demand to return to pre-pandemic levels “probably by the end of this year, early next year”, while jet fuel will take much longer."

-16.408943822379353," UPDATE 2-Colombia's Ecopetrol narrowly avoids second-quarter loss (Adds quotes, details) BOGOTA, Aug 4 (Reuters) - Colombian oil company Ecopetrol on Tuesday reported a 99% fall in second-quarter net profit, beating analysts’ forecasts it would make a loss, and said it would invest up to $13 billion over the next three years. The majority state-owned company reported a net profit of 25 billion pesos ($6.6 million) in the second quarter, compared with 3.49 trillion pesos in the year-ago period. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) fell 76% to 2 trillion pesos. Analysts had forecast Ecopetrol would swing to a loss, due to the fall in global oil prices. “We presented second-quarter results that aren’t good,” Chief Executive Felipe Bayon told reporters in a virtual press conference, citing the impact of coronavirus and an oil price war earlier this year. Ecopetrol’s results were slightly more robust than those of regional peers Petroleos Mexicanos and Brazil’s Petroleo Brasileiro SA, which reported quarterly losses of around $1.9 billion and $524 million, respectively. Total sales in the second quarter plummeted to 8.44 trillion pesos, from 18.31 trillion pesos a year earlier, the company said. Net profit in the first half of the year fell 98% to 158 billion pesos, while EBITDA for the first six months declined 54% to 7.25 trillion pesos. The company plans to make organic investments of $11 billion to $13 billion from 2020 to 2022, primarily in Colombia, and expects to increase production to 720,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) by 2022. Production in the first half of 2020 was 706,000 boepd, within Ecopetrol’s guidance range. Falling production and profits from Ecopetrol will negatively impact the spending power of Colombia’s government, which received 3.2 trillion pesos in dividends from Ecopetrol in December. While Bayon said Ecopetrol has strengthened its position, he warned of more uncertainty. “We don’t know how much longer this situation will last, if we’re talking months or more,” he said."
-3.124992692773623," Ecopetrol denounces sabotage of 31 wells at La Cira-Infantas oil field BOGOTA, June 14 (Reuters) - Colombia’s majority state-owned oil company Ecopetrol denounced on Sunday the sabotage of 31 wells at an oil field in the northeast of the country, which put the wells offline and led to oil being spilled. The acts of sabotage took place at Ecopetrol’s La Cira-Infantas oil field, near the city of Barrancabermeja, which produces around 35,000 barrels of oil a day. As well as the acts of sabotage, security guards and workers at the field received threats from hooded aggressors to abandon their posts and join a blockade which started five days ago, Ecopetrol said in a statement. The damage to the wells led to oil being spilled, putting local communities and the environment at risk, the company said in the statement. Ecopetrol called on those behind the blockade to suspend attacks and said it was open to talks to review their requests alongside the local mayor’s office and the attorney general’s office. Energy companies in Colombia often see operations become targets of protesters from nearby towns demanding the hiring of local workers, as well as investments in health, education and roads. Ecopetrol is the largest company in Colombia and produces the majority of the Andean country’s oil. It owns two of the most important refineries in the country and most of the oil pipelines.

12.103755125626586," Ecopetrol subsidiary extends, increases pipeline cost aid BOGOTA (Reuters) - Oil transportation companies have agreed to extend reductions for pipeline charges amid a fall in oil prices, Cenit, a subsidiary of Colombia’s state-run oil company Ecopetrol, said on Friday. Private oil companies in the Andean country have been hit hard by falling prices, which dropped on the double shock of low demand due to the spread of coronavirus and a surge in supply. Cenit said it and its transport subsidiaries will extend previously offered financing for a period of up to six months and has agreed tariff discounts and more flexibility in certain contracts with oil companies. “The current situation has affected the entire oil industry, including producers, transporters, refiners and retailers,” the company said in a statement. At the end of April, Cenit said it would offer financing to reduce pipeline tariffs by 50% for a period of two months, followed by a two-month grace period. Private producers group the Colombian Petroleum Association (ACP) scoffed at the offer, saying it would only lead to higher costs later in 2020. Now Cenit and its subsidiaries have offered to extend the financing option for a further four months, with subsequent grace periods agreed with individual companies. The financing offer will not depend on oil volumes or prices. Discounts on pipeline tariffs of between 6% to 21% - depending partly on volumes - were included in 13 contracts in recent weeks, Cenit said. As part of agreements with traders and producers, flexibility clauses were also specified in nine contracts, the company added. The deals cover some 80% of Colombia’s oil production, Cenit said. The government welcomed the agreements between producers and transporters, calling the deals “timely and positive” in a statement. Colombia’s government previously said it was considering an unprecedented intervention in pipeline tariffs. Fees for transporting oil have long been a bone of contention, which the ACP say are excessively high."
15.17509746689447," Ecopetrol cuts capital expenditure plans for second time this year BOGOTA, May 12 (Reuters) - Colombia’s majority state-owned oil company Ecopetrol has cut its investment plans for the second time this year due to the sharp drop in oil prices, which also means reduced production, Chief Executive Felipe Bayon said on Tuesday. Ecopetrol’s capital expenditure for the year now sits in a range between $2.5 billion and $3 billion, he said. In the middle of March, the energy company reduced its investment plan for the year to a range of between $3.3 billion and $4.3 billion, down from the original target of $4.5 billion and $5.5 billion. “Now we are looking at somewhere between $2.5 billion and $3 billion,” Bayon said on a call with investors after the release of the company’s first quarter results. “We are going to defer investments over time in line with the level of activity,” he added. Ecopetrol, Colombia’s biggest oil company, reported a 95% plunge in first-quarter net profit, which fell to 133 billion pesos ($34 million), due to the double shock of plummeting oil prices and surging supply amid falling demand caused by the spread of the novel coronavirus. The company has reduced its production outlook for the year to a range of between 660,000 and 710,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, down from a previous target of around 750,000 boed. Ecopetrol shares on the Colombian stock exchange rose 0.48% early in the session to 2,075 pesos. “The criteria we have taken into account is to assure that all the projects that have an important profitability in terms of production, which are the greatest generators of cash and which best protect reserves, have the corresponding financing,” said Jaime Caballero, Ecopetrol’s vice president of finance. Bayon warned the rest of 2020 will be difficult for the company. The challenges facing Ecopetrol have been echoed around the region. Mexico’s Pemex recently reported a roughly $24 billion first-quarter loss and Brazil’s Petrobras scrapped its debt reduction target. “The second and third quarters are definitely going to be very hard because we are not seeing demand, it has been destroyed, although there has been some minor recovery,” Bayon said."
9.857813154011364," Colombia's Ecopetrol first-quarter net profit plunges 95% on low oil prices BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia's majority state-owned oil company, Ecopetrol ECO.CN, reported on Monday a 95% fall in first-quarter net profit, which came in at 133 billion pesos ($34.3 million), following a sharp drop in global oil prices. The company reported a net profit of 2.745 trillion pesos in the year-earlier period. The decline in profit was due principally to the sharp fall in international oil prices, Ecopetrol Chief Executive Felipe Bayon said in a statement to the country’s financial regulator. “The environment of low oil prices and weak demand determines a new reality to which we must adapt,” he said. Ecopetrol's results came shortly after Mexico's Petróleos Mexicanos PEMX.UL, or Pemex, reported a roughly $24 billion first-quarter loss and Brazil's Petrobras PETR4.SA scrapped its debt reduction target. Global oil prices have fallen on a combination of lower demand amid the spread of COVID-19 and a surge in supply. The company booked an impairment of 1.209 trillion pesos during the first quarter. Excluding the impairment, net profit for the first three months of the year fell 61% to 1.06 trillion pesos. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization declined by 29% in the three months ended March 31 to 5.257 trillion pesos, the company said in a statement. Total sales fell to 15.07 trillion pesos from year-earlier 15.94 trillion pesos, the company said. Colombia cut its forecasted oil production for the year at the end of April to around 850,000 barrels a day from a previous forecast of 900,000 barrels, if oil prices stay near $35 a barrel. Ecopetrol said its production was sustainable at $30 a barrel. Brent LCOc1 closed at $29.63 per barrel on Monday. During the first quarter, Ecopetrol’s production averaged 735,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day, up 1% on the year-earlier period but below the targeted range for the year of 745,000 to 760,000 boed. Bayon told a virtual news conference that output for the year would be negatively affected by low prices. “There is going to be an impact on production,” he said, explaining that output for the year would be between 660,000 and 710,000 barrels boed. Falling production and profits from Ecopetrol will have a negative impact on the spending power of Colombia’s government, which received 3.2 trillion pesos in dividends from Ecopetrol in December. At the time, the government said Ecopetrol dividends would partly compensate for abandoning plans to raise funds from the privatization of state assets."

The crisis caused by COVID-19 and measures taken to prevent spreading the virus makes repairing damage to the pipelines more difficult, Manosalva added. The pipelines are two of the most important in Colombia. The Cano Limon-Covenas pipeline measures 773 kilometers (480 miles) and can transport up to 210,000 barrels of oil per day (bpd), while the 230-km long Bicentenario transports an average of 150,000 bpd. The attacks against the pipelines took place at locations in the Colombian provinces of Arauca, North Santander, and Boyaca, requiring the company to activate contingency plans to avoid contamination of nearby rivers and the surrounding environment, Cenit said. The attacks were attributed to the National Liberation Army (ELN) by a high-ranking member of Colombia’s armed forces who asked not to be named, who also said that pumping oil through the pipelines had been suspended. The ELN, the country’s largest leftist rebel guerrilla group, said it would observe a month-long unilateral ceasefire until April 30 as a humanitarian gesture to the Colombian people who face coronavirus. The company has sent technical and operational personnel to areas of the pipelines affected by the attacks to carry out inspection works while adopting measures to prevent infections of COVID-19, it said. The quantity of oil spilled as a result of the attacks has yet to be confirmed, a spokesman for Ecopetrol said. In March, an explosion destroyed a section of the Transandino pipeline in southern Colombia, but did not cause an oil spill. So far this year, 25 attacks have been carried out against pipelines in the Andean country, Cenit said."

Private oil companies in the Andean country have been hit hard by the falling prices, prompting the Colombian Petroleum Association (ACP) to call for an urgent intervention regarding “excessively high” pipeline costs. The ACP has forecast that oil production in Colombia could fall by 100,000 barrels a day if Brent prices drop below $25 a barrel. Brent crude futures on Wednesday settled at $22.54 a barrel. The financing option is not conditional on transporting a minimum volume of oil or on oil prices, Cenit said."

Ecopetrol ECO.CN expects its first-quarter consolidated net income to fall by 52% to 65% before impairments, compared with the year-earlier period, it said in a statement. It also forecast that its consolidated gross profit and consolidated operating income will be lower by between 32% to 36% and 43% to 47% respectively. The company’s first-quarter performance took a hit from a fall in oil prices, as well as higher operating costs, the depreciation of the Colombian peso against the U.S. dollar and volatility in capital markets affecting the valuation of its financial portfolio, Ecopetrol said. Global oil prices have dropped sharply on a combination of lower demand amid the spread of the coronavirus and a surge in supply. On Monday the price of a barrel of benchmark U.S. oil plunged below $0 a barrel for the first time in history. Ecopetrol expects to book a first-quarter pretax impairment on its non-current assets in a range of 1.15 trillion to 1.25 trillion pesos ($286 million - $310.9 million), due to the expected decrease in cash flow in the face of the oil price environment, it said. “At this time, we cannot forecast the duration of the effects of COVID-19 on our business or when international prices for crude oil and refined products will stabilize,” the company said. “Our future business results will be affected by the extent and duration of these conditions and the effectiveness of responsive actions that we and others take,” it added.

The company is closely monitoring the effects of the virus on crude demand, Chief Executive Felipe Bayon said in an interview with Reuters in New York, and added China has not cut back purchases of its crude yet. Oil prices have slumped more than 20% this year to multi-year lows as the coronavirus threatens to erode global crude demand. The outbreak of the virus has already killed more than 3,000 people and roiled global financial markets. World Health Organization (WHO) chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said almost eight times as many cases had been reported outside China as inside in the previous 24 hours, adding the risk of coronavirus spreading was now very high at a global level. About 46% of Ecopetrol’s crude exports were shipped to Asia in 2019, Bayon said, the majority of that sold to China. In the fourth quarter, shipments to Asia represented about 54% of exports. “The Chinese refineries see us as part of the base load which is good. So we haven’t seen an impact in terms of volumes,” Bayon said. “We have a combinations of terms. We have long-term contracts with some of the refineries and we have spot shipments as well.” Ecopetrol produces a majority of Colombia’s oil. The country’s daily production averaged 885,851 bpd in 2019, and the government has said it expects crude output to rise to between 890,000 and 900,000 bpd this year. Steps the company can take if prices continue to slide and China cuts back purchases include potentially increasing crude processing at its domestic refineries and shipping crude to alternative destinations such as the United States, Bayon said. Ecopetrol could also postpone or stop some investments that are discretionary and will not affect growth, he said. “God forbid that prices drop to $30 or $40 a barrel, we need to be ready to pull those levers and we are ready,” he said. Oil prices rose more than 4% on Monday, the first gain after six sessions of losses. Brent crude futures gained $2.23, or 4.5%, to settle at $51.90 a barrel. The session low of $48.40 was its lowest since July 2017. “I was expecting prices to drop today. It’s a bit crazy,” Bayon said. Break-even prices for the company are currently at about $29 a barrel, allowing the company some flexibility, Bayon said.

About 46% of Ecopetrol’s crude exports were shipped to Asia in 2019, Bayon said, the majority of that sold to China. In the fourth quarter, shipments to Asia represented about 54% of exports. “The Chinese refineries see us as part of the base load which is good. So we haven’t seen an impact in terms of volumes,” Bayon said. “We have a combinations of terms. We have long-term contracts with some of the refineries and we have spot shipments as well.”"

-38.429937580158665," Colombia's Ecopetrol to increase exploratory wells, roll over debt due in 2020 BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia's state-run oil company Ecopetrol ECO.CN will look to increase the number of exploratory wells it has planned through 2022 to up to 45 in a bid to further bolster reserves, company executives said on Wednesday. Ecopetrol will also roll over $434 million in debt set to expire this year, the executives said. Ecopetrol drilled 20 wells in 2019, the company said in a results filing on Tuesday, above its goal of 12. The wells had a 40% success rate. “We have been more proactive every time from the point of view of exploration,” Chief Executive Felipe Bayon said on a call with investors. “Last year we had a lot of success in the bidding process for (exploration and production) areas, we will keep working on that.” “We are working on having an inventory of potential exploration prospects that is much greater than (the goal of) 30, it could be 40 or 45 wells,” through 2022, Bayon added. Ecopetrol’s net profit in 2019 was 13.3 trillion pesos ($3.87 billion), up 14.7% on the previous year, due to a successful commercial strategy for its heavy crudes, it said on Tuesday. “We will not be cautious from the point of view of exploration,” Bayon said, adding that the company’s 2020-2022 plan will focus on Colombia and on international wells with good prospects. Exploration and better recovery of crude from mature wells took reserve replacement figures to 169% last year, the highest in the last nine years, Bayon added. Jaime Caballero, Ecopetrol’s vice president for finance, said the $434 million debt roll over was advantageous and may involve some form of restructuring. “There could be certain opportunities to improve the cost of debt of the group, taking advantage of circumstances of the market,” Caballero said on the call. “In that sense we are working on the roll over of debt and perhaps in changing some of its components.” Ecopetrol’s healthy profits mirror the success of another regional state-run oil firm. Brazil’s Petrobras posted a record high profit of $9.19 billion for 2019. Mexico’s Pemex, meanwhile, is struggling with an estimated $99 billion in debt. President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador has provided $9.5 billion in support via capital injections, tax breaks and debt refinancing, effectively transferring at least some of the company’s risk to the federal government.

Fourth-quarter net profit rose sharply, by 51.5%, to 4 trillion pesos ($1.16 billion), the company said in a filing with the country’s financial regulator. “2019 was an outstanding year in operational and financial terms for Grupo Ecopetrol,” Chief Executive Felipe Bayon said in the statement. “Our commercial strategy has allowed us to achieve a direct relationship with refiners, making us a trustworthy provider of heavy crude for our clients.” Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization rose 1% in 2019 to 31.1 trillion pesos, Ecopetrol said, while the figure increased 1.9% in the fourth quarter to 7.17 trillion pesos. The company drilled 20 wells in 2019, the statement said, above its goal of 12, and met its 725,000 barrels per day output goal. The company has said it will invest between $4.5 billion and $5.5 billion in 2020, 25% to 53% higher than in 2019. Some 80% of those investments are expected to be focused on upstream activities. Production will reach between 750,000 and 760,000 barrels per day this year, the company has estimated. Earlier this month Ecopetrol said proven reserves increased 9.6% last year, taking total reserves to the equivalent of 7.8 years of production, or 1.89 billion barrels. The company’s 2020-2022 investment plan calls for between $13 billion and $17 billion in spending, Tuesday’s statement added. The investment will be directed toward maintaining the increase in reserves and production and looking into opportunities to diversify the company’s portfolio. The three-year plan aims for output of between 745,000 and 800,000 barrels per day.

Ecopetrol closed 2019 with 1.89 billion barrels of oil equivalent in proven reserves, also known as 1P reserves, up from 1.73 billion barrels at the end of 2018, it said in a statement. In 2019 Ecopetrol produced 242 million barrels of oil equivalent but added 408 million barrels in 1P reserves. For every barrel produced, the company replaced it with 1.69 barrels, the highest replacement ratio in the last nine years, Ecopetrol added. Of the added reserves 60% came as a result of technical management and financial optimization of the company’s assets, as well as investment in new projects, Ecopetrol said. Another 164 million barrels of oil equivalent came from the development of unconventional deposits in the U.S. Permian Basin in partnership with Occidental Petroleum Corp. The company said crude made up 73% of its total proven reserves, equivalent to some 7.2 years, with gas accounting for the remaining 27% of reserves, or 10.4 years of production."

The attack took place on Tuesday afternoon in Toledo municipality in Norte de Santander province, which borders Venezuela, Ecopetrol pipeline subsidiary Cenit said in a statement on Wednesday. “The attack produced a rupture in the pipeline, a fire and the falling of crude into the La Petra ravine and the Sararito and Margua rivers,” Cenit said. There were 71 attacks on Colombian pipelines in 2019, down 33.6% from the year before. The 480-mile (770-km) Cano Limon is a top target for bombings; it has suffered eight attacks so far this year and weathered 42 in 2019, according to Ecopetrol. The attack has not affected exports or work in the Cano Limon oilfield, which is operated by Occidental Petroleum, because crude can also be transported on the mostly underground Bicentenario pipeline. Although Cenit did not name the group responsible for the bombing, an army source in the region said leftist National Liberation Army (ELN) rebels, considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union, were responsible. The 2,000-strong ELN regularly attacks oil infrastructure."

Flares at oil fields pump hundreds of millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere each year, according to the World Bank. The multilateral lender’s initiative aims to stop routine flaring by 2030 as part of a push to fight climate change. Globally, Ecopetrol follows 38 other oil and gas companies and 32 governments in joining the initiative, which was launched by the World Bank in 2015, according to the lender’s website. Within Latin America, the plan is supported by the governments of Ecuador, Mexico and Peru. Petrobras and Petroamazonas EP, the state-owned oil companies of Brazil and Ecuador, respectively, also support the strategy. “We are committed to being leaders in the reduction of greenhouse gases in Colombia and increasing the energy we generate with renewable sources,” Ecopetrol Chief Executive Officer Felipe Bayon said. Signing up to the initiative is part of Ecopetrol’s commitment to cut its emissions by 20% by 2030, a plan it announced in 2019. The company will commit to not burning gas flares at new oil fields and will stop routine flaring in existing fields as soon as possible. It will also report the annual volume of gas it burns to the Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership, which supports efforts to reduce gas flaring."

The LLA 124 block initially received two bids in the first round of the auction, from the consortium and Canada’s Parex. The auction is the Andean country’s second this year. Parex submitted a new bid for the block during a counter-offer period earlier this month, but the consortium matched the new bid and won the contract. Colombia has inked 31 contracts this year in a push to boost its oil and gas sector. The head of the country’s national hydrocarbons agency said earlier this month the contracts will bring radical change to Colombia’s hydrocarbon industry. Last year Colombia’s crude reserves rose 9.9% to 1.96 billion barrels, equivalent to 6.2 years of output. The government wants to increase reserves to at least 10 years’ equivalent. Average oil production is about 860,000 barrels per day, of which half is exported."

6.524654587065215," Colombian oil company Ecopetrol may spend up to $5 billion this year BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia’s state-run oil company Ecopetrol said on Wednesday its investment spending this year could reach between $4.4 billion and $5 billion, including projects in the United States and Brazil. The figure is more than the original organic investment projection of $3.5 billion to $4 billion for this year by the company, which has ambitious plans to boost production and exploration to replenish dwindling oil reserves. Organic investments will total up to $3.9 billion during 2019, Chief Executive Felipe Bayon said during a call with investors, while spending on the Gato do Mato project in Brazil and in a joint venture with Occidental Petroleum Corp in the Permian Basin in the United States will contribute the rest. “We do see an increase in capex, we see it from the point of view of what we have today in cash, in our financial situation,” Bayon said. “We had said in last year’s plan that we should be between $12 billion and $15 billion during 2019 to 2021, which is an average of $4 to $5 billion (per year), so eventually we are going to see a small increase but when we have a defined plan we will communicate it,” he added. Ecopetrol’s third-quarter results released on Tuesday showed that the company had invested $2.32 billion up to the end of September, with just over 80% focused on exploration and production. But a presentation on Wednesday showed Ecopetrol will invest between $1.2 and $1.6 billion during the fourth quarter, taking the company to within its original investment target. The presentation showed that the Brazil and U.S. investments will get an additional $900 million to $1.1 billion in spending. The company has said its Occidental joint venture will allow it to develop the capabilities it needs to possibly tap shale deposits in Colombia. Ecopetrol will participate in fracking pilot projects it says are set to start in the second half of 2020. The company’s third-quarter net profit rose 8.5% to about $890 billion because of a favorable exchange rate and despite a fall in crude prices. Crude production during the quarter fell 0.7% to 720,000 barrels per day (bpd), Ecopetrol said, putting it just within the target range of 720,000 to 730,000 bpd. But Bayon assured investors fourth quarter production is set to rise to between 734,000 and 740,000 bpd. Ecopetrol perforated 13 new oil wells through September, operational vice president Alberto Consuegra said, and hopes to finish the year with 17, five more than planned."

5.758679513241841," Colombia's Ecopetrol says third quarter profit rose 8.5% to $890 billion BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia’s state-run oil company Ecopetrol said on Tuesday its third quarter net profit rose 8.5% to 3.01 trillion pesos ($890 billion) from the year-ago quarter because of a more favorable exchange rate and despite a fall in crude prices. “The results are principally a reflection of our good operational performance in all areas and of the commercial positioning of our crude in markets that generate higher values,” Chief Executive Officer Felipe Bayon said in a statement to the Colombian financial regulator. “Add to that the better average exchange rate, financial savings associated with the pre-payment of debt and lower tax rates,” Bayon said. Good returns have allowed the company to compensate for lower crude prices, Bayon said. The Colombian peso fell 8% against the dollar during the third quarter. Ecopetrol has said it will invest $3.5 billion to $4 billion in 2019, more than the previous year, as part of an ambitious plan to boost production and exploration to replenish dwindling oil reserves. The company had invested $2.32 billion through the end of September, just over 80% focused on exploration and production, the company said. Ecopetrol fared better in the third quarter than other state-run oil companies in Latin America, including Mexico’s Pemex and Brazil’s Petrobras. Pemex on Monday posted a net loss of some $4.4 billion during the quarter, but said it had reduced its large debt. Petrobras last week reported a third quarter net income fall of 51.8% from the previous quarter to $2.25 billion, because of already announced one-off charges, some of which pertained to arbitral and legal disputes. Ecopetrol’s earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization between July and September rose 3.4% in the quarter from the same period in 2018, to 8.27 trillion pesos. Crude production during the quarter fell 0.7% to 720,000 barrels per day (bpd) Ecopetrol said, putting it just within the 2019 target output of between 720,000 and 730,000 bpd. Production was down because of “operational limitations” which temporarily shuttered three oilfields, the statement said. Ecopetrol is hit by regular pipeline bombings attributed to leftist rebels. A recent decision by a Colombian tribunal to allow investigative fracking pilot projects is an opportunity to rigorously evaluate the possibility of using the technique, the statement said. Bayon and other executives are set to discuss the results with investors on Wednesday."

20.975486871529032," Colombia fracking pilots could start in late 2020: Ecopetrol CEO NEW YORK (Reuters) - Colombia’s state-run oil company Ecopetrol will be ready to start fracking pilot projects in the second half of 2020, chief executive Felipe Bayon said on Wednesday, as oil companies await federal regulatory guidelines for the projects. The pilots are part of the Andean country’s efforts to determine whether hydraulic fracturing, which breaks up rock formations with pressurized liquid, will be allowed. Fracking, which environmental activists blame for water contamination, is the subject of an ongoing lawsuit in the country’s top administrative court, which has ruled that pilot programs can go ahead while the case proceeds. Ecopetrol is a co-defendant in the suit. Four projects could bring in $5 billion annually in investment once they are producing oil, industry leaders said on Tuesday. Supporters consider fracking key to Colombia’s energy self-sufficiency. The country currently produces about 860,000 bpd of oil. Bayon said there could be more than four projects undertaken. “I think in the second half of next year, we will be ready to start drilling,” Bayon told Reuters in an interview in New York. “The ministry is working on the protocols. They’ll take some months, those will come out, and then we can apply for the licenses.” Bayon declined to specify which companies Ecopetrol might work with on the projects. In addition to current partners, new entrants may be possible. “There are a lot of companies that are not currently in Colombia doing unconventionals that would like to be in Colombia,” he said. “We have several pilots that we are looking at.” Bayon would not specify the exact locations of the projects, for fear of encouraging land speculation in surrounding areas. “This is not about us rushing it, this is about doing it well. This could be the next 20 to 30 years of energy security,” he said. Spending on the projects will come from the $500 million the company has already earmarked for development of non-conventional deposits, he said. Ecopetrol’s joint venture with Occidental Petroleum Corp in Texas’ Permian Basin will allow the company to develop the capabilities it needs for tapping shale deposits in Colombia in the future, he said. “We are going to be teaching (people), create capability and some of them will help deepen our capability as we go back to Colombia,” he said."

Net profit in the first half rose 1.6% compared with the first half of 2018 to 6.23 trillion pesos, the company said in a statement to the country’s financial regulator. The results show “financial and operational strength” in the face of challenges, Chief Executive Felipe Bayon said in the statement. “The financial results for this period continue to be impacted unfavorably by the international price environment, principally naphtha and gasoline, combined with the appreciation of heavy crude that serves our refineries.” Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization fell 3.5% in the quarter which ended in June from the same period in 2018, to 8.3 trillion pesos. Crude production rose in the first half to 726,000 barrels per day (bpd), Ecopetrol said, from 711,000 bpd in the first half of 2018. That met its 2019 target output of between 720,000 and 730,000 bpd. Ecopetrol has said it will invest $3.5 billion to $4 billion in 2019, more than the previous year, as part of an ambitious plan to boost production and exploration to replenish dwindling oil reserves. But Ecopetrol invested just $1.39 billion between January and June, according to Monday’s statement. Some 80% of the investment will be focused on upstream projects, mostly in Colombia, Ecopetrol has said, while another portion will be spent in the United States, Brazil and Mexico. In July Ecopetrol announced it had formed a drilling partnership with Occidental Petroleum Corp to develop its acreage in the Midland portion of the Permian shale field for up to $1.5 billion. Ecopetrol’s efforts to invest some $500 million in exploration of unconventional deposits hit a snag last month when Colombia’s environmental authority suspended its evaluation of the company’s request to start a fracking pilot project until an administrative court reinstates rules for tapping unconventional deposits.

The company and its transport subsidiary Cenit said in a statement the “deliberate” fire began close to 5 a.m. local time (1000 GMT) at a storage area in Arauquita municipality. A blockade in the area was preventing the entrance of firefighters and technical staff, the statement added, putting local communities and workers at risk. Ecopetrol did not clarify where the blockade was taking place or who was conducting it. The storage pools are used on a temporary basis to store crude drained from the Cano Limon pipeline after frequent bomb attacks. The pipeline has been hit 25 times this year, Ecopetrol said, 15 of which have taken place in Arauca, which borders Venezuela. Extractive projects in Colombia regularly face protests and security threats, including bomb attacks attributed to the leftist National Liberation Army (ELN) rebels.

-8.568430248788749," Ecopetrol's plan for fracking project hits new snag in Colombia BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia’s environmental authority said on Friday that it was suspending its evaluation of Ecopetrol’s request to start a fracking pilot project until an administrative court reinstates rules for tapping unconventional crude deposits. The decision was a new snag in the state-owned oil company’s plan to spend $500 million on exploring unconventional deposits. Last year, the Council of State - tasked with ruling on administrative matters - decided to suspend regulations for tapping unconventional deposits, typically shale formations that contain oil and gas. While the court holds hearings on the regulations, the National Authority for Environmental Licenses (ANLA) will suspend its evaluation of Ecopetrol’s request for an environmental license for the massive unconventional crude deposit Guane-A, ANLA said in a statement. The decision will likely mean a longer wait if and when the Council of State authorizes the regulations. Fracking, or hydraulic fracturing, is not yet in use in Colombia. But President Ivan Duque supports exploring whether fracking can help boost the country’s oil reserves without polluting the environment. The process faces stiff opposition form left-leaning lawmakers, community leaders and environmentalists. Colombia produced an average of 865,127 barrels per day in 2018, and has between 3 billion and 9 billion barrels of oil equivalent in unconventional deposits, according to the government. Fracking could nearly triple Colombia’s reserves of crude and gas, the government has said."

The two companies own equal stakes in the contracts. The COR 9 block in southeastern Colombia, which Holol will operate on its own, requires a $16 million investment, it added. Holol won the contracts during an auction last month, part of a series of bidding rounds by the state hydrocarbon agency aimed at revitalizing Colombia’s long-stagnant oil sector and generating $1.5 billion in investments in coming months. The country’s crude reserves were up 9.9% last year to 1.96 billion barrels, or equivalent to 6.2 years of output. The government wants to increase reserves to at least 10 years equivalent."

About 71% of cost reductions will be focused in exploration and production, Ecopetrol said in a statement. Another 10% will come from the downstream area, 8% from commercial, 6% from midstream and another 5% between digital and corporate areas, it said. The new goals are included in the savings plan it announced for 2019-2021, though it did not say how much. The cost reductions come after Ecopetrol reported structural efficiencies worth 10.2 trillion pesos between 2015 and the first quarter of this year. Ecopetrol has said it will invest between $3.5 billion and $4 billion in 2019, slightly above last year as it bolsters spending on exploration and production projects. Some 80% of the investment will be focused in upstream projects, mostly in Colombia, it has said, while another portion will be spent in the United States, Brazil and Mexico. The investment is the backbone of an ambitious plan to boost production and explore for more oil to replenish dwindling reserves. The company has said it will drill 700 wells and double the number of rigs in operation last year. Ecopetrol said in May its first-quarter net profit was 2.75 trillion pesos, 5% higher than in 2018, helped by an increase in output, sales and greater operating efficiencies. It expects 2019 output to reach between 720,000 and 730,000 bpd equivalent. (Reporting by Helen Murphy; Editing by Dan Grebler)"

Frontera Energy, Geopark, Ecopetrol, Hocol, Parex Resources, Gran Tierra Energy and ONGC Videsh have put in a total of 19 offers, the national hydrocarbons agency said. Ten of the blocks are onshore and one is offshore. At least 22 companies were qualified to bid on 20 blocks on offer in the auction. Results of the bidding are expected in mid-July. “For the first time in the history of Colombia an offer of blocks has obtained 55% success,” said agency head Luis Miguel Morelli. Qualified companies which did not bid will have access to competitors’ offers and can present alternative ones, Morelli said. Other qualified bidders include CNE Oil and Gas, Occidental Petroleum, Hunt Overseas Oil Company, Amerisur Exploracion, Mansarovar Energy and Noble Energy. State-run Ecopetrol and its subsidiary Hocol put in the best bids on five of the 11 blocks, Ecopetrol said in a statement later on Tuesday. Ecopetrol bid for the offshore GuaOff-10 block, it said, while Hocol placed a bid on the COR-9 block. Hocol also bid on the LLA 86, 87 and 104 blocks in partnership with Geopark. “The best offers presented today in Bogota put Grupo Ecopetrol in first place for eligibility in this phase of the process,” the statement said. Colombia expects to receive some $1.5 billion in oil investment over the coming months from this round of bidding as well as a recently launched permanent bidding process, Morelli has said. The government hopes the new process and modified contractual terms for offshore exploration will boost its long-stagnant oil sector. Offshore and onshore exploration ground to a halt when global prices slumped. Companies including Royal Dutch Shell, Noble, Exxon, Repsol and Parex have already signed on to operate new blocks this year. The country’s crude reserves were up 9.9% last year to 1.96 billion barrels, or equivalent to 6.2 years of output. The government wants to increase reserves to at least 10 years equivalent. Average oil production is 865,000 barrels per day, half of which is exported. Ecopetrol said last month its crude exports to the United States rose nearly 25% in the first quarter because of lower supply from neighboring Venezuela and higher production."

Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization were up 2.9 percent in the three-month period compared with the year before, to 7.4 trillion pesos, the company said in a filing with the country’s financial regulator. Ecopetrol said the results were achieved even with lower Brent oil prices, which went from $67.2 dollars per barrel in the first quarter of 2018 to $63.8 per barrel at the close of the first quarter of 2019. “The result reflects the positive response of deposits with primary and secondary recovery, the development of gas markets, and the effective implementation of investments,” Ecopetrol’s President Felipe Bayon said in a statement. “During the first quarter of the year we had a favorable macroeconomic environment, where a higher exchange rate, a lower effective tax rate and greater savings in financial expenses allowed (the company) to compensate the lower price of Brent,” he said. Ecopetrol has said it will invest between $3.5 billion and $4 billion in 2019, more than its spending in 2018, as part of an ambitious plan to boost production and explore for more oil to replenish dwindling reserves. Some 80 percent of the investment will be focused in upstream projects, mostly in Colombia, it has said, while another portion will be spent in the United States, Brazil and Mexico.

-13.621611503771804," Ecopetrol to spend $500 million on fracking over three years: CEO NEW YORK (Reuters) - Colombia’s state-run oil company Ecopetrol SA is looking to spend $500 million in exploring unconventional deposits over the next three years, its chief executive said on Tuesday, starting with pilot programs in the Magdalena Medio region. “We’ve applied for some licenses, we will apply for more... roughly 20 wells that will need to be drilled, fracked, cored, lobed, there’s lots of activity, so there’s quite a bit of investment,” Ecopetrol’s Chief Executive Felipe Bayon told Reuters in an interview. The proposed $500 million is part of the $12 billion to $15 billion allocated by Ecopetrol to investing between 2019 and 2021, said Bayon, adding that these pilot programs would involve participation of nearby communities as well as regulators, authorities and unions. “The advantage of the pilots is it’s like having a fish bowl you know everybody can look into and be comfortable with what’s being done.” Some local communities and many environmentalists in Colombia are opposed to the controversial use of hydraulic fracturing, known as fracking, technology which breaks rock formations with pressurized liquid. Its use is credited for booming oil and gas production in the United States, but environmental activist have blamed it for water pollution. A commission of experts last month issued non-binding recommendations regarding monitoring of these pilot programs and the future use of fracking in Colombia. “It’s fundamental that we incorporate the recommendations from the expert commission,” Bayon said. “We hope that we can demonstrate through the pilots that this can be done responsibly and safely and with the use of the highest worldwide standards.” Bayon said this year’s budget incorporates an estimated price of $65 per barrel of oil, “but all of our investments are tested at $55.” U.S. crude futures have averaged roughly $53.40 so far this year. “I can confirm we are reviewing if we (will) do tactical hedging for specific commercial deals,” he said, without giving more details. Looking beyond the investment in unconventional deposits, the oil company said it will try to fill the void left by Venezuela as U.S. sanctions on its oil company have triggered a scarcity of heavy crude in the Atlantic basin. Bayon said about $1 billion will be deployed in projects including six wells around the tight sands and naturally fractured reservoirs in the Magdalena Medio, five to 12 wells looking for gas onshore near the Caribbean coast and about six more offshore wells. Ecopetrol will also look to sign more exploration and production contracts this year both in Colombia and abroad. “We’re actively looking to continue to strengthen the partnerships that we have, both inside Colombia and internationally,” Bayon said. The company closed a deal with Royal Dutch Shell and Chevron Corp last December after winning a block in a September auction as part of a consortium with BP and CNOOC, both for exploration in Brazil. The company has had to deal with at least a dozen pipeline attacks, usually attributed to leftist guerrillas, so far this year. However, Bayon said, they have had no deferral in production as they have been able to use alternative routes to take the oil to port. “We spent between $30 (million) and $40 million repairing the pipelines last year. That’s money that we could have invested somewhere else, either in our business or social development.”"

The country recently modified its bidding system for offshore oil and gas exploration contracts and relaunched bidding for more than 20 possible production areas. The government, which last held an auction in 2014, repeatedly postponed bidding that had been set to take place last year because of company requests to change contract specifications. “Ecopetrol will invest more than $250 million in this offshore project,” Luis Miguel Morelli, the head of the National Hydrocarbons Agency, said in a statement, adding the deal was signed on March 1. The company will mount at least two exploratory wells, the statement said, and is optimistic the bloc will yield gas reserves in the medium term. The company said in its own statement it was planning to seek a partner for exploration and production in the bloc. Ecopetrol currently operates in five offshore blocs.

The insurgent group, which frequently attacks the pipeline, has around 2,000 fighters and opposes oil and mining activities by multinational companies, saying they take advantage of natural resources without benefiting Colombians. President Ivan Duque, who took office in August, has said he will not continue peace talks with the ELN initiated by his predecessor until the rebels stop kidnappings and all criminal activity."
9.973894008545912," Colombia's Ecopetrol sets 2019 investment at $3.5-$4 billion BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombian state-run oil company Ecopetrol said on Tuesday it will invest between $3.5 billion and $4 billion in 2019, slightly above this year as it bolsters spending on exploration and production projects. The investment is the backbone of an ambitious plan to boost production and explore for more oil to replenish dwindling reserves. The company has said it will drill 700 wells and double the number of rigs in operation this year. Ecopetrol expects output next year at between 720,000 and 730,000 barrels per day equivalent, Ecopetrol said in a statement, slightly above the 715,000 to 725,000 bpd targeted this year. Spending on exploration will increase to about $460 million in 2019 from $250 million in 2018, it said. Some 80 percent of the investment will be focused in upstream projects, mostly in Colombia, the statement said. Another 8 percent will go toward the positioning the company in the United States, Brazil and Mexico. The company said recently it still plans to reach $3 billion to $3.5 billion in investments in 2018, though it had spent just $1.79 billion through the third quarter. Ecopetrol has been working to lessen the effects of local protests, which temporarily shuttered three fields in February. It had cut its investment forecast for 2018 from $3.5 billion-$4 billion in August because of the protests and other spending delays. Output has so far not been affected by nearly continuous attacks on the Cano Limon-Covenas pipeline from the National Liberation Army, a leftist guerilla group, it has said. The pipeline, which can transport up to 210,000 bpd, has been offline for much of this year because of bombings and illegal taps. Production from the Cano Limon field, operated by Occidental Petroleum Corp, has been routed through a different pipeline. Ecopetrol has reserves equivalent to about seven years of production, well below the average of nearly 12 years for the world’s top oil and gas companies."
5.9389856877561575," Colombia's Cano Limon oil pipeline attacked, oil threatens waterways BOGOTA, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Colombian state oil company Ecopetrol on Thursday rushed to stop an oil spill that threatens to pollute waterways in northeastern Colombia, after a new attack on the Cano Limon-Covenas pipeline, the company and military authorities said. The pipeline was hit on Wednesday by an explosion in the rural area of Cubara, in Boyaca province, an Ecopetrol representative told Reuters. The explosion did not affect exports or pumping in the Cano Limon oil field in northern Arauca province since its operator, Occidental Petroleum, is currently using Ecopetrol’s Bicentenario pipeline to transport some 50,000 barrels per day of crude. Even though the 773-kilometer (480-mile) Cano Limon pipeline has been out of operation since Aug. 25, the attack caused crude oil to spill into the surrounding area, threatening waterways. The Cano Limon pipeline has capacity to transport up to 210,000 barrels per day of crude oil. Military authorities in the region, who asked not to be identified, attributed the attack to guerrillas of the National Liberation Army (ELN), considered a terrorist organization by the United States and the European Union. The insurgent group, which frequently attacks the pipeline, has around 2,000 fighters and opposes oil and mining activities by multinational companies, saying they take advantage of natural resources without benefiting Colombians. The Cano Limon-Covenas pipeline has been the target of 83 attacks so far this year, more than the 62 in all of 2017, according to Ecopetrol. The pipeline has been shut 277 days this year. President Ivan Duque, who took office in August, has said he will not continue peace talks with the ELN - initiated by his predecessor Juan Manuel Santos - until the rebels stop kidnappings and all criminal activity.

-6.689795922788594," Colombia's Cano Limon pipeline hit by three more bombings BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombian state-run oil company Ecopetrol said on Tuesday that three new bombings of the Cano Limon pipeline have caused contamination in several waterways in the country’s northeastern Arauca province. The attacks on Sunday and Monday brought total bombings of the 485-mile (780-km) pipeline to 82 this year. Cano Limon, which can transport up to 210,000 barrels of oil per day, has been out of service for much of 2018 because of bombings and illegal taps and was not functioning at the time of the latest attacks. It was also bombed on Saturday. The regular bombings have not affected exports or production at the Cano Limon field, operated by Occidental Petroleum Corp, because crude is being moved through the nearby Bicentenario pipeline. The latest attacks sent oil spilling into nearby waterways and the company has alerted towns to possible water contamination, Ecopetrol said. The company does not often name the group it holds responsible for the bombings, but military sources cited fighters from the National Liberation Army (ELN) rebel group. ELN, considered a terrorist group by the United States and the European Union, has about 1,500 combatants and opposes multinational companies that its leaders accuse of seizing natural resources without benefiting Colombians. Colombian President Ivan Duque has demanded the group free all of its hostages and cease criminal activities before he will consider restarting peace talks that began last year under his predecessor, Juan Manuel Santos."

The pipeline, which can transport up to 210,000 barrels per day, was not functioning at the time of the attack, which followed one on Oct. 24. Cleanup personnel will begin work on close to a kilometer of contaminated water in a canal in Canaguata, in Boyaca province, as soon as the army deems it safe, the company said. The fire in a nearby section of forest continues to burn, sending black columns of smoke skyward, a video released by Ecopetrol showed. The regular bombings have not affected exports or production at the Cano Limon field, operated by Occidental Petroleum, because crude can be moved through a second, nearby pipeline.

The spending is the backbone of an ambitious plan to boost production and explore for more oil to replenish dwindling reserves. The company has said it will drill 620 wells and double the number of rigs in operation this year. Ecopetrol still plans to reach $3 billion to $3.5 billion in investments this year, though it had spent just $1.79 billion through the third quarter, executives said on an investor call after the company released third-quarter results on Wednesday. “We need to keep doing more work internally, but the idea is that we will be in that range of $3 to $3.5 billion for this year. It’s the range with which we’ll possibly enter next year and which in some way denotes stability in operations,” CEO Felipe Bayon said. Ecopetrol’s board is still in the process of approving that investment for 2019, a spokesman said. The company is working to lessen the effects of social protests, which temporarily shuttered three fields in February and kept the first-quarter investment to just over $400 million, Chief Financial Officer Jaime Caballero said on the call. “We are implementing initiatives to quickly execute projects and to mitigate the impact of the social and environmental contingencies that materialized in the first half of the year,” Caballero said. The company had cut its investment forecast for 2018 from $3.5 billion to $4 billion in August because of the protests and other spending delays. Net profit jumped 177 percent to more than $866 million in the third quarter, while consolidated oil and gas production climbed to 724,000 barrels per day (bpd), just under the company’s 725,000-bpd goal for the year.

-21.981820132798305," Ecopetrol seeks license to starts fracking tests in Colombia BARRANCABERMEJA, Colombia (Reuters) - Colombia’s state oil company Ecopetrol has requested an environmental license to launch a pilot plan to explore for crude oil from unconventional deposits using fracking technology, its chief executive said. Felipe Bayon told Reuters late on Friday the plan, which could triple Colombia’s proven reserves, would be supervised by local communities and environmentalists to ensure it meets safety standards. Colombia does not currently carry out oil exploration or exploitation activities with fracking, but President Ivan Duque favors the technique, used to extract oil and gas from unconventional deposits in rock formations that do not allow the movement of fluid. Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, technology fractures rock formations with pressurized liquid. Its use is credited for booming oil and gas production in the United States, but environmental activist have blamed it for water pollution. Local communities and environmentalists in Colombia have opposed the technology. If the permit is granted the pilot would begin in the coming months in Magdalena Medio, an area where the La Luna and Tablazo geological formations converge and which could have between 2 billion to 7 billion barrels of oil, Bayon said during a visit to the Barrancabermeja refinery in central Colombia. This would triple the nation’s reserves. Colombia has 1.78 billion barrels of proven reserves of crude. “The Magdalena Medio zone has a potential to be determined, but it could continue to help the country’s energy security and self-supply,” he said. Bayon declined to say how much money would be invested in the pilot. Colombia, which produced 854,121 barrels of oil per day in 2017, was hurt in recent years by the drop in international oil prices, hitting hard at the economy."

Ecopetrol said production at wells had not been affected, though 19 drilling rigs had been halted. Those striking are all employed by contractors, the company and union said. Ecopetrol has 9,000 direct employees nationally, while its contractors employ some 25,000 people. The Petroleum Industry Workers Union (USO) said some 2,300 workers were participating in the strike, which began at 6 a.m. local time and is set to last 24 hours. USO is in the midst of contract talks with Ecopetrol after its salary and benefits agreement expired in June. That deal remains valid until a new one is signed. The union has 18,000 members across the Andean nation, whose top export is oil, and is planning a series of strikes around the country ahead of a Sept. 22 deadline for the new deal. If no deal has been reached by that date, the union can go to arbitration with Ecopetrol or hold a national walk-out, union president Cesar Loza said. “The strike is part of a mobilization plan that the union has. Later we’ll be holding other mobilization actions in refineries and at pipelines, depending on advances at the negotiating table,” he said, adding the union did not want to go to arbitration. Ecopetrol said in a statement it rejected the strike. “The union also promoted blockades in different access points where direct employees of Ecopetrol and contractors who work at the field travel,” the company added. La Cira-Infantas, in central Santander province, has an average daily production of 45,000 barrels, Ecopetrol said. (Reporting by Julia Symmes Cobb and Nelson Bocanegra Editing by James Dalgleish)"

-15.429867525527282," Ecopetrol to focus spending on drilling for rest of year: CEO NEW YORK (Reuters) - Colombia’s state-run oil company Ecopetrol SA will focus spending for the rest of the year on increased drilling activity and securing operational licenses, its chief executive said on Friday. Spending delays earlier this year will make it harder for the company to achieve its 2018 $3 billion to $3.5 billion capital plan, CEO Felipe Bayon said in an interview at the New York Stock Exchange, where company officials observed the 10th anniversary of its NYSE listing. “It’s a challenge” to hit spending targets, Bayon said, adding the company plans to have 41 working rigs at year end, up from 33 at the end of June. Acquiring drilling rights consumes “a lot of the capex we invest,” he said. Last week, Ecopetrol said it will invest $3 billion to $3.5 billion during 2018, below the initial target of up to $4 billion because of spending delays and protests that closed three fields in the first quarter. “It’s never going to be smooth sailing in this industry. There’s always uncertainty, there’s things that are going to hit you that you don’t know.” Ecopetrol faced dozens of attacks on its Cano Limon-Covenas oil pipeline this year by the National Liberation Army (ELN) guerrilla group, military sources previously said. The Cano Limon pipeline is operating now, Bayon said, adding that production impacts this year were marginal due to rerouting the Bicentenario pipeline which connects to the Cano Limon line. Last year, the attacks and pipeline closure led to production losses of more than a million barrels, Bayon said. The company aims to boost reserves through exploration, squeezing more oil from existing wells, drilling in unconventional basins and through acquisitions, he said. Colombia’s reserves are estimated at about 2 billion barrels. Ecopetrol is seeking deals in areas where it already has operations, including Mexico, Brazil, Peru and the United States, he said. “We have a very healthy cash position with 15.8 trillion pesos ($5.3 billion) at the end of the quarter,” Bayon said. “That gives us flexibility if we wanted to invest.” Crude oil production in Colombia reached an average of 860,401 barrels per day (bpd) in July, the Mines and Energy Ministry said this week, up 0.5 percent from the same month a year ago. The spending plans and higher rig counts come as oil prices have recovered since the company cut drilling and shuttered an oil field when it lost more $1 billion in 2015 after oil prices crashed. This summer, oil prices climbed to the highest in 3 1/2 years. “Four years ago we needed $65 per barrel to break even, today we need $35,” Bayon said."

24.890194805687425," RPT-FOCUS-After crisis, Colombia's Ecopetrol spends big to boost output, reserves (Repeats for addional clients with no changes to text) ACACIAS, Colombia July 19 (Reuters) - Splattered with mud, a dozen workers wrestled a drill bit into position on a rain-soaked oil rig platform in central Colombia, readying it for work once the storm passed. The rig, at the Castilla oil field in the wide central plains of Meta province, is one of a fleet deployed by Colombian state-run oil company Ecopetrol under a $3.5-$4 billion investment plan this year to boost production and explore for more oil to replenish dwindling reserves. The company has boosted its investment by more than $1 billion, from $2.2 billion a year earlier, to finance drilling 620 wells in 2018. Ecopetrol is targeting output of 725,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude and gas equivalent by the end of the year, up from about 700,000 now, and the has set a more aggressive target of 870,000 bpd by 2020. Castilla, Ecopetrol’s most profitable oil field, is pumping about 115,000 bpd but should approach 125,000 by the end of next year, said Jose Cotello, vice-president for the Orinoquia region in eastern Colombia, which includes Castilla. The expansion would make it the country’s biggest producing field. It pumps heavy oil, which typically sells at a discount to lighter crude that is easier to refine. Right now, however, heavier crude is in demand among refineries worldwide because of a fall in output of similar oil from neighboring Venezuela, where lack of investment has pushed production to its lowest level in decades. Ecopetrol has earmarked $1.1 billion of the investment budget for the Orinoquia region, nearly double the year before, but had to halt drilling for a month because protests closed Castilla and other nearby fields in February. Protesters angered by Ecopetrol’s alleged violations of labor agreements have blocked roads, invaded fields and burned buildings, including a control room. The disruptions led to about $100 million in losses over a month and delayed the start of operations at five wells. “The big question is on drilling, because we were stopped for a month,” Cotello said in an interview after visiting the Castilla field. Nationwide, Ecopetrol will double the number of rigs in operation this year from last. It will operate 28 rigs in the second half of the year, and an additional 25 rigs in joint operations with partners. The number of rigs had dwindled since the oil price crash of 2014-2015. The company is equally focused on finding more oil that it can produce in the future, Cotello said. The reserves on the company’s books have dipped to the equivalent of about 7.1 years of production, according to Ecopetrol. The country’s energy ministry has a less optimistic estimate of 5.6 years. Both are well below the average of nearly 12 years for the world’s top oil and gas companies. Investors look at reserves as a gauge for the long-term sustainability of oil and gas firms. Ecopetrol needed a big boost in spending after several years of underinvestment, said an executive working for an international oil company working in a joint venture with Ecopetrol. Ecopetrol expects to quicken investment in the second half of the year after spending just $405.4 million of the total budget during the first quarter of 2018. The country’s presidential election slowed spending, because anti-corruption laws make it difficult for public companies to open bidding processes for contracts during the electoral process, Ecopetrol said. Colombia’s incoming President Ivan Duque will be inaugurated in August and has promised to help the energy industry. He has said he will invest in the state-run company’s refineries and crack down on militant groups that have attacked oil pipelines. He has also promised tax cuts across the economy, including for the energy industry, although has yet to disclose detailed proposals. Colombia has struggled to attract investment and maintain energy output as conflict, protests and attacks by criminal gangs have frequently interrupted operations. Pumping through the Cano Limon-Covenas oil pipeline restarted last week after 180 days stoppage due to repeated attacks by Marxist ELN rebels, military and industry sources said on Tuesday. The 485-mile-long (780-km) pipeline has been attacked 58 times this year by the National Liberation Army (ELN), the largest active guerrilla group, according to military sources. Although the latest outage was one of the most extensive since the pipeline opened in the mid-1980s, activity in the Cano Limon field, operated by Occidental Petroleum Corp and located in the northern Arauca province, has not been affected. The protests and attacks threaten to slow the momentum the company has gained since stabilizing its finances and reinvesting in production, said Jairo Lastra, investment manager at Lastra Capital Management, who previously worked at the money desk at Ecopetrol. This year’s expanded investment marks a big change for a company that cut drilling and shuttered an oil field when it lost more $1 billion in 2015, after oil prices crashed. The rise in crude prices to 3.5-year highs has given the company the cash it needs to rebuild. Profits rose by more than 300 percent year-on-year in 2017 to more than $2 billion. In the first quarter of this year, Ecopetrol’s profit topped $900 million, executives say. “The crisis is in the rear view mirror,” Cotello said.

24.890194805687425," After crisis, Colombia's Ecopetrol spends big to boost output, reserves ACACIAS, Colombia (Reuters) - Splattered with mud, a dozen workers wrestled a drill bit into position on a rain-soaked oil rig platform in central Colombia, readying it for work once the storm passed. The rig, at the Castilla oil field in the wide central plains of Meta province, is one of a fleet deployed by Colombian state-run oil company Ecopetrol under a $3.5-$4 billion investment plan this year to boost production and explore for more oil to replenish dwindling reserves. The company has boosted its investment by more than $1 billion, from $2.2 billion a year earlier, to finance drilling 620 wells in 2018. Ecopetrol is targeting output of 725,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude and gas equivalent by the end of the year, up from about 700,000 now, and the has set a more aggressive target of 870,000 bpd by 2020. Castilla, Ecopetrol’s most profitable oil field, is pumping about 115,000 bpd but should approach 125,000 by the end of next year, said Jose Cotello, vice-president for the Orinoquia region in eastern Colombia, which includes Castilla. The expansion would make it the country’s biggest producing field. It pumps heavy oil, which typically sells at a discount to lighter crude that is easier to refine. Right now, however, heavier crude is in demand among refineries worldwide because of a fall in output of similar oil from neighboring Venezuela, where lack of investment has pushed production to its lowest level in decades. Ecopetrol has earmarked $1.1 billion of the investment budget for the Orinoquia region, nearly double the year before, but had to halt drilling for a month because protests closed Castilla and other nearby fields in February. Protesters angered by Ecopetrol’s alleged violations of labor agreements have blocked roads, invaded fields and burned buildings, including a control room. The disruptions led to about $100 million in losses over a month and delayed the start of operations at five wells. “The big question is on drilling, because we were stopped for a month,” Cotello said in an interview after visiting the Castilla field. Nationwide, Ecopetrol will double the number of rigs in operation this year from last. It will operate 28 rigs in the second half of the year, and an additional 25 rigs in joint operations with partners. The number of rigs had dwindled since the oil price crash of 2014-2015. The company is equally focused on finding more oil that it can produce in the future, Cotello said. The reserves on the company’s books have dipped to the equivalent of about 7.1 years of production, according to Ecopetrol. The country’s energy ministry has a less optimistic estimate of 5.6 years. Both are well below the average of nearly 12 years for the world’s top oil and gas companies. Investors look at reserves as a gauge for the long-term sustainability of oil and gas firms.

25.620272700720964," Colombia Ecopetrol has no date to restart long-halted Cano Limon pipeline BOGOTA, June 20 (Reuters) - Colombia’s state-run oil company Ecopetrol has no estimate of when pumping will resume on the Cano Limon-Covenas pipeline, which has been halted for 161 days because of bomb attacks and oil theft, the company told Reuters. The 480-mile-long (773-km) pipeline, which has a capacity of up to 220,000 barrels per day, runs from the eastern border with Venezuela to the Caribbean. It has been offline since Jan. 10, the longest stoppage in its history. The pipeline has been attacked 53 times this year in bombings attributed by the military to the National Liberation Army (ELN) rebel group. Apart from bombing damage, 23 illegal valves used to steal crude have been found on the pipeline, the company said. “The restart of pumping will depend on the verification of reported damage and repairs,” Ecopetrol said in response to Reuters questions about the timeline for the re-opening of the pipeline. The company said Ecopetrol and its subsidiary Cenit, which owns the pipeline, have been working nonstop on the problem. The pipeline’s closure has not yet affected production at or exports from the Cano Limon field, operated by Occidental Petroleum Corp and located in the northern Arauca province, Ecopetrol said. Crude from the field is being transported using a smaller pipeline, also at risk of attack. Ecopetrol, which produces around 60 percent of Colombia’s 866,000 barrels a day of oil, said it hopes to restore pumping as soon as possible. “It has never been planned to cease using the pipeline,” Ecopetrol said. “We are the first people interested in returning this system, which is so important for the industry, to normality. We are working without rest in conjunction with the armed forces and the authorities to reach that objective.” The ELN, considered a terrorist group by the United States and European Union, has about 1,500 combatants and opposes multinational companies, claiming they seize natural resources without benefiting Colombians. Outgoing President Juan Manuel Santos and the ELN launched peace negotiations in 2017 but the talks, which shifted from Ecuador to Cuba in May, have been fraught. The guerrillas stepped up their attacks after the end of a bilateral ceasefire in January. President-elect Ivan Duque, who was voted in this week, has said he will halt the talks unless the ELN declares a unilateral ceasefire and concentrates its forces into a single area. Cano Limon has been bombed more than 1,400 times during its 32-year history. The attacks have kept it offline for the equivalent of 11 years and spilled about 2 million barrels of crude.

-3.4857459575073046," Colombia's Ecopetrol boosts output to make up for protest-caused first quarter drop BOGOTA (Reuters) - Ecopetrol, Colombia’s state-run oil company, has accelerated activity at several of its oil fields to make up for a slight output fall in the first quarter, executives said during a call with investors on Friday. The company’s first-quarter net profit rose to 2.6 trillion pesos ($923.3 million), up 195 percent from the same period in 2017, it said on Thursday. However, consolidated oil and gas production in the first quarter fell to 701,000 barrels per day because of February protests that led to blocked roads and the temporary closure of some fields. “To compensate for events in the first quarter, the company has taken a series of measures, including more work at wells and reinforcing activity at the Castillo field with additional perforation equipment,” Rafael Guzman, Ecopetrol’s technical vice president, said on the call. The company is also moving forward a project at the Apiay field, which had been scheduled for 2019, and water injection work at the Chichimene field. Some 150 billion pesos ($52.4 million) in investment meant for the first quarter was stymied by the protests, Finance Vice President Maria Fernanda Suarez said. “During the quarter the public order problems obliged us to move to the second quarter close to 150 billion pesos,” she said. Ecopetrol plans to invest between $3.5 billion and $4 billion in 2018 as it reboots production and exploration after being battered by the global fall in crude prices. It has so far restarted perforation at seven fields, Guzman said, and will directly operate 27 derricks during the second half of the year. ($1 = 2,857.85 Colombian pesos)"
