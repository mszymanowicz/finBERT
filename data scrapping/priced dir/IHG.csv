The move by IHG to shore up its finances comes as the hotel industry faces a plunge in travel demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic, forcing it to adjust its interest cover and leverage ratios and boost efforts to maintain minimum liquidity of $400 million until December 2022.

IHG, whose brands also include the Crowne Plaza, Regent and Hualuxe hotel chains, had posted a 53.4% fall in revenue per available room (RevPAR) in the third quarter, smaller than the 75% drop in the prior quarter.

12.606144079783208," Shares in hoteliers Accor, IHG rise after reported merger interest PARIS (Reuters) - Shares in France's Accor ACCP.PA rallied on Thursday after Le Figaro newspaper reported it had examined a potential merger with British rival InterContinental Hotels (IHG) IHG.L that would create the world's biggest hotel group. The hospitality sector has been hit hard by the coronavirus crisis as travel dwindles, forcing many hotel owners to temporarily halt bookings and shore up their finances. Le Figaro said no formal approach had been made by Accor, which is behind brands such as Ibis and Movenpick, to IHG, which owns Holiday Inn and Crowne Plaza. Based on current prices, a combined firm could have a market value of about $17 billion. Without citing sources, it added Accor’s management board was in favour of a deal, but Accor chairman and CEO Sebastien Bazin, who had set up an internal taskforce on the matter, was more cautious about moving ahead. An Accor spokeswoman said the company did not comment on market rumours. IHG declined to comment. Accor shares were up 1.9%. The company, which faces higher interest payments after it was downgraded to junk status by ratings agency S&P Global earlier this week, has been punished by investors this year, with its shares down over 43% so far. Shares in IHG, down around 23% this year, were up 0.35% at 0825 GMT after surging as much as 3.1% in early trading, outperforming a falling FTSE-100 index. A marriage between the two firms would propel them far ahead of U.S. rival Marriott by number of hotel rooms, with over 1.6 million between the two. It could also make geographical sense, with Accor and its brands more skewed towards Europe, while IHG has larger operations in the United States and is also growing fast in Greater China. Both firms have announced job cuts and cost savings plans in recent weeks as they try to cope with the fallout from the pandemic."

16.399719539827675," Holiday Inn-owner pins hopes on China recovery as virus hits room revenue (Reuters) - Holiday Inn-owner InterContinental Hotels IHG.L said on Thursday it was seeing signs of recovery in some markets as it tightened up on safety and cleaning procedures following an 80% plunge in average room revenue in April. Chief Executive Keith Barr said the coronavirus crisis was the biggest challenge the hotel industry has ever faced and the company said it was cleaning all public areas rigorously every 1-2 hours in a bid to reclaim customer confidence. The Crowne Plaza, Regent and Hualuxe operator is hopeful of a recovery in China, Australia and New Zealand, where the virus is well-contained, as around 95% of its demand is domestically driven. IHG said occupancy levels in Greater China were running in the mid-20% range, up from around 5% in mid-February. It had 10 hotels closed in China at the end of April, compared to a peak of 178 closures earlier. It expects its domestic business to bounce back first, particularly in the United States, where only around 10% of its estate is closed. “We are less exposed to large group meetings and events, which tends to be the first to fall away and the last to recover in a recessionary environment,” Chief Financial Officer Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson told analysts on a conference call. IHG shares, which have fallen around 34% this year, were up 3.3% at 3545 pence by 1106 GMT. Travel and leisure businesses have been among the worst hit by the pandemic, with billions of dollars in business trips and holidays cancelled as countries impose sweeping restrictions. IHG said around 15% of its estate was closed by April-end, with half its hotels in Europe, Middle East, Asia and Africa shut. It expects to open hotels as lockdown measures are eased in different countries. “The group is suffering and until the lockdowns are eased, the pain is likely to continue. It has access to $2 billion in liquidity, so from that point of view it is in good shape,” CMC Markets analyst David Madden said. IHG, which also secured an extension on a $1.28 billion facility until 2023, estimates the $2 billion to provide at least 18 months of headroom. It has waived cancellation fees and created book now pay later options for the rest of 2020. IHG said the occupancy levels dropped to historic lows in March and April, with first-quarter global RevPAR slumping 25%. Earlier this year, it raised 600 million pounds from Bank of England loans under the government’s coronavirus aid scheme and announced $150 million in cost cuts.

IHG, which announced a $150 million in cost cuts last month, said it now had $2 billion in liquidity as it also amended its credit facility to include a waiver of existing covenants until Dec. 31, 2021. Travel and leisure businesses have been among the worst hit by the coronavirus outbreak, with hundred of billions of dollars in business trips and holidays cancelled as countries impose sweeping restrictions. The Crowne Plaza, Regent and Hualuxe operator said around half of its hotels in Europe, Middle East, Asia and Africa are shut, adding that performance in Greater China continues to steadily improve with only 12 out of 470 hotels now closed. In the United States, where half of the company’s hotels are located, around 10% are closed. IHG, which operates more than 5,900 hotels worldwide, with nearly 900,000 rooms across 100 countries, said occupancy levels in comparable open hotels are in the low to mid 20% range across the business.

-31.793989796587514," Coronavirus dents bookings for Holiday Inn owner IHG (Reuters) - InterContinental Hotels IHG.L(IHG) warned on Tuesday that fewer travellers are booking its rooms in China because of the coronavirus outbreak. The owner of the Holiday Inn chain has been highlighted by analysts as among the European companies most directly exposed to the epidemic. The group had begun to see an impact on bookings in late January and has now closed or partially closed 160 of its 470 hotels in Greater China, it said on Tuesday. The company’s annual results on Tuesday showed that revenue per available room (RevPAR) had already declined by 4.5% last year in Greater China while performance in European and U.S. markets was little changed. Based on current disruption the impact equates to about $5 million a month for IHG’s mainland China business, Chief Executive Keith Barr said on an analysts call, describing the decline as “a short-term blip”. Barr added that the region contributes less than 10% of group profit. IHG last month said that up to Feb. 29 it would allow customers to change or cancel stays in mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan at no additional cost. Rival Airbnb last week extended its suspension of bookings in Beijing until April 30. Rival Hilton Worldwide HLT.N has shut roughly 150 hotels in China, which could hit adjusted core profit in the first quarter by between $10 million and $20 million, Chief Executive Christopher J. Nassetta said this month. One yardstick for the impact of the crisis on the company is the previous SARS outbreak, which cut IHG’s RevPAR in the Asia Pacific region by 27% in the three months to June 2003. There is more at stake this time. In 2003 IHG had little more than 40 hotels in China. Now more than 400 of its almost 6,000 hotels worldwide are in Greater China and it is constructing almost as many again. The company has been investing heavily in China, its fastest-growing market, and has revamped rooms at Holiday Inns to woo local business travellers. It plans to open 393 hotels in China and operates four hotels in Wuhan, the centre of the coronavirus outbreak. “It (Greater China) is, though, a smaller part of our business overall, representing 15% of our open rooms and less than 10% of our operating profit,” said IHG finance chief Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson.

The hotel industry in general is feeling the impact of slowing global growth, which is denting business travel. Rival Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc HLT.N warned that lagging growth in China and the China-U.S. trade war would hurt revenue.

Four months of protests in Hong Kong have taken a toll on tourism, while weak economic data from China has been discouraging.

(reut.rs/35Lf0Jl) “While we are certainly not at the stage where business travel has been scaled back on a large scale, the cracks are certainly showing,” AJ Bell’s Investment Director Russ Mould said.

-3.686944170613455," InterContinental plays down impact in China of growing trade tensions (Reuters) - InterContinental Hotels Group IHG.L played down any hit from the trade standoff between Beijing and Washington, saying few of its business customers in China were from outside the country and it was anyway well spread globally to absorb any impact. The owner of brands such as Crowne Plaza, Holiday Inn and Hotel Indigo said on Tuesday its first-half profit rose 14% to $457 million, 11.7% ahead of analyst estimates according to Refinitiv Eikon data. Revenue per available room (RevPAR), a key industry measure, inched up 0.1%, though in Greater China, where IHG operates around 400 hotels, the measure eased 0.3%, which it blamed on a dip in business travel and protests in Hong Kong. IHG has so far been largely insulated from the bruising trade wars, with its operations in China focused on domestic travelers, limiting exposure to international conflicts, the group’s finance chief Paul Edgecliffe-Johnson said. “It’s almost all Chinese travelers staying in Chinese hotels. We’re not seeing any current impact from foreign affairs policy,” Edgecliffe-Johnson said, adding that IHG’s geographical spread protected it from a major hit to any single market. “Our expectations that it (China business) will continue to grow,” Edgecliffe-Johnson said. “Our ability to grow a business out there continues to be really very powerful.” Such assurances contrast with caution among some competitors and an industry group who have warned that escalating trade wars and a slowing world economy were set to dampen spending on business travel and leisure, including in China. (GRAPHIC - IHG looks to China for growth as U.S. stagnates png: tmsnrt.rs/2MIgEUO) Analyst Sophie Lund-Yates at Hargreaves Lansdown noted spending on hotels is one of the first things to be scaled back in the face of economic turbulence. “InterContinental have added another record number of rooms to the portfolio, with the global estate now made up of over 850,000 rooms. That’s certainly impressive, but does of course mean there’s even more rooms to fill,” she said in a note. IHG has focused on affluent Chinese customers to lessen dependence on mature U.S. markets, while rebranding to compete against the likes of Marriott International Inc MAR.O and Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc HLT.N. Last month, Europe's largest hotel group Accor ACCP.PA predicted another record year after a strong quarter, but warned the trade standoff between Washington and Beijing made improvement in China difficult. Hilton also predicted a weaker second half in China and cited the global slowdown as it cut its full-year outlook for a key revenue gauge. IHG shares initially dipped to a one-month low after the results but recovered to be down just 0.7% at 5,251 pence by 1008 GMT. Russ Mould, AJ Bell investment director, said the early reaction was not surprising given the stock was up some 20% on the year. “Demand for its rooms is still linked to the performance of a global economy over which there is mounting concern,” Mould said in a note.

IHG relies heavily on corporate demand but has been slow to adjust to the changing travel landscape as holidaymakers and business travellers increasingly opt for cheaper accommodation offered by the likes of Airbnb and HomeAway. The group’s U.S. operations registered a 0.5 percent decline in the key hotel industry metric, with the company citing unfavourable comparison with the same period last year, when demand was boosted by three hurricanes. IHG, which owns the Crowne-Plaza and Holiday Inn brands among others, posted a 1 percent rise in third-quarter global revenue per available room, well short of the 6 percent growth reported by French rival AccorHotels ACCP.PA on Thursday. “Having been behind the wider sector in terms of new openings earlier in the cycle, the worry is that IHG is playing catch-up just as the market starts to cool,” said Hargreaves Lansdown equities analyst Nicholas Hyett. IHG shares were down 5.8 percent at 1000 GMT, with sentiment apparently unaffected by an announcement that it would return $500 million to shareholders through a special dividend by the first-quarter of 2019. Revenue per available room in Greater China was up 4.8 percent as new rooms openings lifted its capacity in the country to 19,000 rooms, up 70 percent from a year earlier. As well as seeking to expand its offering for affluent Chinese customers, IHG has also undertaken a number rebranding initiatives to compete against the likes of Marriott MAR.O and Hilton HLT.N, which have sprawling luxury portfolios including the Ritz-Carlton, St. Regis, Waldorf Astoria and DoubleTree. The company said it was on course to save $125 million a year by 2020 to fund several growth initiatives. It has said savings will be made by strengthening its franchisee model, investing in automation and promoting loyalty programmes to attract wealthier customers."

The FTSE 100 reversed earlier gains and was down 0.3 percent by 0926 GMT. Still, the market looked likely to mark a rise for the week, having recouped some of the ground lost in last week’s dramatic sell-off. The FTSE outperformed European stocks thanks to its big weighting to high-dividend-yielding stocks, which investors flock to in times of economic uncertainty. Oil majors BP and Shell helped stem the losses as crude prices climbed. With earnings season in full swing, investor sentiment has grown increasingly gloomy this week, with few examples to give much cheer. Topping the FTSE 100 losers, InterContinental’s weaker-than-expected revenue added to the downbeat mood and stirred concerns about the cooling travel sector, even after the hotel chain said it would return 500 million euro ($572 million) to shareholders through a special dividend. Its shares were down 6.5 percent after hitting their lowest in more than a year. “Revenue per available rooms is a little lower than hoped for, largely as a result of weak occupancy numbers in the U.S.,” said Nicholas Hyett, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. “With IHG rapidly expanding its rate of room growth, including some sizeable acquisitions and new brand launches, lower revenues are far from welcome.” Broker moves drove other shares. Easyjet was the second-biggest faller, down 6.4 percent, after a MainFirst downgrade. Dechra Pharmaceuticals was one of only a few gainers on the mid-cap FTSE 250 after Stifel upgraded the stock to buy. Otherwise weak earnings took centre stage on the domestically focused index, which was down 0.7 percent and looked set for its fourth straight weekly loss. Industrials were the biggest drag. Precision engineering group Renishaw Plc topped the loser board, hitting its lowest level in more than a year and down 6.8 percent after a trading statement.

-7.875950478792748," IHG quarterly room revenue growth accelerates on China demand (Reuters) - InterContinental Hotels Group Plc's (IHG) IHG.L second-quarter room revenue growth accelerated on robust demand in China, it said on Tuesday. The operator of the Crowne Plaza, Holiday Inn and Hotel Indigo chains has been focusing on business customers and expanding its luxury offering to cushion the impact of competition from online rental marketplaces such as Airbnb. IHG has also been reducing its ownership of hotels and instead expanding via a cheaper fee model, under which it franchises and manages hotels and has lower capital requirements. The company said it currently has more than 100 Holiday Inn Express hotels under the Franchise Plus model either in the pipeline or open. The model was launched in 2016, tailored for the Chinese market and combining the benefits of a franchise model with those of IHG’s managed model. “This (strong momentum) was led by Greater China, where double digit growth in both RevPAR and net system size, as well as record signings, reflects the ongoing benefits of our long term strategic focus on this important market,” the company said. Comparable revenue per available room (RevPAR) in Greater China grew 9.3 percent in the three months to June 30, compared with 4.4 percent a year earlier. IHG, which traces its history back to 1777, had also benefited from higher corporate demand and occupancies earlier in the year from the Chinese New Year. However, analysts have cautioned about IHG’s growth in the United States, its largest market in terms of room numbers. Quarterly RevPAR in Americas rose 3.4 percent, compared with a rise of 0.1 percent a year ago. The company, which has 799,923 rooms globally, said total RevPAR rose 3.7 percent in the three months to June 30, higher than the 3.5 percent growth in first quarter and 1.5 percent a year earlier. It also bumped up its dividend by 10 percent to 36.6 cents. IHG had launched a cost savings program in September to fund a series of new strategic initiatives. It said on Tuesday it was on track to deliver about $125 million in annual savings by 2020."

-3.9313496010269358," Hotelier IHG room revenue rises on strong demand in China (Reuters) - InterContinental Hotels Group Plc IHG.L on Friday posted a better-than-expected rise in first-quarter global room revenue on strong demand in China, and said it was confident in the outlook for the year ahead. Revenue per available room (RevPAR), a key industry measure, rose 3.5 percent in the three months to March 31, above Morgan Stanley’s estimate of 2.5 percent. This compares with a 2.7 percent growth reported a year earlier. Strong corporate demand and higher occupancies owing to the Chinese New Year lifted RevPAR growth in its Greater China region to 11 percent in the quarter, with 10 percent growth in mainland China. In the United States, the largest market for the company in terms of room numbers, RevPAR was up 2.2 percent, which compared with a rise of 1.9 percent a year ago. The group is expanding its luxury offering and focusing on business customers to help it weather rising competition from online rental marketplaces. IHG signed an agreement on Thursday to rebrand and operate a portfolio of 13 upmarket hotels in Britain. The hotelier, which runs over 5,000 hotels under brands such as Crowne Plaza, Holiday Inn and InterContinental, said the weakening of the U.S. dollar against many major currencies increased group RevPAR to 6.5 percent in the quarter. Continental Europe RevPAR was up 6 percent in the first quarter, helped by “continued recovery in terror impacted markets”, the company said."

-2.94720436550429," France's Fonciere des Regions enters UK market in $1.2 billion hotels takeover deal PARIS (Reuters) - French property group Fonciere des Regions FDR.PA made its first foray into the British market on Thursday, in a deal to buy 14 upmarket hotels from Starwood Capital for 858 million pounds ($1.2 billion). The transaction will also see InterContinental Hotels Group IHG.L sign long-term leases for 13 of those 14 hotels, with IHG subsequently rebranding and running those hotels, which are ranked as four-star and five-star venues. Fonciere des Regions said the takeover would allow it to diversify its portfolio of assets and get a foothold in the lucrative British market, where tourism numbers have risen thanks partly to a drop in sterling following Brexit. “This acquisition is an opportunity to duplicate the development strategy already rolled out in France, Germany and Spain, where Fonciere des Regions is the preferred partner of active operators on these markets,” said Fonciere des Regions deputy chief executive Dominique Ozanne in a statement. “This transaction will help Fonciere des Regions cement its leading position on the hotel real estate investment market in Europe,” added Ozanne. IHG added that the deal with Fonciere des Regions would also allow it to increase its presence in the upmarket part of the UK hotels sector. Fonciere des Regions added that its Fonciere des Murs FMU.PA subsidiary would launch a share capital increase worth around 300 million euros to help finance the takeover. Starwood Capital said that Eastdil Secured and UBS served as advisors on the transaction. ($1.2 billion) ($1 = 0.7350 pounds)"
