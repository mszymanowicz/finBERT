14.088820826952524," China's first ""carbon neutrality"" bonds draw tepid demand SHANGHAI, Feb 9 (Reuters) - China’s first batch of “carbon neutrality” bonds received a lukewarm welcome from investors who demand higher yields, underscoring the country’s challenge to fund President Xi Jinping’s pledge to go carbon neutral by 2060. Five Chinese power companies and one airport operator began on Sunday to raise a combined 6.4 billion yuan ($992.36 million) to finance clean energy and low-carbon projects. Four of the issuers, including China Three Gorges Corp and State Power Investment Corp extended their subscription period citing market conditions. “The issuers are not happy with the price investors are willing to offer,” said a bond investor at insurer PICC, who declined to be named. Gu Weiyong, chief investment officer at asset manager Ucom Investment Co, said investors were demanding higher yields amid signs of tighter liquidity, and the imminent week-long public holiday also contributed to weak demand. The Lunar New Year holiday starts on Thursday. In addition, he added, many green bonds in China suffer from low liquidity and are not a guarantee against defaults, making them less attractive than sovereign bonds. For example, Huaneng Power International set a coupon range of 3-4% for its three-year green bonds, compared with 2.9% for Chinese treasury bonds with the same tenor. President Xi last year called for a “green revolution”, vowing that China will reach peak carbon emissions before 2030 and achieve net zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2060. To meet the carbon neutrality pledge, China needs to mobilize its financial system to channel over 100 trillion yuan, or even several hundred trillion yuan into green investments, Chinese central bank advisor Ma Jun wrote in a January report. Currently, China’s green finance standards, and disclosure rules don’t fully match with the carbon neutrality goal, and there’s inadequate incentive to support green investing, said Ma, who is also chairman of the China Green Finance Committee. The deadline for investor subscriptions had originally been set at 5 p.m. on Monday, but State Power Investment Corp and Huaneng Power extended the subscription period for a few hours while Yalong River Hydropower Development Co and Three Gorges reset the deadline for 11 a.m. on Tuesday.

-6.545690213869085," Energy security and economic fears drive China's return to coal QINGYANG, China (Reuters) - Red coal trucks zip up and down narrow dirt tracks, churning up clouds of dust in China’s remote Gansu province. Nearby, the towering stanchions of a new railway bridge rise out of a muddy river winding through the hills. The Huaneng Group, one of five big Chinese state utilities, is building a $1.9 billion 4 gigawatt coal and power project in the northwestern region near the city of Qingyang, with the aim of delivering its electricity to the east of the country. The Zhengning Power Plant Project, which was revived in July four years after it was put on ice, encapsulates the competing pressures that lie behind China’s economic and climate policies. President Xi Jinping surprised the world last week by pledging China would aim for “carbon neutrality” by 2060, but Beijing remains worried about energy security, jobs and growth, especially as the economy recovers from the COVID-19 pandemic. In a sign of the conflicting forces at play, in the very same province of Gansu, at least three coal-fired power stations have shut since 2017, bankrupted by rising environmental costs and the widespread availability of cheaper, renewable energy. China is adding wind, solar and hydropower projects at a heady pace so the Zhengning plant itself is unlikely to threaten any of the country’s carbon targets, and coal could still decline as a proportion of the country’s energy mix. China is also decommissioning outdated coal-fired plants and replacing them with new, more efficient power stations that will burn less coal and provide crucial baseload electricity to support the country’s shift towards more renewable energy. Yet China still added 11.4 gigawatts of coal-fired capacity in the first six months of 2020, more than half the amount built worldwide during the period. A study by research group Global Energy Monitor (GEM), also showed that nearly 250 GW of coal-fired plants are under development in China - enough to power Europe’s biggest economy, Germany. “New coal plants are a way for provinces to support other industries like coal mining and heavy industry,” said Christine Shearer, coal programme director at GEM, which tracks fossil fuel infrastructure worldwide. “You have a lot of entrenched coal interests in China and the central government has not reined them in, despite Beijing’s strong support for clean energy,” she said. Neither China’s energy regulator nor the provincial government in Gansu responded to requests to comment for this story. Huaneng did not immediately respond to faxed questions. The Zhengning project was put on the backburner in 2016. Utilisation rates for coal-fired plants were plummeting and China’s appetite for fossil fuels seemed to be on the wane. But Huaneng submitted a 500-page environmental impact report in July to relaunch the project. Even though it warned it could damage farmland and water supplies, construction is due to begin this year, with the first unit set to generate power by 2023, according to state media reports. The main site is marked out with flags bearing the insignia of China Energy Construction Group, the state-owned engineering company that will build the plant. The surrounding brittle, mountainous landscape is already being transformed by new coal mines, bridges and apartment blocks for incoming workers, and some local residents used to growing fruit are packing up. “This used to be farmers’ land, mainly for planting apple trees,” said Wang Chunxiang, who owns an orchard near the construction site. “Now, the farmers have long gone.” China has vowed to end its long and problematic love affair with coal to reduce smog and slash greenhouse gas emissions. It has cut the share of coal in its total energy mix from about 70% in 2010 to 57.7% by the end of last year, and it aims to hit 53% by 2025 by aggressively promoting renewables. China had just over 1,000 GW of coal-fired power last year, but it also had 759 GW of renewable energy - almost three times more than the United States and equivalent to the United States and the European Union combined, data here from the International Renewable Energy Agency showed. Xie Zhenhua, China’s veteran climate envoy, said last week that coal demand peaked in 2013 and Beijing was preparing to adopt tough new measures in its 2021-2025 five-year plan to reduce consumption further. A study co-authored by a Chinese government-backed research institute said in January that China must end the construction of all new coal-fired power plants to meet its long-term climate goals in the most economically feasible manner. But some experts believe projects such as the Zhengning plant show coal is making a comeback. And despite Xi’s surprise announcement at the United Nations, China is not expecting its carbon dioxide emissions to peak until 2030, at the latest. An analysis here by CarbonBrief of post-COVID stimulus plans in eight provinces that produce half of China's CO2 emissions shows planned spending on fossil fuel energy projects outstrips new investment in renewable energy by three to one. Experts fear the decision by U.S. President Donald Trump to withdraw from the 2015 Paris Agreement has eased the pressure on Beijing to be more ambitious. They have also expressed concern that China’s past success in meeting its climate targets could lead to complacency among policymakers. China met its 2005-2020 carbon intensity goals three years ahead of schedule, and some government scholars believe carbon emissions could peak well before the country’s 2030 target, even without taking any additional measures. The government is trying to control the number of new coal plants and has set up a traffic light warning scheme that flashes red to regions with too much capacity and green to provinces that can go ahead with construction. In June, the state planning agency also criticised local authorities for building too many new facilities. However, observers say the economy remains the main preoccupation. “Beijing is reluctant to do anything that might slow economic growth, which is why you see the central government slapping the provinces on the wrist for all the newly permitted plants ... but not actually doing anything about them,” said Shearer at GEM. Amid growing geopolitical tensions, power projects fueled by domestic coal could also become more attractive because the government is keen to improve self-sufficiency and ease its dependence on foreign energy supplies. China has the third largest coal reserves in the world but it became a net importer of the fossil fuel in 2009 and has been the world’s biggest importer of oil in 2017. The National Energy Administration (NEA) said in June that China needed to refocus on energy security to “align with the developing environment and changing trends at home and abroad”. “The NEA has made energy security the number one priority now,” said Li Shuo, senior climate adviser with environmental group Greenpeace. “It doesn’t provide favourable conditions for a green and low-carbon transition.” China wants to ensure its recovery is not disrupted by the sort of crippling power shortages that hit the country in 2011. Some also argue China needs more coal-fired projects to provide the stable baseload required during periods of heavy demand, said an official at a leading power firm who declined to be identified as he was not authorised to speak to the media. But as workers at the Zhengning plant prepare to start construction, coal-fired power plants elsewhere in Gansu are being driven out of business. On the outskirts of the provincial capital Lanzhou, the two giant cooling towers of the Liancheng plant have stood idle since 2018. With most workers relocated, a skeleton staff guards the property, tends to a small flower garden and feeds an elderly watchdog tethered to a truck. Opposite the plant’s chain-locked gates, a row of restaurants and repair shops have also shut - collateral damage in a province-wide campaign by state-owned power firms to restructure and divest loss-making assets. The Liancheng plant - owned by Huaneng rival, the Datang Group - suffered a fatal blow in 2015 when its main customer, a smelter run by state-owned aluminium giant Chinalco, was decommissioned. Court documents say Liancheng had racked up as much as 1 billion yuan in debt when it went bankrupt last year. Residents said while the closures have had an impact on the local economy, at least the air was clean now. “The pollution used to be really heavy, especially when you add in the exhaust fumes from all the vehicles coming and going,” said Li Wanzhen, a retired local resident. ‘REALLY FILTHY’ A power plant in the town of Huating in the east of Gansu province also closed six months ago, forcing adjoining coal mines to find new markets. Nearby, bent-backed labourers black with dust unloaded coal from a truck - violating environmental rules to deliver fuel to local residences and businesses. The Gangu power plant in the south of Gansu, which is also owned by the Datang Group, declared bankruptcy in 2017. Local officials said its assets have recently been sold to a private firm but the plant was unlikely to reopen. “Before they did the environmental protection this place was really filthy, but in the last couple of years the environmental protection was really strict and we stopped seeing the smoke,” said Wu Shenbin, a worker loading chemical fertiliser onto a truck near the plant. “After that, it shut down.” Still, losses are not a major concern, because most of the builders and plant operators are state-backed firms that can write off debts, the power firm official said. But the new plants could still end up saddling China with too much surplus capacity, said He Jiankun, a government adviser and director of the Institute of Climate Change and Sustainable Development at Tsinghua University. “Strictly controlling the rebound in coal consumption is an important task facing the current economic recovery process,” he said in written remarks published on social media. Near the Zhengning site, Wang, a 53-year-old mother of four who built a lavish home with the proceeds from her family’s fruit business, is resigned to leaving once construction gets underway - and the dust and noise make conditions intolerable. “They haven’t given us any specific date when we should move ... It’s going to be a lot of trouble,” she said. “We only just built this house six years ago and it’s going to be hard to give it up.”"
-16.335735559566785," Invesco thrives in China as former executive Ross leads Trump's trade war BOSTON (Reuters) - The former investment company of U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has been flourishing in China, even as he marshals billions of dollars’ worth of punishing tariffs in America’s deepening trade war. U.S. money manager Invesco Ltd IVZ.N - for which Ross was a senior executive from 2006 until he joined Trump's cabinet in February 2017 - has become the top foreign manager of Chinese money in China over the past year through its joint venture Invesco Great Wall Management, according to research firm Z-Ben Advisors, leaping ahead of Switzerland's UBS UBS.N. It is an unlikely success story that Invesco executives say has nothing to do with government policy, but is instead rooted in the company’s decades’ worth of relationships in China. Invesco maintains managerial control of its joint venture there, despite Chinese ownership limits. Last year the joint venture secured a lucrative 2018 listing on a huge Alibaba Group Holding Ltd BABA.N money market platform, where its fund has amassed $14.1 billion in assets. But American tariffs appear to have helped at least one Invesco steel investment in China, according to interviews and company disclosures. In late 2017, Invesco, through its private equity arm WL Ross & Co, took a lead role in restructuring bankrupt regional player Chongqing Iron & Steel 601005.SS with China Baowu Steel Group, also known as Baosteel. The recapitalization of Chongqing was completed in January 2018, just months before the Trump administration imposed 25% tariffs on Chinese steel imports. Chongqing reported a 71% increase in operating profit in 2018, according to company financial reports. The company said it benefited from reduced debt, Beijing’s mandate to remove excess capacity, and rising global steel prices amid Trump’s tariffs. Invesco and WL Ross & Co sold their equity stake in Chongqing in late 2018, realizing a 1.6 times return on investment in about 12 months, Invesco said. Four Rivers Investment Management, a joint venture led by WL Ross & Co and Baowu, China’s largest steel producer by volume, took a 23.5% stake in Chongqing after the restructuring. Invesco and WL Ross & Co were listed as stakeholders in the partnership when Chongqing filed its annual report on March 29. Four Rivers has up to $12 billion set aside for similar steel deals in China, according to Morgan Stanley analyst Rachel Zhang. She pointed out that given output limits, the only way for Chinese steel makers to grow is through mergers and acquisitions. Ross founded New York-based WL Ross & Co in 2000, and it has operated as a unit of Invesco since 2006. Ross sold his Invesco shares in December 2017. He said he mistakenly thought he had sold the stock earlier, as he was required to do. “I discovered that the previously held stock had not been sold. I then promptly sold these shares,” he wrote in a disclosure with U.S. government ethics officials. When asked in June about Wilbur Ross’ role in leading the United States’ trade war with China, Invesco chief executive Martin Flanagan acknowledged he was uncomfortable talking about his former colleague. He said he had not talked to Ross or Karen Dunn Kelley, Invesco’s former fixed-income chief, who now serves as Ross’ top lieutenant at Commerce, in more than 18 months. “We have mutually agreed to not spend time with one another just because of the potential perceived issue (of conflicts of interest),” Flanagan said. “I’m very sensitive about it and they are also.” Ross was not available for comment. Operating profit from Invesco’s joint venture in China rose 29% to $19.2 million in the second quarter from the previous three months, the company said on July 25. The company said the profit margin on the joint venture was more than 50%. Invesco Great Wall also reported $35.2 billion in average assets under management at the end of June, 58% higher than nine months earlier. The company’s overall Asia assets surged 13% to $118.6 billion during the first half of the year on net deposits from clients and market gains. But Invesco’s overall operating profit, including assets outside China, dropped 91% in the second quarter after taking charges related to its May acquisition of OppenheimerFunds from MassMutual. Although Invesco’s Chinese steel bet may have gotten a lift from the Trump trade war, Invesco’s executives say its winning play book in China took decades to write. The company first invested and managed money there in the early 1990s, and has raced ahead of BlackRock Inc BLK.N, Fidelity International, JPMorgan Chase & Co Inc JPM.N and Morgan Stanley MS.N, among others. Unlike most U.S. rivals, Invesco manages the joint venture with its Chinese partner, state-owned Huaneng Power International Inc 600011.SS. Each owns a 49% stake, but Invesco has management control. “This structure enabled Invesco to operate inside a board which was evenly held by the Chinese and Invesco,” said Peter Alexander, managing director of Z-Ben Advisors. “The elevation of the CEO – appointed by Invesco – to the board tipped the scales and with it all but allowed Invesco to run the (joint venture) essentially as a subsidiary.” Larger U.S. rivals typically do not manage the joint ventures they have with top-tier Chinese financial services companies. “We didn’t want to be part of a big bank or insurance company. We did not want to be overwhelmed and we wanted to be free of any conflicts,” Andrew Lo, the head of Invesco’s business in the Asia Pacific region, told Reuters in a telephone interview in July. “We wanted a relationship that allowed us to run the company and build the company from the start,” he said. Huaneng brought deep contacts in Chinese business and political circles, while Invesco delivered money management and investment expertise, Lo said. The world’s top banks and asset managers have been in China for years, too. But their joint ventures, and limited access to the mainland’s explosive wealth management market, have been a source of frustration. China is expected to end ownership limits for foreign investors in its financial sector in 2020, a year earlier than scheduled, to show the world it will keep opening up its markets, Premier Li Keqiang said last month. In June 2018, Invesco Great Wall also scored a coup when its Jingyi money fund was selected to be on the Yu'e Bao money-market platform. Yu'e Bao is an online spare cash management platform integrated with Ant Financial's Alipay, one of China’s largest digital payment platforms. It has more than 500 million users, according to Ant Financial, a unit of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd BABA.N. Invesco CEO Flanagan declined to say how the fund was picked to be on the platform, but said it was related to the company’s presence in China. “It’s literally decades of constant engagement and then you become an overnight success,” he said.

-16.678394894844494," China state firms draw up plans to deleverage, cut debt ratios: paper SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Six of China’s biggest state-owned firms have drawn up plans to reduce debt and leverage in the coming two years, state media said on Friday, part of the country’s efforts to rejuvenate the debt-ridden sector. China began a new round of reforms in 2016 aimed at streamlining its lumbering state-owned enterprises (SOEs) by introducing private capital, curbing overcapacity, shutting down “zombie” subsidiaries and restructuring assets. It has already cut the total number of companies under central government control to 96, down from 117 in 2012. The official China Securities Journal said on Friday that the six firms - including the country's biggest refiner, the Sinopec Group 600028.SS - have already finished drawing up their debt-reduction plans and have submitted them to the regulator, the State Asset Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC). Two of China's big state power groups, Huaneng and Huadian, as well as the China Railway Construction Corporation 601186.SS, the China State Construction Engineering Corp 601668.SS and the China Merchants Group, are also among the six pilot enterprises, it said, adding that SASAC itself was also preparing to release its ""work plan"" to control debt ratios at the 96 firms now under its jurisdiction. The 96 companies are under political pressure to cut debt to asset ratios by an average of 2 percentage points by 2020. SASAC chairman Xiao Yaqing told a meeting of executives earlier this month that firms needed to adjust investment structures, slash excess capacity and improve cash flow management in order to achieve the goal. Debt to asset ratios among central government enterprises stood at an average of 66 percent by the end of June, down 0.3 percentage points since the beginning of the year, SASAC said at a Thursday briefing. The figure still amounts to about 36 trillion yuan ($5.4 trillion)."
