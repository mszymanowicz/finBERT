-3.544331016386827," Adidas plans to sell struggling Reebok brand BERLIN (Reuters) - German sportswear maker Adidas AG plans to sell or spin-off its underperforming Reebok brand, 15 years after it bought the U.S. fitness label to help compete with arch-rival Nike Inc. Adidas said on Tuesday it had decided to begin a formal process aimed at divesting Reebok as part of a five-year strategy it plans to present on March 10, when the company will also publish 2020 results. It will report Reebok as a discontinued operation from the first quarter of 2021. A banking source said the business could be worth around 1 billion euros ($1.2 billion). “Reebok and Adidas will be able to significantly better realize their growth potential independently of each other,” Chief Executive Kasper Rorsted said in a statement . The company bought Boston-based Reebok for $3.8 billion in 2006, but its sluggish performance led to repeated calls from investors to dispose of the brand. In the meantime, Adidas managed to eat into Nike’s dominance in the United States with its core brand, helped by partnership with celebrities like Kanye West, Beyonce and Pharrell Williams. After Rorsted took over as CEO in 2016, he launched a turnaround plan for Reebok, which helped it return to profitability, but its performance continued to lag that of the core Adidas brand and it was then hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. Reebok’s net sales fell 7% in the third quarter of 2020 to 403 million euros ($488 million), after falling as much as 44% the preceding quarter. In 2019, Adidas wrote down Reebok’s book value by nearly half, compared with 2018, to 842 million euros. Options for Adidas include spinning Reebok off as a stand-alone public company, or selling the brand to private equity, another major sports retailer or a multibrand player like VF Corp. Reebok’s recent collaborations with celebrities like Cardi B and a refreshed focus on women’s apparel have put the brand in a better place, analysts say. Adidas said in November it was expecting a drop in overall sales for the end of 2020 as the reimposition of lockdowns in Europe offset a return to growth in China and strong demand for running gear and products designed by Beyonce.

-3.709524758251227," Serena channels Olympic champion FloJo with single-legged catsuit MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Serena Williams debuted a striking single-legged leotard in her first match in the Australian Open on Monday, paying homage to the Olympic track champion Florence Griffith Joyner, known for her long, colourful fingernails and flamboyant outfits. After wearing the black, red and pink catsuit to dispatch Germany’s Laura Siegemund, Williams credited Nike for coming up with the idea to channel FloJo, as the athlete was popularly known, and spoke of her admiration for the late athlete. “I was inspired by FloJo, who was a wonderful track athlete, amazing athlete when I was growing up. Well, watching her fashion, just always changing, her outfits were always amazing,” Williams told a press conference. Joyner’s Olympic records for the 100 and 200 metres set in Seoul in 1988 still stand, although her early death at 39 from a seizure raised suspicions of possible steroid use that tarnished her legacy. “This year we thought of what can we do to keep elevating the Serena Williams on the court,” Williams said. The idea to tap FloJo for inspiration came from the Nike team, she told a press conference. “I was like, Oh, my God, this is so brilliant...Obviously we made some changes and tweaks to it. It became this.” Williams is not the first celebrity to pay fashion homage to Joyner. During a tribute to Black athletics stars at Halloween in 2018, singer Beyoncé wore a single-legged maroon leotard. Her husband Jay-Z wore a tracksuit and gave black power salute, in a nod to Tommie Smith and John Carlos, who made the gesture at the 1968 Mexico Olympic to protest racial injustice after finishing first and third in the 200 metres."
-8.704570893483005," Walgreens, CVS beef up protections against threat of 'bot' attacks on vaccine program NEW YORK/CHICAGO/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - U.S. retailers and pharmacies like Walgreens and CVS Health are preparing for a fresh round of “bot” attacks by scalpers hoping to snap up COVID-19 vaccine appointments as they did hoarding Sony PlayStation 5s and Nike sneakers. For over a decade, the retail industry has battled so-called “scalper bots,” programmed to cut digital lines and snap up limited-supply products within milliseconds of their release, that are resold at significant mark-ups. The coronavirus pandemic exacerbated the problem because the boom in online shopping expanded scalpers’ sights to new categories from fitness equipment to essential goods like toilet paper and detergents. In Britain, scalpers using bots have also snatched online grocery delivery slots reserved for at-risk senior citizens. The Joe Biden administration said this week that it will soon start distributing about 1 million doses per week directly to about 6,500 pharmacies in the first phase of a federal program that aims to expand access to vaccines. Security companies that track this activity now warn that U.S. retailers and pharmacies enlisted to play a big role in COVID-19 vaccine dissemination could be the next target of bot attacks as they begin distributing as early as Feb. 11. These fears stem from problems retailers have faced this past holiday shopping season, when the latest PlayStation and Microsoft Xbox consoles were nearly impossible to find because scalpers attacked major retailers. “Queue-jumpers are branching out. Their tools are now being used to target other high-demand items,” said Matt Gracey-McMinn, head of threat research at bot security firm Netacea. Walmart told Reuters in December most of the “significantly higher” traffic for the consoles came from bots, and that the company had to conduct after-sale audits, cancelling orders placed by bots and making those products available to regular consumers. Another attack like the one retailers faced over the holiday shopping season could further snarl a fragile process where just 32 million doses have been administered since federal regulators in December granted emergency approval to two vaccines, according to the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). In recent weeks, people shared on social media networks horror stories of attempting to secure vaccination appointments from government sources, with some blaming bots for site crashes and stolen slots. The private sector is girding for tech problems. “The Walgreens team is working to ensure only authorized and eligible patients will have access to schedule a vaccine appointment,” said Jim Cameli, Walgreens Boots Alliance’s Chief Information Security Officer. ”To do so, security measures such as bot detection and prevention will play key roles in delivering this critical service to patients.” CVS said its program could thwart bot attacks. “Our vaccination appointment site has a layered defense that includes capabilities to detect automated cyber attacks, such as botnets. Those capabilities, together with our application design and user input validation, enable us to validate legitimate users,” a CVS Health spokesman said. When asked if it was worried about bots attacking Covid-19 vaccine appointments, Walmart said it would “focus on security and any necessary mitigation steps that help us provide fair and equitable vaccination sign-ups.” Walmart said in a blog post on Tuesday that, starting late next week, once the retailer receives doses from the federal government at select pharmacies in 22 states, vaccine-eligible customers can use a scheduling tool to lock in appointments online “while allocation lasts.” Such websites, however, make retailers easier targets for bots than the states currently handling vaccine appointments, two cybersecurity experts said. Securing appointments by going through local governments requires a more complicated process of navigating different websites. This makes it harder for both people and bots to complete the process. The complexity of securing vaccine appointments from the government, even without explicit evidence of bots tampering the process, inspired a few programmers to create website monitoring programs like Georgia Vax, Visualping and NYC Vaccine List, which alert people to available appointments at a local level for free. The National Association of Chain Drug Stores (NACDS) said on a media call Friday the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) plans to launch “Vaccine Finder,” a tool the health organization has “developed over time” to help those eligible locate the vaccine. The CDC was not immediately available for comment. “It would be hard for anyone to really make a lot of money attacking states because every county is different,” said Ben Warlick, an Atlanta-based lawyer who has been writing appointment monitoring bots for free to help people get the vaccine. “Creating a large nationwide system would just be too difficult to set up.” But for retailers, the threat is real. “Several of our customers have come to us worried about the frightening dilemma they will ultimately face: how do we manage vaccine appointments without it being upended by automated, bot attacks?” said Edward Roberts, a specialist at security firm Imperva. He added, “The dam will explode once vaccines are available for all citizens.”"

-4.131183793333637," Nike urges court to throw out EU probe into Dutch tax deal BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. sportswear maker Nike on Monday urged Europe’s second-highest court to annul an EU investigation into its Dutch tax rulings, saying the bloc’s competition enforcers had failed to show these amounted to illegal state aid. The European Commission launched an investigation into Nike’s Dutch tax status in January 2019, part of a crackdown on multinationals’ sweetheart tax deals with EU countries giving them an unfair advantage. At issue are five tax rulings issued by Dutch authorities from 2006 to 2015, two of which are still in force, which endorsed a method to calculate royalty payments to Nike’s Dutch entities - Nike European Operations Netherlands and Converse Netherlands - for the use of intellectual property. EU enforcers said the royalty payments appeared higher than those which independent companies would have agreed between themselves, and may have unduly reduced the Dutch entities’ taxable base and given Nike a selective advantage amounting to illegal state aid. The Commission’s preliminary assessment that state aid is involved contained legal errors, Nike said in its arguments, according to a filing on the Luxembourg-based General Court’s website. EU regulators also failed to provide “sufficient reasons for finding that the contested measures fulfil all elements of state aid, especially why they should be regarded as selective”, the company said. The sportswear company also faulted the Commission for rushing to open a formal investigation “where there were no difficulties to continue the preliminary investigation.” The Commission has a mixed record in its campaign against unfair tax deals, with Apple winning its legal fight against a 13 billion euro Irish tax order and Starbucks against a 30 million euro Dutch tax order. It won the court’s backing in Fiat’s Luxembourg tax case. Judges will rule on Nike’s challenge in the coming months. The case is T-648/19 Nike European Operations Netherlands et Converse Netherlands v Commission."

-3.3585307806881697," Athletics-Coe all for innovation in shoe technology as records fall (Reuters) - World Athletics president Sebastian Coe believes steps to curb research and development of shoes would only “suffocate innovation”, as elite athletes increasingly shatter world records wearing high-tech footwear. A debate over runners’ shoes has been raging since high-tech shoes developed by Nike played a starring role in two of the biggest distance-running achievements of 2019. Ugandan Joshua Cheptegei broke the men’s 10,000m world record and Ethiopia’s Letesenbet Gidey demolished the women’s 5,000m record in Valencia in October last year, with both wearing Nike’s ZoomX Dragonfly spikes. Kenya’s Kibiwott Kandie smashed the half marathon world record by 29 seconds last month wearing an Adidas road racing shoe. “I remember a period in the mid-2000s where Adidas were the kings of the podium, particularly in distance. So these things come in cycles,” Coe was quoted as saying by the Guardian. “And there’s a built-in dynamic where shoe companies mercifully are still investing a lot of money into the research and development of shoes. I’m pleased they’re doing that. “At the moment I’m pretty calm about this. And the balance of judgment here is always ... that we shouldn’t be in the business of trying to suffocate innovation.” Coe said the sport had not reached a point where “world records are being handed out like confetti.” “If I go back to the 1930s I still marvel at Rudolf Harbig who ran 1:46 and bits for 800m on a cinder track,” he added. “And I still marvel at Peter Snell, who ran world records and some significantly sub-1:45s on grass tracks. Meanwhile Derek Clayton ran a world marathon record in shoes that you wouldn’t have gone for a stroll with in your local park.”"
4.502530684617129," Nike raises full-year sales forecast, posts surprise earnings growth (Reuters) -Nike Inc said on Friday that full-year revenue will likely be better than previously expected, after COVID-wary shoppers demanding outdoor sportswear drove its third consecutive surge in online sales. Shares in Beaverton, Oregon-based Nike were up about 5% in trading after the bell. They have gained about 37% this year. The global health crisis has pushed people to take up activities such as running or biking, giving a much needed boost to Nike and other sportswear makers after they took a hit to sales earlier in the year. Under lockdown, people have also been logging into Nike’s workout and store apps en masse, driving significantly higher online sales all year. The time Nike has invested in its e-commerce channels has paid off and given it a big competitive edge over rivals like Adidas, said Jessica Ramirez, retail analyst at Jane Hali & Associates. “Nike’s website is promptly updated and easy to browse, its app is intuitive and its focus on gathering customer data through its various services has really helped it target the right consumers at a time when people are more cautious with their spending.” The world’s biggest athletic apparel company said it expects annual revenue growth in the “low-teens,” up from its previous forecast of a high single-digit to low double-digit increase. Nike said digital sales jumped 84%, with triple-digit growth in North America - its biggest market - and strong double-digit increases in other parts of the world. Revenue rose about 9% to $11.24 billion in the second quarter ended Nov. 30, while analysts on average had expected $10.56 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The company reported a 12% increase in profit to $1.25 billion, or 78 cents per share, beating analysts’ expectations of 62 cents per share.

4.502530684617129," Analysis-Nike's free workout apps are key to its high-end pricing strategy CHICAGO (Reuters) - With consumers under lockdown logging into Nike’s workout apps and digital store, the Beaverton, Oregon-based company has been able to gather additional data on purchasing habits, personal information and exercise routines of tens of millions of people. Between January and November this year, the Nike Run Club app was downloaded 15.4 million times around the world, up 45.3% versus the same period in 2019, according to data firm Sensor Tower. The Nike SNKRS online store app was downloaded 59.5% times more than last year. Through its apps, Nike has information ranging from people’s height and weight to locations and browsing habits. Nike can tap into these details to craft ads and attract customers, three investors in Nike and several analysts said. Nike did not immediately respond to a request for comment about how it uses app data. At a Morgan Stanley conference in November, Nike Chief Financial Officer Matt Friend said the retailer added about 55 million new customers to its member database this year. The company’s practices generally seem to be in line with those of other retailers with advanced ecommerce operations, according to lawyers who advise retailers on how they can use consumer data. Nike, however, has a “significant advantage” over rivals because of its workout apps. It likely has several scientists using the data to see if shoppers will tolerate higher prices, said Mary Hildebrand, who heads law firm Lowenstein Sandler’s privacy and cybersecurity practice. The world’s biggest sportswear company has recently launched pricey sneakers like some Nike Adapt BB 2.0s that sell for $400, or low-top Dior Air Jordan 1s that cost about $2,000. Nike has also spent on technology to make products like its lightweight, roughly $220 Nike Air VaporMax 2020 Flyknits that use recycled polyester yarn. “Early in the pandemic, Nike made in-app workouts for its Nike Training Club app free. This was a masterstroke ... They know everything - exactly what you’re searching, where you live, what your credit card details are, how much you’re willing to pay,” said Michael Faherty, a portfolio manager at Nike investor Seilern Investment Management. “I absolutely think that this increased visibility gives them more pricing power,” Faherty said. Nike has also this year increased prices of older styles, like the Air Force 1 ‘07 and Air VaporMax Plus, which ran in November for $109.19 and $198.24 respectively, according to StyleSage, which scraped data from Nike’s website. On Friday, Nike is expected to report a 2.2% increase in second-quarter sales, boosted by another sharp increase in digital sales. Ramiz Chelat, a portfolio manager at Nike investor Vontobel Asset Management, said new products in Nike’s Air Zoom line, for instance, were priced at a premium – roughly $200 in some cases - that is driving gross margins. When signing up for the Nike Run Club app, iPhone users have the option to sync their account with their Apple Health app to “keep close track of all your fitness data.” Users need to provide information like gender, height and weight before the app allows them to sign up for “guided runs” or “five-minute runs.” Information like this can help gauge customer demand – for instance, knowing that more women are watching a particular workout means Nike may also know what products to place in that video. In September, a Reuters analysis of a varied basket of goods, including Nike Air Maxes, showed that the company was able to discount less this year."
4.773805513197138," Superdry names founder Dunkerton as permanent CEO (Reuters) - British fashion retailer Superdry said on Wednesday its co-founder and interim Chief Executive Officer Julian Dunkerton would take the top job on a permanent basis and appointed industry veteran Silvana Bonello as its chief operating officer. Dunkerton, Superdry’s biggest shareholder with a 20.3% stake, rejoined the company’s board in April last year after narrowly winning a shareholder vote, prompting the existing directors, including then CEO Euan Sutherland, to resign en masse. The company, known for its hoodies and jackets featuring Japanese text, is attempting a turnaround under Dunkerton who founded the firm in 2003 along with James Holder, but left in 2018 because he could not “put his name to the strategy”. Bonello, who will join the company in March, spent 18 years at Nike and was most recently the VP of operations for Vans EMEA. The company also said Chairman Peter Williams would be stepping down next year, after less than two years in the role, once a successor is appointed. His exit comes after the departure of Chief Financial Officer Nick Gresham, who stepped down in October, after only 16 months in the role. “With the search for a new CFO well advanced, the completed executive team will be in place early next year and so 2021 is an appropriate time for me to step down,” Williams said. Dunkerton’s appointment replaces his interim contract, which was due to expire in April 2021, Superdry said."
7.012901556442341," Nike hikes dividend by 12% ahead of expected sales bounce (Reuters) - Nike Inc NKE.N said on Friday it would raise its quarterly dividend by 12%, or 3 cents per share, underscoring the financial strength of the world's largest sportswear maker in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Nike in September said it expects sales in the second half of its fiscal year ending May 2021 to be “up significantly”, as it bounces back from a slump earlier this year when retailers canceled orders and lockdowns kept people away from stores in key markets. The company’s share price, up about 30% this year, has more than doubled since its March low as it slashed costs by cutting corporate jobs and targeted online investments. A cash dividend of $0.275 per share on Nike’s outstanding class A and class B stock is payable on Dec. 29. 2020 marks Nike’s 19th consecutive year of increasing dividend payouts, after raising quarterly payments by 11% in 2019, and comes as many other companies either cut or pause shareholder returns due to the virus outbreak."

11.749822154716178," Nike shares set for record high after digital sales power stellar results (Reuters) - Nike Inc’s shares were set to open at a record high on Wednesday after the world’s largest sports shoemaker posted stellar quarterly results, driven by online sales. Shares of the company were up 12.6% at $131.6 in premarket trading. The brand’s digital sales, especially in North America, helped offset fall in sales at traditional brick-and-mortar stores due to COVID-19 restrictions and social-distancing measures. At least seven brokerages raised their 12-month price targets on the stock with the biggest bump coming from Jefferies analysts, who raised their target to $117 from $95. Jefferies analyst Randal Konik said that improvement in North America is the “biggest positive surprise” from Nike’s results, and expects the Beaverton, Oregon-based company to do well in the long term, as consumers focus more on health and wellness. Nike’s results should come as a relief to investors after the company, just a quarter ago, reported a surprise loss of $790 million as retailers canceled orders and people kept away from Nike stores in key markets including North America, Europe and China. “Nike offered its clearest signal yet that a higher digital mix and improving margins within the digital segment will push consolidated margins above historical levels,” Credit Suisse analyst Michael Binetti said."

The brand’s digital sales surged 82% in the first quarter ended Aug. 31, with at least double-digit rises recorded in all regions. In the prior quarter, Nike reported a 75% increase in online sales - nearly a third of total revenue, a goal Nike had previously set for 2023. “We know that digital is the new normal. The consumer today is digitally grounded and simply will not revert back,” Nike Chief Executive John Donahoe said. Nike said it expected fiscal full-year revenue to rise between high single digits and low double digits versus last year, saying second-half sales would be “up significantly,” even though first-half growth would be flat. Analysts forecast a fiscal 2021 sales rise of 5.9%, according to Refinitiv IBES. U.S. retailers including Foot Locker Inc and Dick’s Sporting Goods Inc - which canceled shipments in the early days of the pandemic - have begun making orders for inventory in the second half of Nike’s fiscal year, analysts say. Earnings before interest and taxes rose 18% in North America, Nike’s biggest market, with footwear sales up 11% to nearly $3 billion. “Great quarter, guidance was better than expected, the stock is priced to perfection,” said Nate Fischer, chief investment strategist at Strategic Wealth Partners, which does not own Nike shares but has the stock on its watchlist. He warned, however, that the stock would be sold off if it misses any quarters coming up. Tuesday’s results are a far cry from those of just a quarter ago, when Nike reported a surprise loss of $790 million as retailers canceled orders and people kept away from Nike stores in key markets like North America, Europe and China. Shares in the Portland, Oregon-based company have risen 16% this year. Nike has gained favor among shoppers this year with investments in marketing itself as a socially conscious company, prominently supporting movements like Black Lives Matter and Time to Vote. First-quarter sales in China, where the economy opened from lockdowns much earlier than in other parts of the world, rose 6%, led by factory stores and online sales. The company’s net income rose to $1.52 billion, or 95 cents per share, from $1.37 billion, or 86 cents per share, a year earlier.

Shares in Nike were up about 1.8% in afternoon trading, ahead of the company’s earnings report after the market closes on Tuesday. With malls and department stores like J.C. Penney JCP.N shutting shops due to COVID-19 lockdowns, people turned to e-commerce, buying significantly more products directly from Nike's website. In the fiscal fourth quarter, Nike reported a 75% rise in online sales and Wall Street analysts expect this to continue - at least nine have raised their price targets on the stock in the last two weeks. In the first quarter, 12% of all footwear on Nike.com featured new types of sneakers and shoes, versus 10% in the prior quarter, according to apparel data firm StyleSage. The company sold out 17% of all footwear this year, compared with 6% in the fourth quarter, showing improvements in customer demand and investment in new items online. Online sales for Nike clothing show a similar trend. E-commerce sales are now nearly a third of Nike’s total revenue – a goal Nike had previously set for 2023. Nike’s first-quarter adjusted sales in China are also expected to have grown by more than 10% as official lockdowns there all but ended. Particularly in North America, sales in the global athletic footwear and apparel industry have picked up, and Nike will get a boost from the new back-to-school dynamic, said Wedbush analyst Christopher Svezia. Portland, Oregon-based Nike is expected to post a net profit of $729 million in the most recent quarter, versus a loss of $790 million in the fourth quarter, according to Refinitiv. To save costs and target investment online this year, the company said in July it would cut corporate jobs starting Oct. 1 and end nine major retail contracts, including deals with department store Dillard's and Amazon.com-owned AMZN.O shoe retailer Zappos. Nike in July scrapped plans to open a major shoe plant in Arizona in favor of investments elsewhere. The company has invested this year in marketing itself as a supporter of high-profile social and political movements like Black Lives Matter and Time to Vote, and launched a new maternity line and several inclusive ad campaigns."

19.968768347855686," Fans of Australian women's team find only men's away shirt is on sale (Reuters) - Australia’s women’s soccer team, the Matildas, apologised on Friday after it emerged that their replica away kit was not on sale in female sizes. The new kit, made by Nike of 100% recycled polyester from plastic bottles, was unveiled earlier alongside the men’s home and away jerseys but fans soon noted that only the women’s gold home shirt was available for purchase online. “Unfortunately, the new national team’s away kit will not be available in women’s sizes,” the Matildas, currently ranked seventh in the world, said on their official Twitter account in response to queries about the green shirt. “We apologise for any inconvenience caused and can assure supporters that this will be rectified for the next kit release due in 2022.” Australia and New Zealand are due to host the 2023 Women’s World Cup. The omission drew amazement on social media, with players also reacting. Photographs on the Football Federation Australia (FFA) website showed Ellie Carpenter, who plays as a defender for Olympique Lyonnais in France, modelling the away shirt. “Ummmmm. this is a fairly significant problem,” commented defensive midfielder Elise Kellond-Knight, who plays in the Swedish league. ABC News quoted an FFA spokesman saying the organisation would not comment further “at the moment”. Last year the Matildas brokered a landmark deal to close the pay gap between the women’s and men’s teams. Under the deal, the FFA and Professional Footballers Australia (PFA) also agreed a new three-tiered centralised contract system with the country’s top female players earning the same as the men’s team."

The planned layoffs come after the company on Thursday reported a $790 million quarterly net loss, its first in more the two years, as its wholesale business bore the brunt of footwear retailers and department stores shutting down due to the coronavirus outbreak. Shares of the Dow component were down 6% in morning trading on Friday. “We are shifting resources and creating capacity to reinvest in our highest potential areas, and we anticipate our realignment will likely result in a net loss of jobs,” Nike said in an e-mail statement. “Reductions are not being done for cost savings. Any savings will be reinvested into our priorities,” the footwear maker said. Chief Executive Officer John Donahoe told analysts on Thursday the company would now aim for digital to account for 50% of its overall business, up from the 30% recorded in the reported quarter. “Our vision is to create a clear and connected digital marketplace ... So we’re accelerating our approach,” he said. Donahoe, a former ServiceNow CEO and eBay EBAY.O executive, joined Nike earlier this year as the company was bolstering its direct-to-consumer business.

Nike slipped 3.4%, the most among the 24 of 30 blue-chip Dow Jones Industrials constituents trading before the bell, as the footwear maker posted its first loss in more than two years hurt by store closures. U.S. lenders Bank of America Corp, JPMorgan Chase & Co, Goldman Sachs fell between 1.4% and 3.2% after the Fed capped dividend payments and barred share repurchases until at least the fourth quarter following its annual stress test. In the previous session, banks stocks had powered Wall Street’s main indexes higher, helping them offset investor fears due to rising virus infections in several U.S. states. The uptick in cases has also threatened to derail a strong rally for Wall Street that brought the S&P 500 within 9% of its February all-time high on the back of record government stimulus measures. At 6:26 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 50 points, or 0.2%. S&P 500 e-minis were up 2 points, or 0.07% and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 15.25 points, or 0.15%. Facebook Inc fell 0.8% after Verizon Communications Inc joined an advertising boycott that called out the social media giant for not doing enough to stop hate speech on its platforms. The U.S. Commerce Department’s data at 8:30 a.m. ET is expected to show personal income dropped 6% in May after surging 10.5% in April. Separately, a reading of core personal consumption expenditures price index likely remained unchanged last month after easing 0.4% in April. Friday also marks the reconstitution of the FTSE Russell indexes, including large cap Russell 1000 and small cap Russell 2000, that often marks one of the biggest trading volume days of the year.

32.918971183263515," Nike posts surprise loss as COVID-19 hits wholesale business (Reuters) - Nike Inc NKE.N on Thursday reported an unexpected quarterly loss - its first in more than two years - hurt by closures of department and retail stores due to lockdowns spurred by the COVID-19 pandemic. The footwear maker’s shares fell about 4% in after-hours trading. The wholesale business, through which Nike sells merchandise to other retailers, came to a halt amid the health crisis. That led to a 50% fall in shipments, increased inventory and higher costs due to order cancellations. As a result, gross margin fell 820 basis points in the fourth quarter, when company-owned stores and other retailers were closed for nearly eight weeks. However, Nike’s investments in its digital platform over the years helped it record a 75% rise in online sales, as many consumers shopped for activewear and sneakers from the comfort of their homes. Chief Executive Officer John Donahoe told analysts the company is now accelerating focus on its online presence, and expects its overall business to reach 50% digital penetration. Online sales accounted for 30% of total revenue in the quarter. “COVID-19 has shown that our strategy is sound,” Donahoe said. In China, where the virus was first detected, all of Nike’s stores are now open. Revenue fell 3% in the Greater China region, while they plunged nearly 47% in North America. Forrester Research retail analyst Sucharita Kodali said the Nike brand is still strong and China sales number is an indicator of what to expect in western markets and the United States as things normalize. “It’s not financially distressed ... It does not have the problems of other companies in retail.” Nike’s net loss came in at 51 cents per share and revenue fell 38% to $6.31 billion. Wall Street was expecting a profit of 7 cents per share and revenue of $7.32 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv."

28.658337127496402," Nike shares rise as Wall Street lauds recovery in China sales (Reuters) - Nike Inc NKE.N shares rose 8% on Wednesday after the sportswear maker's impressive recovery in China sales offered hope that it was prepared to cope with the financial fallout of the coronavirus pandemic in other markets. At least seven brokerages took a positive view on the stock, with some raising their price targets to as high as $95, well above its current share price of about $80. Nike shares have fallen 28% since the start of the year on worries about a substantial dent to its sales due to the pandemic, which has also led to the cancellation or postponement of major sporting events to make matters worse for the company. On Tuesday, Nike settled those nerves saying it was experiencing double-digit percentage growth in its digital business in China and that operations in Greater China were normalizing. “Nike reported China revenues only down 4% in the February quarter, which is quite frankly incredible and speaks to the brand’s ability to manage through macro dislocation,” Cowen analyst John Kernan said. He raised his price target on Nike by $10 to $85, just a day after cutting it to $75. The median target on the stock is $92. Analysts also believe that evidence of Nike’s surge in China demand is a positive for the company’s U.S. and Europe businesses, which are currently facing similar disruptions that China had encountered. “(Nike’s quarterly report) will give investors more hope around potential recovery prospects in North America & EMEA, albeit lagged,” Piper Sandler analyst Erinn Murphy wrote in a note to clients. Nike also beat estimates for quarterly revenue on strong digital demand, an area of focus for the company, having invested in the SNKRS app that offers limited-edition products for members. On a post-earnings call with analysts on Tuesday, Chief Executive Officer John Donahoe said, “We’re seeing the other side of the crisis in China ... we now have a playbook that we can use elsewhere.” However, adjusting for short-term pressure to the business, at least 5 brokerages cut their price target on the stock. Still, a majority of Wall Street analysts are bullish on Nike, with 25 out of 33 brokerages rating the stock “buy” or higher. “For stock pickers, the most important learning from Nike’s earnings call last night was how different the post-coronavirus demand curve will look for the most digitally sophisticated consumer brands,” Evercore analyst Omar Saad said."
38.7109841144416," Nike revenue beats as digital growth offsets rare China sales fall on virus hit (Reuters) - Nike Inc NKE.N beat estimates for quarterly revenue on Tuesday as strong digital demand offset the first China sales drop in nearly six years from the coronavirus-fueled shutdowns, but the company held back from providing a forecast due to the outbreak. The epidemic forced Nike to temporarily shut down stores to help contain its spread in China, where it was first detected late last year. The company has now closed stores in Europe and the United States where the virus is rapidly spreading. Governments around the world have also locked down cities and imposed stringent restrictions on travel, forcing people to turn online for their shopping needs. “At a time when people were confined to their homes, we moved swiftly to leverage our digital app ecosystem and Nike Expert Trainer network,” Chief Executive Officer John Donahoe told analysts on his first earnings call since taking the helm. Digital sales climbed more than 30% in Greater China, while sales in the region, its fastest-growing segment, fell 5% due to the store closures in the reported quarter. Overall digital sales grew 36% in the third quarter ended Feb. 29. Such sales accounted for nearly a tenth of the company’s overall revenue in fiscal 2019. Nike’s shares rose about 11% in extended trading after gaining 15% in regular hours on Tuesday. The Dow component has lost nearly 30% of its value so far this year. The company’s reported numbers weren’t disappointing, Wedbush analyst Christopher Svezia said, but the question on how the company will get through the pandemic remains. “The curious question is, where do we stand now?” Nike said 80% of its stores were now open in China and expected current-quarter sales to be flat in the region. The company said it would continue to focus on new launches, a key growth driver, despite the cancellations or postponements of several sporting events, including this year’s NBA and NFL seasons and the Tokyo Olympics. Total revenue rose 5.1% to $10.10 billion in the third quarter, beating the average analyst estimate of $9.80 billion, according to Refinitiv IBES data. Net income fell to $847 million, or 53 cents per share, from $1.10 billion, or 68 cents per share, a year earlier, due to the hit from the outbreak and a non-cash charge related to a shift to distributor model in South America."

48.65558264474307," Cowen expects Nike's sales fall $3.5 billion for May quarter (Reuters) - Nike Inc's NKE.N revenue could fall by a third in the fourth quarter, Cowen estimated, as the sportswear giant reels from store closures, supply disruptions and the suspension of this year's NBA season due to the coronavirus pandemic. The brokerage expects the 34% decline in Nike’s revenue for the quarter to lead to a loss of about 4 cents per share. Analysts currently expect revenue to rise 2.4% to $10.43 billion and profit of 64 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. “Mall traffic may cease in coming weeks and fixed costs and future inventory markdowns create an almost impossible modeling exercise globally,” said John Kernan, who is a five-star rated analyst for the accuracy of his earnings estimates on Nike. Nike shares fell nearly 16% amid plunging broader markets. The stock has lost a third of its value since the start of the year. Almost 170,000 people have been infected by the virus globally and millions more have seen their lives turned upside down due to “social distancing” and clamp-downs on gatherings of large groups become the new norm. Major sporting leagues such as the NBA and the NFL have also suspended their seasons, while companies including Nike, Lululemon Athletica Inc LULU.O and Under Armour Inc UAA.N have shut stores in North America and other markets in an effort to curb the spread of the pandemic. “There are parallels between the coronavirus impact on Nike and other brands from the cancellation of major sporting events with the impact on travel companies from the U.S. travel ban,” Jonathan Treiber, a retail-industry sales expert and the CEO of marketing platform provider RevTrax. Meanwhile London-based Woozle Research estimates Nike could be robbed of more than $5.5 billion in revenue over the next three to six months. The company’s global sales is already estimated to be down 21% between mid-February and March 10, according to about 120 major wholesalers and distributors of Nike products in China, Europe and North America polled by the research firm. Nike’s revenue last fiscal year totaled about $39.12 billion. “People don’t want to spend $150 or $200 on a pair of VaporFly Nike trainers right now,” one of the respondents told George Mosley, senior equity analyst at Woozle, which is contracted by firms including hedge fund Citadel and private equity firm KKR to conduct research on companies they are invested in. Nike’s largest rival, Adidas, said last week it expected first-quarter sales to drop by up to 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) in greater China, and overall to fall more than 10%. Nike, which reports third-quarter results next week, did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It has already warned of a financial impact to its China business."
48.65558264474307," Nike, Under Armour join retailers shutting stores to limit virus spread (Reuters) - Nike Inc, Lululemon Athletica Inc and Under Armour Inc on Sunday said they would close stores in the United States and other markets, joining a growing list of major retailers moving to help limit the spread of the coronavirus. The virus, which began in China at the end of last year, has led to school closures and canceled sports events in the United States and beyond. It is widely expected to hit retail sales as shoppers stay home to avoid catching the highly contagious COVID-19 respiratory illness that the virus causes. The United States’ top infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci said conditions would likely get worse before they get better. Nike on Sunday said it will close stores in Canada, Western Europe, Australia and New Zealand from March 16 to 27. It will continue normal operations at stores in South Korea, Japan, most of China and in many other countries. “We are taking additional steps in other Nike-managed facilities, including the option to work from home,” the U.S. sportswear firm said in a statement. Under Armour said it would shutter all North America stores from Monday for about two weeks. Lululemon said it would close its stores in North America and Europe for a similar period. “We are living in uncertain times and we’re learning more about this virus every day,” Lululemon said in a statement. Nike and Lululemon operate over 650 stores combined in the United States, while Under Armour has nearly 190 stores in North America, showed the companies’ latest annual reports. Each said their online stores would continue to be open. Apparel retailer Lands End Inc and Columbia Sportswear Co also said on Sunday they would temporarily shut all of their stores in the United States and North America respectively. Gap Inc is temporarily reducing store hours for all of its locations in the United States and Canada, and closing over 100 stores, incoming Chief Executive Sonia Syngal said in a message posted on the company's website here. Apparel retailer Urban Outfitters Inc, which owns brands including Anthropologie and Free People, said on Saturday it would close its stores worldwide until at least March 28. Last week, retailers including Macy’s Inc and Saks Fifth Avenue sent notices to shoppers saying they were open for business, in a move to stem losses due to a drop in store traffic. Earlier this month, Nike temporarily closed its European headquarters in the Netherlands after an employee was infected with the coronavirus."

13.580226912862356," UPDATE 1-U.S. senator calls for action on forced labor in China's Xinjiang (Adds Nike’s statement in paragraph 10) WASHINGTON, March 10 (Reuters) - A senior U.S. senator on Tuesday accused U.S. firms of willfully ignoring “horrific” forced labor conditions in China’s Xinjiang region and called on the Commerce Department to stop American companies and consumers buying goods produced by such labor. In a letter to Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Democratic Senator Bob Menendez said recent reports indicated a wide array of U.S. companies, including Apple, Kraft Heinz , Coca-Cola, and the Gap, had sourced, or continued to source, goods from Xinjiang. “Moreover, there are consistent reports that U.S. companies fail to undertake basic labor and human rights assessments in Xinjiang, in essence willfully ignoring the horrific conditions of forced labor in Xinjiang,” Menendez, the ranking member of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, said in the letter. “In failing to uphold their responsibilities to vet their supply chains, these companies may be complicit in the mass repression of Uighurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz, and members of other Muslim minority groups,” he said. The firms Menendez mentioned did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The United Nations estimates more than a million Muslim Uighurs have been detained in camps in Xinjiang in recent years. China denies it violates Uighur rights and says the camps are designed to stamp out terrorism and provide vocational skills. Menendez, who has called for sanctions on China over the issue, also requested information about U.S. government contractors who source cotton from China, which produces 84% of its cotton in Xinjiang. “The use of materials that are manufactured using forced labor is unacceptable for products in U.S. markets,” he said in the letter. An Australian think tank said in a report earlier this month that tens of thousands of ethnic Uighurs have been transferred to work in factories across China supplying 83 global brands in conditions “that strongly suggest forced labor.” Nike Inc, which was included in that report, said in a statement on its website that while the company “does not directly source products from the Xinjiang Uighur Autonomous Region”, it had been conducting due diligence with its suppliers in China to identify and assess potential risks related to employment of people from the region. On Monday, the Washington-based Fair Labor Association, which conducts due diligence for major multinational firms, said it was “deeply troubled by credible reports of forced labor and other violations of fundamental rights in Xinjiang.” “We have directed our affiliates to review their direct and indirect sourcing relationships, identify alternative sourcing opportunities, and develop timebound plans to ensure that their sourcing is in line with the FLA’s principles,” it said.

-10.694182425837797," Nike launches new, legal Alphafly shoe to outrun 'tech doping' furore LONDON (Reuters) - Nike has launched a new running shoe that complies with limits set by World Athletics after the governing body imposed a landmark ban on a version of the sportswear giant’s Vaporfly shoes that was used to run the first sub-two hour marathon. The first-ever shoe ban by World Athletics (WA) last week addressed concerns that technology advances are giving athletes an unfair and unnatural advantage, described by some critics as “technological doping”. New rules state road shoes must have soles no thicker than 40mm and not contain more than one rigid, embedded carbon fibre plate, and limit the use of some track spikes on the Vaporfly models, but permit the continued use of most of the range. Nike has now duly launched the latest incarnation of the shoe - the Air Zoom Alphafly Next% - with one carbon plate and a sole thickness of 39.5mm, as well as newly added air pockets. “We are pleased the Nike Zoom Vaporfly series and Nike Zoom Alphafly NEXT% remain legal,” said the U.S company. “We will continue our dialogue with World Athletics and the industry on new standards.” The Vaporfly controversy has ignited a wider sporting debate: where should the line be drawn between advances in sports technology and equipment giving competitors an unfair advantage, be it running shoes, soccer boots or tennis rackets? Nike has always said it operates within the rules, while exploring the possibilities provided by new technology. Its Vaporfly shoes have led to a slew of world records since their introduction in 2016 but WA ruled last week that most of the versions used for those records, and by thousands of amateur runners, would remain legal. Kenyan runner Eliud Kipchoge used a version of the Vaporfly now deemed illegal for his unofficial sub-two hour marathon in October, a model reportedly with extra-thick soles and three carbon plates. He is expected to use the Alphafly in his London marathon showdown with Ethiopian rival Kenenisa Bekele in April’s London Marathon. After launching the new shoe on Wednesday, Nike CEO John Donahoe said it did not give athletes a “mechanical advantage”. “It’s simply using the same materials that go into a shoe and putting them together in an innovative way that allows the athlete to do their very best in a safe way,” Donahoe said in an interview with CNBC. A Wall Street Journal report said limited numbers of the new Alphafly shoes will be made available to the public online this month, thereby meeting one of WA’s eligibility requirements for the shoe to be used at this year’s Tokyo Olympics."
-10.694182425837797," Athletics: Kipchoge's sub-two shoe would be legal under new rules, says Nike LONDON (Reuters) - Nike said the Alphafly shoe worn by Eliud Kipchoge to break the two-hour marathon barrier would be legal under World Athletics’ new rules and that widespread reports of its shoes containing triple carbon plates are false. On Wednesday Nike Inc launched a new version of the shoe that complies with rules introduced by the governing body last week to limit carbon plate usage and sole thickness for elite races following concerns that technological developments were giving runners an unnatural advantage. The latest incarnation of the shoe is the Air Zoom Alphafly Next%, with one curved, carbon plate, an insole thickness of 39.5mm, as well added air pockets. The new rules - the WA’s first governing running shoe specifications - state road shoes must have insoles no thicker than 40mm and not contain more than one rigid, embedded carbon fiber plate. “We are pleased the Nike Zoom Vaporfly series and Nike Zoom Alphafly NEXT% remain legal,” said the U.S company. “We will continue our dialogue with World Athletics and the industry on new standards.” Nike followed that on Thursday by saying the shoes used by Kipchoge for his unofficial sub-two hour marathon in Vienna last October would still be legal even under the new rules. “We don’t make running shoes with three plates,” a Nike spokesperson told Reuters, adding that the midsole thickness was also within the new parameters. Industry speculation that Kipchoge’s shoes were triple-plated was based on Nike’s 2018 patent for a shoe containing triple plates. WA President Sebastian Coe, who was a Nike ambassador for 38 years until stepping down in 2015, said last week after most of Nike’s Vaporflys were deemed legal that WA “don’t believe we can rule out shoes that have been generally available for a considerable period of time”. Another change introduced last week by WA states that, from April 30, any future version, of any shoe, must have been available to the general public for four months before being allowed in elite competition. Limited numbers of the new Alphafly shoes will be made available from this month, thereby ensuring they will be legal for use at this year’s Tokyo Olympics. In the unofficial Vienna marathon, Kipchoge wore a prototype which would seemingly have been at odds with the prevailing rule for World Athletics-sanctioned races that said any shoe should be “reasonably available”, though that rule was never applied by the governing body through the various prototype versions of the shoe, which was launched as the Vaporfly in 2016. The shoe has since contributed to a host of major records and big-race wins and has become hugely popular with recreational runners suddenly slicing minutes off their best times. WA ruled last week that most of the models in the range would remain legal, much to the frustration of many observers who consider the shoes to be “mechanical doping”. Former elite British marathon runner Tam Yamauchi said WA had “given the green light to performance-enhancing shoes”, with others predicting they will produce a legal sub-two record, possibly as early as this year’s London Marathon in April when Kipchoge, the current holder, goes head to head with Kenenisa Bekele. After launching the new Alphafly version on Wednesday, Nike Chief Executive John Donahoe denied that the technology gives athletes a mechanical advantage. “It’s simply using the same materials that go into a shoe and putting them together in an innovative way that allows the athlete to do their very best in a safe way,” Donahoe said in an interview with CNBC."

-9.219237564221157," Nike prototype Vaporfly shoe banned but current version going to Olympics LONDON (Reuters) - Nike Vaporfly shoes used to run the world’s first sub-two hour marathon will be banned from professional sport under a landmark decision on Friday that also allows currently sold versions of the high-tech shoes to be used in the Olympics. The first-ever shoe ban by World Athletics (WA), the sport’s governing body, addresses concerns that technology advances are giving athletes an unfair and unnatural advantage. It limits future use of carbon fibre plates and some track spikes but stopped short of outlawing the Vaporfly models that have helped re-write the record books for elites and amateurs alike. Prototype variants of the Vaporfly used by Eliud Kipchoge to run the first sub-two hour marathon and by fellow Kenyan Brigid Kosgei to smash the women’s marathon world record were both reported to contain triple carbon plates inside thick, ultra-compressed foam, said by Nike to help improve running economy by up to four percent. Those have been banned and from April 30 any future version, of any shoe, must have been available to the general public for four months before being allowed in elite competition. That will put paid to the use by Nike and others of prototypes by their athletes in major races. Nike Inc NKE.N unleashed the Vaporfly in 2016 and various versions have quickly come to dominate the elite and ""serious recreational"" side of road running. The distinctive pink and green footwear, which cost around $250 and have a lifespan of only around 200 miles, is now widespread throughout the fields of every major race. Kipchoge and other leading athletes have welcomed the shoes as a natural technological advance, but others say they have gone too far, with Yannis Pitsiladis, a professor of sport and exercise science at Britain’s Brighton University, calling them “technological doping”. “It is not our job to regulate the entire sports shoe market but it is our duty to preserve the integrity of elite competition by ensuring that the shoes worn by elite athletes in competition do not offer any unfair assistance or advantage,” WA President Sebastian Coe said in a statement on Friday. World Athletics said any records set under the previous rules will stand. “We can draw a line by prohibiting the use of shoes that go further than what is currently on the market,” Coe said. “I believe these new rules strike the right balance by offering certainty to athletes and manufacturers as they prepare for Tokyo 2020, while addressing the concerns that have been raised about shoe technology.” The new rules state that road shoes must have soles no thicker than 40mm and not contain more than one rigid, embedded plate. The controversy could provide a boost for athletic equipment maker Nike, burnishing the Vaporfly’s reputation among amateurs not affected by the ruling. “If anything this probably brings more excitement around the product,” Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said. “Over two-thirds of footwear that is bought, is bought for fashion purposes.” WA will establish an expert working group to guide future research into shoe technology and to assess new shoes that emerge on the market. Nike did not immediately respond to Reuters’ request for comment on the decision. ‘SECRET WEAPON’ Marathon superstar Kipchoge has been the Vaporfly’s flagbearer, wearing them to set a world record, win the 2016 Olympic title and then, in an advanced version not available to the public, go under two hours in an unofficial marathon. Kosgei ran 2:14.04 in last year’s Chicago Marathon, taking 81 seconds off Briton Paula Radcliffe’s 16-year-old women’s marathon world record and making her almost three minutes faster than any other woman in history. Vaporflys have featured in several other records in the last three years and athletes wearing them took 31 of the 36 top-three finishes in the Marathon Majors series last year. Nike says the shoes have “a built-in secret weapon that provides a propulsive sensation”. Other manufacturers have also released, or are developing, their own carbon-insoled shoes, but WA’s ruling would now appear to have put the brakes on. WA’s action echoes that of swimming’ s governing body, which a decade ago banned Speedo’s record-smashing LZR speed suit. Kosgei, however, was unmoved when asked by Reuters about the ban. “The shoes did not have legs to run, it is the power and energy of an athlete,” she said. “Not every athlete who wore the shoes ran a world record.”"

The sport’s governing body said that with immediate effect, road shoes must have soles no thicker than 40mm and not contain more than one rigid, embedded plate. The Vaporfly shoes used by Eliud Kipchoge to run the first sub-2 hour marathon and by fellow Kenyan Brigid Kosgei to smash the women’s marathon world record both contained triple carbon plates.

-10.596607739707014," Focus on Avenatti, U.S. judge says, as Trump critic's Nike extortion trial begins NEW YORK (Reuters) - The judge overseeing Michael Avenatti’s extortion trial said the case should not focus on Nike Inc’s alleged corruption or devolve into celebrity name-dropping, as jury selection began for the case against the lawyer and critic of U.S. President Donald Trump. Prosecutors accused Avenatti, 48, of trying to shake down Nike for up to $25 million by threatening to publicize accusations it illegally paid families of college basketball recruits, unless it hired him and another celebrity lawyer, Mark Geragos, to conduct an internal probe. Avenatti countered that he was simply doing his job representing a whistleblowing coach in negotiations with Nike. Prosecutors said he also defrauded the coach by concealing a settlement offer made by Nike, because Avenatti was heavily in debt and wanted millions of dollars for himself. Avenatti has pleaded not guilty. Nike has denied wrongdoing. Outside the presence of prospective jurors, the trial judge, U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe in Manhattan, made clear that the trial should be about Avenatti and not whether Nike undertook a “large-scale effort to corrupt college basketball.” Gardephe also said Avenatti’s lawyers cannot mention by name Colin Kaepernick, who Geragos had represented in separate negotiations with Nike, calling the football quarterback a “divisive figure.” The judge also said Avenatti’s lawyers cannot mention several other well-known people at trial, agreeing with prosecutors that jurors might be confused. “We’re not going to get into R. Kelly, we’re not going to get into Jeffrey Epstein, we’re not going to get into Rudy Giuliani,” Gardephe said, referring respectively to the singer, late registered sex offender, and lawyer for Trump. Geragos is not expected to testify. Avenatti has been jailed since Jan. 17 in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan for a suspected bail violation in a separate case. He was stone-faced and kept his hands behind his back as roughly 120 prospective jurors entered a courtroom to fill out questionnaires for the trial, which they were told should last 2-1/2 weeks. Gardephe told jurors that nothing ever written or said about Avenatti “matters at all” at the trial. “In our country, we don’t try people in the press,” he said. Jury selection continues on Tuesday. Avenatti became famous representing adult film actress Stormy Daniels in lawsuits against Trump. He faces separate criminal trials in April for allegedly defrauding Daniels out of nearly $300,000 from a book contract, and in May for defrauding other clients and lying to the Internal Revenue Service and a bankruptcy court."
-10.596607739707014," Explainer: What to expect at Michael Avenatti's Nike extortion trial in New York NEW YORK (Reuters) - Michael Avenatti, the celebrity lawyer and self-described high-profile nemesis of U.S. President Donald Trump, faces a trial on charges he tried to extort Nike Inc and defrauded a youth basketball coach he represented. Avenatti has pleaded not guilty to three criminal counts. Jury selection is scheduled to begin on Monday in Manhattan federal court. The trial could last three weeks. Prosecutors said Avenatti threatened to hold a press conference, based on information from his client Gary Franklin, accusing Nike officials of making and trying to conceal illegal payments to families of top college basketball recruits. Franklin’s team, California Supreme, had been in the Nike Elite Youth Basketball League. Avenatti allegedly agreed not to hold the press conference if Nike agreed to pay Franklin $1.5 million, and also pay Avenatti $15 million to $25 million to conduct an internal probe, along with another lawyer. Evidence includes secret recordings of Avenatti allegedly making threats, which prosecutors said were made after Nike brought his activity to their attention. Nike has denied wrongdoing. The defendant faces two extortion-related counts. He is also charged with honest services wire fraud for allegedly concealing from Franklin a settlement offer made by Nike, and using the coach’s accusations to extract riches for himself. Avenatti faces more than 40 years in prison if convicted, but would likely get less. Avenatti has said it violates the constitutional right to free speech under the First Amendment for a civil lawyer to be prosecuted for threatening to truthfully expose misconduct by Nike that directly related to his client’s claims. He has also said the honest services fraud charge should have been dismissed because there were no bribes or kickbacks. In addition, Avenatti has said that prosecutors rushed to indict him as payback for his role as a “high-profile political antagonist” of Trump, after he began representing adult film actress Stormy Daniels in lawsuits against the president. Prosecutors in Manhattan have separately charged Avenatti with stealing about $300,000 from Daniels after helping her secure a book contract. Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford and who Avenatti no longer represents, had accused Trump of having an affair with her in 2006, a claim the president has denied. The most serious criminal case Avenatti faces is in southern California. Prosecutors there accused him of stealing millions of dollars from clients, lying to the Internal Revenue Service and a bankruptcy court, and defrauding a bank. Avenatti faces up to 335 years in prison if convicted, but would likely get less. Avenatti has pleaded not guilty in the Daniels and California cases."
-13.14791609976052," 'They're fast, but are they fair?' Amateur runners face Nike dilemma LONDON (Reuters) - British amateur runner and triathlete Holly Grundon was delighted to smash a long-held personal speed target - to finish a half marathon in less than 1 hour and 30 minutes. But the 36-year-old’s decision to switch to Nike’s Vaporfly trainers before securing her new personal best (PB) time has her wondering whether she cheated herself, or dirtied a sport she’s always loved for its purity. “When you’re running you just want to run for yourself,” Grundon told Reuters during a lunchtime run at her local park. “It’s just you against the road and the time that you have in mind to beat. “So, investing in a pair of trainers that are meant to make you automatically faster - well, there were ethical considerations, and whether it could be cheating, I suppose.” Scientific studies as well as anecdotal evidence suggest that Nike’s Vaporfly running shoes, equipped with super-springy foam soles encasing a carbon-fiber plate, can increase running efficiency by between 4% and 6%. That has persuaded millions of amateur athletes to ditch their old favorites and give them a go. The shoe has also raised question at World Athletics, the sport’s governing body, which looks set to review its rules for elite racing in light of technological advances while allowing recreational runners to wear what they want. Nike’s chief financial officer Andrew Campion told analysts in December the company’s market share in running had reached a record high in the second quarter of 2019, led by the success of the VaporFly 4% and Next% models. And the company’s chief executive Mark Parker joked: “The time it takes me to walk across the Nike campus here at headquarters has dropped by at least 4%. So I’m feeling good about it.” Grundon’s race distance was a little more ambitious. She described how she’d been chasing the 1:30 half marathon time for a few years, and “inching closer and closer to it”. When she entered the Madrid half marathon she decided it was going to be her last shot at a PB for a while before taking a training break. She opted to buy Nike’s Vaporfly shoes after seeing other fast runners wearing them and reading reviews. “They feel very strange to walk in, but as soon as you’re racing and you’re running, they really do feel fast,” she told Reuters. “I smashed my target actually quite considerably. “But even after the event, that made me wonder whether I should have worn them - because I think I probably could have beaten my target just in my ordinary trainer.” (This story corrects attribution of quote in paragraph 9) (Additional reporting by Stuart McDill and Nivedita Balu; Editing by Mike Collet-White)"

But the 36-year-old’s decision to switch to Nike’s Vaporfly trainers before securing her new personal best (PB) time has her wondering whether she cheated herself, or dirtied a sport she’s always loved for its purity. “When you’re running you just want to run for yourself,” Grundon told Reuters during a lunchtime run at her local park. “It’s just you against the road and the time that you have in mind to beat. “So, investing in a pair of trainers that are meant to make you automatically faster - well, there were ethical considerations, and whether it could be cheating, I suppose.” Scientific studies as well as anecdotal evidence suggest that Nike’s Vaporfly running shoes, equipped with super-springy foam soles encasing a carbon-fibre plate, can increase running efficiency by between 4% and 6%. That has persuaded millions of amateur athletes to ditch their old favourites and give them a go. The shoe has also raised question at World Athletics, the sport’s governing body, which looks set to review its rules for elite racing in light of technological advances while allowing recreational runners to wear what they want. Nike’s chief financial officer Andrew Campion told analysts in December the company’s market share in running had reached a record high in the second quarter of 2019, led by the success of the VaporFly 4% and Next% models. And the company’s chief executive Mark Parker joked: “The time it takes me to walk across the Nike campus here at headquarters has dropped by at least 4%. So I’m feeling good about it.” Grundon’s race distance was a little more ambitious. She described how she’d been chasing the 1:30 half marathon time for a few years, and “inching closer and closer to it”. When she entered the Madrid half marathon she decided it was going to be her last shot at a PB for a while before taking a training break. She opted to buy Nike’s Vaporfly shoes after seeing other fast runners wearing them and reading reviews. “They feel very strange to walk in, but as soon as you’re racing and you’re running, they really do feel fast,” she told Reuters. “I smashed my target actually quite considerably. “But even after the event, that made me wonder whether I should have worn them - because I think I probably could have beaten my target just in my ordinary trainer.” (Additional reporting by Stuart McDill and Nivedita Balu; Editing by Mike Collet-White)"
-16.281860744213958," Why a ban on Vaporfly shoe could boost Nike's bottom line (Reuters) - A controversy over Nike’s hyper-advanced Vaporfly shoes that some say give runners an unfair advantage could boost sales, especially among amateurs hoping for more spring in their step who would not be affected by any ban. “Controversy is good for sales,” said Matt Powell, senior sports industry adviser at NPD Group. “Nike has not made a lot of pairs here, so (there is) no real financial impact. Amateur runners can still run in these shoes.” The running world is waiting for word from governing body World Athletics, which for months has been examining what to do about the high-tech footwear, used by Kenyan runners Eliud Kipchoge and Brigid Kosgei in stunning performances last year. Among the options facing the organization are to impose a wholesale ban on the shoes or take more limited measures to deal with their carbon plate and foam sole technology. Debate has raged among athletes and commentators about whether the shoes should be allowed and if a ban could be implemented effectively beyond heavily monitored elite racing. Kipchoge, who wore Vaporflys when he ran the first sub-two-hour marathon in Vienna last October, told the Telegraph on Wednesday that wearing the shoes was “fair” and that the sport should embrace such technological advances. Nike, the world’s largest athletic apparel company, says on its website that the shoe, which retails at around $250, has “a built-in secret weapon”. It did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday. Independent studies have concluded that the shoes, which have a curved, carbon-fiber plate embedded in a layer of lightweight foam, improve metabolic efficiency by 4%, though that does not necessarily mean a runner will be 4% faster. “On the surface, banning a shoe for providing exceptional performance wouldn’t mar Nike’s reputation,” said Carol Spieckerman of consultancy Spieckerman Retail. “The controversy could easily increase general sales for the Vaporfly.” Shares in the Oregon-based firm were up 0.5%, while rival Under Armour rose 0.6 percent and Skechers USA gained about 1.6%. Japan’s Asics Corp earlier closed up 2.5%. Nike, which aims to sell $50 billion worth of sportswear this year, capitalized in the 1980s on the controversy around Michael Jordan wearing red and black sneakers that violated the NBA’s “predominantly white” rules. Nike put black censor bars over the sneakers in TV ads and later re-launched its Air Jordan 1 shoes in a “banned” edition. The brand went on to become a billion dollar business."

-16.281860744213958," Trump antagonist Avenatti's bail is revoked; unhappy NY judge delays Nike extortion trial NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Wednesday revoked Michael Avenatti’s bail after the celebrity lawyer and critic of U.S. President Donald Trump was accused of hiding money from creditors, triggering a delay in a separate trial where Avenatti is charged with trying to extort Nike Inc. U.S. District Judge James Selna remanded Avenatti to federal custody at a hearing in Santa Ana, California, where prosecutors had charged him last March with stealing millions of dollars from clients, defrauding a bank and lying to the Internal Revenue Service and a bankruptcy court. Prosecutors said Avenatti concealed $1 million he received last April, in a client settlement, from his second ex-wife and other creditors to whom he owed more than $11 million, spending some on a Mercedes-Benz. Avenatti is awaiting trial on three federal indictments, and has pleaded not guilty on all charges. In the Nike case, Avenatti was charged in Manhattan with threatening to publicly accuse the sportswear company of improperly paying families of college basketball recruits unless it paid him up to $25 million to conduct a probe plus $1.5 million to his client, a youth basketball coach. U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe, who oversees the Nike case, said Avenatti’s arrest caused an “enormous disruption” requiring an adjournment of the Jan. 21 trial, which Avenatti will be allowed to attend. Gardephe said he would be “very reluctant” to delay it past Jan. 27. Jose Quinon, a lawyer for Avenatti, sought a longer delay, saying that because the new accusations involved money his client controlled, they undermined Avenatti’s ability even to pay for witnesses. “The rug has been pulled from under us because this was absolutely, totally unexpected,” Quinon said. “It’s like going to war without weapons.” Gardephe urged both sides to work out their differences. “I’m asking that people be practical here, given the hand we have been dealt, which is a bad one,” he said. Avenatti became famous as a self-described Trump nemesis and for representing porn actress Stormy Daniels, who received hush money before the 2016 election not to reveal an alleged sexual encounter with Trump, which the president denies. Earlier Wednesday, Gardephe refused to dismiss the Nike prosecution, which Avenatti called “vindictive” and payback for his animosity toward Trump. The judge found no evidence of malice, and noted that it was Nike that alerted prosecutors to the alleged extortion. “Avenatti is being prosecuted for activities wholly unrelated to the political arena,” Gardephe wrote. Before his Tuesday arrest, Avenatti faced a possible 335 years in prison in the California case. He was also charged in Manhattan with stealing nearly $300,000 of Daniels’ proceeds from her book contract."
-17.03868191854783," U.S. judge rejects Michael Avenatti request to delay Nike extortion trial NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Tuesday rejected Michael Avenatti’s requestto delay a scheduled Jan. 21 criminal trial accusing thecelebrity lawyer of trying to extort Nike Inc. U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe in Manhattan decidedduring a telephone conference with federal prosecutors andAvenatti’s lawyers not to disturb the trial schedule, saying he did not believe the prosecutors had violated rules by turning over some evidence late. The judge denied a motion by Avenatti to bar the prosecutors from using any evidence that they turned over since Jan. 3. Avenatti is also seeking to bar prosecutors from introducing evidence about his finances. Gardephe has not yet ruled on that issue. Lawyers for Avenatti had complained on Monday that prosecutors recently and unfairly overwhelmed them with large amounts of new materials in a “document dump,” making it difficult to prepare for a trial next week. Prosecutors countered that the materials were not delivered late, and accused Avenatti of hoping to use them as part of an improper effort to make Nike the villain and distract jurors from his own guilt. Avenatti became famous over the last two years from representing porn star Stormy Daniels and criticizing U.S. President Donald Trump. The criminal case stemmed from Avenatti’s representation of youth basketball coach Gary Franklin, and allegations that Nike made improper payments to college basketball recruits. Prosecutors charged Avenatti last March with threatening to reveal the alleged payments at a news conference unless the athletic wear company paid him up to $25 million to conduct an internal probe, and Franklin up to $1.5 million. Nike has denied wrongdoing. Avenatti has pleaded not guilty. The case is U.S. v. Avenatti, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 19-cr-00373."

In a filing late Sunday night in Manhattan federal court, Avenatti’s lawyers had said prosecutors’ recent “document dump,” including more than 13,800 pages of documents and an iPhone from Avenatti’s former office manager, had “severely prejudiced” their client’s ability to prepare for trial. In response, Assistant U.S. Attorney Matthew Podolsky said there was no delay in delivering the documents, even “to gain some kind of advantage.” He also accused Avenatti of seeking to use the documents as part of “an improper effort to blame the victim,” Nike, and “distract the jury from the only question before it: the defendant’s guilt.” U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe oversees Avenatti’s case and will decide what should be done. Avenatti became known for representing porn star Stormy Daniels and criticizing U.S. President Donald Trump. He was charged with threatening to hold a news conference discussing Nike’s alleged improper payments to college basketball recruits unless the athletic wear company paid his client, youth basketball coach Gary Franklin, $1.5 million and paid Avenatti up to $25 million to conduct an internal probe. Prosecutors also charged Avenatti with failing to tell Franklin that Nike offered to settle the coach’s claims without paying Avenatti, costing the lawyer money. Avenatti has pleaded not guilty. Nike has denied wrongdoing. In his filing, Avenatti also said evidence to support prosecutors’ claim he was at least $15 million in debt when he dealt with Nike, giving him a possible motive to extort, could “overwhelm the trial” and should be excluded. He cited, among other things, prosecutors’ plan to call a former divorce lawyer for his estranged wife as a witness. Prosecutors countered that Avenatti made his own finances an issue, in part by offering his biography as part of his defense. “It is apparent that the defendant fully intends at trial to suggest-if not outright argue-that he was a successful lawyer who had no reason to commit a financially-motivated offense,” Podolsky wrote. “That suggestion would be false.” Avenatti has denied owing millions in debt. The case is U.S. v. Avenatti, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 19-cr-00373."

-14.238470699552982," U.S. judge orders Michael Avenatti to face fraud charge as Nike trial looms NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Thursday rejected celebrity lawyer Michael Avenatti’s bid to dismiss a criminal charge that he defrauded a client who he said knew about improper payments that Nike allegedly made to families of college basketball recruits. U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe in Manhattan ruled three days after refusing to dismiss two extortion charges accusing Avenatti of threatening a news conference about the payments unless Nike paid him up to $25 million. Nike has denied wrongdoing. “When the actual evidence is heard at trial rather than the baseless allegations in the indictment, I will be fully cleared because I did nothing wrong,” Avenatti, 48, said in a text message. “I am innocent.” A spokesman for U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman in Manhattan declined to comment. Known for representing porn star Stormy Daniels and criticizing U.S. President Donald Trump, Avenatti faces a Jan. 21 trial over his dealings with Nike, and two criminal trials this spring on unrelated charges. He has pleaded not guilty to all charges. Prosecutors accused Avenatti of telling Nike last March he would not publicize his client Gary Franklin’s claims about the payments if the sportswear company would pay Franklin $1.5 million, and him up to $25 million to conduct an internal probe. They said Avenatti also failed to tell Franklin, who coached a youth basketball team in a Nike-sponsored league, that Nike offered to settle the coach’s claims without paying Avenatti, and instead used those claims to secure riches for himself. Prosecutors said this fraudulently deprived Franklin of Avenatti’s “honest services.” Avenatti said the charge should have been thrown out because it did not mention a “bribe” or “kickback,” which he said was necessary under a 2010 Supreme Court case involving former Enron Corp Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling. Gardephe, however, said the absence of those words had no “talismanic significance,” and it was enough for the government to accuse Avenatti of violating a “known legal duty” to Franklin even if Nike never paid Avenatti a cent. “The indictment pleads facts sufficient to demonstrate that Avenatti violated the legally cognizable duties a lawyer owes to his client,” Gardephe wrote. The fraud count and one extortion count carry maximum 20-year prison terms. Avenatti also faces an April 21 trial in Manhattan for allegedly cheating Daniels out of proceeds from a book contract, and a May 19 trial in Santa Ana, California for allegedly defrauding clients out of millions of dollars and lying to the Internal Revenue Service. The case is U.S. v. Avenatti, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 19-cr-00373."

Liverpool were taken to court by New Balance last year after it was alleged the club was looking to switch to Nike once their existing contract ended in May 2020. Boston-based New Balance, Liverpool’s official kit supplier since the 2015-16 campaign, said they should have been allowed to match Nike’s offer. However, the club successfully argued that New Balance could not match Nike’s offer with respect to marketing and distribution, with the judge ruling New Balance’s offer “less favourable to Liverpool” compared to Nike’s offer. ""We welcome Nike into the LFC family as our new official kit supplier and expect them to be an incredible partner for the club, both at home and globally as we continue to expand our fanbase,"" the club's managing director and chief commercial officer Billy Hogan said in a statement here. “As a brand, Nike reflects our ambitions for growth, and we look forward to working with them to bring fans new and exciting products. “We’d like to thank New Balance for their support over the last few years and wish them well for the future,” Hogan added. Nike will be the club’s official kit supplier for the men’s, women’s and academy teams from June 1, it said."
-16.660328424207094," Michael Avenatti fails to narrow Nike indictment; U.S. judge cites Cosby case NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Monday rejected Michael Avenatti’s bid to dismiss two of the three counts in an indictment accusing the celebrity lawyer of trying to extort Nike Inc by threatening to reveal its alleged improper payments to college basketball recruits. Citing an alleged extortion of comedian Bill Cosby in the late 1990s, U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe in Manhattan said prosecutors could try to prove that Avenatti engaged in wrongful conduct by threatening Nike with economic and reputational harm unless it paid him millions of dollars. Gardephe also called it premature to dismiss as vague the two counts, alleging extortion and transmitting interstate communications with intent to extort. Avenatti is also charged with honest services wire fraud against his client, youth basketball coach Gary Franklin, by concealing how Nike had offered to settle so long as it did not have to hire and pay Avenatti to probe the alleged payments. Lawyers for Avenatti did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokesman for U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman in Manhattan declined to comment. Avenatti, 48, became famous representing porn star Stormy Daniels and becoming an antagonist of U.S. President Donald Trump. He faces a scheduled Jan. 21 trial after pleading not guilty to illegally demanding up to $25 million from Nike last March in exchange for not publicizing the basketball payments, and being hired for the internal probe. Nike has denied wrongdoing. In letting the case proceed, Gardephe cited the 1997 conviction of Autumn Jackson for trying to extort $40 million from Cosby in exchange for not revealing she was his illegitimate child. Cosby disputed that claim, but admitted to having an affair with Jackson’s mother, and had quietly made payments to help her and put Jackson through college. Jackson was sentenced to 26 months in prison. Cosby is serving a three- to 10-year prison sentence following his 2018 sexual assault conviction. Gardephe said conduct becomes wrongful when people to threaten economic loss or reputational harm to obtain property to which they are not entitled. Prosecutors alleged that money Avenatti sought for himself was separate from the $1.5 million he sought for Franklin. “While Avenatti’s client may have been in a position to make demands to Nike, Avenatti had no right - independent of his client - to demand millions of dollars from Nike based on confidential information supplied by his client; without his client’s knowledge; and to his client’s detriment,” Gardephe said. Avenatti has also pleaded not guilty to criminal charges in Manhattan that he cheated Daniels out of proceeds from a book contract, and in California that he defrauded clients out of millions of dollars. The case is U.S. v. Avenatti, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 19-cr-00373."

In a filing on Friday, lawyers for Avenatti said it would be “so prejudicial to Mr. Avenatti as to deprive him of a fair trial” for prosecutors to suggest he was more than $15 million in debt, a claim Avenatti “vehemently disputes,” when he allegedly tried to extort up to $25 million from Nike. Avenatti became famous representing porn star Stormy Daniels and being a self-described “high-profile nemesis” of President Donald Trump. He has pleaded not guilty to illegally demanding millions of dollars from Nike last March in exchange for not publicizing allegations it made improper payments to top college basketball recruits, and for being hired to conduct an internal probe of Nike. Avenatti was then representing Gary Franklin, a youth basketball coach who he said had information about improper payments. Nike has denied wrongdoing. The Beaverton, Oregon-based company on Thursday asked that Avenatti not be allowed to have five of its sports marketing officials testify at trial, calling their testimony irrelevant to the extortion claim. A trial is scheduled for Jan. 21 and could last three weeks. In Friday’s filing, Avenatti’s lawyers said it “logically makes no difference” why he hoped for payment by Nike, “whether to pay off debts, travel the world, or save up for a rainy day.” They also said evidence Avenatti was behind on child and spousal support, a claim he denied, was inadmissible, especially given the lack of agreement over whether he was behind at all. “The prejudice, confusion, and undue waste of time associated with such a circus would be significant,” the lawyers said. Avenatti has also pleaded not guilty to criminal charges in Manhattan that he cheated Daniels out of proceeds from a book contract, and in California that he defrauded clients out of millions of dollars. Daniels has said she had an affair with Trump before he became the U.S. president. Trump has denied having the affair. The case is U.S. v. Avenatti, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 19-cr-00373."

In a statement to Reuters late on Wednesday, Avenatti denied those claims and dismissed them as “bogus”. “Any claim that I was $15 million in debt is completely bogus, ludicrous and absurd. I can’t wait for the trial in this case, at which point the TRUTH and FACTS will come out and I will be fully exonerated,” Avenatti said in an emailed statement. Last week, Avenatti, 48, pleaded not guilty to an indictment accusing him of trying to extort up to $25 million from Nike by threatening to go public with claims the company made improper payments to athletes. The celebrity lawyer is accused by prosecutors of demanding money from the athletic wear company in exchange for agreeing to scrap a threatened news conference to discuss Nike’s alleged improper payments to elite college basketball recruits. A trial is scheduled for late in January. Nike, which has denied wrongdoing, did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on Wednesday. Since his March 25 arrest in the Nike case, Avenatti has defended himself against a variety of criminal charges. He has pleaded not guilty in Manhattan to stealing about $300,000 from Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, after helping her secure a book contract. He has also pleaded not guilty in California to wire fraud, bank fraud and other crimes, including stealing from clients."
-32.335802490724866," Wall Street analysts bullish over Nike's digital growth, look past margin weakness (Reuters) - Wall Street analysts were upbeat about Nike Inc's NKE.N long-term growth, encouraged by the sportswear maker's robust online sales and strength in China that helped overcome slowing demand in North America, its biggest market. At least eight brokerages boosted their price target on the Dow-component’s stock on Friday, with Deutsche Bank making the most bullish move by raising it to $120, above Nike’s current share price of about $100. “Given Nike’s significant scale and IT spend advantage, coupled with its early lead in digital, we remain very bullish on the company’s ability to continue to maintain its momentum in digital,” said Evercore ISI analyst Omar Saad. Still, shares of the company were down about 1.5% in early trade as investors worried about its weak margins and growing competition in North America from Adidas ADSGn.DE, Skechers SKX.N and VF Corp's VFC.N Vans. In efforts to win market share from rivals, Nike has collaborated with celebrities, launched limited edition sneakers, spent on technology and increased marketing around major sporting events. The company’s sales have also got a boost in recent years from its “Consumer Direct Offense” strategy that includes focus on online sales, product launches and supply chain improvements to bring new products to shelves faster. Overall, quarterly sales rose a better-than-expected 10.2%, with its famous Jordan brand hitting $1 billion in sales for the first time. North America sales rose 5%, but came in slightly below expectations. The company’s margins came under pressure in the quarter from increased investments, but several analysts attributed much of the weakness to currency fluctuations. “Despite (the weak margins), Nike remains the envy of the rest of the sector,” Deutsche Bank analyst Paul Trussell said. “With the product pipeline robust today and still ramping, heading towards Tokyo Olympics 2020, we see above-average top- and bottom-line gains ahead.” At least 23 of 31 brokerages rate the stock “buy” or higher, 6 “hold” and 2 “sell” or lower. Shares of Nike were at $99.65 in early trading. The stock has risen 36% this year, outperforming the Dow Jones Industrial Average's .DJI 22% rise."

-30.2667711365122," Nike quarterly results beat, but North America disappoints (Reuters) - Nike Inc's NKE.N quarterly revenue and profit blew past Wall Street expectations on Thursday on strong sales in China, but lower-than-expected growth in North America, its biggest market, overshadowed the beat. The world's largest footwear maker faces intense competition from brands like Adidas ADSGn.DE, Skechers SKX.N and VF Corp's VFC.N Vans in North America, even as it pushes to sell exclusive merchandise through its tap-and-buy SNKRS app and retail stores. In its attempt to gain market share over rivals, Nike has collaborated with celebrities, ramped up sneaker launches and increased marketing around major sporting events. In November, the company ended a two-year-old partnership with Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O to sell Nike's merchandise directly on the online retailer's website, to focus more on sneaker launches on its own digital platforms. Nike’s revenue from North America rose 5.3% to $3.98 billion in the second quarter, compared with the previous year’s 9% rise, but missed Wall Street expectations of $4 billion. “The comparisons are getting tougher in North America. It’s partially that - this recovery for the Nike brand started last year and it really accelerated (that time),” Telsey Advisory Group analyst Cristina Fernandez said. The company’s gross margin of 44% was also slightly below estimates of 44.1%, hurt by higher product costs due to incremental tariffs in North America. Nike's shares, which hit a record high in regular trading on Thursday, were down about 2% after the closing bell. They have risen 36.4% this year, outpacing the 22% gain in the blue-chip Dow Jones index .DJI. In Greater China, the fastest-growing market for Nike, revenue rose 20% to $1.85 billion. The company recently introduced its app in the country, which outgoing Chief Executive Officer Mark Parker said on Thursday was downloaded 1 million times. Parker will be stepping down in the new year, handing over control to John Donahoe, the former CEO of online marketplace eBay EBAY.O and cloud computing company ServiceNow NOW.N. Nike’s net income jumped 31.6% to $1.12 billion, or 70 cents per share, in the quarter ended Nov. 30, while analysts on average had expected 58 cents per share. Overall revenue rose 10.2% to $10.33 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of $10.09 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv."

-29.720249106495643," Michael Avenatti pleads not guilty to new Nike extortion indictment NEW YORK (Reuters) - Michael Avenatti pleaded not guilty on Tuesday to an indictment accusing him of trying to extort as much as $25 million from Nike Inc NKE.N by threatening to go public with claims the company made improper payments to athletes. Clasping his hands behind his back, the celebrity lawyer, who gained fame representing porn actress Stormy Daniels in a lawsuit against U.S. President Donald Trump, said “not guilty” after U.S. District Judge Paul Gardephe read each of the three counts against him in Manhattan federal court. Avenatti declined to comment after the hearing. Prosecutors have accused Avenatti, 48, of demanding money from Nike in exchange for agreeing to scrap a threatened news conference to discuss the athletic wear company’s alleged improper payments to elite college basketball recruits. A trial is scheduled for Jan. 21, 2020, and could last the rest of January. Nike has denied wrongdoing. Since his March 25 arrest in the Nike case, Avenatti has defended himself against a variety of criminal charges. Avenatti has pleaded not guilty in Manhattan to stealing about $300,000 from Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, after helping her secure a book contract. He has also pleaded not guilty in California to wire fraud, bank fraud and other crimes, including stealing from clients. The amended Nike indictment dropped two conspiracy counts but added a charge of honest services fraud. Prosecutors said Avenatti failed to reveal that Nike had offered to settle with his client, youth basketball coach Gary Franklin, so long as the Beaverton, Oregon-based company did not have to pay Avenatti himself. At Tuesday’s hearing, Avenatti’s lawyer, Scott Srebnick, said that charge should be dismissed, citing a 2010 Supreme Court decision involving former Enron Corp Chief Executive Jeffrey Skilling limiting the claim to bribery and kickback cases. “The government’s whole theory was that Avenatti was shaking down Nike,” but its case has “morphed” into alleged bribery solicitation, Srebnick said. “It’s hard to know from this indictment exactly what this bribery scheme was.” Gardephe did not rule on the motion. The judge also said he was “inclined” to let an expert witness testify for the prosecution about legal ethics rules, though not whether Avenatti violated them. Prospective jurors are expected to receive questionnaires in advance about the case. “Given how much press there has been about Mr. Avenatti, it seems obvious to me that a questionnaire is necessary,” he said. The case is U.S. v. Avenatti, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 19-cr-00373."

-12.715136727502124," Skechers' 'cool' value gives it room to run like Nike: Barron's NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shoemaker Skechers USA Inc SKX.N is expected to post earnings growth on pace with Nike Inc NKE.N over the next three years, giving its relatively low valuation a chance of catching up, financial newspaper Barron's reported in its Dec. 7 edition. Analysts estimate Skechers’ earnings-per-share will rise 15% this year and in 2020, and 12% in 2021. Yet Nike trades at about 30 times analysts’ future earnings estimates, compared with 16 times for Sketchers, even after Skechers shares soared more than 75% this year, the paper said. Skechers sells trainers, dress shoes, sandals and boots - a broader range than Nike - and has grown over the past 20 years to become the third-largest global footwear brand by revenue, after Nike and Adidas AG ADSGn.DE, the paper said. Skechers styles, often priced at $50 to $70, are perceived as “cool” and good value, an edge its bigger rivals lack, Barron’s added. “Nike and Adidas are reluctant to identify as value brands, giving Skechers room to run,” Barron’s said."
-4.130938477999185," Athletics: UKA launches review into handling of Nike Oregon Project issues LONDON (Reuters) - UK Athletics (UKA) has commissioned an independent review into the processes under which issues concerning the Nike Oregon Project (NOP) were investigated in 2015 and 2017 after distance-running coach Alberto Salazar was banned for four years, it said on Thursday. American Salazar was banned in September by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) for “orchestrating and facilitating prohibited doping conduct” as head coach of the NOP. The NOP was set up mainly to develop U.S. endurance runners but athletes from other countries, including Britain’s Olympic 5,000 and 10,000 meters champion Mo Farah, also trained there. ""UKA ... commissioned the independent review to review the processes under which the issues concerning the NOP were investigated in 2015 and 2017 and the subsequent related decisions made by the UKA board at those respective times,"" the national governing body said in a statement here. “The independent review will also set out any recommendations to assist UKA ensure its future governance and assurance framework is robust.” The review aims to address questions such as whether the UKA sought advice from UK Sport, UK Anti-Doping (UKAD) and USADA in relation to the issues that came up and whether informed decisions were made based on evidence available at the time. UKA said in October that its 2015 investigation, which cleared Farah to work with Salazar, was “restricted to the interaction of the Nike Oregon Project with Mo Farah and not an anti-doping investigation”. UKA chairman Chris Clark said his organization would publish its findings early next year. “The UKA Board recognizes the seriousness of the USADA decision released at the start of October,” Clark said. “It has unanimously agreed that an independent review should now be carried out. “We need to ensure we have a clear way forward that gives us confidence in the integrity of our coaching efforts,” he added. “If there are lessons to be learned, we plan to implement any recommendations into a future focused, transparent and accountable way of working.” The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) said this month that it had registered an appeal from Salazar, who has denied any wrongdoing, with hearings unlikely to take place before March 2020."
13.73964132728137," Michael Avenatti faces new fraud charge in Nike extortion case NEW YORK (Reuters) - Federal prosecutors on Wednesday unveiled a new fraud charge against lawyer Michael Avenatti, accusing him of lying to a client as part of his alleged effort to extort Nike Inc NKE.N. The prosecutors also dropped two counts of conspiracy against Avenatti from the case, which was first made public in March, according to a superseding indictment filed in federal court in Manhattan. “I am extremely pleased that the two counts alleging I engaged in a conspiracy against Nike have just been dismissed by Trump’s DOJ,” Avenatti wrote on Twitter, referring to the U.S. Department of Justice under President Donald Trump. “I expect to be fully exonerated when it is all said and done.” “It is obvious the government’s case is falling apart, it should never have been filed,” Avenatti added in a message to Reuters. Avenatti, 48, became famous for representing porn star Stormy Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, in lawsuits involving Trump and his former personal lawyer Michael Cohen. He also faces federal charges in Manhattan of stealing about $300,000 from Daniels after helping her secure a book contract. Prosecutors had previously charged Avenatti with extortion, accusing him of threatening to publicize a claim by one of his clients, a basketball club coach, that Nike arranged for payments to elite college basketball recruits. Avenatti demanded that the athletic wear company pay the coach $1.5 million and pay himself more than $20 million, prosecutors said. The new indictment adds a claim that Avenatti defrauded the coach. Prosecutors said Avenatti concealed the fact that Nike agreed to pay the coach to settle the case as long as it did not have to pay Avenatti, and instead continued trying to use the case for his own benefit. Federal prosecutors in Southern California have separately charged Avenatti with wire fraud, bank fraud and other crimes, saying he stole millions of dollars from clients. Avenatti has pleaded not guilty to all the charges against him."

10.811228423574985," In a Nike factory in Argentina's hinterland, the ghost of Macri's fall ELDORADO, Argentina (Reuters) - Rumors of layoffs started spreading among workers at a factory here in northeastern Argentina making Nike Inc NKE.N shoes the night before Cristian Fredy Aquino's scheduled shift. When his key card for the turnstile failed, Aquino realized the rumors were true. The plant was cutting hundreds of workers as orders from the U.S. apparel giant stalled, amid a swirling economic crisis that has plunged the country into recession for most of the last year. The Nike factory in Misiones province, one of Argentina’s poorest, is proving to be the tip of the iceberg. Around Argentina, nearly 16,000 textile and shoe factory workers have lost their jobs in the last year, according to government data, including nearly a quarter of all shoe sector workers. And the outlook is darkening: the peso currency has tumbled, interest rates are above 60% and annual inflation nearly 54%. In this lush jungle town with dusty red-dirt roads, laid-off workers, union delegates and locals Reuters spoke with on a recent trip had one person to blame: President Mauricio Macri, who was defeated outright in a general election on Sunday. Macri, who came to power in late 2015 as a business-friendly candidate to industry cheers, moved to cut trade barriers, helping bolster overseas ties and increase competition for domestic suppliers. That compounded an unexpectedly sharp economic downturn since last year that has hammered consumer spending inside the country. At the Nike plant in Eldorado that meant the factory was up against a wave of cheaper imports even as local manufacturing costs got higher. As costs rose, importing finished products became a more attractive option, industry experts said. “It’s just another job the government is getting rid of,” Aquino said of his first thought upon learning that the owner of the Misiones plant, Brazil’s Dass Group, was cutting workers last December. Aquino spoke to Reuters on the porch of the modest brick house where he lives with his wife and two children. He said his home was possible thanks to the previous government of Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, vice-president on the winning ticket on Sunday. “I worked seven and a half years for the company. With my earnings, I could eat and support my family,” said Aquino, who said he has since taken on an informal job as a driver to make ends meet. “I can’t let my children be in need.” Nike declined to comment on the reason for cutting back on its orders at the Misiones plant, but said in a statement it “continues to evaluate our sourcing strategy based on seasonal needs and the local marketplace.” Representatives from Dass Group, the Brazilian company that runs the factory, and the shoe workers’ union, UTICRA, both blamed the job cuts on a steep 70% drop in shoe orders from Nike, which accounts for nearly all the factory’s work. The dynamics in Eldorado are a key reason Argentina’s left-leaning Peronists have toppled market-friendly conservative Macri, whose popularity was hit as industries from carmakers to vinters in the country have reeled from falling sales. “Production is down because of what is happening in the country, a drastic fall in consumption. It’s a reality that is affecting us all,” said Dario Vera, the factory’s delegate for shoe workers’ union UTICRA. He said the sector had taken a turn for the worse in recent years under Macri's more open-door policies, such as slashing red tape that required importers to seek authorization from the national revenue service. Vera pointed to another factory closure in Chivilcoy near Buenos Aires last December after Nike-rival Adidas AG ADSGn.DE cut back orders. The union, he said, was now supporting Fernandez, who has pledged to support domestic industry and revive local consumption, and could roll back some of Macri’s free-trade policies to appease powerful worker unions. The malaise in Misiones, a province sandwiched between Brazil and Paraguay, reflects a wider struggle for Argentina’s clothing and textile sectors, which have been hit by a 14.6% drop in retail sales in the first seven months of 2019, according to government data based on shopping mall purchases. Around the country, the textile and shoe sectors employ 107,000 people, the latest labor ministry data show, down around 13% over the last year. The shoe segment is down 23%. There were over 1.4 million unemployed people in Argentina in the second quarter of the year, an increase of 200,000 people versus the same period in 2018, government data show. “With high tax pressure on the sector, plus recession and a very high interest rate, all that combined... means the sector produces less,” said Jose Depena, director of the finance department at the University of CEMA in Buenos Aires. He said that the mainly small and medium-sized firms which make up the bulk of the sector were very capital intensive, with little automation to cut costs. That means locally-made clothes often come with a high price-tag in the South American country, which has driven demand for cheaper imports that have risen steadily since 2015, hitting a peak last year of $331 million, industry data show. “Making textiles here is unbearable because we have so many steps in the middle,” said Gabriel Cures Sastre of Buenos Aires-based trade-focused consultancy GCS Commercial. “Cutting the fabric, sewing it, doing the glue for the pockets. All of these processes end up as high added-value and the product becomes very expensive.” ‘INDISCRIMINATE IMPORTS’ Vera, the Eldorado factory’s delegate for UTICRA, said in recent years Nike had started importing 20,000 pairs of shoes daily - nearly the same amount the plant once produced. The union has called for rules to avoid “indiscriminate imports.” “In Eldorado, we are living a complex, sad situation. Being in a city that’s not very big and being away from the big cities is a difficult situation for us,” said Vera. At its peak, the factory employed 1,500 workers and churned out 23,000 pairs of Nike shoes per day for the domestic market, factory officials said. It was the largest of 12 Nike manufacturers in Argentina, Nike’s own manufacturing map shows. Now production has dwindled to just 7,000 pairs daily. Around 400 workers have lost their jobs since the layoffs started in December last year. Another 300 are set to be let go as soon as this week and hundreds more by the end of the year as orders dwindle further, Vera said. Flavio Eduardo Olea, human resources and labor relations manager at the factory, said the plant was pursuing talks with Nike to stem the decline, but things were looking grim - a reflection of Argentina’s challenge ahead to revive growth. “The company, with this amount of workers that are left, would be economically unfeasible,” he said."
12.512348558199182," Pence backs Hong Kong protests in China speech, slams NBA and Nike WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Mike Pence on Thursday accused China of curtailing “rights and liberties” in Hong Kong and blasted U.S. company Nike and the National Basketball Association for falling in line with Beijing in a disagreement over free speech. In a major policy speech on China that touched on an array of disputes ahead of talks with Beijing to ease a trade war, Pence said the United States does not seek confrontation or to “de-couple” from its main economic rival. But he pulled no punches when addressing some of the political rifts between the two countries. Criticizing China’s construction of a “surveillance state,” and “increasingly provocative” military action, Pence held up Taiwan’s Democracy as a better path for Chinese people and took Beijing to task for its handling of pro-democracy protests that have rocked Hong Kong for more than four months. “Hong Kong is a living example of what can happen when China embraces liberty,” he said. “And yet, for the last few years, Beijing has increased its interventions in Hong Kong and engaged in actions that curtail the rights and liberties that Hong Kong’s people were guaranteed through a binding international agreement.” He said the United States stands with the protesters in Hong Kong, millions of whom have taken to the streets in sometimes violent clashes over what they see as China’s tightening grip. “We stand with you, we are inspired by you. We urge you to stay on the path of non-violent protest,” Pence said in his address at a Washington think tank. He also slammed China for its treatment of Muslim Uighurs in the Xinjiang region. Pence directed some of his harshest words at sports apparel giant Nike NKE.N and the NBA, which he accused of siding with China's Communist Party over freedom of speech in Hong Kong. The vice president, who is often the face of the Trump administration’s tougher policies on China, said the NBA and Nike had failed to defend basketball team Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey, after he tweeted support of Hong Kong protesters earlier this month. “Some of the NBA’s biggest players and owners, who routinely exercise their freedom to criticize this country, lose their voices when it comes to the freedom and rights of other peoples,” he said. By “siding with the Chinese Communist Party and silencing free speech, the NBA is acting like a wholly owned subsidiary of the authoritarian regime,” Pence said. Nike stores in China removed Rockets merchandise after Beijing criticized Morey, Pence noted. “Nike promotes itself as a so-called social-justice champion, but when it comes to Hong Kong, it prefers checking its social conscience at the door,” he said. Pence said “far too many American multinational corporations have kowtowed to the lure of China’s money and markets by muzzling not only criticism of the Chinese Communist Party, but even affirmative expressions of American values.” Nike, the NBA and the Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to requests for comment about the remarks. Influential Chinese state-backed newspaper the Global Times, however, said in an editorial that while Pence reiterated many of his previous criticisms, there was still “room for optimism.” “He emphasized the U.S. does not want to ‘decouple’ and repeated how U.S. President Donald Trump is willing to start a new future with China,” it said. The closely watched speech set a discordant tone just weeks before a summit in Chile where U.S. President Donald Trump hopes to finalize a partial trade deal with China’s Xi Jinping. The S&P 500 U.S. stock index briefly moved lower after his comments. Analysts said Pence’s speech appeared aimed at keeping the way open for a trade deal while seeking to convince Trump’s support base that he was tough on China going into the 2020 election. Douglas Paal, a China expert with Washington’s Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, called it “a superficial and political speech, not a guiding strategic document.” Scott Kennedy, of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, saw it as an bid to provide rationale for “policy moves on security, economics and politics which originally were much less coordinated and less integrated.” A new round of talks between Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and Chinese officials to try to end the bruising trade dispute is set for Friday. The United States launched a trade war with China 15 months ago, alleging unfair trading practices such as theft of U.S. intellectual property and generous industrial subsidies at the expense of foreign competitors. Fears of antagonizing Beijing had prompted the White House to postpone Pence’s speech, which was originally scheduled for June, ahead of a meeting Trump and Xi aimed at getting trade talks back on track. Many China watchers had expected Pence to tread lightly on sensitive topics on Thursday, in sharp contrast to the bombastic tone of his first major China policy address a year ago. But some saw signs of a rapprochement as well. “In contrast to the Hudson Institute speech of October 2018, the Vice President’s equally hard-hitting Wilson speech offered the beginnings of a positive vision for U.S.-China relations,” said Robert Daly of the Kissinger Institute on China. Pence said the United States was “not seeking to contain China’s development.” “We want a constructive relationship with China’s leaders,” he said, calling on Beijing to “seize this unique moment in history to start anew by ending the trade practices that have taken advantage of the American people for far too long.”"
9.584358610695528," Nike's Parker hands over CEO role to former eBay chief (Reuters) - Nike Inc's NKE.N long-time chief executive officer, Mark Parker, will step down next year and be replaced by board member and former eBay CEO John Donahoe, who will be tasked with strengthening the sportswear maker's online strategy. Donahoe, who has been on Nike's board since 2014, will join the sneaker maker from cloud computing firm ServiceNow Inc NOW.N, where he was CEO for more than four years. Prior to that, he led online retailer eBay EBAY.O for the seven years through 2015. Nike’s Parker had said last year he would remain CEO and chairman of the footwear maker beyond 2020, with his remarks coming in the midst of a series of executive departures and probes on workplace complaints. The move comes days after the world’s biggest footwear maker shut down its Nike Oregon Project training group, following the recent four-year ban of the center’s founder and coach Alberto Salazar by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA). Nike did not give any reason for Parker’s exit from the top job. In an interview to CNBC, Parker said the change was unrelated to the Oregon Project or any other issues. Parker joined Nike as one of its first footwear designers in 1979, and held several roles during his tenure at the company before taking charge as its top boss in 2006. Credited with creating the popular Nike Air sneakers as well as other pioneering products, Parker, in the past few years, oversaw Nike’s shift to selling directly to customers online and its success in international markets, particularly China. He will become Nike’s executive chairman and continue to lead the board after Donahoe takes over as CEO. “We like that (Donahoe) comes from technology and that he comes from the digital space and we like that he is a strategist and a leader ... things that have made Nike positive have been because of those sort of strengths,” Jane Hali & Associates analyst Jessica Ramirez said. Nike’s digital revenue surged 35% in the last fiscal year, with the company expecting online sales to account for about a third of its business by 2023. Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said Donahoe’s e-commerce experience could help with Nike’s online push, while Parker could focus more on product development, one of his key strengths. During Parker’s tenure, Nike’s stock surged more than nine-folds. They were marginally higher in extended trading on Tuesday. Over the past year, however, Parker faced a number of speedbumps as he chased his target of $50 billion in annual sales. He apologised to staff last year after a series of workplace complaints at the company. Nike also came under fire for featuring an ad with former NFL player Colin Kaepernick, who sparked a national controversy by kneeling during the national anthem. “Nike has had their fair share of scandals and issues ... and they didn’t really go out and look externally. It definitely seems like it could be part of” the Oregon scandal, Yarbrough said, referring to Parker’s departure. Separately, ServiceNow said it appointed Bill McDermott as its CEO. McDermott helmed software maker SAP from 2014 until recently. ServiceNow shares fell about 16% on the news. McDermott stood down earlier this month after a decade building up SAP SAPG.DE as the world's leading enterprise software company, handing the task of completing its transition to cloud computing to new co-CEOs Jennifer Morgan and Christian Klein. Earlier in the day, Nike rival Under Armour Inc UAA.N said its founder and CEO Kevin Plank would step down, giving his responsibilities to Patrik Frisk, a company insider, hoping a change in leadership will help battle brutal competition from Nike and Adidas in the United States."

9.584358610695528," Under Armour CEO to step aside after two decades; insider to replace (Reuters) - Under Armour Inc UAA.N founder Kevin Plank will hand the reins of the sportswear maker to operations head Patrik Frisk, hoping a change in leadership will help battle brutal competition from Nike and Adidas in the United States. Plank has been the company’s chief executive for more than two decades, turning it into a popular name in sportswear, but struggling to generate consistent sales growth. He brought in Frisk in 2017 from footwear and accessories company Aldo Group to help steer a turnaround plan that included store closures, job cuts and fewer promotions to bolster profit margins. “We view his capabilities as an operator favorably, and believe the regime will have continuity from Plank’s leadership,” Stifel analyst Jim Duffy said. Duffy added the change in leadership would not lead to any immediate strategy changes for Under Armour. Frisk will continue to report to Plank, who will stay on as executive chairman and brand chief, Under Armour said. Plank also has a majority voting control of the company as he beneficially owns all outstanding Class B common stock, which has 10 votes per share. Frisk will take over at the start of next year and will be tasked with propping up the company’s sales in the United States, where it has been introducing products such as new Curry sneaker and HOVR shoes at a faster pace to shore up market share. In an interview with CNBC on Tuesday, Frisk said the rebound in its North America business would take time. Shares of the company, which have risen nearly 14% this year, rose 3% on Tuesday following the announcement."
7.758076049963844," Athletics: Shutting down Nike Oregon Project the 'right thing' - USADA CHICAGO (Reuters) - The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) has praised the decision to shut down the Nike Oregon Project (NOP), saying on Friday it was a necessary step after the elite distance running program’s leader, Alberto Salazar, was suspended for doping violations. Nike on Thursday shuttered the famed program, with its stable of elite competitors who added to the company’s authority in the world of distance running, calling it a “distraction” for its athletes. Salazar was given a four-year doping ban by USADA on Sept. 30 but has denied wrongdoing and plans to appeal. USADA CEO Travis Tygart said shutting down the NOP program was “the right thing” to do. “Now let’s hope they accept that mistakes were made and truly commit to clean sport and the health, well-being of athletes,” he said. Nike declined to comment on the USADA statement but reiterated that the decision to fold the NOP was done “to allow the athletes to focus on their training and competition needs. “This situation including uninformed innuendo and unsubstantiated assertions has become an unfair burden for current OP athletes,” a Nike spokesperson said. “We will continue to support Alberto in his appeal.” The decision to close the program came two days before the Chicago Marathon, with NOP athletes Galen Rupp, the race’s 2017 champion, and women’s contender Jordan Hasay among the favorites. Hasay, who was coached by Salazar, said she found out about the shutdown on Thursday but was staying “laser-focused” on Sunday’s marathon. “That was unfortunate news,” said Hasay. “I don’t know if it was to be expected but it is what it is.” Neither Rupp nor Hasay have been accused of any wrongdoing. Despite the void left by the closure of the Nike program, analysts said the company should be able to weather the controversy with its brand relatively intact. “I’d call this a minor sprain for Nike,” said Bob Dorfman, a sports marketing expert at Baker Street Advertising. Regarding the company’s competitors, he said that while the controversy “may help Adidas continue to close the wide earnings gap,” Nike still reigns supreme. “Nike still dominates the running category, sponsors the large majority of top track and field athletes, and makes shoes that people want.”"
7.758076049963844," Houston Rockets Nike merchandise disappears from China stores BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Houston Rockets sneakers and other merchandise were pulled from several Nike NKE.N stores in major Chinese cities amid the furor surrounding a tweet from the team's general manager in support of anti-government protests in Hong Kong. Managers at five Nike stores in Beijing and Shanghai told Reuters during visits on Thursday they had been told in recent days via a memo from management that all Rockets merchandise had to be removed. Reuters was unable to view the memo. Although Rockets general manager Daryl Morey has since apologized for his tweet last week, National Basketball Association (NBA) Commissioner Adam Silver further angered authorities when he said the league backed Morey’s right to exercise his freedom of expression. Despite the controversy, the NBA was pressing ahead with an exhibition game between the Los Angeles Lakers and Brooklyn Nets in Shanghai on Thursday night. Promotional events earlier in the week had been canceled. The stakes are high for NBA, whose league business in China is said to be worth more than $4 billion. The world’s most populous nation is Nike’s top source of revenue growth as other regions slow. Three Nike stores in Shenzhen also kept Rockets merchandise off the shelves, as well as NBA products in general, staff told Reuters by phone. Three Nike stores in Chengdu, a bustling inland city in southwest China, also removed Rockets products. Nike and its China office did not respond to multiple Reuters requests for comment. A specialist NBA store at Super Brand Mall, a major shopping center in the Shanghai financial district of Lujiazui, has also removed all Rockets-related merchandise. “Other stuff, there hasn’t been any impact, and no one has said we need to withdraw it,” said a store manager, laughing. “If they say that all NBA stuff has to be withdrawn then our store will go bankrupt.” At two basketball-themed NBA Playzone family entertainment centers in Shanghai and Beijing opened by NBA China, staff confirmed that Rockets products had been removed. “Rockets products were hot before and when you stepped into the store, it was full of red. Now, it is mostly yellow and blue,” the colors of the Golden State Warriors, said a manager at the Shanghai Playzone, who like the NBA store employee declined to be identified because of the sensitivity of the issue. NBA China did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment about the entertainment centers. Major Chinese e-commerce platforms Alibaba BABA.N and JD.com JD.O have taken Houston Rockets merchandise off their sales platforms, including mobile apps. Searches for sneakers with the NBA logo on Alibaba and JD.com also yielded no results. Those include collaboration sneakers marketed with brands such as Nike and Carlyle-backed CG.O Supreme. A handful of individual online merchants still sell the sneakers. Alibaba, which declined to comment, told domestic media that Morey’s comments had seriously hurt the feelings of the Chinese people, and that there was no room for negotiation. JD.com, which also did not comment, told local media that the firm deeply resented and strongly condemned Morey’s remarks. Two of the largest online resale marketplaces for sneakers in China have also removed all branded shoes connected to the NBA, according to four sneaker traders. Poizon and DoNew, two mobile shopping apps popular among fans of designer sneakers, have taken NBA shoes off their platforms, traders said. A Reuters search on Poizon and DoNew’s apps with the keyword “NBA” returned no results. Poizon did not respond to an emailed request for comment and phone calls to DoNew’s office in Shanghai went unanswered. “As long as the bosses of Nike and Adidas don’t come out and say something stupid and get banned by China’s central government, I think sneaker resales in China will remain pretty profitable,” said Zhu Junwen, a reseller in Guangzhou. Adidas ADSGn.DE is in the middle of a reported $200 million, 13-year endorsement contract with Houston Rockets star guard James Harden, who is the centrepiece of the apparel maker's basketball shoe lineup. “But if (Nike and Adidas get banned), that would be the end of it,” Zhu said."
7.758076049963844," Nike shuts down Oregon Project after ban of coach (Reuters) - Nike Inc shut down its Nike Oregon Project training group on Thursday, following the recent four-year ban of founder and coach Alberto Salazar by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA). The Nike Oregon Project (NOP) was a camp designed primarily to develop U.S. endurance athletes and Salazar, a celebrated distance runner who had won three consecutive New York City marathons from 1980, had been its head coach. Nike Chief Executive Mark Parker announced the move in a memo provided to Runner’s World magazine. “This situation, along with ongoing unsubstantiated assertions, is a distraction for many of the athletes and is compromising their ability to focus on their training and competition needs,” Parker said in the memo, according to the magazine. “I have therefore made the decision to wind down the Oregon Project.” The news of the project’s closure comes amidst preparations by Oregon Project athletes Jordan Hasay and Galen Rupp for Sunday’s Chicago Marathon. Nike will help athletes find new training arrangements, Parker said in the memo, adding that no evidence had been found that performance-enhancing drugs were ever used on Oregon Project athletes. Salazar has appealed against the ban for doping violations was announced on Sept. 30, which included violations for trafficking and tampering. Salazar has been unable to coach during the appeal process."

Democratic lawmakers late Tuesday moved to launch an impeachment inquiry into Trump, and indexes weakened briefly early in the day after the White House released a summary of a telephone call between Trump and Ukraine’s president that is at the center of the impeachment inquiry. The Ukrainian president said he was not pushed by Trump to investigate a political rival. Helping sentiment, data showed that sales of new U.S. single-family homes rebounded more than expected in August, a sign that the struggling housing market was starting to get a lift from lower borrowing rates. “Good economic data is fighting with political noise and good data is winning,” said Michael Antonelli, market strategist at Robert W. Baird in Milwaukee. Adding to bullish sentiment, Trump said a trade deal with China could happen sooner than expected, comments that were in contrast to his harsh rhetoric on Tuesday on the dispute. Nike Inc shares jumped 4.2% after the company’s first-quarter results beat market expectations. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 170.69 points, or 0.64%, to 26,978.46, the S&P 500 gained 18.76 points, or 0.63%, to 2,985.36 and the Nasdaq Composite added 86.81 points, or 1.09%, to 8,080.44.

Wall Street had a sluggish start after Democratic lawmakers moved to launch an impeachment inquiry into Trump, adding fresh uncertainty for markets already roiled by the U.S.-China trade tussle and worries over slowing global economic growth. Trump’s comments were in contrast to his harsh rhetoric on Tuesday on the trade dispute, which rattled global stock markets on Wednesday. “This is just part of his rhetoric, it changes one day to the next. We just have to wait and see if this will really happen,” said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities in New York.

11.191254358370314," No tariff fears for Nike after online success (Reuters) - Nike Inc's NKE.N online sales growth and a bullish outlook in China put it on a firm path for years to come and should help it easily ride out rises in U.S. import tariffs on its Chinese-made sneakers, Wall Street analysts said on Wednesday after a strong set of quarterly results. Shares in the world’s biggest sportswear maker surged as much as 5% in early trade after the results late on Tuesday showed its margins soaring and sales up 42% through apps and websites it has developed under its Nike Direct strategy. That signaled an end to a rough period marked by strong competition from German rival Adidas AG ADSGn.DE and prompted at least 11 Wall Street brokerages to raise price targets on its stock far above a current $87. Evercore ISI set a price target of $150, compared with a current Wall Street median of $100. One big question-mark over Nike has been whether it will be hit in its biggest growth market, China, by a backlash against American-branded goods in response to President Donald Trump’s rhetoric and successive rounds of import tariffs. Instead, Nike’s sales there grew 22% year-on-year, extending a run of double-digit growth that goes back five years. Analysts from another major brokerage, Credit Suisse, said China would be a source of growth for many years to come and Chief Financial Officer Andy Campion indicated the company was not experiencing any fallout with Chinese consumers. “Nike’s digital business grew over 70% in China in the first quarter,” Credit Suisse analysts said. “And we’d note that this outsized digital growth was without the benefit of the Nike App launch.” Campion said the company would be launching the App in its second quarter ending in November, earlier than previously planned. Footwear made by Nike and its peers, Adidas and Puma SE PUMG.DE, fell under the Trump administration's latest set of tariffs imposed on Sept. 1. But as well as the bullish results, several of the brokerages laid out a range of different tools Nike would be able to use to either avoid tariffs being applied to some goods, change sourcing or pass more costs onto suppliers and retailers. “We remain confident that Nike can effectively manage List 4 tariffs due to its sophisticated supply chain and leverage with vendors,” Telsey Advisory Group analysts said in a note.

15.165509661051171," Nike's first quarter shines as direct-to-consumer push gains momentum (Reuters) - Nike Inc's NKE.N quarterly revenue and profit beat market expectations on Tuesday as a push to sell sneakers and apparels to consumers through its own stores and online retailers gained pace, boosting margins and sending its shares up 5%. Wall Street has been bullish about Nike ever since the world’s largest footwear maker unveiled “Nike Direct,” a strategy to focus on online sales, product launches and supply chain improvements to bring new products to shelves faster. Nike has also launched pop-up stores that cater to “sneakerheads” or loyal fans of the brand in several big U.S. cities and opened flagships in New York and Beijing to build a strong relationship with its customers. These efforts helped the company sell more products at full price, driving a 150 basis points expansion in gross margins in the first quarter to 45.7%, well above analysts’ expectations. “When they sell through their own website, that’s a very strong margin and that’s growing very rapidly, becoming a bigger and bigger part of the business,” Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said. Nike said it expects gross margin to increase by roughly 25 basis points in the second quarter, when the impact of tariffs on Chinese imports are likely to be more pronounced. “We nonetheless expand gross margin over the balance of the fiscal year, though of course not to the same level as we saw in Q1,” Chief Financial Officer Andy Campion told analysts. Shares of the Oregon-based company were up at $91.80 in extended trading, putting them on course for a record open on Wednesday. (Graphic: ) Nike's popularity in China continued to power its revenue growth, especially at a time when rivals Adidas ADSGn.DE and Under Armour UAA.N ramps up in the United States, its biggest market. Chief Executive Officer Mark Parker said the company has seen double-digit growth in Greater China every quarter for more than five years, in part helped by its digital initiatives. Revenue from China rose 22% to $1.68 billion, but in North America it rose by a slower-than-expected 3.6%. The results “exemplify Nike’s persistent defiance of retail gravity, led by China”, CFRA analyst Camilla Yanushevsky said. Sales from its digital platform, which includes apps and websites, grew 42%. Overall revenue rose 7.2% to $10.66 billion and it earned 86 cents per share. Analysts were expecting revenue of $10.44 billion and profit of 70 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv."
15.165509661051171," Michael Avenatti withdraws request to subpoena Nike in U.S. extortion case NEW YORK (Reuters) - Michael Avenatti on Tuesday withdrew his request to subpoena Nike Inc in connection with the federal criminal case accusing the embattled lawyer of extortion, after the company said prosecutors already possessed all the documents he sought. The withdrawal came fewer than 24 hours after prosecutors called the subpoena a “fishing expedition” unrelated to the extortion case, which the U.S. Department of Justice announced in March. Avenatti has pleaded not guilty. Nike had also opposed the subpoena in a letter made public on Friday, and Avenatti’s lawyers said they did not know until then that the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of New York already had the documents they wanted. “Because Nike has now confirmed, for the first time, that the USAO-SDNY possesses all of the documents that Mr. Avenatti seeks from Nike -- and the USAO-SDNY accepts Nike’s representation -- we are withdrawing our request for a ... subpoena to Nike,” wrote Scott Srebnick, a lawyer for Avenatti. Srebnick said he will discuss with prosecutors which documents will be turned over and if necessary, file motions to obtain documents that might help Avenatti’s defense. Prosecutors accused Avenatti of threatening to publicize claims that Nike arranged for payments to elite college basketball recruits unless the athletic wear company paid him more than $20 million and hired him to manage an internal probe. Avenatti, 48, became famous for representing porn star Stormy Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, in lawsuits involving U.S. President Donald Trump and his former personal lawyer Michael Cohen. He also faces federal charges in Manhattan of stealing about $300,000 from Daniels after helping her secure a book contract. In a decision late Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Deborah Batts in Manhattan rejected Avenatti’s request to move that case to California, saying that two key witnesses, Daniels’ agent and her publisher, were in New York. Federal prosecutors in Southern California have separately charged Avenatti with wire fraud, bank fraud and other crimes, saying he stole millions of dollars from clients. Avenatti has also pleaded not guilty to charges in the Daniels and California cases, which he had argued were similar. He said in an email earlier Tuesday about the Nike case: “I look forward to a jury hearing the real truth as to what happened as opposed to the fairytale scripted by Trump’s DOJ.” The case is U.S. v. Avenatti, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 19-cr-00373."

The Washington Post reported that Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi would announce a formal impeachment inquiry of Trump, a Republican, later on Tuesday. Support amongst Democrats for the start of impeachment proceedings increased after news that Trump may have sought foreign help in smearing a political rival. Stocks briefly pared losses after Trump, in a tweet, said his administration would release a complete transcript of a call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy that is at the center of the controversy. He said the released transcript would show the call was “totally appropriate” and that he had not pressured Zelenskiy to investigate Democratic presidential hopeful Joe Biden and that there had been no quid pro quo for U.S. aid in exchange for a probe. “What all of that combined is going to do is ensure there is going to be elevated volatility in both directions in the next few days,” said Michael James, managing director of equity trading at Wedbush Securities in Los Angeles.

16.193769943315615," Lawyer Avenatti seeks to end 'vindictive' Nike prosecution he blames on Trump feud NEW YORK (Reuters) - Lawyer Michael Avenatti asked a federal judge to dismiss an indictment accusing him of trying to extort Nike Inc, saying he was targeted in a “vindictive and selective prosecution” because of his feud with U.S. President Donald Trump. In a Wednesday night court filing, Avenatti blamed the office of U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman in Manhattan for having “eschewed the typically careful and thoughtful fact-gathering investigation on which it historically prides itself” in its “zest to nab” him. Avenatti also said Trump and his family “have demonstrated genuine animus” toward him and that it was clear he would not have been prosecuted if not for that animus. A spokesman for Berman declined to comment on Thursday. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Avenatti, 48, became famous last year representing porn star Stormy Daniels, who said she had sex with Trump, in lawsuits involving the president and his now-imprisoned former personal lawyer Michael Cohen. Trump has denied Daniels’ claim. In March, Avenatti was accused of trying to extort more than $20 million from Nike by threatening to expose what he called its improper payments to recruits for college basketball teams it sponsored. Prosecutors said Avenatti agreed to back off only if the athletic wear company would pay $1.5 million to his whistleblower client, basketball coach Gary Franklin, and up to $25 million for him and the lawyer Mark Geragos to conduct a investigation. Nike has denied wrongdoing. Geragos has not been charged. Avenatti said his demands, made in obscenity-laden communications recorded at prosecutors’ behest after Nike approached them, were merely part of settlement negotiations and reflected his “zealous advocacy” for Franklin. He said none of that seemed to matter to prosecutors who let his “aggressive” public persona, “long feud” with Trump and brief involvement in Cohen’s prosecution color their actions. “If Mr. Avenatti were attorney Doe - or Mr. Geragos, for that matter - he would not have been arrested or charged,” Wednesday’s filing said. Prosecutors in Manhattan also have charged Avenatti with stealing about $300,000 from Daniels after helping her secure a book contract, to fund his extravagant lifestyle. Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, claimed to have received hush money not to discuss her alleged affair with Trump in 2006. Avenatti also faces charges in California of wire fraud, bank fraud and other crimes, including for defrauding other clients. He has pleaded not guilty to the various charges and could face more than 400 years in prison if convicted. The case is U.S. v. Avenatti, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 19-cr-00373."
9.89738388644455," Nike aims sneaker subscriber scheme at $10 billion U.S. kids market (Reuters) - Nike Inc will launch a new subscription service for kids sneakers this week that seeks to woo parents with an offer of fewer nightmarish trips to the shoe store in exchange for a regular fee and consistent brand loyalty. Aimed at the U.S. kids shoe market, estimated at an annual $10 billion, “Adventure Club” builds on Nike’s SNKRS app, which notifies shoppers every time it launches a new shoe or has an exclusive sneaker at a nearby store. It is Nike’s latest plan to keep shoppers coming back to its brands as it struggles with strong competition from Adidas in its U.S. home market and a resurgence in retro brands like Fila and Reebok. With three tiers of subscription – $20, $30 or $50 a month – Nike Adventure Club is aimed at 2-year to 10-year olds and effectively gives subscribers a new pair of Nike sneakers that cost about $50 or more once a month, once every two months or once every three. Depending on whether the kids pick, for example, Nike Air Max or Converse sneakers, members will save almost nothing or up to $50 on each pair. “Solving the need for parents with kids aged 2-10 years means that we are going to start building relationships through kids,” the scheme’s manager for Nike, Dave Cobban, said. The big challenge, he admitted, was helping parents get the right shoe for kids with constantly growing feet without trips to the mall or a series of mailed returns. Nike’s subscription box will include a sizing chart in the form of a fridge magnet to help parents measure their children’s feet. The company said a pilot program with 10,000 members has shown that only a small proportion of parents get the size wrong. “About 15% of the first order is generally not the right size. When the (customer) makes the first order and it’s the wrong size, we allow (the customer) to immediately order a new shoe and the new shoe comes before you have to send back the old one,” he said. “The next time less than 5% make a mistake in ordering the right size on their second order and after that, it almost comes (down) to zero.” Walmart Inc and Macy’s are already using the subscription model for beauty products to keep consumers interested in a market that is flooded by online specialty retailers and Amazon.com Inc."
3.6960910368332622," Under Armour sales growth in North America trails Nike again; shares sink (Reuters) - Sportswear maker Under Armour Inc UA.NUAA.N on Tuesday cut its full-year revenue forecast for North America as demand at its stores and online faced pressure from relentless competition from bigger rivals Nike and Adidas. Shares of the company fell as much as 20% as it struggles to stand out in the United States, its biggest market, where it has been introducing products such as new Curry sneaker and HOVR shoes at a faster pace to shore up market share. Under Armour has also been opening more company-owned stores and beefing up its online business, but the strategy failed to deliver in the quarter, with North America sales falling 3%. In contrast, Nike reported a 7% rise in sales from the region in the last reported quarter. “With the sports apparel space becoming increasingly crowded, Under Armour needs to carve out a more distinct and edgy position,” said Neil Saunders, managing director at research firm GlobalData. Chief Operating Officer Patrik Frisk said in a post earnings call that while more customers visited its app and website, that did not translate into sales. “In direct-to-consumer, we’re experiencing softer than anticipated demand,” Frisk said, adding that sales volume at its stores were also weak. “There’s a lot of work that we’re putting into getting better from an e-commerce digital perspective.” Nike and Adidas have pumped money into its online businesses, which have been driving their strong results. While online sales for Adidas grew 40% in the latest reported quarter, Under Armour’s direct-to-consumer unit grew just 2% in the quarter. The Baltimore-based firm said it now expected a slight decline in North America revenue for fiscal 2019 compared with a prior forecast of flat revenue. However, it stuck to its overall growth target on higher demand for shoes and apparel abroad as higher spending in international markets powered growth in Europe and Asia Pacific. The company’s net loss narrowed to $17.3 million in the quarter ended June 30. Excluding certain items, Under Armour posted a loss of 3 cents per share, while analysts were expecting a loss of 5 cents. Net revenue rose about 1% to $1.19 billion roughly in line with analysts’ expectation. Class A shares of the company have risen 55% so far this year and were trading at $23.69, down 13%."
4.4395865624441075," Exclusive: Nike explores sale of surfwear brand Hurley - sources (Reuters) - Nike Inc NKE.N, the world's largest sportswear maker, is exploring options for its surfwear brand Hurley International, including its possible divestment, according to people familiar with the matter. Nike’s potential retrenchment from the surfwear market is emblematic of the stance of most major consumer companies towards the sector. Surf brands have lost their appeal among non-surfing consumers, who now prefer boutique brands and retro streetwear. Among the options that Nike is considering for Hurley is an outright sale of the Costa Mesa, California-born brand, the sources said, requesting anonymity because the deliberations are confidential. It is not clear how much Nike could fetch by selling Hurley. Nike declined to comment. Nike purchased Hurley from founder Bob Hurley in 2002 for an undisclosed sum in an effort to expand beyond athletic-focused apparel and into other sportswear for surfing, skating, and snowboarding. Bob Hurley founded the company in 1979 and achieved notoriety in the 1970s for shaping the surf board for world champion Wayne “Rabbit” Bartholomew. In the last few years, the burgeoning appetite for clothing associated with the beach lifestyle and culture waned, to the point that former global leader Quiksilver filed for bankruptcy in 2015 before being taken over by private equity firm Oaktree Capital Management OAK.N. Mainstream fashion has dropped surfwear in favor of athleisure, while emerging fashion is turning toward urban streetwear brands like Carlyle-backed Supreme, and throwback looks like the revived sportswear brand Fila and Champion. Last year, Boardriders Inc, the company behind Quiksilver, Roxy and DC Shoes that is owned by Oaktree, acquired its struggling Australian rival Billabong, owner of its namesake brand along with other lifestyle brands such as Element and VonZipper."
5.8089672914067965," Nike shoes race to $437,500 world record auction price for sneakers (Reuters) - A pair of 1972 running shoes, one of the first pairs made by Nike Inc, sold for $437,500 on Tuesday, shattering the record for a pair of sneakers at public auction. The so-called Nike “Moon Shoe,” designed by Nike co-founder and track coach Bill Bowerman for runners at the 1972 Olympics trials, was the top lot in the first-ever auction dedicated to sneakers at Sotheby’s auction house in New York. Sotheby’s said the price was a world auction record for a pair of sneakers. The buyer was Canadian investor and car collector Miles Nadal, who had previously paid $850,000 for 99 other pairs of rare or limited collection sneakers offered by Sotheby’s. The highest previous price fetched at public auction for sneakers was $190,373 in California in 2017 for a pair of signed Converse shoes said to have been worn by Michael Jordan in the 1984 Olympic basketball final, Sotheby’s said. Sotheby’s, better known for selling art works fetching tens of millions of dollars, teamed up with streetwear marketplace Stadium Goods to auction 100 pairs of the rarest sneakers ever produced in a venture that reflects their fast-growing status as collectibles. The handmade “Moon Shoe,” with a waffle sole pattern, was one of only 12 pairs ever made and the pair that were auctioned on Tuesday are the only ones known to exist in an unworn condition, Sotheby’s said. Nadal, the founder of investment firm Peerage Capital, said in a statement he was thrilled at his purchase, calling the “Moon Shoe” a “true historical artifact in sports history and pop culture.” “I think sneaker culture and collecting is on the verge of a breakout moment,” he added, saying he plans to display them, along with the other 99 pairs he acquired in a private sale last week, at his private automobile museum in Toronto. Nadal’s haul included 2011 and 2016 versions of the “Back to the Future Part II” limited-edition shoes by Nike that were inspired by the 1989 film starring Michael J. Fox, and limited-edition sneakers produced by Adidas, Air Jordan and rapper Kanye West’s Yeezy collection. Noah Wunsch, global head of eCommerce at Sotheby’s, said the sneaker auction brought together art, culture and fashion. “We are eager to see where this sale takes us, not only in future sneaker offerings, but also in other new luxury lifestyle areas,” Wunsch said."
6.757210561997537," Nike inks endorsement deal with basketball star Zion Williamson (Reuters) - Nike Inc NKE.N has signed Zion Williamson, the No. 1 NBA draft pick and rising 19-year-old basketball star, to its Jordan brand, the world's largest sportswear maker said on Tuesday. Williamson, the reigning college basketball player of the year, dominated in his only season at Duke University, breaking several school records, including most 25-point games by a freshman. The New Orleans Pelicans signed Williamson after picking him first overall in the National Basketball Association draft. Williamson, who has drawn comparisons to former NBA great and Hall of Famer Charles Barkley, is known for his athleticism. With his uncommon blend of leaping ability and wide, muscular build, Williamson churned out a string of highlight plays in his lone season at Duke, including 360-degree slam dunks, towering rebounds and stunning blocked shots. Terms of the deal were not disclosed by Nike. Its shares rose 1% to $86.81. The 6-foot-7-inch (2 meters), 285-pound (129.3 kg) forward was involved in a social media storm earlier this year after a Nike sneaker he was wearing split during a game causing him to suffer a mild knee sprain. Nike apologized for the malfunction. Former U.S. President Barack Obama was in attendance at that game in February against Duke rival University of North Carolina and later wished Williamson a speedy recovery in a tweet. Willamson’s signing with Nike comes as no surprise given the loyalty and reputation the company has in the basketball community, Jane Hali & Associates analyst Jessica Ramirez said. “His signing with Jordan just proves how important the brand is becoming for Nike as they continue to revive it,” she added. Nike’s Jordan Brand, named for retired basketball icon Michael Jordan, already counts NBA stars such as Russell Westbrook, Carmelo Anthony and Chris Paul in its roster. “He’s an essential part of the new talent that will help lead the brand into the future,” said Jordan, the six-time NBA champion and five-time league Most Valuable Player. Williamson made only a brief appearance in his NBA summer league debut earlier this month, but still wowed fans with a ferocious steal and dunk. Williamson plans to skip taking part in Team USA training camp later this summer to focus on preparing for Pelicans training camp, ESPN reported this week."
5.613248739803895," Nike goes ahead with investment in new Arizona manufacturing plant (Reuters) - Nike Inc NKE.N said on Thursday it will open a manufacturing facility in Goodyear, Arizona, with a likely investment of at least $184 million, going ahead with the site after the state of Arizona last week withdrew an incentive package following the footwear maker's cancellation of a controversial sneaker. Nike, which said the expansion is expected to generate more than 500 full-time jobs, made no mention of the loss of the $1 million incentive in its statement on the new facility. Nike responded to a request for comment with a referral to its statement announcing the new plant. Last week, Arizona Governor Doug Ducey, a Republican, withdrew the incentive for Nike to build the plant after the world’s largest sportswear maker canceled the release of a sneaker featuring a colonial-era version of the American flag, which critics say reflects links to slavery. Nike last week said it canceled the sneaker because it was concerned that it “could unintentionally offend and detract from the nation’s patriotic holiday.” The Beaverton, Oregon-based company is one of a slew of retailers that have faced major backlash over products that draw criticism for being racially insensitive. In December, Prada pulled products accused of depicting blackface. Arizona officials said financial incentives previously withdrawn have not been reinstated. Nike said that building renovations will begin later this summer and production of Nike Air soles is expected to start in early 2020."
7.475728726161089," Arizona cancels incentive for Nike plant after 'terrible decision' to recall sneaker: governor (Reuters) - Arizona’s governor on Tuesday withdrew a $1 million incentive for Nike Inc to build a plant in the state after the world’s largest sportswear maker canceled release of a sneaker featuring a colonial-era version of the American flag, which critics say reflects links to slavery. Governor Doug Ducey, a Republican, said Nike’s move was a “terrible decision.” Nike recalled the shoe after former NFL quarterback and Nike pitchman Colin Kaepernick asked the company not to sell a shoe with a symbol that he and others consider offensive because of its connection to an era of slavery, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday. Nike had planned to release a new version of the Air Max 1 sneaker ahead of the Fourth of July holiday that featured a version of the U.S. flag with 13 white stars representing the first U.S. colonies. The flag is commonly known as the “Betsy Ross flag.” “Words cannot express my disappointment at this terrible decision. I am embarrassed for Nike,” Ducey said in a series of tweets on the recall. “Instead of celebrating American history the week of our nation’s independence, Nike has apparently decided that Betsy Ross is unworthy, and has bowed to the current onslaught of political correctness and historical revisionism,” he said. Nike, whose shares ended down marginally at $84.96, released a statement explaining its decision to yank the product. “We regularly make business decisions to withdraw initiatives, products and services,” the company said. “NIKE made the decision to halt distribution of the Air Max 1 Quick Strike Fourth of July based on concerns that it could unintentionally offend and detract from the nation’s patriotic holiday.” The Beaverton, Oregon-based company is one of a slew of retailers that have faced major backlash over products that draw criticism for being racially insensitive. In December, Prada pulled products accused of depicting blackface. On Monday, reality TV star and businesswoman Kim Kardashian said she would rename her Kimono shapewear line after people in Japan said her use of the term was disrespectful. Ducey, who was joined by many conservatives including Republican Senator Ted Cruz in expressing his disappointment toward Nike, said he had ordered the state’s commerce authority to withdraw all financial incentives under its discretion for the company’s plant. Nike was eligible for up to a $1 million grant, a spokeswoman at the Arizona Commerce Authority said, for a $185 million plant in Goodyear, Arizona, that would employ over 500 people. Kaepernick last year became the face of Nike’s advertisement marking the 30th anniversary of the company’s “Just Do It” slogan. The ad revived a raging debate in the United States that started in 2016 when Kaepernick, then with the San Francisco 49ers, began kneeling to protest multiple police shootings of unarmed black men. Since then, the company’s stock has risen about 4% as of Monday’s close. This year, Nike’s shares are up 15%. One industry expert recalled Nike experiencing “one of its best quarters” after the Kaepernick campaign launch and said the chances of this sneaker controversy hurting company sales, which total roughly $39 billion annually, were “largely nil.” “I think it’s important to understand who Nike’s core demographic is here,” said Matt Powell, senior industry adviser at NPD. “They’re really focused on teens and looking at the commentary on Twitter and so forth. I don’t see a lot of teens coming out with a negative attitude here.”"

The soccer jersey sells for $90 on the Nike website. The Americans will play against England in a semifinal match on Tuesday in Lyon. Parker said that two-thirds of the teams at the start of the tournament wore Nike kits.

A unanimous three-judge panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said Nike could no longer argue that the amount of time workers spent in security screenings was “de minimis” and not compensable under California law, in light of the California Supreme Court’s 2018 decision in Troester v.

American middle distance runner Alysia Montano and British distance runner Jo Pavey both said earlier this month that Nike had stopped their sponsorship payments while pregnant. Sponsorship agreements with athletes typically include clauses that reduce payments if they do not reach performance-based targets. The company told Reuters on May 16 it still had performance-based payment reduction clauses in their agreements, but they had changed their policy last year so that no female athletes would be “penalized financially for pregnancy”. The New York Times added on Friday that Nike would waive performance-pay reductions for 12 months for athletes who have a baby and said they could do more. “We’ve recognized Nike, Inc., can do more, and there is an important opportunity for the sports industry collectively to evolve to better support female athletes,” Sandra Carreon-John, a Nike spokeswoman, said in a emailed statement to the newspaper."
-2.3912030710298393," Trump antagonist Avenatti indicted for ripping off Stormy Daniels, extorting Nike NEW YORK (Reuters) - Michael Avenatti’s legal troubles escalated on Wednesday as federal prosecutors announced new indictments accusing the lawyer and prominent critic of U.S. President Donald Trump of ripping off porn star Stormy Daniels and extorting Nike Inc. Prosecutors in Manhattan accused Avenatti, 48, of stealing about $300,000 from Daniels, the client who made him famous, to fund an extravagant lifestyle including a Ferrari automobile, after helping her secure a book contract. The Nike indictment concerns charges announced in March that Avenatti tried to extort more than $20 million from the athletic wear company by threatening to expose what he called its improper payments to recruits for college basketball teams it sponsored. Avenatti also faces dozens of charges in southern California, where prosecutors on April 11 accused him of stealing millions of dollars from clients to pay for personal and business expenses, and lying to the Internal Revenue Service and a Mississippi bank about his finances. If convicted on all charges, Avenatti could face more than 400 years in prison, but would likely face a lesser punishment. Nike has denied wrongdoing, and assisted prosecutors prior to Avenatti’s arrest. Avenatti has maintained his innocence and said the earlier prosecutions were to punish him for representing Daniels and criticizing Trump. Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, received hush money to keep quiet about an affair she claimed to have had with Trump in 2006. The president has denied having had sex with Daniels. “I look forward to a jury hearing all of the evidence and passing judgment on my conduct,” Avenatti wrote on Twitter after the indictments were announced. “At no time was any money misappropriated or mishandled. I will be fully exonerated once the relevant emails, contracts, text messages, and documents are presented.” He later said in an email that Daniels had received “millions of dollars worth of legal services.” Lawyers for Avenatti did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Daniels could not immediately be reached. Avenatti represented Daniels in lawsuits arising from a $130,000 hush money payment from former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen shortly before the 2016 presidential election. Prosecutors said Avenatti diverted two $148,750 installment payments from Daniels’ $800,000 book advance, after sending her literary agent a letter that forged her signature, and directed that money be sent to his bank account. Daniels is identified in court papers as “Victim-1.” A person familiar with the matter who was not authorized to speak publicly confirmed her identity. According to the papers, Avenatti spent some of the diverted funds on lease payments for the Ferrari, hotels, airfare, restaurant meals, car service and business expenses. Prosecutors said Avenatti eventually paid $148,750 to Daniels after obtaining the money from another source, but lied when she asked where the second payment was by telling her the publisher “owes me a payment” and that he was “on it.” Daniels has not received that payment, prosecutors said. She dropped Avenatti as her lawyer earlier this year. “Michael Avenatti abused and violated the core duty of an attorney--the duty to his client,” U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman, who announced Wednesday’s indictments, said in a statement. “Far from zealously representing his client, Avenatti, as alleged, instead engaged in outright deception and theft, victimizing rather than advocating for his client,” Berman added. The charges related to Daniels include one count of wire fraud and one count of aggravated identity theft, and carry a maximum combined penalty of 22 years in prison. Daniels’ book “Full Disclosure” was published in October. Cohen is two weeks into his three-year prison term after pleading guilty to campaign finance violations, including the hush money payment. Avenatti became a familiar face on cable news channels as his stature grew, and flirted last year with a 2020 White House run. He has had a lower profile since being charged."

Prosecutors said Avenatti spent some diverted money on monthly lease payments for a Ferrari, hotels, airfare, restaurant meals, car service and business expenses. When Daniels asked why she had not received a $148,750 installment payment, Avenatti lied by telling her he had yet to receive it from the publisher, according to court papers.

""The proposed additional tariff of 25 percent on footwear would be catastrophic for our consumers, our companies, and the American economy as a whole,"" a group of 173 companies said in a letter here. Trump increased tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports to 25% from 10% earlier this month, a move that is expected to raise prices on thousands of products including clothing, furniture and electronics Trump is expected to impose 25% tariffs on another $300 billion worth of Chinese goods when he meets Chinese President Xi Jinping next month. “As an industry that faces a $3 billion duty bill every year, we can assure you that any increase in the cost of importing shoes has a direct impact on the American footwear consumer,” the companies said. The letter was also sent to Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer and National Economic Council director Larry Kudlow. The Footwear Distributors & Retailers of America (FDRA) estimates the hike in tariff would add $7 billion in additional costs for customers every year. The companies noted that the tariffs on footwear average 11.3% and reach rates as high as 67.5%. Adding a 25% tax increase on top of these tariffs would mean Americans could pay a nearly 100% duty on their shoes, the companies said in the letter. Last week, the world’s largest retailer Walmart Inc warned that its prices would increase due to higher tariffs on goods from China and that the levies were already hurting its furniture business. Macy’s also said that the tariffs enacted on May 10, does have some impact, particularly on its furniture business."

-4.808496704349884," British runner Pavey says Nike froze sponsorship when pregnant (Reuters) - British distance runner Jo Pavey has become the latest female athlete to complain that Nike halted her sponsorship payments when she was pregnant, Sky News reported on Thursday. The five-time Olympian said the athletic apparel company froze her payments when she revealed that she was expecting her first child Jacob, who was born in 2009. “When I announced I was pregnant my contract was immediately paused,” Pavey, who won 10,000 meters bronze at the 2007 world championships, told Sky. “One of the main problems is the target to get the contract back and the timescale,” she said. “It was the joy of running that kept me going because you think, ‘What will be will be’ and I was focused on being a mum. But you don’t want to feel punished for being pregnant.” Pavey’s comments come after American middle distance runner Alysia Montano made similar claims in a video on the New York Times website earlier this week. “I was sponsored by Nike and when I told them I wanted to have a baby during my career, they said, ‘Simple, we’ll just pause your contract and stop paying you,’” said Montano, who famously competed while eight months’ pregnant in 2014. “How about when you tell my daughter she can achieve anything, you back it up?” Nike frequently promotes gender and racial equality in its advertising campaigns. In a statement to Reuters, Nike said it had changed its policy last year on sponsorship so that no female athletes would be “penalized financially for pregnancy.” “Nike is proud to sponsor thousands of female athletes,” a Nike spokesman said in an emailed statement. “As is common practice in our industry, our agreements do include performance-based payment reductions. Historically, a few female athletes had performance based reductions applied.”"
-5.057335567903003," Adidas shares hit record as ecommerce boosts profits BERLIN (Reuters) - Adidas reported a forecast-beating rise in quarterly profits on Friday, helped by booming online sales, and said it hoped to fix supply chain problems in the North American market and revive growth in Europe by the end of the year. Shares in the German sportswear maker, which have risen by a quarter this year, jumped 7 percent to a new record high, with the sector also buoyed by Under Armour Inc raising its full-year earnings forecast on Thursday. The group’s profitability has long lagged that of bigger rival Nike, but has improved under Chief Executive Kasper Rorsted, who has focused on expanding in North America and Asia and pushing online sales, where margins are higher than wholesale. In the first quarter, Adidas said its operating margin rose 1.4 percentage points to 14.9 percent, pulling ahead of Nike which recorded an operating margin of 13.5 percent for the December to February period. “Earnings are much better than guided for the full year – leaving the door open for margin guidance upgrades in the course of the year 2019,” said Baader Helvea analyst Volker Bosse, who rates the stock “hold”. Adidas is chipping away at Nike’s dominance of the U.S. market, pushing retro styles that have proved more popular than Nike’s basketball shoes, and teaming up with celebrities such as Kanye West, whose Yeezy line has driven recent strong growth. Adidas announced last month it is partnering with singer Beyonce, which Rorsted said on Friday would have a “tremendous impact”, noting that the deal generated 1 billion online views, with the first products due for launch later in 2019. First-quarter profitability was helped by lower sourcing and marketing costs, favorable currency developments as well as selling more higher priced products and the expansion of online, with ecommerce sales up 40 percent in the quarter. Rorsted told journalists ecommerce had grown fast in all regions, helped by exclusive launches of new products and the fact the Adidas app has been downloaded 9 million times. He expects online growth to continue at 30-40 percent for years. Overall, sales growth slowed in the first quarter to a currency-adjusted 4 percent rise to 5.883 billion euros ($6.57 billion), but was still ahead of analyst consensus. Adidas had already warned in March that supply chain issues would hit sales growth in the first half, citing particular problems meeting North America demand for mid-market clothing. Adidas said it was working to mitigate the shortages, including using more air freight to ship goods - implying higher logistics costs in the second and third quarters - but Rorsted said the problems should ease by the end of the year. He also expects a recovery by then in Europe - where revenue fell 3 percent in the first quarter, as Adidas seeks to reduce its reliance on its Originals fashion line and boost sales of sports performance gear, with new product launches. Sales of soccer jerseys ahead of the 2020 European soccer championship should have their first positive impact in the fourth quarter, Rorsted added."

0.17095527415506218," Lululemon soars on menswear, online push; inches into Nike turf (Reuters) - Shares of yoga-pants specialists Lululemon Athletica Inc rose 15 percent on Thursday, with several Wall Street analysts raising their price targets for the company after a blockbuster fourth quarter. Wednesday’s results showed the Vancouver-based athleisure wear maker moving strongly into menswear, improving online sales and potentially challenging bigger rival Nike Inc on its home turf. Lululemon forecast a strong 2019, said North America was doing well and reported a 37 percent jump in direct-to-consumer net revenue for the three months ended Feb. 3. The company is reaping the benefits from heavy investments in boosting its online presence, opening more stores and refreshing its clothing line. Online sales in China were particularly robust, rising more than 140 percent in the quarter, Chief Operating Officer Stuart Haselden said on a post-earnings conference call. “Lulu captured the women’s market, that’s where they started with yogawear being their staple. Now they’ve evolved some of that collection into everyday-wear and that’s been really successful for them,” Jane Hali & Associates analyst Jessica Ramirez said. Design oriented and fashion forward apparel also allow Lululemon to charge premium prices, Ramirez said. Its success in North America, which contributes close to 90 percent of its business, stood out in a quarter where Nike, which introduced yogawear at the end of last year, fell short of Wall Street estimates for U.S. sales the first time in a year. “There’s a lot of runway for us to continue to grow our men’s business,” Chief Operating Officer Stuart Haselden said in a post earnings conference call with analysts. “We really believe that Lululemon can be a dual-gender brand, and that our men’s business can ultimately be as big as our women’s.” Allen Adamson, co-founder of marketing consultancy firm Metaforce, said that Lululemon’s expansion into menswear and fitness will add to headaches for Nike and Adidas, already in a brutal war over market share in their core markets. “They play in the same neighborhood but not on the same block,” he said. “Lululemon has one foot in the fashion world and one foot in athletics while Nike has both feet in athletics.” Adamson said Lululemon could pose more of a threat to Nike in newer markets like China where consumers’ definitions of the circumstances in which they can wear fitness, athletics and sports clothing are shifting quickly. At least 11 brokerages have raised their price targets on Lululemon’s stock, with Stifel raising it the most by $35 to $187. JP Morgan held the highest target price of $197. “We expect Lululemon to continue to rise above others who sell active wear, through targeted and nuanced customer engagement both online and in stores,” Susquehanna analyst Sam Poser said. Shares of the company were up 15 percent at $168.60 in mid-day trade."
0.6315714015310266," Nike fined $14 million for blocking cross-border sales of soccer merchandise BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. sportswear maker Nike was hit with a 12.5 million euro ($14.14 million) fine on Monday for blocking cross-border sales of soccer merchandise of some of Europe’s best-known clubs, the latest EU sanction against such restrictions. The European Commission said Nike’s illegal practices occurred between 2004 to 2017 and related to licensed merchandise for FC Barcelona, Manchester United, Juventus, Inter Milan, AS Roma and the French Football Federation. The European Union case focused on Nike’s role as a licensor for making and distributing licensed merchandise featuring a soccer club’s brands and not its own trademarks. The sanction came after a two-year investigation triggered by a sector inquiry into e-commerce in the 28-country bloc. The EU wants to boost online trade and economic growth. European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said Nike’s actions deprived soccer fans in other countries of the opportunity to buy their clubs’ merchandise such as mugs, bags, bed sheets, stationery and toys. “Nike prevented many of its licensees from selling these branded products in a different country leading to less choice and higher prices for consumers,” she said in a statement. Nike’s practices included clauses in contracts prohibiting out-of-territory sales by licensees and threats to end agreements if licensees ignored the clauses. Its fine was cut by 40 percent after it cooperated with the EU enforcer. ($1 = 0.8839 euros)"

4.621801600849134," Nike shares dip on North America weakness but Wall Street remains upbeat (Reuters) - Shares of Nike Inc fell 4 percent on Friday after the sportswear maker’s North America sales fell short of estimates for the first time in a year, but Wall Street analysts seemed more enthused about its new products and online growth. The company faced intense pressure from European rivals Adidas and Puma a year ago, but has managed to win back market share with new launches of its popular Air Max and Jordan sneakers, increased focus on women’s wear and higher investment in online business. “The athletic footwear cycle and brand power are solid. Nike’s business is strengthening in North America, and we expect the company to continue to recapture the share it has lost to Adidas,” said Jefferies analyst, adding that the stock might be slightly down given “high expectations”. The company on Thursday blamed delay in new launches for a slowdown in apparel sales in North America during the quarter, which was marked by an outcry on social media after a Nike sneaker worn by Duke University basketball star Zion Williamson ripped open during a high-profile game. Still, the stock continues to be one of Wall Street’s favorites. Out of 34 brokerages covering the stock, 25 analysts rate it ‘buy’ or higher and only one analyst has a sell rating on the stock. Nike’s shares trade at 28.6 times the company’s 12-month forward earnings, compared with rival Adidas’ 21.5 times and Under Armour’s 59.5 times, according to Refinitiv IBES data. Just two brokerages - Credit Suisse and UBS - lowered their target on the stock. Credit Suisse cut its price by $3 to $97, still well above the median price target of $92.5. Nike’s online business, which includes sales from the SNKRS and Nike apps, was the main profit driver in the reported quarter. Revenue from that business rose 36 percent in the quarter. While most analysts were enthusiastic about the results, some said higher expenses as the only dark spot in an otherwise strong report. Jefferies analyst Randal Konik flagged a rise in selling, general and administrative expenses due to wage-related expenses."

Shares of the world’s largest sportswear maker have gained nearly 19 percent this year, as investors cheered its “Consumer Direct Offense” strategy that includes a focus on online sales, new launches and supply chain improvements to bring fresh products to shelves faster. The company has launched timed, limited-edition sales on its app, often in collaboration with celebrities and athletes, called “drops,” generating hype around its brands, especially with its Jordan line of basketball shoes. Nike has also introduced sneakers such as the Air Max 720 and Epic React Flyknit 2 to capture market share in the United States. The efforts, however, fell short of analysts’ elevated expectations. North America sales rose 7 percent to $3.81 billion in the third quarter, falling short of estimates of $3.87 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. “While it’s not very clear what caused the domestic weakness, it’s possible that the news of what happened with the Duke University player’s shoe had a short-term negative impact,” said Kian Salehizadeh, a senior analyst at investment firm Blockforce Capital. College basketball superstar Zion Williamson sprained his knee in February after his Nike sneaker split during a game, prompting an outcry on social media. Salehizadeh, whose firm owns shares in Nike through ETFs, said overall retail weakness in the United States over the last few months could also have hit sales. Nike Chief Financial Officer Andrew Campion highlighted timing of launches of some NBA apparel products last year on a post-earnings call. A decline at the Converse brand also weighed. “Converse is losing out to brands like Vans, while Nike seems to be focusing more on the growth of its Jordan business,” Jane Hali & Associates analyst Jessica Ramirez told Reuters. Nike said it expects low single-digit reported revenue growth in the current quarter, compared to analysts’ estimates of a 6.1 percent rise. This comes as analysts have said Nike is likely to gain after German rival Adidas warned that supply chain issues would curb sales growth in the first half of the year, particularly in North America. Nike’s total revenue increased 7 percent to $9.61 billion, in line with analysts’ average estimate. The maker of Air Force 1 sneakers reported net income of $1.1 billion, or 68 cents per share, for the third quarter ended Feb. 28, beating estimates of 65 cents."

-2.4290400750169265," Supply chain problems to slow Adidas' sales growth HERZOGENAURACH, Germany (Reuters) - Adidas expects supply chain issues to curb sales growth in the first half of the year, particularly in North America, where it has doubled its business in the last three years to take market share from bigger rival Nike. Adidas has put a big focus on the U.S. market in recent years, teaming up with celebrities such as Kanye West and Pharrell Williams, poaching designers from Nike and pushing retro styles that have proved more popular than Nike’s basketball shoes. But Chief Executive Kasper Rorsted said on Wednesday its suppliers - mostly in Asia - have not been able to keep up, especially as the company has expanded from high-end products into more mid-priced clothing ranges in the U.S. market. “The volume grew quicker than anticipated and we didn’t respond quickly enough to that demand signal,” Rorsted told a news conference as Adidas presented 2018 results. Those supply issues will knock 200 to 400 million euros, or 1-2 percentage points, off currency-neutral group sales growth in 2019, which is likely to slow to between 5 and 8 percent in 2019 from 8 percent in 2018. In contrast, Nike has forecast sales growth for 2019 approaching low double digits as it rolls out a steady stream of popular new products, and German rival Puma a currency-adjusted 10 percent. Shares in the German sportswear brand, up 22 percent in the last year, initially fell more than 5 percent but pared loses to trade down 2.2 percent by 1512 GMT. Adidas produces 457 million pieces of apparel a year, sourcing most of them from Cambodia, China and Vietnam. Rorsted said the shortages had nothing to do with U.S. trade tensions with China. The company expects sales growth of just 3-4 percent in the first half of the year, speeding up in the second half as it ramps up supplies by reallocating factory capacity and prioritizing the U.S. market. Rorsted removed Gil Steyaert as head of the Adidas global supply chain last month after just over a year in the role, and replaced him with Martin Shankland. “The overall outlook is very solid for 2019, although top line growth will be rather back-end-loaded and this might be a temporary drag on Adidas shares,” wrote Macquarie analysts. Currency-neutral sales rose 9 percent in North America in October to December to account for about a quarter of the total, helped by the launch of new “Yeezy” shoes designed by Kanye West. Until recently, Adidas has only produced small quantities of Yeezy sneakers, but it is now increasing production and Rorsted said it expects to launch about 20-30 Yeezy products a year, with the partnership becoming more commercially relevant. Adidas said it should reach an operating profit margin of between 11.3 percent and 11.5 percent in 2019, up from 10.8 percent in 2018, with the return of the Reebok brand to profit helping it hit a target originally set for 2020 a year early. Fourth-quarter sales rose by a currency-adjusted 5 percent to 5.234 billion euros ($5.91 billion), ahead of average analyst forecasts for 5.2 billion, while attributable net profit came in at 108 million, versus consensus for 88 million. Sales rose 13 percent in greater China, but fell 6 percent in Europe, where Nike has been growing fast. Adidas said it expected to revive growth in Europe in the course of 2019, forecasting a slight increase in currency-neutral revenues for the region. Rorsted said that Adidas had relied too much in Europe on a short-term trend for fashion shoes, like its retro Stan Smith and Superstar, with global sales of those models down half a billion euros in 2018 from the previous year. To recover in Europe, he said Adidas is investing heavily in marketing, including with sponsorship deals like the one it struck with English soccer side Arsenal. “We want to be the best sports company in the world, not the best fashion company,” Rorsted said."

The United States, Canada, France, England and Australia were among the teams whose kits were released at an event in Paris, graced by 28 of the world’s top women footballers. Olympic gymnast Simone Biles, champion fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad and two-time Grand Slam winner Li Na also attended. The Women’s World Cup will be held from June 7 to July 7. “We’re seeing incredible momentum in women’s sports right now,” Nike official Amy Montagne told Reuters ahead of the launch. “We see this as the next chapter to support, celebrate and elevate female athletes.” The company declined to give financial terms of the deal with European governing body UEFA, or the value of the individual national kit sponsorship deals. Both, however, are the latest sign of the growing financial power of women’s sport for sports goods makers like Nike, Adidas and Under Armour. In the second quarter of the 2019 financial year, women’s footwear and apparel alone counted for nearly a quarter of Nike’s total revenue and it has said the women’s footwear and apparel market is now 1.5 times bigger than that for men. Wall Street brokerage Bernstein calculates women’s sporting gear pulled in $7 billion for Nike last year. As a part of the partnership with UEFA, Nike will supply the match ball for exclusive use in women’s competitions including the Women’s Champions League, Women’s Euro and junior tournaments. Nadine Kessler, UEFA’s head of women’s football said the partnership across competitions and campaigns sends “a powerful message that the game is now being judged and supported on its own merits, it underlines also its important milestones beyond the field of play.” Nike’s announcement of a partnership with UEFA comes three months after Visa signed a seven-year deal with European soccer’s governing body to sponsor the women’s game at all levels. It also comes at a time when UEFA plans to increase its funding for women’s soccer development projects across Europe by 50 percent from 2020. Global governing body FIFA, which has made women’s football a top priority, last year said it would look to double the number of female players to 60 million by 2026. It also said it would raise the prize money for this year’s World Cup from $15 million to $30 million. Nike said it would also invest at the grassroots level to encourage more female athletes. “We believe this summer can be another turning point for the growth of women’s football,” Nike’s chief executive Mark Parker said in a statement."

-1.587955813768423," Nike stumbles into social media storm after basketball star's shoe splits NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Nike Inc sneaker worn by a college basketball superstar split in half less than a minute into a highly anticipated game between Duke University and North Carolina, prompting an outcry on social media as the company sought to figure out what caused the problem. Zion Williamson, a 6-foot-7-inch freshman forward for the Duke Blue Devils who is anticipated to be the top 2019 NBA Draft pick, suffered a mild sprain to his right knee because of the incident on Wednesday night, according to his coach Mike Krzyzewski. The official Duke Basketball Twitter handle (@DukeMBB) tweeted Thursday evening that Zion was “progressing as expected, and his status is day-to-day.” A closeup video replay showed Williamson slipping and crumpling to the ground, clutching his knee in pain. His left shoe is seen split in half, with part of the sole ripped off the base of the sneaker. Williamson did not return to play in the match-up, which ended with No. 1-ranked Duke losing 72-88 to the No. 8-ranked Tar Heels team. “We are obviously concerned and want to wish Zion a speedy recovery,” Nike said in a statement. “The quality and performance of our products are of utmost importance. While this is an isolated occurrence, we are working to identify the issue.” Shares of the sportswear maker closed down 1 percent on Thursday, a day after the incident, wiping off some $1.46 billion from Nike’s market capitalization since Wednesday’s close. Oppenheimer analyst Brian Nagel said in a note that he was optimistic “any lasting damage to the company and its shares will prove minimal.” Williamson was wearing the Nike PG 2.5 basketball shoe when he was injured, Nike confirmed to Reuters in an email. The line of sneakers, launched in summer of 2018, sells for $95-$105 on Nike’s website. The shoe received mixed reviews and a rating of 4 out of 5 stars on Nike.com as of Thursday. Nike is Duke’s exclusive supplier of uniforms, shoes and apparel under a 12-year contract that was extended in 2015 and has had an exclusive deal with the private university since 1992, ESPN reported. Nike’s latest quarterly results showed signs of a rebound as it speeds up new product launches and expands partnerships with online retailers. The Beaverton, Oregon-based company has forecast sales growth for 2019 approaching low double-digits. Williamson, who averaged 21.6 points a game, has been tipped as the “next Lebron James” and is expected to be selected first in the NBA Draft this June. Krzyzewski said it was unclear how long Williamson would be out because of the injury. Former President Barack Obama, director Spike Lee and star NFL running back Todd Gurley attended Wednesday’s game at Cameron Indoor Stadium, the home court of the Blue Devils. A video from the match posted on Twitter showed Obama sitting courtside, expressing shock and mouthing the words, “his shoe broke!” The incident lit up social media, with celebrities and some of basketball’s biggest stars expressing shock and dismay. “Hope young fella is ok!” tweeted LeBron James (@KingJames) on Wednesday. “Literally blew thru his [shoe],” he added, using a shoe emoji. “Again let’s remember all the money that went into this game.... and these players get none of it,” Donovan Mitchell (@spidadmitchell), a former first-round NBA draft pick and current guard for the Utah Jazz, tweeted on Wednesday. “And now Zion gets hurt... something has to change.” Nike’s social media sentiment dropped following the malfunction, according to social media analytics firm Zoomph. With 1.6 billion impressions and a reach of 170 million users, people were twice as likely to express negative sentiment about the athletic apparel maker, Zoomph data showed. This is not the first time Nike has faced controversy over the craftsmanship of its sportswear. In 2017, the company faced a backlash when several NBA jerseys worn by basketball stars, including James, ripped apart."
11.35615570002538," Nike's Dutch tax status investigated by EU regulators BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission has opened an investigation into the tax treatment of Nike Inc NKE.N in the Netherlands, saying this may have given the U.S. sportswear maker an illegal advantage. The Nike case, announced on Thursday, follows other probes by the EU executive since 2013 into tax schemes in Belgium, Gibraltar, Luxembourg, Ireland and the Netherlands it says allow companies to establish structures to reduce their taxes unfairly. The countries have been ordered to recover the tax from beneficiaries of such schemes, which have included Amazon AMZN.O, Apple AAPL.O, Starbucks SBOX.O and Fiat FCHA.MI. The Commission said in a statement that Dutch authorities had issued five tax rulings from 2006 to 2015, two of which are still in force, endorsing a method to calculate the royalty payments to two Nike entities based in the Netherlands. The EU executive, which oversees competition policy in the 28-member European Union, said that, at this stage, it was concerned that the royalty payments endorsed by the rulings “may not reflect economic reality”. “Member states should not allow companies to set up complex structures that unduly reduce their taxable profits and give them an unfair advantage over competitors,” EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said in a statement. Nike said it was subject to and ensured that it complied with all the same tax laws as other companies operating in the Netherlands. “We believe the European Commission’s investigation is without merit,” a Nike spokesperson said. The Dutch finance ministry said it would cooperate with the Commission’s investigation and said that it agreed tax rulings should provide certainty and not preferential treatment. The Commission has pushed governments to tighten taxation rules in response to revelations in the so-called LuxLeaks and the Panama and Paradise Papers, but some countries have resisted EU-wide changes. Vestager did say she welcomed actions taken by the Netherlands to reform its corporate taxation rules and to help to ensure that companies operate on a level playing field. The Commission said its new investigation concerned the tax treatment of two Nike companies based in the Netherlands - Nike European Operations Netherlands BV and Converse Netherlands BV - which market and record sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. They received licenses to use intellectual property rights of Nike and Converse products in the region in return for tax-deductible royalty payments to two other Nike entities also based in the Netherlands, but not taxable there. The Commission said the royalty payments appeared higher than what independent companies would have agreed between themselves. As a result the Netherlands may have allowed the Nike companies to pay a lower amount of tax. If this was confirmed, it would amount to illegal state aid. The Commission will allow the Netherlands and interested parties to submit comments. The Commission is also conducting an in-depth investigation into Dutch tax rulings in favor of IKEA and an investigation into a tax scheme for multinationals in Britain."

The company’s double-digit percentage growth in China was in addition to strong demand in North America, Nike’s biggest and most competitive market, where sales got a boost from higher full-priced sales and a rebound in Jordan sneakers. In a note titled “A perfect quarter in an imperfect world,” Jefferies analyst said that Nike’s results this quarter were perfect amidst global trade disruption cited by FedEx. Earlier this week, FedEx Corp FDX.N stunned markets with a drastic cut in its full-year profit forecast, citing global trade worries. On a post earnings call with analysts on Thursday, Nike’s Chief Financial Officer Andy Campion said that the company had not seen any impact from the ongoing trade friction. “Clear indications of better sales in the U.S. and elsewhere, including China, should help to comfort investors increasingly worried about the potential for macro slowdown,” Oppenheimer analyst Brian Nagel said.

Third-quarter economic growth was revised lower, but the pace was likely strong enough to keep growth on track to hit the Trump administration’s 3 percent target this year. Growth estimates for the fourth quarter are expected to be 2.9 percent, indicating a slowdown amid a widening trade deficit, sluggish business spending on equipment and a weak housing market. This follows the Federal Reserve’s plan to keep raising interest rates on Wednesday, which was an added headache for investors already fearful that trade wars and other geopolitical concerns would grind economic and corporate growth to a halt. Now all eyes will be on the November consumer spending, which is expected to have slowed from the month before. But the data, due at 10 a.m. ET, is also expected to show that the core PCE index, the Fed’s preferred inflation measure, edged higher. Sentiment was weak earlier as investors also fretted over political turmoil in Washington. There is a chance that the government could be shut down unless President Donald Trump and Congress cut a funding deal, while adding to the air of crisis was the abrupt resignation of U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis after falling out with Trump over his foreign policies. Volatility may rise again on Friday on account of “quadruple witching”, as investors unwind interests in futures and options contracts prior to expiration. “Fears of a government shutdown, Mattis resigning, all those things I think are weighing on the sentiment. The attitude was already pretty bad and they (news from Washington) are certainly not helping,” said Scott Brown, chief economist at Raymond James in St. Petersburg, Florida. One silver lining was Nike Inc, whose shares jumped 9.1 percent in premarket trading after the company’s quarterly results beat Wall Street estimates on strength in North America. At 9:07 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 18 points, or 0.08 percent. S&P 500 e-minis were up 0.75 points, or 0.03 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 10.75 points, or 0.17 percent. The three main Wall Street indexes are already in correction territory, having fallen more than 10 percent from their record closing highs, and are closing in on bear market territory, when a security closes 20 percent below a recent high. While the Nasdaq came within a whisker of bear market territory on Thursday, other segments of the market, including the Russell 2000 small-cap benchmark and the Dow Jones Transport Average are already in bear market territory."

21.92405415689102," North America, online sales power Nike's quarterly results beat (Reuters) - Nike Inc's NKE.N quarterly results beat Wall Street estimates, boosted by strength in North America where new launches led to higher sale of more full-priced footwear and apparel online, sending its shares up 7 percent on Thursday. For more than a year, Nike has been speeding up the pace of new product launches and expanding partnerships with online retailers, which helped drive a more than 30 percent rise in digital sales in its home market. Overall online sales rose 41 percent in the quarter. A ramp up in its supply chain to bring fresh fashion faster to stores also helped the world's largest sportswear maker take more market share from German rival Adidas AG ADSGn.DE in North America. In November, Nike opened doors to a new flagship store in New York’s Fifth Avenue, a six-storey building where customers can choose sizes and pay for products just using the Nike app. The company is also working toward launching cheaper versions of its auto-lacing sneakers, inspired from the movie “Back to the Future”. Analyst Daniel Martin at D.M. Martins Research said the company’s better supply chain management has helped it overcome higher product costs. In the reported quarter, cost of sales rose 8 percent. In North America, its biggest market, Nike’s new strategies led to an 8.5 percent rise in revenue in the second quarter. “It’s clear that the consumers are craving experiences and the fastest way to meet that demand is to test, learn and scale new features,” Nike’s Chief Executive Officer Mark Parker said on a post-earnings call with analysts. Even in China, where investors were worried about its growth due to the ongoing tariff war with the United States, revenue expanded 26.4 percent in the quarter. For 2019, Nike said excluding fluctuations in exchange rates, it expects stronger revenue growth than previously planned.

16.345409582504512," Foot Locker shares soar after Air Max boost (Reuters) - Foot Locker FL.N shares jumped 20 percent on Wednesday after third-quarter results showed shoe sales turning back to growth thanks to a boost from Nike's latest lines, heading off fears it was losing out to Amazon AMZN.O and other online stores. The retailer’s same-store sales from footwear climbed in the three months ended Nov. 3 after falling for six consecutive quarters, Foot Locker said, as U.S. shoppers bought Nike’s new Air Max shoes. Analysts have feared that Nike's NKE.N move about two years ago to begin selling via Amazon and its own stores would hurt Foot Locker and other third-party sellers which rely on relationships with manufacturers to pull shoppers. But Tuesday’s results suggested that Foot Locker’s tie-up with Nike was intact, and even growing, leading at least seven Wall Street analysts to raise their 12-month targets on the New York-based retailer’s stock price. “Foot Locker’s position continues to improve and it remains a top destination for Sneakerheads and a strong partner for multiple brands, including Nike,” Wedbush Securities analyst Christopher Svezia said in a report. Its ability to continue collaborating with Nike to launch products exclusively for its core shoppers is keeping sales humming, said Cristina Fernández at Telsey Advisory Group. The two companies have tied up to improve the customer experience in stores by hiring trained associates to inform shoppers about exclusive sneaker launches by Nike. In Los Angeles Foot Locker launched a Jumpman store with an investment from Nike’s Jordan brand to house curated Jordan collections. “I get excited about launches, but I get more excited about the collaborations that we’ve got with our great vendor partners,” Richard Johnson, Foot Locker’s chief executive officer, said on Tuesday’s conference call with analysts. Nike’s own resurgent shoe sales, especially of Air Max shoes, is benefiting Foot Locker, Jefferies analyst Janine Stichter said. “While we don’t see the bear case around (Nike’s) push toward a Consumer Direct strategy going away just yet, we do think that (Foot Locker’s) commentary around the strength of their relationship with Nike should help to quell some fears,” she said. Stichter raised her price target on Foot Locker shares by $2 to $62. The stock was last up 15 percent at $53 in premarket trading. If the gains hold, Foot Locker shares are on track for a five-month high, setting them on course to finish higher in 2018."

5.982515339843606," Adidas slips in Europe as Stan Smiths, Superstars go out of fashion BERLIN (Reuters) - Adidas ADSGn.DE cut its 2018 revenue forecast on Wednesday after third quarter sales fell in western Europe, where it was hit by changing fashions and Nike's NKE.N gains in soccer. While the German sportswear firm has been taking market share in North America, its U.S. rival has been powering ahead in Europe, helped by a strong showing by Nike-sponsored teams at the soccer World Cup and its Phantom range launch. Adidas shares, which have gained 12 percent in the last year, were down 2.3 percent by 0954 GMT after it cut its 2018 target for currency-neutral sales growth to between 8 to 9 percent from “around 10 percent”. Chief Executive Kasper Rorsted has focused on improving profitability at Adidas since he took over in 2016, by focusing on growing in North America and Asia and pushing ecommerce, where margins are higher than in stores. Adidas said it now expects 2018 net income from continuing operations to grow 16 to 20 percent, compared with previous guidance of 13 to 17 percent. After an earlier warning that western European sale were likely to be flat in the second half, Adidas said the region’s currency-adjusted sales fell 1 percent in the third quarter. Rorsted said Adidas had relied too much on shoes like its retro Stan Smith and Superstar that have fallen out of fashion, and not enough on sports performance gear. “We are a sports company. We should have done a better job in the sports channel,” he told journalists. Adidas had also failed to react quickly enough to demand for its new styles like Continental shoes, and had overpriced some goods, all factors it is now addressing, Rorsted added. Adidas continued to grow fast elsewhere, with sales up 16 percent in North America and by 15 percent in Asia-Pacific. Ecommerce sales jumped 76 percent in the quarter and Adidas saw the September launch of Yeezy Boost shoes designed by rapper Kanye West drive traffic to its website, with sales and margins of the new styles above its expectations. Overall, Adidas said its third-quarter sales rose by a currency-adjusted 8 percent to 5.873 billion euros ($6.75 billion), shy of analysts’ average forecasts, while net profit from continuing operations jumped 19 percent to 656 million euros, beating consensus. German rival Puma PUMG.DE raised its outlook for full-year sales and operating profit last month as it reported strong sales growth in the Americas and Asia and said its first basketball shoe in 20 years had been well received.

3.7720550202200998," USA Gymnastics interim CEO quits after anti-Nike tweet (Reuters) - Mary Bono resigned as interim chief of USA Gymnastics on Tuesday, only four days into the job, after she drew fire for a tweet she sent criticizing Nike Inc's NKE.N use of former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick in an ad campaign. Bono’s Oct. 12 appointment was criticized by leading gymnasts such as Simone Biles who questioned whether the former Republican congresswoman was fit to lead the organization as it tries to recover from a sexual abuse scandal. In a statement, USA Gymnastics said it had accepted Bono’s resignation, which was in “the best interest of the organization.” In a letter posted on Twitter, Bono said she stepped down after “personal attacks” and defended her First Amendment right to tweet a photo of her marking over the Nike logo on her golf shoes at a benefit tournament for armed service families. Olympic-gold medalist gymnast Biles spoke out against the photo, which Bono said was her own criticism of Nike advertisements featuring Kaepernick, who sparked a national controversy by kneeling during the national anthem. “*mouth drop*,” wrote Nike-sponsored Biles on Twitter on Saturday. “don’t worry, it’s not like we needed a smarter usa gymnastics president or any sponsors or anything.” Bono in her letter objected to the Kaepernick ads’ slogan “believing in something even if it means sacrificing everything.” In her view, she said, it was families who lost an armed services member who “literally sacrificed everything.” USA Gymnastics said it would continue to look for a permanent leader as it tried “to transform the organization at all levels to ensure athlete safety.” Three-time Olympic gold medalist Aly Raisman on Monday criticized Bono’s former role working for law firm Faegre Baker Daniels, which was hired by USA Gymnastics when sex abuse allegations were reported against former USA Gymnastics team doctor Larry Nassar. Raisman said lawyers at Faegre Baker Daniels knew of Nassar’s abuse in 2015, but the doctor continued to abuse children for a further 13 months. “Why hire someone associated with the firm that helped cover up our abuse,” Raisman wrote. USA Gymnastics’ board of directors on Monday said Bono’s work at Faegre Baker Daniels was not related to any investigation."

-6.550705833249946," Sponsors EA and Nike say concerned about Ronaldo rape claims (The Oct. 4 story was refiled to remove an extraneous paragraph on Nike not responding to request to confirm statement) (Reuters) - Sportswear maker Nike Inc NKE.N and video game maker Electronic Arts Inc EA.O and said on Thursday they were concerned about rape allegations against Cristiano Ronaldo, one of the world's best soccer players. The 33-year-old athlete on Tuesday denied rape allegations leveled against him by a woman who sued him in court in Nevada. “We are deeply concerned by the disturbing allegations and will continue to closely monitor the situation,” Nike said in a statement to Reuters. Nike has worked with Ronaldo since 2003 and in 2016 announced a lifetime deal with him worth which could be worth as much as $1 billion, according to Forbes magazine. Electronic Arts has featured Ronaldo on the cover of its EA Sports’ FIFA series for two years. “We have seen the concerning report that details allegations against Cristiano Ronaldo,” an EA spokesperson said in an email to Reuters. “We are closely monitoring the situation, as we expect cover athletes and ambassadors to conduct themselves in a manner that is consistent with EA’s values,” the company said. Kathryn Mayorga sued Ronaldo in a district court in Clark County, Nevada, alleging he raped her in 2009 in a Las Vegas hotel penthouse suite. The player has said his conscience was clear and that he would await the results of any investigation. “I firmly deny the accusations being issued against me. Rape is an abominable crime that goes against everything that I am and believe in,” the world-famous athlete wrote in a tweet to his 75 million followers. Ronaldo transferred from soccer team Real Madrid to Italian champions Juventus this summer for 100 million euros. Juventus broke their silence on the situation Wednesday afternoon on Twitter, fully backing Ronaldo. “Cristiano Ronaldo has shown in recent months his great professionalism and dedication, which is appreciated by everyone at Juventus,” the team tweeted. “The events allegedly dating back to almost 10 years ago do not change this opinion, which is shared by anyone who has come into contact with this great champion,” Juventus said."
-12.512900539012476," Nike shares dip after forecast disappoints (Reuters) - Nike NKE.N shares fell as much as 3 percent on Wednesday after the company disappointed Wall Street by not raising its full-year forecast following a sales boost from its Colin Kaepernick ad campaign. The campaign, along with Nike’s increasing efforts to woo younger customers with new sneakers and jerseys, had led to expectations that the company would lift its outlook for the year. “A combination of heightened expectations going into the company’s results, a slight disappointment in gross margins, as well as tepid second-quarter guidance is causing a wobbliness in the company’s stock,” Wedbush Securities analyst Christopher Svezia said. Nike CEO Mark Parker said on Tuesday following quarterly results that the marketing blitz, which marked the 30th anniversary of its “Just Do It” slogan, was driving an uptick in customer traffic and “record” customer engagement. The ad featuring Kaepernick, first aired in early September days after Nike’s fiscal quarter ended, revived a nationwide debate that began in 2016 when the San Francisco 49ers quarterback began kneeling during the national anthem at games to protest police shootings of unarmed black men. In reaction to the ad, protesters burned Nike shoes and called for a boycott of its products. Nike shares fell 3 percent the day after the ad was first aired. Yet in the following weeks, analysts and marketing experts said they expected the ad to bring more attention to Nike and bump up sales. Nike currently expects full-year revenue growth at the lower end of a high-single digit range due to a stronger dollar. In the quarter ended August, Oregon-based Nike’s revenue rose 10 percent, beating Wall Street estimates. Profit also exceeded expectations even as higher commodity costs hit margins. After the report, analysts remained bullish and at least five raised their price targets on Nike’s stock. Morgan Stanley lifted its target to a Wall Street high of $103, well above the median target of $87. “We advocate buying the dip as its margin expansion story remains in early innings,” Morgan Stanley analysts said in a client report, calling it their “top pick.” The company’s strong fundamentals and gains in market share in North America, its biggest market, have kept Wall Street upbeat, with 22 of 37 analysts rating its stock “buy” or higher. “The underlying fundamentals or the building blocks of the story are still intact,” Wedbush’s Svezia said. As part of efforts to grab more market share from rivals Adidas ADSGn.DE and Under Armour UAA.N, Nike has focused on its digital platform and offered new lines of Jordan and React sneakers and World Cup jerseys. Nike's shares, which have outperformed Puma PUMG.DE and Adidas with a 35 percent rise this year, were down a little less than $1 at $83.98 on Wednesday afternoon. Kaepernick and representatives for the player did not respond to Reuters’ messages and calls requesting comment."

The ad as well as Nike’s efforts to woo younger customers with its new Jordan and React sneakers and its World Cup jerseys had taken expectations to a fever pitch, with most investors and analysts hoping for a raise in its outlook. The expectations were “elevated” going into earnings and a “conservative 2Q guide helped lead to a buying opportunity for a resurgent company that is solidly executing strategy,” Wedbush analyst Christopher Svezia said. Shares of Nike, which have risen 35 percent this year, were down about $2 at $82.51 in premarket trading. The company said on an earnings call on Tuesday the ad campaign, which included the Kaepernick ad and was meant to mark the 30th anniversary of its “Just Do It” slogan, was driving an uptick in traffic and “record” customer engagement. The ad revived a raging debate in the United States that started in 2016 when Kaepernick, then with the San Francisco 49ers, began kneeling to protest multiple police shootings of unarmed black men. Many protestors burned Nike shoes and called for a boycott of its products. Nike stock fell 3.2 percent, the day after the ad was launched. In the weeks that followed, several analysts and marketing experts said they expected the new ad to create increased interest in the brand and bump sales. Nike said it expects full-year revenue to rise in the in the lower end of a high single-digit range due to a stronger dollar. For the first quarter, the Beaverton, Oregon-based company reported a 10 percent rise in revenue, beating analysts’ estimates. Its profit also came in above estimates despite higher commodity costs dampening margins. Post earnings, Wall Street remained bullish with at least five analysts raising their price targets on the stock, with Morgan Stanley lifting it to a street high of $103. The median price target on the stock is $87. “We advocate buying the dip as its margin expansion story remains in early innings,” Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a note to clients. “NKE remains our top pick.” The company’s strong fundamentals, market share gains in North America and exciting new products has kept Wall Street bullish, with 22 of 37 analysts rating its stock “buy” or higher. In efforts to take back more market share from rival Adidas AG and newcomer Under Armour Inc, Nike has pushed hard with a slew of new product launches and a renewed focus on its digital platform. “The underlying fundamentals or the building blocks of the story are still intact,” Svezia said.

-12.512900539012476," Nike profit tops targets but margins disappoint some (Reuters) - Nike Inc NKE.N topped first-quarter profit on Tuesday, but a small rise in gross margins and no change in its 2019 forecast despite the launch of a successful ad campaign was not enough for some investors, sending shares down 4 percent after hours. “I think where the market might be slightly disappointed is around the gross margins ... it is slightly weaker than expected,” MainFirst Bank analyst John Guy said. Nike gross margins rose 50 basis points to 44.2 percent in the reported quarter, in line with average analysts’ estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “The numbers are good, but they weren’t wow enough,” said Jeff Auxier, founder & portfolio manager at Auxier Asset Management. For the second quarter, during which it launched its campaign featuring former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, Nike forecast revenue growth and gross margin expansion similar to the reported quarter. Many analysts said the campaign plays to Nike’s core demographics in the United States, and has translated to 61 percent more merchandise sold during the period, according to Thomson Reuters Proprietary Research. The Oregon-based athletic shoe maker also expects costs to grow in the low teens in the current quarter on higher investments in its digital platform and sports marketing during kickoff of the NBA and NFL seasons. The company’s demand creation expense, or costs related to advertising and promotion, rose 13 percent to $964 million in the first quarter. The company also maintained its forecast for fiscal 2019. (reut.rs/2OO7QLh) However, Nike's direct-to-consumer model helped sales in North America rise 6 percent, its second straight rise, showing signs of recovery after competition from rivals Adidas AG ADSGn.DE and Under Armour UAA.N eroded sales in three out of the last four quarters. “We returned to strong growth in North America even faster than what we had expected,” Nike Chief Financial Officer Andrew Campion said on a post-earnings call with analysts. Sales in North America rose 6 percent in the reported quarter. Revenue rose 9.7 percent to $9.95 billion, beating estimates of $9.94 billion. The company’s net income rose to $1.09 billion, or 67 cents per share, in the first quarter ended Aug. 31, from $950 million, or 57 cents per share, a year earlier.

-20.6624757002037," Nike's Kaepernick ad spurs spike in sold-out items (Reuters) - Nike Inc NKE.N has sold out 61 percent more merchandise since the controversial ad campaign featuring former NFL player Colin Kaepernick appeared earlier this month, according to data on the company's online sales from Thomson Reuters Proprietary Research. Kaepernick, who sparked a national controversy by kneeling during the national anthem, first tweeted the ad on the Labor Day weekend, which immediately sparked demands for a boycott of the company’s products. President Donald Trump also tweeted, without providing evidence, that “Nike is getting absolutely killed with anger and boycotts”. But the research by Thomson Reuters, conducted in collaboration with StyleSage Co, showed here the world's largest sportswear maker sold out far more items between Sept. 3 and Sept. 13 than in the 10-day period before the ad came out. Nike discounted fewer products in the 10-day period after the ad and saw its Colin Kaepernick women’s jersey sell out on Sept. 17, the research also showed. “These strong statistics reinforce the notion that Nike is standing firm – and not just in a social context,” said Jharonne Martis, director of consumer research at Thomson Reuters. “They don’t need to participate in the discounting that tends to plague other retail brands.” Thomson Reuters is the parent company of Reuters News. Shares in Nike have rebounded from an initial drop when the first versions of the ad were released, hitting a record high a little over a week later. The stock is now up nearly 7 percent since the drop, outperforming a 1.9 percent gain for the Dow .DJI over the same period, helped by at least four analysts raising price targets ahead of first-quarter results on Sept. 25. Social media sentiment around the company, which dived in the immediate aftermath of the ad, also turned positive earlier this week, according to Thomson Reuters’ Eikon Social Media Monitor. “(Nike’s) new “Just Do It” ad campaign with Colin Kaepernick was a stroke of genius ... this premeditated move was another subtle but significant sign of Nike’s strength and confidence in its position in the marketplace,” Canaccord Genuity analyst Camilo Lyon wrote in a client note last week.

-12.367955134005618," Walmart's Jet.com to offer Nike products in bid for urban consumers NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walmart’s Jet.com said on Thursday it will sell Nike Inc products and offer more delivery options, beginning in its top market of New York City, in a bid to sharpen its aim for affluent, urban consumers and better compete with e-commerce rivals like Amazon.com Inc. Walmart Inc acquired Jet for $3.3 billion in August 2016, a deal that was widely considered a watershed moment for its then-struggling e-commerce operation as it got access to both technology and talent through Jet founder Marc Lore and his team. “We both had a keen interest in serving that urban affluent customer,” said Jet’s chief customer officer, David Echegoyen. The relationship with Nike, scheduled for kick-off in October, would “bring customers on Jet a set of everything,” he added. Nike launched a pilot to sell footwear and apparel on Amazon last year, in a dramatic turnaround after long steering clear of the world’s largest online retailer. That partnership was a signal that Amazon was serious about fighting counterfeit goods on its site and was courting once weary fashion brands. This summer, Nike’s chief executive officer told analysts on a conference call that the partnership was “progressing well.” Jet’s relationship with Nike is less about the Nike product and more about how consumers go about discovering a sneaker or running shoe, Jet executives said. Jet said it is still finalizing the line-up of Nike products to be offered on the site.Jet is separately courting urban millennial customers through initiatives in another category: grocery. “We’re bringing a grocery experience together with a fashion experience with a home experience that customers can check out in one cart,” Jet’s CEO, Simon Belsham, said. Through Parcel, the last-mile delivery tech company acquired by Walmart in 2017, most New York City consumers will be able to arrange three-hour scheduled delivery windows for groceries - now including fresh produce - and other merchandise from local shops. Jet said it is making plans to offer these delivery options nationwide, but will first test them in New York City. Jet executives said the initiatives were not in response to Amazon Prime Now, the company’s two-hour delivery service that lets customers shop Whole Foods and other local stores in cities around the world. Many analysts view Amazon as unmatched in handling distribution and delivery for non-perishable goods, meaning other e-commerce players may be challenged to offer the same level of service. Amazon has more than 150 fulfillment centers around the world, the company has said."
-5.765895233736563," Trump targets Nike as Kaepernick ads spark boycott calls WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday criticized Nike Inc for its new advertising campaign featuring Colin Kaepernick, the NFL quarterback who sparked controversy by kneeling in protest during the national anthem. Trump, without offering evidence, said in a post on Twitter that the sportswear company was “getting absolutely killed with anger and boycotts.” He also continued to blast National Football League players for their protests over racial and social injustice. Representatives for Nike could not be immediately reached for comment on Trump’s tweet. Shares of the company were up less than one percent in midmorning trade on Wednesday; the stock had dropped nearly 4 percent at one point on Tuesday. The footwear and apparel maker’s campaign this week further stoked a national debate over social justice that Kaepernick and other NFL players sparked with their protests aimed at addressing police brutality against minorities, racial injustice, and reforming the criminal justice system. Trump has embraced the issue as a political cause, frequently criticizing players for taking a knee at games and questioning their patriotism. Critics have defended their protests as a fundamental American right to free speech. On Tuesday, he criticized Nike’s decision but also appeared to defend the right for such movements. Marketing experts predicted that the brand recognition sparked by the ads would be successful in the long run, despite current calls for boycotts on social media. NFL players and the league are continuing to negotiate over the issue of protests. (The story was refiled to add dropped words in the lead paragraph)"

-5.19992697987327," Kaepernick ads spark boycott calls, but Nike is seen as winning in the end (Reuters) - Protesters burned their Nike shoes, investors sold shares and some consumers demanded a boycott after the footwear and apparel maker launched an advertising campaign featuring Colin Kaepernick, the NFL quarterback who sparked a national controversy by kneeling during the national anthem. But the brand recognition that comes with the campaign may be just what the company wanted, and marketing experts predicted it would ultimately succeed. The ad revived a raging debate in the United States that started in 2016 when Kaepernick, then with the San Francisco 49ers, began kneeling to protest multiple police shootings of unarmed black men. “This is right on the money for Nike. They stand for this irreverent, rebellious attitude. In this case, it’s reinforcing the brand,” said Erich Joachimsthaler, CEO of strategy consulting firm Vivaldi. While some fans praised Kaepernick and other players who joined him in kneeling as patriotic dissenters, critics led by U.S. President Donald Trump blasted the protesters as ungrateful and disrespectful. Trump called Nike’s campaign “a terrible decision” in an interview with the Daily Caller published on Tuesday, but he also showed some respect for Kaepernick’s right to speak out. “As much as I disagree with the Colin Kaepernick endorsement, in another way — I mean, I wouldn’t have done it. In another way, it is what this country is all about, that you have certain freedoms to do things that other people think you shouldn’t do,” Trump said. The NFL, which gave in to pressure from Trump and ordered players not to kneel on the field during the anthem, nonetheless praised Kaepernick. “The social justice issues that Colin and other professional athletes have raised deserve our attention and action,” said Jocelyn Moore, the NFL’s executive vice president of communications and public affairs. In the immediate backlash against the campaign, announced on Monday, Nike shares fell nearly 4 percent at one point on Tuesday and closed down 3.2 percent. Calls for a boycott fed social media buzz about the campaign. There were 2.7 million mentions of Nike over the previous 24 hours, the social media analysis firm Talkwalker said at midday, an increase of 135 percent over the previous week. After his protests, Kaepernick could not find a job for the 2017 season and sued the National Football League, accusing owners of colluding to blackball him. He is still without a team. Nike has sponsored Kaepernick since 2011 and said he will be one of several faces for a campaign marking the 30th anniversary of its “Just Do It” slogan. The ad refers to Kaepernick’s loss of NFL income with the quote: “Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything.” Some who were offended by the choice posted social media pictures of Nike shoes they had set on fire or socks with the Nike swoosh cut out. Twitter user Sean Clancy, or @sclancy79, posted a picture of a pair of Nike trainers on fire on Tuesday that was retweeted 20,000 times.Athletes including Serena Williams, LeBron James, Kevin Durant and Chris Paul showed support. The controversy may have been a convenient excuse for some investors to sell an over-valued stock, Vivaldi’s Joachimsthaler said. Christopher Svezia, a footwear and apparel analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc., said Nike shares were trading at roughly 30 times next year’s forecast earnings, compared with 24 percent for rival Adidas. “Nike more than anyone else really knows who their customer is,” Svezia said, describing them as largely 14- to 22-year-old males. Matt Powell, a senior adviser with market research firm NPD Group, predicted the boycott would fizzle. “Old angry white guys are not a core demographic for Nike,” he said. Barry Lowenthal, CEO of The Media Kitchen, praised the campaign and said Nike has long proven successful in using celebrity endorsements to promote its brand, a precursor to what is known as influencer marking in the social media age. “These kind of endorsement deals were the first version of influencer marketing. Of course they know it works. It’s classic product placement,” Lowenthal said. Even former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad weighed in, tweeting: “The #NFL season will start this week, unfortunately once again @Kaepernick7 is not on a NFL roster.”"

A fresh round of U.S tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods are expected to take effect after a public comment period ends on Sept. 6. U.S. President Donald Trump has told his aides he is ready to impose the tariffs as soon as the public comment period ends, according to a Bloomberg report last week. Talks between Canada and the United States to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) ended on a sour note on Friday, but officials set plans to resume their talks on Wednesday. Despite the looming tariff threats and trade uncertainties, the major U.S. indexes closed higher in August, with the Nasdaq posting its largest monthly gain since January. “This has more to do with the fact that the markets have had a strong run in the past two to three weeks and it is normal for people to take a little bit of profits off the table,” said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist and senior portfolio manager at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York. The dollar rose nearly half a percent against a basket of major currencies as trade concerns escalated. Shares of trade-sensitive Caterpillar and Boeing slipped 0.6 percent. Verizon fell 1.23 percent after a Barclays downgrade to “equal weight”. At 8:50 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were down 73 points, or 0.28 percent. S&P 500 e-minis were down 4.25 points, or 0.15 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were down 22.25 points, or 0.29 percent.

-4.503820301270061," UPDATE 1-Nike shares hit as Kaepernick ad spurs boycott (Adds more reaction, comment from analysts) Sept 4 (Reuters) - Shares of Nike Inc fell 3 percent on Tuesday as calls for a boycott of the sportswear giant gained traction on social media following its choice of Colin Kaepernick as a face for the 30th anniversary of its “Just Do It” slogan. Former San Francisco quarterback Kaepernick, the first NFL player to kneel during the national anthem as a protest against racism, posted a black-and-white close-up of himself on Instagram on Monday featuring the Nike logo and “Just do it” slogan, along with the quote: “Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything.” Over 30,000 people were tweeting with the hashtag #NikeBoycott on Tuesday morning U.S. eastern time, making it among the top trending topics on Twitter. Some posted images of themselves burning and ripping their Nike shoes and apparel. “First the @NFL forces me to choose between my favorite sport and my country. I chose country,” Twitter user @sclancy79 said in a post retweeted 16,000 times. “Then @Nike forces me to choose between my favorite shoes and my country. Since when did the American Flag and the National Anthem become offensive?”, Still, there were a large number of other users who took positively to Nike taking a stand on social issues. Athletes including LeBron James and Kevin Durant showed support, posting images of Kaepernick’s ad on their Instagram profiles. Even former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad weighed in, tweeting: “The #NFL season will start this week, unfortunately once again @Kaepernick7 is not on a NFL roster. Even though he is one of the best Quarterbacks in the league.” Retail industry analysts were divided on whether the heat around the campaign would be a commercial positive for Nike or ultimately alienate and lose customers. “The alt-right calls for a Nike boycott will fail just like the boycott of Dick’s Sporting Goods failed,” said Matt Powell, a senior advisor with market research firm NPD Group. “Old angry white guys are not a core demographic for Nike.” Gun rights supporters called for the boycott of Dick’s Sporting Goods earlier this year after the retailer stopped selling assault rifles and high-capacity magazines following a massacre at a Florida high school in February. Another analyst, GlobalData Retail’s Neil Saunders, said the campaign will harm Nike in middle America, where it is battle Germany’s Adidas for dominance in the sneaker market. “The company’s stand may go down well on its native West Coast; it will be far less welcome in many other locations,” he said. U.S. President Donald Trump has been critical of athletes taking a knee during the national anthem and has said he would love to see NFL owners fire football players who disrespect the American flag. Nike, who confirmed on Monday that Kaepernick was part of the campaign and called him “one of the inspirational athletes of his generation”, did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday.

-7.213079079106182," Athletics: Kenya's Okeyo banned for life for taking Nike money LONDON (Reuters) - Former senior Kenyan athletics official David Okeyo has been banned from the sport for life and fined $50,000 after being found guilty of diverting hundreds of thousands of dollars of sponsorship payments for his personal use. Okeyo, a former Secretary-General and Vice President of Athletics Kenya (AK) as well as a member of the IAAF Council, and Joseph Kinyua, a former Treasurer of Athletics Kenya, were investigated by the sport’s ethics board in relation to payments made by U.S. sportswear company Nike between 2003 and 2015. In a 74-page judgement released on Thursday, the Board found that on many occasions Okeyo did not disclose to AK the withdrawals of the Nike money he made from AK bank accounts and he could also not show any evidence of what the money had been used for. He was thus found to have breached the ethics code on 10 occasions after taking sponsorship money that “could have been better directed to support the development of the sport of athletics in Kenya” and expelled him from his position on the IAAF Council. He was ordered to pay the $50,000 fine to AK. Kinyua was found by the board to have “engaged in similar conduct” but as he was not an IAAF official at the time, it was deemed that he was not bound by the ethics rules in place at the time and hence he escaped sanction. The two men, along with former AK President Isaiah Kiplagat, were provisionally suspended at the end of 2015. Kiplagat has since died and consequently the ethics board dropped its investigation into his activities. Okeyo and Kinyua deny wrongdoing, saying that the money was legitimate payment for their own expenses and expertise and for payments they personally made to athletes. Okeyo said: “My lawyers will appeal the ruling. I think it’s discriminatory. All three of us were signatories to our bank. We will appeal.” Kinyua told Reuters on Thursday that he was happy with the decision and that “justice was done”. At the time of their suspensions Nike said the company had acted with integrity in its dealings with AK and that the “expectation and understanding” of the sponsorship deal was that the funds would be used to support and service the teams and athletes. The judgement, however, showed that Nike had clearly been concerned about how the funds were being used and that the ethics panel was satisfied that in many, though not all of the instances it investigated, funds were being siphoned off. “In failing to disclose the honorarium and service fee payments to the membership of AK, the panel is comfortably satisfied that the defendants diverted funds of AK for their own direct or indirect personal benefit, as charged,” the Board said in its findings. “In the view of the panel, Mr Okeyo’s conduct in failing as Secretary General of AK ... constituted conduct likely to bring the sport of athletics into disrepute.” On one occasion in 2010 Okeyo withdrew $200,000 from AK accounts, saying subsequently that the money was used by AK to promote its athletics programs. However, the panel said that Okeyo could not produce any evidence to show that the executive board had approved this course of action, “nor did he provide any details as to what programs had been supported, nor did he furnish any evidence by way of payment vouchers or supporting invoices to corroborate his account.” The report added: “Under cross-examination, when asked to explain the purpose for the withdrawal of $200,000, Mr Okeyo could provide no explanation, other than that he had been instructed to withdraw the money.” Okeyo has also been charged with the extortion of money from athletes but the ethics panel will issue a separate decision in relation to that charge."
-13.561594847824699," Danish jeweler Pandora hires new China chief COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Jeweller Pandora has recruited Geena Tok from Nike to head its business in China, where the Danish company has been challenged by a rise in sales on the grey market. Pandora has 200 stores and employs more than 1,400 people in China but has said it needs to counter China’s grey market, where increasing numbers of jewelry pieces are imported from other markets and sold online. Last month Pandora, the world’s largest jewelry maker by production volume, said it would lower retail prices in the country by an average of 15 percent. Chinese resident Tok joins Pandora next month, having spent 17 years with Nike in the United States, Thailand, India and now in China, where she is leading the sports retailer’s stores and e-commerce business. Tok will replace Anthony Asinas, who taking up a new role as Pandora’s Hong Kong and Macau chief. Pandora, best known for its charm bracelets, warned in May of a surprise slowdown in China, which accounts for about 12 percent of its total sales. China is a key growth market for affordable luxury jewelry makers such as Pandora, with the country’s growing middle class willing to spend at a time when mall shopping in other big markets such as the United States and Britain is declining."
-13.279170583210284," Nike stores closed in South Africa amid outcry over racist web post (Contains offensive language in paragraph 3.) JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Some Nike NKE.N stores were closed in South Africa on Wednesday after public outcry over a racist comment by a man that local media said had links to the sportswear company. Nike declined to comment on the store closures, but issued a statement reiterating its “long-standing commitment to diversity, inclusion and respect”, adding that the man seen in a video posted online was not a company employee. In the video, taken at a beach resort, a white man with a South African accent says: “And not one kaffir in sight. Fucking heaven on earth.” The “K word” as it is known in South Africa is apartheid-era slang for a black person and is regarded as a deeply offensive slur on a par with the “N word” in America. Times Live online news service said the man in the video was married to a merchandising director at Nike. A Nike spokeswoman in London declined to comment and Reuters was unable to independently verify the person’s identity. South African media reported Nike stores had closed their doors. Reuters witnesses confirmed that two were shut at a mall in the Sandton district of Johannesburg. The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF), a party known for its hard-left and African nationalist positions, said it would file a criminal complaint against the man in the video. In January, protesters led by the EFF trashed six H&M stores HMb.ST over an ad by the retail chain which featured a black child modeling a sweatshirt with the slogan ""coolest monkey in the jungle."" South Africa remains deeply scarred by its apartheid and colonial past, with the racial reconciliation embraced by the late president Nelson Mandela frequently marred by racist incidents."

-5.798568308395295," Adidas shares jump as North America growth outpaces Nike BERLIN (Reuters) - Adidas reported strong second-quarter results on Thursday, as its sales growth outpaced rival Nike in North America where new styles are proving popular even as the German sportswear brand stagnated in western Europe. Shares in the company famous for its three-stripe brand soared more than 10 percent to a four-month high, putting them on track for their best day since the group increased its financial guidance in March. The results are the latest endorsement of a strategy pursued by Chief Executive Kasper Rorsted since taking over in 2016, focused on improving profitability as well as expanding in North America and China and pushing sales via ecommerce. Some investors feared that Adidas would struggle as the popularity of its retro Stan Smith and Superstar shoes waned in the last 18 months. Promoted by singer Pharrell Williams, the Superstar was the top selling shoe in the U.S. market in 2016. But Rorsted says Adidas has managed the fashion cycle carefully, trying not to oversupply old styles, while stepping up promotion for new lines like its springy “Ultra Boost” running shoes and the “Parley” made out of recycled ocean plastic. The 1980s “Continental” leather sneakers that were relaunched in June are already selling out, Rorsted said, and a broadening of a partnership with rapper Kanye West is planned, after earlier designs were made only in very limited quantities. Tighter control of supply helped Adidas sell more shoes at full prices in the quarter, helping to counteract higher marketing spending due to the soccer World Cup. GRAPHIC: World Cup kit manufacturers tmsnrt.rs/2JiAK6W However, Rorsted admitted that the company failed to focus enough on the launch of new products in western Europe, prompting management changes in the region. Sales were likely to stay flat in the region in the second half of the year, he said. While Adidas has been taking market share from Nike in North America, the U.S. firm has been powering ahead in Europe, Middle East and Africa, with sales up 10 percent in its March to May fiscal fourth quarter. Group sales rose 10 percent to 5.26 billion euros ($6 billion) after currency effects, beating the 8 percent expected by analysts, while attributable net profit of 396 million was also ahead of the average forecast for 386 million. Adidas saw sales growth in North America slow slightly to 16 percent, but that was still well ahead of the 3 percent growth Nike reported for March to May. In greater China, Adidas sales growth accelerated to 27 percent, slightly ahead of Nike’s 25 percent, and they jumped 14 percent in Russia, which hosted the World Cup. Nike teams dominated the final rounds of the World Cup, but Rorsted said the tournament was still a success as Adidas sold more than 8 million shirts and more than 10 million balls, and saw a boost to downloads of its app, advertised in stadiums. Adidas said it was taking an impairment of 475 million euros related to the Reebok trademark in 2016, but it said the restatement had no impact on its cash position and reiterated its guidance for 2018 and beyond. Adidas bought the Reebok brand in 2005, but it has performed poorly since. Rorsted has given Reebok until 2020 to return to profitability and said it should be helped by a new partnership with British designer Victoria Beckham. He noted that Reebok sales in North America rose 6 percent despite many store closures and it narrowed its losses."

4.999954078835944," Nike favored to beat soccer juggernaut Adidas at World Cup (Reuters) - In a World Cup brimming with upsets, Nike Inc NKE.N looks on track to defeat soccer juggernaut and archrival Adidas AG ADSGn.DE in the closely watched jersey sponsorship battle. The Nike swoosh decorates the outfits of Brazil, France and England, the sides in the quarter-finals most favored by betting websites to win the World Cup, plus Croatia. Top German sports brand Adidas has Belgium, Russia and Sweden in the quarter-finals, with the group of eight rounded out by Uruguay, sponsored by Puma SE PUMG.DE. The combined accomplishments of Nike-sponsored teams in Russia mark a major success for the U.S. sports apparel maker as it pushes to increase global soccer-related sales that reached more than $2 billion in fiscal 2018. “While Adidas dominates the European leagues and the U.S. professional league, certainly any market share that Nike can pick up in a nontraditional U.S. sport can only bode well for the stock price and brand,” said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Sports brands typically sell the bulk of their fan merchandise ahead of the World Cup, but a team’s success on the field can generate extra demand for gear emblazoned with its emblems and colors, especially if its progress is unexpected. Nike kitted out more teams than Adidas for the first time in Brazil in 2014. Adidas fought back this year, sponsoring 12 of the 32 participating teams, including strong early contenders Germany and Spain, along with host Russia. Nike supplied shirts for 10 countries this year. To view a graphic on Nike extending leads in the World Cup jersey battle, click: reut.rs/2KP51I8 The tournament took a disastrous turn for Adidas last Wednesday, with the unexpected elimination of 2014 champion Germany. Shares of Adidas, Germany’s team sponsor, fell 2.7 percent in the following session. In 2014, Germany accounted for a third of Adidas’ roughly 9 million team jersey sales, Wedbush analyst Christopher Svezia wrote in a recent client note, with an incremental 10 percent of those sales resulting from Germany’s tournament victory. Over the weekend, high-profile Adidas-sponsored teams Argentina and Spain were eliminated. Likewise, Mexico lost to Nike-sponsored Brazil on Monday. Heading into this year’s World Cup, Adidas downplayed the sporting event’s potential effect on sales, pointing to Russia’s tepid economy. But the World Cup remains a major marketing opportunity for Adidas, which is one of seven FIFA partners and the supplier of the World Cup match ball since 1970. As well as team jerseys, sponsorship of top individual players is critical for the promotion of soccer shoes. Ahead of the World Cup, Nike expected 60 percent of players heading to Russia to use its footwear. Since the start of the World Cup on June 14, Nike’s stock is up almost 3 percent, helped mostly by a strong quarterly report and sales outlook last Thursday. Adidas has lost about 5 percent."

For the quarter, the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq all posted gains. The Dow edged up 0.7 percent, the S&P 500 rose 2.94 percent, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq jumped 6.33 percent. The small-cap Russell 2000, whose components are more domestically focused than their large-cap counterparts, climbed 7.4 percent. Like the Russell, the S&P’s major sectors reflected some skittishness over trade.

Nike shares ended the day up 11.1 percent to $79.68, their biggest one-day gain in nearly four years. Nike was the top boost to the Dow and the S&P 500. The S&P 500 bank sector index ended the day barely changed after earlier touching a one-week high. The Federal Reserve late on Thursday reported that U.S. lenders cleared the second part of the Fed’s annual stress tests, though the Fed placed conditions on some, restricting Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan Stanley from increasing capital distributions. Wells Fargo & Co was a bright spot, rising 3.4 percent. Friday’s session reflected momentary relief from trade concerns that rattled the market earlier in the week, several investors said, though the major indexes pared gains in the last hour of trading. “There’s really not a lot of headlines going on,” said Ryan Detrick, senior market strategist for LPL Financial in Charlotte, North Carolina. “We’re having a late-week bounce back from earlier worries.” Investors took in stride U.S. Commerce Department data that showed consumer spending slowing as the core personal consumption expenditures price index, a measure of inflation, hit the Federal Reserve’s 2 percent annual target for the first time in six years.

6.58718011834321," Nike shares hit record as investors cheer North America rebound (Reuters) - Nike Inc's NKE.N shares jumped 12 percent to their all-time high on Friday after the world's largest shoe maker saw a major sales rebound in its North America business and forecast strong growth for 2019. At least 14 Wall Street analysts raised their price targets following Nike’s better-than-expected quarterly results, with Susquehanna the most bullish, raising its target by $14. “Nike delivered the closest thing to a complete game for a public company,” said Barclays analyst Matthew McClintock, who boosted his target to $85 from $80. The company's focus on its digital platform and launch of sneakers, such as Air Max 270 and Epic React, not only helped it fight off competition from German rivals Adidas ADSGn.DE and Puma, but also deliver on its promise of a significant reversal in its home market. The Oregon-based company is also gaining on the resurgence of ‘90s fashion trends that is helping boost sales of its classic sneakers. Industry research shows that sneaker sales rose 10 percent globally last year. Nike shares rose to $79.98 in early trading, adding $13 billion to its market value of about $115 billion. The stock was the top gainer on the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI. Sales at its North America business rose 3.3 percent in the quarter after having fallen for most of the year. “The Nike story is officially back at this point and investors will no longer have an opportunity to ‘wait for a better entry point’ as all signs point to an acceleration,” McClintock said. Analysts at Credit Suisse said strong results prove that several years of distribution disruption, bloated inventories, lackluster innovation, and market share losses are in the past. The company also said it expects 2019 revenue to be in the high single-digit range, compared with its earlier forecast of mid-to-high single-digit growth. It also announced a $15 billion buyback program. ""Nike's business is beginning to inflect in NA, and we expect the company to continue to recapture the share it has lost to Adidas ADSGn.DE,"" Jefferies analysts said in a note titled 'Share Gains Back = ADI-os!' Nike’s shares have risen nearly 15 percent this year, while Adidas’ shares have gained 10 percent. Nike trades at 26.5 times forward earnings, versus Adidas’ 20.50 times. Wall Street’s sentiment on the stock is bullish, with 21 of the 36 analysts covering the stock rating it “buy”.

The S&P 500 bank sector index was last up 1.65 percent after touching its highest level in a week after U.S. lenders cleared the second part of the Federal Reserve’s annual stress tests. Wells Fargo led the gains, surging 4.6 percent, while Citigroup, M&T Bank and a host of other banks were up 1 percent or more. “It has not been a huge news day in the U.S., probably some of it (market gains) is a snap back based on the recent down markets that we’ve had,” said Curtis Holden, senior investment officer at Tanglewood Total Wealth Management. “The fact that the banks have got good news from the recent Fed test is another factor that’s helping as well.” Also boosting financials was Commerce Department data that showed core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) in May hit the Federal Reserve’s 2-percent target for the first time in six years. Despite a 0.4 percent drop in Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley as they cleared the stress test with conditions, the S&P financial sector was up 1.24 percent, a day after having snapped a 13-day losing streak. At 13:17 pm ET the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 254.20 points, or 1.05 percent, at 24,470.25, the S&P 500 was up 22.39 points, or 0.82 percent, at 2,738.70 and the Nasdaq Composite was up 45.58 points, or 0.61 percent, at 7,549.27. All 11 of the major S&P sectors were higher, with the materials, industrials and energy sectors posting gains of more than 1 percent. Constellation Brands fell 4.7 percent after the Corona beer maker’s quarterly profit and full-year earnings forecast missed analysts’ estimates. Vertex Pharma jumped 13.5 percent, the most on the S&P, after rival Galapagos’s cystic fibrosis program reported disappointing trial data. KB Homes rose 6.1 percent, and led a rally in homebuilders, after its second-quarter results beat Wall Street estimates. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners for a 2.90-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 1.67-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P index recorded 10 new 52-week highs and one new low, while the Nasdaq recorded 47 new highs and 52 new lows. (Reporting by Amy Caren Daniel in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta)"

Bank shares jumped after U.S. lenders cleared the second part of the Federal Reserve’s stress test, pushing the sector 0.88 percent higher after it broke a 13-day losing streak on Thursday, and helping U.S. stocks to recover some losses. Nike also pushed U.S benchmark indexes higher after the world’s largest sneaker maker surged as much as 11.5 percent to a record peak on a strong earnings report. The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 276.37 points, or 1.14 percent, to 24,492.42, the S&P 500 gained 25.57 points, or 0.94 percent, to 2,741.88 and the Nasdaq Composite added 66.24 points, or 0.88 percent, to 7,569.92. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 1.20 percent. Earlier, the U.S. stock market briefly dipped on a report by the Axios news website that indicated President Donald Trump was keen for the U.S. to withdraw from the World Trade Organization; the market recovered after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Fox Business Network the report was wrong. The Axios report cited people involved in talks with Trump. The market’s wobbling was a reminder of heightened investor sensitivity to trade-related remarks or developments. “The markets are very much subject to headlines on trade and tariffs,” said Peter Cecchini, chief market strategist at Cantor Fitzgerald in New York. “They are important from the standpoint that trade globalization has been the cornerstone for growth and when you do something to sort of undermine that cornerstone, that’s a reasonable reason for concern.” The U.S. administration is due to impose tariffs on Chinese goods worth $34 billion beginning July 6, likely prompting a tit-for-tat response from Beijing. The pan-European FTSEurofirst 300 index rose 1.13 percent. The euro was set for its strongest day in a month after leaders at an EU summit reached an agreement on migration, rising 0.8 percent to $1.1658. The agreement eased a threat to German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s ruling coalition over the issue. While Asian stocks rose, the Chinese yuan suffered its worst month on record, losing 3 percent against the dollar in June as investors pulled money from a market likely to suffer from higher barriers to trade. The U.S. dollar was set for its strongest quarterly gains since the fourth quarter of 2016, helped by the U.S. Federal Reserve’s move to raise interest rates in June, and expectations of further hikes this year. The dollar index, tracking it against six major currencies, edged down 0.6 percent to 94.787 as the euro rose. The yield curve between two-year and 10-year U.S. notes flattened to 31 basis points, the flattest since 2007, after U.S. consumer spending data disappointed some analysts’ expectations. Some investors see its flattening as a sign recession may be around the corner. Oil prices extended gains to fresh highs on a tighter market as U.S. sanctions against Iran threatened to remove a substantial volume of crude oil from world markets amid rising demand. Brent crude rose 2 percent to $79.51 per barrel, while U.S. crude added 0.6 percent to $73.90, its highest since November 2014."

Nike’s shares surged as much as 13 percent after the company returned to growth in North America last quarter and gave an upbeat forecast for the year.

The gains in Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were lower as they cleared the test with conditions. Also boosting financials was Commerce Department data that showed core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) in May hit the Federal Reserve’s 2-percent target for the first time in six years. “Bank stocks really thrive in rising interest rate environment, we know that there are three or four rate hikes this year, and it’s starting to look like there will be a fourth one in December,” David McKnight, president of David McKnight & Co said. After a slight wobble on a report that President Donald Trump has said he wanted the United States to withdraw from the World Trade Organization, the markets regained their footing after Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Fox Business Network that the Axios report was wrong. Friday’s gains add a silver lining to what has been a somewhat turbulent week as the United States and China have gone back and forth over trade and tariffs as well as Chinese investments in American technologies. McKnight said that Trump does not want the trade war especially given the mid-term elections that are coming up and “people are recognizing that trade wars aren’t likely to happen, that’s calming the nerves of some of the investors”.

6.58718011834321," Nike shares soar as investors applaud N.America sales rebound June 29 (Reuters) - Nike Inc shares on Friday rose 10 percent premarket and were set to open at a record high, after the world’s largest shoe maker saw a major sales rebound at its North America business and forecast strong growth for 2019. At least 14 Wall Street analysts raised their price targets following Nike’s better-than-expected quarterly results, with Susquehanna the most bullish, raising its target by $14. “Nike delivered the closest thing to a complete game for a public company,” said Barclays analyst Matthew McClintock, who boosted his target to $85 from $80. The company’s focus on its digital platform and launch of sneakers, such as Air Max 270 and Epic React, not only helped it fight off competition from German rivals Adidas and Puma, but also deliver on its promise of a significant reversal in its home market. The Oregon-based company is also gaining on the resurgence of ‘90s fashion trends that is helping boost sales of its classic sneakers. Industry research shows that sneaker sales rose 10 percent globally last year. Sales at its North America business rose 3.3 percent in the quarter after having fallen for most of the year. “The Nike story is officially back at this point and investors will no longer have an opportunity to ‘wait for a better entry point’ as all signs point to an acceleration,” McClintock said. Analysts at Credit Suisse said strong results prove that several years of distribution disruption, bloated inventories, lackluster innovation, and market share losses are in the past. The company also said it expects 2019 revenue to be in the high single-digit range, compared with its earlier forecast of mid-to-high single-digit growth. It also announced a $15 billion buyback program. “Nike’s business is beginning to inflect in NA, and we expect the company to continue to recapture the share it has lost to Adidas,” Jefferies analysts said in a note titled ‘Share Gains Back = ADI-os!’ The Dow component’s stock has risen nearly 15 percent this year, while Adidas’ shares have gained 10 percent. Nike trades at 26.5 times forward earnings, versus Adidas’ 20.50 times. Nike’s class B shares were up 9.7 percent at $78.67 in premarket trading and were the third biggest percentage gainers among New York Stock Exchange listed companies. “They are becoming a halo brand,” Jessica Ramirez, retail analyst at Jane Hali & Associates.

6.58718011834321," Nike returns to growth in North America, tops estimates (Reuters) - Nike Inc NKE.N beat fourth-quarter profit and revenue estimates as new launches and focus on direct-to-customer sales helped reverse declining sales in North America for the first time in a year. The Dow component’s shares rose 8 percent to $77.40 and were on track to hit a record at open on Friday after the company also announced a new $15 billion buyback program and said it expected fiscal 2019 revenue at the higher end of its earlier forecast. The Oregon-based athletic shoe maker has struggled in North America, its biggest market, as it battles tough competition from a resurgent Adidas ADSGn.DE and Puma, as well as bankruptcies of sports retailers such as Sports Authority and Sports Chalet. Nike has responded with an emphasis on new launches and selling directly to customers through its stores and online, while also partnering with Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O. The company launched several sneakers in the fourth quarter, including singer Kendrick Lamar’s Cortez Kenny III line of shoes. Nike said its new products in the past 3 months - Air Max 270, VaporMax and Epic React - are already the top 3 selling women’s athletic footwear models above $125. Sales in the North America rose 3.25 percent, easily beating analysts’ estimate of a 0.98 percent increase, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “They are probably gaining back some of (the) shelf space they lost,” Edward Jones analyst Brian Yarbrough said. Nike said it expects 2019 revenue to be in the high single-digit range, compared with its earlier forecast of mid-to-high single-digit growth. “I’m confident we’ll use this quarter as a catalyst for growth into fiscal ‘19 and beyond,” Chief Executive Officer Mark Parker said on a call with analysts. Nike said it expects gross margin to expand roughly 50 basis points or slightly greater in 2019, fueled by full-price sales and growth in its direct-to-customer business. Fourth-quarter gross margin had expanded 60 basis points to 44.7 percent. Net income rose to $1.14 billion, or 69 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended May 31, from $1.01 billion, or 60 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, the company earned 69 cents per share, beating estimates of 64 cents. Total revenue rose 12.8 percent to $9.79 billion, also topping estimates of $9.41 billion. The company, which has set a $50 billion revenue target for 2020, said fiscal 2018 sales rose 6 percent to $36.40 billion.

9.670225651571522," Adidas takes 12-10 lead over Nike in World Cup shirt deals BERLIN (Reuters) - Adidas ADSGn.DE can declare itself the winner over arch rival Nike NKE.N in the upcoming soccer World Cup even before the first match kicks off as it is kitting out the most teams. However, the German sportswear brand, which is also the official sponsor of the tournament, expects only a limited financial impact, partly because this year’s World Cup takes place in Russia, where the economy is in the doldrums. “The World Cup in Russia does carry lower financial opportunities than the similar event four years ago in Brazil,” Adidas Chief Executive Kasper Rorsted said earlier this month. “At the same time, we’re looking forward to it. It’s going to be a fantastic way of bringing our brand to life globally,” Rorsted added. Since the last tournament in 2014, Adidas has grown sales rapidly in areas other than soccer, capitalizing on booming demand for its retro basketball sneakers and springy Boost running shoes to outpace Nike, particularly in the U.S. market. Nevertheless, soccer remains important for the image of the German brand, which has supplied the World Cup match ball since 1970 and has a deal to sponsor the event until 2030. It also announced last week it will extend its partnership with the UEFA Champions League until 2021. After Nike kitted out more teams for the first time in Brazil in 2014, Adidas has fought back, this year sponsoring 12 of the 32 participating teams, including strong contenders like Germany and Spain, along with hosts Russia. Nike, which only got heavily involved in soccer when the World Cup was played in the United States in 1994, is supplying shirts for 10 countries, including Brazil, France and England. “The World Cup is such a powerful moment in sport, and we look forward to amplifying its energy,” Nike Chief Executive Mark Parker said in March. (For graphic on kit manufacturers throughout World Cup tournaments, click tmsnrt.rs/2JiAK6W) While team deals are important for sales of soccer jerseys, more critical for sales of boots is the sponsorship of top players, particularly the likes of Portugal’s Cristiano Ronaldo, who wears Nike, and Argentina’s Lionel Messi, in Adidas. Nike expects 60 percent of all the players heading to Russia will be wearing its boots, including almost half the German and Spanish team and three-quarters of the Russians, even though they will be wearing Adidas shirts. An exception is Iran, which faces new sanctions after U.S. President Donald Trump pulled out of an international nuclear deal. Nike says none of the country’s players are wearing its shoes, while Adidas is providing the team’s jerseys. A Nike spokesman said: “This has no relation to any political situation.” German brand Puma PUMG.DE is a distant third, sponsoring just four relatively lowly teams in the competition, compared with the eight it kitted out in 2014, dented by the failure of its top team Italy to qualify. Still, Puma Chief Executive Bjorn Gulden says the World Cup has helped its order book for the second and third quarters. Adidas reported soccer-related sales of 2.1 billion euros ($2.4 billion) in 2014, when it sold 14 million official match balls and 8 million jerseys, including 3 million for the winning German team. Sales rose to 2.5 billion euros by 2016, but slipped as a proportion of total Adidas revenue to 13.5 percent from 14.5 percent in 2014. It has not disclosed figures since then. Nike saw soccer sales fall a currency-adjusted 4 percent to $2 billion for its fiscal year ended May 31, 2017, accounting for less than 6 percent of group revenue. The World Cup could add about 3 to 4 percentage points to Adidas group revenue growth in 2018, lower than previous tournaments due to the fact it is happening in Russia, according to Piral Dadhania, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. However, Dadhania noted much of the benefit occurs before the event as the jerseys have already been sold to retailers. “Any incremental boost during or after the event relating to jersey sales depends on the extent to which specific teams progress through the competition,” Dadhania said."
14.436404983187112," Foot Locker tops forecasts as premium brands sell (Reuters) - Sneaker and sportswear specialist Foot Locker Inc FL.N beat Wall Street sales estimates by the most in at least two years on Friday, citing strong demand for premium products from its top vendors Nike Inc NKE.N and Adidas AG ADSGn.DE. First quarter profit at the retail chain also topped analysts’ consensus estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S, and shares in the company soared 16 percent in the first hour of trading in New York in response. Traditional U.S. retailers have been facing relentless pressure from a shift to online retailers like Amazon.com AMZN.O and a resulting drop in traffic at malls. For Foot Locker, a tie-up between the e-commerce giant and Nike launched last year has only added to those pressures. Industry research, however, shows sneaker sales, crucial to Foot Locker’s bottom line, rose 10 percent globally last year and a dog fight between Nike and Adidas has also seen the big brands spending heavily on U.S. sales and marketing. Sales at the chain’s stores open at least a year dipped 2.8 percent, but that fall was smaller than the decline of 3.6 percent analysts were expecting, according to research firm Consensus Metrix. Net sales at the New York-based retailer rose 1.2 percent to $2.03 billion, beating analysts’ expectations of $1.96 billion. “These strong results were led by branded assortments from Nike and Adidas as well as the resurgence of ‘90s influenced brands like Champion and Fila,” Chief Executive Officer Richard Johnson told a post-results call with analysts. Foot Locker has been revamping its own strategy by setting up stores outside malls, selling relevant and popular products quickly and striving to control inventory more tightly. The company singled out Nike’s Air Max 270, Max 2.0 and Nike Tuned Air as among its top selling brands and reiterated that it expected to return to growth of comparable store sales this year. That reflects a booming market in luxury sneakers that has drawn in high-end brands such as Kering's PRTP.PA Gucci, Prada 1913.HK and Balenciaga and seen price tags for limited editions soar. “The flow of premium product continues to improve, with increasing breadth and depth in the most sought after styles from our key vendors,” Johnson said. Analysts said the results bode well for Nike in particular. Telsey Advisory analyst Cristina Fernández said that new product flow from vendors could lead to positive comparable sales in the second quarter. The company’s income dipped to $165 million share in the quarter ended May 5, from $180 million, a year earlier. Excluding items, however, the company earned $1.45 per share, beating analysts’ average estimate by 20 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Foot Locker's shares were up 15.7 percent at $53.68 in morning trading, while peer sports good retailer Hibbett Sports Inc's HIBB.O shares fell 14 percent after posting quarterly results that missed estimates."
12.522576765336568," Nike, H&M and Burberry join forces for sustainable fashion LONDON (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Major global brands Nike, H&M, Burberry and Gap have signed up to an initiative that aims to improve the industry’s record on sustainability after a study found less than one percent of clothing is recycled. The Ellen MacArthur Foundation, set up by the record-breaking sailor, announced on Wednesday that the brands were joining its Make Fashion Circular scheme to reduce global waste from fashion by recycling raw materials and products. The head of the Make Fashion Circular initiative, Francois Souchet, said the aim was to create a “unstoppable momentum” towards an economy in which clothes are never seen as waste. “Over the past 15 years clothing production has doubled, while the amount of time we wear those clothes before throwing them away – usually to be landfilled or incinerated – has fallen dramatically,” Souchet told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. “We can change this ever faster model into one in which clothes are never seen as waste, through better design and new leasing and resale business models,” he said in an email. The four brands will join British designer Stella McCartney, who last year became the first to sign up to the initiative, which aims to eliminate waste and pollution and ensure products and materials are reused. At the time McCartney, a long-time advocate of sustainable fashion, said her industry was “incredibly wasteful and harmful to the environment”, urging other brands to join. In a report published in November, the Foundation exposed the scale of waste and pollution in the fashion industry, revealing that less than one percent of clothing is recycled. Half a million tonnes of plastic microfibres are released from washed clothing annually, equivalent to more than 50 billion plastic bottles, exacerbating ocean pollution, the report said. The participating brands will spend three years developing practical ways in which the industry can move away from polluting materials and processes, working with HSBC bank. “There is no single company that can solve the challenge of shifting the whole industry from a linear to a circular business model on its own, that is why a collaborative approach is crucial,” said H&M spokesman Iñigo Sáenz Maestre in an email. H&M has set a target of only using recycled or other sustainably sourced materials by 2030, he said, and 35 percent of its garments are currently produced that way."

18.026815318102514," Adidas sticks by Kanye West after slavery, Trump remarks BERLIN (Reuters) - Adidas ADSGn.DE remains committed to the Yeezy brand created by rapper Kanye West despite his comments describing slavery as a choice and praising U.S. President Donald Trump, the sportswear company said on Thursday. Adidas agreed in 2016 to expand its partnership with West, including opening new stores, after it poached the singer-turned-designer from Nike NKE.N in 2013, helping the German brand recover in the U.S. market in recent years. However, Adidas faced a call this week from the Care2 petition site to drop the artist after an interview in which he seemed to suggest that 400 years of slavery had been a choice, and also praised Trump for doing the “impossible”. “It is clear there are some remarks that we don’t support,” Chief Executive Kasper Rorsted told a conference call for journalists, but added: “We are very committed to the Yeezy brand moving forward.” Rorsted said the partnership was very important for the brand, although it had minimal impact on sales as most Yeezy products are released in limited quantities to generate hype. Rorsted made the comments after Adidas reported better-than-expected first-quarter net profit, as it outperformed rivals Nike and Under Armour UAA.N in North America. Adidas shares, up 13 percent in the last three months after it announced a big share buyback in March, were down 1 percent at 0857 GMT, with traders expressing concern about the West partnership and slower growth in Europe. Sales rose 21 percent in North America, and 26 percent in greater China, but only 5 percent in western Europe and fell 16 percent in Russia, where Rorsted said he saw little prospect for a recovery while sanctions continue. Nike reported a 6 percent drop in sales in North America in the quarter to Feb. 28, while Under Armour saw flat sales in the region in the first three months of the year. Adidas said ecommerce sales growth slowed to 27 percent, which Rorsted said was due to fewer product launches in the quarter. Net profit rose 17 percent to 542 million euros ($650 million), ahead analysts average forecast of 510 million euros as higher prices helped offset currency headwinds and an increase in marketing spending. Rorsted also highlighted gross margin improvements at struggling fitness brand Reebok, which saw sales return to growth in North America for the first time in years. Unlike German rival Puma PUMG.DE, Rorsted said he was not too concerned about the prospect of U.S. tariffs on footwear made in China, noting Adidas sources most of its shoes from Vietnam, with Chinese factories mainly producing for the domestic market.
