44.54773755830054," Trian pushes Invesco, Janus Henderson to consider deals-filings BOSTON (Reuters) - Activist investor Trian Fund Management LP said on Friday that it owns large stakes in Invesco Ltd and Janus Henderson Group Plc and plans to encourage the asset managers to consider strategic options like a merger as the industry faces a wave of consolidation. Trian said in a regulatory filing that it owns 9.9% stakes in both Atlanta-headquartered Invesco and Denver-headquartered Janus Henderson and has spoken with both firms. The news that Trian, which has a history of investing in asset management firms, is pushing for changes at the two prominent U.S. firms lifted stock prices in pre-market trading on Friday. Invesco’s shares were up 5.78% while Janus Henderson’s shares were up 6.48%. Reuters reported news of the new stakes on Thursday and representatives for the companies said on Thursday that each company was committed to delivering value for shareholders. Friday’s filing had more details, including that Trian has asked for two board seats for its co-founders Nelson Peltz and Ed Garden at Invesco. The filing said Trian has held “constructive” discussion with Invesco’s chief executive officer Martin Flanagan and chief financial officer Allison Dukes. At Janus Henderson, Trian has spoken with non-executive chairman Richard Gillingwater and intends to speak with the board and management about strategic and operational initiatives, the filing said. It is unusual for an activist to take two stakes in companies in the same business at the same time and push for consolidation, industry lawyers said. But Trian has experience in asset management industry consolidation having sat on the board of Legg Mason which was purchased by rival Franklin Resources earlier this year. Smaller players are struggling to stay relevant with giants like Vanguard and BlackRock controlling the bulk of the industry’s assets at a time investors are preferring passive index funds to more expensive actively managed portfolios."
44.54773755830054," Trian Fund Management takes 9.9% stakes in Invesco, Janus Henderson (Reuters) - Activist investment firm Trian Fund Management LP has taken a 9.9% stake each in asset management firms Invesco Ltd and Janus Henderson Group Plc, totaling about $900 million, people familiar with the matter said. Trian, founded by Nelson Peltz, Ed Garden and Peter May, has experience in pushing for better returns at asset management companies at a time when many of the smaller players are struggling to stay relevant with giants like Vanguard and BlackRock controlling the bulk of the industry’s assets. The Wall Street Journal first reported the stakes and said they were funded with capital from a long-term portfolio that Trian has built to help facilitate consolidation in the asset management industry. Representatives for Invesco and Janus Henderson said each company was committed to delivering value for shareholders. A Janus Henderson spokesman said the firm was informed about the Trian stake on Thursday and that it continues to “make significant progress to increase profitability, drive organic growth, and identify and deliver cost savings.” An Invesco spokeswoman said: “We continuously evaluate opportunities to further strengthen our ability to meet client needs and enhance long-term shareholder value.” Trian could not be reached for comment. The asset management industry has been shaped by a recent wave of consolidation as investors prefer to put money into cheaper index funds instead of more expensive actively managed portfolios. Earlier this year, Franklin Resources , known for its Franklin Income Fund, bought rival Legg Mason, where Trian had invested for the second time in early 2019. Invesco bought OppenheimerFunds last year. Trian often wins board seats at its target companies and had seats on the Legg Mason board. It has previously owned stakes in Bank of New York Mellon and State Street and recently announced a stake in cable giant Comcast Corp, saying its stock was undervalued."

Invesco this week called the Nasdaq’s sharp decline a “healthy period of consolidation” while fund manager Lord Abbett said U.S. stock valuations are likely merited, based on an analysis of companies’ earnings. On Sept. 4, Goldman Sachs reiterated its year-end price target of 3,600 on the S&P 500, roughly 6% above the index’s close on Wednesday, while UBS Global Wealth Management recommended clients “ease into the markets” rather than stay on the sidelines. Their optimism highlights how the Federal Reserve’s pledge to keep interest rates at record lows and hopes of a breakthrough in a vaccine for COVID-19 have underpinned market gains this year, though many remain wary that the U.S. presidential election and massive options bets on tech-related stocks could exacerbate market swings in the remaining months of 2020. “What we think we are going through is a healthy correction, removing the froth,” said Troy Gayeski, co-chief investment officer of SkyBridge, an alternative investments firm. “We certainly could fall more. But if you’re a tech investor you had to understand that the valuations were very high.” The Nasdaq posted its best day since April on Wednesday, a day after falling into correction territory, commonly defined as a fall of 10% or more from a recent peak. The other major indexes also rebounded on Wednesday after steep declines. “I think of this rout not so much as a correction, but as a digestion,” Kristina Hooper, Invesco’s chief global market strategist, said in a recent note. Second-quarter reported earnings on the S&P 500 were 23.1% above expectations, far above the trailing five-year average of 4.7%, analysts at Lord Abbett said in a recent note. “Earnings momentum, and the magnitude of analyst earnings revisions, is outpacing that in other markets, suggesting that higher valuations on U.S. equities are merited,” the report said. Still, some believe more volatility is in store. A recent poll of investors from UBS Global Wealth Management showed 65% viewed politics as their top concern, with the Nov. 3 U.S. presidential election just weeks away. Prominent investor Stanley Druckenmiller - a skeptic of this year's rally - again sounded a bearish note on Wednesday, warning on CNBC here that the stock market is in a mania fueled by the Federal Reserve. Uncertainty over huge options purchases by SoftBank Group Corp also hung over markets, creating another risk. Gayeski, of Skybridge, said he could see an opportunity to increase equity risk if there was a sharper drop, such as the Nasdaq falling 20% or the S&P 500 declining 15% from their respective highs and there were other supportive signs for the market such as the Fed’s expanding its balance sheet further. Any selling that spreads beyond the big tech-related stocks that have led markets higher could be an indication that the pullback may be extending further, said Willie Delwiche, an investment strategist at Baird. In the coming days, Delwiche is looking for signs of increasing investor caution -- such as buying of put options, outflows from equity funds and diminishing bullish views in surveys -- that indicate any over-exuberance has waned. Another indicator is how investors respond to key technical support levels, said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist for Truist/SunTrust Advisory. The Nasdaq, for example, on Tuesday closed below its 50-day moving average for the first time since April, but was back above it on Wednesday. “If you see these markets just slice through support levels, that’s a sign that the sellers have the upper hand,” Lerner said.

61.60217669810968," Invesco fund manager Barnett to leave after 24 years LONDON (Reuters) - Invesco Ltd IVZ.N said money manager Mark Barnett would leave the company after 24 years, ending a tough couple of years in which clients pulled billions from his funds. Barnett was impacted by the high-profile collapse of former Invesco colleague Neil Woodford’s firm, after it turned the spotlight on their shared and long-standing p, actice of holding relatively large positions in illiquid assets, which may be hard to sell quickly. Woodford ultimately chose to close his firm after his flagship fund was forced to suspend dealing having struggled to free up cash to pay back clients seeking to leave. It also prompted the regulator to take a closer look at the practice. Fund rating agency Morningstar cited the issue of illiquid holdings when downgrading Barnett’s Invesco High Income UK and Income UK funds in November, a move he rejected at the time, saying they were “appropriately positioned”. With many of Barnett’s listed holdings also performing poorly, hit in part by a period of underperformance for UK-focused companies, investors continued to pull their money. Invesco’s UK Strategic Income, High Income and Income funds had seen collective outflows of just over 2 billion pounds ($2.44 billion) in the year to September 2019. While Invesco appointed Martin Walker as co-head of UK equities alongside Barnett in November, it was not enough to stop him being dropped as manager by the Edinburgh Investment Trust EDIN.L in December, and last month by Perpetual Income and Growth Trust. After appointing Stephanie Butcher to the role of chief investment officer at the start of the year, Invesco announced in March plans to sell all of its unlisted equity holdings and reinvest the money in listed stocks. Invesco, which also announced a reorganisation of its UK Equity product portfolio, said on Friday that James Gladstone and Ciaran Mallon will be taking over as co-managers of the open-ended funds that Barnett was responsible for. “As we reorganise the UK Equities portfolio and after discussion with Mark Barnett, we have mutually concluded that this is the right time for him to hand over the leadership of these funds and leave Invesco,” Butcher said in a statement. “When I became CIO in January, I made it clear I would not shy from introducing change where I saw it necessary.” The Invesco UK Strategic Income Fund will also be merged with the Invesco Income Fund, according to the release. “Invesco clearly want to try and get their UK franchise back on the front foot, however it will take a long time for the new managers to turn around performance,” said Ryan Hughes, head of active portfolios at AJ Bell."
38.226421693007104," Goldman Sachs looks to buy private company holdings from Invesco: Sky News (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs GS.N is in talks to buy a large group of company stakes being sold by asset manager Invesco as it looks to shift illiquid holdings whose value has been hit by the COVID-19 disease outbreak, Sky News reported citing sources. The holdings are valued at several hundred million pounds, the report said here. A unit of Goldman Sachs Asset Management is close to buying the stakes, which include a holding in Oxford Nanopore, a gene sequencing specialist, according to the report. Some of the collection of private company holdings were assembled by Neil Woodford, whose flagship fund was winded down last year following a four-and-a-half month suspension, that marked a stunning reversal of fortune for one of Britain’s most high profile investors. Representatives at Goldman Sachs and Invesco declined to comment."

In a letter written to around 200 companies, the co-heads of UK equities, Mark Barnett and Martin Walker, said equity was “precious and expensive” and that companies should make use of government financing schemes first. “In these times of unprecedented uncertainty and volatility, we have analysed financial statements focussing on cash flow, liquidity and debt maturities in order to take a view on whether the company will be required to raise capital to strengthen its balance sheet and ensure its future viability,” they wrote. “However, current market valuations mean that equity is both precious and expensive and should the company be required to raise short term capital we would strongly advise you to examine any alternatives structures or facilities that may be available, for example, the COVID corporate financing facility (CCFF) or similar facilities.” A spokeswoman for Invesco confirmed the letter had been sent but declined to supply a copy to Reuters.

20.94635217714987," Invesco to sell all unquoted holdings in UK equities portfolios LONDON (Reuters) - Invesco said on Tuesday it would sell all the unquoted companies currently held in its UK equities portfolios and has marked down their value by 60% as a result of recent coronavirus-fueled market falls. The U.S.-based manager said it would reinvest the money in publicly listed companies, valuations of which have been hit hard in recent weeks as fears about a global recession gripped markets. “We recognize, of course, that a reallocation of capital from unquoted to publicly listed equity is a change in the fund composition,” it said in a statement on its website. “However, these are extraordinary times which call for decisive and positive action to look after the best interests of clients in the short and longer term.” The holding of unlisted or illiquid stocks in funds that allow daily access has faced criticism from investors, regulators and politicians in the UK after the high-profile collapse of Woodford Investment Management last year. Run by Neil Woodford, formerly a fund manager at Invesco, the firm’s flagship fund was suspended from trading amid a liquidity squeeze that ultimately resulted in his company collapsing. That put pressure on Invesco’s High Income and Income funds, which held some of the same stocks as Woodford. In response to news of the decision to sell out of unlisted stocks completely, Juliet Schooling Latter, research director at Chelsea Financial Services, said she considered the move “drastic”. “We understand Invesco’s wish to move away from these assets into more attractive parts of the market, but the amount of writedown is unjustified in our view,” she wrote in a note. “While there may be investor appetite for the funds to hold fewer unquoted stocks, I would doubt that investors would want this at the cost of a 5% drop in the value of their investments.”"

-16.627226453585674," Invesco appoints Martin Walker co-head of UK equities LONDON, Nov 29 (Reuters) - U.S. asset manager Invesco said on Friday it had appointed Martin Walker as co-head of UK equities alongside Mark Barnett, after a tough year marked by heavy outflows of client cash. Walker will take up his position on Jan. 1, after being asked to do so by Barnett, Invesco said in a statement. The move was first reported by Sky News. “Mark and Martin have worked together for 20 years; they have a strong working relationship and common understanding for how they want to continue to develop the team for the future,” Invesco said. Line management duties would be split between the pair, and both would continue to run their current portfolio of funds with no changes, it added. Barnett has come under the spotlight in recent months after a liquidity crisis forced the suspension and eventual closure of a fund managed by former Invesco manager Neil Woodford, who previously ran several of Barnett’s funds. In November, fund rating company Morningstar downgraded its assessment of Barnett’s funds, citing concerns over its large holdings of small and micro-cap stocks, which are less liquid than those of larger companies. In the year to end-September, Morningstar said Barnett’s UK Strategic Income, High Income and Income funds had seen collective outflows of just over 2 billion pounds ($2.57 billion), to leave their assets at 9.1 billion pounds."

13.435882839339644," Invesco thrives in China as former executive Ross leads Trump's trade war BOSTON (Reuters) - The former investment company of U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has been flourishing in China, even as he marshals billions of dollars’ worth of punishing tariffs in America’s deepening trade war. U.S. money manager Invesco Ltd IVZ.N - for which Ross was a senior executive from 2006 until he joined Trump's cabinet in February 2017 - has become the top foreign manager of Chinese money in China over the past year through its joint venture Invesco Great Wall Management, according to research firm Z-Ben Advisors, leaping ahead of Switzerland's UBS UBS.N. It is an unlikely success story that Invesco executives say has nothing to do with government policy, but is instead rooted in the company’s decades’ worth of relationships in China. Invesco maintains managerial control of its joint venture there, despite Chinese ownership limits. Last year the joint venture secured a lucrative 2018 listing on a huge Alibaba Group Holding Ltd BABA.N money market platform, where its fund has amassed $14.1 billion in assets. But American tariffs appear to have helped at least one Invesco steel investment in China, according to interviews and company disclosures. In late 2017, Invesco, through its private equity arm WL Ross & Co, took a lead role in restructuring bankrupt regional player Chongqing Iron & Steel 601005.SS with China Baowu Steel Group, also known as Baosteel. The recapitalization of Chongqing was completed in January 2018, just months before the Trump administration imposed 25% tariffs on Chinese steel imports. Chongqing reported a 71% increase in operating profit in 2018, according to company financial reports. The company said it benefited from reduced debt, Beijing’s mandate to remove excess capacity, and rising global steel prices amid Trump’s tariffs. Invesco and WL Ross & Co sold their equity stake in Chongqing in late 2018, realizing a 1.6 times return on investment in about 12 months, Invesco said. Four Rivers Investment Management, a joint venture led by WL Ross & Co and Baowu, China’s largest steel producer by volume, took a 23.5% stake in Chongqing after the restructuring. Invesco and WL Ross & Co were listed as stakeholders in the partnership when Chongqing filed its annual report on March 29. Four Rivers has up to $12 billion set aside for similar steel deals in China, according to Morgan Stanley analyst Rachel Zhang. She pointed out that given output limits, the only way for Chinese steel makers to grow is through mergers and acquisitions. Ross founded New York-based WL Ross & Co in 2000, and it has operated as a unit of Invesco since 2006. Ross sold his Invesco shares in December 2017. He said he mistakenly thought he had sold the stock earlier, as he was required to do. “I discovered that the previously held stock had not been sold. I then promptly sold these shares,” he wrote in a disclosure with U.S. government ethics officials. When asked in June about Wilbur Ross’ role in leading the United States’ trade war with China, Invesco chief executive Martin Flanagan acknowledged he was uncomfortable talking about his former colleague. He said he had not talked to Ross or Karen Dunn Kelley, Invesco’s former fixed-income chief, who now serves as Ross’ top lieutenant at Commerce, in more than 18 months. “We have mutually agreed to not spend time with one another just because of the potential perceived issue (of conflicts of interest),” Flanagan said. “I’m very sensitive about it and they are also.” Ross was not available for comment. Operating profit from Invesco’s joint venture in China rose 29% to $19.2 million in the second quarter from the previous three months, the company said on July 25. The company said the profit margin on the joint venture was more than 50%. Invesco Great Wall also reported $35.2 billion in average assets under management at the end of June, 58% higher than nine months earlier. The company’s overall Asia assets surged 13% to $118.6 billion during the first half of the year on net deposits from clients and market gains. But Invesco’s overall operating profit, including assets outside China, dropped 91% in the second quarter after taking charges related to its May acquisition of OppenheimerFunds from MassMutual. Although Invesco’s Chinese steel bet may have gotten a lift from the Trump trade war, Invesco’s executives say its winning play book in China took decades to write. The company first invested and managed money there in the early 1990s, and has raced ahead of BlackRock Inc BLK.N, Fidelity International, JPMorgan Chase & Co Inc JPM.N and Morgan Stanley MS.N, among others. Unlike most U.S. rivals, Invesco manages the joint venture with its Chinese partner, state-owned Huaneng Power International Inc 600011.SS. Each owns a 49% stake, but Invesco has management control. “This structure enabled Invesco to operate inside a board which was evenly held by the Chinese and Invesco,” said Peter Alexander, managing director of Z-Ben Advisors. “The elevation of the CEO – appointed by Invesco – to the board tipped the scales and with it all but allowed Invesco to run the (joint venture) essentially as a subsidiary.” Larger U.S. rivals typically do not manage the joint ventures they have with top-tier Chinese financial services companies. “We didn’t want to be part of a big bank or insurance company. We did not want to be overwhelmed and we wanted to be free of any conflicts,” Andrew Lo, the head of Invesco’s business in the Asia Pacific region, told Reuters in a telephone interview in July. “We wanted a relationship that allowed us to run the company and build the company from the start,” he said. Huaneng brought deep contacts in Chinese business and political circles, while Invesco delivered money management and investment expertise, Lo said. The world’s top banks and asset managers have been in China for years, too. But their joint ventures, and limited access to the mainland’s explosive wealth management market, have been a source of frustration. China is expected to end ownership limits for foreign investors in its financial sector in 2020, a year earlier than scheduled, to show the world it will keep opening up its markets, Premier Li Keqiang said last month. In June 2018, Invesco Great Wall also scored a coup when its Jingyi money fund was selected to be on the Yu'e Bao money-market platform. Yu'e Bao is an online spare cash management platform integrated with Ant Financial's Alipay, one of China’s largest digital payment platforms. It has more than 500 million users, according to Ant Financial, a unit of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd BABA.N. Invesco CEO Flanagan declined to say how the fund was picked to be on the platform, but said it was related to the company’s presence in China. “It’s literally decades of constant engagement and then you become an overnight success,” he said.
