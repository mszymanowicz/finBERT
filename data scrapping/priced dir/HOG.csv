48.093231199301165," Hero MotoCorp sets up separate unit to sell Harley motorcycles BENGALURU (Reuters) - India’s Hero MotoCorp has set up a separate business unit to sell Harley-Davidson vehicles in India, Hero said on Wednesday, months after the U.S. company ended most of its operations in the world’s largest motorcycle market. Hero has added 11 Harley-Davidson dealers in India and begun wholesale dispatches of Harley products to dealers from Jan. 18, the company said in a statement to Indian stock exchanges. Milwaukee-based Harley ended its sales and manufacturing operations in India in September after struggling for a decade to gain a foothold. A month later it entered a distribution deal with Hero, the world’s largest producer of motorcycles and scooters. Hero will also develop motorcycles to be sold under the Harley-Davidson brand as part of the deal. Hero on Wednesday also named Ravi Avalur, head of strategy and international business at engine components producer Cooper, as the head of its Harley business. He had previously headed the Indian unit of Italian motorcycle brand Ducati."
46.98009053828651," Harley Davidson adopts KKR executive-inspired employee stock program (Reuters) - Harley-Davidson Inc Chief Executive Jochen Zeitz said on Tuesday that the U.S. motorcycle maker would give stock grants to its employees, inspired by a program devised by KKR & Co Inc executive Pete Stavros. Zeitz said the move would make 4,500 employees of the Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based company more aligned with executives and shareholders. While KKR is not an investor in Harley-Davidson, he said he worked on the plan after meeting Stavros, who has been spearheading a similar initiative at his private equity firm. “We wanted to align our expectations with those of our shareholders and include our hourly and factory workers,” Zeitz, who took charge of the 118 year-old motorcycle company last year, said in an interview. About 20,000 non-management employees have been awarded more than $500 million worth of stock across eight industrial companies owned by KKR, including New Jersey-based drug capsule maker Capsugel and Ingersoll Rand Inc, a Denver-based producer of pumps and compressors. “In industrial firms the majority of the workforce tend to have low levels of income and low levels of engagement, but they are critical to your success,” said Stavros, who co-heads KKR’s private equity business in the Americas. Harley-Davidson unveiled the employee stock program as part of a 2021-2025 strategic plan to bolster earnings growth and profitability. Earlier on Tuesday, the company said its revenue fell 32% to $725 million in the fourth quarter, as motorcycle shipments almost halved. It also reported a net loss of $96 million, as retail motorcycle sales in the United States - the company’s biggest market - fell for the 16th straight quarter."
46.98009053828651," Harley unveils turnaround plan as shares nosedive on disappointing results CHICAGO (Reuters) - Harley-Davidson Inc’s shares plunged more than 20% on Tuesday after the motorcycle maker unexpectedly swung to a quarterly loss, overshadowing a new turnaround plan that targets low double-digit earnings growth through 2025. Since the middle of last year, the Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based company has shifted focus back to big bikes, traditional markets like the United States and Europe, and older and wealthier customers. Harley has trimmed its workforce and global dealer network, eliminated slow-selling models and exited markets where weak sales and profits do not justify investment. Chief Executive Jochen Zeitz, who took charge last year, is focused on enhancing Harley’s brand and has done away with promotional offers, tightened supplies and reduced inventory, enabling dealers to charge the sticker price for the company’s bikes. This more than halved dealer inventory last year and drove up prices for pre-owned bikes, which used to be a drag on new-bike sales. The leaner inventory as well as a switch in the introduction of new models to January from August, however, took a toll on the bike sales in the quarter through December. Fourth-quarter revenue dropped 39% versus a year earlier as motorcycle shipments almost halved, leading to a loss of 63 cents per share. Analysts surveyed by Refinitiv, on average, expected the company to report a profit of 14 cents a share. Harley’s shares, which had gained 38% since July when the company shared an earlier plan to reboot its business, fell as much as 22% on Tuesday morning and were still down 18.8% at $32.62 at midday. “Many investors had thought the turnaround plan was leading to better profitability faster than the plan the company laid out today,” said Brian Yarbrough, an analyst at EdwardJones. “While they are shrinking the business currently to drive more sustainable growth longer term, we continue to be concerned about lack of demand for Harley products longer term.” Retail sales in the United States - the company’s biggest market - fell for the 16th straight quarter, resulting in an 8 percentage-point decline in big-motorcycle market share. The decline comes at a time when motorcycle sales have gone up on the back of a demand for socially distanced recreational outdoor activity. Polaris Inc last week said retail sales of its Indian brand of motorcycles in North America were up more than 30% in the December quarter. In contrast, Harley’s sales in the region declined 15.4% year-on-year. Harley’s new leadership, however, remains steadfast in the strategy of keeping inventories tight as it prefers building desirability of the brand to expanding market share. “We are going to continue to manage inventory in line with demand,” Chief Commercial Officer Lawrence Hund told investors on an earnings call. As part of the five-year turnaround plan unveiled on Tuesday, the 118-year-old company would lean on combustion motorcycles to increase sales in touring, large cruiser and trike bike segments to achieve revenue growth in the mid-single digits. The company, which launched its first electric motorbike in 2019, will create a separate division focused on the development of electric vehicles. It also intends to make forays in premium low displacement bikes via partnerships. The latest turnaround strategy from the company, which has struggled for years to expand sales beyond baby boomers, comes after a decade-long effort to increase business overseas and draw younger riders with cheaper and newer models. Overall, Harley would invest between $190 million and $250 million a year over the next five years. It forecast a 5%-7% operating margin, or profit from sales, for 2021 on the back of a 20%-25% growth in motorcycle revenue."

The bonus will be 60% of each eligible employee’s 2020 bonus target, prorated per their joining, Harley said in a regulatory filing. “Employees will not receive any payments under any short-term incentive plan in respect of 2020 performance”, the company said. It temporarily reduced executive salaries during the year to better cope with the impacts of the coronavirus outbreak, according to its filing. In its latest quarterly results revealed in October, the company beat profit expectations as tighter inventories helped drive up prices. It also reined in costs as part of Chief Executive Officer Jochen Zeitz’s restructuring plan.

2.616531859715147," Dealers in India consider legal action against Harley Davidson NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Dealers in India for Harley-Davidson Inc HOG.N said on Tuesday they are exploring legal action against the iconic American motorcycle brand after it effectively exited the market as part of a broader restructuring plan. A number of dealers have hired leading Indian law firm AZB & Partners to review their paperwork with Harley-Davidson and suggest if there is a legal remedy, Rishi Aggarwal, a dealer for the motorcycle company, told reporters. “Harley has to compensate us for our losses. That is the only bone of contention. AZB is studying the case,” he said during a press conference organised by The Federation of Automobile Dealers Association (FADA) in India. Harley-Davidson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The U.S. company in September said it would discontinue its sales and manufacturing operations in India after a decade of struggling to gain a foothold. A month later it entered a distribution deal with India's Hero MotoCorp HROM.NS which will also develop motorcycles to be sold under the Harley-Davidson brand. India is one of the world’s largest motorbike and scooter markets but the bulk of sales come from low-end, commuter models. Harley-Davidson’s annual sales in the country halved to 2,470 motorcycles in the fiscal year to March 31 from 4,641 units five years earlier, industry data shows. General Motors (GM) GM.N, MAN Trucks and UM Motorcycles have also exited India in the last three years, creating uncertainty for dealers that typically invest millions of dollars to set up showrooms. FADA said it typically costs between 50 million and 80 million rupees ($673,682-$1 million) to set up a Harley-Davidson dealership. Compensation being offered by the company is around 10% of the investment, it estimates. “They have come back to us with some numbers but it is not even 10% of what we are looking for. It is peanuts,” said Arjun Bafna, who has been a Harley-Davidson dealer for 10 years."
17.686393348761687," Harley shines as CEO Zeitz's turnaround plan boosts profit (Reuters) - Harley-Davidson Inc beat profit expectations on Tuesday as tighter inventories helped drive up prices and it reined in costs as part of Chief Executive Officer Jochen Zeitz’s restructuring plan, sending its shares up as much as 28%. Overall shipments were down only 6% in the third quarter, recovering from a 59% slump in the prior quarter, indicating a rise in demand for the maker of large cruisers. The sharp recovery from the pandemic lows comes as CEO Zeitz looks to recharge the business by shifting the focus back to big bikes and traditional markets like the United States and Europe. Harley also tightened supplies and cut production, driving up prices for pre-owned bikes, which used to be a drag on new motorcycle sales. “We are managing inventory in line or rather a little short of demand,” Zeitz said. “Dealers are selling new bike at or very close to MSRP (manufacturer suggested retail price) and higher dealer profitability.” Global dealer inventory was down 30% in the quarter and Zeitz said the company was planning to exit 40 unprofitable markets. The company exited the world’s largest two-wheeler market, India, last month and recently announced a plan to develop and sell a range of premium motorcycles under its brand name in the country along with Hero MotoCorp. Retail sales in its biggest market, the United States, where Harley has not recorded a sales rise for the past six years, fell 10% from a year earlier, but was much less than the 27% slide in the second quarter. Total expenses fell 26% to $196.9 million in the quarter. Net income rose 38% to $120 million, or 78 cents per share in the third quarter ended Sept. 30. Analysts were expecting a profit of 21 cents per share, according to Refinitiv data. Motorcycles and related product revenue fell to $964 million from $1.07 billion a year earlier."

The Milwaukee-based company said on Thursday it will stop sales and shut its manufacturing plant in India, effectively abandoning the world’s biggest motorcycle market after a decade of unsuccessful efforts to gain a foothold. Harley however is in talks with Hero MotoCorp to enter into a distribution arrangement that will allow the Indian company to import and sell Harley bikes as its sole distributor, two sources with familiar with the talks said. “Hero will be the master distributor for Harley bikes in India ... This will be a partnership, a strategic alliance,” said one of the sources, all of whom declined to be named as the discussions were private. Discussions are also ongoing to let Hero become a contract manufacturer for at least one Harley motorcycle with 300-600 cc engine capacity, which it will launch later, the first source added. The financial details of the deal were not immediately clear. Asked about talks with Hero, a Harley spokeswoman said the company can’t comment on “rumours or speculation”. On Thursday, it said it was “changing its business model in India & evaluating options to continue to serve customers.” Hero MotoCorp, which is the India’s largest two-wheeler manufacturer by sales, said it doesn’t comment on market speculation. It produced 6.4 million two-wheeler scooters and motorcycle, a third of India’s total output.

60.73031974916394," Harley deepens restructuring with India exit (Reuters) - Harley-Davidson Inc HOG.N said on Thursday it would discontinue its sales and manufacturing operations in India, effectively abandoning the world's biggest motorcycle market after a decade of unsuccessful efforts to gain a foothold. Harley had spent recent months moving dealerships in the country to cheaper locations, and the announcement followed speculation in Indian media a month ago that executives had played down. The move involves $75 million in restructuring costs, some 70 redundancies and the closure of its Bawal plant, walking away from a market worth about 17 million bike and scooter sales a year. (bit.ly/3mPHZnx) It will retain only a scaled-down sales office in Gurgaon, south of New Delhi. The departure is also the latest setback for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s strategy to encourage domestic manufacturing that would keep more of the fruits of a gigantic home consumer market in India. Harley has been scrambling for years to grow sales beyond baby boomers in the United States and has not posted retail sales growth there in the past 14 quarters. Chief Executive Officer Jochen Zeitz, who took the reins at the company in February, unveiled a major “Rewire” in July to boost profits by reducing Harley’s product portfolio by 30% and investing in 50 markets with growth potential in North America, Europe and parts of Asia Pacific. India was one of the markets the company at that point committed to investing in more heavily. Thursday’s statement said the move to leave had been pushed through since Aug. 6. Harley said it now expects total restructuring costs of about $169 million in 2020, but warned that the restructuring program - referred to internally as “The Rewire” - was likely to incur more charges. India, still far cheaper and poorer than many of the developing economies with which it competes for investment, has proven an inhospitable market for other auto industry players. Last year, Ford Motor Co F.N pared back its interests and ceased independent operations in India by entering into a joint venture with Indian automaker Mahindra & Mahindra MAHM.NS. General Motors GM.N, which stopped domestic sales in 2017, also plans to stop manufacturing and exports from India by the end of this year. Growth in domestic sales has slowed of late - with sales of cars and motorbikes falling 18% in the last fiscal year to March 31 from a year ago."

35.5154750007716," U.S. judge approves revised EPA Harley-Davidson emissions settlement WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. judge late on Monday approved a revised settlement with Harley-Davidson Inc over excess emissions that dropped a requirement that it spend $3 million to reduce air pollution. In August 2016, the Milwaukee-based motorcycle manufacturer agreed to pay a $12 million civil fine and stop selling illegal after-market devices that caused its vehicles to emit too much pollution. It also agreed to spend about $3 million to retrofit or replace wood-burning appliances with cleaner stoves to offset excess emissions. The Justice Department in July 2017 cited a new policy by then-U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions and an ongoing review of the penalty by a government auditor in proposing to drop the $3 million mitigation project. More than four years after the settlement was announced, U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan approved the settlement over the objections of environmental groups and a group of 10 states, including New York, Illinois, Maryland, Vermont, Washington and Massachusetts. While the earlier agreement “containing the mitigation project might have been the ‘best’ resolution of Harley-Davidson’s alleged violations, the court cannot say that the decree lodged before the Court is not within ‘the reaches of the public interest,’” Sullivan wrote in approving the consent decree. Harley-Davidson and the EPA did not immediately comment Tuesday. The settlement resolved allegations that Harley sold about 340,000 “super tuners” enabling motorcycles since 2008 to pollute the air at levels greater than what the company certified. Harley-Davidson did not admit liability and has said it disagreed with the government, arguing that the tuners were designed and sold to be used in “competition only.” Even though the settlement had not yet taken effect, Harley-Davidson has said that since August 2016, it sold only tuners certified by the California Air Resources Board and halted sale of the tuners in question and destroyed tuners returned by dealers."

It also unveiled a restructuring strategy that aims to shift focus back to more profitable motorcycles and core markets such as the United States. Harley has been struggling for years to grow sales beyond baby boomers. The company has not posted retail sales growth in the United States, its biggest market, in the past 14 quarters. The pandemic has exacerbated its challenges. In the latest quarter, U.S. retail sales plunged 27% year-on-year, the steepest fall in at least six years. Overall, motorcycles revenue dived 53% year-on-year to $669 million, hurt by the temporary suspension of production due to COVID-19 related lockdowns. Harley reported a loss of 60 cents per share for the quarter through June, compared with a profit of $1.23 per share a year ago. Analysts on average expected a profit of 4 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Shares were last trading down 7.7% at $27.01. While retail sales have improved sequentially since April with the lifting of pandemic shutdowns, Harley declined to provide an earnings guidance. Chief Executive Jochen Zeitz has tightened supplies and cut production, reducing global dealer inventory and driving up prices for pre-owned bikes, which used to be a drag on new bike sales. Zeitz, who took the reins in February, said the company will avoid price discounts and promotions to drive sales. “Focusing on desirability will be the future,” he said. The move could make it tougher to find new customers in the worst recession since the Great Depression. As part of the restructuring strategy, Zeitz plans to reduce product portfolio by 30% and invest in 50 markets with growth potential in North America, Europe and parts of Asia Pacific. His strategy will eliminate 700 positions, but is estimated to result in ongoing annual savings of about $100 million."

As part of the overhaul, Chief Financial Officer John Olin will leave the company effective immediately. Darrell Thomas, treasurer, will become interim chief financial officer, it said. Harley-Davidson’s sales have been declining for the past five years in the United States, its largest market, as its baby-boomer customer base ages. The economic pain caused by the coronavirus pandemic has further dented retail demand. In response to weak sales, the Milwaukee-based company has cut production, leading to 140 job cuts last month at its factories in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The latest cuts are in addition to those layoffs, a company spokeswoman said. Zeitz, who took over in February, is hailed for turning around the Puma brand’s near-bankrupt business. His restructuring strategy, dubbed The Rewire, is aimed at making Harley a leaner and more nimble organization. It seeks to reset product lines, focus on the company’s core strengths and prioritize profitable markets. “Significant changes are necessary, and we must move in new directions,” Zeitz said. Harley said the measures announced on Thursday will lay the foundation for a five-year strategic plan to revive sales that the company expects to share in the fourth quarter. In all, the restructuring will eliminate 700 positions globally. It will result in a $50 million restructuring charge in 2020, including $42 million in the second quarter. While the overhaul is expected to be completed by the end of the year, Harley said it will likely cause additional restructuring charges in 2021.

The layoffs will affect 90 production workers at the company’s facility in York, Pennsylvania, and 50 others at its Tomahawk facility in Wisconsin, a company representative told Reuters. Harley-Davidson’s sales have been declining for the past five years in the United States, its largest market, as its baby-boomer customer base ages.

Harley’s shares closed up 4.4% at $24.41. Production at the York and Tomahawk facilities resumed last month after the virus outbreak in the United States led the company to suspend the operations in mid-March. Harley’s decision to cut jobs reflects the challenges facing U.S. companies amid a slow and uneven economic recovery. While the economy has reopened, demand for industrial and consumer goods remains depressed. First-quarter U.S. retail sales at the Milwaukee-based company dropped 16% versus a year ago as the pandemic-induced lockdowns forced about half of its dealers to temporarily close their stores. Since then, easing restrictions have allowed the dealers to reopen. But retail sales are estimated to be down about 40% in the current quarter, according to a dealer survey published by Baird Equity Research on Wednesday. In response, Harley is trying to preserve cash and has resorted to cost cuts. It has slashed capital spending, frozen hiring, reduced salaries and eliminated merit increases for employees."

33.29776125587835," Harley boosts cash reserves as coronavirus hits demand (Reuters) - Harley-Davidson Inc HOG.N slashed its dividend and halted share buybacks on Tuesday to boost its cash reserves as global lockdowns due to the coronavirus pandemic hit motorcycle demand in the first quarter. The company has $1.47 billion in cash and is in talks with big U.S. banks to get $1.30 billion in loan to ride out the crisis, it said, adding it would focus on its core U.S. market to prop up sales. Harley shares, which have lost nearly half of its value so far this year, jumped as much as 17% in morning trading after the company rolled out its cash preservation plan. “Harley continues to struggle with declining sales, but it continues to generate respectable free cash flow and we consider shares fairly valued at current levels,” said CFRA Research analyst Garrett Nelson. To boost sales, the company also said it will “de-emphasize” on some unprofitable international regions. The shift in strategy for the company that symbolized the counterculture movement of the 1960s comes as it struggles to woo the next generation of younger riders with its electric and more nimbler bikes in the United States. Sales have been declining for the past five years in its largest market as its baby-boomer fan base ages. To make matters worse, the pandemic has further dented demand as Americans stay at home to curb the spread of COVID-19. “We are at critical time in our history that requires significant changes to the company,” said acting Chief Executive Officer Jochen Zeitz, who took helm in February and is best known for turning around the Puma brand. Zeitz’s plan to move the launch of new models to early part of the first quarter from August to better align with the start of the riding season helped U.S. retail sales in the first 10 week of the quarter to rise 6.6%. But as the quarter drew to a close, overall sales fell 15.5% in the United States, taking a hit from the lockdowns. Retail sales fell 20.7% internationally. Zeitz said Harley will expand its lineup of profitable motorcycles, while also focusing on selling new products such as adventure touring, sport bike Streetfighter and electric motorcycles. Harley cut its quarterly dividend to 2 cents from 38 cents. Earlier this month, it pulled its 2020 profit forecast and decided to temporarily lay off most of its global production employees to reduce costs. Motorcycles and related products revenue fell 8% to $1.10 billion in the quarter ended March 29. On an adjusted basis, it earned 51 cents, beating expectations of 41 cents, according to Refinitiv data."

56.784605535942234," Harley-Davidson lays off staff, cuts salaries, amid coronavirus outbreak CHICAGO (Reuters) - Harley-Davidson Inc HOG.N said on Wednesday it had temporarily laid off most of its global production employees and implemented salary cuts in a bid to lower costs as the coronavirus pandemic has hurt its business. The announcement comes weeks after the motorcycle maker withdrew its earnings forecast for this year, saying pandemic-induced disruptions could dent its ability to supply and sell motorcycles. Harley’s shares were last trading down 5.7% at $18.25. With the pandemic hitting their revenues and drying up cash flows, companies of all sizes are trying to conserve cash and bolster liquidity. However, worries about the impact of the highly contagious virus, which causes a respiratory illness called COVID-19, on Harley’s business have prompted both Fitch and Moody’s to downgrade its credit ratings. Harley has yet to quantify the impact, but Fitch says the company could see a 25% decline in sales this year. Separately, Moody’s expects declining sales to undermine Harley’s liquidity position. At the end of 2019, the Milwaukee-based company had $2.6 billion in cash and committed credit facilities, which the rating agency says would marginally cover the $2.3 billion of debt that is due to mature in the coming twelve months at Harley’s financial arm. As part of the cost cuts, Harley said it would “significantly” reduce all non-essential spending. Its chief executive officer and board of directors will forgo their salaries, the company said, though it didn’t say for how long. Salaries of the executive leadership would be cut by 30%, while most other salaried employees would see a reduction of between 10%-20% in their paychecks. Outside the United States, it will take similar actions. Harley said salary reductions will be reassessed at the end of the second quarter. The company said it will also not hand out merit increases for 2020 and will freeze hiring."

32.76179529351828," Harley-Davidson settles board fight with investor Impala (Reuters) - Harley-Davidson Inc HOG.N said on Monday it settled a board fight with Impala Asset Management just days after the investor began pressing to replace two directors at America's oldest and best-known motorcycle maker. An independent director, mutually agreed on by Impala and Harley, will join the board after the company’s annual meeting, which was held in May last year, and before July 31. Impala, which owns roughly 2% of Harley’s stock, nominated two directors two weeks ago as the $2.8 billion hedge fund wanted the iconic American brand to return to its roots after focusing on electric motorcycles and concentrate on its core riders. It had criticized the company for losing market share and for being slow to fix poor returns. In January it pushed for the ouster of Chief Executive Matt Levatich. He resigned in February after five years as CEO during which the company lost more than half of its value. On Monday, the two sides cast aside some differences as the coronavirus outbreak makes it tougher for companies to stay in business and falling stock prices are hurting many investors. Harley and Impala entered the “agreement in the spirit of cooperation during trying times, viewing it as a necessity to move forward,” the company said in a regulatory filing. The $2.7 billion company’s stock fell 4.38% on Monday to $17.02, having tumbled some 50% since the start of the year. Two weeks ago Impala nominated former auto industry executive Brent Dewar and Leo Hindery, Jr., who has public board experience, as directors to Harley’s nine member board. Now neither will be considered for the board seat, according to the agreement. Impala will not be allowed to suggest someone working for the fund for the board seat. Impala is run by former Soros Fund Management Chief Investment Officer Robert Bishop. At the end of February Harley tapped long-time board member Jochen Zeitz as interim CEO but the investment fund has criticized his compensation package of as much as $8.5 million. Zeitz, a former CEO of German apparel and footwear maker Puma, has led a push for sustainability at Harley and was a force behind The Live Wire, the company’s first production of an electric bike.

-28.979611353748897," Harley-Davidson looks for new leadership to end its sales struggle (Reuters) - Harley-Davidson Inc HOG.N on Friday named a board member hailed for turning around the Puma brand's near-bankrupt business as its interim chief as the motorcycle maker gropes for an effective strategy to woo young customers and revive sales. Jochen Zeitz was asked to take over after Chief Executive Officer Matthew Levatich stepped down following the Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based company’s worst sales performance in at least 16 years. Harley-Davidson said Zeitz will serve as interim CEO until an external search firm helps find a new chief executive. Michael Uhlarik, founder of consultancy Motorcycle Global, said Levatich’s exit was expected. He said Harley was likely to give Zeitz a long run as he has “proven turnaround” skills. Zeitz is well known for transforming the loss-making Puma in the 1990s into one of the world’s top three sports brands. “It is not about the next quarter or earnings per share,” Uhlarik said. “They will have to build a long-term, multi-year strategy.” Harley has failed for years to increase sales in the United States, its top market, which accounts for more than half of its motorcycles sold. As its tattooed, baby-boomer consumer base ages, the Milwaukee-based company is finding it challenging to attract new customers. Levatich, who took the company’s reins in May 2015, bet on new launches, including of battery-powered bikes, to turn around the company’s fortunes in the domestic market. The results, however, remained elusive. Harley’s 2019 U.S. bike sales were the lowest in at least 16 years. Falling sales in the past 12 quarters have forced the company to limit production of its bikes to prevent price discount pressure and protect profit. In 2019, Harley’s bike shipment volume in the United States was the lowest in at least two decades. Global shipments were the lowest since 2010. With no sales revival in sight, investors were becoming restless. Since Levatich took the helm, Harley's shares have fallen 46%. By comparison, the S&P 500 Index .SPX has gained 40%. Falling sales have had made Wall Street speculate whether the company, which symbolized the counterculture movement of the 1960s, would seek refuge in a buyout or turn private to rework its product lines and branding without the pressure from shareholders to shield its profit margins. Last month, Levatich tried to parry that question by expressing confidence in the current strategy. But he also acknowledged that the challenges facing Harley were “significant” as its heavy and expensive bikes were competing for “people’s scarce time, people’s scarce funding and commitment.” Levatich will assist with the transition through the end of March, the company said. On Friday, Harley’s shares closed down 2.2% at $30.47."

-34.574724820060965," Harley-Davidson's sales growth struggle sends shares tumbling CHICAGO (Reuters) - Harley-Davidson Inc HOG.N on Tuesday reported a decline in quarterly motorcycle revenue that outpaced Wall Street's estimates as retail sales in the United States dived again, sending its shares lower. Motorcycle revenue fell an annual 8.5% to $874.1 million in the December quarter, faster than a 3.4% fall predicted by analysts in a Refinitiv survey. Its shares, after falling as much as 7%, pared losses to trade 2.5% lower at $33.96 on Tuesday afternoon. Harley has for years failed to increase sales in the United States, its top market, which accounts for more than half of its motorcycles sold. As its tattooed, baby-boomer base ages, the Milwaukee-based company is finding it challenging to woo new customers. Its bike sales in America last year were the lowest in at least 16 years. Falling sales in the past 12 quarters have forced the company to tighten the supply of its bikes to prevent price discount pressure and protect profit. In 2019, the shipment volume of its bikes in the United States was the lowest in at least two decades. Global shipments were the lowest since 2010. In a reflection of the demographic headwind, the motorcycle maker's stock price has declined by 44% in the past five years. By comparison, the S&P 500 Index .SPX has gained 63%. Chief Executive Matthew Levatich is betting on building riders and new launches including battery-powered bikes to turn around the company’s fortunes in the domestic market. The results have been elusive thus far. U.S. sales are forecast to fall again this year. Levatich told analysts the challenges were “significant” as Harley’s heavy and expensive bikes were competing for “people’s scarce time, people’s scarce funding and commitment.” Harley’s prolonged sales struggle at a time when the U.S. economy is having its longest expansion in history is fueling speculation over the company’s possible alternatives, including a potential sale of the company to help preserve its brand and maximize shareholder value. On Tuesday, Levatich tried to parry that question by expressing confidence in the current strategy which includes expanding its business overseas, particularly in Asia, to account for half of revenue by 2027. The company’s Asia-Pacific sales rose 2.7% in 2019, led by improved demand in Southeast Asia and China. The company also plans to launch a new small displacement motorcycle in China later this year. Similarly, Levatich hopes to lift sales in Europe with the launch of new middleweight bikes. The European Union’s permission to let Harley ship bikes from its facility in Thailand, sidestepping the trading bloc’s 25% retaliatory tariffs on U.S.-built motorcycles, is also expected to provide a fillip to sales in the region this year. Motorcycle revenue in 2020 is expected to be about $4.53 billion to $4.66 billion compared with $4.57 billion last year. Operating margins are projected to improve by at least 70 basis points, helped by lower tariff bill and higher savings."

-27.39786903572272," Garuda Indonesia suspends directors linked to Harley Davidson smuggling: commissioner JAKARTA (Reuters) - Flag carrier PT Garuda Indonesia GIAA.JK is suspending directors linked to the alleged smuggling of a Harley Davidson motorbike by its chief executive, the company's chief commissioner said on Saturday. Indonesia’s State-Owned Enterprises Minister Erick Thohir on Thursday said he will fire CEO Ari Askhara for allegedly trying to evade tax by bringing into the country a Harley Davidson motorbike onboard a new plane from France. Askhara has been suspended pending a shareholders’ meeting due in coming weeks to determine his fate. Thohir said the smuggling also involved at least one other Garuda employee based in Europe who helped transfer the payment and assisted in the delivery of the motorbike. He said the investigation will continue to ascertain whether more employees were involved. Sahala Lumban Gaol, chief commissioner of Garuda, said in a televised press conference on Saturday that members of the board of directors who were “indicated to have been involved directly or indirectly” in the incident have been suspended. He declined to disclose the names of the suspended directors or say how many were affected. Askhara has not responded publicly to the accusations of smuggling.

-11.293165947165651," Harley-Davidson beats forecasts as international sales rebound (Reuters) - Harley-Davidson Inc HOG.N beat expectations for profit on Tuesday and stuck to its full-year shipment forecast, allaying fears of another major hit from European import tariffs and a further slump in sales in its main U.S. market. Shares of the company rose as much as 8.8% to $40.36, as it posted the first rise in international sales in a year during the third quarter and a 3.6% dip in U.S. retail motorcycle sales - the smallest decline in nearly three years. Profits continued to sink - by 24% - but the results offered some hope that one of the biggest names in motorcycles was finally beginning to arrest a slide in global sales that it has been fighting for years. Sales in the world’s biggest motorcycle markets in Asia, which Harley has targeted with smaller bikes that go against its traditional profile, rose 8.7% in the quarter and are up about 1.6% this year overall. The company plans to source half of its revenue from overseas by 2027 and international retail sales rose 2.7% to 23,619 motorcycle in the quarter. While worldwide shipments fell 5.8% to 45,837 motorcycles, they topped analysts’ estimates by over 1,000 motorcycles, and the Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based company stuck to its 2019 shipment target of 212,000 to 217,000 bikes. “As we look to the remainder of 2019, we are encouraged by the momentum of retail sales trends through the first nine months of this year but also recognize substantial headwinds that we continue to face,” Chief Financial Officer John Olin said. The company is also cutting spending and said it now expects 2019 capital expenses of $205 million to $225 million, about $20 million less than its previous estimates. Excluding items, the company earned 70 cents per share, beating Wall Street expectations of 52 cents while revenue from motorcycles and related products overall fell 4.9% to $1.07 billion. The company, which has been criticized by President Donald Trump for its plan to shift some U.S. production overseas, has also been battling the effects of trade tensions on its business globally. Harley said on Tuesday retaliatory import duties imposed by the European Union and China on its bikes would cost the company about $105 million in 2019, up from its prior estimate of $100, with about $90 million of the hit coming from EU tariffs. Brussels in June raised import duties on U.S.-manufactured Harley bikes to 31% from 6%, and the company said the impact from tariffs more than doubled in the third quarter from a year ago to $21.6 million. In response, Harley plans to begin shipping bikes from its Thailand plant but a delay in regulatory approval from the trading bloc means it will not see any benefit in earnings before the second quarter of 2020."

6.645075674779359," Harley struggles to fire up new generation of riders with electric bike debut CHICAGO (Reuters) - Harley-Davidson Inc HOG.N is betting on electric motorcycles to attract the next generation of younger and more environmentally conscious riders to reverse declining U.S. sales. But as Harley ships its first “LiveWire” bikes - priced at $29,799 - to dealers, there is little evidence the 116-year-old brand is catching on with new young customers. The problem lies mostly with this “super-premium” product’s price. The bike costs nearly as much as a Tesla Model 3, and aims for a market that does not really exist: young, “green” and affluent first-time motorcyclists. The sleek sport bike has been available for preorder in the United States since January. However, the bulk of the orders are coming in from existing and old riders, according to interviews with 40 of the 150 dealerships nationwide that are carrying the bike this year. The dealers Reuters spoke with account for little over a quarter of LiveWire dealerships and are spread across Wisconsin, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, California, Nevada, New Jersey and New York. Harley has for years failed to increase sales in the United States, its top market accounting for more than half of its motorcycles sold. As its tattooed, baby-boomer base ages, the Milwaukee-based company is finding it challenging to woo new customers. In 2018, Harley posted the steepest sales decline in four years in the United States. U.S. sales are tipped to fall again this year. (Graphic on Harley's U.S. Retail sales: ) The heavyweight motorcycle maker's stock price has declined by 42% in the past five years. By comparison, the S&P 500 Index .SPX has gained 47%. When Chief Executive Officer Matt Levatich announced LiveWire’s launch last year, his hope was the ease of riding motorcycles with no gears or clutch would help attract young and environmentally conscious urban riders. In an interview with Reuters in February 2018, Levatich said the bike would help address Harley’s demographic problem. “It is more about the next century than the last century,” he said at the time. The preorders, thus far, have belied those hopes, according to the dealers. “It is appealing to a demographic that is already riding,” said Gennaro Sepe, a sales manager at a Harley dealership in Chicago. His store has received four preorders for the bike. All of them are from existing riders. Harley declined to comment on LiveWire preorders. The motorcycle maker is not the only company investing in battery-powered transportation. Tougher emissions rules in Europe, China and the United States are forcing auto companies to switch to electrified models. A survey of U.S. millennial motorcyclists, published in February by the Motorcycle Industry Council, found 69% of the riders interested in electric motorcycles. Harley’s dealers said they are getting inquiries from young customers, but are struggling to translate them into sales. A key reason: LiveWire’s retail price. “Interest is very high,” said a sales manager at a New Jersey-based dealership, who declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak to media. “But once you get to pricing, interest is thrown out of the window.” Over half of young college graduates in America, whom Harley is courting with battery-powered bikes, are saddled with student loans that entail average repayment of $200 to $300 per month. Harley is not offering any discount or incentives to push the sales, either, the dealers said. In an interview with CNBC television in May, Levatich called LiveWire “one of the best engineered products on the market” and said it was worth its price. Gary Jon Prough, general sales manager at a dealership in Countryside, Illinois, said the vast majority of millennials cannot afford the bike as LiveWire is targeted at young and affluent customers with incomes above $100,000 a year. To drive up sales, Prough and other dealers expect Harley to go Tesla Inc's TSLA.O way: launch more affordable battery-powered vehicles after creating a buzz with the premium model. Tesla’s first electric car cost over $100,000, but prices came down with subsequent models. Its Model 3 now comes with a base price of $35,000 and was instrumental in lifting its vehicle deliveries to a record level in the latest quarter. Traditional Harley Davidson entry-level bikes cost about $6,900. The motorcycle maker has plans to bring out four more electrified models in the mid-power, low-power, e-bicycles and kids’ two-wheeler segments by 2022. But unlike Tesla, Harley does not enjoy the true first mover’s advantage. California-based Zero Motorcycles is already selling electric bikes in the United States with retail prices ranging from $8,500 to $21,000. Its top-end bike - SR/F - is similar to LiveWire, but costs nearly $9,000 less. Still, Bob Clark, a dealer for Zero’s bikes in Chicago, says he has not yet sold one SR/F to riders under the age of 35. All three electric bikes he sold to young riders this year were in the $10,000 price range. “Young riders are environmentally conscious, but are also very price-sensitive,” Clark said. It is not just pricing. LiveWire’s limited range is also hampering its sales. The bike can travel 146 miles (235 km) in the city or 95 miles in combined city and highway riding per charge. An ordinary household outlet can provide an overnight charge, while Level 3 direct current fast chargers stationed at Harley dealers will fully charge the bike in 60 minutes. This renders LiveWire less effective for longer-distance rides, limiting its appeal among rural riders who prefer touring bikes. Seven Harley dealerships told Reuters they have not even bothered ordering the bike, which would require investing in a Level 3 charging station and training staff. An Ohio-based dealer, who had initially signed up for LiveWire, said he pulled out at the last minute as he was not sure of the bike’s demand in his area. A delay in LiveWire’s arrival in stores has left the dealers in the Midwest and the East Coast with hardly a month to aggressively push the bike before the snow season sets in. Winter generally means a lull for motorcycle sales. When dealers began taking preorders, the delivery was expected in August, but was later shifted to September. On Sept. 30, the dealers Reuters spoke with were still waiting for the first bike. In a Twitter post on Oct. 2, Harley said the bikes are starting to arrive at authorized dealers. The tweet also carried a picture of the first LiveWire that was “rolled off the line” at its York, Pennsylvania, facility in late September. With the demand rather limited, the dealers said, Harley has decided to keep the supplies tight in order to protect the bike’s brand value and prevent any price-discounting pressure. The dealers said they are all expecting to receive less than 10 LiveWires this year. James Hardiman, an analyst at Wedbush Securities, reckons Harley would sell between 400 and 1,600 LiveWires in the first year. That is not even 1% of the 228,051 bikes it sold worldwide last year. “This is going to be largely a rounding error certainly this year and even next,” Hardiman said."

6.325708959847201," Harley Davidson to lay off 40 employees in Wisconsin CHICAGO (Reuters) - Harley-Davidson Inc has laid off 40 employees at its general merchandise division in Milwaukee as part of a restructuring exercise, according to a company official with knowledge of the matter. In an emailed response to Reuters, the motorcycle maker confirmed the layoffs but didn’t share the details. Harley said it was reorganizing the division to manage its business with “focus and discipline”. The merchandise division accounted for about 5% of the company’s revenues last year. However, sales have been falling since 2015. In the first half of this year, the unit reported a 4.2% year-on-year decline in revenues. Harley is battling weak demand in the United States, which accounts for more than half of its sales. Declining sales have forced the company to revise down its motorcycle shipment forecast for the year. The company official said the layoffs won’t impact any workers in its manufacturing division."
9.563725512981994," Sales to emerging markets a bright spot for Harley Davidson CHICAGO (Reuters) - Harley-Davidson Inc HOG.N on Tuesday reported stronger sales in China and other Asian markets and said U.S. sales should improve in the second half of the year, positive news that offset a cut to its full-year motorcycle forecast and sent shares up 5.3 percent. “There’s a general sense of relief that the company’s earnings are expected to hold up fairly well despite lower motorcycle sales volume and operating margin guidance,” said Garrett Nelson, a senior equity analyst at CFRA. Harley’s challenges in the United States, which accounts for more than half of the company’s sales, are well documented - core customers are growing older and outreach efforts to attract new and young riders have yet to show results. In a reflection of the demographic headwind, the heavyweight motorcycle maker’s stock price has declined by 46% in the past five years. In comparison, the S&P 500 has gained 50%. To offset weak demand at home, Chief Executive Officer Matt Levatich is trying to make deeper inroads into some of the fastest growing two-wheeler markets in Asia through lightweight motorcycles. The push is part of a strategy to get half of the company’s revenue from overseas by 2027. The latest results show those efforts are bearing fruit. While retail motorcycle sales were down in the developed markets, they were up in emerging markets on the back of a double-digit growth in China and ASEAN markets. Levatich credited the performance to the company’s decision to set up a plant in Thailand to serve the Southeast Asian market as well as China. The decision had drawn flak from both U.S. President Donald Trump as well as Harley’s labor unions. The move, however, has allowed the American icon to circumvent the region’s tariff barriers and price its bikes more competitively, resulting in a 77% jump in sales in Southeast Asia during the June quarter. In the United States, sales fell again. But in a silver lining for the company, sales in the age group of 18-34 year-olds were up 2.7 percentage points. Harley has been aggressively wooing the next generation of riders to turn around its fortunes. Its first electric motorcycle, LiveWire, scheduled to go on sale in September, is targeted at younger people who don’t prefer big motorcycles. U.S. sales are forecast to be down in the second half of the year. The pace of decline, however, is expected to moderate. The Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based company now expects to ship about 212,000 to 217,000 bikes in 2019, 5,000 units fewer than projected earlier. The estimate of operating margin as a percent of motorcycle revenue for 2019 has also been revised down by 2 percentage points. “We expected 2019 to be a difficult year and it is unfolding as such, especially in our developed international markets,” Chief Financial Officer John Olin told analysts on an earnings call. Adding to the company’s troubles is Trump’s trade war. In retaliation for the tariffs the White House placed on imported steel and aluminum, the European Union increased import duties on U.S.-manufactured Harley bikes to 31% from 6% last June. To mitigate the EU tariffs, Harley will begin shipping bikes from its Thailand facility. However, a delay in regulatory approval from the trading bloc means the benefits of lower tariffs would not reflect in earnings before the second quarter of 2020. In the June quarter, Harley’s profits declined to $1.23 per share from $1.45 per share a year ago."

0.6862039601368752," Harley-Davidson strikes deal to build smaller bike in China (Reuters) - Harley-Davidson Inc will partner with China’s Qianjiang Motorcycle Co to build a new smaller motorcycle than its trademark “big hogs”, making good on promises to move more production outside the United States that have angered President Donald Trump. Trump last year threatened to impose higher taxes on Harley after it made plans to move production for European customers overseas, part of a longer-term strategy for dealing with lower sales in the U.S. and higher costs because of trade tariffs. The partnership Harley outlined on Wednesday is aimed both at taking a bigger chunk of China’s huge bike and moped market, while also fitting in with a plan to cut costs and source half of all sales outside the United States by 2027. The new bike would have an engine displacement of 338 cubic centimeters, one of the smallest in the company’s 116-year old history, and would be sold in China from the end of 2020. Harley’s existing range of motorcycles are generally far larger and come with high price tags and engine capacities of more than 601 cubic centimeters. That has made the company a niche seller in Asia’s big markets, where lightweight bikes and scooters dominate, and left it struggling to win over consumers globally to replace a traditional U.S. customer base which is aging. Harley declined to reveal a price range for the new motorbike, but Qianjiang said it would be “affordable” and Harley said it would be introduced elsewhere in Asia after the initial launch in China. “The international motorcycle market is huge, but Harley-Davidson has not been able to penetrate it with large/expensive bikes,” said Craig Kennison, an analyst with brokerage Baird. “Our recent dealer survey work reinforces the need for Harley-Davidson to add more first-time riders. For many, affordability is an issue.” Harley’s sales in China grew 27 percent in 2018 compared to 2017, and the company has already boosted investment at its Thailand plant to serve that market and avoid additional import duty. Harley said it had picked Qianjiang, owned by Chinese Volvo brand operator Geely, based on its experience developing upscale smaller motorcycles, supply base and knowledge of emerging markets. The company said in 2018 that it planned to launch lightweight motorcycles in Asia and electric bikes globally. It expects to launch its first electric motorcycle without the traditional clutch and gear-shift controls later this year. As part of a plan it calls “More Roads to Harley-Davidson”, the company expects to spend $675 million-$825 million over the next four years, cutting costs and generating $5.9 billion-$6.4 billion in revenue in 2022."

The company said the new bike would have an engine displacement of 338 cubic centimeters, one of the smallest-powered engine bikes Harley has made and would be sold in China starting at the end of 2020. President Trump last year threatened Harley with higher taxes in response to its plans to move production for European customers overseas, part of the company’s strategy for dealing with falling sales in its home market and increased costs due to higher trade tariffs. Most Harley motorcycles sold in the U.S. are far larger, with engine capacities of more than 601 cubic centimeters. The new model will initially be sold in China, one of the world’s largest motorcycle markets, before it is introduced to other Asian markets. Harley-Davidson said it picked Qianjiang as a partner based on its experience developing premium small displacement motorcycles, supply base and the knowledge of emerging markets. Qianjiang is majority-controlled by Geely, a Chinese company that owns the Volvo brand of cars. The 116-year-old Milwaukee-based company, known for its heavy touring motorcycles, is trying to boost overseas sales and scrambling to revamp operations as its mainstay customer base ages.

-5.221114057208349," Harley-Davidson points to tariff impact as Trump weighs in (Reuters) - Harley-Davidson Inc stuck with a cautious outlook for 2019 on Tuesday that indicated its struggles with long-term competitive problems even as President Trump changed tune on the company, promising to stand up for it in global trade talks. Shares in the Milwaukee-based firm, buffeted by Trump’s rows with Europe and China over tariffs, surged as much as 4 percent after the president called the European Union’s treatment of the company “unfair” and vowed to reciprocate. The company also posted profit for the first quarter that was more than 30 cents per share ahead of expectations, but reported continuing declines in sales that analysts said did not change an overall difficult picture for Harley. Harley’s shares, which have suffered from the company’s struggle in the past decade to attract younger fans as core customers won on the back of its 1960s and 70s heyday grow older, were flat by mid-morning. “We remain cautious in our outlook for the U.S. motorcycle industry, and continue to rate the shares Hold,” Stifel analyst Drew Crum said. Trump had previously criticized Harley for its plans to shift some U.S. production overseas to avoid European Union duties imposed in retaliation for the tariffs the White House placed on imported steel and aluminum last year. EU tariffs on U.S.-manufactured motorcycles, which increased to 31 percent from 6 percent last June, are set to rise to 56 percent in 2021. Harley said retaliatory import duties, mainly comprising those imposed by EU, will cost the company between $100 million and $120 million in 2019. Similarly, China’s tariffs on the bikes exported from the U.S. have increased to 55 percent from 30 percent as a result of the trade war between the world’s two biggest economies. “The big impact for us is the European Union tariffs. And nothing has changed since the European Union increased the import tariff from 6 percent to 31 percent last June,” Harley Chief Executive Officer Matthew Levatich said in an earnings call with analysts when asked about Trump’s tweet. Harley’s first-quarter shipments fell 8 percent to 58,891 motorcycles but exceeded a consensus market estimate of 54,420. Its full-year guidance of 217,000 to 222,000 also compared well with a consensus of 217,840, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Both of those consensus figures, however, had fallen sharply on Monday after brokerage UBS warned March sales had been weak and threatened 2019 shipments, flattering the official numbers. The previous annual consensus for 2019 last week stood at 222,150. Overall sales continued to fall. U.S. retail motorcycle sales, or sales by dealers to customers, fell 4.2 percent in the first quarter ended March. 31. European sales were down 2.1 percent. The company’s overall net income fell 26.7 percent to $127.9 million in the quarter, while revenue from motorcycles and related products fell 12.3 percent to $1.19 billion, roughly in line with forecasts. That generated earnings per share, excluding items, of 98 cents, compared with the average analyst estimate of 65 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv."
-5.221114057208349," Trump warms to Harley Davidson, says EU tariffs 'unfair' WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday appeared to reverse course on Harley Davidson Inc, saying European tariffs facing the motorcycle manufacturer were “unfair” and vowing to reciprocate, after urging a boycott of the company last year amid a steel spat. The Wisconsin-based company last year announced plans to move production of its motorcycles destined for the European Union to its overseas facilities from the United States to avoid EU tariffs imposed in response to Trump’s duties on steel and aluminum imports. Trump retaliated by calling for higher taxes, threatening to lure foreign motorcycles to the United States, and backing a boycott of the iconic American motorcycle maker. On Tuesday, Trump appeared more sympathetic, calling the EU tariffs “unfair” but giving no other details about any planned U.S. action in a tweet citing comments by a Fox Business Network host. “So unfair to U.S. We will Reciprocate!” Trump wrote. On Saturday, Trump is scheduled to travel to Wisconsin to hold a campaign rally as he seeks reelection in the 2020 presidential election. Representatives for the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on any planned actions, as both the EU and the United States prepared to launch larger trade talks.

The agreements in place at all of its Wisconsin operations also include a signing bonus, two separate variable incentive plans, pension enhancements for current employees and a retirement incentive. These agreements, ratified by the United Steelworkers (USW) and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers’ Lodge, cover more than 1,000 employees in the Milwaukee-area and Tomahawk. Earlier this month, the workers had rejected the motorcycle maker’s proposal for a five-year contract, citing non-financial issues such as temporary workers and job security."
-5.867413494433467," Harley-Davidson workers in Wisconsin reject new labor contract CHICAGO (Reuters) - Harley-Davidson Inc’s workers in Milwaukee and Tomahawk, Wisconsin, have rejected the motorcycle maker’s proposal for a five-year contract, their union said on Tuesday, citing non-financial issues such as temporary workers and job security. The current seven-year contract had been set to expire on April 1. But Harley and the United Steelworkers (USW) union, which represents more than 1,000 hourly employees at the two facilities, said they had agreed to extend the contract through April 14. The union is pressing the Milwaukee-based company to address issues related to temporary workers, job security, scheduling, and seniority and temporary workers rights. A USW official told Reuters the union wants to protect full-time workers from layoffs. While it is asking for a road map that would allow temporary workers to become full-time workers, it is opposed to the company using temporary workers to pull work away from full-time employees. Patricia Sweeney, corporate media relations manager at Harley, said a flexible workforce enables the company to staff efficiently during the peak motorcycle demand season, helping it manage its cost structure and remain competitive. “This enables us to effectively manage the seasonality of our business,” Sweeney told Reuters. “It’s a practice we’ve had in place for the past seven years.” Earlier, the company said it was disappointed with the union’s decision to reject a “competitive” offer. Harley, however, said production would continue as usual at all of its facilities. Under the proposed agreement, Harley’s employees would have received a 14 percent wage increase during the contract period as well as a $2,250 signing bonus. The proposal also included no changes to healthcare and significant pension enhancements for current employees, along with a retirement incentive for those eligible to retire, Harley said. The average wage for current, regular full-time employees under the first year of the agreement was proposed to be over $25 an hour in Tomahawk and over $33 per hour in the Milwaukee area. The statement did not quantify the financial impact of the proposal for a company that has been struggling to revive demand in the United States, which accounts for nearly 60 percent of total bike sales. Adding to its troubles, it is estimated that a tariff war waged by U.S. President Donald Trump will cost the company between $100 million and $120 million in 2019 and contribute to a 6-percentage-point drop in operating margins in the quarter that just ended. To avoid fallout from the tariff war, Harley is spending $15 million to expand a facility in Thailand to serve European markets. A decision to shift production out of the United States for European markets was announced last summer after the EU slapped tariffs on U.S. imports in response to Trump’s duties on steel and aluminum imports from the trading bloc. Trump had blasted Harley’s decision and publicly backed a boycott of the company."

StaCyc’s ‘EDRIVE’ bikes, which retail at around $650, are aimed at toddlers and kids, encouraging them to have fun outdoors as they learn to balance while getting a hang of biking. The lightweight bikes have an aluminum frame and boast of three power modes and a 45 to 60 minutes charge time. A single charge delivers a cycle time between 30 and 60 minutes. “The StaCyc electric two-wheelers will provide an entry point for the youngest riders,” Harley said in a statement. Harley’s sales have declined in the United States as its core baby boomer audience ages and millennials are slow to purchases its motorcycles that can cost upwards of $28,000. In January, the company said it expects to ship up to 222,000 motorcycles globally in 2019, the lowest number since 2010. The company last year unveiled a plan to introduce cheaper, nimbler bikes to woo young riders, and plans to launch its first electric motorcycle without the traditional clutch and gear-shift controls by fall this year. Harley aims to deliver “a full range of electric products for a vast audience,” Senior Vice President of marketing and brand Heather Malenshek said.

9.109241611213294," Harley sees 2019 shipments slump, shares drop; will boost Thai investment (Reuters) - Harley-Davidson Inc reported worse-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday and forecast a slump in global shipments of its motorcycles in 2019, sending its shares down 5 percent. Still, to avoid the fallout of a tariff war waged by U.S. President Donald Trump, the American company said it would boost investment at its Thailand plant to serve European markets. Such a move would allow its motorbikes to avoid retaliatory tariffs by the European Union on U.S. imports. The news on the Thailand facility was made public hours after Harley-Davidson reported a fourth straight year of declines in worldwide sales. The company has been struggling to revive demand in the United States, which accounts for nearly 60 percent of total sales. The company expects to ship up to 222,000 motorcycles globally in 2019, the lowest number since 2010. Shares closed $1.85 lower at $34.76. The stock of the Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based company has fallen about 30 percent since the beginning of 2018. The motorbike maker said tariffs alone, including import duties imposed by the European Union on its motorcycles, would amount to between $100 million and $120 million in 2019 and contribute to a 6-percentage-point drop in operating margins in the first quarter of this year. Operating margins in the fourth quarter declined 6.2 percentage points, in part due to the tariffs. Operating margins measure how much profit a company makes on a dollar of sales. The company will invest $15 million to expand the Thai facility in the city of Rayong, and shipments to Europe will begin by the end of 2019. The plant was originally intended to serve Southeast Asian and Chinese markets. The decision to shift production out of the United States for European markets was announced last summer after the EU slapped tariffs on U.S. imports in response to Trump’s duties on steel and aluminum imports from the trading bloc. Trump had blasted Harley’s decision and publicly backed a boycott of the company. His comments have compounded financial troubles in the United States for the company, as its core customers grow older and outreach efforts to lure younger riders have yet to show results. A survey published last week by market research firm YouGov found that Trump’s attack led to an erosion in Harley’s brand impression among its core customers.

-12.556206911615519," India's Royal Enfield targets tripling of U.S. sales this year (Reuters) - India-based motorcycle brand Royal Enfield expects sales in its new North American business to almost triple this year and is aiming to dominate the market for middleweight bikes into which Harley-Davidson Inc HOG.N has just shifted in a bid to revive sales. Enfield, originally a classic UK brand but manufactured by India's Eicher Motors Ltd EICH.NS in southern India since the early 1970s, has thwarted Harley's efforts to make inroads in India, the world's biggest two-wheeler market with some 17 million in sales annually. Both companies are dwarfed in the lightweight categories by India's Hero Motor Corp HROM.NS, Japan's Honda and Bajaj Auto BAJA.NS, and so far Enfield's presence outside India in the more specialized market in medium-sized and large cruisers has been minimal. Its arrival in North America three years ago signaled another headache for Harley, although sales of its iconic “Bullet” and “Classic” motorcycles have been stuck in the hundreds. Based in Milwaukee, also the home town of Harley, Enfield sold between 700 and 800 motorcycles in the year ended March, and expects to sell nearly 2,000 in the current fiscal year, according to its North America president, Rod Copes. “Our goal, over the next three to five and 10 years, is to be the largest middleweight motorcycle player, not just globally but also in North America. We want to get up to, where we are selling more than 10,000 to 15,000 motorcycles a year,” Copes told Reuters. The bikemaker has been able to capitalize on demand by helping younger riders own a cruiser bike, along the lines of Harley’s but at a more affordable price point. Enfield bikes come with a starting price tag of $4,000, which will rise to the $8,000 range following its new launches early next year. Harley’s entry level bike prices start at $6,899 and go up to $43,889. “The U.S. motorcycle market is flipped upside down and the only segment that is growing is the middle-weight. I think we are beginning to see a little bit of a trend and a change in the industry itself, away from maybe the bigger, the better to smaller is funner,” Copes added. Harley has been the historical market leader in the heavyweight motorcycle space in the United States and has been expanding into the middleweight motorcycle market with the launch of Street 500, Street 750 and the Street Rod range. While Harley’s shipments have been dropping in the United States as its mainstay customer base is aging, it still managed to ship 144,893 motorcycles in the United States in fiscal 2017, according to its annual SEC filing. The company does not break down those numbers into bike categories but analysts say almost all of those were heavyweight cruisers."
-3.8179117499737973," Harley-Davidson's weak U.S. sales, shipment forecast weigh on shares (Reuters) - Harley-Davidson Inc reported its steepest decline in domestic sales in eight years on Tuesday, and warned that motorcycle shipments for the year will be at the lower end of its forecast as it faces higher tariff-related costs. Milwaukee-based Harley’s shares reversed course and were down 5 percent, giving up premarket gains after company the recorded its best quarterly profit in two years. “We expect U.S. industry to remain challenged into 2019 and will continue to proactively address the weak U.S. industry,” Chief Financial Officer John Olin said on a conference call with analysts. Harley’s demographic challenges in the domestic market are well documented - core customers are growing older and efforts to attract new and young riders have yet to show results. In addition, President Donald Trump’s call to boycott the motorcycle manufacturer for its decision to move production for European markets overseas has only compounded the company’s troubles. Harley said on Tuesday it could see up to $48 million in costs from tariffs in 2018. Rising costs and a tit-for-tat tariff war with China have weighed on the shares of most U.S. manufacturers. Harley’s shares are down about 30 percent so far this year and have underperformed the broader S&P 500 index. Analysts at Goldman Sachs last week cut their 12-month price target for the stock, while BMO Capital Markets downgraded the company’s shares on Friday, citing its poor performance. To be sure, the company still dominates the local heavyweight motorcycle market, but rivals such as Polaris are chipping away at its market share. To counter weak demand at home, Harley plans to make deeper inroads into some of the fastest growing two-wheeler markets in Asia through lightweight motorcycles. Retail sales in the United States, which accounts for more than half of the company’s sales, fell 13.3 percent in the three months ended Sept. 30 from a year ago. Total retail sales were down 7 percent. Analysts expect 2018 to be the third straight year of declining sales. International retail sales, however, rose about 3 percent, led by Europe. “First look (EPS beat) looks good, but when you dig further you see that retail was worse than expected, especially in the United States,” Wedbush analyst James Hardiman said. The company’s net income jumped 67 percent to $113.86 million for the third quarter, helped by cost-cutting and higher international sales. Excluding manufacturing optimization costs, the company earned 78 cents a share. Revenue from motorcycles and related products rose 16.8 percent to $1.12 billion. Analysts on average expected a profit of 53 cents a share and revenue of $1.07 billion, according to data from Refinitiv. The company now expects 2018 shipments forecast to be at the low end of its guidance of between 231,000 and 236,000 motorcycles."

0.6489153884812746," Trump backs boycott of Harley Davidson in steel tariff dispute WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump backed boycotting American motorcycle manufacturer Harley Davidson Inc HOG.N on Sunday, the latest salvo in a dispute between the company and Trump over tariffs on steel. The Wisconsin-based motorcycle manufacturer announced a plan earlier this year to move production of motorcycles for the European Union from the United States to its overseas facilities to avoid the tariffs imposed by the trading bloc in retaliation for Trump’s duties on steel and aluminum imports. In response, Trump has criticized Harley Davidson, calling for higher, targeted taxes and threatening to lure foreign producers to the United States to increase competition. “Many @harleydavidson owners plan to boycott the company if manufacturing moves overseas. Great! Most other companies are coming in our direction, including Harley competitors. A really bad move! U.S. will soon have a level playing field, or better,” Trump said in a Twitter post. Harley Davidson has repeatedly declined to comment on Trump’s remarks over the course of the dispute. The company could not be immediately reached for comment on Sunday. Harley has forecast that the EU tariffs would cost the company about $30 million to $45 million for the remainder of 2018 and $90 million to $100 million on a full-year basis. Trump met Saturday with a group of bikers who support him, posing for pictures with about 180 bikers at his golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey, where he is on vacation. Motorcycle companies based outside the United States include Japan's Honda Motor Co Ltd 7267.T and Yamaha Corp 7951.T, Europe's BMW BMWG.DE and Ducati as well as India's Hero MotoCorp Ltd HROM.NS, Bajaj Auto Ltd BAJA.NS, among others."

The Milwaukee-based company, known for its heavy touring motorcycles, said last week it would launch a 250cc to 500cc motorcycle in India to boost sales in the world’s largest two-wheeler market as it grapples with an aging customer base and falling sales in the United States. Industry sales are projected to grow 25 percent a year in Asia’s third-largest economy in the 250cc to 500cc segment through 2021. “We realize that we as a company have been very focused on large heavyweight motorcycles and our expertise in the 250-500cc space needs to grow,” Marc McAllister, vice president of product portfolio at Harley-Davidson, told Reuters in an telephone interview on Friday. “We are looking for a strategic alliance that can help us grow through understanding the product, understanding the consumer, understanding the assembly,” he said. That could mean Harley will not necessarily make the new motorcycles at its own facility in India, and may instead use a local partner, McAllister said. He declined to discuss names or details of potential partners. Helped by rising discretionary spending, motorcycles sales in India are experiencing double-digit percentage growth, compared with tepid recent consumer demand in the United States. Lured by the enticing growth prospects, British motorcycle maker Triumph and Germany's BMW BMWG.DE have partnered with Indian companies Bajaj Auto BAJA.NS and TVS Motor TVSM.NS, respectively. Harley expects the lightweight segment to act as a “bridge” to its brand, said McAllister, giving it a chance to make deeper inroads into a market where over 20 million two-wheelers are sold annually. The company had been criticized by U.S. President Donald Trump over a plan move production for European customers overseas to avoid retaliatory tariffs in a trade dispute between the United States and European Union. Harley is hoping a foray into the lightweight segment, along with other new product launches, will expand its operating margins and add up to $250 million in operating profit in 2022. Analysts are skeptical of the profit targets as India is a highly cost-competitive market and lightweight bikes are historically lower-margin products. McAllister said the new bike will a premium product, but declined to reveal a price range.

-13.733006393788994," With nimbler bikes, Harley sharpens Asia focus to revive growth (Reuters) - Harley-Davidson Inc HOG.N is launching lightweight motorcycles in Asia and electric bikes globally in the hope of reviving demand, as it faces falling sales in the United States and the threat of trade tariffs adding to its costs. The 115-year-old Milwaukee-based company, known for its heavy touring motorcycles, is trying to boost overseas sales and scrambling to revamp operations as its mainstay customer base ages. Harley wants to woo younger buyers, particularly in fast-growing Asian markets including China and India, with nimbler motorcycles that have smaller engines. As part of a plan it calls “More Roads to Harley-Davidson”, the company expects to spend $675 million-$825 million over the next four years, chop costs and generate $5.9 billion-$6.4 billion in revenue in 2022. Harley expects the plan will expand its operating margins and add up to $250 million in operating profit in 2022. Within two years, the company hopes to unveil a lightweight motorcycle in India through an alliance with an Asian manufacturer, Harley Chief Executive Officer Matt Levatich said on a conference call with analysts. In a bid to attract customers globally, the company is also revamping stores, partnering with online retailers and launching a 1250cc custom model, Pan America, and a middleweight 975cc Streetfighter model in 2020. “If nothing else, Harley-Davidson is acknowledging the ongoing shift in global consumer tastes and sluggish U.S. participation rates, and is willing to make course corrections – and investments – to pursue areas of growth,” Raymond James analyst Joseph Altobello said. Harley has been at the center of a trade war between the United States and the European Union, with the company planning to shift production for European customers overseas to avoid the EU’s tariffs, a move that U.S. President Donald Trump has slammed. “The accelerated strategy will require significant investment to change the trajectory of the business globally, and the company plans to fund it entirely through comprehensive cost reduction and reallocation of previously planned investment and resources,” Harley said. Harley has also been investing in developing electric motorcycles as well as promoting its learn-to-ride academies at showrooms. Its first electric motorcycle will be launched next year, and more models are planned through 2022. Industry experts have said electric motorcycles - that have no gears or clutch and are a far cry from Harley’s loud, bulky cruising bikes - may not appeal to loyal Harley fans. Still, the company expects these motorcycles will be profitable and have “quite significant” revenue growth. “It’s risky to think that motorcyclists aren’t open-minded about other products and other brands,” Levatich said. Harley is betting on “bold new product introductions,” William Blair analyst Sharon Zackfia said, adding that the new products are likely to raise questions about whether the means of attracting new customers could alienate Harley’s core base. Shares of Harley - down 13 percent this year - were little changed on Monday afternoon."

-14.725331708430689," Harley-Davidson's profit beats estimates, shares rally (Reuters) - Harley-Davidson Inc's HOG.N shares rallied on Tuesday after the motorcycle maker forecast a lower-than-expected hit to profit margins from U.S. President Donald Trump's trade tariffs and its quarterly earnings topped Wall Street estimates. The forecast and results raised hopes 2018 profits will hold up better than expected, despite obstacles such as rising raw materials costs, higher tariffs on bikes shipped to Europe and an aging customer base. Harley’s shares opened higher on Tuesday and soared over 9 percent, recovering most of their losses since late June, when Trump attacked the company for planning to move production for European customers overseas. The stock closed up nearly 8 percent at $44.63. The Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based company now expects its motorcycles segment operating margin as a percent of revenue to be about 9 percent to 10 percent in 2018, compared with the 9.5 percent to 10.5 percent it projected earlier. The drop was due to higher steel and aluminum costs and a 25-percent retaliatory duty imposed by the European Union on the shipments from the United States. Those two factors together are estimated to cost Harley $45 million to $55 million this year. The company expects to absorb half of the increased costs through disciplined business management. “We are making every effort to mitigate the costs of those tariffs,” Chief Financial Officer John Olin told analysts on a conference call. David Beckel, an analyst at Bernstein, reckons the 50 basis points fall in operating margin would translate into about $25 million in added costs, below Harley’s previous estimate of an up to $65 million hit from higher raw materials costs and the European tariffs. This will likely result in upward revisions to the company’s 2018 earnings, Beckel said. Harley’s second-quarter net income fell to $248.3 million, or $1.45 per share in the second quarter ended July 1, from $258.9 million, or $1.48 per share, a year earlier. That exceeded analyst estimates of $1.34 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company retained its 2018 shipment forecast and said it would reveal plans on Monday about its strategy to train new riders, revive U.S. sales and grow its international business. Trump’s restrictive trade policies have inflated Harley’s raw material costs and put it in crosshairs of a trade skirmish with the European Union. Last month, Harley unveiled a plan to shift production for European customers overseas to avoid the EU’s retaliatory tariffs, a move that Trump slammed. On Tuesday, Chief Executive Matt Levatich stood by the company’s move, calling it “the best decision, given the circumstances.” Trade tariffs have compounded the troubles of a company that has been grappling with an aging customer base, weak demand from younger buyers and discounts offered by its rivals. Europe is Harley’s second biggest market after the United States. While U.S. retail sales fell 6.4 percent in the last quarter from a year ago, European sales were up about 4.3 percent year-on-year and accounted for half of international revenue. The company did not say where it would shift the production for European markets. Harley has assembly facilities in India and Brazil, and is expected to launch an assembly plant in Thailand in September."

The company said its net income fell to $248.3 million, or $1.45 per share in the second quarter ended July 1, from $258.9 million, or $1.48 per share, a year earlier. (bit.ly/2LJ2I9X) Revenue from motorcycles and related products fell 3.3 percent to $1.53 billion.

-7.866874222654505," Trade tariffs seen hurting Harley-Davidson's earnings CHICAGO (Reuters) - Harley-Davidson Inc HOG.N will give investors on Tuesday a fresh look at the impact of trade conflicts and a strong dollar on its profits, and analysts are bracing for bad news and more cost-cutting. Analysts polled by Reuters, on average, expect the Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based company to report a profit of $1.34 per share, below the $1.48 per share reported in the corresponding period a year ago. The earnings report comes a few weeks after Harley announced a plan to move production of motorcycles for the European Union from the United States to its overseas facilities to avoid the tariffs imposed by the trading bloc in retaliation for Trump’s duties on steel and aluminum imports. To offset falling demand at home, Harley has been aiming to boost overseas motorcycle sales to 50 percent of annual volume from about 43 percent. With revenues from EU countries second only to the United States, the region is a key part of its growth strategy. However, the decision to shift production overseas sparked an angry reaction from President Donald Trump, who threatened to impose higher taxes on the company and warned of a public backlash if Harley went ahead with the plan. Trump, however, did not specify how he could target Harley-Davidson with higher taxes, and no action has been taken since he made the threat in late June. Harley has assembly facilities in India and Brazil, and is expected to launch an assembly plant in Thailand in September. The fallout from Washington’s restrictive trade policies has exacerbated the travails of a company that has been grappling with an ageing customer base, weak demand from younger buyers and discounts offered by its rivals. Late last month, Harley forecast that the EU tariffs would cost the company about $30 million to $45 million for the remainder of 2018 and $90 million to $100 million on a full-year basis. That will be on top of an additional $15 million to $20 million the company is estimated to pay for raw materials this year because of rising steel and aluminum costs due to Trump’s tariffs on imports. Harley is still the dominant player in the heavyweight motorcycle market in the United States, but its market share has steadily fallen, to 50.4 percent from 58 percent in 2013. In January, it announced the closure of a plant in Kansas City, Missouri, after its motorcycle shipments fell to their lowest level in six years. Analysts at Goldman Sachs and Bernstein expect the company’s U.S. retail sales to be down 7 percent in the June quarter after a 12 percent annual decline in the first quarter. Goldman analysts said, “Harley may continue to rationalize its U.S. business throughout the year.” Harley-Davidson shares have lost about 8 percent since early March when the trade skirmish between the United States and the EU started, and are down over 22 percent since end-December 2017."

7.211109888021013," After Harley spat, Trump says other motorcycle firms may come to U.S. WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday his administration is working to bring other motorcycle companies to the United States, following Harley-Davidson Inc’s decision to shift some production for European customers overseas. Trump gave no details about what steps his administration is taking. Asked about the tweet, White House senior adviser Kellyanne Conway had no comment. “Now that Harley-Davidson is moving part of its operation out of the U.S., my Administration is working with other Motor Cycle companies who want to move into the U.S,” Trump said on Twitter, adding “The U.S. is where the Action is!” Harley-Davidson declined to comment on the tweet. Trump has threatened to impose higher taxes on the Milwaukee-based manufacturer in retaliation after it said on June 25 it was shifting some production for European-bound motorcycles from U.S. facilities to avoid tariffs being imposed by the European Union to counter U.S. duties imposed by Trump. Motorcycle companies based outside the United States include Japan’s Honda Motor Co Ltd and Yamaha Corp, Europe’s BMW and Ducati as well as India’s Hero MotoCorp Ltd, Bajaj Auto Ltd, among others. The company’s announcement shook Trump’s relationship with the iconic American brand. Executives had been feted at the White House during a visit with the president last year shortly after he took office. In the face of waning U.S. demand for motorcycles, Harley has turned its focus on overseas sales, opening assembly plants in Thailand, India and Brazil. “Harley’s primary issue is U.S.-related due to shifts in demographics, which began well before any talks of tariffs and trade wars. Trump’s reaction seems emotionally charged. Harley is simply playing the hand Trump dealt them,” Bernstein analyst David Beckel said. Shares of Harley were up 1.5 percent at $42.55 on the New York Stock Exchange. Its shares took a hit after Trump tweeted that the company would be “taxed like never before” after its production announcement, although he gave no further information. Trump on Tuesday also appeared to incorrectly tie Harley’s June announcement to its sales last year, saying Harley customers were unhappy with the move and that sales had fallen 7 percent in 2017."

(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump praised Taiwanese high-tech company Foxconn and vaguely threatened U.S. motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson on a campaign-style trip on Thursday to Wisconsin, a state that supported him in the 2016 election. Against a backdrop of a growing trade conflict between the United States and China, Trump helped Foxconn, the world’s largest electronics contract manufacturer, to break ground on a 13,000-employee U.S. plant. “As Foxconn has discovered, there is no better place to build, hire and grow than right here in the United States. America is open for business,” Trump said. Trump also had words for Milwaukee-based motorcycle maker Harley-Davidson Inc HOG.N, which he has threatened with higher taxes if it moves production for European customers overseas. “Harley-Davidson, please build those beautiful motorcycles in the USA,” he said. “Don’t get cute with us, don’t get cute.” Trump has levied tariffs on U.S. allies for what he considers unfair trade practices, sparking trade disputes that Harley-Davidson cited as its reason for moving some production overseas and which Foxconn has also cited as a major challenge.

9.025773451649457," Trump threatens Harley-Davidson over European production move WASHINGTON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump threatened Harley-Davidson Inc with higher taxes on Tuesday and said the motorcycle maker, which he previously hailed as a model of American manufacturing, would suffer from a public backlash if it went ahead with a plan to move production for European customers overseas. Trump’s attack, the latest in a series of criticisms of U.S. companies, was an about-face for the president, who hosted company officials and gleaming Harley-Davidson bikes on the White House lawn shortly after his inauguration. “A Harley-Davidson should never be built in another country-never! Their employees and customers are already very angry at them,” Trump said on Twitter, without providing any evidence. “If they move, watch, it will be the beginning of the end - they surrendered, they quit! The Aura will be gone and they will be taxed like never before!” Trump said. It was unclear what taxes Trump was referring to, and why the company might have to pay them, since it will maintain production in the United States for U.S. customers. The White House did not respond to a request for comment on Trump’s tweet. Harley-Davidson shares closed down 0.6 percent at $41.32, after falling nearly 6 percent on Monday. The Milwaukee-based company said on Monday it will move production of motorcycles shipped to the European Union from the United States to its international facilities and forecast that the trading bloc’s tariffs - introduced as a counter to Trump’s tariffs on some EU-produced metals - would cost the company $90 million to $100 million a year. Harley-Davidson said it had no comment on the president’s tweets. But company spokesman Michael Pflughoeft said it was assessing the potential impact of the production shift on its U.S. facilities. To view a graphic on Harley-Davidson's exposure to import tariffs, click: tmsnrt.rs/2K7Es4C ‘AN EXCUSE’ In a series of Twitter posts on Tuesday morning, Trump suggested the famous American brand was using trade tensions over tariffs as an excuse to move production. “Early this year Harley-Davidson said they would move much of their plant operations in Kansas City to Thailand. That was long before Tariffs were announced. Hence, they were just using Tariffs/Trade War as an excuse,” Trump said. In January, Harley-Davidson said it would close a plant in Kansas City, Missouri, due to a sharp drop in U.S. demand for its motorcycles, but said it would consolidate work done there into its plant in York, Pennsylvania. The company is setting up an assembly plant in Thailand, a move it announced in May 2017, but that would put together bikes only for the growing Southeast Asian market. The Thailand plant had no connection with the closure of the Kansas City facility, Harley-Davidson Chief Executive Matt Levatich told Reuters in an interview in February. The factory in Thailand, which will open later this year, would let Harley-Davidson avoid the country’s up to 60 percent tariffs on imported motorcycles and help it get tax breaks while exporting to neighboring countries, according to the company. Harley’s announcement of the Thailand plant came months after Trump pulled the United States out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would have lowered import tariffs on the company’s bikes in some of the fastest-growing motorcycle markets in Asia. Besides Thailand, Harley-Davidson has two more assembly plants outside the United States, in Brazil and India. The company has said ramping up production overseas could take at least nine to 18 months. As U.S. customers age and loyalty to the brand wanes, Harley-Davidson has been aiming to make up for falling U.S. demand by boosting overseas sales to 50 percent of annual volume from about 43 percent. Rising trade tensions and retaliatory tariffs could pose serious risks for Harley-Davidson, rating agency Moody’s said on Tuesday. Morningstar Equity Research said in a note that the tariffs might “temporarily” hamper some of the company’s planned growth initiatives. Trump first responded angrily to the Harley announcement on Monday, saying he has supported the 115-year-old manufacturer and was surprised by its plans, which he described as waving the “White Flag.” “I fought hard for them and ultimately they will not pay tariffs selling into the E.U., which has hurt us badly on trade, down $151 Billion. Taxes just a Harley excuse - be patient!” Trump said in a post on Twitter on Monday night. Trump enjoyed the support of a group called “Bikers for Trump” in his 2016 presidential campaign and he invited Harley-Davidson representatives to the White House in February 2017 shortly after he took office, greeting them with the words “Made in America, Harley-Davidson.” The company is only the latest targeted by Trump for various reasons. The president has repeatedly attacked Amazon.com Inc over what he sees as its unfair treatment of the U.S. Postal Service, and he has complained about the high costs of Boeing Co’s replacements for Air Force One aircraft, urging the federal government to cancel the order."

Trump said he has fought hard for the company and was surprised by its plans, which he described as waving the “White Flag.” Harley-Davidson, the dominant player in the heavyweight U.S. motorcycle market said earlier on Monday it would not pass on any retail or wholesale price increases in the EU and instead focus on shifting some U.S. production. Harley shares closed down nearly 6 percent and analysts cut their profit forecasts on concerns about how quickly the company would be able to adapt to the 25 percent import duties the European Union began charging on June 22. “I fought hard for them and ultimately they will not pay tariffs selling into the E.U., which has hurt us badly on trade, down $151 Billion. Taxes just a Harley excuse - be patient!” Trump said in a post on Twitter. The United States earlier this month imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum imports from the European Union, provoking a “tit-for-tat” response from the trading bloc against U.S. goods. In a regulatory filing, the 115-year-old Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based company said the retaliatory duties would result in an incremental cost of about $2,200 per average motorcycle exported from the United States to the European Union, but did not provide more details on current motorcycle costs. Harley’s entry-level bike in France currently costs 7,490 euros ($8,766). The company said it expects the tariffs to result in incremental costs of $30 million to $45 million for the rest of 2018 and $80 million to $100 million on a full-year basis. “We think Harley’s decision to protect EU demand is wise for the long-term health of the market,” Baird Equity Research said in a note. “But we expect the near-term impact to weigh on estimates and sentiment until a clearer path to mitigation is outlined.” Trump vowed to make the iconic motorcycle maker great again when he took office last year. But since then the company has been counting the costs of his trade policies. In late April, Harley said Trump’s metal tariffs would inflate its costs by $15 million to $20 million this year on top of already rising raw material prices that it expected at the start of the year. White House trade and manufacturing adviser Peter Navarro said on Monday the administration wants Harley to make more motorcycles in the United States. “Remember, they came to us, for example, pointing out that India had a 100 percent tariff on Harley Davidsons. That’s certainly not fair,” Navarro told CNBC. “We want Harleys made here, more made here, and that’s going to happen under the president’s trade policies.” In response to Navarro’s comments, a Harley spokesman said the company has made its position clear in Monday’s filing. Harley has been aiming to boost overseas sales of its motorcycles to 50 percent of annual volume from about 43 percent. In January, the company announced the closure of a plant in Kansas City, Missouri, after its motorcycle shipments fell to their lowest level in six years. In 2017, Harley sold nearly 40,000 new motorcycles in Europe which accounted for more than 16 percent of the company’s sales. The revenues from EU countries were second only to the United States. Harley said ramping up production overseas could take at least nine to 18 months. It has three assembly plants outside the United States - one each in Brazil, India and Thailand. The company decided to build the Thailand plant after Trump pulled out from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would have lowered import tariffs on its bikes in some of the fastest-growing motorcycle markets in Asia. The company said it will provide more details on tariff-related plans when it reports second-quarter earnings on July 24. Analysts at Baird Equity Research cut its 2018 profit estimates for Harley-Davidson to $3.70 per share from $3.90 and now expect 2019 profit of $3.85, down from $4.20. CFRA Research lowered its 12-month price target for the stock to $47 from $49. Harley-Davidson shares have lost about 9 percent since early March when the trade skirmish between the United States and the EU started, and are down over 18 percent since end-December 2017. Mercedes-Benz maker Daimler DAIGn.DE last week cut its 2018 profit forecast citing growing trade tensions. Its German rival BMW BMWG.DE said it was considering ""possible strategic options"" in view of the rising trade tensions between China and the United States. Trump has also threatened to crackdown on auto imports. Analysts at Moody's reckon a 25 percent tariff on imported vehicles and parts would be negative for most of companies including Ford Motor Co F.N and General Motors Co GM.N."

8.654069172557548," CORRECTED-UPDATE 2-Harley-Davidson to move some production out of US to avoid EU tariffs (Corrects paragraph 9 to show share of sales in Europe were more than 16 percent, not 14 percent) June 25 (Reuters) - Harley-Davidson Inc said on Monday it would move production of motorcycles shipped to the European Union from the United States to its international facilities and forecast the trading bloc’s retaliatory tariffs would cost the company $90 million to $100 million a year. The shift in production is an unintended consequence of U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration imposing tariffs on European steel and aluminum early this month, a move designed to protect U.S. jobs. In response to the U.S. tariffs, the European Union began charging import duties of 25 percent on a range of U.S. products including big motorcycles like Harley’s on June 22. In a regulatory filing bit.ly/2tA1ru0 on Monday, the Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based company said the retaliatory duties would result in an incremental cost of about $2,200 per average motorcycle exported from the United States to the European Union, but it would not raise retail or wholesale prices for its dealers to cover the costs of the tariffs. The company expects the tariffs to result in incremental costs of $30 million to $45 million for the rest of 2018, the filing said. “Harley-Davidson believes the tremendous cost increase, if passed onto its dealers and retail customers, would have an immediate and lasting detrimental impact to its business in the region,” the company said. Struggling to overcome a slump in U.S. demand, Harley has been aiming to boost sales of its iconic motorcycles overseas to 50 percent of total annual volume from about 43 percent currently. In January, the company announced the closure of a plant in Kansas City, Missouri as part of a consolidation plan after its motorcycle shipments fell to their lowest level in six years. In 2017, Harley sold nearly 40,000 new motorcycles in Europe which accounted for more than 16 percent of the company’s sales last year. The revenues from EU countries were second only to the United States. Harley said ramping-up production at its overseas international plants will require incremental investments and could take at least nine to 18 months. The company will provide more details of the financial implications of retaliatory EU tariffs and plans to offset their impact on July 24 when its second-quarter earnings are due, the filing said.

3.443129715162381," Harley says EU duties could prompt price hikes FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Harley-Davidson Inc could be forced to raise prices in Europe due to EU tariffs on U.S. goods, hitting buyers of new motorcycle models when they are shipped to dealers later in the year, the head of its central European business said. Earlier this week, the European Commission said it would start charging import duties of 25 percent on a range of U.S. products from Friday after Washington imposed tariffs on EU steel and aluminum at the start of June. “Of course this will have an impact on the price. We will try and make it as painless as possible but no company can foot this alone,” Christian Arnezeder told Reuters TV in an interview. A spokeswoman for the company said the group was still evaluating the potential impacts of EU duties, and that no decisions on pricing had been made. Harley says it is getting hit by tariffs twice: Once by the EU import duty and once by a rise in raw material prices resulting from U.S. steel tariffs. For the moment, though, Harley does not need to raise prices as it used the roughly three months since Europe first threatened to impose duties on its motorcycles to prepare. “We tried to get the current model to Europe as quickly as possible, as far as production allowed for it,” Arnezeder said. He also said that the anticipation of tariffs boosted demand as customers sought to snap up motorcycles before prices rise. “You could tell on the market, in talking to dealers, that some customers said, I want to fulfill my dream before any tariffs come into effect,” he said. Struggling to overcome a slump in U.S. demand, Harley has been aiming to boost sales of its motorcycles overseas to 50 percent of total annual volume from about 43 percent currently. Europe, the Middle East and Africa accounted for little over 21 percent of its global retail sales in the last quarter."
4.768932126702851," Harley warns of hit from EU reprisal against Trump's tariffs (Reuters) - Harley-Davidson Inc on Friday warned of a “significant impact” on its sales after the European Union revealed plans to increase duties on a range of U.S. imports, including big motorcycles, in reprisal for Washington’s new tariffs on EU metal exports. After failing to win trade concessions, the Trump administration on Thursday withdrew the exemptions given to the steel and aluminum imports from the EU, Canada and Mexico from global tariffs that it imposed in March citing national security concerns. The EU took the United States to the World Trade Organization to challenge the legality of the new tariffs and the Trump administration’s national-security justification. Brussels has submitted an eight-page list to the international trade body, covering goods it would hit with retaliatory measures. The list includes U.S. exports running the gamut from big motorcycles like Harley’s, built on the home turf of U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, to “canoes”, “manicure or pedicure preparations” and even “sinks and washbasins, of stainless steel” -- the proverbial kitchen sink. “We support free and fair trade and hope for a quick resolution to this issue,” Harley said in a statement. “We believe a punitive, retaliatory tariff on Harley-Davidson motorcycles in any of our major markets would have a significant impact on our sales, our dealers, our suppliers and our customers in those markets,” the statement said. Harley said it was currently evaluating options for managing anticipated cost increases following the EU’s proposed measure. Shares of the Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based company were down nearly 2 percent in Friday afternoon trade. Struggling to overcome a slump in U.S. demand, Harley has been aiming to boost sales of its iconic motorcycles overseas to 50 percent of total annual volume from about 43 percent currently.

7.17272610423747," Harley-Davidson backs forecast, investors see signs of recovery (Reuters) - Harley-Davidson Inc HOG.N stood by its full-year shipments forecast and said it expects dealers to sell more motorcycles in overseas markets, offering a glimmer of hope to a business struggling with an aging customer base in the United States. The company’s shares rose about 3.6 percent on Tuesday as investors looked past a further 7 percent decline in overall retail sales. Harley, which commands about half of the U.S. big-bike market, has seen its U.S. market share erode in the past few years as buyers opt for heavily discounted bikes from rivals. “A lot of investors were expecting a guidance (2018 shipments) to be lowered, that didn’t happen,” Northcoast Research analyst Seth Woolf said. To revive demand, Harley is spending aggressively on product development and marketing, including promoting its learn-to-ride academies at showrooms and developing electric motorcycle technology. “There is more marketing and sales support queued up to deliver our spring sales goals,” Chief Executive Officer Matt Levatich said, adding that its two new bikes launched this year were well received by dealers and customers. Total shipments - motorcycles shipped to dealers - fell 9.7 percent. For the second quarter, it expects to ship about 67,500 to 72,500 motorcycles, down from 81,807 units a year earlier. For the full year, it reiterated shipments of between 231,000 and 236,000 units. International sales rose 0.2 percent - after five straight quarters of declines. Harley, which has already been pressured by higher steel and aluminum prices, said prices have risen further since U.S. President Donald Trump moved to impose tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. The tariffs, which have not hurt Harley’s sales yet, could potentially place the company in the middle of a trade war, with the European Commission threatening to slap duties on Harley’s motorcycles. Harley said it was working with trade groups and various trade officials in both countries. “We enter this year with full awareness of the headwinds we face, and we are making progress against our plans to address challenges,” Levatich said. The Milwaukee, Wisconsin-based company’s profit fell 6.2 percent to $174.8 million, or $1.03 per share, in quarter ended April 1, but topped estimate of 90 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue from motorcycles and related products rose 2.7 percent to $1.36 billion, beating estimate of $1.23 billion. “1Q18 appears to be when HOG finally got expectations low enough to not miss,” Morgan Stanley Carmen Hundley said."
