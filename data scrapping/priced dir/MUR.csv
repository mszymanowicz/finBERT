28.582380428615306," Oil producers evacuate U.S. Gulf of Mexico platforms as storm brews HOUSTON (Reuters) - U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil producers on Saturday evacuated offshore facilities as a tropical storm brewing off the Florida coast was forecast to strengthen into a hurricane and threaten the prime oil region. Chevron Corp CVX.N and Murphy Oil Corp MUR.N on Saturday started removing workers from offshore oil and gas platforms. Royal Dutch Shell, BHP, BP and Hess Corp said they were monitoring the storm and prepared to take action if needed. Tropical storm Sally crossed the tip of Florida overnight and moved into the eastern Gulf of Mexico. The latest forecast by the National Hurricane Center calls for its maximum sustained winds to reach 80 miles per hour (129 kph) ahead of landfall next week. Chevron has begun evacuating all staff from its Blind Faith and Petronius platforms and initiated shut-in procedures, a spokeswoman said, while production at its other offshore platforms was unaffected. Murphy Oil was preparing to evacuate non-essential personnel from its most easterly facilities and monitoring the storm for potential impact on other properties, a spokeswoman said. U.S. Gulf of Mexico offshore oil production accounts for about 17% of U.S. crude oil production and 5% of total U.S. natural gas production. As much as 1.5 million barrels per day of oil output was shut last month as Hurricane Laura tore through the Gulf of Mexico. Sally was forecast to strengthen in the next several days and head for an area between southeastern Louisiana and Alabama. If Sally becomes a hurricane, it would be the second to hit the U.S. Gulf Coast in less than a month. Hurricane Laura struck Louisiana with devastating, 150 mph winds, leveling coastal towns and putting two oil refineries out of commission for weeks."

Murphy, which also has operations in Canada, Brazil and other regions, has said it would focus on the Western Hemisphere - mostly on the Eagle Ford basin in Texas and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico - for future exploration and production deals. It has been increasing its deepwater, oil-weighted Gulf of Mexico assets in recent months, while looking to divest a portfolio of its assets in Malaysia. The deal will add about 32,000 net barrels to 35,000 net barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) this year to Murphy’s Gulf of Mexico production, which constitutes about 60 percent oil. Earlier this month, Chevron Corp said it would acquire Anadarko Petroleum Corp for $33 billion, which adds to the oil major’s deepwater investments in the Gulf of Mexico. Murphy said it would fund the acquisition with a combination of cash on hand and debt under the company’s $1.6 billion revolving credit facility."

-11.796460995804036," Murphy Oil sells Malaysia assets to PTTEP for $2.1 billion, turns toward home (Reuters) - Murphy Oil Corp is exiting Malaysia with a $2.13 billion sale of its oil and gas assets there to Thailand’s PTTEP and said it will use the proceeds to pay down debt, buy back shares and fund potential deals in the United States. Besides the enterprise value of the sale, PTT Exploration and Production Public Co Ltd (PTTEP), a unit of state-owned PTT PCL, will also pay Murphy Oil up to $100 million as a bonus if certain exploration projects show results before October 2020, the companies said on Thursday. The deal between Murphy and PTTEP comes as M&A activity is heating up in Malaysia’s oil and gas sector, where global companies pursuing expansion plans are spotting opportunities. Reuters reported that Murphy was nearing a deal to sell its Malaysian assets to PTTEP earlier on Thursday. “Like many Asian national companies, PTTEP suffers from a maturing domestic portfolio. To improve its production outlook the company has been on the hunt for license extensions and counter-cyclical M&A opportunities, with a focus on Southeast Asia,” said Alex Siow, a research analyst at energy research firm Wood Mackenzie, in an email. “This is the biggest oil and gas deal in Southeast Asia for over five years, and supports our view that 2019 is set to be a big year for M&A activity in the region,” he said. Reuters reported in November, citing sources, that Murphy was in talks to sell its Malaysian assets after an unsolicited bid. Sources had said Spanish oil major Repsol, whose presence in Malaysia is focused on the upstream sector, or other global majors could be potential buyers for Murphy’s assets. Murphy had proven reserves of 816 million barrels of oil equivalent (boe) in 2018, of which 129 million boe were from Malaysia. Those assets produced over 48,000 boe per day for Murphy last year. The deal follows moves by other U.S. oil majors to turn investment to high-yielding shale fields at home, where output has soared to more than 12 million barrels per day (bpd), rising over 2 million bpd since early 2018. Murphy, which also has operations in Canada, Brazil and other regions, said it will focus on the Western Hemisphere - mostly on the Eagle Ford basin in Texas and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico - for future exploration and production deals. “We expect to generate approximately $1.2 billion of free cash flow at a flat $55 West Texas Intermediate price,” CEO Roger Jenkins said on a call with analysts. Futures for light crude were trading at around $60 per barrel on Friday. [O/R] Murphy shares rose as much as 1.8 percent before closing at $30.97 on Thursday. PTTEP said the deal is expected to promptly raise sales volumes by 15 percent and operating cash flow upon completion. “This diversified self-funded portfolio will add a mix of production, development and exploration assets that will provide immediate revenue stream, production and reserves for both short and long term,” PTTEP said in a statement. Malaysian state-owned Petronas partners Murphy in Malaysia, which has seen M&A pick-up in the energy sector. In September, Austrian oil and gas company OMV agreed on a joint venture with Sapura Energy Bhd, paying $540 million for a 50 percent stake in the exploration assets of the Malaysian firm. In August, citing sources, Reuters reported that U.S. company Hess Corp’s Southeast Asian offshore natural gas assets had attracted bid interest from PTTEP and OMV. Hess later said it had no plans to sell its Southeast Asian assets. Murphy also announced a $500 million share buyback as well as debt reduction of about $750 million. The company had about $3 billion in debts as of December 2018. The deal on the Malaysian assets is expected to close by the end of the second quarter. Bank of America Merrill Lynch served as advisor to Murphy on the sale, while Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co was the financial advisor. Jefferies Group LLC was the financial advisor to PTTEP."

-8.611635395484038," Exclusive: Murphy Oil in talks to sell Malaysian oil, gas assets - sources SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Murphy Oil Corporation is in talks to sell its Malaysian oil and gas assets after an unsolicited bid that could fetch between $2 billion to $3 billion, people familiar with the matter said, in the latest energy M&A deal in the Southeast Asian nation. The independent U.S. oil and gas exploration and production company has tapped banks for the potential sale of its majority interests in eight separate offshore production sharing contracts in Malaysia, said the people, who declined to be identified because the matter is confidential. “Murphy wasn’t considering a sale but was approached by a party that put forward a very compelling bid. They are in negotiations,” said one of the people. Murphy, which has been in Malaysia since 1999, could agree on a deal in a couple of weeks, the person said. Others familiar with the matter suggested Spanish oil major Repsol , whose presence in Malaysia is focused on its upstream business, or other global majors could be potential buyers for Murphy’s assets. The possible transaction comes as M&A activity is heating up in Malaysia’s oil and gas sector, where international companies pursuing expansion plans are spotting opportunities. Repsol and Murphy declined to comment on any potential transaction or talks. There was no response to a query sent by Reuters to Malaysian state-owned Petronas, who partners Murphy in Malaysia. “This is a good, balanced portfolio and offers a smart way for someone looking to grow quickly in the region. Otherwise, it’ll take a decade to start from scratch,” said Alex Siow, upstream oil and gas analyst at energy research firm Wood Mackenzie. “The buyer will be buying into an operators position with Murphy’s stake, therefore having the know-how and will to be an operator is important,” Siow said. In September, Austrian oil and gas company OMV agreed on a joint venture with Samurai Energy Bed, paying $540 million for a 50 percent stake in the exploration assets of the Malaysian firm. In August, citing sources, Reuters reported that U.S. company Hess Corp’s Southeast Asian offshore natural gas assets had attracted bid interest from the likes of Thailand’s PTTEP PC and OMV. Hess later said it had no plans to sell its Southeast Asian assets. People familiar with Murphy’s business said the company could use the sale proceeds to fund its global expansion plans. Last month, Brazil’s state-controlled oil company Petrobras and Murphy announced a joint venture to explore oil and gas fields in the Gulf of Mexico. Murphy produced nearly 46,700 barrels of oil equivalent a day in the quarter ended Sept. 30 in Malaysia, the company said in response to a query from Reuters. In Southeast Asia, it also has production sharing agreements in Brunei and assets in Vietnam. “The potential exit seems like a strategic decision based on where Murphy sees greater growth potential. These are high quality assets and of a good size for companies looking for a strong footprint in the region,” said one banker familiar with Murphy’s business, referring to the assets in Malaysia. In September 2014, Murphy announced the sale of a 30 percent stake in its Malaysian assets to Indonesian state-oil company Pertain for $2 billion as it cut its overseas holdings. Oil prices, which were hovering around $91 a barrel at that time, have fallen to near $52 a barrel. Prices have shed almost a third of their value since early last month. [O/R]"
