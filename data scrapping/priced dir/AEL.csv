12.718881822767795," American Equity partners with Brookfield, rejects Athene, MassMutual takeover bid (Reuters) - American Equity Investment Life Holding Co AEL.N said on Sunday that it entered into a strategic partnership with Brookfield Asset Management Inc BAMa.TO and rejected an unsolicited acquisition proposal from Athene Holding Ltd ATH.N and Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. Canadian private equity firm Brookfield is taking a 19.9% stake in American Equity at $37 per share for an initial investment, the company said in a statement refini.tv/3o2vkhI. Brookfield is purchasing its American Equity shares in two installments, the first at a price of $37 per share and the second at a variable price where the floor is $37 a share. It will also reinsure up to $10 billion of American Equity fixed index annuity liabilities. Brookfield will also receive a board seat on American Equity following the initial investment. The board of American Equity rejected the unsolicited acquisition proposal from Athene and MassMutual made public on Oct. 1, saying it significantly undervalued the company. That deal was valued at more than $3 billion. “Since the board of directors of American Equity has decided to reject our joint proposal, we will continue with the execution of our standalone strategy,” Athene Holdings said in response to the rejection. The American Equity board has also authorized the share repurchase of up to $500 million of common shares to be funded with the proceeds of the Brookfield equity investment and cash on hand, the company said. The repurchase is expected to offset dilution from the issuance of common shares to Brookfield, the company added."

The West Des Moines, Iowa-based company, which sells fixed index and fixed rate annuity products, is working with an investment bank as it discusses a potential sale with interested suitors, the sources said. Reinsurance firms, such as Athene Holding Ltd ATH.N, and annuities and life insurance providers, such as FGL Holdings FG.N, could be among those expressing an interest in an acquisition of American Equity, the sources added. The sources cautioned that no deal is certain and asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. American Equity, Athene and FGL Holdings did not immediately respond to requests for comment. American Equity shares ended up 11.2 percent at $32.28 on the news on Tuesday, giving the company a market capitalization of $2.9 billion. Earlier this month, American Equity reported 2018 first-quarter net income of $141 million compared with net income of $53.9 million for the first quarter of 2017.
