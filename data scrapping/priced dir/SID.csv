In a conference call with analysts, Chief Executive Benjamin Steinbruch said he is pushing for the right price to sell the German unit, which is key to hitting a debt reduction target by the end of the year.

36.19351361286844," Brazil companies complain to watchdog about Vale acquisition BRASILIA/SAO PAULO, Feb 13 (Reuters) - Brazilian steelmaker Cia Siderurgica Nacional (CSN) and port company Porto Sudeste have lodged complaints against miner Vale SA’s proposed acquisition of rival Ferrous Resources Ltd, antitrust regulator Cade said on Wednesday. Vale’s plan to buy Ferrous from controlling shareholder Icahn Enterprises LP in a $550 million deal was announced in December. Vale is also facing unprecedented scrutiny in Brazil following the collapse of a mining dam in the town of Brumadinho last month that likely killed hundreds in a deadly mud flow. Cade’s technical staff in the superintendent’s office is currently reviewing the Ferrous acquisition. A Cade spokeswoman confirmed the complaints from CSN and Porto Sudeste, which were first reported in newspaper Valor Economico. CSN said in a letter to Cade that the acquisition of Ferrous would give an even more dominant market position to Vale, which it says controls roughly 80 percent of Brazil’s iron ore market, restricting CSN’s access to logistical infrastructure. In a separate letter, Porto Sudeste said that Vale would reduce competition in the iron ore market of southeast Brazil. Porto Sudeste currently ships iron ore from Ferrous and any move by Vale to shift these shipments to its own infrastructure could hurt the port. Ferrous Resources currently produces 4 million tonnes of iron ore annually, according to a spokesman. Vale produced 366.5 million tonnes of iron ore and pellets in 2017, according to the company’s website. Vale said in a statement that the proposed transaction does not have anti-competitive effects and would not hurt the Brazilian market. CSN and Porto Sudeste did not respond to requests for comment."

One source said Glencore GLEN.L, which would receive 20 million tonnes of iron ore over the period, would sign the deal no later than the first quarter. The Brazilian steelmaker is aiming to reduce debts that piled up after an iron ore and steel price rout in 2015-2016 and a severe recession in Brazil, prompting investors to demand asset sales. Glencore GLEN.L, which sources said would secure backing from banks for the deal, and CSN CSNA3.SA declined to comment. The deal with Glencore comes against a backdrop of rising iron ore prices, after the collapse of a tailings dam run by Brazilian mining giant Vale VALE3.SA that forced the firm to announce plans to cut 10 percent of its output. Benchmark iron ore prices SH-CCN-IRNOR62 were trading at $85.3 a tonne on Thursday, after plunging as low as $38.50 tonne at the end of 2015. To cut debts, CSN sold its U.S. unit for $400 million last year and Chief Executive Benjamin Steinbruch promised to sell assets worth an additional $1 billion, although none of those sales have yet materialized. A court ruled in August against allowing the firm to pay dividends. CSN’s net debt was equivalent to 5.8 times annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) in the first quarter of 2018. Steinbruch had said in May he aimed to cut it to three times by the end of 2018. But analysts at Brazilian bank Itau BBA, a unit of Itau Unibanco, put the ratio at 4.8 times at the end of 2018 and said they expected it to drop to just 4.3 times by the end of 2019, if there were no asset sales. Itau BBA said in a January note that CSN’s divestments in the short term were likely to include the sale of Stahlwerk Thuringen (SWT) and Lusosider, expected to raise $754 million in total, and iron ore streaming activities, expected to raise $538 million. SWT is a producer of long steels in Germany and Lusosider is a Portuguese steel sheet producer. Itau BBA said an asset sales program of $1 billion or more could propel CSN into a “virtuous cycle”, giving it access to cheaper debt and making more funding available to invest in its mining and steel assets. CSN Mining is Brazil’s second largest iron ore exporter and produced nearly 30 million tonnes of the raw material for steel in 2017. Vale is the world’s largest iron ore miner and is Brazil’s biggest exporter."
