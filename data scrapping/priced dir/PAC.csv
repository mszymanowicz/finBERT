-2.606193656093483," UPDATE 1-Mexican airport group GAP sees no passenger recovery before 2023 (Updates with details) MEXICO CITY, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Passenger traffic at Mexican airport operator Grupo Aeroportuario del Pacifico (GAP) is unlikely to recover to pre-pandemic levels before 2023 at the earliest, Chief Executive Officer Raul Revuelta said on Wednesday. As with its peers, GAP’s operations have been hammered by lockdown measures to contain the virus that has caused the death of more than 1.5 million people worldwide. One of Mexico’s main airport operators, GAP between January and November registered 24.4 million travelers at the 14 hubs it operates in Mexico and Jamaica, barely half of the 48.7 million passengers it logged during all of last year. “We think we won’t see the same number of passengers that we had in 2019 until between 2023 and 2024,” Revuelta told Reuters in an interview. The company based in the western city of Guadalajara aims to issue its first debt of 2021 during the first few months in order to help fund its investment plans, Revuelta said. “Some time around the first quarter we’ll launch our first issue, but we’re still in the preliminary stage of determining more specific amounts and dates,” he added. Last month GAP announced a 20-month delay in its spending plans, which include more than 21 billion pesos ($1.1 billion) worth of outlays at its airports. As a result, it now expects that work to conclude in mid-2026 instead of December 2024. “Yes, we have delays, but in general terms, the big works that we had planned for the different airports will end up going ahead,” Revuelta said.

33.9413927045863," Markets sweat over Mexican president's 'true colors' on inauguration eve MEXICO CITY/NEW YORK (Reuters) - During Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador’s successful campaign for the Mexican presidency, his advisers met representatives of dozens of investment funds to allay fears about the leftist’s plans, saying he prized economic stability and wanted to attract foreign capital. Initially, it worked. When Lopez Obrador won office by a landslide on July 1, the peso and the stock market rose, buoyed by his conciliatory tone. The rally continued when Mexico and the United States reached a deal to rework the NAFTA trade pact in late August. But the mood has since changed. Lopez Obrador, who takes office on Saturday, began saying in September that Mexico was “bankrupt.” When he canceled a new $13 billion Mexico City airport on Oct. 29 on the basis of a widely-derided referendum, investors took flight. “(Lopez Obrador) behaved quite well from the election in early July until the referendum on the airport. That was really an indication of his true colors,” said Penny Foley, portfolio manager for emerging markets and international equities groups at TCW Group Inc, which manages $198 billion in total. Foley said the referendum prompted TCW to cut its exposure to bonds issued by state oil firm Pemex, on the grounds that under a Lopez Obrador administration the company would be driven more by politics than by profit. “We are now slightly underweight Mexico in the dollar fund and neutral in the local currency fund,” she added. Lopez Obrador wants to attract investment from home and abroad to fuel economic growth and drive an ambitious infrastructure agenda, including a major rail project linking Cancun to Mexico’s southeast, plus a new oil refinery. Decisions such as the airport cancellation have fed investors’ concerns he could push Mexico toward a more authoritarian, arbitrary and partisan form of government. Mexico’s S&P/BVM IPC stock index has tumbled 18 percent since the market’s post-election peak on Aug. 28, while the peso has fallen around 8 percent against the dollar. In an interview published on Friday, Lopez Obrador said the drop in the Mexican stock index was linked to external factors and that other bourses were falling too. “I’d also like to note that we’re not just going to govern for the markets,” he told Mexican newspaper La Jornada. Over the same three-month period, the MSCI Emerging Markets index has fallen about 7 percent. Bond yields on Mexican 10-year sovereign debt have jumped 121 basis points, a sign investors see it as a riskier bet. By contrast, yields on Brazil’s 10-year debt have fallen over 20 basis points since the Oct. 28 presidential election victory of Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right politician who has appointed a group of pro-market economists to his team. Mexican corporate debt markets have taken note. Airport operator GAP, which controls terminals in a dozen cities including Tijuana and Guadalajara, canceled a planned 6 billion peso debt issuance this week. “We decided to wait for better conditions”, GAP chief financial officer Saul Villarreal told Reuters. Some European businesses are also in wait-and-see mode, said Alberico Peyron, a board member and former head of the Italian chamber of commerce in Mexico. There was “no panic so far”, but a few executives had put plans on hold until the picture became clearer, he said, adding: “There are more who are worried than are optimistic.” Mexico, Brazil forward price-to-earnings ratios: tmsnrt.rs/2rcLAAC ‘ERRORS’ MADE After 30 years of kicking against the establishment, the veteran Lopez Obrador, a 65-year-old former mayor of Mexico City, claimed the presidency with a promise to clean up government, cut poverty and tame Mexico’s drug cartels. Aiming to almost double economic growth to around 4 percent, Lopez Obrador wants to revive Pemex, increase pensions and spur development in the poorer south to contain illegal immigration that has strained ties with U.S. President Donald Trump. Lopez Obrador says rooting out corruption will free up billions of dollars, while he intends to save more with pay cuts for civil servants. However, critics say the cuts could affect the quality of officials in his new administration. Johannes Hauser, managing director of the German chamber of commerce in Mexico, told Reuters the association’s annual survey of firms, currently underway, was upbeat on Mexico. Still, initial results suggested companies were not quite as eager to invest or create new jobs as they were a year ago. And the airport cancellation had been a shock, he said. During their campaign outreach, some of Lopez Obrador’s advisers sought to play down the airport’s importance to markets, while others suggested it was likely to be completed. Without providing evidence, Lopez Obrador said the project - which has been under construction since 2015 - was tainted by corruption. But more than once, Lopez Obrador had raised the possibility of turning its completion into a private concession. Incoming Finance Minister Carlos Urzua, whose team sat down with financial heavyweights such as Bank of America, BlackRock, Credit Suisse and Morgan Stanley, told Reuters in April that foreign investors were “not very worried” about the airport. Now, the scrapping of the hub has raised the prospect of a messy legal dispute with investors that could cost billions of dollars - as well as cloud interest in new projects. Some members of Lopez Obrador’s incoming government privately express deep misgivings about the decision to cancel the airport, which was based on a referendum organized by his own party in which barely 1 percent of the electorate voted. They felt the poll, which critics lambasted as opaque and open to abuse, undermined the credibility he had built up over the years he spent campaigning against corruption and vote-rigging. Lopez Obrador’s taste for rule by referendum, and changes to laws governing everything from banking to mining and pension funds that have been proposed by his National Regeneration Movement and the party’s allies in Congress, have further curdled sentiment. “I’ve moved from being cautiously optimistic after the election, to being quite pessimistic now,” said Andres Rozental, a former deputy foreign minister of Mexico. “He’s not building on what he got. He’s destroying little by little what he got.” Facing questions about the airport controversy from a panel of prominent Mexican journalists this month, Lopez Obrador was unrepentant about the referendum, saying that “errors” made were blown out of proportion by adversaries trying to hurt him. “What I regard as most important in my life is my honesty,” he said. “We are not creating a dictatorship,” he added, repeating what is a frequent aside in his public pronouncements. Nevertheless, Arturo Herrera, an incoming deputy finance minister, conceded this week that the transition had tested the next government, which must present its first budget by mid-December. “What we’re all learning is that we need to be extremely careful,” he told Mexican television.

-2.0537828384566574," Incoming Mexico government starts airport consultation, business leaders worry MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico’s incoming government opened polls on Thursday for a public consultation to decide whether to ditch a multi-billion-dollar new airport, a possibility that worries markets and business leaders. The poll from Oct. 25 to Oct. 28 will show if the government of leftist President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador should finish the ambitious but costly new Mexico City airport or scrap it and upgrade a military air base to complement a current hub. The consultation is being held in more than 500 municipalities, home to about 80 percent of the population, incoming transport minister Javier Jimenez Espriu said. More than 184,000 people cast ballots on Thursday in turnout that exceeded expectations, Lopez Obrador’s team said in a statement. The results of the poll, which will guide the final decision of the new government, are one of the first big tests of Lopez Obrador’s economic policy and his relations with the country’s business elite he criticized during the campaign. Moises Kalach, a senior member of Mexico’s powerful CCE business lobby, told media he was worried any contract cancellations could violate international treaties, adding that markets needed certainty. Lopez Obrador, who takes office on Dec. 1 after a landslide victory, jokingly asked reporters to turn off their cameras as he cast his ballot at a Mexico City polling station, saying his vote was secret. He ruled out an impact on the economy, saying contracts to develop the new airport would be “backed, protected, no injustice will be committed” even if the project was scrapped. Some business leaders have warned that project cancellation could spook investors and hit the Mexican peso and government bonds. “The impact on risk premiums and particularly on the currency could be significant,” analysts at BBVA Bancomer said in a note. Opposition parties say the consultation has not followed the rules for referendums. “This consultation is unnecessary, since it will only serve to justify the decision that the president-elect has already made, and which he made public during his electoral campaign,” the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution said in a statement. The incoming president has railed against the new airport, saying it has been tainted by corruption and will be costlier than planned. The new airport, under construction on a drained lakebed on Mexico City’s eastern flank since 2015, is about 20 percent to 30 percent complete. The Texcoco airport is projected to cost 285 billion Mexican pesos ($14.6 billion), up from an original estimate of 195 billion, says incoming transport minister Jimenez Espriu.

-6.489728262358925," Incoming Mexico government to survey public opinion on new airport MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico’s incoming government will hold a four-day public consultation to decide the fate of the capital’s part-built new airport and will upgrade facilities at the existing airport to ease congestion, a member of the next Cabinet said on Thursday. Incoming transport minister Javier Jimenez Espriu said the public would be polled from Oct. 25 to Oct. 28 on whether the government should finish the ambitious new Mexico City airport or scrap it and upgrade a military air base to complement the existing hub. “This is going to be taken seriously. Even if there are three votes, we will take it seriously,” Jimenez said at a news conference, adding that results would be released the following week. Mexican President-elect Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who takes office on Dec. 1, has said the new airport has been tainted by corruption and will be more costly than projected. Mexican regional airport stocks GAP, OMA and ASUR fell by between 3 percent and 5 percent. The cancellation of the project would hit regional airports since 70 percent of domestic flights originate from the capital, said Alejandra Marcos at brokerage Intercam. If the project is scrapped, it would spook investors and could hit the Mexican peso and government bonds, she said. Jimenez said the airport, which has been under construction on the drained bed of Lake Texcoco on the eastern flank of Mexico City since 2015 and is around 20 to 30 percent complete, was over budget and behind schedule. He said the Texcoco airport was now projected to cost 285 billion pesos ($15 billion) compared with an original estimate of 195 billion pesos. The airport had been due to be completed during 2022, but Jimenez said it would likely take until 2024. The consultation will be held in over 500 municipalities covering about 80 percent of Mexico’s population, Jimenez said. Irrespective of the results of the survey, Jimenez said the delay in construction meant “major surgery” was required at the current airport in order to ease stretched capacity limits. The new government would invest up to 5 billion pesos to upgrade the current Mexico City airport and expand an international airport in the city of Toluca in the State of Mexico, about 34 miles (55 km) from the capital, he added. The aim is to lift capacity at the Mexico City airport from around 40 million passengers per year to 50 million and increase Toluca annual traffic from less than 4 million to 10 million."

GAP said it was chosen by the Jamaican government as a “provisional preferred bidder,” but that certain terms within the agreement were still to be defined. Once they are established, GAP will detail the terms and general conditions of the accord, it added.
