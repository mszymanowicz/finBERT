1.9829032915041573," Sierra Nevada chooses ULA's Vulcan to launch space station supply runs SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Sierra Nevada Corp, a privately owned defense contractor with spaceflight ambitions, said on Wednesday it picked United Launch Alliance’s Vulcan rocket to launch its Dream Chaser space plane on cargo missions to the International Space Station. Sierra Nevada Corp (SNC) is one of three companies hired by NASA, the U.S. space agency, to re-supply the orbiting research laboratory under a $14 billion overall award that guarantees each company a minimum of six flights between 2019 and 2024. The other companies are Elon Musk’s Space Exploration Technologies Corp, known as SpaceX, and Northrop Grumman. SNC’s Dream Chaser, which resembles the long-retired Space Shuttle, is slated to blast off from Florida’s Cape Canaveral in late 2021 aboard a Vulcan Centaur rocket being built by United Launch Alliance - a joint venture of Boeing Co and Lockheed Martin Corp. Dream Chaser will land like a conventional airplane at Florida’s Kennedy Space Center, though Sierra Nevada says it is has been developed to land on conventional airport runways. The Dream Chaser will be capable of delivering 12,000 pounds of food, water, science experiments and other cargo to the space station, the company said. In adding SNC as a contractor in 2016, NASA gave the Sparks, Nevada-based firm a major financial and public relations boost after NASA selected rival spacecraft by Boeing and SpaceX to carry astronauts between Earth and the space station. SNC, owned by Turkish immigrants and billionaires Eren Ozmen and her husband, Fatih, is part of a group of closely held companies aiming to steal market share from space industry incumbents. The company makes most of its money by modifying and integrating aviation equipment into existing aircraft and by selling drones and other technology, primarily to the U.S. Air Force. SNC declined to disclose how much it was paying ULA for the launches. SNC chose United Launch Alliance over providers from Europe, Japan and the United States, including SpaceX and Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin, Ozmen told reporters after announcing the launch agreement, confirming earlier Reuters reporting. Representatives from SpaceX and Blue Origin did not immediately respond to requests for comment. United Launch Alliance is working toward a first flight of its heavy-lift Vulcan in spring 2021, the same year Bezos aims to fly the New Glenn. United Launch Alliance could use its operational Atlas V rocket as a “backup” to launch Dream Chaser, ULA’s chief executive, Tory Bruno, told reporters. “We’re on time with Vulcan, but if something should arise, we’re going to make sure that you fly when you’re ready,” Bruno said. SNC argues that the Dream Chaser’s ability to land on a traditional runway gives it an edge over rival solutions for delicate scientific research cargo. SpaceX’s Dragon capsules currently splash down in the Pacific Ocean, while Northrop’s Cygnus capsules burn up as they fall through the atmosphere, which gives NASA an opportunity to remove trash from the station."

22.643621458190356," Boeing-Lockheed's Vulcan rocket design 'nearly fully mature' CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (Reuters) - A joint venture between Boeing Co BA.N and Lockheed Martin Corp LMT.N will conduct the final design review for its new flagship Vulcan rocket within months, it said on Wednesday, as the aerospace company heads for a showdown with Elon Musk's SpaceX and others in the launch services market. The final design review is a crucial milestone as the company, United Launch Alliance (ULA), tries to move into full production ahead of a first flight in spring 2021 after slipping from its initial 2019 timetable. “The design is nearly fully mature,” ULA systems test engineer Dane Drefke told Reuters during a tour of Space Launch Complex 41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida. The companies are vying to develop rockets to carry satellites into orbit in what the Satellite Industry Association lobby group estimates is a roughly $5.5 billion satellite launch services market. ULA has started cutting and building hardware and has begun structural and pressure testing at its Decatur, Alabama factory. Engineers were also modifying the Florida launch pad and tower to accommodate Vulcan. ULA’s legacy Atlas and Delta rockets have been synonymous with America’s space missions for decades. But the Colorado-based company has waged a cost-cutting campaign in recent years that included job cuts and trying new production methods as it faces mounting competition from SpaceX. Musk has upended the industry with reusable rocket technology that has slashed the cost of space transportation. And Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O founder Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin said last week it will fly its still-in-development New Glenn rocket in 2021 - the same year as Vulcan. While ULA’s rockets burn up during each voyage, making for reliable but costlier missions, the company is charting a strategy of returning the first-stage engine to Earth under a parachute and plucking it out of mid-air with a helicopter. ULA does not envision more job cuts and has been adding engineers in Florida and elsewhere, it said on Wednesday. “We are now optimal-sized,” Drefke said, adding that ULA will be hiring more engineers as it moves into production. The Vulcan, which will be powered partly by Blue Origin’s U.S.-built BE-4 engine, is central to ending U.S. reliance on Russia’s RD-180 engine for national security missions. ULA confirmed new purchases of at least five more RD-180s in recent months for non-military missions, like commercial satellite launches. Meanwhile, Blue Origin has hit “a few minor setbacks” during rigorous BE-4 testing but was “progressing nominally” and was expected to live up to delivery targets, Drefke said. Blue Origin did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
-12.470932182669653," Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin to supply engines for Vulcan rocket SEATTLE/ORLANDO, Fla. (Reuters) - Blue Origin, the space company founded by Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos, has won a contract to supply engines for United Launch Alliance's massive Vulcan rocket, the companies said on Thursday. While Blue Origin has been seen as the front-runner for the contract for months, the win is a significant milestone for the Seattle-area aerospace company as it vies to become a player in the market for lucrative U.S. military satellite launch contracts. Choosing Blue Origin’s made-in-America BE-4 engine for the next-generation heavy-lift Vulcan launch vehicle is part of ULA’s path to ending U.S. reliance on Russia’s RD-180 engine for national security missions. That engine currently provides the main power for ULA’s legacy workhorse, Atlas V, which the Vulcan will eventually replace. United Launch Alliance, a joint venture of aerospace stalwarts Boeing Co BA.N and Lockheed Martin Corp LMT.N, picked Blue Origin's BE-4 engine to power Vulcan's core booster over the AR1 engine put up by Aerojet Rocketdyne Holdings Inc AJRD.N. “United Launch Alliance is the premier launch service provider for national security missions, and we’re thrilled to be part of their team and that mission,” Blue Origin’s CEO, Bob Smith, said in a statement. The terms of the contract were not disclosed, but engines represent a major portion of the cost of a rocket. Aerojet Rocketdyne spokesman Steve Warren said the company was “still excited to be on team Vulcan.” Aerojet’s RL10 engine will provide power to the Vulcan rocket’s upper stage. ULA said in announcing the contract award that Vulcan was on track for an initial flight in mid-2020, though industry sources expect that deadline to be extended. Bezos is funneling $1 billion of his own fortune annually into Blue Origin as it scrambles to fly its own heavy-lift launch vehicle, dubbed New Glenn, in 2020. New Glenn will also be powered by Blue Origin’s BE-4 engine and eventually compete with ULA’s Vulcan, raising questions about the clarity of Bezos’ strategy. ""Nobody disputes that with the investment they're making they won't eventually be successful,"" Matt Desch, CEO of Iridium Communications Inc IRDM.O, told Reuters in August. ""But how and when they become reliable is still uncertain."""
