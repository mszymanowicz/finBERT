15.215511158937511," Enbridge raises Line 3 replacement cost estimate by $1.1 billion (Reuters) - Enbridge Inc on Friday forecast higher costs for its long-contested Line 3 pipeline replacement project, citing regulatory and permitting delays, winter construction and COVID-19 protocols, among other reasons. Line 3, built in the 1960s, ships crude from Alberta to U.S. Midwest refiners, and carries less oil than it was designed for because of age and corrosion. Replacing the pipeline would allow Enbridge to roughly double its capacity to 760,000 barrels per day. While the Canadian portion is complete, Enbridge has run into repeated obstacles in Minnesota, where reviews have lasted for about five years. The updated cost comes in the wake of U.S. President Joe Biden cancelling the permit needed to build TC Energy Corp’s Keystone XL oil pipeline, a blow to Canada’s oil sector. Enbridge now estimates capital costs for the Line 3 replacement project, including the Canadian segment already in service, at $8.18 billion up from $7.08 billion. The increased costs are on the U.S. portion of the pipeline. Calgary, Alberta-based Enbridge expects to put the pipeline into service in the fourth quarter. The company reported lower than expected fourth quarter earnings and said volumes on its liquids pipelines were impacted by reduced refinery demand. The COVID-19 pandemic battered fuel demand worldwide and Enbridge CEO Al Monaco said the recovery remains uncertain. “Despite positive indicators early in 2021, the pace of recovery is still unknown as COVID-19 cases remain high in many parts of the world,” he said in a statement. On an adjusted basis, Enbridge earned 56 Canadian cents per share, while analysts had expected 61 Canadian cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The company is locked in a dispute with Michigan about its aging Line 5 pipeline, and Monaco reiterated Enbridge will keep the pipeline running despite orders from the state governor to shut it down.

Enbridge’s 68-year-old Line 5 pipeline carries 540,000 barrels per day of light crude and propane, and one 4.5-mile (7.2-km) section runs underwater along the lakebed. Environmentalists concerned about the risk of a spill into the Great Lakes are trying to have the pipeline shut down, and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer has revoked its easement, a move Enbridge is fighting in federal court. The permits from Michigan’s Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy (EGLE) is a step forward for Enbridge, but the Calgary-based company still requires permits from the Michigan Public Service Commission and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to move ahead with building the tunnel. The permit decision on Friday also does not impact Whitmer’s order to shut down Line 5 operations. “Such a shutdown before the completion of the Great Lakes Tunnel Project would lead to major energy shortages in the region and severe economic consequences for Michigan, neighboring states and Canada,” Enbridge spokesman Ryan Duffy said in a statement. Oil pipeline opponents have been galvanized by new U.S. President Joe Biden issuing a raft of executive orders aimed at cutting greenhouse gas emissions, and revoking a key permit for the Keystone XL pipeline on his first day in office. Environmental groups said they were disappointed by the Line 5 tunnel permit decision, but vowed to continue campaigning. “The tunnel construction and the ongoing operation of the Line 5 pipeline will have devastating impacts all along its path throughout the Great Lakes,” said Debbie Chizewer, managing attorney of Earthjustice. “We will continue to advocate...to bring attention to the dangers posed by this project and seek denial of the remaining permits needed.” (Reporting by Nia Williams; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama, Paul Simao and Andrea Ricci)"

16.261389329889536," UPDATE 2-Enbridge seeks to block Michigan's move to shut down Line 5 (Updates with NWF comment) Nov 24 (Reuters) - Canadian pipeline operator Enbridge Inc said on Tuesday it had filed a federal complaint in the U.S. District Court seeking an injunction to stop the State of Michigan from taking any steps to prevent the operation of Line 5. The Enbridge Line 5 pipelines runs under the Straits of Mackinac, where Lakes Huron and Michigan meet, and ships 540,000 barrels per day of light crude oil and propane, serving both retail customers and refiners in Michigan and Ohio. It is a critical part of the company’s network that delivers the bulk of Canadian crude exports to the United States and eastern Canada. Michigan’s Governor Gretchen Whitmer said in November she is terminating the easement that allows Enbridge to operate its Line 5 pipelines, as the company failed to protect the U.S. Great Lakes by preventing the line from being damaged. The move would require the line to be shut by May 2021. “In the face of continued roadblocks by this Administration it’s time for the State to stop playing politics with the energy needs and anxieties of U.S. and Canadian consumers and businesses that depend on Line 5,” said Vern Yu, Enbridge’s executive vice president and president of liquids pipelines. The company added that a disruption to Line 5 would result in a daily shortage of over 14 million gallons of gasoline and other transportation fuels, impacting the entire region, including Wisconsin, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Ontario and Quebec. The National Wildlife Federation (NWF) said Enbrige’s lawsuit seeks to strip Michigan of its authority to protect the Great Lakes. “We urge the courts to reject Enbridge’s desperate, last-ditch effort to salvage its dangerous and failing pipeline,” said Mike Shriberg, NWF Great Lakes’ regional executive director."

16.261389329889536," U.S. Army Corps hands federal permits to Enbridge's Line 3 oil pipeline project (Reuters) - Canada’s Enbridge Inc said on Monday it received federal permits for its Line 3 crude pipeline replacement project from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, moving closer to building the pipeline in the United States after years of delay. Line 3, which ships crude from Canadian oil hub Alberta to U.S. Midwest refiners, currently carries less oil than was designed for because of age and corrosion. Replacing the line, built in the 1960s, would allow Calgary-based Enbridge to roughly double its capacity to 760,000 barrels per day. Line 3 is among the three major Canadian export pipelines, along with government-owned Trans Mountain and TC Energy Corp’s Keystone XL oil pipeline. Final state permits and authorizations are still needed before Line 3 work can begin, Enbridge said, adding it hopes to start construction before the end of the year. While the Canadian portion is complete, Enbridge has run into repeated obstacles in Minnesota, where reviews have lasted about five years. Earlier this month, Minnesota regulators approved key permits for Line 3, including the contested 401 Water Quality Certification, and the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources released the final eight permits. IA Securities analysts said the latest approvals continue to reinforce their assumption that the Line 3 replacement project will begin contributing financially to the company by the fourth quarter of 2021. Enbridge still requires Minnesota Pollution Control Agency to issue a final construction stormwater permit and the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission to issue the authorization to construct before it can begin work. A shortage of pipelines has hurt prices for Canadian crude oil and pushed it to trade at deep discounts compared to benchmark futures in recent years. However, steep production cuts during the COVID-19 pandemic helped free up some space this year."

A shortage of pipelines has weighed on Canadian oil prices and pushed it to trade at deep discounts compared with benchmark futures in recent years, but capacity became ample this year after steep oil production cuts during the COVID-19 pandemic. Canadian oil traders said the news was bullish for crude differentials. “This is a good thing for sure. Finally ... it’s taken years to get permits and approvals,” one trader said."

30.83272042068658," Enbridge aims to drastically cut carbon footprint as global climate pressures rise (Reuters) - Canada's largest pipeline operator Enbridge Inc ENB.TO on Friday set emissions reduction targets, hoping to be a net zero emitter of greenhouse gases by 2050, as the industry faces intense pressure from investors to limit carbon discharge. Reported greenhouse gas emissions from Canada’s oil patch have more than doubled in the first half of the year as changes to how they are measured revealed a more extensive picture of environmental damage. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government, which has set a goal of making Canada carbon neutral by 2050, launched a national program on Jan. 1 to better measure and reduce methane emissions. Enbridge, which reported a smaller-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday, said it hopes to reduce the intensity of greenhouse gas emissions by 35% by 2030. To meet the targets, the company said it would invest in lower carbon infrastructure as well as in wind and solar power generation, hydrogen and renewable natural gas. The pipeline operator earned 48 Canadian cents per share in the quarter, lower than the 53 Canadian cents analysts expected, as a coronavirus-induced slump in demand hurt the volumes transported on its mainline system. A sharp decline in global crude prices and demand destruction cause by the pandemic has battered Canada, the world’s fourth-largest crude producer, which was already facing steep discounts for its oil. Fuel demand however has picked up with the easing of restrictions, but a resurgence in COVID-19 infections could derail that recovery. Chief Executive Officer Al Monaco said he expects a gradual pace of demand recovery over the balance of 2020 and into 2021. The Calgary-based company transported 2.6 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil on its Mainline system across Canada and the United States during the quarter, down from 2.7 million bpd in the year-ago quarter."

BP, Chevron and Equinor evacuated oil workers and Royal Dutch Shell paused drilling as winds intensified to 85 mile-per-hour (136 kph). Pipeline operator Enbridge evacuated an offshore platform and on Tuesday plans to remove workers from a Louisiana natural gas processing plant. Some oil producers were pulling workers for at least the sixth time since June, a process made more difficult by the novel coronavirus pandemic with workers required to be tested for the virus before returning to work. Zeta was the third named storm this month to hit Mexico’s Quintana Roo state, forecasters said, setting a new record for the month. On Monday, it became the 11th hurricane of the Atlantic season, which on average has six. A hurricane watch was issued for parts of Louisiana to the Mississippi-Alabama border by the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC). Zeta could hit the U.S. coast on Wednesday at or near hurricane strength, the NHC said.

Enbridge’s profit was 5% lower than last year as it transported reduced oil volumes after a plunge in demand for gasoline and jet fuel, caused by pandemic-related lockdowns. In May, Enbridge deferred C$1 billion ($748 million) in capital spending as plummeting oil prices hammered the energy industry in Canada, the world’s fourth-largest crude producer. Mainline throughput was 400,000 barrels per day (bpd) lower in the second quarter sequentially. The company expects Mainline volumes to be under-utilized by 200,000 to 400,000 bpd in the third quarter and by 100,000 to 300,000 bpd in the fourth, before reaching full utilization in early 2021. The company transported 2.44 million bpd of crude on its Mainline during the quarter, down from 2.66 million bpd last year. Enbridge has run into problems on two U.S. pipelines, however. One leg of Line 5, running through a Great Lakes channel, remains shut after Enbridge detected damage in June. That leg should operate again within weeks, once a federal regulator determines it is fit for service, said Executive Vice President of Liquids Vern Yu. The Dakota Access oil pipeline, in which Enbridge is an investor, faces a possible shutdown, but the company has alternatives to move crude from North Dakota’s Bakken play, Yu said. On an adjusted per share basis, the company earned 56 Canadian cents, while analysts on average had expected 55 Canadian cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

The pipeline’s east leg will remain shut until the federal regulator, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, completes its investigations about the damage or until ordered by the court. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel has been attempting through the courts to permanently shut down the portion of the pipeline that passes through the Straits of Mackinac, fearing any leak would pollute the Great Lakes. The 67-year-old Line 5, a part of the vast North American Mainline network, travels through the Straits, which connects Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. Enbridge shut down the pipeline on June 18 following damage to the east leg, but resumed operations at the west leg after two days, until the court ordered its shutdown. The company said it plans to restart and expects the west leg operations to soon return to normal, while it conducts an inspection. The court decision will help in getting information surrounding the incident that is needed to complete an analysis of the damage, Nessel said. (bit.ly/2VDicTN) While the east leg remains shut, Wednesday’s ruling is a positive development for integrated Canadian oil companies such as Imperial Oil Ltd and Suncor Energy Inc, according to a note by Credit Suisse. Both the companies have refineries that are dependent on the pipeline.

-0.4289963713392263," Canada's Enbridge says 800 workers take voluntary buyouts (Reuters) - Enbridge Inc ENB.TO, Canada's largest pipeline operator, said on Wednesday about 800 employees have opted for voluntary buyouts, as the company tries to reduce costs to tackle the COVID-19 crisis and the global oil price shock. In an email response to Reuters, Calgary-based Enbridge said it was offering employees the option to voluntarily select early retirement, severance, leaves of absence or part-time work. “As a result of these actions, we won’t need to pursue company-wide layoffs at this time,” a company spokesperson said. Enbridge is reducing base pay across its non-union workforce, with the board of directors and CEO Al Monaco taking a 15% cut and the company’s executive vice presidents taking a 10% cut. A recent plunge in global crude prices due to a pandemic-driven drop in demand and excess supply has battered Canada, the world’s fourth-largest crude producer. Last month, Enbridge said it has deferred C$1 billion ($737.57 million) in capital spending and cut costs by C$300 million, including salary cuts and retirements.

-1.8713547787896092," Enbridge Line 3 oil pipeline replacement faces new delay over water concerns WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - A Minnesota pollution regulator said on Wednesday it will hold a public hearing this summer on Enbridge Inc’s plan to replace its Line 3 oil pipeline, adding a potential three-month delay and pushing the bulk of construction to next year. The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) said the hearing will focus on how Enbridge ENB.TO intends to protect streams and wetlands that the pipeline crosses. Replacing Line 3, a 1960s-era branch of Enbridge’s Mainline network, would allow the company to boost flow from a Canadian oil hub in Edmonton, Alberta, to Midwest refiners. A shortage of transport space has weakened Canadian oil prices in recent years, but pipeline capacity became ample this year after deep oil production cuts during the COVID-19 pandemic. MPCA granted Enbridge a draft water quality certificate in February. But during a public comment period, activist groups and indigenous bands raised concerns, leading the MPCA to schedule the hearing. One of the groups, Honor the Earth, welcomed the decision, but said it was disappointed the MPCA did not also decide to analyze potential spills. The deadline for MPCA to issue the certificate is now Nov. 14, instead of Aug. 15. In a statement, Calgary, Alberta-based Enbridge said it would work in the meantime to secure remaining permits, in order to start construction this year. Most work will now happen in 2021, it said. The Line 3 replacement may now begin service in mid to late 2021, Stifel FirstEnergy analyst Ian Gillies said. The Canadian portion is complete, but Enbridge has run into repeated obstacles in Minnesota, where review has lasted nearly five years. The hearing will needlessly delay the project at a time when Minnesota’s economy badly needs the construction jobs, said Joel Smith, an official with Laborers’International Union of North America. “This decision wastes more months rehashing the same tired arguments,” he said."

5.483793083985294," Pipeline company Enbridge posts quarterly loss, sees drop in Mainline oil volumes (Reuters) - Canadian pipeline operator Enbridge Inc ENB.NENB.TO on Thursday reported a loss for the first quarter compared with a profit a year earlier, hit by nearly C$4 billion in charges related to its investment in DCP Midstream and derivative losses. Alberta-based Enbridge said the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting decline in demand for fuel pressured its Mainline system. Throughput on the pipeline system, which can ship 3 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude from Alberta to the United States, was down about 400,000 bpd in April. It is likely to drop by an average of 400,000 to 600,000 bpd in the second quarter, as Western Canadian producers cut 1 million to 1.5 million bpd of output, Chief Executive Al Monaco said. Despite the drop, Enbridge’s volumes are underpinned by refinery demand for heavy oil, the main crude produced in Western Canada, which is holding up better than light oil, he said. A recent plunge in global crude prices due to lost demand caused by the pandemic has battered Canada, the world’s fourth-largest crude producer. Over the past few weeks, North American oil companies have announced steep output curbs, slashed spending, cut dividends and suspended buybacks in response to the price rout. Enbridge has deferred C$1 billion in capital spending and cut costs by C$300 million, including salary cuts and retirements, Monaco said. Enbridge announced C$400 million worth of asset sales, including two North America electricity and gas lines and an interest in French offshore wind projects. The company’s shares rose 5% in Toronto, as oil prices jumped. Net loss attributable to common shareholders was C$1.43 billion ($1.02 billion), or 71 Canadian cents per share, in the first quarter, compared with a profit of C$1.89 billion, or 94 Canadian cents per share a year earlier. On an adjusted per share basis, the company, however, earned 83 Canadian cents, while analysts, on average, had expected a profit of 74 Canadian cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv."

11.581913263827651," Enbridge makes deal to store Canadian crude in Mainline as oil glut grows TORONTO (Reuters) - Enbridge Inc ENB.TO said on Monday the Canadian pipeline operator has reached a deal with shippers to temporarily store crude oil in North America's largest oil pipeline network from June 1 and is working with governments to provide additional capacity. Oil companies have been slashing costs and cutting production due to a crash in crude prices and slumping fuel demand due to global restrictions to fight the novel coronavirus pandemic. This has stoked fears that global storage levels are fast approaching capacity. “Given the impacts of the pandemic and the collapse in crude oil prices, demand for incremental crude petroleum storage throughout North America and even more urgently in Western Canada is high,” the company said in a May 1 filing with the Canadian Energy Regulator. The Mainline, Canada’s longest oil pipeline system, has capacity for nearly 3 million barrels per day, moving western Canadian oil to U.S. refiners. Enbridge last month said it would not ration capacity for May on the network, a sharp reversal from restrictions that have dogged Canadian producers for years. The company is offering about 900,000 barrels of storage, equivalent to about four standard-sized tanks, for an eight-month term, a spokeswoman said. It would use an older portion of its Line 3 pipeline in Canada before the line is decommissioned next year. Enbridge is also working with provincial and the Canadian federal governments “to support producers’ goal of more storage,” spokeswoman Tracie Kenyon said in an email, without providing details. “This temporary storage, along with the further maintenance optimizations to our storage tank program will create more than two million barrels of additional storage capacity for 2020,” she said. Alberta Premier Jason Kenney has repeatedly warned that storage levels are in danger of reaching capacity. Cuts to Alberta's oil production have been large enough to avoid filling storage completely but levels could still spike to tank-top capacity of 43 million barrels, Canadian producer Cenovus Energy Inc CVE.TO said last week."

6.145410348090643," Enbridge will not ration Mainline as coronavirus restrictions shred oil demand TORONTO/WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - Pipeline operator Enbridge Inc said on Monday it would not ration capacity for May on North America’s biggest oil pipeline network, as Canada’s oil producers deepen production cuts to cope with low prices and weak demand. The notice by Enbridge for its Mainline pipeline is the latest sign of dislocation in Canada’s hard-hit energy sector as producers scramble to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has severely cut fuel demand and led refiners to reduce purchases of crude. Constraints on major export pipelines have plagued the Canadian industry for years, leading to steep price discounts for the country’s heavy crude against U.S. West Texas intermediate oil. Canada’s oil sands producers have cut an estimated 300,000 barrels per day (bpd) of mostly steam-driven output and more reductions are expected, as travel restrictions and lockdowns in major cities shred North American oil demand. “Refiners are starting to kick back production. They can’t take any more,” said Grant Fagerheim, CEO of Whitecap Resources Inc. “There may be (pipeline) capacity but you have no end user to buy your oil.” Enbridge’s mainline has capacity for 3 million barrels a day, moving Western Canadian oil to U.S. refiners. The pipeline has been regularly oversubscribed in recent years, forcing Enbridge to ration the number of barrels each shipper can move. Those constraints are easing as producers turn down production. Enbridge said earlier this month it was running the Mainline with unused capacity and that some 20% to 25% of Western Canada’s oil production could be shut in during the second quarter. Lower than expected Mainline volumes could weigh on near-term share performance for Enbridge, said BMO analyst Ben Pham in a note last week. He expects second-quarter Mainline volumes to drop 450,000 bpd, assuming production shut-ins of 1 million to 1.5 million bpd. The total impact to Mainline EBITDA could be C$400 million ($283 million) for the first and second quarters, analysts at Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co said in a Monday note. Enbridge shares are down about 20% so far this year, while the benchmark Canada share index is down about 16%."

8.414324106260345," Enbridge running Mainline with unused space as Canada oil cuts deepen WINNIPEG, Manitoba/TORONTO (Reuters) - Enbridge Inc ENB.TO is running North America's biggest oil pipeline network, the Mainline, with unused capacity as Canadian producers cut output because of the spread of the coronavirus and low prices, a senior executive said on Monday. The spare capacity points to mounting distress for the western Canadian province of Alberta and its already strapped energy industry as measures to contain the fast-spreading respiratory virus pummel North American oil demand. “Right now we’re going to see as much production turned down as possible in western Canada,” Vern Yu, Enbridge’s executive vice president of liquids pipelines, said in an interview. He declined to say how much space the Mainline had, but Alberta Premier Jason Kenney said last week it was running with 150,000 barrels per day of unused room. Canada, the world’s fourth-largest crude producer, could curtail as much as 1.7 million barrels per day, or a third of the country’s total output, as U.S. refineries idle capacity and rising production tests storage limits, according to Royal Bank of Canada analysts. The Mainline, Canada’s longest oil pipeline system, has capacity for nearly 3 million barrels per day, moving western Canadian oil to U.S. refiners. Enbridge plans to sell 90% of the Mainline’s space under long-term contracts to shippers rather than continue to ration space monthly. The move, intended to take effect in mid-2021, requires approval from the Canada Energy Regulator (CER). Enbridge has said 13 shippers, mainly those with U.S. refineries, representing 70% of current Mainline volume, support its proposal. Despite the oil market collapse, Yu said Enbridge had received no requests from customers to revisit shipping terms and the process remained on track. Canadian Natural Resources Ltd CNQ.TO, MEG Energy Corp MEG.TO and other major producers have asked the regulator, however, to postpone any hearings on the switch to firm contracts, citing strain on the industry caused by the coronavirus pandemic, a CER spokeswoman said. Yu said in February the best-case scenario for its proposed Line 3 replacement project was to obtain all permits needed in Minnesota in time to start construction in summer. Construction of the long-delayed Line 3, which is part of the Mainline, would take six to nine months, he said. “We’ll have to reassess once we have the permits on what’s a reasonable construction time frame given what may or may not be there as far as physical distancing restrictions,” he said on Monday."

The pipeline operated by Enbridge subsidiary Westcoast Energy Inc ruptured on Oct. 9, 2018, in a forested area near Prince George. No one was injured, but the blast led to the evacuation of 125 people, including from the Lheidli T’enneh First Nation. Police photos from a helicopter showed a nine-meter-deep crater and dozens of scorched evergreen trees at the site. The temporary shutdown of the line, which carries gas destined for the Pacific Northwest, led to disruptions for refineries owned by Royal Dutch Shell and Phillips 66 in the U.S. state of Washington. The TSB said in a report that polyethylene tape used to protect the pipeline’s surface had deteriorated, allowing moisture underneath and corrosion to develop. Stress on the pipeline that was caused by normal operations, combined with the corrosion, created the cracks, in a phenomenon known as “stress corrosion cracking,” said TSB senior investigator Jennifer Philopoulos. The board, an independent agency that reports to Parliament, said it had investigated three other ruptures since 2002 with a similar cause, all on TC Energy lines. That section of line was last inspected 10 years before the blast, and was scheduled for inspection the week the incident occurred, said Michele Harradence, Enbridge’s senior vice-president of gas transmission and midstream. “These are very stressful things to occur in your community and we apologize for that,” Harradence said in an interview from Houston, Texas. Enbridge has since begun integrity assessments of all its gas pipelines in North America, adopted newer tools to detect problems, expanded inspection criteria and increased scheduled excavations to examine pipelines, she said.

-26.034332314334378," Canada's Enbridge stands by plan to sell capacity on Mainline, awaits regulator nod (Reuters) - Enbridge Inc ENB.TO on Friday once again defended its decision to contract capacity on its Mainline system and said it would move forward with an open season to solicit bids if the pipeline operator wins necessary approval. The company plans to sell 90% of space under long-term contracts to shippers on the nearly 3 million barrels-per-day (bpd) Mainline, instead of continuing the older practice of rationing space monthly. With congested pipelines, some oil producers worry that Enbridge’s changes will further limit access. After two years of negotiations and changes to the contract, Enbridge has landed on a very good balance of benefits for everybody, including producers, integrated companies and refiners, Chief Executive Officer Al Monaco said on a conference call with analysts. Earlier on Friday, Enbridge posted a quarterly profit that fell short of analysts’ estimates, hit by weaker earnings at its energy services unit and liquids pipeline segment, sending its shares down more than 1%. The energy services unit, which provides marketing services to North American refiners and producers among others, swung to a loss of C$22 million ($16.60 million). Enbridge transported 1.6% more crude on its Mainline system during the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, however adjusted core earnings from Canada’s longest pipeline fell 3.7%. The headline EBITDA miss may cause some concern given robust equity outperformance, however the company hit full-year guidance and attractive defensive characteristics remain apparent, wrote analysts at Tudor Pickering Holt & Co. Pipeline operators in Canada have faced strong opposition from environmental and indigenous groups, which has stalled some new pipeline projects at a time when rising production is already pressurizing existing infrastructure. Enbridge has been trying to get approvals for its Line 3 project that would replace an aging pipeline from Alberta to Superior, Wisconsin, allowing it to double capacity to 760,000 bpd.

-23.355326582421085," Canada's Enbridge fears year-long delay to Mainline change from CNRL WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - Canada's biggest pipeline company, Enbridge Inc ENB.TO, fired back on Friday at the country's largest oil producer, saying Canadian Natural Resources' CNQ.TO suggestions for determining future terms on the Mainline would cause at least a one-year delay. Enbridge plans to sell 90% of space under long-term contracts to shippers on the nearly 3 million barrel per day Mainline, Canada’s longest oil pipeline system, rather than continue to ration space monthly. Canadian pipelines are congested, and some oil producers worry that Enbridge’s changes will further limit access. CNRL told the Canada Energy Regulator (CER) last week that it should first consider whether Enbridge should be allowed at all to convert the Mainline from common carrier status, before it examines other issues. Breaking up the regulatory process into parts would drag it out by at least a year, and push the Mainline open season - the period for shippers to bid on space - to 2022, Enbridge said in a CER filing on Friday. Enbridge wants the new Mainline contracts to take effect in mid-2021. “Such delay might benefit CNRL by providing more time for it to sort out its transportation options,” Enbridge said in its filing, noting expansions planned for the rival Trans Mountain and Keystone XL pipelines. “But the conclusion of the regulatory process should not be delayed to suit the commercial interests of CNRL.” Terms of the Mainline change are an effort to suit most of the shippers who currently use it, Vern Yu, Enbridge’s executive vice-president of liquids pipelines, said in an interview. Thirteen shippers representing 70% of current Mainline volume support Enbridge's proposal, Yu said. They include Canadian producers Cenovus Energy Inc CVE.TO and Imperial Oil Ltd IMO.TO, but the list is made up mostly of U.S. refiners. Imperial and Cenovus also own refineries in whole or part. A CNRL spokeswoman could not be immediately reached. CNRL noted in its letter last week that changing the Mainline’s common carrier status is unprecedented and carried “potential harm” to Canadian oil producers. Meanwhile, Yu said the best-case scenario for its proposed Line 3 replacement project is to obtain all permits needed in Minnesota in time to start construction in summer. Construction of the long-delayed Line 3, which is part of the Mainline, would take six to nine months, he said."

-25.630882776140112," Enbridge Line 3 oil pipeline clears hurdles with Minnesota regulator WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - Enbridge Inc’s Line 3 pipeline replacement cleared important hurdles on Monday when a Minnesota regulator endorsed a revised environmental impact statement for the project. The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission’s decision, followed by its approval of a certificate of need and route permit, is a victory for Canadian oil producers, who have been forced to curtail production in Alberta because of a shortage of pipeline capacity. Enbridge shares jumped 1.5%, hitting their highest level since May 2017. Line 3, built in the 1960s, carries oil from Alberta to Superior, Wisconsin. It carries less oil than it was designed for because of age and corrosion. “Instead of a 50-plus year-old pipeline with known integrity issues, a new pipeline would replace it,” Enbridge lawyer Eric Swanson said. Line 3’s opponents, however, questioned the need for replacing the pipeline amid concerns about fossil fuels. “If Enbridge is talking about an integrity problem, shut it down,” Joe Plummer, representing the Red Lake Band of Chippewa Indians, told the commission. Replacing Line 3 would allow Calgary, Alberta-based Enbridge to double capacity to 760,000 barrels per day. “This (decision) is critically important because when we get that extra shipment capacity we should be able to keep our energy market in balance,” Alberta Premier Jason Kenney said on Twitter. The Minnesota Department of Commerce revised its environmental impact statement for Line 3 after the Minnesota Court of Appeal ruled last June that the original statement was insufficient regarding a single issue - assessment of a potential spill on Lake Superior and its watershed. The department opposed issuing a certificate of need, however, saying Enbridge had not provided a forecast for energy demand as required. A spill would be “catastrophic” to the Leech Lake Band of Ojibwe indigenous community, including its wild rice harvesting, said Benjamin Benoit, the group’s environmental director. Oil can also spill if it travels by rail, the main alternative to pipelines, said Kevin Pranis, a spokesman for Laborers International Union of North America, which supports the project because of the jobs it would create. Line 3 still requires various permits and its opponents are expected to formally petition the Minnesota commission to reconsider its decisions. The Sierra Club said in a statement that it would continue to fight Line 3 alongside other groups. The project is one of three, along with TC Energy Corp’s Keystone XL and the Canadian government-owned Trans Mountain, that have been stalled for years by opposition."

The Canadian pipeline operator recently withdrew its proposal for a facility capable of handling supertankers, U.S. maritime officials said this week, taking the project out of the current race to export U.S. shale. Enbridge last month said it would jointly develop a deepwater facility with Enterprise Products Partners LP, whose project had already been advanced by long-term agreements with oil major Chevron Corp. “Enbridge will consider re-filing the application in the future should market demand for additional export capacity grow in the future,” spokesman Devin Hotzel said in an email.

Enbridge plans to allow shippers to book 90% of space under long-term contracts on the nearly 3 million barrel per day Mainline, Canada’s biggest oil pipeline system, rather than continue to ration space on a monthly basis. The move comes as existing Canadian pipelines are congested, and the oil industry struggles to win regulatory or legal approval to expand them over environmental opposition. Unlike when Enbridge made its first such proposal, the regulator is requiring that Enbridge delay open season - the period when it auctions off space - until after the CER approves of the terms, Enbridge’s executive vice president of liquids pipelines, Guy Jarvis, told reporters on a conference call. “We believe the approach we’ve proposed is the gold standard to allowing all participants to participate,” Jarvis said. The company filed letters of support from 12 shippers representing 70% of the current Mainline volume. They include Canadian producers Cenovus Energy Inc and Imperial Oil Ltd, but the list is made up mostly of U.S. refiners who buy Canadian crude such as BP Plc and PBF Energy. In an unusual move, the CER halted Enbridge’s open season in September, after Canadian producers complained that Enbridge had too much market power and that U.S. refiners could book most of the Mainline’s space under the new system. If approved, the new contract system would take effect once the existing framework expires in mid-2021.

Enbridge said in November it planned to seek the Canada Energy Regulator’s approval to auction off rights to ship crude on its Mainline system, more than a month after the watchdog said the company will not be allowed to offer contracted space on the pipeline to shippers. Canada holds the world’s third-largest crude reserves but years of regulatory delays and environmental opposition have stymied development of new export pipelines, contributing to falling capital investment and slowing growth in the oil sands. The company said it expects earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of C$13.7 billion ($10.30 billion) next year, compared with its 2019 forecast of C$13 billion, partly helped by its Line 3 going into service in Canada. The Canadian segment of the Line 3 Replacement project was placed into service earlier this month. Line 3 is part of Enbridge’s Mainline network that transports western Canadian oil to Midwest refineries and the replacement project would double capacity to 760,000 barrels per day. Enbridge, which has been selling non-core assets and simplifying its corporate structure to cut costs, had reported better-than-expected third quarter profit in November due to higher crude volumes on its Mainline system. Enbridge declared a quarterly dividend of C$0.81 per share for 2020, up 9.8% from this year.

The revised statement was drafted at the request of the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (PUC). A court had determined the previous environmental assessment was inadequate. The commerce department’s spill modeling showed that oil from a spill would not reach the lake, Enbridge said. The finding helps Enbridge’s chances of gaining final approval for the project from the Minnesota regulator and complete replacement of a pipeline built in the 1960s. The line moves crude from the Canadian province of Alberta to U.S. refineries, and replacing it would boost a Canadian oil industry that has struggled due to severe bottlenecks. The project would double capacity to 760,000 barrels per day. Minnesota is the last link of Line 3 to be replaced, with the new Canadian portion opening this month. “The PUC has produced yet another inadequate review that fails to recognize that this pipeline would pose an unacceptable risk to Minnesota’s clean water and should never be built,” said Margaret Levin, a director with the Sierra Club environmental activist group.

The pipeline operators plan to finalize a deal that would provide Enbridge an option to purchase ownership interest in Enterprise’s Sea Port Oil Terminal (SPOT), subject to SPOT receiving a deepwater port license, Enbridge said. Enterprise and Enbridge were previously rivals in a field of at least nine competing to build deepwater export projects to load U.S. shale oil onto Very Large Crude Carriers (VLCCs) that carry around 2 million barrels apiece. Enterprise in late July announced it had signed long-term agreements with oil major Chevron Corp that advanced the project. It was the first company - and is still the only one - to make a final investment decision on a proposed U.S. deepwater port. Enterprise expects to receive a deepwater port license in the second half of 2020, with construction taking about two years, spokesman Rick Rainey said. In October, U.S. maritime officials resumed a licensing review of the proposed SPOT facility after a five-month pause to collect additional information. Enbridge did not respond to requests for comment. Rivals racing to develop similar projects include U.S. refiner Phillips 66, commodities trader Trafigura AG and privately held Sentinel Midstream LLC. Carlyle Group said in October it had dropped out of a $1 billion crude export terminal near Corpus Christi, Texas. The Enterprise-Enbridge partnership comes a few weeks after the companies announced an open season to solicit shipper commitments for a 200,000 barrel-per-day expansion on their jointly owned Seaway pipeline system, which carries crude from the main U.S. storage hub in Cushing, Oklahoma, to U.S. refiners. A jointly developed deepwater facility would open a direct route for U.S. crude exports from Cushing for barrels produced in Canada and midwestern U.S. fields including in the Rockies and the Anadarko basin of Oklahoma, said Sandy Fielden, an analyst at Morningstar. Enterprise “now has the momentum to get the first buoy done,” Fielden said. Currently, only the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port (LOOP) can fully load VLCCs from the Gulf Coast."

In a highly unusual move, the regulator halted the auction after major producers in the country protested Enbridge’s plans to switch to longer-term contracts from monthly allocation. Enbridge, which also reported better-than-expected third quarter profit on Friday, said it expects to place the Canadian portion of the Line 3 replacement into service on Dec.1 after delays due to tribal and environmental challenges. Line 3 is part of Enbridge’s Mainline network that transports western Canadian oil to Midwest refineries and the replacement project would double capacity to 760,000 barrels per day, providing much-needed relief from congestion on existing Canadian pipelines. The company had earlier reached a deal with crude shippers for an additional charge till the U.S. portion of the Line 3 oil pipeline is completed. The company also said on Friday it expects several of its growth projects to be operational in 2019, including the $700-million Gray Oak pipeline - the biggest of three new pipelines connecting the U.S. Permian basin to the Texas Gulf Coast. Canada’s oil producers are desperate for new export pipelines as rising production and tight capacity on existing pipelines and rail have led to the Alberta government curtailing output.

13.329937938545097," Enbridge wins court backing to keep Great Lakes pipeline running (Reuters) - Canadian pipeline operator Enbridge Inc on Thursday won backing from a Michigan state court to permit a 66-year-old crude oil pipeline to continue to run under a state waterway, pushing back authorities’ efforts to have the pipeline decommissioned. The Enbridge Line 5 pipeline runs under the Straits of Mackinac, where Lakes Huron and Michigan meet, and ships 540,000 barrels per day of light crude oil and propane. It is a critical part of the company’s network that delivers the bulk of Canadian crude exports to the United States and eastern Canada. Judge Michael Kelly ruled the law that approved a deal between Enbridge and the former Governor Rick Snyder was valid. The agreement authorized a tunnel under the Straits of Mackinac to house the existing pipelines, rather than have to move the pipelines as opponents wanted. “We continue to believe the tunnel is the best solution for Michigan and that Line 5 can continue to be safely operate during the period while the tunnel is being constructed. And we are committed to build it,” Enbridge said in a statement. A portion of the line that runs under Michigan waters has long been a bone of contention between Enbridge and state officials, who argue a leak from the twin pipelines would cause catastrophic environmental damage to the Great Lakes. The U.S. state sued Enbridge in Ingham County Circuit Court in June and asked the court to find that company’s continued operation of the pipelines under an easement granted in 1953 violates the public trust doctrine. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said the state would appeal the court’s decision. “The State of Michigan will not rely on a foreign corporation to protect and preserve our state’s most precious resource, its Great Lakes,” Nessel said in a statement."

11.422119140548508," Canada regulator orders Enbridge to halt pipeline overhaul plan due to 'perception of abuse' CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - The Canada Energy Regulator on Friday stopped Enbridge Inc from auctioning the right to send crude oil through its Mainline pipeline system due to the “perception of abuse of Enbridge’s market power.” Major producers in Canada, including Suncor Energy, have been protesting Enbridge’s plans to switch to longer-term contracts from monthly agreements. They and smaller producers complain that Enbridge’s position as the dominant pipeline company in Canada, where oil producers have been forced to cut output due to a lack of shipping capacity, gave them too much power. In a highly unusual decision, the regulator agreed, saying Enbridge will not be allowed to offer contracted space on the Mainline to shippers until the regulator approves of the terms. Typically the regulator approves or denies a pipeline tolling application after the bidding has finished. The CER noted Enbridge’s control of much of the pipelines out of western Canada, the lack of alternatives for oil shippers and the “considerable opposition” to the open season. “The Commission has concerns regarding the fairness of Enbridge’s open season process and the perception of abuse of Enbridge’s market power,” the CER said. The nearly 3 million barrel-per-day Mainline is North America’s largest pipeline system and carries the bulk of Canadian crude exports to the United States. A number of producers, including Canadian Natural Resources Ltd and Suncor, wrote to the CER in August, urging the regulator to intervene and protesting the conditions offered by Enbridge. Jackie Forrest, director of research at the ARC Energy Institute, welcomed the “unprecedented” decision given the scale of producer opposition to Enbridge’s plan. “These were very unique circumstances where you had producers who represented 2.7 million bpd of production very concerned that the proposal did not meet regulatory requirements for open access,” she said. Calgary-based Enbridge negotiated with shippers for commitments on Mainline for 18 months before launching a two-month bidding period in August. “Enbridge remains committed to moving ahead with contract carriage on the Mainline and has strong support for our offering. We will evaluate this decision and the next steps that we will take towards implementing contract carriage,” Enbridge spokesman Jesse Semko said in a statement. Canadian producers Cenovus Energy and Imperial Oil, as well as some large U.S. refiners, spoke out in favor of the Mainline overhaul, arguing it would give more certainty on shipping capacity. Canada holds the world’s third-largest crude reserves but years of regulatory delays and environmental opposition have stymied development of new export pipelines, contributing to falling capital investment and slowing growth in the oil sands. This year the government of Alberta, Canada’s main oil-producing province, introduced production curtailments to ease congestion on pipelines. Industry sources said the decision was a blow to Enbridge, but not entirely surprising given the scale of opposition to the Mainline overhaul. “Back to the drawing board for them,” one trading source said."

13.478202455410331," Enbridge receives permit for Michigan underwater supports on Line 5 oil pipeline CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Canadian company Enbridge Inc ENB.TO said on Tuesday it had received a permit from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to install 54 steel supports along its underwater Line 5 pipeline in Michigan's Straits of Mackinac. Line 5 ships 540,000 barrels per day of light crude oil and propane and is a critical part of Enbridge’s Mainline network, which delivers the bulk of Canadian crude exports to the United States. It has attracted fierce opposition from many environmental campaigners, who fear the underwater portion of the 66-year-old pipeline could leak oil into the Great Lakes. The state of Michigan is suing Enbridge in a bid to have the underwater portion of Line 5 shut down and decommissioned and has rejected Enbridge’s suggestion that it build a tunnel under the Straits to house the pipeline. In August Enbridge identified a span, or gap between the pipe and the lakebed, exceeding 75 feet, which under easements granted by the state of Michigan is the limit for each span. Company spokesman Ryan Duffy said Enbridge had been waiting 17 months for the permits and upon receiving them started work immediately to install a support at that span. Work on that section is expected to be completed later this week, weather permitting, and the other steel supports will be placed at different locations along the pipeline. “Enbridge believes that the tunnel project is the best long-term solution for Line 5 moving forward. Placing the pipeline inside a tunnel, 100 feet below the lakebed, would eliminate any span issues, and the need for supports,” Duffy said in an emailed statement. The Michigan Attorney General’s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
12.645894825340283," Minnesota court rejects challenges to Enbridge Line 3 pipeline approval CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - The Minnesota Supreme Court declined on Tuesday to hear environmental and tribal challenges to Enbridge Inc’s Line 3 oil pipeline, a decision that removes one potential obstacle for the already-delayed project. The ruling means the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC), the state regulator that approved the Line 3 project last year, will not have to consider additional environmental issues. Line 3 is part of Enbridge’s Mainline network that transports western Canadian oil to Midwest refineries. The replacement project would double capacity to 760,000 barrels per day, providing much-needed relief from congestion on existing Canadian pipelines. Pipelines carrying Canadian oil have fallen short for years of meeting demand because of delays with Line 3, the Canadian government-owned Trans Mountain and TC Energy Corp’s Keystone XL. Line 3 was meant to be in service by the end of this year but has been delayed until the second half of 2020 because of issues with permitting. “We agree with this decision from the Minnesota Supreme Court which now allows the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission to move forth with the permitting process for the Line 3 replacement,” said Guy Jarvis, Enbridge’s executive vice president of liquids pipelines. “We look forward to the MPUC providing their guidance on the remaining process and schedule.” The American Petroleum Institute also welcomed the court’s decision. Erin Roth, executive director of API Minnesota, said Line 3 was the “most studied pipeline project in state history.” In June, the Minnesota Court of Appeals ruled that the Public Utilities Commission had failed to address how an oil spill from the line would affect Lake Superior within the project’s environmental impact statement. Groups including Honor the Earth and the Mille Lac Band of Ojibwe that oppose replacement of Line 3, which was built in the 1960s, petitioned for the state Supreme Court to review other aspects of the impact statement that the appeals court approved. Those petitions were denied on Tuesday. “We are profoundly disappointed that the Minnesota Supreme Court felt more interested in siding with the rights of a Canadian corporation to proceed with a high-risk project than protecting the rights of the Minnesota Anishinabe and indigenous people and the rights of nature,” Winona LaDuke, executive director of Honor the Earth, said. Calgary-based Enbridge’s shares closed up 0.15% on the Toronto Stock Exchange at C$46.70."

12.781008331470503," Enbridge urges Canadian regulator to avoid intervening in pipeline plan CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Enbridge Inc called on Canada’s energy regulator on Wednesday to ignore calls from some of its shippers and avoid intervening in the pipeline company’s contentious proposal to revamp contracts on its Mainline network. The written submission to the Canada Energy Regulator (CER) is the latest salvo in a dispute between Calgary-based Enbridge and some of Canada’s biggest oil companies over the future of the Mainline network. The Mainline is North America’s biggest pipeline system and ships the bulk of Canadian crude exports to the United States. It currently allocates capacity according to monthly nominations from shippers, and Enbridge is proposing to switch to long-term fixed-volume contracts on 90% of the pipeline. Enbridge launched a two-month open season to solicit bids for committed capacity on Aug. 2 but shippers including Canadian Natural Resources Ltd and Suncor Energy complained the terms and tolls on offer were unfair and urged the regulator to intervene in the open season. The CER agreed to hold a fast-track process to gather comment. Last week 33 interested parties including the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers waded into the dispute, laying out their support or opposition to Enbridge’s plans. In its answering letter, Enbridge said the CER should avoid taking the unprecedented step of intervening in a pipeline open season. Instead the CER should stick to the usual practice of holding a regulatory review of the terms and tolls offered, once Enbridge makes a formal application at the end of the year. By intervening early “this process would delay business, impose considerable regulatory burden on all parties, and require the regulator to micro-manage service offerings,” Enbridge said in the letter. Enbridge also argued the regulator had no authority to halt the open season, as some shippers have called for. The pipeline company said it had tried to “strike a balance” between its own position and the different positions of stakeholders, some of whom had asked for the Mainline to switch to firm service contracts to give more certainty on capacity and tolls. Referring to last week’s submissions to the CER, Enbridge said companies that filed letters in support of their proposal ship approximately 30% of crude volumes on the Mainline, while those that filed letters in opposition made up 20% of volumes."
12.781008331470503," Enbridge investors cheer Mainline overhaul despite Canadian producer protests CALGARY, Alberta/WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - Enbridge Inc’s plan to overhaul contracts on its Mainline pipeline system has outraged many Canadian shippers but is cheered by investors who see monetizing existing infrastructure as a safer bet than trying to build new pipelines. The Mainline is North America’s largest pipeline network, transporting nearly 3 million barrels per day, or 70%, of crude from western Canada to the U.S. Midwest. Many shippers opposed say Enbridge is abusing its market power and the changes will hurt Canadian producers by imposing unfair terms and tolls. The proposed revamp comes at a time when export pipeline capacity is so constrained the Alberta government has curtailed production to support crude prices. Regulatory hurdles and well-organized environmental opposition are clogging up North American pipeline projects. Enbridge is facing U.S. court challenges on its aging Line 3 and Line 5 pipelines, and delays dog the proposed government-owned Trans Mountain expansion and TC Energy’s Keystone XL. Contracting out the Mainline would be a smart move to lock in revenue while the Trans Mountain (TMX) and Keystone XL (KXL) projects are still uncertain, investors said. If those projects go ahead and the Mainline remains a so-called “common carrier” system relying on monthly nominations, it could see volumes dip. “Under scenarios in which KXL is going to be built and TMX, the Mainline is going to be the pipe of last resort,” said Ryan Bushell, president of Newhaven Asset Management, which holds shares in Enbridge and Canadian Natural Resources Ltd. “Given how hard it is getting (new pipelines) done, Enbridge should be able to contract the Mainline out as they see fit.” Enbridge proposes switching to long-term fixed-volume contracts instead of monthly nominations on 90% of Mainline capacity in 2021 when its current tolling arrangement expires. The Mainline contributes 30% of Enbridge’s adjusted earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization, according to the latest quarterly report. “We are confident that Mainline contracting is supported by shippers representing a majority of our volumes,” Enbridge spokesman Jesse Semko said, adding the company makes decisions in the best interest of customers and shareholders. The company launched a two-month open season to solicit bids for capacity on Aug. 2. Since then, some of Canada’s biggest producers, including Canadian Natural and Suncor Energy, have complained about the plan and dozens of shippers wrote to the Canada Energy Regulator (CER) last week about whether it should intervene in the open season. Some shippers argue the Mainline should remain a common carrier pipeline open to all customers, as legislated in Canada’s 1949 Pipelines Act. Other shippers and investors say it is Enbridge’s asset to monetize as it wants. A number of investors also own shares in Canadian oil producers. “If you’re Enbridge, why wouldn’t you try to make this as profitable for you as possible? I’m rooting for (any compromise) to be bended toward Enbridge, just because it’s relatively more important to them,” said Bruce Campbell, chairman of Campbell, Lee & Ross, which holds Enbridge and Suncor. Enbridge has already lowered oil-shipping requirements on the Mainline contracts by two-thirds. The move came after smaller producers complained they would struggle to meet the initial volume requirements. Enbridge shares have gained 8% year-to-date, and Newhaven’s Bushell said they would be stronger if not for ongoing uncertainty about Line 3 and Line 5 legal challenges. Rival TC Energy is up 39% over the same period. GMP FirstEnergy analysts said so far the dispute over the Mainline changes had not impacted Enbridge stocks. “When you’re investing in a utility, you’re looking for contracted revenue and therefore contracted cash flow. As an investor from the Enbridge perspective, we like it,” said Stephen Kallir, vice-president of investments at BlueSky Equities."
14.562170082211049," UPDATE 1-Oil shippers weigh in on Enbridge's proposed overhaul of pipeline contracts (Adds Enbridge comment) CALGARY, Alberta, Sept 5 (Reuters) - More than two dozen oil companies have weighed in on whether Canada’s energy regulator should intervene in Enbridge Inc’s contentious proposal to overhaul shipping contracts on its Mainline pipeline network. The Mainline is North America’s largest pipeline system, shipping around 3 million barrels per day of crude from western Canada to the U.S. Midwest. Enbridge currently allocates capacity based on monthly nominations from shippers, but is proposing to switch to long-term fixed-volume contracts. The company launched a two-month open season to solicit bids for space on Aug. 2. It faces stiff opposition from many Canadian producers, who say the tolls are unfair and the changes will limit their access to markets. After complaints from companies, including Suncor Energy and Canadian Natural Resources Ltd, the Canada Energy Regulator (CER) said it would hold a fast-track process to gather comment and gave interested parties a deadline of 12 p.m. local time on Thursday. Most written responses came from parties in favor of the regulator intervening before the end of the open season. They included MEG Energy Corp, the Saskatchewan government and the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers (CAPP). The CER requested comment on whether it should consider the terms and tolls offered by Enbridge before - instead of after - the end of the open season, and whether the open season should be delayed. CAPP underlined the importance of the Mainline system to Canadian producers. “The conversion of the Mainline ... is no small thing and it should perhaps be no surprise and certainly no shame to anyone if the attempt to achieve the conversion by confidential negotiations and an open season turned out to be insufficient to the magnitude of the task,” Nick Schultz, CAPP’s vice president of pipeline regulation, said in a letter. Enbridge has been negotiating with shippers since last year but the terms and tolls on offer have not been publicly disclosed. The company has until Sept. 11 to file comment with the CER and welcomed the letters of support for its Mainline proposal from a number of shippers. “We are pleased that a range of customers have submitted letters to the CER today in support of what we are doing,” said Guy Jarvis, Enbridge’s executive vice president of liquids pipelines. Companies opposed to any intervention by the CER include refiners Marathon Petroleum Corp and Motiva Enterprises . Oil sands producers Cenovus Energy and Imperial Oil , which is majority-owned by ExxonMobil Corp, also supported the Mainline changes. “Cenovus is in favor of contract carriage or firm service on the Enbridge Mainline.

15.225571784631473," Enbridge reaches agreement with shippers for Line 3 pipeline placement in Canada Aug 30 (Reuters) - Enbridge Inc on Friday said it reached an agreement with shippers to place the Canadian portion of the Line 3 replacement pipeline into service by the end of this year. Enbridge will be filing a tariff with the Canadian energy regulator for a temporary surcharge with a proposed effective date of Dec. 1, 2019, the pipeline operator said in a statement. The Line 3 replacement line is on schedule for the Canadian portion and once complete, the line will carry 760,000 barrels per day of western Canadian crude to U.S. markets. Earlier in March, the company said the in-service date would be delayed by almost a year until the second half of 2020 because of slower-than-expected permitting in the U.S. state of Minnesota."
17.032659393642422," Canada's energy regulator to consider delay to Enbridge pipeline plan CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Canada’s energy regulator on Tuesday responded to shipper complaints about Enbridge Inc’s plan to switch to fixed contracts on its Mainline pipeline network by announcing a fast-track process to gather comment on the proposal that could lead to its being delayed. The unusual move from the Canadian Energy Regulator (CER), which was until this week known as the National Energy Board (NEB), comes after a slew of letters from companies including Canadian Natural Resources Ltd and Suncor Energy asking the regulator to intervene. Enbridge is proposing to switch to long-term, fixed-volume contracts on 90% of the Mainline, which is North America’s largest oil pipeline network and ships the bulk of Canadian crude exports to the United States. Currently space is allocated on a monthly basis. Calgary-based Enbridge launched a two-month open season on Aug. 2 to solicit bids for committed capacity on the Mainline, a process that some producers have said should be delayed until the regulator approves the terms and tolls on offer. Typically a pipeline company would apply to the regulator for approval after an open season finishes. In a letter the CER said it will establish a fast-track process to gather comment from all interested persons by the middle of next month. The regulator is asking for comments addressing whether an open season should be held before or after the regulator considers the terms, conditions and tolls set by Enbridge. They should also address whether the CER has the authority to delay the open season. ConocoPhillips Canada, MEG Energy Corp, Royal Dutch Shell Plc, Japan Canada Oil Sands Ltd (JACOS) and the Explorers and Producers Association of Canada have all written to the regulator expressing concerns about the planned Mainline changes. “Enbridge does not agree with the assertions in the letters filed by these parties to the NEB. We have significant support for the open season offering and we look forward to responding as part of the process outlined by the NEB,” Guy Jarvis, Enbridge’s executive vice president of liquids pipelines, said in a statement. Canadian shippers have complained the switch to fixed contracts would enable U.S. refiners downstream to secure most of the Mainline capacity, and tie producers into delivering crude to the Midwest region at the expense of other markets. “Enbridge’s proposal is completely inappropriate, and is being made at a time when considerable market power imbalance exists because of the shortage of pipeline capacity leaving the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin,” Canadian Natural President Tim McKay said in the letter. Canada is the world’s fourth-largest crude producer, but congestion on existing export pipelines and delays building new ones have led to deep price discounts, prompting Alberta’s provincial government to impose mandatory production curtailments."

Canadian Natural’s letter to the National Energy Board (NEB), filed late on Monday, calls on the regulator to delay Enbridge’s proposal to switch to long-term, fixed-volume contracts on 90% of the Mainline. Suncor Energy, MEG Energy, Royal Dutch Shell, Japan Canada Oil Sands Ltd (JACOS) and the Explorers and Producers Association of Canada have also written to the regulator expressing concerns about the planned changes. Enbridge launched a two-month open season on Aug. 2 to solicit bids for capacity on the Mainline, which carries 2.85 million barrels per day of Canadian crude and is the largest export conduit to the United States. Capacity is currently allocated on a monthly basis. Canadian shippers have complained the switch to fixed contracts would enable U.S. refiners downstream to secure most of the Mainline capacity, and tie producers into delivering crude to the Midwest region at the expense of other markets. “Enbridge’s proposal is completely inappropriate, and is being made at a time when considerable market power imbalance exists because of the shortage of pipeline capacity leaving the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin,” Canadian Natural President Tim McKay said in the letter.

The regulator should also approve the new terms and conditions and tolls before shippers are required to sign any binding contractual commitments for space, the company’s letter added. In an interview with Reuters on Monday, Enbridge said it is premature to ask the NEB to intervene before the open season ends on Oct. 2.

16.35876114747135," Suncor and Shell urge Canadian regulator to review contentious Enbridge pipeline plan CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Two major oil companies have asked Canada’s energy regulator to urgently review Enbridge Inc’s proposal to switch to fixed contracts on its Mainline pipeline system, arguing the changes would be an abuse of Enbridge’s market power. Suncor Energy Inc, Canada’s second-largest oil producer, and Shell Canada Ltd, a unit of Royal Dutch Shell PLC wrote to the National Energy Board (NEB) on Friday opposing Enbridge’s plans. They join MEG Energy Corp and the Explorers and Producers Association of Canada (EPAC) in growing dissent against Enbridge’s proposal to introduce long-term fixed-volume contracts on North America’s largest pipeline system.

Guy Jarvis, Enbridge’s executive vice president of liquids pipelines, said it was premature to ask the NEB to intervene before Oct. 2, when the open season ends. The company will then submit an application with finalized terms and tolls. “It seems it is getting the cart before the horse because the results of the open season will inform our application,” Jarvis told Reuters. Suncor and Shell asked the NEB, which will ultimately approve or reject Enbridge’s application, to review the terms on offer before Oct. 2. “Suncor continues to believe that the terms and conditions of the open season are not fair, just or reasonable,” the company said in a lawyers’ letter. The NEB is still reviewing the letters to determine its next steps, spokeswoman Sarah Kiley said. Canadian shippers fear U.S. refiners such as BP Plc and ExxonMobil Corp will snap up the bulk of Mainline capacity. They are also concerned the contracts will tie them into delivering crude to the Midwest region, limiting their ability to reach more liquid markets like the U.S. Gulf Coast. Shell said congestion on Canadian export pipelines meant Enbridge was effectively forcing shippers to sign up for unfair tolls on long-term committed capacity or risk being left without market access. “Shell is concerned that the open season and the offering may represent an abuse of market power,” Shell Canada president Michael Crothers said in the letter. Calgary-based investment bank GMP FirstEnergy said the NEB should extend the open season if it needs more to time to make a ruling. “We fear that if the open season is concluded in its current form, this will result in more pricing power being transferred to U.S. Midwest refiners and onerously burdensome long-term commitments on the books for Canadian producers,” GMP FirstEnergy analysts said in a note."

13.227316628967827," MEG Energy joins opposition to Enbridge pipeline changes in Canada CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Oil sands producer MEG Energy Corp has become the largest producer so far to call for pipeline company Enbridge Inc to scrap plans to introduce long-term, fixed-volume contracts on its Mainline system, in a letter to Canadian regulators laying out its opposition. Last month the Explorers and Producers Association of Canada, which represents smaller producers, also wrote to Canada’s National Energy Board opposing the change because of concerns it will favor larger oil producers and refiners. The 2.85 million barrel-per-day Mainline is North America’s largest pipeline system and a crucial conduit for Canadian producers exporting crude to the United States. Enbridge’s plan to switch from a monthly nomination system to “contract carriage” comes at a time when Canadian export pipelines are so constrained the Alberta government has imposed oil production curtailments and has drawn fierce criticism from small producers. “It is MEG’s position that Enbridge’s contract carriage proposal should be abandoned, as it is not in the overall public interest,” said the letter, which was filed on Friday and signed by MEG’s CEO Derek Evans. Evans said Enbridge could delay a two-month open season launched on Aug. 2 to solicit bids for contracted space on 90% of the Mainline. A potential delay was dismissed by Guy Jarvis, Enbridge’s executive vice president of liquids pipelines, who said the company is working to get regulatory approval to switch to fixed contracts before the current Mainline toll system expires in mid-2021. “We are committed to continuing down this path. We think we have got the best offering we can come to given the diversity of our shippers,” Jarvis told Reuters in a phone interview on Monday, adding the 10% of space allocated to spot volumes was standard for fixed-contract pipelines. Under the current monthly nomination system, demand to ship on the Mainline regularly exceeds capacity, forcing Enbridge to ration, or apportion, space. MEG, which produces 90,000 bpd at its Christina Lake project in northern Alberta, is worried the changes will prevent it from meeting previous commitments to ship crude to the Gulf Coast on the Flanagan South pipeline, which the Mainline feeds. Smaller producers are concerned large U.S. refiners like BPPlc will snap up most of the contracted capacity, leaving them scrambling for the smaller slice of the pipeline open for spot volumes. MEG said it understands other parties will write to the NEB outlining concerns with the Enbridge plan and seeking to delay the open season. ARC Energy Research Institute analyst Jackie Forrest said the 10% of the Mainline left open for spot shipping would likely be heavily rationed, resulting in more barrels getting stranded in Alberta each month and being sold off cheaply. “If you shrink spot to 300,000 bpd you are going to see that space be many, many times over-allocated,” Forrest said. “As the level of apportionment increases, the level of (price) discount increases.” It is the second time in just over a year that Enbridge has tried to change the current, highly criticized system. In June2018, it introduced plans to verify shippers’ oil supplies before allocating space but scrapped the policy after BP and others complained."

15.22041211121179," Enbridge seeks partial natgas pipe return Aug. 24-26 after Kentucky blast Aug 16 (Reuters) - Canadian energy company Enbridge Inc said it expects to return one pipe to service between Aug. 24 and 26 on its Texas Eastern natural gas system in Kentucky that shut after an explosion on an adjacent line killed one person on Aug. 1. Texas Eastern has three lines between its Danville and Tompkinsville compressors in Kentucky that make up its 30-inch (76-centimeter) system. They are Lines 10, 15 and 25. The blast occurred on Line 15 near Danville. Enbridge said it plans to replace portions of Lines 10 and 25 in the vicinity of the incident and assess the entire length of Line 15 from Uniontown, Pennsylvania to Kosciusko, Mississippi. The company said it anticipates returning Line 25 to service between Aug. 24 and 26, which would allow about 0.8 bcfd of gas to flow through the area. One billion cubic feet is enough to supply about five million U.S. homes for a day. Enbridge said it expected to complete work on Line 10 by late August or the first week of September. Enbridge warned the schedules were subject to change based on weather conditions and other unforeseen occurrences. Before the company restarts any lines, it must first receive permission to do so from the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA). PHMSA issued a corrective action order on Aug. 8 that requires the company to complete several tasks before the regulator will allow any flows through the blast site. In addition to killing one person, the Kentucky explosion injured at least six other people, destroyed multiple structures and caused a fire that damaged about 30 acres, PHMSA said. PHMSA also said the blast released about 66 million cubic feet of gas, ejected a 30-foot (9.1 meter) section of Line 15 about 460 feet from the failure site and resulted in a 50-foot long, 13-foot deep crater. The agency noted this was not the first blast for this pipe in the area. Line 15, which was constructed beginning in 1942, also failed in November 2003 near Morehead, Kentucky, about 100 miles northeast of Danville.

15.404770585612404," Enbridge needs U.S. approval to restart natgas pipe after Kentucky blast (Reuters) - Canadian energy company Enbridge Inc ENB.TO said it is working to meet the terms of an order from federal regulators so it can restart the part of its Texas Eastern pipeline in Kentucky that was damaged in a blast on Aug. 1 that killed one person. The U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) issued a corrective action order last week requiring the company to perform several tasks before the regulator will allow any flows through the blast site, near Danville, Kentucky. Enbridge said in a release on Friday it was “working diligently to comply with the requirements identified by the PHMSA, and to return to service two adjacent natural gas pipelines near the incident site that were taken out of service as a precautionary safety measure.” Texas Eastern has three lines between its Danville and Tompkinsville compressors in Kentucky that make up its 30-inch (76-centimeter) system. They are Lines 10, 15 and 25. The blast occurred on Line 15, which PHMSA said was constructed beginning in 1942. PHMSA said Enbridge could not restart Lines 10 and 25 without further investigation because the blast might have also damaged the lines. Enbridge did not estimate when it will restart Lines 10 and 25, but there will be no gas flows through the blast site through at least Aug. 16. Before restarting gas flows through the blast site, PHMSA said, Enbridge must uncover and inspect parts of the lines and perform mechanical and metallurgical testing, among other things. In addition to killing one person, the explosion injured at least six other people, destroyed multiple structures and caused a fire that damaged about 30 acres. PHMSA said the blast also released about 66 million cubic feet of gas, ejected a 30-foot (9.1 meter) section of Line 15 that landed about 460 feet from the failure site and resulted in a 50-foot long, 13-foot deep crater. The agency noted this was not the first blast for this pipe in the area. Line 15 also failed in November 2003 near Morehead, Kentucky, about 100 miles northeast of Danville. The Aug. 1 blast was also the second so far this year on the Texas Eastern system following an explosion in Ohio in January that injured at least two people. And it was the third big blast for Enbridge in less than a year following an explosion in British Columbia on its Westcoast system in October."
12.654171006655995," Enbridge works to return Texas Eastern natgas pipe after Kentucky blast (Reuters) - Canadian energy company Enbridge Inc said it is working on a plan to put in service a couple of pipelines adjacent to the Texas Eastern natural gas pipeline in Kentucky that exploded on Aug. 1, killing one person. The company, which made the announcement on Thursday, did not say when the two pipes would return to service. Earlier in the week, the company told customers it expected they would remain shut at least through Aug. 12. Enbridge said it is working with several agencies looking into the blast, including the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board, which is leading the investigation. The blast, near Danville, Kentucky, was the second so far this year on the Texas Eastern system following an explosion in Ohio in January that injured at least two people.

The blast occurred on Line 15. Traders noted the Kentucky incident had only a temporary impact on production in the Appalachia region, which returned to record levels earlier this week. At the time of the blast, about 1.7 billion cubic feet of gas (bcfd) was flowing south from the Marcellus and Utica shale basins in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia through the damaged section of pipe toward the Gulf Coast, according to data from analytics firm Refinitiv. That represents about 2% of the 90 bcfd of all the gas produced in the Lower 48 U.S. states. One billion cubic feet of gas is enough to supply about five million U.S. homes for a day. After the blast, producers in Appalachia briefly reduced output to 31.8 bcfd on Aug. 1 from a record high of 32.6 bcfd earlier in the week, according to Refinitiv data. Appalachia drillers have since boosted production to a new high of 32.7 bcfd on Aug. 5. Enbridge said it restricted north-to-south flows through the Danville compressor to zero. To supply customers in the Southeast, gas is now flowing north on Texas Eastern from the Gulf Coast to Mississippi, Tennessee and Kentucky, according to Refinitiv data. Texas Eastern runs 8,835 miles (14,219 kilometers) from the Gulf Coast to the U.S. Northeast."

11.876015641826694," Canada's Enbridge solicits bids for Mainline oil pipeline amid space crunch (Reuters) - Canadian pipeline company Enbridge Inc ENB.TO said on Friday it would invite bids for contracted space on its Mainline system, as shippers compete to move oil on the country's congested pipeline networks. Currently, shippers nominate barrels on a monthly basis, but Enbridge proposes to switch to a system in which shippers sign long-term fixed volume contracts. The change comes as shippers have complained that the current system is inefficient and as Enbridge seeks to secure volumes ahead of rival projects in the works. The Mainline ships 2.85 million barrels per day of crude from the Canadian province of Alberta to the United States, making it Canada’s biggest oil pipeline network. Pipeline space to move Canada’s crude has not kept with growing output, as courts or regulators have stalled Enbridge’s Line 3 replacement and other projects. “Our new contract offering responds directly to what customers are asking for,” Enbridge Chief Executive Al Monaco said on a quarterly conference call. He said the company took nine months to hear shippers’ concerns and refine terms, resulting in balanced access for all types of customers. Some shippers are, however, concerned that smaller Canadian producers will be elbowed out by refiners like BP Plc BP.L in the U.S. Midwest as they snap up the bulk of space. “Effectively foreign entities will (potentially) own the largest transportation corridor in Canada. That spells disaster for Canadian producers,” one Calgary-based trading source said. Open season began on Friday and runs through Oct. 2. Enbridge said it would sign contracts of eight to 20 years with shippers on 90% of the network, leaving the remainder for spot sales. The contracts take effect in mid-2021, pending regulatory approval. The company lowered its volume requirements last month to satisfy smaller producers, Reuters reported. Enbridge shares rose 1.2% in Toronto. Separately, the company reported adjusted earnings that rose to C$1.35 billion ($1.02 billion), or 67 Canadian cents per share, in the second quarter, from C$1.09 billion, or 65 Canadian cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting 59 Canadian cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The company transported 2.66 million barrels per day through the Mainline, up from 2.64 million barrels per day a year earlier. It also said its natural gas line in Moreland, Kentucky, that exploded, killing one person and igniting homes, will not return to service until it is “absolutely safe.”"

11.410431660336284," Kentucky gas line erupts in ball of flames, killing one and igniting homes (Reuters) - A natural gas line erupted in a ball of flames that could be seen for miles over a residential community in rural Kentucky on Thursday, killing one person and setting several houses on fire, a local sheriff said. The blast, in Moreland, a community about 40 miles (65 km) south of Lexington, was the second so far this year on Canadian energy company Enbridge Inc’s Texas Eastern natural gas pipeline following an incident in Ohio in January that injured at least two people. A woman killed in Thursday’s explosion was found outside her home, Lincoln County Sheriff Curt Folger said. Local media said at least five others were injured in the blast. “We’re trying to get a head count,” Folger said, adding that about five homes had caught fire and that firefighters were working to extinguish those blazes. Flames from the explosion rose about 300 feet (100 meters) in the air, Lexington television station WKYT reported, citing emergency managers. The WKYT meteorologist said the fire showed up on radar. “It woke us up and it was just a big roar and it was fire going up into the sky as far as you could see,” area resident Sue Routin told Lexington television station Lex 18. The pipeline was 30 inches (76 cm) in diameter, Folger said, and was shut off after the blast. The Texas Eastern pipeline connects Texas and the U.S. Gulf Coast with states in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions, according to the company’s website. In January, the pipe experienced an explosion in Ohio that caused producers in Appalachia to reduce output by about 1 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) for about a week. One billion cubic feet is enough to supply about five million U.S. homes. Separately, Enbridge suffered another blast on a pipeline, known as the Westcoast system, in British Columbia in October. The Kentucky blast cut the amount of gas flowing on the pipe south of Enbridge’s Danville compressor station in Kentucky to zero. Prior to the explosion about 1.7 bcfd of gas was moving south through the area in Kentucky from the Marcellus and Utica shale in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia toward the Gulf Coast, according to pipeline flow data from Refinitiv. That represents about 2% of the 90 bcfd of gas currently being produced in the Lower 48 U.S. states. The gas was supplying utilities along the pipe route and other consumers, including industrial facilities and liquefied natural gas (LNG) export terminals on the Gulf Coast. Energy traders said the pipe shutdown would be disruptive to affected customers and would likely boost gas costs, at least temporarily, but noted those consumers should have no problem switching to other fuel suppliers in the Gulf Coast or Northeast until Enbridge restores service. Producers in the Appalachia region, meanwhile, were expected to reduce output by about 1 bcfd to around 31.0 bcfd on Thursday from 32.2 bcfd on Wednesday, according to preliminary pipeline flow data from Refinitiv. Traders, however, noted the preliminary data is often revised as more information becomes available. Enbridge told customers using the pipe that it could not immediately estimate when the pipe would return to service. “Our first concern is for those impacted by this incident and ensuring the safety of the community,” Enbridge said in a statement, noting it had isolated the affected line and was working with emergency responders to manage the situation. Enbridge said the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board had assumed control of the incident site and the company was supporting its investigation. The NTSB investigates aviation, highway, marine, rail and pipeline accidents and makes recommendations to improve transportation safety."
10.494729336063912," Enbridge says open to Line 5 re-route after legal action by Wisconsin tribe (Reuters) - Canadian pipeline company Enbridge Inc said on Thursday it will consider re-routing its Line 5 oil pipeline after a Native American tribe in Wisconsin sued the company in a bid to get the pipeline moved off its reservation. The Bad River Band filed a federal lawsuit against Enbridge on Tuesday in the Western District of Wisconsin, asking for a section of Line 5 that runs across its reservation to be decommissioned and removed because of the risk of a leak. The 540,000 barrels-per-day pipeline ferries crude and propane from Alberta to refineries in the Midwest and Ontario. It is a critical part of Enbridge’s Mainline network, which delivers the bulk of Canadian oil exports to the United States. In the lawsuit the Bad River Band said pipeline easements, which are land use agreements between Enbridge and the tribe, for Line 5 had expired and as such the pipeline was trespassing. Enbridge said the vast majority of easements are valid until 2043 and those in question affect only a “small fraction” of the 12 miles of Line 5 within the reservation. “Enbridge has considered re-routing Line 5, and as discussed with the Bad River Band, remains open to this option as a solution,” Enbridge said in a statement. Line 5 also faces a court battle in Michigan, where the state filed a lawsuit last month asking for the decommissioning of an underwater section of the pipeline that runs beneath the Straits of Mackinac in the Great Lakes. One of Canada’s largest oil and gas producer Suncor Energy, which owns an 85,000 barrel per day refinery in Sarnia, Ontario, said it thought the probability of Line 5 getting shut in is “very low” but was nevertheless focused on the risk. “We are spending time looking through and trying to understand how we would manage that and we think there are ways we could mitigate the risk associated with it,” Suncor Chief Executive Officer Mark Little told investors on a second-quarter earnings call on Thursday."
6.298488755166812," Wisconsin tribe sues Canada's Enbridge to shut down crude oil pipeline (Reuters) - A Native American tribe in Wisconsin is suing Enbridge Inc in a bid to shut down an aging oil pipeline that runs across its tribal land, the latest in a string of challenges against the Canadian company’s pipelines in the U.S. Midwest. The Bad River Band filed a federal lawsuit against Enbridge on Tuesday in the Western District of Wisconsin, asking for the section of Line 5 that runs across its reservation to be decommissioned and removed because of the risk of a leak. The 66-year-old pipeline carries 540,000 barrels per day of light crude and propane from Alberta to refineries in the Midwest and Ontario and is a critical part of Enbridge’s Mainline network, which delivers the bulk of Canadian oil exports to the United States. The band is most concerned about a section of Line 5 near the Bad River, where bank erosion could soon leave the pipeline exposed to the full force of the river, the lawsuit says, describing the situation as a “looming disaster.” “We want the constant threat of that pipe eliminated. We want it out of our aquifer and the greater Bad River watershed,” Mike Wiggins Jr., acting tribal chairman of the Bad River Band, told Reuters on Wednesday. Pipeline easements, which are agreements allowing Enbridge to use Bad River land, expired in 2013. The lawsuit argues the continued use of Line 5 constitutes trespassing and seeks an injunction that would force Enbridge to cease operations and remove the pipeline. The Bad River Band and Enbridge have been in negotiations regarding the easements since 2013 but Wiggins Jr. said there were “irreconcilable differences” between the two parties. Enbridge spokesman Michael Barnes said the company needed time to review the contents of the legal filing. Most of Line 5’s right of way through the Bad River reservation is not affected by the dispute, he added, because it is covered by different easements. Enbridge faces a difficult situation because tribes have authority over their own lands and cannot be forced to allow pipelines to operate, said James Freeman, a partner with law firm Zabel Freeman in Houston. “It’s not a good thing one way or another if Enbridge cannot work out an agreement with this tribe,” Freeman said. Line 5 is also facing a court battle in Michigan, where the state filed a lawsuit last month asking for an underwater section of the pipeline that runs beneath the Straits of Mackinac in the Great Lakes to be decommissioned. In addition, Enbridge faces delays on its Line 3 replacement project, which would double capacity on a different pipeline carrying oil from Alberta to the Midwest, after a Minnesota court ruled that Enbridge’s final environmental impact statement was inadequate."

The Bad River Band filed a federal lawsuit against Enbridge on Tuesday in the Western District of Wisconsin calling for the 12-mile section of Line 5 that runs across its reservation to be declared “public nuisance and a trespass.” The lawsuit says there is a risk the 66-year-old pipeline could rupture and spill oil, and asks for an injunction requiring Enbridge to stop operating Line 5 on the reservation and to safely remove it. Line 5 carries 540,000 barrels per day of crude from Alberta to refineries in the U.S. Midwest and Ontario and is a crucial part of Enbridge’s Mainline pipeline network, which delivers the bulk of Canadian oil exports to the United States.

He added that Enbridge has been in negotiations with the Bad River Band regarding easements, as land use rights are known, since 2013. “The vast majority of Enbridge’s right of way through the Bad River Reservation is covered by either perpetual easements on private land or a 50-year agreement between Enbridge and the Band, which does not expire until 2043,” Barnes said."
0.6087393028878584," UPDATE 1-Enbridge delays open season for bids on Mainline oil pipeline system -sources (Adds detail on connections, updates sourcing on new timeline) NEW YORK/CALGARY, Alberta, July 17 (Reuters) - Enbridge Inc has delayed the start of an open season to solicit bids for contracted space on its Mainline oil pipeline system, North America’s largest oil-shipping network, three market sources told Reuters on Wednesday. The reason for the delay was not immediately clear. Canadian pipeline company Enbridge plans to turn the Mainline system from a common carrier system in which shippers submit monthly bids for capacity, to one that is mostly contracted for up to two decades. The open season, a period in which shippers can submit bids for contracted space, was meant to start in mid-July and last for two months, Enbridge said previously. Three sources said the start of the open season was scheduled for Monday, July 15, but had been pushed back. Two of the sources said the delay was expected to last about a week. “We have been in discussions with interested shippers and are working to accommodate to their needs. We anticipate on holding the open season soon,” Enbridge spokeswoman Tracie Kenyon said in an emailed statement when asked about the delay. The Mainline system is vital to transport barrels out of Canada, the world’s fourth-largest oil producer, which has grappled with delays in pipeline projects because of environmental and legal opposition. Locking shippers into long-term contracts offers Enbridge a chance to capitalize on delays to competitors’ plans to build pipelines, and secure future cash flow at a time when anxiety about market access is dominating headlines. The Mainline currently operates under a system in which customers nominate the barrels they want to move each month, generating criticism that some larger shippers inflate their nominations to game the system. Space on the Mainline is often rationed, contributing to price volatility in marketing hubs in Alberta, Canada’s main crude-producing province. Changes to the Mainline system will need to be approved by Canada’s National Energy Board regulator and would take effect in 2021. Currently, the open season pertains solely to the Canadian Mainline, Kenyon said, adding that Enbridge will evaluate interconnecting pipelines after the Canadian Mainline open season. Enbridge also operates major U.S. oil pipelines including Spearhead and Flanagan South. Smaller Canadian producers have raised concerns they will not be able to meet Enbridge’s minimum-term and volume commitments and be shut out of the Mainline by larger competitors and U.S. refiners snapping up all the available capacity. Last week, Enbridge confirmed it had lowered the minimum oil volumes required to 2,200 barrels per day from 6,000 barrels per day.

-1.3646258313389938," Exclusive: Enbridge eases oil volume terms for Mainline pipeline in response to small producers' fears CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Enbridge Inc ENB.TO has lowered oil-shipping requirements on its Mainline pipeline by nearly two-thirds, the company confirmed on Wednesday, a move likely to satisfy smaller producers that feared they would be elbowed out by the company's initial requirements. Enbridge now requires minimum volume commitments of 2,200 barrels per day (bpd), down from the 6,000 bpd commitment it previously sought, Enbridge spokesman Jesse Semko told Reuters. The company confirmed the change after sources said Enbridge had made the adjustment. Enbridge plans to turn the Mainline, North America’s largest oil-shipping network, from a common carrier system that is open to all shippers, to one that is mostly contracted for up to two decades. The initial terms raised concerns among smaller shippers about meeting Enbridge’s time and volume minimums. But since spring, Enbridge has broadly consulted the industry and eased the stringent requirements, sources added. They spoke on condition of anonymity because Enbridge required non-disclosure agreements about its plans. The commitments are for between eight and about 20 years, unchanged from the earlier terms. The company plans to start open season, a period of soliciting bids for its Mainline space, in July. The change, subject to approval by the National Energy Board regulator, would take effect in 2021. Locking shippers into long-term contracts offers Enbridge a chance to capitalize on delays to competitors’ plans to build pipelines, and secure future cash flow at a time when anxiety about market access is dominating headlines. The Mainline currently operates under a system in which shippers nominate the barrels they want to move each month, generating criticism that some larger producers inflate their nominations to game the system. The Alberta government took the rare step in January of ordering oil production cuts to boost prices. Canada has the world’s third-largest oil reserves, but a shortage of pipeline capacity has crimped Canadian prices and caused investors to shun the sector. On Wednesday, one medium-sized oil producer, Baytex Energy Corp BTE.TO, said it was ""very concerned"" about Enbridge's plans to contract Mainline capacity. “We do not like the current (nomination) system. ... Whatever ends up around Enbridge contracting that space needs to be fair to conventional producers,” Baytex’s chief executive, Ed LaFehr, said at a TD Securities investor conference in Calgary."
3.1089791501771895," Michigan sues Enbridge in U.S., seeks to shut oil pipeline through Great Lakes CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - The U.S. state of Michigan has filed a lawsuit asking for an Enbridge Inc oil pipeline that runs under the Straits of Mackinac in the Great Lakes to be decommissioned, Michigan’s attorney general said on Thursday. The Line 5 oil pipeline ships 540,000 barrels per day of light crude oil and propane and is a critical part of Enbridge’s Mainline network, which delivers the bulk of Canadian crude exports to the United States. Potential disruption to Line 5 adds to the Canadian oil sector’s worries about transporting crude, with fierce opposition and long delays plaguing proposed expansions of other pipelines by Enbridge, TC Energy Corp and the Canadian government. The underwater portion of Line 5 has long been a bone of contention between Enbridge and the state of Michigan, which says a leak from the twin 66-year-old pipelines would cause catastrophic environmental damage to the Great Lakes. In the lawsuit filed in the Ingham County Circuit Court, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel asked the court to find that Enbridge’s continued operation of the Straits pipelines under an easement granted in 1953 violates the public trust doctrine. The lawsuit said the pipeline is a common law public nuisance and violates the Michigan Environmental Protection Act because it is likely to pollute water and hurt other natural resources. It identified an anchor strike as the most significant risk to Line 5, which runs through the straits where Lakes Huron and Michigan meet. “The location of the pipelines...combines great ecological sensitivity with exceptional vulnerability to anchor strikes,” said Nessel in a statement. “This situation with Line 5 differs from other bodies of water where pipelines exist because the currents in the Straits of Mackinac are complex, variable, and remarkably fast and strong.” The lawsuit seeks a court order to shut down and decommission the Straits pipelines as soon as possible after a reasonable notice period. Nessel also filed a motion to dismiss an Enbridge lawsuit from earlier this month, that sought to enforce an agreement made with the previous governor of Michigan. That agreement would have allowed Enbridge to build a tunnel to house the underwater pipelines and continue to operate Line 5. Calgary, Alberta-based Enbridge said it was disappointed that Michigan had not accepted its offer to advance talks on the Straits tunnel, and would need time to fully evaluate the attorney general’s filing. “We believe the Straits tunnel is the best way to protect the community and the Great Lakes while safely meeting Michigan’s energy needs,” Enbridge spokesman Ryan Duffy said in a statement. In its long period of service, there have been no known oil spills from the Straits portion of Line 5, but there was a near miss in 2018 when an anchor struck the pipeline, damaging but not rupturing it. “We really dodged a bullet there,” said Liz Kirkwood, executive director of FLOW For Love of Water, a group that aims to protect the Great Lakes, adding that powerful currents and heavy ship traffic create high risk. “It’s the worst of all possible places for an oil spill in the Great Lakes.” It is unclear if Line 5 could operate without the Straits segment. But the potential for disruption is likely to cap Enbridge’s share price in the near term, said RBC analyst Robert Kwan, in a note. The company’s stock was up 0.9%. The pipeline delivers crude to refineries including Marathon Petroleum Corp’s Detroit refinery and Suncor Energy’s Sarnia, Ontario facility."

The lawsuit says Enbridge’s continued operation of the underwater portion of Line 5 under an easement granted in 1953 violates the public trust doctrine, is a common law public nuisance, and violates the Michigan Environmental Protection Act because it is likely to cause pollution impairment and destruction of water and other natural resources.

Canada has faced years of delay in getting new oil pipelines built because of environmental opposition, resulting in severe congestion in Alberta, the country’s main crude-producing province, that forced the provincial government to impose production cuts this year. Pipelines face increasing scrutiny from environmental groups worried about leaks, and U.S. Great Lakes states are taking a hard look at the risks. The Minnesota Court of Appeals ruled on June 3 that the environmental impact statement for Enbridge’s Line 3 failed to properly address the spill risk in Lake Superior, imposing a fresh challenge to the company’s construction schedule. Also last week, Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer repeated a threat to shut down Line 5 unless Enbridge accelerated its timeline to replace it. “That is a real-time problem because (Line 3) was the most imminent chance for Canadian production to see some pressure release on the system,” said Rafi Tahmazian, senior portfolio manager at Canoe Financial, which owns shares of Canadian Natural Resources and other oil producers. “It’s disappointing and concerning.” Enbridge shares dropped 5 percent in Toronto last week, hovering near a three-month low. Line 3 carries oil from Alberta to U.S. refineries in Minnesota and Wisconsin. Line 5 takes oil from Wisconsin to refineries in Sarnia, Ontario, passing through the Straits of Mackinac channel connecting Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. Both were built in the 1960s. In a statement on Friday, Enbridge said it was still analyzing the court’s decision on Line 3. Without a valid environment statement, Enbridge’s certificate of need and route permit, which it received from the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (PUC) a year ago over boisterous opposition, are void. Minnesota’s Department of Commerce and Enbridge must now re-draft the statement to the PUC’s satisfaction, a process likely to take at least six months, said Alexandra Klass, a University of Minnesota law professor. Enbridge has previously said it expects to have the remaining Minnesota permits for Line 3 by November and will put it into service in the second half of 2020. It has not said how the appeal court’s ruling may now affect that plan. “As of now they do not have any valid state permits,” Klass said. “I don’t know their construction schedule, but it does seem ambitious.” PUC officials declined to comment. With no valid environment statement, Minnesota’s natural resources department and pollution control agency cannot issue the required state permits either, said Scott Strand, lawyer for the Friends of the Headwaters environmental group. “It doesn’t seem likely that the calendar can just stay in place,” he said. The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency must issue Line 3’s water quality certification by Oct. 30 or Enbridge would need to re-apply, re-starting a year-long process, said spokesman Darin Broton. Minnesota’s Department of Natural Resources said in a statement that it was determining its next steps. In Michigan, Enbridge said it is taking legal action regarding Line 5 to enforce agreements with a previous Michigan administration that allowed it to build a tunnel under the Straits to replace an underwater section of pipe. The governor has said she fears anchors from boats could rupture the existing pipe. Whitmer’s insistence on shutting down Line 5 in two years, ahead of the 2024 completion date for the tunnel, led to Enbridge’s legal action, the company said. Whitmer wrote to Enbridge CEO Al Monaco on Monday saying that she wants a firm date to shut down the underwater portion of the pipeline, and that the state could otherwise shut down Line 5.

-3.427871213847819," U.S. court rejects environmental assessment for Enbridge pipeline in blow to Canadian oil sector CALGARY, Alberta/ WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - A Minnesota court ruled on Monday that Enbridge Inc’s environmental impact statement for the replacement of its Line 3 oil pipeline is inadequate, raising the possibility of further delays. The Line 3 project would double current capacity to 760,000 barrels per day of Canadian crude from Alberta to Wisconsin, providing much-needed relief from congestion on existing Canadian pipelines. It is the furthest advanced of three proposed pipeline projects - along with the Canadian government-owned Trans Mountain and TC Energy Corp’s Keystone XL - that would ease Alberta’s oil glut. All three have faced long delays. In a decision posted online, the Minnesota Court of Appeals ruled that the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission, a state regulator that approved the Line 3 project last year, acted in a manner that was unsupported by “substantial evidence” when it determined the impact statement was adequate. The impact statement specifically failed to address how an oil spill from the line would affect Lake Superior and its watershed, the court said. Enbridge is analyzing the court’s decision and consulting the commission and other state agencies about next steps, the Calgary-based company said in a statement. It is disappointed in the ruling, since the impact statement was based on the most extensive environment study of a pipeline in Minnesota’s history, Enbridge added. “I think they’re going to have to take (a potential spill) much more seriously than just some hypothetical modeling and really be conscious about the headwaters of the Great Lakes,” said Frank Bibeau, lawyer for the Honor the Earth environmental group. Enbridge shares fell 4.7% to close at C$47.42, a three-month low, on the Toronto Stock Exchange on Monday. “We believe that the market will negatively view the court decision that casts uncertainty with respect to the timeline for the Line 3 Replacement (L3R) project and specifically the ability to bring L3R into service in H2/20,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Robert Kwan said in a note. In March, Enbridge said Line 3 would be delayed until the second half of 2020 because of permitting delays in Minnesota, and the prospect of further holdups is another blow to the beleaguered Canadian energy industry. “We are concerned to see any further delays that this new development may cause to Enbridge’s Line 3 Replacement Project,” said Beth Lau, manager of oil supply and transportation at the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers. “Increased transportation capacity in all directions is needed to reach new and growing markets to ensure Canada remains globally competitive.” The Alberta government imposed mandatory production curtailments on producers effective Jan. 1 this year because of congestion on export pipelines. RBC’s Kwan said at this stage it was not clear whether the environmental impact statement could be amended or if a new one would be required. The Canadian government will decide by June 18 whether to proceed with expanding its Trans Mountain pipeline, which would increase the flow of oil from Alberta to the British Columbia coast."

-8.249652681477837," Enbridge warns Line three pipeline cost could exceed C$9 billion CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Enbridge Inc, Canada’s largest pipeline operator, said on Friday there is a risk its Line 3 replacement project could exceed its previous cost estimate of C$9 billion ($6.71 billion) because of delays to permits in the United States. Once complete, Line 3 will carry 760,000 barrels per day of western Canadian crude to U.S. markets. In March Enbridge said the in-service date would be delayed by almost a year until the second half of 2020 because of slower-than-expected permitting in the U.S. state of Minnesota. Enbridge told analysts on a quarterly earnings call as long as permits are in hand by year-end the project will start running in the latter part of next year. “The late schedule likely means higher costs on the U.S. side although we are running under budget in Canada,” Enbridge chief executive Al Monaco said, adding that returns remained “very robust” and the company did not expect any cost overruns to be material to its financial outlook. Canada is the world’s fourth-largest crude producer but companies in landlocked Alberta are desperate for new export pipelines to help alleviate congestion and increase access to higher-priced markets. Enbridge is also in talks with shippers about introducing long-term, set volume contracts on its 2.85 million bpd Mainline system, moving away from the current monthly allocation system. The company addressed concerns from smaller oil producers that they may struggle to meet the minimum terms being proposed. “We are going to great lengths in terms of the way our offering is being developed to accommodate many of the issues and concerns and opportunities that our shippers are putting in front of us,” said Guy Jarvis, Enbridge president of liquids pipelines, adding that small producers can contract for as little as 6,000 bpd. Enbridge plans to launch an open season in mid-July. The Calgary-based company beat analysts’ estimates for quarterly profit as it benefited from transporting more oil and gas across its pipelines. Enbridge shipped 2.7 million bpd on the Mainline system during the first quarter, up from 2.6 million bpd in the year-ago quarter. Adjusted earnings rose to C$1.64 billion in the first quarter, from C$1.38 billion in same quarter of 2018. On an adjusted per share basis, the company earned 81 Canadian cents, while analysts’ on average had expected 72 Canadian cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

-7.4965885457947214," Canadian Natural worried about changes to Enbridge pipeline system CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Canadian Natural Resources Ltd said on Thursday it is against proposed changes to shipping agreements on Enbridge Inc’s Mainline pipeline system because it does not want to be “held hostage” to one delivery point for its crude. The Enbridge Mainline system delivers 2.85 million barrels of crude per day from western Canada to the U.S. Midwest, an area known as Padd 2, where it connects to other pipelines stretching across North America. Enbridge is proposing to shift away from a monthly allocation system to long-term, set-volume contracts. Reuters exclusively reported this week the pipeline company is seeking a minimum eight-year term, raising concerns among small producers that they will lose out to bigger players. Canadian Natural, Canada’s largest oil and gas producer by volume, told analysts on a quarterly earnings call it is worried about being locked into delivery in Padd 2. “Preliminary ... we are not in favor of it,” Steve Laut, Canadian Natural’s executive vice chairman, said. “The issue we see is that by not having multiple exit points along the line we would be held hostage into that one area. “We would love to have a pipeline with good access to the Gulf Coast where you have a competitive market and could sell your barrels a market price versus a discount.” Canada is the world’s fourth-largest crude producer but its heavy oil trades at a discount to U.S. barrels because of congestion on export pipelines that can leave crude bottlenecked in storage tanks in Alberta. Record discounts last year prompted the Alberta government to impose temporary production curtailments to help relieve the glut, a move Canadian Natural supports, saying it had helped normalize markets and save thousands of jobs. The Calgary-based company reported a better-than-expected first-quarter profit, boosted by higher prices for its crude because of the curtailments. Canadian Natural said production fell 8 percent to 1.04 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) and it realized C$53.98 per barrel of crude oil and natural gas liquids in the reported period. In the year-earlier quarter, average realized prices were C$43.06 per barrel. Net earnings rose to C$961 million ($712.86 million), or 80 Canadian cents per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, from C$583 million, or 48 Canadian cents, a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, the company earned 70 Canadian cents per share, beating analysts’ estimates of 51 Canadian cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

-7.595966129724481," Exclusive: Enbridge seeking at least eight-year oil shipping commitments on Canada Mainline, worrying small producers WINNIPEG, Manitoba/CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Canada’s Enbridge is asking oil shippers to sign at least eight-year contracts to move crude on its Mainline pipeline network, as it proposes to shift away from a monthly allocation system, people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. The minimum term Enbridge Inc is seeking, previously unreported, is raising fears among small Canadian producers that they will lose out to bigger players, at a time when pipeline congestion has damaged the energy sector’s outlook. Three sources with knowledge of the confidential talks confirmed the minimum term. Enbridge has previously disclosed that the maximum term is 20 years under a plan that still requires approval from Canada’s National Energy Board. The company declined, in an email, to confirm the minimum term it is seeking, saying it is commercially sensitive information. Locking shippers into long-term contracts offers Enbridge a chance to capitalize on delays to competitors’ plans to build pipelines, and secure future cash flow at a time when anxiety about market access is dominating headlines. The Alberta government took the rare step in January of ordering oil production cuts to boost prices. Canada is the world’s fourth-largest crude producer but a shortage of pipeline capacity has contributed to an exodus of $20 billion in foreign capital from Alberta’s oil sands since 2017. Under the proposed Mainline changes, producers fear being out-bid by oil sands majors such as Canadian Natural Resources Ltd and Suncor Energy Inc. “If there is lack of pipe capacity, obviously the pipelines are in control and can dictate terms,” said Chief Executive Rob Morgan of Cona Resources Ltd, which produces up to 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in Saskatchewan. The length of commitments is the biggest concern for small producers, Morgan said. Enbridge spokesman Jesse Semko said Enbridge hopes to meet the needs of all industry participants, but added that small producers account for an “extremely small” percentage of Mainline volume. Semko said Enbridge has been engaging with the industry about the Mainline for more than a year, offering flexibility on both terms and volume. He said Enbridge anticipates holding a 60-day bidding period, known as an open season, starting in July. Enbridge’s Mainline, a web of pipelines connecting western Canada’s production basins with U.S. Midwest and eastern Canadian refineries, handles 2.85 million barrels of oil per day. It will add another 380,000 bpd once the Line 3 replacement project is complete. The Mainline, whose first leg was built in 1950, is a common carrier pipeline, similar to a railway, on which all shippers theoretically have access to moving goods. Shippers currently nominate how many barrels they wish to move monthly. Since demand always exceeds capacity, Enbridge rations space. Some say large shippers game the system by over-estimating their needs, nominating so-called “air barrels”, so they are not left short when volumes are apportioned. Canadian Natural Resources called the system “dysfunctional” in March, adding it contributed to congestion that ultimately prompted Alberta’s curtailments. Enbridge president of liquids pipelines Guy Jarvis said in December the company would improve the Mainline by switching in 2021 to a toll system, known as “take-or-pay”, common to other pipelines. It would sell up to 90 percent of Mainline space to shippers in exchange for long-term, set volume commitments. Shippers must then pay for the space whether they use it or not. Such commitments are a problem for small producers because lenders view them as liabilities, said Tristan Goodman, president of the Explorers and Producers Association of Canada. “It’s like taking out a lease on your building - you have to pay it, no matter what,” he said. Small to midsize players are discussing how they might pool oil to meet Enbridge’s volume minimum, Cona’s Morgan said. Producers of 50,000 boepd or less account for 19 percent of western Canadian crude production, according to a Canadian Energy Research Institute calculation using CanOils data. “(The Mainline) is magnitudes larger than some of the other pipelines and it’s the backbone of Canadian shipments,” said Saskatchewan Energy Minister Bronwyn Eyre. “That for Saskatchewan producers, smaller producers, is a real concern. It’s the unknown of what (take-or-pay) might mean.” The Mainline’s switch “could definitely widen the divide,” between big and small, said Ryan Bushell, president of Newhaven Asset Management, which holds Enbridge shares. Smaller producers could find it hard to meet Enbridge’s terms, although they would benefit indirectly if the change results in less price volatility, he said. For Enbridge, the change could be a savvy move to tie up volumes while uncertainties persist about the future of TC Energy’s Keystone XL and the Canadian government-owned Trans Mountain expansion project. “(Enbridge) wants to guarantee their cash flow and wants to strike now while everyone is freaking out about pipeline space,” said one industry source. Take-or-pay models are more commonly used on new pipelines and the fact Enbridge is applying it to the decades-old Mainline shows how valued pipelines have become in Canada, Bushell said. While big shippers are likely to welcome a more efficient system with contracted volumes, they must decide if they are willing to commit to the Mainline when there is still a chance Keystone XL and the Trans Mountain expansion will get built, said Wood Mackenzie analyst John Coleman. “Shippers have got kind of a tricky situation,” Coleman said. “It’s going to be a harder-than-normal open season (for Enbridge) because of immense uncertainty around other pipeline projects looking to get built.”"

The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission initially approved Enbridge’s plan to rebuild the aging 1,031-mile (1,660-km) pipeline that runs from Alberta to the U.S. state of Wisconsin in June, but that decision was challenged by Minnesota’s governor in February.[nL1N1TU1D9} On Tuesday, the PUC denied all petitions asking for its decision to be reconsidered, according to minutes of the meeting. Minnesota PUC spokesman Dan Wolf said a formal order will be issued soon. “The PUC confirmed its decision to approve the conditions placed on L3R’s (Line 3 Replacement) Certificate of Need – conditions meant to protect Minnesotans – allowing this critical energy infrastructure modernization project to move forward,” Enbridge said in a statement. The decision clears a hurdle for the pipeline and is welcome news for Canadian oil producers struggling with congestion on export pipelines as crude production increases. The discount last year on Canadian heavy crude versus U.S. barrels widened to record levels, prompting the Alberta government to impose production curtailments to draw down crude storage inventories and help shore up prices. In a blow to Alberta’s oil and gas sector, Line 3 hit a snag earlier this month when Enbridge said its replacement will be delayed by almost a year until the second half of 2020 while the project awaits state and federal permits. “It (the PUC decision) is good news for Enbridge undoubtedly, but they still have the issue of local permits that are delayed,” Wood Mackenzie analyst Mark Oberstoetter said. In its statement, Enbridge said it is hopeful the remaining permitting schedule stays on track. Line 3, which began service in 1968, currently operates at half its capacity. Its replacement would allow it to return to approved capacity of 760,000 barrels per day. Enbridge shares were down 0.1 percent at C$48.96 on Wednesday afternoon on the Toronto Stock Exchange."

-4.547958419352555," Kinder Morgan quits Enbridge, Oiltanking crude export venture HOUSTON (Reuters) - Kinder Morgan Inc has dropped out of a recently proposed U.S. Gulf Coast deepwater crude export venture, the project’s leader Enbridge Inc said on Monday. The $800 million project, known as Texas COLT, is one of eight similar projects proposing facilities that would move U.S. shale to overseas markets by loading supertankers able to carry up to 2 million barrels apiece. Pipeline operators Enbridge and Kinder Morgan disclosed plans to build an crude export terminal off Freeport, Texas, in January, and filed permit applications with the U.S. Maritime Administration. German oil storage firm Oiltanking Partners remains committed to the project, said Enbridge. “The project does not align with our strategic priorities,” Kinder Morgan spokeswoman Lexey Long said. The company cited the time commitment to move the project through a regulatory phase and a recent internal review. Enbridge said it will buy out Kinder Morgan’s stake in the project, and expects the facility would still be well-positioned to “provide the supply diversity” that is attractive to overseas U.S. crude buyers, spokesman Michael Barnes said. “Enbridge has interests in Gray Oak, Seaway and ETCO pipelines serving Houston crude markets,” Barnes said. Kinder Morgan’s involvement in the joint venture provided access to the 300,000 barrel-per-day Kinder Morgan Crude and Condensate pipeline that runs from the Eagle Ford shale in South Texas to the Gulf Coast. The proposed COLT project would load 23 supertankers per month at a rate of 85,000 barrels per hour. The vessels would be moored at an offshore platform almost 30 miles (48 km) off Texas, in 110 feet (33.5 m) of water, with oil supplied through a 42-inch (107 cm) pipeline, Enbridge said in regulatory documents."
1.9109879350047414," Enbridge shares fall on Canadian oil pipeline delay CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Shares in pipeline operator Enbridge Inc fell 6 percent on Monday after the company said its Line 3 oil pipeline would be delayed until the second half of 2020, dealing yet another blow to the struggling Canadian energy industry. Line 3 will carry Canadian crude to U.S. markets and the delay is the latest setback for producers who in recent months have been grappling with bottlenecks on congested export pipelines and record discounts on heavy barrels as a result. The U.S. state of Minnesota, which Line 3 crosses, told Enbridge it will issue all state environmental permits by November. The company previously expected those permits by the second quarter of 2019. Once it receives state permits, Enbridge will finalize federal permits 30 to 60 days later and anticipates the pipeline to start running in the second half of 2020. Last month Enbridge told investors it expected Line 3 to be in service by year end. “The delay to the Line 3 Replacement is yet another blow to a beleaguered Canadian oil industry that simply cannot catch a break,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Tran. Other proposed Canadian export pipelines, including the Trans Mountain Expansion, are also mired in regulatory delays and concerns about market access are contributing to slowing investment in the energy sector. Oil and gas capital spending in Alberta is expected to fall 3 percent to C$25.9 billion ($19.45 billion) this year, according to ATB Financial, less than half of capital expenditure in 2014. Enbridge shares were last down 5.9 percent at C$46.59 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Enbridge spokeswoman Tracie Kenyon said the company was pleased to have a firm schedule on the remaining Minnesota permits. Once completed the $9 billion pipeline project will ship 760,000 barrels per day from Alberta to Wisconsin, doubling current capacity. Canadian producers have been counting on Line 3 to help ease crude gluts in Alberta that prompted the provincial government to impose temporary production cuts and announce plans to lease 4,400 rail cars to help transport crude to market. “This kind of uncertainty is exactly why we have a plan to move more oil by rail until new pipelines are built,” said Mike McKinnon, spokesman for the Alberta Minister of Energy. The delay means the Alberta government could consider extending production cuts, analysts at Tudor Pickering Holt said in a note.

2.3729635897864316," Enbridge 'not surprised' by Minnesota governor's pipeline appeal: CEO (Reuters) - Canadian pipeline operator Enbridge Inc was not surprised by renewed opposition from Minnesota’s state government to its C$9 billion Line 3 but still expects the oil pipeline replacement to enter service by year-end, its chief executive said on Friday. The pipeline passes through Minnesota as it runs from Alberta to Wisconsin. Line 3, opened in 1968, runs at half its capacity because of its age and corrosion. Replacement would allow Enbridge to restore its flow to 760,000 barrels per day. Canadian oil producers say the project is critical to expanding their congested transport options, but some groups in Minnesota say it would harm the environment and indigenous areas. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said this week that the state’s commerce department will ask Minnesota’s Public Utilities Commission to reconsider its Line 3 approval. “It’s common for regulatory decisions to be challenged,” Enbridge Chief Executive Al Monaco said on a quarterly conference call. “Although we certainly don’t agree with (the commerce department’s) views, we’re not surprised by the filing.” Minnesota’s commerce department had argued to the commission in June that Enbridge had failed to prove the pipeline is necessary. Pending the state’s appeal and Enbridge’s applications for federal, state and municipal permits, its construction schedule in Minnesota is flexible to bring the 1,031-mile (1,660-km) pipeline into service as planned, Monaco said. Construction crews need to be working by June to meet the schedule, said Guy Jarvis, president of Enbridge’s liquids pipelines business. Enbridge shares rose 0.5 percent in Toronto to C$47.57. Enbridge topped analysts’ estimates for quarterly profit on Friday, as it moved more crude oil and refined products along its pipelines. The Calgary, Alberta-based company said it transported 2.7 million bpd of crude oil on its Mainline system across Canada and the United States during the quarter, up from 2.6 million bpd in the year-ago quarter. Net income rose to C$1.09 billion ($820.35 million), or 60 Canadian cents per share, in the fourth quarter, from C$207 million, or 13 Canadian cents per share. On an adjusted basis, the company earned 65 Canadian cents per share. Analysts had expected 62 Canadian cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. ($1 = 1.3287 Canadian dollars)"

0.23219076000332," Part of Keystone oil pipeline remains shut after potential leak (Reuters) - A portion of TransCanada Corp’s Keystone oil pipeline remained shut on Thursday for investigation of a possible leak on its right-of-way near St. Louis, Missouri, a company spokesman said. TransCanada shut the pipeline on Wednesday between Steele City, Nebraska and Patoka, Illinois and sent crews to assess the situation, spokesman Terry Cunha said in an email. The 590,000 barrels-per-day Keystone pipeline is a critical artery taking Canadian crude from northern Alberta to U.S. refineries. Two pipelines operating near the release site will be excavated on Friday to determine the source of the leak, said Darius Kirkwood, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Transportation’s Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. The agency is monitoring the response to the reported leak, he said. Canadian pipelines are already congested because of expanding production in recent years, forcing the Alberta provincial government to order production cuts starting last month. Canadian heavy oil has attracted greater demand following U.S. sanctions against Venezuela’s state oil company. The discount on Canadian heavy crude compared to U.S. light oil widened to $10.15 per barrel on Thursday morning from $9.40 earlier, according to Net Energy Exchange. TransCanada shares eased 0.2 percent to C$55.98 in Toronto. An official with the Missouri Department of Natural Resources said on Wednesday that the release of oil had stopped and it planned to find the leak on Thursday.

5.096599368075718," Enbridge restores some natgas flows on damaged TETCO pipe in Ohio Jan 28 (Reuters) - Enbridge Inc restored southbound natural gas flows over the weekend through parts of its Texas Eastern (TETCO) pipeline in Ohio that were damaged in an explosion last week. The blast last Monday forced drillers using the pipe to reduce output in the Marcellus and Utica shale in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia, the nation’s biggest gas producing region, during the week before a polar vortex is expected to freeze the eastern half of the United States. Total output in the Marcellus and Utica returned to 30 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd), the same as before the pipe blast, which cut production there by around 1 bcfd last week, according to financial data provider Refinitiv. One billion cubic feet is enough gas for about 5 million U.S. homes for a day. TETCO told customers in a notice late Sunday that it increased capacity on a couple of lines around the blast site, but could not say when it would restore full service through the area. Those flows will help deliver much-needed fuel to utilities in the U.S. Midwest as temperatures plunge later this week, boosting gas demand to a forecast daily record high, according to Refinitiv data. Before the Jan. 21 blast, which injured two people and damaged three homes near Summerfield in Noble County in southeastern Ohio, about 1.2 bcfd of gas was flowing south on TETCO from Ohio toward the Gulf of Mexico, according to Refinitiv. After the explosion, however, TETCO started moving up to 0.3 bcfd of gas north into Kentucky and Ohio. But with southbound service restored through parts of the Ohio blast site, about 0.3 bcfd was expected to flow south on the pipeline on Monday. Enbridge said the damaged section of 30-inch (76.2-cm) pipe was built in 1952-53. The 9,029-mile (14,531-km) TETCO pipeline was designed to carry gas from the U.S. Gulf Coast and Texas to high-demand markets in the mid-Atlantic and Northeast, according to the company’s website. TETCO became bidirectional over the past five years, enabling it to also carry gas from the Marcellus and Utica shale, where production is growing rapidly, to markets in the U.S. Midwest and Gulf Coast."
6.332041765365516," Enbridge expects to restore part of damaged Ohio TETCO pipe next week (Reuters) - Enbridge Inc said it plans to restore southbound natural gas flows on part of its Texas Eastern (TETCO) pipeline in Ohio by the middle of next week following an explosion on one of three lines there this week. The shutdown on Monday forced drillers using the pipe to reduce output in the Marcellus and Utica shale in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia, the nation’s biggest gas producing region, a week before a polar vortex is expected to freeze the eastern half of the country. Total output in the Marcellus and Utica slipped from 30 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) before the blast to around 29 bcfd on Monday-Friday, according to financial data provider Refinitiv. One billion cubic feet is enough gas for about 5 million U.S. homes for a day. TETCO told customers in a notice late Thursday it was working to return at least one of the undamaged pipes in the area of the blast and increase north-to-south flows there to around 1 bcfd between Jan. 28-30 from zero now. That would be just days ahead of the forecast deep freeze, which is expected to bring the coldest weather in over a decade to parts of the Midwest and very low temperatures in the Northeast and Southeast, according to meteorologists at Radiant Solutions. Before the blast, which injured two people and damaged three homes near Summerfield in Noble County in southeast Ohio, about 1.2 bcfd of gas was flowing south on TETCO from Ohio toward the Gulf of Mexico, according to Refinitiv. After the explosion, TETCO started moving up to 0.2 bcfd of gas north into Kentucky and Ohio. On the eastern side of the damaged pipe, flows in Greene County in southwest Pennsylvania also reversed direction. About 0.6 bcfd was moving toward the Gulf Coast before the blast. Since then, about 0.5 bcfd has been heading east toward New Jersey. Greene County is one of Pennsylvania’s biggest gas producing counties.

7.938275258793347," U.S. natgas pipeline flows reversed after Enbridge TETCO Ohio pipe blast (Reuters) - Enbridge Inc reversed the direction of natural gas flows on its Texas Eastern (TETCO) pipeline in Ohio after an explosion on one of its lines there on Monday, according to financial data provider Refinitiv. Before the blast, which injured two people and damaged three homes, gas was flowing south through the damaged section of pipe from the Marcellus and Utica shale in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia toward the Gulf Coast, according to Refinitiv and gas traders. After the explosion, however, small amounts of gas started moving north from the Gulf Coast on southern sections of the pipe. This would allow the pipeline to serve customers in states like Tennessee and Kentucky who stopped receiving gas after the explosion. Enbridge said it isolated two other gas pipes near the damaged 30-inch (76.2 cm) line near Summerfield in Noble County in southeast Ohio so crews can safely investigate the integrity of those two lines prior to returning them to service. The Calgary-based company did not estimate when it would return the pipeline to service. Before the incident, drillers were producing over 30 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) of gas in the Marcellus and Utica region. That dropped to around 29 bcfd on Monday-Thursday, according to Refinitiv. One billion cubic feet is enough gas for about 5 million U.S. homes for a day. In counties south of the damaged pipe, like Athens and Scioto in southern Ohio and Bath and Boyle in Kentucky, about 1.2 bcfd of gas was flowing south on TETCO toward the Gulf of Mexico on Sunday, according to Refinitiv. But since the blast, almost 0.1 bcfd has been flowing north on the pipe through those counties on Tuesday-Thursday. On the eastern side of the damaged pipe, flows in Greene County in southwest Pennsylvania also reversed direction. About 0.6 bcfd of gas was moving toward the Gulf Coast on Sunday before the blast. Since then, however, about 0.5 bcfd has been heading east toward New Jersey. Greene County is one of Pennsylvania’s biggest gas producing counties. Enbridge said the damaged section of pipe was built in 1952-53 and an inspection of the line was performed in 2012 with no remediation needed.

The blast, which injured two people who lived nearby and damaged three homes, occurred on TETCO’s 30-inch (76.2 cm) line about two miles south of Summerfield in Noble County in southeast Ohio at around 10:40 a.m. EST (1540 GMT), the Calgary-based company said in a statement. Before the incident, drillers were producing about 30 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) of gas in the Marcellus and Utica region. That dropped to just 28 bcfd on Wednesday, according to Refinitiv, a financial data provider. One billion cubic feet is enough gas for about 5 million U.S. homes for a day. At the time of the blast, gas was flowing through TETCO from the Marcellus and Utica shale fields south toward the Gulf of Mexico, according to gas traders. The amount of gas moving through TETCO south of the damaged pipe in Athens and Scioto Counties in southern Ohio dropped from around 1.2 bcfd on Monday to less than 0.1 bcfd on Wednesday, according to Refinitiv data. In Bath, Monroe and Boyle Counties in Kentucky, flows also fell from over 1.0 bcfd on Monday to about 0.1 bcfd Wednesday. In Pennsylvania, meanwhile, flows in Greene County in the southwest corner of the state reversed direction from 0.6 bcfd moving West on Monday to 0.4 bcfd heading east on Wednesday. Greene County is one of Pennsylvania’s biggest gas producing counties. Officials at Enbridge could not say when the damaged section of pipe would return to service.

It said the fire had been contained, but that residents near the incident had been evacuated. The Calgary-based company said it had “immediately started to shut in and isolate that section of pipeline” and was cooperating with authorities in its response. The U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration has been notified about the explosion and has dispatched an investigator to the scene, an agency spokesman said. Enbridge’s Texas Eastern pipeline carries natural gas from the U.S. Gulf Coast and Texas to high-demand markets in the mid-Atlantic and Northeast, according to Enbridge’s website. It was not immediately clear if the shut-in would impact customers in some of the most densely populated areas in the United States during a particularly severe cold snap. A spokesman for Pennsylvania’s major power supplier, PECO, said late on Monday it was not experiencing any disruptions related to the explosion. A fire on an Enbridge gas pipeline in northern British Columbia late last year led to supply disruptions throughout the Pacific Coast, forcing a number of Washington state refineries to temporarily shut or curb operations."

A number of lines on Enbridge Inc’s Mainline system, which carries about 1.2 million barrels per day of crude and other liquids, and TransCanada Corp’s 590,000 bpd Keystone crude pipeline were hit by power outages on Tuesday in the western Canadian province. TransCanada’s Keystone pipeline was operational on Wednesday after it experienced a brief outage due to power disruptions, the company said in an emailed statement on Wednesday. Enbridge said its mainline system, which includes Lines 1, 2a, 3, 4 and 67, as well as Line 13, are back in service. The province’s primary utility SaskPower restored electricity to pipeline operations there, but Enbridge said intermittent service outages may still occur. Western Canadian Select (WCS) heavy oil prices strengthened on news of the restart, dealers said, trading at $23.50 a barrel below West Texas Intermediate benchmark prices. Prices traded at a discount of about $24.50 on Tuesday. Both pipeline systems originate in Alberta, where most of Canada’s oil is produced.

A number of lines on the Enbridge Inc ENB.TO Mainline system, which carries crude and other liquids, were hit by power outages in the Western Canadian province of Saskatchewan due to severe weather, the company said Tuesday. TransCanada Corp's TRP.TO 590,000 barrel-per-day crude Keystone pipeline was also shut due to the outage, according to a shipper on the line and traders. There was no estimated restart timeline for the line, one source said, citing a notice to shippers. The company did not respond to a request for comment. The outages, though temporary, are just the latest constraints to hit Western Canadian oil producers already struggling to export crude due to full pipelines as production has surged to a record at more than 4.6 million barrels a day in 2018. Both systems originate in Alberta, where most of Canada’s oil is produced. Enbridge, for its part, said it will remain in contact with SaskPower, that province’s primary utility, through the night “to evaluate the possibility of starting the lines earlier.” The Mainline system ships about 1.2 million bpd. The Alberta government on Sunday imposed mandatory output cuts of 8.7 percent, or 325,000 bpd, until excess crude in storage is drawn down. The cuts will begin in January. Western Canadian Select (WCS) heavy oil prices weakened on the news, dealers said, closing at $29.25 a barrel below West Texas Intermediate CLc1 benchmark prices. In October, that discount hit a record of $52 below U.S. prices, but had narrowed to a $19 discount on Monday after the production cuts were announced. Traders said they expect the outages to be brief. “If the lines are not up tomorrow, I’m sure folks will start to get nervous,” one shipper on the lines said. TransCanada’s Keystone line runs to Steele City, Nebraska and from there to other U.S. markets. Decreased power consumption on that line was observed at about 9:30 a.m. EST (1430 GMT), according to market intelligence firm Genscape. Enbridge said its lines 1, 2a, 3, 4, 13 and 67 would be shut through the night, as SaskPower anticipates power will remain down until at least until Wednesday morning."
13.220437186770079," U.S. says Enbridge can start more of Ohio-Michigan Nexus natgas pipeline (Reuters) - U.S. energy regulators on Tuesday approved Canadian energy company Enbridge Inc's ENB.TO request to put more of its $2.6 billion Nexus natural gas pipeline from Ohio to Michigan into service. In a filing, the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) said it approved the company’s request to put the Wadsworth compressor in Medina County, Ohio, into service. Enbridge sought FERC permission to put the compressor into service on Oct. 19. Nexus is one of several gas pipelines designed to connect growing output from the Marcellus and Utica shale basins in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio with customers in other parts of the United States and Canada. Earlier in October, FERC allowed Enbridge to put facilities into service that would enable Nexus to transport about 0.97 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd). One billion cubic feet of gas is enough to fuel about 5 million homes for a day. Once the 255-mile (410-km) Nexus project is fully in service, it will be able to carry up to 1.5 bcfd of gas from the Marcellus and Utica shale fields to the U.S. Midwest and Gulf Coast and to Ontario in Canada. Nexus is a partnership between Enbridge and Michigan energy company DTE Energy Inc DTE.N. When it began construction of Nexus in late 2017, Enbridge estimated it would be able to complete the project in the third quarter of 2018. Enbridge said it completed Nexus in September when it asked FERC for permission to put part of the pipeline into service. New pipelines built to carry gas from Appalachia have enabled shale drillers there to boost output to an estimated record high of around 29.8 bcfd in November from 26.1 bcfd during the same month a year ago. That represents about 36 percent of the nation’s total dry gas output of 83.2 bcfd expected on average in 2018. The Appalachia region produced just 1.6 bcfd, or 3 percent of the country’s total production, in 2008."

13.120961257721719," Enbridge seeks to put more of Ohio TEAL natgas pipe into service Oct 24 (Reuters) - Canadian energy company Enbridge Inc on Wednesday sought permission from U.S. energy regulators to put the remaining part of its Texas Eastern Appalachian Lease (TEAL) Phase 1 natural gas pipeline in Ohio into service. In a filing with the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), Enbridge said it expects to complete work on the last part of the $200 million TEAL project by Oct. 26 and would like FERC to approve of its request by Oct. 30. The facilities Enbridge is seeking to put into service include about 4.4 miles (7.1 kilometers) of new 36-inch (91-centimeter) pipe and other equipment. TEAL is one of several gas pipelines designed to connect growing output in the Marcellus and Utica shale basins in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio with customers in other parts of the United States and Canada. Enbridge put part of TEAL into service on Oct. 9. The 0.95-billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) TEAL was designed to provide additional supplies for Enbridge’s $2.6 billion NEXUS gas pipeline from Ohio to Michigan. One billion cubic feet of gas is enough to fuel about 5 million homes for a day. The company put part of the 1.5-bcfd NEXUS into service on Oct. 13 and is currently seeking FERC permission to start more of the project. Once it enters full service, the 255-mile NEXUS will carry gas from the Marcellus and Utica shale fields to U.S. Midwest and Gulf Coast and Ontario in Canada.

10.604199453269368," Enbridge says Canada natgas pipe to restart in mid-November VANCOUVER (Reuters) - Enbridge Inc said on Friday that it is preparing to start construction on a damaged natural gas pipeline in British Columbia and expects it be fixed by mid-November, though it and an adjacent line will both operate at reduced pressure. The pipeline was shut down after it ruptured earlier this month causing gas to ignite, leading to the evacuation of about 100 people in northeast British Columbia and disrupting refinery operations hundreds of miles away in the state of Washington. Enbridge said it expects the 36-inch line to be repaired and operating by mid-November, pending regulator approval, though at 80 percent of its normal pressure. An adjacent 30-inch line was returned to service at reduced pressure last week. The Calgary-based company said once both pipes are back in service, it expects capacity on its TSouth system to range from 0.9 to 1.3 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) through the balance of the winter gas season. The pipeline incident cut gas supplies to Fortis BC, a gas utility in British Columbia, and Puget Sound Energy in Washington state, and caused at least three refineries in Washington to shut or curb operations, sending fuel prices soaring. By Sunday, the amount of natural gas moving from British Columbia to Washington state through the Sumas hub had edged up to 0.3 bcfd from 0.2 bcfd last Friday. In the 30 days prior to the Oct. 9 blast, the amount of gas flowing through the hub averaged about 1.1 bcfd, according to data from Refinitiv. Enbridge said it is committed to getting its TSouth system back to operating at full capacity in a safe manner."
8.174064453421414," Enbridge says one natural gas pipeline in British Columbia operational after rupture (Reuters) - Canada’s Enbridge Inc on Thursday said a 30-inch natural gas pipeline in northern British Columbia has become operational after being shut down due to a fire in an adjacent line, which led to supply disruptions in the U.S. state of Washington. Enbridge, Canada’s largest pipeline operator, isolated and depressurized a 36-inch (91-cm) pipeline, which carries gas to the Pacific Northwest, after it ruptured on Tuesday evening causing gas to ignite. An adjacent 30-inch pipeline was also depressurized for safety. The Canadian regulator, National Energy Board (NEB), on Wednesday night approved the restart of the 30-inch line, which runs parallel to the impacted line, after a comprehensive integrity assessment, Enbridge said. “Following the NEB order, Enbridge initiated our restart plan to safely and gradually bring the line’s pressure up to approximately 80 percent of normal operating capacity. Natural gas is now safely flowing to our customers through the single line,” the company said in a statement. Enbridge, however, added that it did not have an estimate on how long it will take to complete the investigation process, or for repair and return of the impacted 36-inch line back into service. The incident forced various refineries in Washington to shut or curb operations as natural gas supply to the facilities was disrupted, which led to a surge in fuel prices in the Pacific Northwest region and across the West Coast. The rupture occurred near the city of Prince George in British Columbia’s northeast. About 100 people were evacuated from their homes in a nearby Aboriginal community on Tuesday as a precautionary measure. There were no injuries."

Once this is safely completed, some of the capacity would be restored, Enbridge said. Royal Dutch Shell had said it was “proactively shutting units down” at its Puget Sound refinery in Washington state due to the incident and Phillips 66 said it was adjusting operations at its Ferndale refinery, also in Washington state. FortisBC, British Columbia’s energy utility, declared force majeure on Wednesday on several of its rate schedules which informed shippers their delivery of gas was being curtailed. The company estimates about 70 percent of its roughly 1 million customers could lose gas supply due to the incident. FortisBC earlier asked customers to avoid non-essential use of gas and said there could be service disruptions. Puget Sound Energy, Washington state’s energy utility, issued a similar notice. Enbridge earlier said it was maintaining a 1 km (0.6 mile) evacuation zone around the site and was working with regulators on investigating the cause of the incident. NEB said it had sent a team to the site and was working with the company and other affected parties on the emergency response and investigation. The rupture occurred near the city of Prince George in British Columbia’s northeast. About 100 people were evacuated from their homes in a nearby Aboriginal community on Tuesday as a precautionary measure. There were no injuries.

-9.52647946957044," Enbridge: no plans to use own security during Line 3 construction ST. PAUL, Minn. (Reuters) - Enbridge Inc will not hire private security during construction of its Line 3 oil pipeline as it seeks to avoid the violence that erupted between protesters and security at the Dakota Access Pipeline (DAPL), a senior Enbridge official said on Friday. “No one wants a Dakota Access situation,” said Guy Jarvis, Enbridge’s executive vice-president of liquids pipelines and major projects, in an interview. “We certainly don’t plan to be engaging our own security efforts as a replacement or a supplement to the official law enforcement agencies. That’s different.” The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission on Thursday approved a rebuild of Line 3.. Opponents vowed to stop the project, comparing their efforts to DAPL protests. Protests of DAPL initially were peaceful but tensions rose after protesters were pepper-sprayed and attacked by security dogs. In late 2016, the number of protesters multiplied and they were hit with tear gas and water cannons in freezing weather. Enbridge has a minority stake in Energy Transfer Partners’ DAPL pipeline. “We’re here to make sure that nobody gets hurt,” Jarvis said. “If you employ your own security to do (law enforcement), you’re broadening your responsibilities to an area where we don’t believe we should go.” Enbridge shares rose 7 percent on Friday. Winona LaDuke, executive director of the Honor the Earth activist group, said she is “pretty skeptical” that Enbridge will leave security to police. During DAPL protests, LaDuke said she asked Enbridge to get involved, to no avail. “I asked them to de-escalate that situation,” she said. Jarvis said Enbridge expects to have full authorization to build by November. Construction could start in early 2019. A possible surplus of Canadian pipeline space in a few years, factoring in Line 3, the Ottawa-backed Trans Mountain and TransCanada Corp’s Keystone XL is not a significant risk to Line 3’s business case, although each pipeline company will bear some brunt, Jarvis said. Currently, space is so tight on Enbridge’s Mainline network that it rations space to shippers, called apportionment. Enbridge proposed a modified system in May before withdrawing it over concerns by oil shippers. This time, the company intends to work through a National Energy Board (NEB) regulatory process to find a solution this year, Jarvis said. “There is such a gulf in views that no matter what we do at our own discretion, we’re going to get challenged at the NEB,” he said. “We hope to come up with something that has a degree of support from shippers.”"

(Reuters) - A Minnesota regulator on Thursday approved a certificate of need for Enbridge Inc to rebuild its Line 3 oil pipeline, angering environmentalists but offering hope to Western Canadian oil producers that have struggled to move crude oil to refiners. The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission’s decision clears the final major hurdle, pending possible appeals, in Enbridge’s three-year effort to rebuild its aging, corroded 1,031-mile (1,660-km) pipeline that runs from Alberta in western Canada to Wisconsin. Shares of Calgary, Alberta-based Enbridge closed up 3.7 percent in Toronto. The commission also approved a route that closely follows Enbridge’s preference and will take Line 3 over a new corridor for part of its path. The certificate of need has conditions, including that Enbridge make a financial guarantee to clean up any environmental damage and that it remove at landowners’ request pipeline that is no longer in use. Pipeline bottlenecks have steepened a price discount for Western Canadian heavy crude this year. Refiners in Minnesota and surrounding states say Line 3 is necessary to increase crude supplies. Shouts from Native Americans and environmental activists interrupted the meeting. “Shame on you, you cowards!” one woman shouted before breaking into tears. Environmental groups and some indigenous communities oppose the project over concerns about spills and impact on tribal wild rice harvesting areas. “What they have done to us today is egregious,” said Winona LaDuke, executive director of Honor the Earth activist group. “They have gotten their Standing Rock. We will do everything that is needed to stop this pipeline.” The Standing Rock tribe led opposition in 2016 to the Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota, one of the most bitterly contested energy projects in years. It was eventually built. The coalition of Line 3 opponents is likely to formally request that the commission reconsider its approval, said Joe Plumer, lawyer for White Earth Nation. Business and labor groups say the $7 billion project, of which $2.5 billion would be spent in Minnesota, will create jobs and tax revenue. “It’s going to give everybody a real boost,” said Bob Schoneberger, who runs a piping contractor business in Duluth, Minnesota. Enbridge Chief Executive Al Monaco said in a statement that he was pleased with the commission’s decisions, and said the project’s cost was materially unchanged. He said he continues to expect the rebuilt pipeline to begin service in the second half of 2019. Line 3, which began service in 1968, operates at half its capacity. Its replacement would allow it to return to approved capacity of 760,000 barrels per day. “That pipeline is an accident waiting to happen,” said Commissioner Dan Lipschultz. “It feels like a gun to our head that compels us to approve a new line ... but the gun is real and it’s loaded.” Several commissioners voiced doubts that demand for crude oil and refined products such as gasoline would grow enough to warrant the pipeline. But Enbridge’s rationing of demand from oil shippers for space on Line 3 was more convincing of a need to rebuild, said Chairwoman Nancy Lange. The rebuilt Line 3 will follow the existing pipeline path partway through Minnesota, before veering south to bypass Leech Lake reserve and avoid a need to shut down the pipeline for up to one year during construction. The path of a short stretch near Fond du Lac reserve will be determined by negotiations between the tribe and Enbridge. Tribes in the area had said Enbridge’s preferred route was the worst of numerous options. Fond du Lac lawyer Seth Bichler told the commission that the tribes preferred a longer route to the south that would avoid more sensitive land. Recognized parties, including Enbridge, environmental and indigenous groups, have 20 days from the time a written order is issued - likely in a couple of weeks - to ask the commission to reconsider. If such an application is denied, a party can then appeal to Minnesota’s appeals court. Line 3 also requires 29 additional permits from local, state and federal levels, Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton said in a statement. “Approvals are by no means assured,” he said."

PAUL, Minnesota (Reuters) - Commissioners on a Minnesota regulatory board questioned crude oil demand for Enbridge Inc’s Line 3 pipeline on Tuesday, ahead of an expected decision this week on whether work can proceed on a proposed expansion of the line. Enbridge wants to replace the aging 1,031-mile (1,660-km) pipeline that runs from Alberta to Wisconsin, but it needs approval from the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission, which must decide whether the project is needed, and the route. Bottlenecks in Alberta have steepened a price discount for its heavy crude this year. Line 3, placed into service in 1968, operates at half its capacity due to integrity concerns. Its replacement would allow it to return to approved capacity of 760,000 barrels per day. Commissioners spent part of the morning discussing whether the project is necessary. Commissioner Dan Lipschultz said he felt “frustration” having to rely on forecasts provided by Enbridge based on rising oil production, rather than on refiners’ demand. Enbridge lawyer Eric Swanson noted that global demand is growing, and that Enbridge apportions demand on Line 3 - transporting less oil than shippers request. “We think it shows a compelling case that Line 3 plus the expansion will be fully utilized,” he said. Lipschultz asked Swanson whether it would be reasonable to approve Line 3 for lesser capacity of 500,000 bpd, to which Swanson said ‘no.’ Commissioner Matt Schuerger said data for state refineries suggest little idle capacity, although the state’s largest refiner, Flint Hills Resources, has said Line 3 is badly needed. “They’re getting oil clearly,” Schuerger said. “The oil is getting to market somehow,” replied Swanson, representing Enbridge. “The question is what is the most reliable, efficient means of getting it there.” Environmental groups and some indigenous communities oppose the project over concerns about spills and damage to tribal wild rice harvesting areas. Business and labor groups say the project, to cost $2.5 billion in Minnesota, would create jobs and tax revenue. Mysti Babineau, a member of Red Lake band, wore a baseball cap with a message, “Love water, not oil.” The potential environmental cost is too great and fossil fuels-based energy is on its way out, she said, comparing it to manufacturing VCRs. “It’s outdated technology,” she said. Line 3 supporters wore neon green T-shirts with the message, “We support safe energy transportation.” One of them, grandmother Cheryl Grover, crocheted a scarf as she listened. Line 3 would pass under her farm near Shevlin, Minnesota, following Enbridge’s preferred route. “Because public utilities pay so much (tax), we pay less,” she said."

5.807036770270154," Enbridge endorses two alternatives for Great Lakes pipeline replacement (Reuters) - Enbridge Inc on Friday endorsed either an underwater tunnel or trench to replace a section of its 65-year-old energy pipeline that travels under a stretch of the U.S. Great Lakes in Michigan. Some local officials want the line removed to prevent the potential for a spill into lake waters. The state of Michigan proposed moving the line into a tunnel under the lake bed and asked the company to evaluate it and other alternatives. The Canadian pipeline operator said a tunnel would cost between $350 million and $500 million and take five to six years to assemble. A concrete-lined tunnel built as much as 100 feet below the lake bed and 350 feet below the surface of the lake would prevent an oil spill from reaching the water, the company said. The alternative, an open-cut trench, would cost between $250 million and $300 million and take four to five years to build, the company said. That method would prevent spills by constructing a second 36-inch outer pipe around a 30-inch energy pipeline. The outer pipe would have a leak detection system, Enbridge said. Building either a tunnel and a trench would require 15 state and federal permits, with oversight by the Army Corps of Engineers and Michigan environmental agencies. In April, the pipeline was damaged by a boat anchor, raising fears of a potential spill in an environmentally sensitive area. The 20-inch Line 5 pipeline carries crude oil and natural gas liquids on twin lines running from Superior, Wisconsin, to Sarnia, Ontario. A portion of it runs 4.5 miles (7.2 km) under the Straits of Mackinac, which links Lake Michigan and Lake Huron. Enbridge concluded that one proposed option, using horizontal directional drilling to push a pipe underground, was not technically feasible."

6.3856272476525895," Enbridge takes steps on pipeline policy after BP complains WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - Canada’s biggest pipeline operator, Enbridge Inc, said on Monday it was taking steps to address complaints from oil shipper BP PLC about abrupt changes it made in allocating space on its Mainline system. The company announced the policy change late last month before reversing it last week, after it caused panic among shippers and dramatically increased a discount on Canadian heavy crude. Enbridge had intended to change how it verifies shippers’ oil supplies before dividing up capacity on the Mainline to prevent shippers from overestimating how much crude they had to move, a problem known as “air barrels.” In a letter to Canadian regulator the National Energy Board (NEB), Enbridge said it would not use the revised system in August, and had no plans to do so thereafter. The company also said, in response to BP’s concerns, that it would not implement any further changes during the trading period - the first three weeks of the month prior to shipment when sales and scheduling decisions are made. Enbridge said it would give shippers at least one calendar month’s notice of future changes. Enbridge said in light of its actions, there should be no need for the NEB to continue a process of receiving industry feedback on the situation. BP could not be immediately reached."

8.72480951497253," BP complains to Canada regulator about Enbridge oil pipeline actions (Reuters) - Oil producer BP Plc BP.L complained to Canada's National Energy Board (NEB) regulator about Enbridge Inc's ENB.TO implementation and then abrupt reversal of new rules for shipping crude on its Mainline pipeline system, NEB documents showed on Thursday. Enbridge notified shippers late last month that it would introduce a supply verification procedure to determine each company’s volumes on the Mainline, but then scrapped the policy early this week. The NEB said in a letter on Thursday to BP and Enbridge that it would establish a process to hear comments from both companies and anyone else this month. Enbridge’s initial notice of the change caused the discount on Canadian heavy crude against the North American benchmark West Texas Intermediate to widen sharply in sparse trade as shippers worried about transport constrictions. The discount then narrowed rapidly on Monday when Enbridge reversed course. “Unnecessarily injecting uncertainty in how services would be provided to shippers .. is shocking and egregious,” said Jennifer Geggie, vice-president of global oil Americas at BP Products North America, a subsidiary of BP, in a June 6 letter to the NEB. Geggie further noted the reversal was announced during the main trading window for July 2018 shipments and changing pipeline procedure at that point “could cause unintended consequences which could materially harm shippers.” BP also said there was a lack of clarity on whether or not the new supply verification procedures would apply after July 2018, creating further uncertainty for shippers. Enbridge declined to comment on BP’s complaint and said it would file its response with the NEB “in due course.” The Mainline is part of the largest crude oil transportation network in Canada, funneling oil from Alberta to U.S. refineries. Enbridge has long sought more efficient ways to move oil on the network and prevent shippers from overestimating the product they have to move as they compete for space."

10.623184980599177," Oil vs wild rice: Enbridge, opponents gear up final U.S. pipeline push CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Canada's Enbridge Inc ENB.TO faces an indefinite delay to its biggest-ever capital project if a U.S. state regulator denies its preferred pipeline route through Minnesota, but a victory would spell relief for Canadian oil shippers and northern U.S. refiners. Some pipeline opponents, which include environmental and Native American groups, are trying to convince the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (PUC) to kill the project. Others oppose only Enbridge’s proposed new pipeline route, saying it would consume more land and threaten Native Americans’ traditional harvest of wild rice from wetlands. Enbridge wants to replace the aging 1,031-mile (1,660-km) Line 3 pipeline that runs from Alberta to Wisconsin. Worsening bottlenecks in Alberta have steepened a price discount for its heavy crude, and several pipeline projects that could ease the situation face stiff opposition. Line 3, placed into service in 1968, operates at half its capacity due to integrity concerns. Its replacement would allow it to return to approved capacity of 760,000 barrels per day. Regulatory approval may be pivotal to restoring investor confidence in Enbridge, whose stock is down 18 percent this year, partly on debt concerns, even as the S&P TSX energy index .SPTTEN is up slightly. The PUC is set to decide late this month whether the total $7 billion project is necessary and if so, what route it should take. An administrative law judge recommended in April the expanded pipeline should follow the existing route. Enbridge prefers a new route that bypasses an indigenous reservation, avoids some ecologically sensitive areas and prevents a pipeline shutdown of up to one year. It hopes to start construction in Minnesota in November. A different route would require a detailed evaluation that would set back plans to start the added oil flow by late 2019, said Guy Jarvis, Enbridge’s executive vice-president of liquids pipelines and major projects. “A ruling by the PUC of anything other than our preferred route is clearly going to put the timeline for this project in jeopardy,” he told Reuters in an interview. The late stages of Enbridge’s biggest-ever, three-year outreach effort will marshal Minnesota’s refiners, business and labor groups to lobby state legislators and other “influencers” for the project, Jarvis said. To those groups, Line 3 means a $2.5 billion investment in the state, more jobs and less crude traveling by rail. “It’s a full-court press,” Jarvis said. “.. They can carry the message of what it means in Minnesota better than we can.” For Flint Hills Resources, a unit of Koch Industries, Line 3 is critical to supplying its Minnesota refinery with adequate volumes of Canadian crude to produce fuel and asphalt, said spokesman Jake Reint. “We’re not getting the crude we need right now.” Enbridge’s opponents have their own gameplan. Aboriginal environment group Honor the Earth hopes to sway Minnesota Gov. Mark Dayton to help kill the project. The governor has no formal role in the commission’s deliberations, but carries valuable influence, said Tara Houska, national campaigns director for Honor the Earth. The state commerce department has already said Enbridge has not shown the project is needed. A spokesperson for Dayton said the governor has made clear that the PUC operates independently of his administration. Last month, Dayton vetoed a bill that would have allowed Enbridge to bypass the PUC. Honor the Earth argues that expanding the pipeline tramples on tribal rights to harvest wild rice, hunt and fish in the area. The wild rice issue is “critical to this decision,” said Catherine Collentine of Sierra Club, another environmentalist group opposing Line 3. The company will work to protect wild rice areas during pipeline construction and operation, Enbridge spokeswoman Suzanne Wilton said. The Canadian oil industry faces opposition to other pipeline projects, and views approval for this one as a badly needed victory. “It’s very important for the industry to prove they can, not (only) get lines built, but lines increased,” said Kevin Brent, vice-president of investments at BlueSky Equities, which owns Enbridge stock. A loss in Minnesota “would be terrible for investor sentiment,” he said."

9.181825760084424," North American pipeline operators restructure after tax change (Reuters) - Pipeline operators Enbridge Inc ENB.TO, Williams Cos WMB.N and Cheniere Energy Inc LNG.A said on Thursday they would restructure after a U.S. rule change removed a key tax benefit for publicly traded partnerships controlled by those companies. Williams said it would buy all common units of its master limited partnership (MLP) Williams Partners WPZ.N in a deal valued at $10.5 billion. Enbridge said it would buy its independent units including Spectra Energy Partners SEP.N and Enbridge Energy Partners EEP.N as well as its pipeline assets and bring then under a single listed entity for C$11.4 billion ($8.94 billion). Cheniere said it will buy out shares it does not already hold in Cheniere Partners Holdings CQH.N for about $6.54 billion. MLPs are tax-exempt corporate structures that pay out profit to investors in dividend-style distributions. In 2016, a U.S. Appeals Court ruled that energy regulators were allowing these companies to benefit from a “double recovery” of taxes. In March, the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) said the companies, largely oil and natural gas pipeline firms, will no longer be allowed to recover an income tax allowance as part of the fees they charge to shippers under a “cost of service” rate structure. “I would expect more of them to be rolled up in a similar fashion. If the reaction to Enbridge is stronger you might see TransCanada do the same thing but it’s not nearly as material to them,” said Ryan Bushell, president and portfolio manager at Newhaven Asset Management. The transaction will not hurt Enbridge’s three-year financial outlook, the company said. “Under the newly changed FERC tax policy, holding certain interstate pipelines in MLP structures is highly unfavorable to unitholders and is no longer advantageous,” Enbridge said. The Calgary-based company, which has been trying to recast itself as a pipeline utility, has been under pressure to sell non-core assets and reduce its debt of more than $60 billion as of Dec. 31. “This is the first step of the board taking control and taking steps to put the company in good standing,” Bushell said. The company has been saddled with debt following its $28 billion takeover of U.S.-based Spectra Energy last year. Earlier this month, it sold some assets worth $2.5 billion. Rolling up Spectra will allow Enbridge to mitigate impact from the tax related changes by 21 percent, compared with a zero percent benefit if long-haul assets are held in a MLP structure, analysts at Tudor Pickering and Holt said.

Enbridge has been under pressure to reduce leverage, one of the factors that has weighed on its share price. Selling assets would also help the company become a pure pipeline utility. The company announced two sales on Wednesday that will help it exceed its target for $3 billion in divestitures this year, but more deals are being discussed. “A good example of where we’re getting a lot of inbound interest is on the Canadian (gathering and processing) assets in whole or in part,” Chief Executive Al Monaco said on a quarterly conference call on Thursday. “Based on what we see at this point, we could move on additional asset sales, which would create added flexibility on (the) financial side.” On Wednesday, Enbridge said it would sell a U.S. gas pipelines business and part of its renewable energy portfolio for a combined $2.5 billion to reduce debt, which stood at $61 billion as of end-2017. The company has also received bids as high as C$4.5 billion for the Canadian midstream assets it is selling as part of its debt-reduction efforts, Reuters reported. U.S.-listed shares of Enbridge ENB.N rose 2.3 percent to $32.85 and its Toronto-listed stock added 1.4 percent to C$42.03. The Toronto shares touched their highest in nearly two months.

14.483258544162513," Enbridge hits debt target with $2.5 billion pipeline, renewables sale (Reuters) - Enbridge Inc ENB.TO will sell a U.S. gas pipelines business and part of its renewable energy portfolio for a combined $2.5 billion, the Canadian pipeline operator said on Wednesday, achieving the first step in its debt reduction plan. The Calgary-based company is continuing to shop its Canadian midstream assets and has received initial bids valuing the portfolio as high as C$4.5 billion ($3.5 billion), people familiar with the situation told Reuters. Enbridge Chief Executive Officer Al Monaco told reporters on Wednesday that the company has not received any formal bids for the Canadian midstream assets and declined to comment on indications of interest. Enbridge has been under pressure to sell non-core assets since its $28 billion takeover of U.S.-based Spectra Energy last year. Its long-term debt pile of $60.87 billion as of Dec. 31 has also caused alarm at credit rating agencies. [bit.ly/2EwyF5O] The company said in November it expected to raise upwards of C$3 billion from divestments in 2018, the first sales from a pool of non-core assets worth C$10 billion. The deals announced on Wednesday brought Enbridge close to that goal. The company said it had sealed a C$1.75 billion deal with the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPPIB) for a 49 percent stake in wind and solar power assets in North America and Germany. The company will also sell Midcoast Operating LP, its U.S. gas pipelines unit, to an affiliate of private equity firm ArcLight Capital Partners LLC for $1.12 billion. Midcoast operates facilities to process and treat natural gas and natural gas liquids. “This transaction, in addition to our other funding actions taken, accelerates funding for our secured capital program and gives us increased financial flexibility,” Monaco said in a statement announcing the CPPIB deal. Enbridge said it may yet monetize or sell the remaining renewable stake. Banking sources suggested that Enbridge had offered all its renewables assets for sale to begin with, asking potential buyers to propose the best deal. The company separately said Wednesday that it had filed a formal response to a Minnesota judge’s recommendation that its Line 3 pipeline replacement go ahead but follow the existing right-of-way through the state instead of Enbridge’s preferred route. Enbridge said that if it were to follow the recommended route, the existing pipeline would need to be shut down for nine to 12 months, “negatively impacting Minnesota’s energy supply.” The C$8.2 billion Line 3 replacement would double capacity on the pipeline, which extends from Alberta to Wisconsin, providing much needed relief to Canada’s oil producers who are struggling with a lack of transportation capacity to get their crude to market. In an interview with Reuters, Bruce Hogg, head of power and renewables at CPPIB, said its longstanding history with Enbridge and the fund’s desire to grow its renewables exposure led to the agreement. “We were having conversations about a broader arrangement and the ability to grow value over time, which was a much more sellable package (to Enbridge) than they initially envisaged,” he said. The pension fund will also provide C$500 million of capital to help finance outstanding construction related to the German offshore wind scheme, and it signed a 50-50 joint venture with Enbridge to invest in future European offshore wind projects. CPPIB also purchased U.S. utility NextEra Energy Partners' NEP.N wind and solar assets in Ontario last month for about $582 million. CIBC Capital Markets and law firm Dentons advised Enbridge on the renewables deal, the statement said. RBC Capital Markets and Citigroup advised CPPIB, sources familiar with the matter said. Citi, along with Norton Rose Fulbright LLP, worked with Enbridge on the U.S. midstream sale. Enbridge’s Toronto shares closed up 2.65 percent at C$41.48. ($1 = 1.2922 Canadian dollars)"

14.483258544162513," Enbridge receives bids as high as $3.5 billion for Canada midstream assets: sources TORONTO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Enbridge Inc has received higher-than-expected bids for the Canadian midstream assets it is selling as part of its debt-reduction efforts, with initial bids valuing the portfolio as high as C$4.5 billion ($3.5 billion), people familiar with the situation told Reuters. Keyera Corp, Pembina Pipeline Corp and Husky Energy Inc’s midstream unit are among suitors that placed preliminary bids ahead of a recent deadline, the people added, declining to be named as the matter is private. Canadian pension fund CPPIB-backed Wolf Midstream has made a bid for some of the assets on offer, and Inter Pipeline and KKR & Co were also said to be interested in the assets, though it was not clear if they submitted bids, the people said. More than two dozen parties took a look at the assets in the auction, underpinning the appeal for stable cash-flow generating pipeline assets, one of the people said. Reuters previously reported that the midstream assets could fetch as much as C$4 billion. Enbridge, Canada’s biggest pipeline operator, is raising funds to pay down debt incurred from the $28 billion Spectra acquisition, launched in 2016. It has set a target of C$3 billion in asset sales this year, but including the two deals announced on Wednesday, it is poised to blow past that goal. A potential C$4.5 billion sale of its midstream assets, if successful, could take its asset sale proceeds this year to over C$7.5 billion, helping the company to aggressively pay down its debt. Enbridge is working with Royal Bank of Canada on the sale. Enbridge, RBC, KKR, Inter Pipeline and Husky declined to comment. Keyera, Pembina and CPPIB did not immediately respond to request for comment. Enbridge has identified about C$10 billion in non-core assets that it could sell over time, to help address long term debt standing at $60. 87 billion as of Dec. 31."

20.309016532229457," Enbridge shares fall on Minnesota pipeline route ruling TORONTO, April 24 (Reuters) - Shares of Canadian pipeline operator Enbridge Inc dropped more than 4 percent on Tuesday after a Minnesota judge agreed the Line 3 oil pipeline replacement project was needed, but rejected the company’s preferred route. Enbridge has proposed a C$8.2 billion ($6.4 billion)replacement of its existing Line 3 export pipeline, which extends from Alberta into Wisconsin, doubling capacity on the line to 760,000 barrels per day. But the project has run into opposition in Minnesota from the state, along with Native American tribes and environmental activists who have questioned whether the replacement is needed. Administrative Law Judge Ann O’Reilly, of the Minnesota Office of Administrative Hearings for the Public Utilities Commission ruled late on Monday that Enbridge should be issued permission for the replacement, but said the company should use its existing right of way, adding hurdles to the project’s construction. Under the judge’s recommended route, the existing pipeline would need to be removed and the new one put in its place. Enbridge had asked to leave its current Line 3 in the ground and lay new pipe, at times following a new corridor in the state. The company said in a statement that it was pleased the judge had supported the project and said it would review her recommendations on routing. The latest obstacle to Line 3 comes as work has been halted on Kinder Morgan Canada’s Trans Mountain expansion pending a May 31 decision on whether the project, which faces opposition in the Canadian province of British Columbia, will go ahead. Canada’s oil producers, meanwhile, are desperate for new export pipelines, as rising production and tight capacity on existing pipelines and via rail has led to Canadian crude trading at a wide discount to the West Texas Intermediate benchmark. Shares of Enbridge were down 4.72 percent at C$37.94 on Tuesday morning."
