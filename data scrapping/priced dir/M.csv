28.856922462030365," Macy's to close 45 stores this year (Reuters) - Department store operator Macy’s Inc said on Tuesday it would close about 45 stores this year as part of its three-year plan to lower store count in order to focus on its more productive outlets. Even before the lockdowns in the United States last year, Macy’s had announced the plan to close 125 of its least productive stores to tackle plummeting mall traffic. It had closed about 30 stores in 2020. “Macy’s is committed to rightsizing our store fleet by concentrating our existing retail locations in desirable and well-trafficked A and B malls,” Macy’s said in an emailed statement on Tuesday. The COVID-19 outbreak has worsened the plight of certain mall-based chains, forcing them to shutter stores and double down on their online business, while few chains are looking to open smaller stores in off-mall locations. Macy’s, which operates over 750 shops, including Bluemercury, Bloomingdale’s and its eponymous stores, said it would post a list of stores expected to be closed this year on its website on Wednesday."
40.18433179723503," 'Kind of lonely': America marks COVID-altered Thanksgiving (Reuters) - Americans marked a muted Thanksgiving Day holiday on Thursday, sometimes seeing family only by video after political leaders discouraged travel or large gatherings in the face of the surging coronavirus pandemic. Thanksgiving, typically celebrated with big family dinners, became the latest major event in American life to be altered or diminished by the coronavirus in 2020 as most U.S. states struggle with spiraling infections and deaths. “All of a sudden I feel kind of lonely, I have to admit,” said Janis Segal, 72, as she prepared to join family members in a Zoom call for Thanksgiving. Eight months after the pandemic erupted across the United States most major cities remain under strict rules imposed by state and local officials restricting public gatherings, closing businesses and forbidding indoor dining at restaurants. The U.S. Supreme Court late on Wednesday struck down as unconstitutional an order by New York Governor Andrew Cuomo imposing severe restrictions on the number of people who could worship at churches and synagogues in the state. The court, issuing its first major ruling since the appointment of Justice Amy Coney Barrett by President Donald Trump, found that such rules were a violation of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution when other gatherings were allowed to take place. Cuomo dismissed the court’s ruling as “irrelevant” and suggested that justices were making a political gesture. The traditional Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York, which has marked the holiday for nearly a century, was scaled back significantly. The route was reduced from 2.5 miles to one block and balloon handlers were replaced by specially rigged vehicles. Spectators were forbidden from lining the streets. Confined behind a metal barricade, Brian Campbell, a 55-year old native of Rockaway, New Jersey, called the parade “disappointing.” ‘ITS A LITTLE SAD’ Moriah Hargrave of Lafayette, Louisiana, who got as close as she could to the action near Macy’s flagship store in midtown Manhattan with the hopes of seeing country singer Dolly Parton. “We came to just knock out a few things on our bucket list for New York City,” said Hargrave, 36. “It’s a little sad to be this far away. But it’s fun to be here.” The holiday is being celebrated at a time of severe economic strain for millions of Americans. More than 20 million people are receiving some form of unemployment benefits, and a fresh wave of layoffs is expected as governors impose business restrictions in a bid to tamp down spiraling infections. Asia Foreman, who co-founded a nonprofit with her sister to raise awareness about mental health issues, was working on Thursday afternoon to finish delivering 500 plates of chicken, macaroni and cheese, yams and greens in Washington, D.C. “We wanted to feed as many people as possible so turkey wasn’t in the budget,” she said. “A lot of people haven’t been able to find new jobs to provide for their families because of COVID. It’s not their fault.” U.S. hospitalizations for COVID-19 reached a record of more than 89,000 on Wednesday, and experts warned that holiday gatherings could lead to another spike in cases and deaths. Despite advice from the Centers for Disease Control to stay home, nearly 6 million Americans traveled by air from Friday to Wednesday, according to the U.S. Transportation Security Administration. That number is less than half of the same period last year. Many Americans have not seen their loved ones for months and see the annual get-together as important enough to outweigh the possible risks. Margaret Bullard, a public defender in Atlanta, said she and her husband have taken every precaution since the onset of the pandemic, which came soon after the birth of her 9-month-old son. They drove from their home in Marietta, Georgia, to North Carolina to spend Thanksgiving with her in-laws, who have been equally fastidious in limiting potential exposure to COVID-19. “As much as we would like to see some other family members, we know that we would be taking a much bigger risk by doing so,” said Bullard, who is co-administrator of a Facebook group for “Covid-conscious” Georgians."
40.18433179723503," America celebrates scaled-back Thanksgiving as COVID-19 surges Nov 26 (Reuters) - Americans awoke on Thursday to celebrate a Thanksgiving Day transformed by the coronavirus pandemic, with the Macy’s parade limited to a television-only event and many families resigned to meeting on video for turkey dinner. Thanksgiving, normally a day for family and friends to gather in big numbers to feast and remember life’s blessings, has been upended by the pandemic, with cases and deaths surging in recent weeks as cooler temperatures push people indoors where the virus spreads more easily. The Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York, a spectacle of giant character balloons that has delighted children for nearly a century, has been scaled back significantly. The route is a block long, rather than 2.5 miles; balloon handlers have been replaced by specially rigged vehicles; and spectators will not be allowed to line the streets as before. “And that’s so that we can keep everybody at home safe,” said Susan Tercero, executive producer of the parade, which NBC will air on Thursday from 9 a.m.-noon in all U.S. time zones. “This year, more than ever, it’s really important that we still have something for everybody to tune into on Thanksgiving morning.” U.S. hospitalizations for COVID-19 reached a record 88,000 on Wednesday, and experts warn that Thanksgiving could significantly boost a death toll that has exceeded 260,000 nationwide. Despite advice from the Centers for Disease Control to stay home for the holiday, nearly 5 million Americans traveled by air from Friday to Tuesday, according to the U.S. Transportation Security Administration, although that is less than half the figure during the same period last year. Many Americans see the annual ritual get-together for turkey, mashed potatoes and pumpkin pie as important enough to risk possible infection. Nearly 40% plan to attend a “risky gathering” during the holiday season, either in excess of 10 people or with people from outside their household, and a third will not require masks, according to a national survey by Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center. Many others have cancelled travel plans and will instead connect with loved ones over FaceTime or Zoom. On Wedneday Rhode Island Governor Gina Raimondo implored her constituents to make Thanksgiving gatherings as small as possible, arguing it would save lives. With hospitalizations surging, the state will begin a two-week “pause” on Monday, with bars, fitness gyms and other establishments shut down. “If you had that tough phone call with Mom and Dad and said ‘I’m not coming over for Thanksgiving this year,’ ... thank you,” she told a news conference. “If you haven’t done that it’s not too late.” (Reporting by Angela Moore in New York and Nathan Layne in Wilton, Connecticut; Editing by Richard Chang)"
46.781940441882796," Suspect at large after multiple people wounded in Wisconsin mall shooting (This Nov. 20 story corrects name of shopping mall to ‘Mayfair’ in second paragraph) (Reuters) - A suspect was at large after multiple people were wounded in an “active shooter incident” at a suburban shopping mall in Milwaukee, Wisconsin on Friday. The shooting took place outside a Macy’s department store at the Mayfair Mall in Wauwatosa, a Milwaukee suburb of 47,000 people, according to local authorities. Seven adults and one teenager were transported to the hospital, Wauwatosa Chief of Police Barry Weber said in a statement, but the extent of their injuries was unknown. The shooter left the scene by the time emergency responders arrived, Weber said, and remained at large. Police described him as a white male in his twenties or thirties. Wauwatosa Mayor Dennis McBride said in a statement earlier Friday none of the injuries appeared life-threatening. He added that 75 police officers were on the scene. Live TV shots on local ABC affiliate WISN12 showed dozens of police vehicles with flashing lights outside Macy’s and video posted to Twitter showed paramedics wheeling people out of the mall on stretchers. Several customers interviewed by local media said shoppers and mall employees were locked inside the mall but were safe. One said her sister - a mall employee - heard about 15 shots."
63.07189542483661," Resurgent virus cases cast shadow over Macy's holiday outlook (Reuters) - Macy's Inc M.N reported a more than 20% drop in quarterly comparable sales on Thursday and said it expects declines of that magnitude to continue in the fall, signaling a tough holiday season for the coronavirus-battered department store chain. Macy’s Chief Executive Officer Jeff Gennette said in a statement the company was keeping an eye on a new wave of COVID-19 cases across the United States and the potential impact on its business. The country has been regularly recording over 100,000 daily COVID-19 infections over the last two weeks, raising fears that the spiking numbers will keep people away from already sales-distressed retail stores heading into the holidays. Macy’s said it expects comparable sales of owned and licensed stores to fall by a low- to mid-20s percentage in the fall season. It also said holiday surcharges will lead to higher delivery expenses that will weigh on the fourth quarter. Increased investments in its fulfillment offerings, such as curbside store pickup and same-day delivery, executives said, would help Macy’s during the holiday season, which accounts for a huge chunk - roughly 20% - of annual sales for retailers. “Looking to Holiday 2020, we know this year is different,” CEO Gennette said. “We have the right gifting assortment with newness from value to luxury, and our expanded fulfillment options allow customers to shop safely and conveniently, in store or online.” To attract new customers and retain existing ones, Macy’s said it added new, exclusive products as consumers shift what they spend on and how they spend it, in particular online. Categories including loungewear, home decor, fine jewelry, and fragrances have been performing well, Macy’s said. Gennette said he was optimistic about COVID-19 vaccines, and expects demand for occasion-based apparel, such as formal gowns and prom dresses, “to surge” when people get back to their normal lives. “We’ve gotten our inventories down in those dressier categories, but we will ramp that up very quickly with all of our partners and our private brands as the vaccination becomes more apparent,” he said on a call with analysts. Craig Johnson of Customer Growth Partners said Macy’s sales drop lagged the department store sector but noted that the company is beginning to see the light of day with store traffic pickup in late October through November as the holidays approach. The retailer’s shares were up marginally at $9.02 in morning trading. Its stock has lost nearly half its value in a tumultuous year in which it has had to lay off thousands of workers and suffer through plunging sales due to outlet closures and, distressingly, no international tourism. Big box retailers like Walmart and Target TGT.N, on the other hand, have seen sales soar during the pandemic, clocking record high online sales as Americans opt to make fewer trips and load up on daily essential items like toilet paper and cleaning wipes. Macy’s net sales fell in the third quarter ended Oct. 31 to $3.99 billion from $5.17 billion a year earlier but beat analysts’ estimates of $3.86 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The company posted an adjusted net loss of $60 million, or 19 cents per share, compared with earnings of $21 million, or 7 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected a loss of 79 cents per share."

115.3184165232358," Macy's invests in online 'buy now, pay later' firm Klarna STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Macy’s, the largest U.S. department store operator, has signed a deal to invest in Swedish payments group Klarna, joining investors including rapper Snoop Dogg and BlackRock in betting on the “buy now, pay later” online payments market. The deal includes a five-year partnership between the two companies under which Macy’s customers could choose to make payments in four equal, interest-free installments at the online checkout. Macy’s would be one of the first department store companies to offer Klarna’s “buy now, pay later” (BNPL) service. Klarna has a similar tie-up already with H&M, the world’s second-biggest fashion retailer. “We are in discussions with some global retailers on exclusive deals,” Klarna Chief Executive Officer Sebastian Siemiatkowski told Reuters. “We at Klarna take a very long-term approach and this investment demonstrates a shared commitment and vision to the continual development of retail over the next years to meet customers changing expectations and preferences.” The value of Macy’s investment was not disclosed. Klarna allows shoppers to buy online through its merchant partners and settle the dues in four installments. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a surge in online shopping. “We’re excited to embark on a long-term relationship with Klarna that will help us reach wider audiences looking for seamless alternative payment solutions,” Macy’s Chief Digital Officer Matt Baer said in a statement. The United States is one of the largest markets for BNPL services, with intense competition between the likes of PayPal, Afterpay, Affirm and other fintech companies. Klarna alone recorded 550% growth in the U.S. market in the first half of this year. That helped it raise $650 million last month, valuing the company at $10.65 billion - nearly double the valuation at a funding round in August last year. Klarna’s investors include Silver Lake, Singapore’s sovereign wealth fund GIC, and Sequoia, among others."
43.472222222222214," COVID-19 Masked Snoopy balloon? Macy's Thanksgiving Parade is TV-only event NEW YORK (Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic is transforming this year’s Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade into a television-only spectacle, New York City said on Monday, with the traditional giant character balloons pulled by vehicles rather than humans and absolutely no children allowed. Thousands of wide-eyed onlookers who typically line city streets around the traditional 2.5-mile parade route passing Macy’s Herald Square store instead were advised to cheer the procession from their couches in front of their home television screen. “Under the unique challenges of these unparalleled times, we felt it was important to continue this cherished holiday tradition that has been the opening act to the holiday season for generations of families,” Susan Tercero, the parade’s executive producer, said in a statement. Mayor Bill de Blasio said the city had worked closely with Macy’s to come up with a safe and creative plan to keep the parade - a more than 90-year tradition that typically kicks off the holiday gift buying season - on schedule in the city that was once the U.S. epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic. To pull off a virtual parade for 50 million viewers nationwide, Macy’s announced such drastic changes as a 75 percent reduction in the overall number of clowns, dancers and other procession participants. High school and college marching bands from around the nation that won the honor of being chosen to perform instead will be deferred until the 2021 parade, with only locally based professional marching and musical ensembles in this year’s lineup. “All participants will be appropriately socially distanced during performances and will be required to wear face coverings and additional personal protective equipment depending on their role,” Macy’s said in a statement. “Macy’s signature giant character balloons will be flown without the traditional 80-100 handlers and instead employ an innovative specially rigged anchor vehicle framework of five specialty vehicles,” the statement said. In the year of COVID-19, the spectacle that has been a jaw-dropping delight for children for nearly a century will prohibit participation by anyone under 18 years of age, Macy’s announced. The event airs on NBC on Thursday, Nov. 26, from 9a.m.-noon in all time zones, Macy’s said."

47.56898817345598," Macy's rethinks holidays in the time of COVID-19 with new gifts, online focus (Reuters) - Macy's Inc M.N will drastically change how it does business this holiday season, executives said on Wednesday, placing a sharper focus on online sales and promoting more beauty and home items to shoppers opting to stay home due to the COVID-19 health crisis. Shares of the largest U.S. department store operator rose as much as 11% after it reported a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss and beat sales estimates as shoppers bought more activewear, shoes and handbags on its app and website during the pandemic. They were up about 4% in late morning trading. “Our immediate priority is successfully executing Holiday 2020,” Chief Executive Officer Jeff Gennette said. The holiday season accounts for a huge chunk of annual sales for retailers. This year, retailers are rolling out their earliest-ever holiday deals and promotions. Gennette said nearly half of the company’s total gift assortment will be new, led by items in beauty and home, with products at every price point. Macy’s will also reimagine iconic events including the Thanksgiving Day Parade, local tree lightings and holiday window displays, the company said. Recently announced holiday surcharges will lead to higher delivery expenses that will weigh on the holiday quarter, the company said. To cope with the closure of malls and stores due to coronavirus-related lockdowns, Macy’s has focused on its online business, giving shoppers the option to buy online and pick up purchases from stores. Though Macy’s sold more merchandise online, with digital sales surging 53% for the second quarter ended Aug. 1, it was not enough to make up for lost in-person sales. Macy’s, along with its department store rivals, depends heavily on tourists - particularly those traveling from overseas - to drive sales, especially at stores like its flagship Herald Square location in New York City. “Macy’s second quarter may have exceeded consensus estimates, but the bar was set so low you could step over it,” said Craig Johnson, president at retail consultancy Customer Growth Partners. “The challenge is to size the going-forward company commensurately with demand, trimming the fleet even further, so that store productivity can be rebuilt.” The company said it will open a number of smaller-format Macy’s stores away from malls over the next two years. That comes as the retailer moves to shut hundreds of underperforming stores due to lack of mall traffic. The retailer said it would also test smaller Bloomingdale’s standalone stores. Net sales fell 35.8% to $3.56 billion, but beat analysts’ estimates of $3.48 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. On an adjusted basis, the company lost 81 cents per share, compared with estimates of a loss of $1.77 per share. Net loss for the quarter was $431 million, or $1.39 per share, compared with a profit of $86 million, or 28 cents per share, a year earlier."

The global health crisis has forced brick-and-mortar retailers to tap credit lines, lay off employees and suspend dividends and buybacks in a bid to stay afloat. “While our stores are reopened, we expect that the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact the country for the remainder of the year,” Macy’s chief executive, Jeff Gennette, said in a statement, adding that the department store operator does not expect another total shutdown of stores. Macy’s, which also owns Bloomingdale’s, said net sales for the fiscal first quarter ended May 2 nearly halved to $3.02 billion. The retailer's results come as some of its peers, including J.

On a per-share basis, the company reported a net loss of $11.53 in the first quarter compared with a profit of 44 cents a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, the company lost $2.03 per share, meeting expectations, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

The department store chain, which had about 123,000 employees at the end of January, said it expects to save about $365 million in fiscal 2020 and about $630 million every year as a result of the layoffs. Macy’s had in May warned of nearly $1 billion in operating losses in its first quarter and said it would turn into a “smaller company”. The job cuts come at a time when unemployment figures in the United States are already high. Rising coronavirus infections in many U.S. states including California, Texas and Florida are likely to hurt employment further as some people stay away from consumer-facing establishments. “Expect more layoffs akin to Macy’s to be announced in the coming months,” said Matt Fox, founder of Ithaca Wealth Management in New York. “Retailers that were struggling before the pandemic hit will re-evaluate their operations and cut jobs out of necessity to stay afloat until the economy recovers.” Macy’s said it has also reduced staffing at its stores, supply chains and customer support network and would adjust their levels as sales recover. The company, which reopened its flagship Manhattan store on Monday, said it would bring back most of its remaining furloughed employees in the first week of July.

General Electric chief Larry Culp likes to say he’s “redefining winning.” But investors want to see the company actually winning, and that’s not happening. Culp said on Thursday that the $64 billion GE will, overall, burn cash this year. His goal of getting $59 billion of debt under control is receding. Coronavirus is, of course, the reason. Aircraft makers and hospitals are huge customers, and the pandemic has hobbled both. GE’s aviation business is 70% down, according to Culp, while 85% of aircraft leasing customers have asked for kinder terms. All who can are trying to pay less, or later. Culp says GE is “embracing our reality,” which essentially means laying off staff and hoping for the best. That’s what most other companies are doing too. But unlike many CEOs, he has other options – like selling a stake in GE’s healthcare business. For a boss with so much still to prove, more dramatic action wouldn’t hurt.

It was struggling long before Covid-19. And Fitch Ratings reckons its leverage could climb to a whopping 15 times EBITDA this year. That ratio should fall significantly as people start shopping again, but the company still faces almost $1.5 billion in debt maturities in 2023 and 2024 and perhaps an acceleration of traditional retailers’ decline. The pricey extra debt may, in the end, just weigh it down. (By Anna Szymanski) TECH TAR. Fallout from the coronavirus pandemic has put Twitter and its Chief Executive Jack Dorsey squarely in the crosshairs of U.S. President Donald Trump. Until now, the $25 billion social-media company’s boss had managed to navigate treacherous political waters better than his counterparts at Facebook and Alphabet. Twitter’s fact-checking of a tweet from the commander-in-chief claiming mail-in voting promoted fraud has changed that. Many states are grappling with how to prevent polling booths becoming a Covid-19 health hazard in this year’s elections. Twitter’s move has prompted Trump to resuscitate plans for an executive order, which he may sign as early as today, that could seek to curb liability protections for social-media companies that stifle conservative voices. It’s unclear if the order would have any teeth, and it would almost certainly face court challenges. But it shows that Dorsey’s star in Washington is dimming. (By Jennifer Saba) ON THE MARKET. Salvatore Ferragamo needs a shake-up. The Italian maker of $600 Vara bow pumps recalled former boss Michele Norsa to repair the group after the virus knocked 31.5% off first-quarter sales. He’s a safe pair of hands, having led Ferragamo for 10 years and taken it public in 2011. When he left, the stock was worth almost twice what it’s trading at today. At 71, however, Norsa can’t really be expected to embark on a long restructuring. His arrival suggests the Ferragamos, who tightly control the group, are preparing for deeper change. This could take the form of an outright sale to a bigger rival eager to boost its leather market share: say, Kering or Capri, the parent of Versace and Michael Kors. Private equity could also eye a revamp. At $2 billion euros, Ferragamo is small enough to attract plenty of cash-rich buyers. (By Lisa Jucca) EASY DOES IT. EasyJet is facing up to the harsh new reality for airlines. The UK budget carrier, which is due to restart services on June 15, on Thursday said it expects to fly about 30% of previously planned flights in the crucial months of July, August and September. The 3 billion pound company also said bookings for winter are ahead of last year, as locked-down customers reschedule holidays. Like his rivals at other carriers, Chief Executive Johan Lundgren is being cautious about any recovery. He doesn’t expect demand for flights to return to last year’s level until 2023. That’s why easyJet is scaling back its fleet and cutting as many as 30% of its 15,000 employees. The sombre approach is in contrast to recent investor enthusiasm, spurred by the reopening of European tourist destinations. EasyJet shares are up a third this week. Still, it’s a long haul. (By Peter Thal Larsen) RED LINE. South Korea’s central bank is edging closer to crossing the monetary precipice, cutting the main interest rate on Thursday to a record low of 0.50%. After early success with containing the virus, the country is struggling with smaller outbreaks that threaten plans to ease social distancing curbs. Analysts at Capital Economics expect the $1.6 trillion trade-dependent economy to shrink 3% this year as exports plunge, far more than the official forecast. That adds pressure for the Bank of Korea to follow counterparts from the United States to Indonesia and ramp up asset purchases. It says it is prepared to “actively purchase” treasury bonds if long-term yields become volatile. With little room for more easing, and no sign that domestic or external demand will improve soon, South Korea is fast moving towards monetising its fiscal deficit, and all the problems that go with it. (By Robyn Mak) CROUPIER’S RAKE. Blackstone has found a clever way to play bond market volatility. Last September Spanish gaming group Cirsa, which is controlled by the private equity giant, issued a 400 million euro bond in order to pay a dividend to its owner. Now Blackstone has bought back 120 million euros of those securities at a big discount. The bonds were trading at just 40% of par before Blackstone’s purchases were disclosed. If the move looks cheeky, it’s arguably what private equity groups should be doing: making long-term bets, and spotting value that other investors don’t. If Blackstone cancels the debt, Cirsa and its creditors will be better off. The bigger question is why investors chose to sell at such distressed levels. On Wednesday the bonds were still trading at just 50% of face value, offering a yield of around 26%, according to Refinitiv data. That suggests investors think there is a limit to Blackstone’s charity. (By Neil Unmack)"

Facebook Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg on Thursday said the tech giant will transition toward permanent remote work for many employees, a move that could catch on. Twitter and Square have similar plans. Canadian e-commerce firm Shopify’s Chief Executive Tobi Lutke on Thursday declared an end to “office centricity.” It’s not just an act of kindness. Companies with home-based workforces can cut down on office costs. It also increases their pool of prospective employees, who would no longer have to relocate to high-cost cities like San Francisco or New York. But the idea isn’t appealing to all. Though Facebook employees like the idea of optional remote work, only about 20% would be enthusiastic about having it long-term, the Wall Street Journal reported. That makes sense. Face-to-face contact may help relationship-building and innovation. Besides, when it’s involuntary, working from home may feel for some like living in the office. (By Leigh Anderson) U.S. RETAIL HAS MOUNTAIN TO CLIMB. Department store Macy’s, a shopping-mall staple, unveiled preliminary results for the first quarter with an ugly forecast. Sales are expected to fall 45% and bring an operating loss of some $900 million, and that is the sunny end of the range. What matters more is what Macy’s is seeing now. The retailer has opened around 190 stores and expects another 80 stores to open for the coming Memorial Day weekend. Chief Executive Jeff Gennette said digital sales picked up in April and two weeks of reopened stores had seen customer demand moderately stronger than expected. Still, Macy’s is seeking additional financial flexibility. It’s a tough road ahead for a part of the retail market that was already struggling. Peers J. Crew, J.C. Penney and Neiman Marcus have already headed to bankruptcy court. (By Jennifer Saba) PER ARDUA AD ASTRA. AstraZeneca is in danger of getting bogged down in the “vaccine nationalism” controversy that tripped up French peer Sanofi. The $145 billion UK pharma group is leading the manufacturing and distribution of a Covid-19 vaccine developed by Oxford University scientists, and said on Thursday it has already agreed to supply 400 million doses. The snag: They are going straight to rich countries who are investing in the programme. The U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority on May 21 announced a $1.2 billion investment, and has bought 300 million doses. The UK, which has invested 65 million pounds, is expecting 100 million. Critics may wonder how that squares with the group’s claim to distribute the drug in an “equitable manner”. Still, AstraZeneca Chief Executive Pascal Soriot can hardly be accused of callous profiteering: He is selling the drug at cost. Moreover, AstraZeneca has already lined up capacity for 1 billion doses, and is working on more. Arguably, there’s a bigger issue: Recent trials on rhesus monkeys suggested the drug may not actually stop infections. At least Soriot and his backers are giving it a go. (By Neil Unmack) PATRIOTIC DEBT. Italy has turned to small investors to help fund its ballooning Covid-19 budget. This week’s sale of a BTP Italia bond raised 22.3 billion euros, some two-thirds from domestic savers. That’s a record since Rome in the euro zone crisis introduced this form of patriotic debt, which is vaguely reminiscent of Liberty Bonds used to finance U.S. participation in World War One. And it partly reverses a deluge of foreign sales that followed a March lockdown. Rallying local investors around the flag might help allay concerns about Italy’s debt rising to 170% of gross domestic product because of the pandemic. Japan’s debt, which is proportionally higher but considered safer, is chiefly in domestic hands. Italian savers used to be big fans of high-yielding BTPs and their shorter-dated equivalents before the euro, but they lost interest once interest rates fell. They now hold barely 5% of Italy’s 2 trillion euros of bonds – so even though the new sale is a success, it’s also just a drop in Italy’s debt ocean. (By Lisa Jucca) BRICK AND DIGITS. With Chinese shoppers quarantined and forced to buy toilet paper online in bulk, Walmart’s subscription-based chain Sam’s Club enjoyed double-digit growth in Chinese sales in the first quarter, while Walmart’s overall e-commerce operations in the country expanded 160%. The company now wants to expand its existing 26-store footprint to 100. Even amid the revived tensions between Washington and Beijing, Walmart is building in the People’s Republic, which grew faster in terms of net sales and average ticket size than any other market, including the United States. After years of rocky performance, the U.S. discount retail giant has finally found traction with Chinese consumers. Its rival Costco’s launch frenzy in Shanghai last August suggests there is rising demand for American-style box stores, supplemented by online shopping options. Walmart’s partnership with domestic e-commerce giant JD.com is going well enough too. Even as some U.S. firms relocate supply chains out of China, Walmart is digging in. (By Jamie Lo) INSURANCE RESILIENCE. Boring can be beautiful. Generali’s habit of hoarding capital and its focus on private customers and small businesses is offering some protection in the pandemic. Italy’s biggest insurer beat analysts’ forecasts with a 7.6% increase in first-quarter operating profit, to 1.45 billion euros. At 196%, its solvency ratio – the ability to meet obligations towards policyholders – is stronger than at rivals Allianz, AXA and Aviva. And while big impairments on financial holdings hurt its bottom line, that is likely to be partially reversed in the next quarter. Unlike peers, Generali doesn’t provide insurance for event cancellations or for the pandemic. Britain’s Aviva, by comparison, flagged 160 million pounds of Covid-19-related claims. Even so, the near absence of travel and Italy’s cratering economy will inevitably erode Generali’s revenue and profit this year. A decision to pay a staggered dividend despite the crisis is gutsy.

Hotels and restaurants group Whitbread, whose shares have more than halved this year, is seeking to raise 1 billion pounds in a rights issue: more than a quarter of its market capitalisation. Chief Executive Alison Brittain says the rights issue will allow her to continue investing in Germany and the United Kingdom to take advantage of long-term growth opportunities. This may be optimistic. The operator of Beefeater restaurants and Premier Inn hotels began the crisis with a strong balance sheet: net debt was 0.6 times adjusted EBITDA. But it’s been hit hard by the lockdown. With restaurants and most hotels shut, Whitbread has furloughed more than 27,000 of its employees. It also has chunky fixed costs: A 1% fall in the revenue per available hotel room translates into an 18 million pound hit to earnings. The scale of its cash call points to a sharp downturn and slow recovery. (By Dasha Afanasieva)"
16.573556797020476," Macy's to be 'smaller company' as loss to hit $1 billion in quarter amid lockdowns (Reuters) - Macy's Inc M.N said on Thursday it could rack up operating losses of up to $1.11 billion in the first quarter, as the department store operator was forced to shut stores due to lockdowns aimed at curbing the spread of the new coronavirus. “We anticipate that our sales recovery will be gradual and that for a period of time, we will be a smaller company,” Chief Executive Jeff Gennette said on a call with investors. Shares were up nearly 3% at $5.22 in morning trading. The global health crisis has forced brick-and-mortar retailers to tap credit lines, lay off employees and suspend dividends and buybacks in a bid to stay afloat amid store closures. Just this month, several retailers, including J Crew, J.C. Penney and Neiman Marcus Group, filed for bankruptcy after failing to cope with market uncertainties and mounting debt. Macy's, which shut all of its 775 stores on March 18, hired investment bank Lazard Ltd LAZ.N to explore options for bolstering its finances, Reuters reported last month. While online sales have helped, they weren’t enough to offset losses relating to store closures, and from suits to dresses, apparel sales have been “soft,” Gennette said. However, fine jewelry, kids and home were categories that performed better than others during the pandemic, he said. Macy’s will continue to monitor consumer behavior and expand its packaged food offerings and more, he said. The largest U.S. department store operator by sales, Macy’s expects an operating loss of between $905 million and $1.11 billion in the first quarter, and sales of $3 billion to $3.03 billion, down from $5.50 billion a year earlier. The loss excludes estimated pretax non-cash goodwill and asset impairment charges for the quarter. The 161-year-old retailer started reopening stores on a state-by-state basis on May 4. As of this week, about 190 stores of Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s, a chain that belongs to Macy’s, had reopened. Macy’s expects most stores to reopen by late June, including its flagship Herald Square store, which stretches over an entire block in the heart of Manhattan in New York City. The company expects to report more details on its preliminary first-quarter performance on June 9 and release its earnings for the period on July 1."

6.143344709897601," Macy's reopening 68 stores, targets all within six weeks as U.S. curbs loosen NEW YORK (Reuters) - Macy’s Inc plans to reopen 68 U.S. stores on Monday in states that have loosened coronavirus lockdowns, the department store operator said on Thursday, as more retailers sought to get business going after a crushing month of closures. Cincinnati, Ohio-based Macy’s, the largest U.S. department store operator by sales, said it expects to have all of its roughly 775 stores reopened in six weeks, if infection rates taper off as projected and state and local governments allow it. The next batch of roughly 50 stores is scheduled to reopen on May 11, it said. At this time, the company is not naming which store locations will reopen, a spokeswoman said. All of its stores have been closed since March 18. However, the shopping experience will be greatly changed, as many shoppers remain wary about the virus. For instance, the number of fitting rooms offered to shoppers at one time will be reduced and sanitized frequently. Plexiglas will be at each cash register, signs will alert shoppers to keep 6 feet apart, beauty consultations will be “no-touch” only, and more. The reopened stores will operate on reduced hours from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Shares of Macy’s, which also owns the Bloomingdale’s and Bluemercury chains, were down roughly 6.5% in afternoon trading. Earlier this month, Reuters reported that Macy’s hired investment bank Lazard Ltd to explore options for bolstering its finances after the department store operator lost most of its revenue because of its decision to shut down all its stores amid the outbreak, people familiar with the matter said. The reopening plan, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, follows moves by other major retailers judged “non-essential” in the crisis to get business at their physical stores going again, albeit slowly and with restrictions in place. Simon Property Group Inc, America’s biggest mall operator, expects to open 49 properties starting Friday based on current state and/or local stay-at-home or closure orders. The majority of reopenings are expected in the South, where restrictions have loosened up the most thus far in the United States. Coach handbag maker Tapestry Inc also said on Thursday it would start reopening some stores in North America, as it tries to recover from the damage to its sales caused by the lockdowns. “Keeping stores closed isn’t helping the retailers or malls. ... They don’t have cash to last too much longer,” Sucharita Kodali, retail analyst at Forrester Research, said of retailers starting to reopen stores for business. “Opening them may help to salvage some sales especially so long as they can generate more revenue than their labor costs.” The most cash-constrained will likely reopen soon, Kodali added, while others “may have the luxury to hold out longer.”"

34.02489626556016," Macy’s taps Bank of America for US$5bn in debt to support operations NEW YORK, April 22 (LPC) - Department store chain Macy’s is looking to raise up to US$5bn in debt financing, two sources familiar with the discussions told Refinitiv LPC on Wednesday. Bank of America is leading the transaction. The financing package could comprise cash flow and asset-based components including debt secured by real estate assets, the two sources said. CNBC first reported the debt financing on Tuesday. The new financing may also encompass a refinancing of Macy’s existing debt, one of the sources said. The move comes as retailers have been forced to shutter their stores on government orders as consumers remain indoors and avoid large public gatherings to limit the spread of the coronavirus. All of Macy’s stores, including the Bloomingdales, and Bluemercury brands, have been closed since March 18, according to a company press release. Though the retailer has lost the majority of its sales due to the closures, it said the stores will remain shuttered until it is safe to reopen. Measures the company has taken to maintain financial flexibility include suspending its dividend, drawing down on its US$1.5bn revolving credit, freezing both hiring and spending, and putting the majority of its employees on furlough. The company said it is evaluating financing options, the release states. Macy’s hired financial advisory firm Lazard and law firm Kirkland & Ellis earlier this month to explore options that could include new financing, Reuters reported on April 11. Last month the company announced plans to draw down the entire US$1.5bn from its revolving credit facility to preserve financial flexibility in light of the coronavirus spread.

6.655844155844158," Exclusive: Macy's taps Lazard to bolster finances as coronavirus saps sales - sources NEW YORK (Reuters) - Macy's Inc M.N has hired investment bank Lazard Ltd LAZ.N to explore options for bolstering its finances after the department store operator lost most of its revenue as it shut down all its stores as a result of the coronavirus outbreak, people familiar with the matter said. The move by Macy’s, the largest U.S. department store operator by sales, is a sign of the severity of the crisis facing brick-and-mortar retailers, which were already struggling with the shift to online shopping. The pandemic has forced store closures and widespread furloughs of employees as state after state issued shelter-in-place orders in efforts to contain the spread of the coronavirus, which causes the COVID-19 respiratory illness. Macy’s has called in Lazard bankers who specialize in finding ways to recapitalize financially troubled companies and rework debts, the sources said. Macy’s has also enlisted debt restructuring lawyers at Kirkland & Ellis LLP, two of the sources said. Macy’s has asked its advisers to help manage its liabilities and explore options that could include new financing, the sources said, adding that no debt restructuring is imminent. The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. A spokeswoman for Macy’s said in a statement that the company is “exploring numerous options to strengthen our capital structure,” adding that it maintains relationships with a range of advisers. The company, which operates the Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s department stores, declined to comment further beyond pointing to previous steps it has taken in response to the pandemic, which include suspending its quarterly dividend, drawing down its credit line, deferring spending, reducing pay at most management levels and furloughing the majority of its roughly 123,000 employees. A Kirkland spokeswoman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A Lazard spokeswoman declined to comment. The company, which also operates the bluemercury beauty products and spa chain, has $3.6 billion in long-term debt and roughly $7 billion in store lease obligations. It had $685 million in cash as of the end of its most recent fiscal year, and recently drew down another $1.5 billion from a credit line while its stores remained closed. Macy's decision to explore new financing, among other options, makes it the latest U.S. retailer to do so. On Thursday, rival Nordstrom Inc JWN.N raised $600 million by placing real estate assets that included five stores, six distribution centers and its Seattle headquarters in a separate company and borrowing against it by issuing bonds. Macy’s was already in the midst of slashing costs before the coronavirus outbreak, with plans to permanently close 125 stores over the next three years and cut more than 2,000 jobs. Those were in addition to the more than 100 store closures and thousands of job cuts it has rolled out since 2015. The 161-year-old department store operator closed all of its 775 department stores last month in response to the pandemic. That made its e-commerce operations its only source of revenue; e-commerce accounted for about 25% of its roughly $25 billion in sales in the 12 months ending Feb. 1. It is unclear when Macy’s and other department store chains will be able to re-open their stores. Credit ratings firm Fitch Ratings Inc said earlier this month that it expected Macy’s revenue to plunge nearly 25% this year. The New York-based company’s shares have tumbled more than 60% since the start of this year, giving the retailer a market capitalization of roughly $2 billion. Like many companies hit hard by the pandemic, Macy’s has said its chief executive, Jeff Gennette, will forego pay during the crisis. Last week, Macy’s announced that its chief financial officer had decided to step down at the end of May and that it was seeking a replacement. Macy’s became a U.S. household name over the decades, known for its Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York City and its flagship Herald Square store, which stretches over an entire block in the heart of Manhattan. Macy’s has $530 million of debt due in January 2021 and another $450 million at the start of 2022, and likely has enough cash to make those payments, Fitch said. The company’s credit rating was downgraded to junk by two ratings firms in recent weeks, making it more expensive for the retailer to borrow. However, Macy’s junk-rated bonds rallied last week after the Federal Reserve said it would expand its asset-buying program to bonds of companies that had been investment-grade but then were downgraded to junk status.

28.11918063314711," Macy's, Kohl's, Gap turn to mass furloughs as virus crisis deepens (Reuters) - Major U.S. retailers Macy's Inc M.N, Kohl's Corp KSS.N and Gap Inc GPS.N said on Monday they would furlough tens of thousands of employees, as they prepare to keep stores shut for longer to curb the spread of the coronavirus outbreak. Kohl’s also said it would suspend its share repurchase program, evaluate its dividend plan and draw down $1 billion from an existing credit line, joining a growing list of companies seeking to shore up their cash reserves to weather the financial hit from the health crisis. Macy’s and Gap have suspended their dividends and have also tapped into their credit facilities. Gap said the furloughs will affect its store employees in the United States and Canada. The company had about 129,000 employees at the end of last year. The action will impact a majority of its about 130,000 employees, Macy’s said, while all workers at store and store distribution centers, as well as some corporate office associates will be affected, according to Kohl’s. Shares of Kohl’s, which had about 122,000 employees in 2019, closed down nearly 9%. Macy’s stock ended nearly 3% lower. “Given these extraordinary circumstances, we are taking difficult and decisive actions to strengthen our financial liquidity,” Kohl’s Chief Executive Officer Michelle Gass said in a statement. Gass said she will not take a salary. Widespread lockdowns to arrest the spread of the outbreak in the United States have hammered sales for brick-and-mortar retailers as most stores remain closed, despite their online business staying up and running. President Donald Trump on Sunday extended his stay-at-home guidelines until the end of April, dropping a hotly criticized plan to get the economy up and running by mid-April after a top medical adviser said more than 100,000 Americans could die from the outbreak. The pandemic, which has killed about 34,000 people across the globe, has compounded sales pressure for retailers already facing stiff competition and a shift to online shopping. Kohl’s said furloughed employees would continue to get health benefits. Macy’s specified that employees enrolled in health benefits will continue to receive coverage, at least through May.

-55.9866125114153," Macy's holiday quarter beats Street, investors skeptical on strategy (Reuters) - Macy's Inc M.N holiday-quarter results beat analyst expectations on Tuesday, but investor skepticism around its cost-cutting strategy at a time of intense online competition sent shares down nearly 5%. Earlier this month, Macy’s said it would close 125 stores, including those based in “lower tier” shopping malls, and explore new off-mall formats in order to trim costs and boost growth. The Cincinnati, Ohio-based retailer, along with other department store chains, has grappled with retaining existing shoppers and attracting new ones as consumers increasingly turn to online giants like Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O and discount retailers like TJX Cos Inc's TJX.N Marshalls and T.J. Maxx chains. “The challenge with Macy’s is that it is in the struggling department store sector and many of its locations just aren’t good,” Sucharita Kodali, retail analyst at Forrester Research, said. “But hopefully with more drop-shipping in digital, more stores-in-stores, more private label, better supply chain - that may collectively help to reverse their revenue decline,” she said. Shares of the company were down 4.5% at $14.75 in afternoon trading. To prop up profits and foot traffic, the 161-year-old retailer has also invested heavily in its off-price “Backstage” business and experimented with resale and rental offerings. Some analysts were not optimistic about the cost-cutting efforts. Retail research firm GlobalData Retail’s managing director Neil Saunders said there would be disruptions and higher expenses, and questions remained over how initiatives such as store closures and new formats would bring in gains. There could be other headwinds as well, officials said. Macy’s has seen slower sales at tourist-based stores due to the coronavirus outbreak that began in China, and anticipates a small impact on first-quarter sales from a dent in international tourism, executives told investors on a conference call. The company, which operates roughly 70 stores with a strong Asian customer base, is working with vendor partners to minimize disruption, the executives said. Fine jewelry, dresses and fragrances performed well during the reported quarter, the retailer said, while demand for fashion watches and small household items was weak. Macy’s reported a small decline in holiday same-store sales in January, surprising investors who were bracing for a sharper drop after a profit warning citing weak international tourism and sluggish mall traffic. “We had a solid holiday season,” though the entire year did not play out as intended, Chief Executive Officer Jeff Gennette said on a post-earnings conference call. Excluding one-time items, the company earned $2.12 per share, beating the average estimate of $1.96. Net sales fell 1.4% to $8.34 billion, but were a touch above analysts’ estimate of $8.32 billion. Comparable sales at Macy’s owned and licensed stores fell 0.5% in the fourth quarter ended Feb. 1, compared with the 0.93% fall estimated by analysts, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Net income attributable to the company fell to $340 million, or $1.09 per share, from $740 million, or $2.37 per share, a year earlier. The company reaffirmed its full-year forecast on Tuesday."

-66.67504743905012," Macy's to close 125 stores, cut more than 2,000 jobs (Reuters) - Macy's Inc M.N said on Tuesday it plans to close 125 of its least productive stores over the next three years to tackle slowing mall traffic and will slash more than 2,000 corporate jobs as a part of a cost-savings effort. The Cincinnati, Ohio-based company operated 867 stores according to a regulatory filing a year ago. It had 130,000 total employees at the time. Macy’s said it would close stores in “lower tier” malls, and explore new off-mall formats, as it looks to tackle plummeting mall traffic in the United States. The 161-year-old department store chain has been grappling with retaining existing shoppers and attracting new ones as consumers opt for online shopping. Since 2015, it has closed more than 100 stores and cut thousands of jobs. “We will focus our resources on the healthy parts of our business, directly address the unhealthy parts of the business and explore new revenue streams,” Chief Executive Officer Jeff Gennette said in a statement. The 125 stores targeted for closure currently account for about $1.4 billion in annual sales, the company said. Annual revenue was $24.97 billion in fiscal 2019. The largest U.S. department store operator also said it expects annual gross cost savings of $1.5 billion by 2022, with $600 million expected in 2020. It forecast full-year net sales of between $23.6 billion and $23.9 billion, below analysts’ average estimate of $24.36 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. “We think the pace of closures across three years is modest compared to years past,” said CFRA analyst Camilla Yanushevsky.

-65.4181347416496," Macy's holiday season sales fall less than feared, to close 29 stores (Reuters) - Macy's Inc M.N reported a small decline in holiday same-store sales on Wednesday, surprising investors who were bracing for a sharper drop following an earlier profit warning. The company, which cut its annual profit forecast in November blaming weak international tourism and sluggish mall traffic, reported a 0.6% decline in holiday sales during November and December. Macy’s is among the first major corporate names to report sales for the holiday season, which is seen as a barometer for the health of U.S. consumer spending. The retailer also plans to shutter 28 Macy’s locations and one Bloomingdale’s store in the coming weeks, a Macy’s spokeswoman said. She said the closures were part of a routine review of the company’s store portfolio. Macy’s operates about 860 stores in the United States. For the full quarter, analysts were expecting a 1.8% decline in same-store sales, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. “It’s bit of a relief for investors, as they were concerned sales were going to be down more than that,” Ken Perkins, founder of research firm Retail Metrics told Reuters. Given the traffic at stores did not look particularly great during the holidays, the sales number looks good, Perkins said. He cautioned, however, that heavy discounting during the season could dent the company’s margins. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Gennette said Macy’s holiday sales benefited from online purchases and demand for gift products, as well as a complete revamp of about 150 stores with fresh interiors and better merchandise. U.S. consumers are increasingly spending more money online rather than queuing up at physical stores during the holiday season, forcing traditional brick-and-mortar retailers to invest in more shopping and delivery options. U.S. e-commerce sales in the period from Nov. 1 through Christmas Eve rose 18.8%, according to a Dec. 25 report by Mastercard Inc MA.N, while overall holiday retail sales, excluding autos, rose just 3.4%. Consumer spending in the country is benefiting from wage growth and the lowest unemployment rate in nearly half a century.

13.363333609766537," Macy's cuts profit outlook as tourist numbers drop (Reuters) - Macy's Inc M.N cut its annual profit forecast for the second time this year on Thursday, as the department store operator blamed weak international tourism, warm weather and sluggish mall traffic for the first drop in same-store sales in two years. Shares fell nearly 2% in afternoon trading. The company was the second major U.S. department store, after Kohl's Corp KSS.N, to cut its earnings outlook ahead of the critical holiday sales season. “The sales deceleration was steeper than we expected,” Chief Executive Jeff Gennette said in a statement. But he told investors Macy’s was positioned for a strong holiday season, citing an expanded assortment of gifts, improved customer service and more flexible pickup or delivery options. Department stores and apparel retailers are struggling to lure shoppers to malls and away from big-box budget retailers like Target Corp TGT.N and Walmart Inc WMT.N, or online sellers like Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O. Target on Wednesday posted another set of strong sales numbers and raised its full-year forecast. Comparable sales at Macy’s owned and licensed stores fell 3.5% in the third quarter ended Nov. 2, as warm weather hurt demand for coats and sweaters. Analysts had expected a 1% decrease, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. A drop in international tourists, some of Macy’s biggest spenders, also hit sales, the 161-year-old, Cincinnati-based retailer, said. Tourist arrivals to the United States have taken a hit in the past year, hurt by a stronger dollar, weaker pound, and escalating trade tensions between Washington and Beijing, denting the number of international visitors to the country. Tourism was down 6.3% in the quarter, following on from a 4% fall the previous year, Macy’s said. The company also said it had experienced some issues with its website “in preparation for the fourth quarter.” Some analysts are skeptical about Macy’s and other department stores’ prospects for the holiday season, a period that can be make-or-break for retailers. Thanksgiving, the traditional kickoff of the U.S. holiday shopping period, falls on Nov. 28 this year, a week later than last year’s Nov. 22, leaving retailers with six fewer days to make sales between Thanksgiving and Christmas Day. “We expect a very competitive and difficult holiday quarter for the department store segment,” said research firm Retail Metrics founder Ken Perkins, citing expected steep promotions and discounts. Many of the top gift ideas are electronics including TVs and laptops, which Macy’s does not sell, Perkins added. Macy’s does sell some smaller electronics, such as smart watches, Bluetooth speakers, and headphones, however. The largest U.S. department store operator is also hoping a recent revamp will lure in holiday shoppers. It has closed more than 100 stores since 2015 and cut thousands of jobs as mall traffic plummeted, but has completed a revamp of about 150 stores with refreshed interiors. It has also expanded discounted “Backstage” departments into more stores. It has also upgraded its website and worked to clear excess inventory, said Gennette. Mattresses, fragrances, dresses, and fine jewelry performed well during the reported quarter, the retailer said, while men’s and women’s sportswear, handbags, housewares, and furniture performed poorly. Macy’s now expects 2019 adjusted profit of between $2.57 per share and $2.77 per share, compared with its previous forecast of between $2.85 and $3.05. It also projected full-year total comparable sales to fall between 1% and 1.5%, compared with a previous forecast of up to a 1% rise. Adjusted net income attributable to Macy’s shareholders fell to $21 million, or 7 cents per share, in the quarter, from $83 million, or 27 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected the company to break-even on a per share basis. Rival Nordstrom Inc JWN.N is set to report quarterly results later on Thursday."

0.8300716956169786," Macy's sees savings of up to $550 million from targeted promotions, better pricing (Reuters) - Macy's Inc M.N said on Thursday it aimed to save $400 million to $550 million annually in the next two to four years, as the department store chain cuts back on discounts, sending its shares up 5% in mid-day trading. The 160-year-old company, which has been spending heavily on remodeling its stores and building off-price and online businesses, has relied on discounting to clear inventory, a move that has hurt its earnings. Speaking at a retail conference hosted by Goldman Sachs, Chief Financial Officer Paula Price said some of the savings will be supported by better prices as the retailer moves towards targeted promotions for customers. “We know that some of our customers respond particularly well to coupons while others do not. And so using data and customer analytics, we can become more precise on who we target with promotions and what offers we provide,” Price said. Macy’s, the largest U.S. department store chain, has closed more than 100 stores and cut thousands of jobs as mall traffic falls amid a shift in customer preference to shop online. The company said it is also testing self checkout in stores and rolling out new modernized handheld devices for staff to improve efficiency. The retailer also said it expects to drive about $100 million in additional working capital improvements. Earlier this year, Macy’s said it would cut 100 senior management positions to reduce costs and improve profitability."

-1.2407956620922345," Macy's shares sink as discounts to clear inventory hurt, tourism drops (Reuters) - Macy's Inc M.N cut its full-year earnings forecast on Wednesday after missing estimates for quarterly profit for the first time in at least two years, as it discounted merchandise heavily to clear spring inventory, sending its shares down as much as 18%. The largest U.S. department store operator, whose flagship building in Manhattan is a major tourist attraction, blamed a bigger-than-expected decline in tourist spending for the shortfall along with weak demand for its own-brand women’s sportswear and for warm weather apparel. “We had a slow start to the quarter and finished below our expectations,” Chief Executive Jeff Gennette said in a statement. Tourist arrivals to the United States have taken a hit in the past year, hurt by a stronger dollar and escalating trade tensions between Washington and Beijing, denting the number of Chinese visitors to the country. The number of Chinese citizens arriving in the United States dipped 2.8% in the first six months of the year, according to the National Travel and Tourism Office. Like its peers, the Cincinnati, Ohio-based retailer, which has closed more than 100 stores since 2015 and cut thousands of jobs as mall traffic plummeted, faltered in the past few years as it struggled to adjust to a fiercely competitive retail landscape where shoppers buy more goods online at places like Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O. “While they are controlling what they can control, the headwinds from both macro and micro factors continue to grow, creating a challenging backdrop for CEO Jeff Gennette to manage through,” said Gordon Haskett analyst Chuck Grom. “The good news is that they have a plan.” The 160-year-old company is pumping money into projects such as remodeling its stores and building up its off-price and online businesses. Macy’s also announced a partnership with fashion resale marketplace thredUP, aimed at helping the chain “reach a new customer and keep them coming back to shop...,” the company said. Retailers like Macy’s have been burdened by a long-drawn trade war between the United States and China, which U.S. President Donald Trump escalated earlier this month by threatening to impose 10% tariffs on $300 billion worth of Chinese goods from Sept. 1. On Tuesday, the Trump administration delayed the 10% tariffs on some Chinese goods until Dec. 15. Macy’s executives reassured investors on a post-earnings call Wednesday that the company is in “active discussions” with vendors and suppliers to mitigate tariffs and minimize customer impact in 2019 as much as possible. Analysts said the temporary tariff reprieve would likely not benefit retailers greatly. “Only a small percentage of soft-good tariffs are actually getting delayed until December 15th and none have been removed yet,” UBS analyst Jay Sole wrote in a note, adding that, of the approximately 789 apparel and footwear categories on the original latest list of tariffs, only 17% have had tariffs delayed. Gennette said he believed 10% tariffs to be manageable but that it would be harder to maintain pricing if 25% tariffs are imposed on all remaining imports from China, adding “there’s no customer appetite for price increases.” Macy’s now expects 2019 adjusted profit to be between $2.85 per share to $3.05 per share, down from a previous forecast of $3.05 to $3.25. The company’s margins in the quarter fell to 38.8% from 40.4% a year earlier, hit hard by steep markdowns. For the second quarter ended Aug. 3, net income attributable to Macy’s shareholders slumped 48% to $86 million, or 28 cents per share. Analysts on average had expected the company to earn 45 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Net sales fell marginally to $5.55 billion, largely in line with estimates, while sales at its established stores rose 0.3%. Still, Macy’s, whose digital business posted its fortieth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth, maintained its 2019 sales expectations, and said it entered the fall season with the “right inventory.” Macy’s shares, which have declined about 35% this year, opened at a near 10-year low. Shares were down about 15% at $16.50 in afternoon trading Wednesday. The company, which is the first of the department stores to report results, also dragged down peers' shares. Kohl's KSS.N, Nordstrom JWN.N and J.C. Penney JCP.N were down between 8% and 11%."

Penney Co Inc and Macy’s Inc have opposed U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposal to include apparel and footwear among the Chinese goods targeted for tariffs. The companies warned that U.S. consumers would have to pay more as they would not be able to quickly shift sourcing from China for items listed in separate letters dated June 17 and posted online to the U.S Trade Representative. The retailer listed 26 items, ranging from women’s pullovers to Christmas ornaments, and stressed that women would be hurt disproportionately by the proposed tariffs. It said that 13 items on their priority list were apparels for women and girls. ""For goodness sakes, a tax on Christmas ornaments? One wouldn't think the Administration would seek to emulate the Grinch, who left little Cindy-Lou Who with walls devoid of ornaments and 'nothing but hooks and some wire,'"" J.C. Penney said in the letter here. Penney’s rival Macy’s, which listed 63 priority items, said the tariffs on all types of baby garments could hurt new parents. ""It is hard enough for new parents to make ends meet while changing diapers and surviving on a few hours of sleep. Is it really a good idea to impose new taxes on baby clothes?"" it said in the letter here. The USTR had on Monday kicked off seven days of testimony from U.S. retailers, manufacturers and other businesses about Trump’s plan to hit another $300 billion worth of Chinese goods with tariffs. The hearings will end on June 25 and the tariffs will not come into effect until after July 2, when a seven-day final rebuttal comment period ends."
-17.577836545944038," Retailers RH, Oxford Industries plan price hike to soften China tariff impact (Reuters) - Home furnishing retailer RH and apparel retailer Oxford Industries Inc revealed major steps, including shifting production out of China and raising prices, to cushion the impact of the tariff hike on Chinese goods. Shares of RH surged about 25%, while those of Oxford Industries rose 9% after both companies reported strong quarterly results. RH said it selectively increased prices of its products while moving certain production and development of new products out of China and expanding manufacturing facilities in the United States to offset the impact of tariffs. “Long term, we do not believe the current trade climate will impair our ability to achieve our stated financial goals,” RH Chief Executive Officer Gary Friedman said in a statement. Tommy Bahama-owner Oxford Industries, which reaffirmed its full-year outlook, said it plans to hike prices selectively, if proposed tariff hike on remaining Chinese imports are introduced. Oxford Industries is also negotiating on price reductions with factories and shifting production out of China, besides accelerating the delivery of its Fall products. Ever since the U.S. imposed tariffs on Chinese imports in the wake of trade dispute between Washington and Beijing last year, retailers have been adopting various strategies to mitigate the impact. Retailers like Walmart Inc and Best Buy Co Inc had warned of higher prices after Washington dramatically escalated the trade war last month with threats of new tariffs on another $300 billion worth of U.S. imports from China after hiking levies on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods. Separately, mattress fabrics maker Culp Inc said on Wednesday the tariffs had caused “significant disruptions” throughout the furniture industry supply chain. Culp also noted that the expectation of additional tariffs led to advance customer purchases in its upholstery segment in previous quarters, resulting in higher inventories that partly hit its sales in the fourth quarter. Culp said it was taking steps to adjust its supply chain, including partnering with sources for cut and sew kits in Vietnam, in response to the latest round of tariffs."
-24.194073113693058," Macy's CEO says tariff escalation could hurt business (Reuters) - Macy’s Inc said on Wednesday the latest tariffs on Chinese imports by Washington are hitting its furniture business and warned investors that additional levies would leave its clothing and accessory categories vulnerable as well. The largest U.S. department store operator is one of the first to comment publicly on the damage that U.S. President Donald Trump imposing tariffs on all remaining imports from China, another $300 billion worth of goods, could have on business. In Macy’s case, the potential tariffs would impact both its private and national brands, Gennette said. Gennette said any escalation of tit-for-tat tariffs was not factored into the company’s annual outlook and that the company would do what it could to minimize the effect on customers. The executive said the company had worked hard to reduce reliance on Chinese suppliers. Washington dramatically escalated its 10-month trade war with Beijing on Friday by raising levies on $200 billion of Chinese goods in the midst of trade talks, and U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened new tariffs on all remaining U.S. imports from China, sending global financial markets into a tailspin. China retaliated on Monday, though on a smaller scale. Macy’s topped Wall Street estimates for quarterly same-store sales and profit benefiting from increased online sales and higher demand for items sold at its off-price stores. Macy’s shares, which have so far lost more than a quarter of their value this year, were down less than 1% at $21.61 in afternoon trading. Like its peers, the Cincinnati, Ohio-based department store chain, which has closed more than 100 stores since 2015 and cut thousands of jobs as mall traffic plummeted, faltered in the past few years as it struggled to adjust to a fiercely competitive retail landscape where shoppers buy more goods online at places like Amazon.com Inc. The 160-year-old retailer has poured money into building up its private label clothing as well as expand its off-price venture, Backstage, by adding 45 more stores this year. Gennette said brick-and-mortar sales trends improved sequentially in the first quarter, helped by its off-price Backstage business. The retailer said it saw double-digit growth in its digital business and that mobile continues to be Macy’s fastest-growing channel for sales growth. Sales at Macy’s stores open more than 12 months, including sales in department stores licensed to third parties, rose for the sixth straight quarter. They were up 0.7%, above the average analyst estimate of a 0.3% rise, according to research firm Consensus Metrix. Gross margin in the quarter fell to 38.2% from 39%, because a delayed start to spring bloated inventories. Macy’s said it expects to see some gross margin pressure in the second quarter as it continues to clear excess spring products. Last quarter, Macy’s announced a plan focused on cost cuts for 2019 to speed up decision-making and result in an annual savings of $100 million. The company earned $136 million, or 44 cents per share, in the first quarter ended May 4, compared to $139 million, or 45 cents per share, a year ago. That exceeded the average analyst estimate of 33 cents. Net sales fell to $5.50 billion, roughly in line with analysts expectations, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. “With comp results coming in better-than-feared, we’d expect a modest relief rally out of Macy’s today, but would not be chasing the stock,” Gordon Haskett analyst Chuck Grom said in a note. The company also repeated its previously issued financial forecast for the year."

-13.525894298101399," Macy's new restructuring to cut 100 senior jobs, save $100 million annually (Reuters) - Macy’s Inc, the largest U.S. department store chain, said on Tuesday it would cut 100 senior management positions to reduce costs and improve profitability, and reported holiday same-store sales growth short of Wall Street’s expectations. A multi-year program will also help the Cincinnati-based company improve its supply chain and tightly control its inventory, it said. The job cuts, at the vice presidential level and higher, combined with its supply chain and inventory actions, are expected to yield annual savings of $100 million, starting in the current fiscal year, 2019. “The steps ... will allow us to move faster, reduce costs and be more responsive to changing customer expectations,” Chief Executive Jeff Gennette said. Last month, Macy’s tempered expectations for the holiday season by slashing its fiscal 2018 revenue and profit forecast on weak demand for women’s sportswear, seasonal sleepwear, fashion jewelry, fashion watches and cosmetics. Its shares plunged 18 percent. Department stores in recent quarters had shown signs they were finding ways to cope with declining mall traffic and tough competition from online seller Amazon.com Inc, helped by a robust economy and strong consumer spending in 2018. In 2019, Macy’s said it would invest in categories where the company already has strong market share such as dresses, fine jewelry, women’s shoes and beauty, as well as revamp 100 stores, up from the 50 stores it remodeled last year. It also plans to build out its off-price Backstage business to another 45 store locations. Shares of the company were roughly flat at $24.27 in morning trading, after rising as much as 5 percent earlier. Macy’s, which has closed more than 100 locations and cut thousands of jobs since 2015, reported a smaller-than-expected 0.7 percent rise in holiday quarter same-store sales on Tuesday, below the company’s own expectations. “Core EPS guidance came in a bit lighter than we were expecting, but no worse than buy-side fears,” said Gordon Haskett analyst Chuck Grom. “Inventory levels are heavier than normal for Macy’s, but the company appears to have done a good job clearing through excess levels following a softer holiday period,” he said. The company now forecasts adjusted profits for fiscal 2019 between $3.05 to $3.25 per share, below analysts estimates of $3.29."

-3.6542487617982524," Macy's cuts profit, sales forecast after weak holiday season (Reuters) - Macy's Inc M.N shares plunged 18 percent on Thursday after the department store operator slashed its full-year profit and sales forecast on the back of an anemic holiday season, sending a chill through the wider retail sector. Macy’s said its sales slowed after a good start to the holidays, and flagged particular weakness in women’s sportswear, sleepwear, fashion jewelry, fashion watches and cosmetics. Its comparable sales over the critical November and December months rose 1.1 percent. Department stores in recent quarters had shown signs they were finding ways to cope with declining mall traffic and tough competition from online seller Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O. A robust economy and strong consumer spending had been expected to offer further relief. Kohl's Corp KSS.N reported similarly muted comparable sales growth for the holidays, sending its shares down as much as 9 percent. Target Corp TGT.N was down nearly 4 percent even after the retailer posted relatively strong holiday sales growth of nearly 6 percent. Those results come as overall sales for the 2018 U.S. holiday shopping season hit a six-year high as shoppers were encouraged by early discounts, according to a Mastercard report in late December. But some are already calling for an industry-wide slowdown this year. “It looks like the consumer is in good shape but generally there are signs of some slowing in the economy,” said Ken Perkins, founder of research firm Retail Metrics. Consumer confidence in 2019 is seen as likely to be strained by rising U.S. interest rates, the ongoing trade spat with China, market volatility due to concerns over global growth and political deadlock in Washington. A recession could hit many department stores particularly hard, some industry watchers said. “If we do get a recession, the retailers that can offer strong value in both physical bricks-and-mortar format, as well as a good online experience will do best,” said Jeff Yastine, senior equities analyst at investment advisory firm Banyan Hill Publishing. “That leaves many department store chains, like Macy’s, on the outside of this trend until they can figure out how to marry ‘luxury’ with the convenience of online retail that consumers want,” he said. Macy’s now expects 2 percent growth in comparable sales for the full year, down from a previous outlook of 2.3 percent to 2.5 percent growth. Its comparable sales, including licensed departments, rose 1.1 percent during November and December. The retailer is now calling for diluted earnings per share of $3.95 to $4.00 for fiscal 2018, excluding settlement charges, impairment and other costs. Its previous guidance issued in November called for EPS of $4.10 to $4.30. “The holiday season began strong - particularly during Black Friday and the following Cyber week, but weakened during the mid-December period and did not return to expected patterns until the week of Christmas,” Jeff Gennette, chairman and chief executive officer at Macy’s, said in a statement. The retailer has reported four consecutive quarters of same-store sales growth, and its shares had risen more than 80 percent over a 12-month period heading into Thanksgiving. Kohl’s reported comparable sales growth of 1.2 percent during the final two months of 2018, down sharply from 6.9 percent a year earlier. Target was a bright spot with comparable sales growth of 5.7 percent during November and December, up from growth of 3.4 percent in the same period last year, but its performance on Thursday was overshadowed by its rivals. Target said its sales were helped by higher customer visits and strong online sales during the holiday season, as well as strength in with toys, baby and seasonal gifts. It expects same-store sales growth of about 5 percent for the fourth quarter through January. Target reaffirmed its full-year earnings and sales forecast, putting it on track for its fastest full-year comparable sales growth since 2005."

The dollar rebounded after hitting a three-month low, while U.S. Treasury prices erased early gains after a soft 30-year bond auction and as Powell said the U.S. central bank will “substantially” reduce the size of its balance sheet. MSCI’s all-country index, which came under some pressure after U.S. stocks briefly retreated following Powell’s comments on the Fed balance sheet, recovered to trade up 0.11 on the day. Thursday marked the index’s fifth straight session of gains. Speaking at the Economic Club of Washington, Powell reiterated that the U.S. central bank has the ability to be patient on monetary policy given stable price measures. He downplayed predictions from policymakers suggesting interest rates would be raised twice more this year. “The stock market is wanting to hear dovish speak from the Fed, whether it’s Powell or the governors or the presidents,” said Willie Delwiche, investment strategist at Baird in Milwaukee. Stocks around the globe started Thursday weaker after China said three days of talks with the United States that wrapped up on Wednesday had established a “foundation” to resolve differences. But it gave few details on key issues at stake, including a scheduled U.S. tariff increase on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. The trade war between the two economic giants has disrupted the flow of hundreds of billions of dollars of goods.

Sales from Macy’s stores and third-party licensees open for more than 12 months is now expected to grow about 2 percent, lower than a prior forecast of between 2.3 percent and 2.5 percent. “The holiday season began strong – particularly during Black Friday and the following Cyber Week, but weakened in the mid-December period and did not return to expected patterns until the week of Christmas,” Chief Executive Officer Jeff Gennette said in a statement. Macy's weak holiday forecast follows downbeat numbers from rivals J.C. Penney Corp JCP.N and Kohls Corp KSS.N. Macy’s said that the overall sales growth was largely offset due to underperformance in certain categories such as women’s sportswear, fashion jewelry and cosmetics as well as challenges in fulfilling online orders after a fire in its distribution center. The Cincinnati-based company also cuts its forecast for sales and profit for the year, after it had raised its annual earnings outlook in anticipation of a strong holiday shopping season in November.

Still, its shares fell over 1 percent in premarket trading, hurt by a disappointing performance at rival Kohl's Corp KSS.N, analysts said. Kohl's shares were down 5.4 percent in premarket trading after reporting anemic comparable sales growth of 1.2 percent during the final two months of 2018, from 6.9 percent a year earlier. Target expects same-store sales growth of about 5 percent for the fourth quarter through January, while comparable sales had grown 3.4 percent in the November-December period last year. All of the retailer’s core categories grew during the holiday season, with toys, baby and seasonal gift items being the strongest. Target reaffirmed its full-year earnings and sales forecast, putting it on track for the strongest full-year comparable sales growth since 2005. “Target’s sales performance... is an early indicator that the consumer was willing and able to spend this holiday,” said Moody’s retail analyst Charlie O’Shea. The robust sales numbers indicate consumer confidence has largely not been impacted by rising market volatility due to concerns over slowing global growth and a political deadlock in Washington. Target said store pickup and drive-up surged more than 60 percent from a year ago, and accounted for a quarter of the company’s digital sales in the holiday period.

-23.42433043063363," Macy's raises profit forecast before key holiday season (Reuters) - Macy's Inc M.N raised its annual earnings forecast on Wednesday, signaling a strong holiday shopping season ahead, encouraged by good performance at its stores and its growing online business. The largest U.S. department store chain, which has closed more than 100 locations and cut thousands of jobs since 2015, also reported much better than expected profit and sales for the third quarter, boosted by double-digit growth at its online shopping service. Like many other major U.S. retail names, Macy’s has been struggling with plummeting mall traffic and a defection of customers to a new range of online and fast-fashion stores. In response, the 160-year old company has invested heavily in its off-price Backstage stores, loyalty program, mobile app and website, while improving brick-and-mortar stores by equipping them with mobile checkouts and new shop layouts. Shares in the company rose as much as 4 percent in early trade, but later gave up those gains. They last traded down 2.4 percent at $34.94. They are still up about 40 percent this year. “I would characterize the quarter as solid but not great,” said research firm Retail Metrics founder Ken Perkins. “Strong economic growth coupled with low unemployment should be driving strong sales across retail.” Chief Executive Jeffrey Gennette said the Cincinnati, Ohio-based retailer was so encouraged by the expansion of its Backstage discount stores, which sell excess and off-season inventory at steep discounts, it would invest more marketing dollars toward the initiative. The company expects the additional marketing, which launched last month, to increase awareness of Backstage and bring new customers into the store, Gennette said. Sales from Macy’s stores and third-party licensees open for more than 12 months rose 3.3 percent, the fourth consecutive quarterly increase. That topped analysts’ average estimate of a 2.82 percent increase, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Macy’s now expects adjusted earnings of between $4.10 and $4.30 per share in fiscal year 2018, compared with an earlier forecast of $3.95 to $4.15 per share. The owner of the Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s chains said net income attributable to shareholders rose to $62 million in the third quarter from $30 million a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, Macy’s earned 27 cents per share, nearly double analysts’ average estimate of 14 cents. Net sales rose 2.3 percent to $5.40 billion, matching expectations."

-18.031158608753177," Citigroup settles U.S. robo-signing case tied to consumer bankruptcies NEW YORK (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc C.N will pay $5 million to address ""robo-signed"" proofs of claim filed in consumer bankruptcy cases involving 71,448 Macy's-branded credit card accounts, the U.S. Department of Justice announced on Monday. The proofs of claim were filed between 2012 and 2015 by employees of a third-party vendor who did not review their contents, and had been working on behalf of Citigroup affiliate Department Stores National Bank, which issued the accounts. According to a filing with the U.S. bankruptcy court in Gainesville, Georgia, Citigroup learned of problems with the vendor’s practices after it began servicing the accounts in July 2015, and notified the government the following month. Citigroup has complied with applicable bankruptcy signing requirements since it began filing proofs of claim on DNSB’s behalf, and has adopted procedures to avoid a recurrence, the filing said. The $5 million payment will be distributed pro rata, with affected cardholders receiving refunds of about $70 each. Citigroup, based in New York, said in a statement it was pleased to resolve the matter, and regretted any inconvenience to customers. Macy's Inc M.N was not accused of wrongdoing. Creditors file proofs of claim in bankruptcy cases to set forth how much they believe they should recover and why. Robo-signing involves the systematic approval of documents that have not been read. The practice was a cause of the U.S. housing crisis last decade, enabling marginal borrowers to obtain loans they did not qualify for."
-10.529803917890918," Macy's to hire 80,000 for holiday rush, boost online staffing (Reuters) - Macy’s Inc said on Wednesday it would hire 80,000 temporary workers for the holiday season, in line with last year’s initial hiring, and deploy more hands to cater to the avalanche of online orders expected in the shopping period. The department store chain said 23,500 seasonal workers would be employed at its online fulfillment centers across the United States, 5,500 more than last year. The rest of the hires would be based in call centers, shop floors at Macy’s and Bloomingdale’s and will support the company’s annual Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York. Seasonal hiring plans of retailers indicate their sales expectations for the holiday season, which starts a day after Thanksgiving and continues into early January, and accounts for nearly a third of their annual sales. The company, like its department store peers, has been investing heavily to beef up its online presence and lure back shoppers who had shifted to rivals such as e-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc. Macy’s online business clocked double-digit growth in the second quarter, with sales through its mobile app rising more than 50 percent in the first half of its fiscal year from a year earlier. Last September, Macy’s said it would hire 80,000 temporary workers, but added 7,000 in December following strong Black Friday sales. “There’s a lot of optimism among retailers for the holidays, but a lot of them are waiting for after Thanksgiving to assess exactly what they need in terms of temporary hires,” Neil Saunders, Managing Director of GlobalData Retail said. Peer Kohl’s Corp said in June it would begin hiring seasonal workers for the back-to-school, fall and holiday seasons “earlier than ever.” Macy’s shares, which have risen about 44 percent this year, were up 0.5 percent at $36.54 in early trading."

-7.229803256396977," Margin worries send Macy's shares tumbling after profit beat (Reuters) - Macy's Inc M.N on Wednesday said its gross margins would shrink in the fall season as delivery expenses rise, overshadowing a quarterly sales and profit beat and sending shares down more than 13 percent. The department store operator reported a surprise rise in quarterly same-store sales and also upped its full-year sales and profit forecasts. Overall quarterly sales were lower, though better than analysts had expected. Macy’s has been closing stores, controlling inventory, building its Backstage off-price business and selling or leasing out prime real estate properties to grapple with falling mall foot traffic and online competition. It launched a revamped loyalty program in October 2017, which executives on Wednesday said would result in a bigger hit from delivery expenses to third-quarter margins this year. “We expect our gross margin rate as a percent of sales to be slightly up for the year, this means that the gross margin rate is assumed to be slightly below last year in the fall,” Chief Financial Officer Paula Price said on a post earnings call. The sharp share move also comes after Macy's stock has surged 66 percent this year, far outperforming the S&P 500 retailing index .SPXRT. It has more than doubled since touching a seven-year low of $17.40 in November. Shares were last down 13.8 percent at $36.02 on Wednesday. “Macy’s shares may be selling off this morning as result of profit taking, despite healthy second-quarter beat and raised full-year guidance,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Brian Tunick said. Macy's results also pulled down shares of rival department store operators J.C. Penney Co Inc JCP.N, Nordstrom Inc JWN.N and Kohl's Corp KSS.N, all down more than 5 percent. Research firm Retail Metrics analyst Ken Perkins echoed Tunick’s view, while also flagging a dip in second-quarter margins. Perkins said based on his calculation Macy’s gross margins dipped 20 basis points in the quarter even when some full-price selling should have translated into higher margins. Macy’s operates its namesake stores as well as Bloomingdale’s and Bluemercury. Macy’s now expects full-year adjusted earnings of $3.95 to $4.15 per share, up from its prior forecast of $3.75 to $3.95 per share, and total sales to range from flat to up 0.7 percent, also above its previous target. Macy’s executives said they had seen particular strength in men’s, kids, furniture and activewear, and that they were encouraged by a good start to the back-to-school season at the end of the second quarter. Sales at Macy’s stores open more than 12 months, including sales in departments licensed to third parties, rose 0.5 percent, compared with the average analyst estimate of a 0.9 percent drop, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The sales and EPS outlook raise, analysts said, suggests expectations for continued momentum in the business through the year despite harder year-over-year comparisons and unfavorable timing shifts. Excluding one-time items, the company earned 70 cents per share, much higher than analysts’ expectations of 51 cents. Net income attributable to Macy’s shareholders rose to $166 million in the second quarter ended Aug. 4 from $111 million a year earlier. Net sales fell 1.1 percent to $5.57 billion, but still topped estimates of $5.55 billion."

-7.308659564442781," Home furnishing chain RH to limit China sourcing as tariffs loom (Reuters) - Upscale home furnishing chain RH RH.N said on Friday it expects to significantly reduce the amount of goods sourced from China by fiscal 2019 to mitigate the impact of the proposed new tariffs by the United States. The company expects to cut its sourcing from China to as low as about 25 percent by the end of fiscal 2019 from the estimated 35 percent imports in 2018 and 40 percent in 2017. The United States, on July 10, threatened to slap tariffs on Chinese goods worth $200 billion, including on furniture and lighting products, days after enforcing levies on goods worth $34 billion. RH is one of the first U.S. companies to react to the new tariff proposal that includes day-to-day consumer goods such as pet food and handbags. Until now, tariffs had only focused on capital goods such as steel and aluminum. RH’s said its plan to lower its share of imports from China would help it reduce the impact of tariffs on its fiscal 2018 and 2019 financial results. Its scale in the luxury home furnishing market will help raise prices if needed, RH said, adding it would work with its vendors to evaluate sourcing alternatives. The company’s stock rose nearly 5 percent to $139.31 in early trading, recovering from Wednesday’s losses after a Goldman Sachs note said the new tariffs would hurt gross margin of home furnishing retailers and force them to raise prices. RH sourced about 77 percent of its products from Asia in 2017, of which the majority of it came from China, according to a filing."

9.03314536893594," Macy's lifts forecast, says 'every week was good' in first quarter (Reuters) - Macy’s Inc raised its full-year profit forecast on Wednesday and reported better-than-expected quarterly and same-store sales, helped by strong international tourism spending, a new loyalty program and a greater assortment of products offered in stores. The U.S. department store chain also issued comparable sales growth guidance that topped estimates, boosting its shares 10 percent to $32.92 by midday. “Tax cuts, bonuses and good tax refunds have all been a windfall to consumers who have responded by increasing spending,” said Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail. “This rising tide has floated most retail boats, Macy’s among them.” Like its peers, the Cincinnati, Ohio-based department store chain faltered in the past few years as it struggled to adjust to a fiercely competitive retail landscape where shoppers buy more goods online. Macy’s closed more than 100 stores since 2015 and cut thousands of jobs as mall traffic plummeted and customers defected to off-price and fast-fashion sellers. Macy’s also said it would end a joint venture agreement with Fung Retailing Ltd in China but would remain active on Alibaba’s e-commerce platform TMall as well as social media channels. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Gennette said on an earnings call the company saw double-digit growth in its digital business and continued healthy consumer spending. It also had significant improvements in international tourism, which was up 10 percent - its best numbers since 2014. “We have the digital growth obviously percolating and we are driving that very successfully,” Gennette said. “Brick-and-mortar needed a lot of work.” Macy’s changed its loyalty program by opening it up to more shoppers and by offering free shipping and discounts to its highest-spending customers. Executives told investors the changes were paying off as planed, drawing more shoppers online and in stores and boosting sales overall. The company said it has focused on selling a more curated assortment of trendier clothes. First-quarter same-store sales rose 4.2 percent, easily beating Wall Street’s 1.4 percent average estimate, as sales rose at its Bloomingdale’s, Bluemercury and its own Macy’s stores. This was the second straight quarter of same-store sales growth. Shares of rival department stores also rose. J.C. Penney was up 2.5 percent, Kohl’s rose 2 percent, Nordstrom, which reports its first-quarter earnings on Thursday, was up 1.5 percent and Target Corp was up 3.5 percent at around midday. For fiscal year 2018, Macy’s intends to open approximately 100 Backstage stores, 18 of which the company opened in the first quarter, make it easier for shoppers to check out quickly using their mobile devices by improving its checkout technology and aims to maintain a healthy inventory position. The quarter also benefited from a change in accounting that shifted its Friends & Family promotional program from the second quarter to the first, the company said. The company said it now expects adjusted profit of $3.75 to $3.95 per share for the year, up from a prior forecast of $3.55 to $3.75. It also forecast full-year comparable sales at its owned plus licensed stores to rise between 1 percent and 2 percent. Analysts on average were expecting 0.3 percent growth, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net income attributable to Macy’s shareholders nearly doubled to $139 million, or 45 cents per share, in the first quarter ended May 5. Excluding one-time items, it earned 48 cents per share. Net sales rose 3.6 percent to $5.54 billion in the quarter. Analysts on average were expecting earnings of 37 cents per share and revenue of $5.36 billion. “The quarter was good every month - in fact, every week,” Chief Financial Officer Karen Hoguet said on a call with analysts. “Spirits are up.”"
