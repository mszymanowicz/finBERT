-8.085300756678643," NextEra doubles down on renewables as energy transition gathers steam (Reuters) - NextEra Energy Inc, the world’s largest producer of wind and solar energy, said on Tuesday it would invest more in renewable power generation, hoping to make the most of a global transition from dirty fossil fuels to cleaner sources of energy. NextEra, one of the biggest beneficiaries of the burgeoning energy transition, posted a loss due to write-downs related to a delayed U.S. natural gas pipeline but said renewable power generation continued to grow as people and businesses shift to lower-emission power. The company’s shares have tripled in the last five years, boosting the its value to around $170 billion, nearly as much as that of oil major Chevron Corp. (Graphic: NextEra stock gains while oil giants sink: ) NextEra said on Tuesday it plans to add as much as 30 gigawatts of renewable projects to its portfolio by 2024, well above Morningstar analysts’ estimate of a 20 gigawatts addition. NextEra Chief Executive Officer Jim Robo said rising public support for addressing climate change makes it possible that the new administration of President Joe Biden will act to extend incentives and introduce new policy supports favoring the company. “We anticipate our development program to be further enhanced by an ability to attract new, non-traditional customers, particularly in the commercial and industrial sector, as improving renewable economics are increasingly aligned with corporate objectives,” Robo added. The company beat estimates for adjusted income on the back of strong demand for its projects, but an impairment charge of $1.2 billion on its investments in the Mountain Valley natural gas pipeline forced the company to report its first net loss since at least 2010. The Mountain Valley pipeline, from West Virginia to Virginia, is one of the several oil and gas pipelines under construction that have been delayed by regulatory and legal fights with states and environmental groups. NextEra attributed its write-down to legal and regulatory challenges, saying the project is facing “substantial delays in reaching commercial operation and increased costs associated with those delays.” The pipeline is still expected to enter service by the end of 2021. NextEra posted a net loss of $5 million in the three months ended Dec. 31 due to the impairment. It had reported a net income of $975 million a year earlier. Shares were down 2.1% on Tuesday, off from an all-time closing high of $86.87 hit Monday. However, Matt Breidert, portfolio manager at sustainable investment firm Ecofin, said the fourth quarter was “meaningless to the story or stock.” He said they see the regulatory backdrop improving for renewable developments, which should help the stock. Excluding the charge and other items, NextEra earned 40 cents per share, beating analyst estimates of 37 cents, as demand for renewable power generation surged."

10.940291008721973," Elliott calls on Evergy to reengage with NextEra Energy after bid report (Reuters) - Activist investor Elliott Management Corp on Tuesday asked Evergy Inc EVRG.N to immediately restart deal talks with NextEra Energy Inc NEE.N, after Reuters reported that the U.S. power utility had turned down a roughly $15 billion bid. NextEra, the world’s largest producer of wind and solar energy, made an all-stock bid valuing Evergy in the mid $60s-per-share, Reuters reported on Monday. Evergy told NextEra the price was inadequate, and that it required a detailed plan to overcome regulatory hurdles to a deal, the report added, citing sources. Elliott, which in January disclosed an economic interest of 11.3 million shares in Evergy, said NextEra was “uniquely positioned to deliver superior benefits for all of Evergy’s stakeholders, including providing lower electric rates for Evergy’s customers.” Evergy had solicited takeover bids earlier this year under pressure from Elliott. It attracted NextEra’s interest, but Evergy decided last summer to remain independent. Evergy said on Tuesday there was currently no offer or bid from any third party and reiterated it would focus on executing its transformation plan. The Sustainability Transformation Plan is the best risk-adjusted path forward and that all appropriate steps are being and have been taken to maximize shareholder value, the company said in an e-mailed statement. It was unclear whether NextEra will make a new approach, Reuters reported, citing sources. One of the sources said NextEra had no immediate plans for a new bid. U.S. utilities are under pressure to gain scale through dealmaking, as they grapple with the swelling costs of serving a larger population, upgrading aging infrastructure and investing in cleaner energy production."

10.940291008721973," Exclusive: NextEra Energy in $15 billion bid for Evergy - sources NEW YORK (Reuters) - NextEra Energy Inc, the world’s largest producer of wind and solar energy, has made a roughly $15 billion all-stock acquisition offer for U.S. power utility Evergy Inc, people familiar with the matter said on Monday. Evergy turned down the offer in recent days and it is unclear whether NextEra will make a new approach, said the sources, who requested anonymity because the matter is confidential. One of the sources added that NextEra had no immediate plans for a new bid. The offer for Evergy shows how NextEra is seeking to capitalize on a rally in its stock by pursuing large acquisitions. In September, NextEra was rebuffed by Duke Energy Corp, another major utility it approached with a takeover offer. NextEra’s bid valued Evergy in the mid $60s-per-share, said the sources. Evergy informed NextEra that the price was inadequate, and that it also required a detailed plan to overcome regulatory hurdles to a deal, the sources added. Evergy shares ended trading on Monday up 5.4% at $57.99. NextEra shares ended trading down 0.3% at $75.51, giving the company a market capitalization of $148 billion. Evergy solicited takeover bids earlier this year under pressure from hedge fund Elliott Management Corp. It attracted NextEra’s interest, but Evergy decided last summer to remain independent. It is not clear what prompted NextEra’s latest takeover approach. “As previously discussed... we conducted an extensive strategic review process, that process is complete, and our attention is focused on our sustainability transformation plan,” an Evergy spokeswoman said. NextEra did not respond to a request for comment. U.S. utilities are under pressure to gain scale through dealmaking, as they grapple with the swelling costs of serving a larger population, upgrading aging infrastructure and investing in cleaner energy production. Evergy was formed out of the merger of Great Plains Energy and Westar Energy in 2018 and serves 1.6 million customers in Kansas and Missouri. The company is searching for a new leader after chief executive Terry Bassham announced in August that he would step down. The Kansas City, Missouri-based company has also unveiled a standalone plan that calls for infrastructure investment and cost reductions. NextEra, the largest U.S. utility, owns two electric companies in Florida serving more than 5.5 million customers, and is the biggest producer of renewable energy. It briefly surpassed oil giant Exxon Mobil Corp’s market capitalization last month to take over as the most valuable U.S. energy company, underscoring the value that investors place on cleaner forms of energy. NextEra CEO James Robo said on Sept. 30 that he would not pursue hostile acquisitions because major deals in his industry could only clear regulatory hurdles if companies worked co-operatively. Regulators are often concerned that mergers could push up electricity bills for consumers or weigh on capital expenditure. The Great Plains/Westar tie-up took around two years to complete, after the Kansas regulator demanded changes. NextEra has previously lost out on acquisitions by not acquiescing to regulatory demands. When it sought to buy Texan power utility Oncor for $18.4 billion four years ago, NextEra was asked by the state regulator to operate Oncor at arm’s length. NextEra declined, arguing it needed board control and the ability to extract cash to fund its dividend. It lost the deal as a result, with Oncor subsequently acquired by Sempra Energy. NextEra had previously spent two years trying to buy Hawaiian Electric Co for $4.3 billion. It abandoned that deal in 2016, amid regulatory concerns the benefits promised by NextEra to local consumers were insufficient. To be sure, NextEra has managed to complete acquisitions. It paid $5.1 billion for Gulf Power from Southern Co in 2018, pledging to cap transmission rates in Florida for five years, according to a regulator statement at the time."

8.581815474316233," NextEra's Duke Energy bid faces plethora of regulatory hurdles NEW YORK (Reuters) - NextEra Energy Inc Chief Executive James Robo joked last week he does not pursue small acquisitions because the reward is not worth the “brain damage” of getting them past regulators. Yet his $65 billion-plus pursuit of Duke Energy Corp will only pay off if he can overcome major regulatory hurdles in putting together the biggest ever U.S. utility deal, industry experts said. Duke rebuffed a takeover approach from NextEra, the world’s largest producer of renewable energy from wind and sun, as inadequate, Reuters reported last Wednesday. The deal would help accelerate Duke’s transition away from coal- and gas-fired power plants. NextEra, already the largest U.S. utility with a home base in Florida, would need approval from regulators in all six states where Duke operates: Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, North Carolina, Ohio and South Carolina. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission would also need to assent, and the Department of Justice has authority to review the deal for potential antitrust issues. “This kind of deal would raise significant regulatory considerations,” said Jane Rueger, a partner at law firm Perkins Coie. Florida would be the area of most regulatory concern, according to industry experts. Of the 8.1 million customers served by privately owned electric utilities in 2019, 7.3 million got their power from Duke or NextEra units Florida Power & Light and Gulf Power, according to the Florida Public Service Commission. Utilities typically pledge to sell assets or build extra transmission lines to assuage anti-monopoly concerns. Duke Energy made such concessions to regulators in the Carolinas and Florida when it bought Progress Energy for $13.7 billion in 2012. NextEra, however, would have to give up significant business in Florida and risk upsetting its relationship with regulators ahead of negotiations on new caps being agreed on the electricity rates it can charge, Guggenheim Securities analysts said. “They could dilute their constructive Florida footprint, chasing after synergies and earnings accretion in less perceived quality states,” the analysts wrote. NextEra did not respond to a comment request. Duke declined to comment. NextEra has previously lost out on acquisitions by not acquiescing to regulatory demands. When it sought to buy Texan power utility Oncor for $18.4 billion four years ago, NextEra was asked by the state regulator to operate Oncor at arm’s length. NextEra declined, arguing it needed board control and the ability to extract cash to fund its dividend. It lost the deal as a result, with Oncor subsequently acquired by Sempra Energy. NextEra had previously spent two years trying to buy Hawaiian Electric Co for $4.3 billion. It abandoned that deal in 2016, amid regulatory concerns the benefits promised by NextEra to local consumers were insufficient. To be sure, NextEra has clinched an acquisition in Florida in the past. It paid $5.1 billion for Gulf Power from Southern Co in 2018, pledging to cap transmission rates for five years, according to a FERC statement at the time. NextEra could also be called upon to make investments in local communities as part of the deal, industry experts said. Utilities are major employers in their state, and regulators often look for commitments that go beyond their standard demands for investment in their grids and restrictions on electricity rate hikes. Duke has a foundation that contributes around $30 million annually to projects across its coverage area, including offering grants to local organizations and struggling customers, according to its website. The company also sponsors the center for performing arts in Raleigh, North Carolina. NextEra also promotes its work in local communities on its website, including volunteering, education programs and sponsorship. The company raised $5.2 million for such projects in 2019. “You would have to explain to each state regulator how a deal would impact their jurisdiction, from the perspective of ratepayers, jobs created or lost, where headquarters will be maintained, and how investment would flow there in the future,” Rueger, the Perkins Coie lawyer, said."
9.909222960012752," NextEra Energy CEO rules out hostile M&A after offer to Duke Energy (Reuters) - NextEra Energy Inc NEE.N Chief Executive James Robo said on Wednesday that the largest U.S. power utility would not embark on a hostile takeover, a day after reports surfaced it had made an approach to Duke Energy Corp DUK.N in what would be the sector's biggest-ever acquisition. Duke Energy, which has a market capitalization of $65 billion, has rebuffed NextEra’s acquisition interest, according to a person familiar with the matter who confirmed a Wall Street Journal report about the approach that was published on Tuesday. Details of the bid could not be learned. Speaking at a Wolfe Research conference on Wednesday, Robo declined to comment specifically on NextEra’s approach to Duke, but said that major acquisitions in his industry could only happen if the companies involved worked co-operatively. “State regulators are really important to getting approvals on getting things done, and you can’t do anything that isn’t mutual in this industry,” Robo said. A spokesman for Duke Energy declined to comment. Its shares were trading up 7.5% at $88.57 on Wednesday. NextEra shares were down 1.7% at $278.12, giving it a market capitalization of $136 billion. NextEra owns two electric companies in Florida serving more than 5.5 million customers. It is also the world’s largest generator of renewable energy from wind and sun. Duke Energy operates in North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky, serving more than 7.7 million households. All six states would need to sign off on any acquisition of the company, and federal utilities regulators would also need to assent. “While we have no doubt NextEra would be interested in Duke, securing state regulatory approval could be challenging, particularly in the Carolinas which represent over 60% of Duke’s regulated earnings base,” Jonathan Arnold, principal at Vertical Research Partners, wrote in a note on Wednesday.

PG&E’s power purchase agreements are valued at up to $42 billion and the matter of whether the company can walk away from them belongs exclusively in bankruptcy court, Judge Dennis Montali of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court in San Francisco said in a June 7 decision. Montali, who is overseeing PG&E’s bankruptcy, rejected the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s argument that it has “concurrent jurisdiction” over the agreements. The dispute involving the regulator, PG&E and companies from which it buys power has been one the most contentious fights so far in the San Francisco-headquartered utility’s bankruptcy, launched in January. PG&E sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection expecting billions of dollars in liabilities stemming from devastating California wildfires in recent years traced to its equipment.

8.484005027472932," Florida Power & Light parent adds to Florida assets with $5.1 billion deal (Reuters) - NextEra Energy Inc NEE.N said on Monday it is expanding in Florida by buying some utilities from Southern Co SO.N for $5.08 billion, the latest move in a sector consolidating as heavy debt drags on the industry. Consumers, companies and governments across the United States are looking for ways to be more energy efficient, limiting growth and revenue for many power companies. NextEra, the parent of Florida Power and Light Co, said it would buy almost all of Southern’s assets, including Gulf Power Co and Florida City Gas. Atlanta-based Southern is building the first nuclear power plant in the United States in decades. It plans to use the transaction proceeds to cut debt. Southern had about $44.46 billion in long term debt as of Dec. 31, 2017, according to the latest annual filing. For NextEra, buying Southern’s power and gas assets gives it a bigger foothold in Florida, which is seeing an economic boom. “A key element of the rationale for the transactions are the excellent complementary geographic and strategic fit of both Gulf Power and Florida City Gas with FPL,” Chief Executive Officer James Robo said on a call with investors. Florida Power and Light is the biggest utility in the state. “Compared to many other regions in the U.S., an attractive and expanding Florida economy should benefit Gulf Power and Florida City Gas over the long term,” Robo said.
