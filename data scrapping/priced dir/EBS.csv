-50.25627798148433," Vaccine manufacturing deals power Emergent BioSolutions profit beat (Reuters) - Emergent BioSolutions Inc beat fourth-quarter profit expectations on Thursday, benefiting from manufacturing deals to help produce COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics. The company has entered into more than seven manufacturing collaborations, including with AstraZeneca Plc, Johnson & Johnson, Novavax, Vaxart Inc, Humanigen Inc, since the outbreak of the pandemic. The company said it has set up a large-scale manufacturing infrastructure, which will help it produce and supply drug substance for the vaccine candidates on time. “We’re right online with doing that, timing-wise, as well as capability for both Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca Plc,” Chief Executive Robert Kramer said on a conference call with analysts. “Specific to J&J, their short-term goal is to provide as many as 100 million doses to the U.S. government in the first half of 2021. And we’re right on schedule to support that.” Revenue from the company’s contract development and manufacturing (CDMO) unit rose to $199.1 million in the quarter from $25.5 million a year ago. “Expect our CDMO business to continue to be a significant contributor to our future growth and expansion,” Kramer said. Excluding items, Emergent earned $3.67 per share in the quarter ended Dec. 31, ahead of the analysts’ average estimate of $3.19.

Ltd will begin making a drug substance used in Johnson & Johnson’s COVID-19 vaccine candidate that is in early to mid-stage trials, the companies said on Thursday. J&J aims to produce more than 1 billion doses of its vaccine candidate, and has struck a similar deal with U.S.-based Emergent BioSolutions Inc to boost manufacturing. Large-scale trials for the potential vaccine, Ad26.COV2-S, are set to start by October. Twenty-eight vaccine candidates are currently in human trials, according to the World Health Organization, as the global death toll from the novel coronavirus nears 750,000. Biological E. Ltd in an email also said it has signed a licensing agreement with Houston-based Baylor College of Medicine to develop a COVID-19 vaccine. Other Indian companies developing or manufacturing potential COVID-19 vaccines include the Serum Institute, Wockhardt Ltd, Cadila Healthcare Ltd and Panacea Biotec Ltd. India on Thursday reported a record daily jump of 67,000 coronavirus infections, taking its total to nearly 2.4 million.

16.947356553443214," Emergent to partner with Mount Sinai for potential plasma-derived COVID-19 therapy (Reuters) - Emergent BioSolutions Inc said on Wednesday it would jointly develop and run trials for its antibody product derived from plasma of recovered COVID-19 patients as a potential treatment with the Mount Sinai Health System. Under the partnership, which also includes biotech company ImmunoTek Bio Centers, Emergent will conduct a study on high-risk frontline healthcare workers and military personnel taking the experimental therapy within 72 hours after a possible exposure to the coronavirus. The study will be aided by the $34.6 million in funding from the U.S. government granted to Emergent. The clinical research will evaluate if treatment with Emergent’s antibody product will help protect high-risk individuals and limit the spread of COVID-19. Emergent will also submit an experimental marketing application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the product. The company’s shares rose 5.1% to $94.03 in Wednesday morning trade. According to David Reich, president and chief operating officer of the Mount Sinai Hospital, a plasma-derived antibody product may be an effective option in the prevention and treatment of COVID-19 currently, in the absence of a vaccine. It may also prove helpful for patients who do not develop immunity from a vaccine. ImmunoTek will extend its FDA license to enable plasma collection onsite at New York City’s Mount Sinai and also train staff to assist in plasma collection procedures. In April, Emergent was awarded $14.5 million by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to develop its treatment based on plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients."

17.568661101392188," Emergent BioSolutions to buy Narcan maker Adapt Pharma (Reuters) - Emergent BioSolutions Inc said on Tuesday it would buy privately held Adapt Pharma, beefing up its portfolio with Narcan, the only FDA approved needle-free emergency opioid overdose treatment. Addiction to opioids - mainly prescription painkillers, heroin and fentanyl - has emerged as a serious public health crisis in the United States, especially in rural areas. According to the U.S. Centers For Disease Control And Prevention, the epidemic here over 70,000 lives last year. President Donald Trump in March recommended death penalty for drug dealers after declaring the addiction crisis a public health emergency in October. Trump also introduced an Adapt Pharma executive, Mike Kelly, during an event in New Hampshire and said he wanted to give first responders access to life-saving drugs that can reverse overdoses. Emergent’s shares were up marginally in after-hours trading on Tuesday, while those of Opiant Pharmaceuticals, Adapt’s commercial partner, jumped nearly 42 percent. Emergent said it had “no plans to change” Narcan’s pricing and would maintain the 40 percent discount available to state and local governments and non-profit organizations. “Adapt has put together a strong, durable supply chain of partners to support the manufacture of the product. We do not intend to disrupt that,” an Emergent executive said on a conference call with analysts. Narcan, often carried by police officers and medical teams, contains the chemical naloxone hydrochloride and was approved as a nasal spray in 2015. The U.S. Surgeon General released a public health advisory earlier this year urging more Americans to carry naloxone. Tuesday’s deal comprises an upfront cash-and-stock payment of $635 million and up to $100 million in cash linked to sales-based milestones through 2022, Emergent said. The company will also gain access to Adapt’s pipeline of treatments to address opioid overdose, as well as about 50 employees in the United States, Canada and Ireland. The deal fits in with Emergent’s strategy of focusing on treatments for public health threats and the company is currently developing a vaccine for bat-borne Nipah virus. Acquisitions will remain a priority in the growth approach, the company said. Emergent is looking to achieve or exceed its $1 billion in revenue goal in 2020 and as part of the plan recently acquired specialty vaccines company PaxVax."
