LaSalle said its board determined that Pebblebrook’s unsolicited proposal received on Aug. 21 constituted a “superior proposal”, ahead of a shareholder vote on the deal on Thursday. Pebblebrook has offered 0.92 of its common shares per LaSalle stock, with an option to receive $37.80 per share in cash up to a maximum of 30 percent in aggregate of the consideration.

A person familiar with the deal told Reuters last month that Blackstone had decided against raising its offer. If LaSalle reaches an agreement with Pebblebrook, Blackstone will walk away with a $112 million breakup fee.

-2.389259188759208," LaSalle says latest Pebblebrook bid may top Blackstone's offer (Reuters) - U.S. hotel owner LaSalle Hotel Properties LHO.N said on Monday Pebblebrook Hotel Trust's PEB.N unsolicited bid last week may be bigger than an offer from private equity firm Blackstone Group LP BX.N in May. Pebblebrook raised the cash component of its $37.80-per-share offer to a maximum of 30 percent of LaSalle’s outstanding shares from 20 percent. “The board...has determined that the unsolicited, non-binding proposal received from Pebblebrook on Aug. 21, 2018 could reasonably be expected to lead to a superior proposal,” LaSalle said in a statement. Meanwhile, private equity firm Blackstone, which had made an all-cash offer of $33.50 per share, has decided against raising its offer, a person familiar with the deal said. If LaSalle reaches an agreement with Pebblebrook, Blackstone will walk away with a $112 million breakup fee. However, LaSalle said its board has not changed its recommendation in support of the Blackstone deal. The shareholders are set to vote on the deal on Sept. 6. Last week, shareholder advisory firms Glass Lewis & Co and ISS recommended against a buyout deal by Blackstone, while LaSalle shareholder HG Vora Capital Management Llc said it intended to vote against the deal.

-2.389259188759208," LaSalle says Pebblebrook's offer may lead to higher bid than Blackstone Aug 27 (Reuters) - U.S. hotel owner LaSalle Hotel Properties said on Monday Pebblebrook Hotel Trust’s unsolicited, non-binding proposal may lead to a “superior proposal,” intensifying a takeover battle with Blackstone Group LP. Last week, Pebblebrook increased the cash component of its $37.80-per-share offer to a maximum of 30 percent of LaSalle’s outstanding shares from 20 percent. Blackstone had made an all-cash offer of $33.5 per share to LaSalle in May. “The board’s determination follows a careful and thorough review of the Pebblebrook proposal in consultation with outside financial and legal advisors,” LaSalle said in a statement."
-8.09419011409982," ISS recommends against LaSalle deal with Blackstone (Reuters) - Shareholder advisory firm ISS on Friday recommended against a buyout deal of LaSalle Hotel Properties LHO.N by private equity company Blackstone BX.N, in another boon for LaSalle's unwelcome suitor Pebblebrook Hotel Trust PEB.N. ISS’s recommendation to LaSalle shareholders follows that of another shareholder advisory firm, Glass Lewis & Co, on Thursday. Blackstone’s $3.7 billion all-cash offer is facing uncertainty as Pebblebrook on Tuesday stepped up its overtures with a higher offer to LaSalle’s board of trustees two weeks ahead of the final shareholder vote. ISS said Blackstone’s all-cash bid was less than the current value of Pebblebrook’s competing bid, and less than the current value of LaSalle shares. “While the adage “cash is king” has many axiomatic applications, it is less relevant as reasoning to forego investments that add up as being superior on a risk/reward basis,” the ISS report said. LaSalle and Blackstone declined to comment. Pebblebrook Chief Executive Jon E. Bortz said the company was pleased with the ISS and Glass Lewis recommendations that LaSalle shareholders vote against the proposed deal with Blackstone. LaSalle, which has interests in hotels including the Park Central San Francisco and Westin Michigan Avenue in Chicago, has so far resisted Pebblebrook’s proposal on the basis that the mix of stock and cash in its offer is riskier for shareholders than the outright cash deal offered by Blackstone. A two-thirds majority is needed for the deal approval by shareholders. Pebblebrook has accrued a 9.8 percent stake in LaSalle, making it the fourth-largest shareholder behind hedge fund HG Vora Capital Management, which has also backed the Pebblebrook bid."
-7.785698551987314," Glass Lewis recommends against Blackstone in LaSalle deal (Reuters) - Shareholder advisory firm Glass Lewis & Co has recommended that shareholders of hotel owner LaSalle Hotel Properties LHO.N oppose the buyout by private equity firm Blackstone Group LP BX.N, in a victory for LaSalle's unwelcome suitor Pebblebrook Hotel Trust PEB.N. Blackstone’s $3.7 billion all-cash offer is facing a wave of fresh uncertainty as Pebblebrook on Tuesday stepped up its overtures with a higher offer to LaSalle’s board of trustees two weeks ahead of the final shareholder vote. “Under the circumstances, we believe cause exists for investors to question the value offered in LaSalle-Blackstone proposal, and the August 21, 2018 revised offer only bolsters our view as it widens the spread over the board recommended cash offer,” the Glass Lewis report said. LaSalle, Pebblebrook and Blackstone could not immediately be reached for comment LaSalle has so far resisted Pebblebrook’s proposals on the basis that the mix of stock and cash in its offer was riskier for shareholders than the outright cash deal offered by Blackstone. “The LaSalle board has stated it is reviewing Pebblebrook’s revised offer, and in our view, the altered terms provide LaSalle directors an opportunity for further engagement with Pebblebrook,” Glass Lewis said. The upcoming vote already faced uncertainty given that it a two-thirds majority is required for approval and Pebblebrook had accrued a 9 percent stake in LaSalle, making it the fourth largest shareholder behind hedge fund HG Vora Capital Management, which also backed the unwelcome bid. For LaSalle, which has interests in hotels including the Park Central San Francisco and Westin Michigan Avenue in Chicago, the Blackstone deal represents “immediate and certain cash value” and is expected to close as early as this month, the company has previously said. “Pebblebrook’s proposal, which includes 80 percent stock consideration, continues to fail to address the significant price risks and uncertainties for LaSalle shareholders,” LaSalle said in June when siding with Blackstone’s bid. Influential proxy adviser ISS is expected to release its own recommendation later this week."
-5.1340715648227855," LaSalle Hotel backs Blackstone bid, says Pebblebrook offer not superior (Reuters) - U.S. hotel owner LaSalle Hotel Properties LHO.N on Monday sided with Blackstone Group LP's BX.N $3.7 billion all-cash offer to buy the company, as it looks to thwart Pebblebrook Hotel Trust's PEB.N takeover bid. LaSalle said Pebblebrook’s raised cash-and-stock proposal of $37.80 per share last week was not superior as 80 percent of the offer comprised stock, which the company considers a risk for its shareholders. Pebblebrook stood pat, saying its offer remained outstanding and unveiled on Monday a 9 percent stake in LaSalle, almost double its previously disclosed holding. That makes it the fourth largest shareholder in LaSalle, behind hedge fund HG Vora Capital Management which has supported Pebblebrook’s bid. The company, whose portfolio includes the InterContinental Buckhead Atlanta and The Westin San Diego Gaslamp Quarter, said in a statement it was surprised that LaSalle’s board did consider its offer superior, despite being $375 million higher than Blackstone’s bid. LaSalle, which has interests in hotels including Park Central San Francisco and Westin Michigan Avenue, the Blackstone deal represents “immediate and certain cash value” and is expected to close as early as August, the company said. “Pebblebrook’s proposal, which includes 80 percent stock consideration, continues to fail to address the significant price risks and uncertainties for LaSalle shareholders...” LaSalle said in a statement. Shares of both LaSalle and Pebblebrook were down about 0.5 percent in early trading."

-7.125710938981033," Pebblebrook sweetens offer for LaSalle Hotel (Reuters) - Pebblebrook Hotel Trust PEB.N on Monday raised its offer to buy fellow U.S. hotel owner LaSalle Hotel Properties LHO.N, seeking to scuttle Blackstone Group LP's BX.N $3.7 billion deal with the company. Pebblebrook said its latest offer for LaSalle represented an implied price of $37.80 per share, and carried a 13 percent premium to Blackstone’s $33.50 offer. Shares of LaSalle, which owns interests in hotels including Park Central San Francisco and Westin Michigan Avenue, were up 1.4 percent at $35.67. LaSalle said its board will review Pebblebrook’s proposal, and determine a course of action that is in the best interest of its shareholders. Pebblebrook said its latest offer “takes into account” the $112 million termination fee LaSalle agreed to pay to Blackstone. In May, LaSalle decided to sell itself to private equity firm Blackstone BX.N for $3.7 billion in cash, rejecting a cash-and-stock offer from Pebblebrook. Pebblebrook said LaSalle shareholders will have the choice of receiving a fixed amount of $37.80 in cash for each LaSalle share they own, or 0.92 of a Pebblebrook share. Pebblebrook said the cash part could be a maximum of 20 percent of the outstanding LaSalle shares. If the number of shares opting for cash exceeds 20 percent, those shareholders will be subject to pro rata cutbacks. “It is clear that the value of our offer is substantially greater .... It is also clear that LaSalle shareholders expect to receive far more value for their shares than Blackstone’s agreement,” Pebblebrook Hotel Trust Chief Executive Officer Jon Bortz said. Pebblebrook previously sweetened its $3 billion-plus offer in April, after LaSalle said the initial bid undervalued the company. The Maryland-based company, which went public around a decade ago, owns several hotels, including InterContinental Buckhead Atlanta and The Westin San Diego Gaslamp Quarter."

(Reuters) - LaSalle Hotel Properties LHO.N decided to sell itself to private equity firm Blackstone Group LP BX.N for $3.7 billion in cash, rejecting a cash-and-stock offer from rival Pebblebrook Hotel Trust PEB.N. Blackstone’s offer values LaSalle at $33.50 per share and represents a premium of 5 percent to LaSalle’s closing price on Friday. Pebblebrook’s offer, which values the U.S. hotel owner at $35.89 per share based on Friday’s close, consisted of a maximum of 20 percent in cash and the rest in stock. “Blackstone offer provides immediate and certain cash value,” Baird Equity Research analyst Michael Bellisario wrote in a note. LaSalle Chairman Stuart Scott said it was in touch with 20 potential buyers and signed confidentiality agreements with 10 of them before deciding on Blackstone’s offer. Shares of LaSalle rose above Blackstone’s offer and were trading up 5.6 percent at $33.70 on Monday, indicating that the market was expecting a higher offer. “We believe Pebblebrook would likely have to raise its offer by 5-10 percent,” SunTrust analyst Patrick Scholes said in a note, adding that the company may not want to be involved in a bidding war. Pebblebrook could not be immediately reached for a comment on whether it would raise its offer further. Pebblebrook had raised its offer on April 20 to $31.75 per share, after LaSalle rejected its previous bid, saying it undervalued the company. Blackstone usually buys hotels and other real estate holdings at a discount, restructures them and sells for a profit. The private equity firm exited Hilton Worldwide Holdings Inc HLT.N on Friday after nearly 11 years by selling about 5.8 percent stake or 15.8 million shares in the hotel chain operator for about $1.32 billion. Citigroup Global Markets Inc and Goldman Sachs & Co LLC were the financial advisers, while Goodwin Procter LLP and DLA Piper LLP (US) were the legal advisers to LaSalle. Morgan Stanley & Co.

10.459819306320313," Pebblebrook boosts offer for U.S. hotels owner LaSalle (In April 16 story, corrects Pebblebrook’s existing ownership of LaSalle) (Reuters) - Pebblebrook Hotel Trust PEB.N has sweetened its $3 billion-plus offer to buy U.S. peer LaSalle Hotel Properties LHO.N after the owner of high-end locations including 'W' Los Angeles saw an initial bid rebuffed last month. Pebblebrook Chief Executive Officer Jon Bortz is seeking to regain control of LaSalle a decade after he left the company, which he founded and headed while working for global real estate group Jones Lang LaSalle in the early 1990s. LaSalle said it would review Pebblebrook’s revised proposal. The company has started to explore a sale by talking to other companies and investment firms, but has so far been unable to agree on terms of engagement with Pebblebrook, including a mutual nondisclosure agreement, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. LaSalle initially requested an 18-month standstill that would prevent Pebblebrook from agitating or making public disclosures on the bid, one of the sources said. LaSalle subsequently whittled this down to three months, but Pebblebrook has refused to accept these terms because it believes they would hamper its bid, the source added. Pebblebrook owns a 4.8 percent stake in LaSalle. Pebblebrook is concerned that LaSalle’s proposed terms would not allow it to engage with other LaSalle and Pebblebrook shareholders, according to the sources. Bortz said the reaction from LaSalle investors to Pebblebrook’s overtures, which have driven LaSalle shares 20 percent higher since its announcement last month, had been “overwhelmingly” positive. The new offer is a 5.8 percent improvement over the previous deal and at 0.8944 of a Pebblebrook common share for each LaSalle share, implies an offer price of $31.75 per share. That values the deal at more than $3 billion. LaSalle shareholders would own more than 50 percent of the combined company. Pebblebrook’s previous offer was at an implied price of $29.95 per share. “Pebblebrook is disappointed that LaSalle has not responded to our revised proposal and continues to refuse to negotiate an agreement to combine the two companies which would benefit the shareholders of both companies,” Bortz said. “Investor reaction has been overwhelmingly in favor of a combination, and we are ready to move forward swiftly.” In a letter to LaSalle dated April 13 that Pebblebrook made public on Monday, Pebblebrook said it would offer LaSalle a 30-day “go-shop” period to find another buyer after its signs a deal if it agrees to a 10-day period of exclusive deal negotiations. When it announced its first offer last month, Pebblebrook said the resulting company would be the second-biggest lodging real estate investment trust in the United States. Both firms, which own but do not operate hotels, describe themselves as focused on upscale properties. Based on the offer, LaSalle shareholders would own more than 50 percent of the combined company. The trust’s website says it currently owns 41 hotel properties compared with the 28 listed by Pebblebrook. The offer also gives each LaSalle shareholder an option to be paid cash for up to a maximum of 15 percent of the value of their holding, Maryland-based Pebblebrook said. Pebblebrook would issue its common and preferred shares to fund the deal and assume or repay LaSalle Hotel’s term loans and first mortgage loans. Other Pebblebrook properties include the InterContinental Buckhead Atlanta and The Westin San Diego Gaslamp Quarter. Maryland-based LaSalle, which made its public debut in 1998, owns interests in hotels including Park Central San Francisco and Westin Michigan Avenue. Raymond James and BofA Merrill Lynch are the financial advisers for Pebblebrook, while Citigroup Global Markets Inc and Goldman Sachs & Co LLC are advising LaSalle Hotel. Up to Friday’s close, LaSalle Hotel shares were up 20.5 percent from the day before Pebblebrook disclosed its initial, bid while those of Pebblebrook had risen about 6 percent."
