Kosmos, which plans to drill three additional exploration wells in the Gulf of Mexico in 2020, said it expects about $24 million of exploration expenses related to the drilling of the Oldfield well. Back in August 2018, Chief Executive Officer Andrew Inglis said the exit of a number of exploration and production companies from the Gulf of Mexico to onshore shale projects had created a space in the market for Kosmos to exploit. Kosmos reported its first success from the Gulf Of Mexico exploration program in June 2019. Last year, the company said it continues to high grade its multi-year infrastructure-led exploration prospect inventory in the Gulf of Mexico."

The companies were excluded in 2016 based on advice from the fund’s ethics watchdog, which found “an unacceptable risk related to petroleum prospecting off the coast of Western Sahara”. The companies made it clear they had discontinued their business in the area and the exclusion was revoked, the central bank, which manages the fund, said in a statement. The fund was created from the proceeds of Norway’s oil industry and operates under ethical guidelines set by parliament. It owns shares in 9,100 companies, 1.4 percent of the world’s listed equity, so its decisions to drop or reinstate firms from its investments carry considerable weight among investors."

-40.09378310848014," UPDATE 1-Kosmos Energy abandons well offshore Suriname, plans more tests in region (Adds details on well, comments on Q3 production) Oct 10 (Reuters) - Oil and gas company Kosmos Energy said on Wednesday it was abandoning an offshore well in Suriname after it failed to find oil, the second well plugged in the region in recent months, but added that it plans to continue testing in the basin due to its potential. The company also said it expects to generate substantial free cash flow in 2018, allowing it to initiate a dividend in the first quarter of 2019. Kosmos said it encountered high-quality reservoir at the Pontoenoe-1 exploration well in Block 42 offshore Suriname, but the primary exploration objective proved to be water bearing and did not find commercial hydrocarbons. “We are in the early stages of exploring the emerging Suriname-Guyana basin.... We believe there is significant remaining potential in Block 42,” Kosmos Chief Executive Officer Andrew Inglis said, adding that the company’s current plan was to test the next prospect in 2020. The NYSE-listed company holds rights in Block 42 under a production sharing contract with the Suriname government-owned Staatsolie Maatschappij Suriname NV. Kosmos said production in Ghana continues to grow after the Jubilee turret remediation work and the new wells brought online at both Jubilee and TEN during the quarter. The company, which ended the third quarter with net debt of about $2 billion and liquidity of about $650 million, said it now expects 2018 capital expenses to be about $400 million. Shares of the company had not opened on the London Stock exchange at 0742 GMT, with a wide bid-ask spread of 52 pence per share.

-22.178482777353032," Kosmos Energy expands into Gulf of Mexico with $1.23 billion DGE buy NEW YORK (Reuters) - Kosmos Energy KOS.N has agreed to acquire Deep Gulf Energy (DGE) from its private equity owner for $1.23 billion, according to a bourse filing on Monday, expanding the deepwater oil and gas firm's operations into the Gulf of Mexico. Dallas-based Kosmos, which currently operates in Africa and South America, will pay $925 million in cash and $300 million in Kosmos common stock to acquire DGE, with the transaction expected to close towards the end of the third quarter. Acquiring DGE’s business will increase Kosmos’ production by more than 50 percent to 70,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed) from around 45,000 boed now, with the company’s estimated reserves rising 40 percent to around 280 million barrels of oil equivalent, the statement said. “The best deepwater assets can compete with the best of shale, and now is a good time to enter the Gulf of Mexico,” Andrew Inglis, chairman and chief executive officer of Kosmos, said in the statement. Speaking with Reuters, Inglis said the exit in recent years of a number of exploration and production companies from the Gulf of Mexico to invest more in onshore shale projects had created a space in the market for Kosmos to exploit. It had been able to secure high quality assets without the level of competition that energy firms might experience in other places, he said. In the London Stock Exchange statement, Kosmos noted the DGE acquisition would be “immediately accretive” to the company and the “significant free cash flow” that the assets would help generate would allow it to pay a dividend to shareholders starting in the first quarter of 2019. DGE had been backed by energy-focused private equity firm First Reserve since 2005, according to the company’s website. Evercore and Goldman Sachs acted as financial advisers to Kosmos, according to the bourse statement."

The costs relate to a rig contract with Seadrill that Tullow cancelled in December 2016 after Ghana set a drilling moratorium on its TEN offshore oil and gas field, which is located in waters then claimed by both Ghana and Ivory Coast. Tullow is lead operator of the project, in which Kosmos Energy, Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, Ghana National Petroleum Corporation and PetroSA also hold stakes. A London judge ordered Tullow this month to pay Seadrill around $254 million, saying Tullow was wrong to end a contract between the companies on the grounds of force majeure over a maritime border dispute in West Africa. The company had originally said its partners would pay in keeping with their stakes in the project, but Kosmos challenged this. A panel of arbitrators at the International Chamber of Commerce ruled in favour of Kosmos, which means Tullow will not be able to claim back Kosmos’ $50.8 million share of the Seadrill cost and will have to reimburse Kosmos around $14 million in legal and rig demobilisation costs. A Tullow spokesman said Anadarko has answered Tullow’s cash call over the Seadrill ruling. Anadarko had no immediate comment. A Tullow spokesman on Wednesday said the company had decided not to appeal the original court ruling. With Tullow’s 47 percent stake in TEN and its duty to pay costs for Ghana National Petroleum Corporation’s (GNPC) stake, the British company had expected to pay around $140 million net. “The challenge for Tullow is to demonstrate that the events of 2015-16 are behind it, and in H2/18 it is pushing ahead with a strategy that involves doing more with less and unlocking the upside potential in East Africa,” RBC said in a note. Tullow is working towards final investment decisions for its Kenya and Uganda projects. (Reporting by Shadia Nasralla, editing by Louise Heavens and Jan Harvey)"

Tullow cancelled the contract for Seadrill’s West Leo rig in December 2016 after Ghana set a drilling moratorium on its TEN offshore oil and gas field which is located in waters then claimed by both Ghana and Ivory Coast. An international tribunal last year ruled in favour of Ghana, allowing Tullow, the lead operator of the project, to resume drilling. Kosmos Energy, Anadarko Petroleum Corporation, Ghana National Petroleum Corporation and PetroSA also hold stakes. “We are disappointed with the decision and maintain the view that it was right to terminate the West Leo contract for force majeure. Tullow will now examine its options, including seeking leave to appeal the judgment,” Tullow said in a statement. With Tullow’s 47 percent stake in TEN and its duty to pay costs for Ghana National Petroleum Corporation’s (GNPC) stake, the British company expects to pay around $140 million net, it said. It expects to get the rest of the money back from its TEN partners. Tullow said last week it had set aside $128 million for the dispute with Seadrill. It will decide within the coming 21 days whether it will appeal the ruling. Meanwhile, Kosmos is in a separate dispute with Tullow over the contracting of the rig at the International Chamber of Commerce which might result in Tullow having to pay the fees for Kosmos’ 20 percent stake in the field. A decision in the Kosmos case is due shortly. It would cost Tullow around $50 million should it lose. Tullow’s shares dropped as much as 4.3 percent on Tuesday, but recovered to trade broadly flat. RBC said in a note that Tullow’s projects in East Africa, including Uganda and Kenya where final investment decisions are due late this year and 2019 respectively, outweigh the negative impact of Tuesday’s ruling. Boosted by its Ghana output, Tullow last week raised its 2018 production outlook to 86,000-92,000 barrels of oil per day. (Reporting By Shadia Nasralla; Editing by Kirsten Donovan)"
18.42436943474053," UPDATE 1-Kosmos Energy abandons Suriname well after it fails to find oil (Adds details on drilling outlook, background) June 26 (Reuters) - Oil and natural gas explorer Kosmos Energy Ltd said on Tuesday it was abandoning one of its wells offshore Suriname after it failed to find oil. Kosmos said its drilling program would remain unchanged given the independent nature of the prospects and that it was still in the early stages of exploring the basin. The company said its Anapai-1A exploration well, located in Block 45 offshore Suriname, encountered high quality reservoirs in the targeted zones, but did not find hydrocarbons. Kosmos owns a 50 percent stake and is the exploration operator of Block 45, with Chevron Corp holding the remaining interest. The design for the well had to be reconfigured to address some issues, the company said in May, adding that it had spent about $20 million up until then on drilling it. The company said drilling will proceed as planned in the third quarter to test Pontoenoe, the first of up to three independent prospects in Block 42 offshore Suriname. Kosmos, Chevron and Hess Corp each own a third of Block 42. Energy companies have been pushing further west off the coasts of African oil producers such as Angola, Nigeria and Gabon. BP and Kosmos Energy moved closer to approving development of the Tortue natural gas field offshore Mauritania and Senegal in February after the two West African countries agreed to split production from the cross-border field. One of Komsos’ wells in Senegal’s Saint Louis Offshore Profond block also failed to find oil, the company had said in February, sending its shares down as much as 16 percent on the New York Stock Exchange the day it reported the news. Kosmos shares had not opened on the London Stock Exchange on Tuesday at 7:45 am GMT, with a wide bid and ask spread of 20 pence. The shares closed up marginally at 625 pence on Monday.
