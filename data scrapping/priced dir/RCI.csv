8.567912578823755," UPDATE 1-Rogers Communications misses revenue estimates as media business hit (Adds background, media revenue, profit) Jan 28 (Reuters) - Canada’s Rogers Communications Inc on Thursday reported fourth-quarter revenue that fell short of Wall Street estimates, as the company’s media business took a hit due to advertising shortfalls and the postponement of live sporting events. Revenue from the media segment, which includes television, radio broadcasting and digital media fell 23% to C$409 million ($318.31 million), as the NHL and NBA seasons due to begin during the quarter were postponed, Rogers said. The telecom operator’s total revenue fell to C$3.68 billion, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, from C$3.95 billion a year ago. Analysts expected revenue of C$3.79 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. This comes as Rogers’ wireless services revenue, which benefits from international roaming charges, fell as fewer people traveled overseas. The Toronto-based company also faces additional pressure to grow its subscriber base in the midst of stiff competition from other telecom players looking to bring in more customers on their new 5G networks. During the quarter the company added 114,000 subscribers who pay a monthly bill, versus 138,000 in the third quarter, due to a dip in store visits from renewed pandemic restrictions. Excluding items, the company earned 99 Canadian cents per share, compared with analysts’ estimates of 98 Canadian cents per share."

Revenue at Rogers’ media division plunged 50% to C$296 million in the quarter as the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted major sports activities in Canada and worldwide. The company said it expects the loss in media to continue till the fourth quarter. Sports revenue for the company which owns the Toronto Blue Jays baseball team were also impacted as live events were postponed in the quarter. Rogers also owns a 37.5% stake in Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment Ltd, which owns teams such as the Toronto Maple Leafs and the Toronto Raptors among others. Government-imposed store closures to stop the virus spread led to a decline in new subscriber additions and sale of equipment for telecom providers, some of which are also reeling from a cut in ad spend as live sports events are postponed. Revenue from roaming fell 90% in the quarter ended June 30 partly due to global travel restrictions, pulling revenue from wireless services down 13%. Revenue from its wireless equipment unit fell 17% on fewer device purchases and upgrades by existing customers. The company said it was seeing some signs of recovery in the market as lockdown measures ease and stores are allowed to re-open. “June saw a notable recovery in loading as most stores were starting to open and July is trending a little bit better as well”, Chief Financial Officer Anthony Staffieri said in an earnings call with analysts.

While telecom providers are benefiting from an increase in internet usage by customers stuck at home due to the COVID-19 pandemic, store closures have limited their ability to sell equipment and sign up new customers. Revenue from Rogers’ wireless segment, its largest business that includes internet service and equipment, slipped 2% to C$2.08 billion in the first quarter as demand dropped due to the virus outbreak and on fewer roaming calls.

Lack of “right” regulations in Canada to build 5G infrastructure puts the proposed investment at risk, Chief Executive Officer Joe Natale said. “As we enter the world of 5G, regulatory certainty is critical to investment,” Natale said on a post-earnings call. Canada is reviewing the security implications of 5G networks, including whether to allow China’s Huawei Technologies to supply network equipment. The Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) could not be immediately reached for comment. Countries including the United States, China, South Korea and Japan are in a race to speed up 5G adoption, hoping the technology will spur breakthrough in the development of smart cities and autonomous cars, among other things. “The race to 5G is not with other companies, it is with other countries,” Natale said on a post-earnings call. Rogers became Canada’s first cellphone services provider to offer 5G telecom services, as it started rolling out the technology in downtown Vancouver, Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal last week. The company has partnered with Sweden's Ericsson ERICb.ST for the technology needed to build its 5G network and has plans to expand to another 20 markets by the end of the year. Shares of the company were up nearly 4% in morning trade, as it posted higher year-over-year revenue and added 131,000 net wireless postpaid subscribers in the quarter ended Dec. 31.

Rogers, one of Canada’s largest wireless carriers, will launch first in downtown Vancouver, Toronto, Ottawa, and Montreal, before expanding into over 20 more markets by the end of the year, in advance of 5G-enabled devices becoming available this year, the statement added. “5G is the biggest technological evolution since the launch of wireless in Canada. We are making the right investments, building the right partnerships and deploying the right technology to bring Canadians the very best of 5G,” said Joe Natale, chief executive of Rogers Communications. The 5G networks will have speeds fast enough to download a movie to a smartphone in seconds, while allowing businesses to run ‘smart’ factories using connected robots, devices and sensors. Rogers has partnered with Sweden’s Ericsson to provide the technology needed to build the network. Canada is reviewing the security implications of 5G networks, including whether to allow China’s Huawei Technologies to supply 5G network equipment. The roll-out puts Rogers, which was founded in 1960 by a Canadian entrepreneur, ahead of its competition - Bell Canada, a unit of BCE Corp, and Telus Corp, Canada’s two other major telecoms companies. Bell is ready to launch similarly early-stage 5G networks when devices become available, the company said in an emailed statement. “Canada has the opportunity to lead the world in 5G if our regulatory environment continues to encourage wireless infrastructure investment,” the statement added. “Policies that hamper or restrict the significant capital investment required will lead to the opposite outcome.” Telus did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Canada’s top five telecom companies accounted for 85% of the broadcast and telecommunications industry’s C$67.6 billion ($50.8 billion) revenues in 2017 in Canada, the most recent government figures show. Rogers also said it was joining a global alliance with other major telecoms companies from around the world, to coordinate on delivery of 5G adoption. The other companies in the 5G Future Forum are U.S. firm Verizon, Mexico’s América Móvil, South Korea-based KT Corp, Australia’s Telstra and Vodafone in Europe.

The telecom company, which has been enduring tougher competition, added just 77,000 net postpaid wireless subscribers in the second quarter ended June 30, down from 122,000 new customers a year earlier. Rogers, among Canada’s Big Three telecoms, was the first in the country to introduce unlimited data plans last month, which was quickly followed by rivals BCE Inc’s Bell Mobility and Telus Corp. The company said 365,000 customers have already switched to the newly introduced “Infinite” data plan and their usage grew 50% within six weeks of its launch. Rogers expects a short-term moderation in growth with respect to the new data plan, Chief Financial Officer Anthony Staffieri said on a conference call. Analysts expect Canadian telecom companies to face near-term pressure as customers migrate to unlimited plans, which will affect average revenue per user (ARPU). However, the company’s wireless customers on an average paid C$56.73 ($43.15) a month for its services in the quarter, up from C$55.60 a year earlier.

1.546510498975747," Canada's Rogers holds fire on guidance after subscriber jump (Reuters) - Rogers Communications Inc RCIb.TO topped analysts' estimates for quarterly profit on Thursday as it drew greater numbers of subscribers into high-priced postpaid mobile phone contracts, but it stopped short of upgrading annual profit guidance. Canada’s largest wireless provider has been investing heavily in customer service and its various networks, leading to a net addition of 122,000 postpaid wireless subscribers, who pay for services monthly, during the quarter. That was up from the 93,000 users it added at the same time last year and 95,000 in the previous quarter. Several sector analysts, however, were taken aback that the company had not seen enough to raise its forecasts for this year and shares in the company fell 2.5 percent after opening in Toronto. “We were surprised that management did not raise guidance despite the strong year-to-date,” Phillip Huang of Barclays Capital Inc wrote in a note. Other analysts asked managers during an earnings call why the company was being conservative on its outlook given the results. The Toronto-based company said on average wireless customers paid 4 percent more per month in the quarter ended June 30. The postpaid churn rate - the pace at which subscribers leave - fell to its lowest in nine years at 1.01 percent. Efforts to improve services for customers has “reflected in reduced churn, reduced calls into our call center, along with the solid uptick in digital adoption,” chief executive Joseph Natale said on a call with analysts. An attempt by Peer Shaw Communications SJRb.TO to break into Canada's mobile market by undercutting existing players on price has put pressure on Rogers, Telus Corp T.TO and BCE Inc BCE.TO. Rogers said it invested C$240-million in its wireless business in the second quarter, up 52 per cent from the same time last year. For cable, it upped investment 24 percent to C$352 million. The company, which has been testing streaming device Ignite TV in Ontario in the face of competition from BCE’s upgraded fiber network, said the “soft-launch” had drawn positive reviews from customers in the second quarter. Natale said that Ignite TV was “just the beginning” of a connected home solution, that could remotely control everything from home security to lighting and temperature control. Rogers’ net income rose to C$538 million ($406.34 million), or C$1.04 per share, in the quarter, from C$528 million, or C$1.02 per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to C$3.76 billion from C$3.62 billion. Excluding one-time items, the company earned C$1.07 per share, while analysts had on average expected C$1.05, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S."
