37.26675067429467," TIMELINE-Nord Stream 2: the difficult birth of Russia's gas link to Germany Jan 27 (Reuters) - New U.S. President Joe Biden said his administration would review restrictions on the Nord Stream 2 (NS 2) gas pipeline project, a focal point of a wider discord between Moscow and Washington. A bill passed during Donald Trump’s presidency imposed sanctions on companies involved with the nearly-completed pipeline to bring Russian gas into Europe via Germany, undermining previous gas transits via Ukraine. Biden on Wednesday said he believed NS2 was a “bad deal for Europe”. Led by Russia’s Gazprom with Western partners, the pipeline, which doubles the capacity of the existing Nord Stream 1 (NS 1) link has attracted opposition in the European Union. The United States says NS 2 increases the EU’s reliance on Russia while NS 2 supporters say the United States is seeking to increase liquefied natural gas (LNG) sales to Europe. The following are significant moments in Nord Stream 2’s development: November: Gazprom and Western partners look into expanding the pipeline system by a further 55 billion cubic metres at an estimated cost of 9.5 euros ($11.3 billion). June: Gazprom, Royal Dutch Shell, E.ON, OMV, Wintershall and ENGIE agree to build the pipeline. [reut.rs/3haWiiv ] March: Eight EU governments object citing geopolitical reasons.

-13.103131016772116," U.S. hits former U.S. Bancorp exec with $450,000 penalty for money-laundering violations WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. government on Wednesday said it has hit a former risk officer at a subsidiary of U.S. Bancorp with a $450,000 civil penalty for his role in failing to prevent violations of the U.S. anti-money laundering law. Michael LaFontaine, the former chief operational risk officer at U.S. Bank NA, admitted he failed to take steps to implement and maintain an effective compliance program to prevent money laundering, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) said on Wednesday. U.S. Bancorp in 2018 agreed to a $613 million settlement with the U.S. Department of Justice over related charges. At the time, prosecutors said the lender failed to detect large numbers of suspicions transactions and concealed missteps from regulators. La Fontaine admitted responsibility in failing to make sure the bank was properly staffed to meet regulations, according to a filing from FinCEN, a unit of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. “Mr. LaFontaine was warned by his subordinates and by regulators that capping the number of alerts was dangerous and ill-advised,” FinCEN Director Kenneth A. Blanco said in a statement. “Over the course of Mr. LaFontaine’s employment, and continuing until May 2015, U.S. Bank failed to establish and implement an adequate (anti-money laundering) program and to report suspicious activity,” FinCEN said separately in a filing. A spokesman for LaFontaine said: “While he only had oversight of U.S. Bank’s (anti-money laundering) program during part of his tenure, he worked hard every day to manage risk and ensure compliance with all applicable laws and regulations.” The bank used automated transaction monitoring software to spot potentially suspicious activity, but it capped the number of alerts that software generated, FinCEN said in its statement. The improper caps were maintained for five years and curtailed law enforcement’s ability to target criminal activity, the regulator said in a separate filing."

6.588051172090992," Supreme Court to hear U.S. Bancorp pension plan dispute WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Friday agreed to consider reviving a class action lawsuit against U.S. Bancorp that accused it of mismanaging an employee pension plan in a manner that violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). The justices took up an appeal by the bank’s pension plan beneficiaries of a lower court ruling that threw out the lawsuit because the plan’s participants had not suffered any personal financial harm and lacked the necessary legal standing to sue. The plaintiffs said the plan’s administrators pursued an investment strategy that, beginning with the 2008 financial crisis, led to nearly $750 million in losses. The plaintiffs accused pension plan managers of breaching their fiduciary duty toward them from late 2007 to 2010 by adopting an overly risky and conflicted strategy of piling the plan’s assets solely into equities and a bank subsidiary’s mutual funds. Plan participants, led by retired Missouri bank accountant James Thole, filed the proposed class action lawsuit in 2013 in federal court in Minneapolis, where the company is based. ERISA, enacted in 1974, is a federal law that set up minimum standards for most voluntarily established retirement and health plans in private industry to protect beneficiaries. At issue is whether the plaintiffs can sustain their lawsuit alleging ERISA violations even if there is no current risk that the bank will not fulfill its pension obligations. The lawsuit alleged that the 2008 stock market crash caused the plan’s assets to plummet in value, causing it to be underfunded. The St. Paul, Minnesota-based 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in 2017 threw out the lawsuit because in the course of the litigation the bank made contributions and returned the plan to a surplus. The 8th Circuit said that since the plan had become overfunded there was no risk of underpayment of participants’ benefits, eliminating the basis for a lawsuit. Backed by President Donald Trump’s administration, the plaintiffs urged the justices to hear their appeal and revive the lawsuit. The Justice Department told the justices that pension plans may frequently swing between overfunded and underfunded. “It would be bizarre to tether a plaintiff’s standing - and thus a federal court’s power to hear a case - to such a volatile and arbitrary metric,” the Justice Department said in a legal filing. The court will hear arguments in the case during its next term, which begins in October, with a ruling due before June 2020."

-0.6652662106258056," UPDATE 1-Nigeria's First Bank redeems $300 mln Eurobond before maturity (Adds details) LAGOS, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Nigeria’s First Bank said on Tuesday it had redeemed a $300 million Eurobond before maturity and had paid all bondholders. The seven-year bond was issued in 2013 at 8.25 percent and had been due to be repaid in 2020. First Bank announced its intention last month to repay the debt before maturity and said on Tuesday it had made the payment after obtaining necessary approvals. It said the redemption had no impact on its capital ratios and that it had built up dollar liquidity over the past year. Nigerian banks cut lending last year due to weak economic growth and foreign currency risk. However, several of them are eyeing loan growth this year, citing economic improvements and especially as the central bank introduces liquidity to the banking sector targeting credit to manufacturers. First Bank said it did not plan to issue another Eurobond in the near term, because it had ample liquidity to meet its foreign and local currency funding needs. News of the redemption came after the market close. Shares in FBN Holdings, the bank’s holding company, closed up 0.51 percent.
