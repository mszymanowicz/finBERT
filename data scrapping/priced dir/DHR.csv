6.389452180901256," U.S. government signs deal to make more COVID-19 vaccine components (Reuters) - The U.S. government has entered an agreement with life sciences company Cytiva, a unit of Danaher Corp, to expand the manufacturing of products needed to make COVID-19 vaccines, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) said on Tuesday. Under the deal, Cytiva will receive about $31 million to scale up manufacturing of vaccine-related products, including cell cultures and hardware such as bioreactors used for the culturing of cells and antibodies. The grant will help the company ramp up the manufacturing capabilities of its Massachusetts and Utah facilities. The U.S. government has till date agreed to pay more than $1.1 billion to purchase needles, syringes, vials and supply kits, as well as expand manufacturing capacity for COVID-19 vaccines and therapeutics in the United States, the HHS said. “By expanding capacity now, not only do we help deliver these products as quickly as possible, but we also return manufacturing to America, boosting the economy and preparing us for future crises,” HHS Secretary Alex Azar said in a media statement. Cytiva is among the primary suppliers to several companies currently working with the U.S. government to develop COVID-19 vaccines."

19.36232415189768," KKR hires ex-Danaher executive for industrial deals NEW YORK (Reuters) - Private equity firm KKR & Co Inc KKR.N said on Monday it had hired former Danaher Corp DHR.N executive Dan Daniel to bolster its team that focuses on acquiring and operating industrial businesses in the United States. Daniel, who served as executive vice president at Danaher from 2008 till March this year, is expected to become chief executive of an industrial company that KKR will acquire, and help improve its performance, KKR’s co-head of Americas private equity Pete Stavros said in an interview. He added that the coronavirus-induced economic slowdown presents opportunities for KKR to acquire companies. “With demand being down in the industrial sector, it makes for an attractive buying environment,” Stavros said. Daniel managed Danaher’s industrial technologies and life sciences portfolios until 2017, and subsequently ran the company’s diagnostics and dental divisions. He is the second Danaher executive KKR has recruited. In 2017, KKR hired Ronald Voigt, who previously ran X-Rite Pantone, a Danaher subsidiary. Voight was eventually named CEO of Hyperion Materials & Technologies after KKR acquired the Worthington, Ohio-based industrial tools maker in 2018 from Sandvik AB SAND.ST for 4 billion Swedish knona ($432 million). KKR said its upcoming industrial acquisition will be made through its flagship $13.9 billion Americas Fund XII. All KKR industrial portfolio companies have an employee stock ownership program as an incentive to drive growth, the buyout firm said. In March, KKR merged Gardner Denver Holdings Inc, a pumps and compressors producer it acquired for $3.9 billion in 2013, with the industrial division of Ingersoll-Rand Plc, creating a new company, Ingersoll Rand Inc IR.N, which has a $12 billion market capitalization. KKR has kept a 17% stake in the new company."
22.51806373984131," U.S. FDA allows emergency use of Danaher's COVID-19 antibody test (Reuters) - Medical device maker Danaher Corp said on Monday its COVID-19 blood test for detecting if a person had ever been infected with the new coronavirus received emergency use clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The company’s unit Beckman Coulter said it had shipped the antibody tests to nearly 400 U.S. hospitals and laboratories, and has ramped up production to deliver more than 30 million tests a month. Antibody tests, which can indicate a certain degree of immunity in those who have had the virus, are seen crucial in safely reopening economies after weeks of lockdowns. High demand for the test has led to the entry of several fraudulent kits, prompting the FDA to tighten its rules over the tests. Danaher said its antibody test has a specificity rate of 99.6% and 100% sensitivity, suggesting very few chances of false positives and no false negatives. Abbott Laboratories’ antibody test has a specificity rate of 99.9%, while the rate stands at 99.8% for Roche Holding AG’s test. Both companies have received the FDA’s emergency use authorization for their tests. Danaher also said it has begun distribution of its antibody test in other countries that accept the U.S. FDA’s clearance."

South Korea’s antitrust watchdog approved the proposed acquisition in February on condition that they sell certain assets to address monopoly concerns. The EU approved it in December.

Danaher and GE said they expect the deal to close on March 31. To approve the acquisition, the FTC required the companies to sell 10 of its products to German-based Sartorius AG. The products include microcarrier beads, which provide a surface to grow cells, five chromatography products and a filtration system used in cell growth, among others. The five-member commission was split on whether the deal should be approved, with three Republicans voting yes and the two Democrats voting no."

The U.S. medical equipment maker Danaher got conditional EU approval in December for the deal after agreeing to sell five businesses to address worries about competition.

7.35949853257348," GE inks $21 billion biopharma sale to Danaher in U-turn under Culp (Reuters) - General Electric said on Monday it would sell its biopharma business to Danaher Corp for $21.4 billion in the biggest strategy reversal since Lawrence Culp took over as the industrial conglomerate’s chief executive in September. GE rejected an approach by Danaher for that business a year ago. But its stance changed after Culp was appointed CEO and GE board’s became more open to a deal, according to people familiar with the negotiations who requested anonymity to discuss them. As a result, GE will receive some $20 billion in net proceeds which it will use to trim its debt pile, which stood at $121 billion at the end of December. Both GE’s and Danaher’s shares jumped on news of the deal, though GE still faces significant hurdles in recovering its former corporate glory. It lost two-thirds of its market value in the last two years amid a series of operational and investment missteps. Among its challenges are mismanagement of orders and operations in its power business, and dealing with its toxic long-term care insurance liabilities in its GE Capital arm. “(The GE-Danaher deal) unfortunately doesn’t solve the real issues which comes back to power. That’s what took the stock down, and that’s still going to take some time play out,” said Richard Grasfeder, a portfolio manager at Boston Private Wealth LLC, which held about 478,204 shares in GE as of the end of 2018, down from 787,600 shares a year earlier. Culp said on Monday the sale to Danaher, where he was instrumental in revitalizing the company as its CEO, was a pivotal milestone in efforts to turn around GE, a 126-year old conglomerate. “It demonstrates that we are executing on our strategy by taking thoughtful and deliberate action to reduce leverage and strengthen our balance sheet,” Culp said in a statement. The biopharma sale also propelled a broad rally in GE’s roughly $120 billion of bonds, which had taken a pounding in late 2018 as it became clear that earlier restructuring efforts were falling short and that the company would need to take more aggressive action to address its debt load in particular. Larry Culp “has earned his stripes. It is clear that nobody in his job before him - John Flannery or Jeff Immelt - would have probably been able to pull off this transaction with Danaher,” William Blair & Co analyst Nicholas Heymann said. “And the price Danaher is paying GE is two times our expectations. This is a home run. It really turns the page now for GE to address liquidity concerns,” Heymann adds. Until recently, the company had plans to spin off the entire healthcare unit. Culp, however, said in January that GE would sell nearly half of the unit. Sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday that GE will put the initial public offering of the unit on hold until the deal with Danaher closes, expected in the second half of the year. This would mean that GE is likely to retain access to the earnings and cash flows of the remaining healthcare businesses for a longer period of time, alleviating some cash concerns, even as the power business struggles, said Rene Lipsch, lead GE analyst at Moody’s. The purchase is also the biggest yet for Danaher, which has a history of deal-making, and half of its revenue has come from companies it has acquired in the past seven years. The deal will expand Danaher’s presence in the biopharma industry, providing it with access to tools for research and development of drugs. Shares of the medical equipment maker rose more than 9 percent to a record $124.07. Danaher expects to add 45 cents to 50 cents per share to its adjusted profit in the first full-year after the deal closes, and does not expect any “significant” anti-trust challenges. “These are really complementary businesses when you look across the portfolio of the product line on GE biopharma’s side and our side,” said Danaher’s Chief Executive Officer Thomas Joyce on a call with analysts. The biopharma business accounted for 15 percent of GE’s healthcare business revenue in 2018. It makes instruments and software that support the research and development of drugs. The sale leaves GE’s healthcare unit with its medical device unit, which makes X-ray, CT scan and MRI machines, and its pharmaceuticals diagnostic unit. The announcement also further eased concerns about GE’s solvency that had grown markedly last year, reflected in a surge in the price for GE credit default swaps (CDS) during the fourth quarter, a form of insurance against default. On Monday, GE’s CDS prices sank to their lowest since mid-October. GE, which reported lower-than-expected fourth-quarter profit in January, is expected to provide its 2019 outlook on a call on March 14."
7.35949853257348," GE debt rallies, bond insurance price drops on Danaher deal (Reuters) - General Electric Co bonds rallied broadly on Monday after the company struck a deal to sell its biopharma business to Danaher Corp for $21.4 billion and said it would use cash from the deal to ease its massive debt burden. Yields on GE bonds, which move in the opposite direction of their price, fell to the lowest in about four months across dozens of debt securities and the risk premium demanded by investors in exchange for holding GE paper declined. The price to insure its bonds against default also sank, registering their largest one-day drop in at least three years, according to data from IHS Markit. The price increase on GE’s roughly $120 billion of bonds was the latest leg in a recovery so far this year after they took a pounding in late 2018 when its new chief executive, Larry Culp, said earlier restructuring efforts were falling short and that the company would need to take more-aggressive action to address its debt load in particular. (GRAPHIC: Dozens of GE bonds rally after Danaher deal announcement - tmsnrt.rs/2EybQ01) Culp slashed GE’s quarterly dividend to just a penny a share and has since struck a raft of deals to sell assets. The bulk of proceeds have been pledged toward working down its debt, which at one point in late 2018 was roughly twice GE’s market capitalization as its stock price plunged to a low of $6.66 a share in December. The three main credit rating agencies - Moody’s Investors Service, S&P Global Markets and Fitch Ratings - peg GE debt at just three notches above junk bond levels. For much of the fourth quarter of 2018, its bonds were trading as though they were no longer investment-grade securities. GE bonds’ broad underperformance last year, when they skidded by around 14 percent, weighed heavily on the U.S. corporate bond market overall. Bonds rated on a par with GE’s in the so-called triple-B range now account for roughly half of the $6 trillion investment-grade sector, and GE alone would account for 10 percent of the junk bond market should it ever lose its investment-grade rating. (GRAPHIC: GE credit spreads tighten after Danaher deal news - tmsnrt.rs/2EwZPaY) One of GE’s most active bonds on Monday, its $11.5 billion of 4.418 percent notes due in November 2035, jumped 2.6 points in price to regain the 90 cents on the dollar level for the first time since late October. In mid-November they had dropped to as low as 77 cents on the dollar. The spread of their yield over Treasuries, a measure of the additional compensation demanded by investors for holding riskier securities, narrowed to a four-month low of 222 basis points, having tightened by about 200 basis points since November. The announcement also further eased concerns about GE’s solvency that had grown markedly last year, reflected in a surge in the price for GE credit default swaps, a form of insurance against default, during the fourth quarter.

The bulk of proceeds have been pledged toward working down its debt, which at one point in late 2018 was roughly twice GE’s market capitalization as its stock price plunged to a low of $6.66 a share in December. The three main credit rating agencies - Moody’s Investors Service, S&P Global Markets and Fitch Ratings - peg GE debt at just three notches above junk bond levels. For much of the fourth quarter of 2018, its bonds were trading as though they were no longer investment-grade securities. GE bonds’ broad underperformance last year, when they skidded by around 14 percent, weighed heavily on the U.S. corporate bond market overall. Bonds rated on a par with GE’s in the so-called triple-B range now account for roughly half of the $6 trillion investment-grade sector, and GE alone would account for 10 percent of the junk bond market should it ever lose its investment-grade rating. One of GE’s most active bonds on Monday, its $11.5 billion of 4.418 percent notes due in November 2035, jumped 2.6 points in price to regain the 90 cents on the dollar level for the first time since late October. In mid-November they had dropped to as low as 77 cents on the dollar. The spread of their yield over Treasuries, a measure of the additional compensation demanded by investors for holding riskier securities, narrowed to a four-month low of 222 basis points, having tightened by about 200 basis points since November. The announcement also further eased concerns about GE’s solvency that had grown markedly last year, reflected in a surge in the price for GE credit default swaps, a form of insurance against default, during the fourth quarter. On Monday, however, GE’s CDS prices sank to their lowest since mid-October."

-2.5797188975852943," Danaher's dental spinoff plan, profit beat push shares higher (Reuters) - Danaher Corp DHR.N said on Thursday it would spin off its dental unit into a publicly traded company, as the medical equipment maker seeks to revitalize a struggling business. The company’s shares rose about 6 percent to $104.86 in premarket trading, after the company also reported better-than-expected quarterly profit for the second quarter. The unit, which provides dental tools such as prosthetics, infection prevention products and implants, has missed analysts’ expectations in the past four quarters, according to Thomson Reuters data. “The Dental business has struggled for several years, delivering low growth, and management has faced questions over its place in the portfolio for some time,” Barclays analyst Julian Mitchell said in a note. Danaher executives also hinted at more opportunity for mergers and acquisitions for the unit, highlighting a “greater focus around both organic and inorganic investment opportunities” as a standalone company. The unit, which had annual sales of nearly $3 billion in 2017, competes with Dentsply Sirona XRAY.O and 3M Co MMM.N. In 2015, Danaher off its unit, which makes test and measurement products, retail fuel pumps and telematics and automation products, into Fortive Corp FTV.N. Thursday’s move is similar to the Fortive spinoff, said Evercore ISI analyst Ross Muken, who said that the unit was spun out when it seemed to be underperforming. The dental unit spinoff will be tax-free to Danaher shareholders and is expected to be completed in the second half of 2019. Amir Aghdaei, who is currently responsible for the dental business, will become the CEO of the new company, Danaher said. Revenue rose 10.4 percent to $4.98 billion in the second quarter, above analysts’ estimates of $4.92 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Excluding items, the company reported profit of $1.15 per share, above analyst expectations of 95 cents per share. The company reported annual sales of $18.33 billion for 2017."
