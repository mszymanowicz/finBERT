-12.926260654789482," Banks help FTSE 100 up, RPC soars on private equity interest (For a live blog on European stocks, type LIVE/ in an Eikon news window) * FTSE 100 up 0.2 pct * RPC soars 20 percent on private equity takeover interest * Banks boosted by Italy budget relief * Debenhams sinks 14 pct on restructuring LONDON, Sept 10 (Reuters) - British shares edged up on Monday after relief about Italy’s budget preparations supported stocks across Europe, with banks the biggest gainers, while mid-cap packaging company RPC surged on news of takeover talks with private equity firms. The FTSE 100 was 0.2 percent higher by 1017 GMT, starting the week on a stronger footing after having hit a near five-month low on Friday. Investors’ increasing optimism that the Italian government’s 2019 budget will respect EU fiscal rules pushed up the banks index across Europe, and British banks Barclays and Lloyds fared particularly well. Packaging firm RPC was top of the FTSE 250 and STOXX 600 indices, soaring 20.8 percent after the company said it is in talks on a possible sale to Apollo Global Management and Bain Capital. The announcement came “with the important caveat that neither of these approaches might result in an offer,” said Peel Hunt analysts. “The next month will be pivotal for RPC,” they added. “If there is no bid, the bears will take hold, while if there is a bid we expect it to come at a healthy premium to Friday’s close of 684p.” AB Foods shares fell 1.8 percent after the Primark owner maintained its full-year guidance but like-for-like sales declined more than expected. “A mixed trading update from ABF, with 2018 outlook being held, but more modest commentary from the company on 2019,” said Berenberg analysts. “This was not wholly unexpected given FX movements and commodity sugar price weakness, but another year of modest space expansion at Primark is disappointing,” they added. In the small-cap space department store operator Debenhams suffered a sharp fall, while the small-cap index was down 0.3 percent overall. Weekend reports that management has called in KPMG to advise the company on its options sent Debenhams shares plunging down 15 percent to their lowest ever level. “...given the weakness in the share price and the recent acquisition of House of Fraser, we must consider the possibility that Mike Ashley’s Sports Direct - which has a near 30 percent stake in Debenhams - will swoop,” said Neil Wilson, analyst at markets.com.

-11.831649503378571," UPDATE 1-Miners help British stocks outperform; packager RPC sinks * FTSE 100 up 0.3 percent * Miners drive strongest gains * Smurfit rises as U.S. rival drops bid * RPC looking to sell assets, stock tumbles (Updates prices, adds details, quotes) By Danilo Masoni and Helen Reid MILAN/LONDON, June 6 (Reuters) - Gains among mining stocks on stronger metal prices helped British shares outperform a sluggish European equity market on Wednesday, while packaging firm RPC sold off sharply after updating investors on its spending plans. The commodity-heavy FTSE 100 index rose 0.3 percent and mid caps climbed 0.6 percent. The pan-European STOXX 600 index ended flat. Miners provided the biggest uplift to the FTSE as base metal prices rose, with copper and lead gaining ground on prospects of a supply squeeze. Anglo American, Rio Tinto and Antofagasta all rose more than 3 percent, while BHP Billiton gained 2.5 percent on reports the Anglo-Australian miner had received first bids for its U.S. shale business. Among mid-caps, RPC tumbled 11.9 percent after the plastic packager announced an increase in investments to take advantage of strong demand in China. Analysts said the investment plans had dented the firm’s cash flow figures. “RPC saw organic growth, although in the face of rising prices and a currency tailwind we think free cash flow looks low,” said Paul Moran, head of research for Northern Trust Capital Markets. WH Smith was a standout gainer, up 7.5 percent, following a well-received update. “High Street total sales and LFL ... is a great performance in the context of a very challenging environment and will surprise” said Investec analysts. Smurfit Kappa, Europe’s biggest packager, began the day at the top of the FTSE as investors warmed to its prospects after U.S. rival International Paper dropped plans to make an offer for the Ireland-based group. The stock pared gains to end the session up just 0.5 percent, however. “The fundamentals of the European packaging sector are in excellent shape,” Davy analyst Barry Dixon said in a note, upgrading his earnings forecasts and price target for the stock. “Smurfit is the leading player in this market and therefore the most exposed to the positive dynamics. This, combined with the deep intrinsic value of its assets, points to significant hidden value and upside in the share,” he added. Consumer staples were a weak spot with British American Tobacco, Imperial Brands and Unilever down 1 to 1.8 percent as the dollar fell. Insurance stocks across Europe and the UK also fell following a report that U.S. Internet giant Amazon was considering extending its empire to offer home insurance. Direct Line and Aviva dropped on the report, but recovered to trade only slightly lower by the end of the session. (Reporting by Danilo Masoni Editing by Andrew Heavens and John Stonestreet)"
-11.831649503378571," Plastics packager RPC's spending plans send shares tumbling (Reuters) - European plastic packaging leader RPC RPC.L is stepping up investments to take advantage of strong demand in China, betting that its scale and technological know-how will allow it to take share from rivals even as recycling regulations bite. However, shares in RPC were set for their worst day in a decade as the investments hit free cash flow and RPC said it would spend to expand manufacturing of its products, which include bottle caps and industrial chemical containers. Full-year free cash flow fell 4 percent to 229 million pounds ($307 million), the company said on Wednesday. Capital investments of 242 million or 6 percent of revenues were above its guidance for 230 million and were also set to rise to 250 million this year. “Yes, we are investing a significant amount of capex but I think it’s in the higher added-value return,” Chief Executive Pim Vervaat told analysts on a call. “I think we can take share from less well invested and less innovative competitors.” Shares in RPC fell as much as 17 percent to a more than two-year low. By 1045 GMT they were trading down 12 percent, at the bottom of the pan-European Stoxx 600 .STOXX index and were on course for their worst day since October 2008. “The plastics industry is one in which governments and the public are newly focused, there are some questions about underlying growth,” said Paul Moran, Head of Research for Northern Trust Capital Markets, maintaining a”sell” recommendation on the stock. Packaging markets are going through upheaval after China this year stopped accepting some lower-grade materials for recycling, while tighter regulation looms in Europe and elsewhere. UK-based RPC said none of the products it makes will be restricted by a planned European Union directive or British restrictions on single use plastics, and that little immediate impact was anticipated. RPC Chairman James Pike added that customers were not moving away from plastic but were showing increasing interest in recyclable products, playing to its design strengths. Among other projects, RPC is investing 35 million pounds in a new factory in Shanghai, as Chinese demand for food and medical packaging soars, sending RPC’s sales in China up by an average of 26 percent a year since 2014/15. RPC, which has spent over $1.5 billion on acquisitions in the past two years, said it would evaluate buying opportunities, while it identified businesses for sale that do not fit its focus on high-value recyclable plastics. The businesses slated for disposal are a European automotive injection-moulding unit, its U.S. Letica food-packaging business, which is primarily paper-based, and a metal-based spirits bottle-top business. The three have a total of 209 million pounds in revenues. RPC reported a 38 percent jump in annual adjusted operating profit, in line with analysts’ expectations. RPC said it aimed to improve adjusted operating profit of its core businesses, including its recent Nordfolien acquisition, by at least 50 million pounds by 2021, and for its organic revenue to grow faster than the wider economy."
