U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman in Manhattan said the Aug. 11, 2020, wire transfers to lenders of cosmetics maker Revlon Inc (REV.N) at issue were ""final and complete transactions, not subject to revocation."" read more A spokeswoman for Citigroup said the bank strongly disagrees with this decision and intends to appeal. ""We believe we are entitled to the funds and will continue to pursue a complete recovery of them,"" the bank said. The case stemmed from an incident where Citigroup, acting as Revlon's loan agent, wired $893 million to Revlon's lenders, appearing to pay off a loan not due until 2023. Citigroup had intended to send a $7.8 million interest payment, and blamed human error for the gaffe. Some lenders returned money they were sent, but 10 asset managers including Brigade Capital Management, HPS Investment Partners and Symphony Asset Management refused, prompting Citigroup's lawsuit to recoup the estimated $501 million they received. Citigroup had argued that the lenders should return the money because they knew or should have known it made a mistake, and that Revlon could not afford the payment. read more But in a 101-page decision, following a six-day trial in December, Furman noted that the transfers matched ""to the penny"" what the lenders were owed, and said it appeared there had never been a mistake of this size before. ""The non-returning lenders believed, and were justified in believing, that the payments were intentional,"" Furman wrote. ""To believe otherwise - to believe that Citibank, one of the most sophisticated financial institutions in the world, had made a mistake that had never happened before, to the tune of nearly $1 billion - would have been borderline irrational."" Lawyers for both parties did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Administrative agents typically distribute interest payments and perform back-office services for clients such as Revlon. Industry groups have said a ruling against Citigroup could expose banks to excessive liability risks."
1.82829888712242," Citigroup urges return of mistaken Revlon payment as trial ends NEW YORK (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc made a final push on Wednesday to persuade a federal judge to force lenders of Revlon Inc to return half a billion dollars of its own money that it mistakenly sent them. At the conclusion of a six-day non-jury trial, U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman in Manhattan said he would rule as quickly as he could, while admitting “it’s not the easiest case.” The case stemmed from an Aug. 11 blunder where Citigroup, acting as Revlon’s loan agent, wired $893 million to Revlon lenders, which the struggling cosmetics company controlled by billionaire Ronald Perelman did not owe until 2023, rather than a $7.8 million interest payment. Ten asset managers including Brigade Capital Management, HPS Investment Partners and Symphony Asset Management have refused to return $501 million. Furman said he plans to consider their thinking immediately after being paid, as he decides whether there was a “discharge for value.” Such a discharge allows creditors who are owed money to keep sums they are mistakenly wired if they are unaware of a mistake. “You might expect some sort of chat or email like, ‘Whoa, can you believe it, they must have totally messed up,’” Furman said. Citigroup, the administrative agent for the 2016 loan, blamed human error for the overpayment. It said the lenders should return its money because they knew it was sent in error and Revlon couldn’t afford it. “The question is, what would have a reasonable person done under the circumstances,” Citigroup’s lawyer Christopher Houpt said. Revlon’s lenders acted “as if there was no repayment,” he said. In contrast, the defendants said they had no reason to believe Citigroup blundered. “The situation here is the exact payout of outstanding principal with accrued interest through that date,” their lawyer Adam Abensohn said. “That is quite different from hitting ‘send’ twice on the same interest payment.” Furman urged the financial services industry and regulators to adopt procedures to address similar situations. “The industry should figure out a better way of dealing with these things, even if this is a black swan event,” he said. The case is In re: Citibank August 11, 2020 Wire Transfers, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 20-06539."
1.82829888712242," Citigroup heads to trial seeking to undo nearly $900 million Revlon blunder Citigroup Inc (C.N) is heading to trial on Wednesday, hoping to convince a Manhattan federal judge to undo a nearly $900 million blunder where it used its own money to repay lenders of Revlon Inc (REV.N), the struggling cosmetics company. The unusual case could provide insight into Wall Street banks' relationships with clients, and guidance on steps that banks must take to safeguard how money is moved. It stemmed from an Aug. 11 incident where Citigroup mistakenly wired $893 million to Revlon's lenders, appearing to pay off a loan that was not due until 2023, rather than a planned $7.8 million interest payment. The bank had been acting as the loan agent for Revlon, which did not have enough cash to prepay the loan. While some 200 Revlon lenders have repaid Citigroup, the bank is suing hedge fund and asset managers such as Brigade Capital Management, HPS Investment Partners and Symphony Asset Management to recover $501 million that it said remains due. U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman will preside over the nonjury trial, which will be conducted by videoconference and may last four days. Citigroup has said the defendants did not act in good faith in keeping an overpayment they knew Revlon could not afford and which they did not even tell clients about, and which an HPS staffer called the product of a ""fat fingered"" bank employee. The bank's North American loan chief and global head of loan and risk management services are expected to testify. Revlon's lenders have countered that they had no reason to think a sophisticated international bank would pay them by mistake, and that they were simply paid a debt Revlon owed. They may also argue that they thought Revlon's billionaire controlling shareholder Ronald Perelman stepped in to bail the company out, as he had done before. Furman said on Monday the ""heart of the trial"" concerns whether there was a ""discharge for value"" entitling lenders to keep Citigroup's money.

-12.05392545598731," UPDATE 1-Citigroup defends actions at trial over $900 million Revlon blunder (Adds testimony from trial) NEW YORK, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc went to trial on Wednesday to try to recoup a half-billion dollars it claims is still due after it accidentally used nearly $900 million of its own money to repay lenders of Revlon Inc, the struggling cosmetics company. The unusual case in Manhattan federal court could provide insight into Wall Street banks’ relationships with clients, and the steps that banks must take to safeguard how money is moved. It stemmed from an Aug. 11 incident where the bank’s Citibank unit, acting as Revlon’s loan agent, wired $893 million to Revlon’s lenders rather than a planned $7.8 million interest payment, appearing to pay off a loan not due until 2023. While some 200 Revlon lenders have repaid Citigroup, the bank wants hedge fund and asset managers including Brigade Capital Management, HPS Investment Partners and Symphony Asset Management to return the remaining $501 million. They claim they were simply paid what they were owed. Citigroup has said the lenders did not receive a prepayment notice, and Vincent Farrell, Citibank’s North American loan chief, testified it would be “extremely uncommon” not to send one if the bank intended a full repayment of loan principal. Under questioning from the lenders’ lawyer Adam Abensohn, Farrell agreed that the overpayment was “human error,” but was challenged on whether internal communications showed bank employees thought otherwise, or whether anyone was disciplined. He was also asked whether Citigroup was “holding off” on firing a loan manager involved in the overpayment until after the trial. “I don’t know,” Farrell responded. Revlon’s lenders have said they had no reason to think Citigroup made a mistake. Some have also claimed they thought Revlon’s billionaire controlling shareholder Ronald Perelman stepped in to bail the company out, as he had done before. U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman is overseeing the nonjury trial by videoconference. It may last four days. A key issue is whether there was a “discharge for value” entitling lenders to keep Citigroup’s money.

-21.744791666666664," Citigroup on track for trial over $900 million Revlon mistake NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Thursday said Citigroup Inc’s lawsuit to recoup some of the nearly $900 million it mistakenly paid Revlon Inc’s lenders appeared on track for trial next week after receiving assurances he had authority to conduct it. U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman in Manhattan had late Wednesday said he could not be sure all the defendants were citizens of different states than the bank’s South Dakota-based Citibank unit, a jurisdictional requirement for the planned Dec. 9 nonjury trial. But at a hearing, lawyers for Citigroup and the defendants said they were making substantial progress on that issue, and confident at least most defendants could stay in the case. “I’m relieved in that it seems like it won’t blow up the trial on this issue,” Furman said. The lawsuit stemmed from Citigroup’s having on Aug. 11 sent $893 million of its own money, rather than a $7.8 million interest payment, to Revlon’s lenders. Citigroup was acting as the loan agent for the struggling cosmetics company, which lacked sufficient cash to fully repay the loan, which was due in 2023. The bank blamed human error for the blunder, and said the defendants knew the payment was a mistake but have nonetheless refused to return $508 million. It said about 200 lenders have returned the remaining $385 million. But the defendants, including Brigade Capital Management and HPS Investment Partners, said they were not obligated to return money Revlon owed, and had no reason to believe a global bank such as Citigroup would transfer the full amount by accident. Some defendants also said they thought Revlon’s controlling shareholder, billionaire Ronald Perelman, would never let Revlon fail, and might have stepped in to bail the company out as he had done before. A trial is expected to last four days. The case is In re: Citibank August 11, 2020 Wire Transfers, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 20-06539."
30.877573131094255," Breakingviews - Revlon may take shareholder rights full circle NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - On Wall Street, Revlon means more than a two-bit makeup company. A 1980s lawsuit involving the sale of the New York firm controlled by billionaire Ron Perelman ushered in the so-called “Revlon Rule,” a corporate finance case study for decades on the responsibilities of boards to shareholders. After narrowly avoiding bankruptcy last week, some 24 years on, the $500 million company is at a crossroads. Its last chapter likely ends with a deal of its own. Perelman, who owns almost 90% of Revlon through MacAndrews & Forbes, took control of Revlon after his then-company Pantry Pride launched a hostile takeover. Revlon’s board tried to thwart his offer by finding a friendlier suitor. A Delaware court ruled that the company’s board was at the mercy of shareholders. In an all-cash, change-of-control transaction, boards must run a process designed to maximize shareholder value. Rows between shareholders and other stakeholders have since taken on a life of their own. What’s ironic is that Revlon’s investors haven’t much benefitted from shareholder maximization. Battered by an industry overcome by influencers like Kylie Jenner, Revlon’s sales fell in both 2018 and 2019. Then Covid-19 hit. Masks kept people from applying Super Lustrous Lipstick while lockdowns hurt other beautifying habits. In the past three years Revlon’s equity value has fallen almost 60% while Estee Lauder more than doubled. Revlon could trudge through a turnaround, but there’s no guarantee lockdowns and mandated mask-wearing eases up anytime soon. And Perelman’s presence hasn’t done much – Revlon’s equity is worth less than when he originally bought the company. The recent restructuring of bonds that contribute to more than $3.5 billion of debt is only a Band-Aid. But it may have lifted a hurdle to a sale. With a scrubbed balance sheet, Revlon could shine itself up for an auction. Lauder might even be a buyer. The $93 billion company has less than $5 billion in debt, about 1.5 times Refinitiv’s estimated EBITDA for the year ended in June 2021. If it paid a 25% premium, it could make a return of 8%, assuming Revlon’s operating income returns to 2019 levels. Vector in cost cuts of just 5% of Revlon’s overhead expenses and the return doubles. That would be one way to put lipstick on a venerable pig."
-7.903494176372707," Revlon avoids bankruptcy after getting bondholder support Nov 12 (Reuters) - Revlon Inc said on Thursday that enough bondholders had taken part in its debt restructuring program for the cosmetics maker to stave off bankruptcy. The company had warned earlier this month that it may be forced to file for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection if a certain amount of its bonds worth $342.8 million were still outstanding by mid-November, as it would trigger the accelerated repayment of other debts. Holders of about $236 million, or 68.8%, of the company’s outstanding bonds that mature in February had been tendered into an exchange offer by the end of Tuesday, Revlon said on Thursday. Revlon offered holders either up to 32.5 cents on the dollar in cash for their bonds, or a combination of cash and new debt. “The Company does not expect that any bankruptcy or insolvency proceeding will be necessary,” it said in a statement."

The third-largest U.S. bank has dismissed all charges against Investcorp Credit Management LLC, which it said had received $18.9 million from Citi’s accidental payment. “We are pleased to have these funds returned,” said Citigroup in a statement. Citi had sued a dozen firms for refusing to return the payment after an “operational error” caused the bank to transfer $900 million of its own funds to Revlon creditors, a blunder that led to costly litigation, regulatory consent orders and a $400-million penalty. Since then, Citi has announced that Chief Executive Mike Corbat would retire earlier than expected, with current president Jane Fraser set to succeed him."
69.85871271585557," Citigroup's Corbat faces tense analyst questions as he approaches exit (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc’s outgoing chief executive came under fire on Tuesday for mistakes that have led to regulatory penalties during a conference call to discuss quarterly results, with analysts questioning his pay and why he is not leaving immediately. In unusually direct exchanges, analysts pressed Chief Executive Mike Corbat to explain what management is doing to fix technical and operational problems that have plagued Citigroup for years and led the bank to erroneously send $900 million of its own funds to Revlon creditors in August. That blunder led to costly litigation between Citigroup and the recipients, as well as regulatory consent orders, a $400-million penalty and lots of embarrassment. Last month, Citigroup announced that Corbat would retire earlier than expected, to be replaced in February by Jane Fraser. Several analysts asked why Corbat did not make more progress in overhauling creaky technology or generating better returns for shareholders during his tenure. They also criticized what they described as a lack of accountability, noting that executive compensation should be better tied to risk management and shareholder returns. “Where is the sense of urgency?” Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo asked Corbat. “Why not step aside now?” Corbat described steps Citigroup is taking to repair issues identified by the Federal Reserve and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and defended the progress Citigroup has made since he took charge. When asked how much the overhaul might ultimately cost, Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason said it would be “hard to pinpoint a number” beyond the $1 billion Citigroup is spending this year. Citigroup shares fell 5% to $43.58 in afternoon trading. Earlier in the day, Citigroup detailed a 34% decline in third-quarter profit as the coronavirus recession hurt its consumer bank. Its net income of $3.2 billion, or $1.40 per share, still topped analyst expectations of 93 cents per share. But the results were weaker than crosstown rival JPMorgan Chase & Co, whose quarterly profit rose, and Citigroup’s management offered a bleaker outlook. “We are expecting a somewhat more muted and slower recovery in both unemployment and GDP through 2022,” Mason said. Citigroup added about $314 million to credit loss reserves in the quarter, compared to the $15 billion it had set aside in the first half of the year. Revenue in North American branded cards, the growth engine for Citi’s consumer bank going into the year, fell 12% as its credit card customers closed accounts and spent less. The bank, one of the largest credit card issuers globally, said end-of-period open accounts across its portfolio dropped by 4%, or more than 5 million, and purchase sales slid 10%. Citi’s trading business was a bright spot, with a 16% jump in revenue helping to offset consumer weakness. Fraser, who was not on the call, has said that overhauling risk management and internal controls will be her priority. Analysts will probably get a chance to engage with her on the next quarterly call, Corbat said. Regulators have curtailed Citigroup’s ability to make significant acquisitions until its operational issues are fixed. Similar problems caused Citigroup to fail or barely pass its annual stress tests in prior years. Shareholders are concerned that the consent orders and $400 million fine are only the beginning of regulatory fallout for Citigroup, said Bank of America analyst Erika Najarian. She likened the situation to scandal-plagued Wells Fargo & Co , which has faced a long series of fines, lawsuits and regulatory penalties since its phony-accounts scandal began unraveling in 2016. Corbat said the two situations were not comparable because, unlike Wells Fargo, Citigroup did not dupe customers or seek to profit from the Revlon error. Instead, it lost money. “No fraud, no customer harm, no benefit around that,” he said."

A U.S. judge blocked a hedge fund from doing anything with its nearly $175 million portion of the payout while he considers a preliminary injunction that could eventually require the firm to repay Citigroup. In a large blunder, Citigroup last week erroneously repaid a nearly $900 million loan made to Revlon, a day after lenders sued the cosmetic company over its restructuring tactics. Citi quickly caught the payment error and was taking steps to recover the funds, the bank has said. Citi had been acting as agent on the loan, meaning it collected payments from Revlon to distribute to the creditors, but the accidental payment came from the bank’s own funds. The error has drawn scrutiny from regulators who have begun looking into the loan and raised questions about the bank’s operational resiliency. The regulatory fallout of the mistake is likely to be drawn out, long time banking analyst Dick Bove from Odeon Capital Group said in a research note. “A payment error by the nation’s only truly international bank is likely to cause significant questions concerning the systems the bank is using,” he said. Brigade Capital Management LP, which got $175 million from the payment, has so far refused to give the money back. Citigroup wired the money to 43 Brigade funds because they were Revlon’s lenders, rather than Brigade itself. “To target Brigade as if they were the lender here, it just doesn’t work and it doesn’t make sense with respect to the type of relief they’re seeking,” said Robert Loigman, a lawyer representing Brigade. An attorney for Citigroup asserted that as manager of the funds, Brigade has the power to return the money to the bank, and that if a judge rules the hedge fund can keep the funds it would create dangerous precedent. “We think it creates serious issues for the banking industry If players like Brigade can understand, by all accounts, that this was unintentional, that this was a mistake, and can reap a windfall from it,” said Matthew Ingber, who represents Citi."
