14.115569704313424," Casino's first quarter sales growth accelerates, boosted by food demand in France PARIS, April 23 (Reuters) - Retailer Casino, battling investor concerns over its high debt, said revenue growth accelerated in the first-quarter, reflecting strong food sales in its core French market amid the coronavirus epidemic, and a robust performance in Brazil. Casino, which last month suspended its financial guidance for 2020 due to uncertainties tied to the coronavirus pandemic, said the lockdown in place in France since March 17 led to “unprecedented” food demand notably at its convenience stores and in e-commerce. Casino, which has been selling assets to reduce its debt and which also controls Brazil’s Grupo Pao de Acucar, posted first-quarter sales of 8.294 billion euros ($8.97 billion).

-35.83984222346118," Brazil's GPA sees wholesale chain Assaí sales hitting $12 billion by 2022 SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil's GPA PCAR4.SA sees its wholesale unit Assaí reaching 50 billion reais ($11.91 billion) in gross sales by the end of 2022 from expected 30 billion reais this year, as the food retailer continues to organically expand its operations, its chief executive said on Wednesday. The local subsidiary of France's Casino Guichard Perrachon SA CASP.PA plans to open 20 new Assaí stores per year in Brazil until 2021 and to bring the wholesale chain to Colombia as early as next year. “It will be our first Assaí store outside Brazil,” CEO Peter Estermann told journalists in a press conference before a meeting with investors in Sao Paulo. He added Colombia’s first Assaí store will have around 5,000 square meters (54,000 square feet) and will be well positioned to compete with other hard-discount players in that market. The move comes after GPA successfully concluded a tender offer to acquire shares of Colombian retailer Almacenes Exito SA IMI.CN, as part of broader efforts by parent company Casino to simplify its shareholding structure in Latin America. Estermann noted GPA will incorporate Exito’s results into its own earnings as early as next year, which should boost the company’s net income, gross sales and Ebitda in 2020. “We will become a company with over 70 billion reais in gross revenue and 150,000 employees in South America,” he said. In Brazil, GPA should keep the pace of Assaí’s organic expansion, while resuming conversions of Extra hypermarkets into this wholesale format. The group currently has over 100 hypermarkets in the country, out of which 25 have potential to become Assaí stores between 2020 and 2021, the CEO added. Estermann said GPA will also resume the expansion of its Pão de Açúcar chain, opening 10 new supermarkets and 50 new convenience stores under the brand Minuto Pão de Açúcar. “In the last five years we have accelerated the expansion of Assaí while keeping a more defensive position in other brands to adjust our store portfolio and improve profitability... Now we are ready to expand Pão de Açúcar again,” he explained. GPA still expects to conclude a two-year conversion of 178 Extra supermarkets into Mercado Extra and Compre Bem stores by the end of June 2020. “Then, we may start considering ways to organically expand Compre Bem as of the second half,” Estermann said. For its e-commerce, the company expects sales to double in 2020, helped by the addition of third-party sellers to the platform in the first half, surpassing a growth of over 40% in 2019, according to GPA’s Chief Digital Officer Jorge Faiçal."

The local subsidiary of France’s Casino Guichard Perrachon SA currently offers its customers over 2,000 in-house products from various categories, representing approximately 13% of total sales, according to its most recent earnings report. GPA’s launch of its “Fábrica 1959” beer brand comes amid growing consumer interest in craft beers around the world. “We sell almost 20 million bottles of craft beer per year, and it’s a market with high growth potential, as consumers increasingly migrate from mainstream brands,” GPA’s director of exclusive brands, Samir Jarrouj, told Reuters in an interview. The company expects its Fábrica 1959 brand to represent 25% of all craft beer sales by the end of 2020, he said. More than 600 Extra and Pão de Açúcar stores across Brazil will sell Fabrica 1959, as well as GPA’s e-commerce platforms. Jarrouj declined to reveal how much GPA is investing in the beer and other in-house products. The retailer started its craft beer project more than two years ago, when it teamed up with the Imigração brewery and the Brazilian Beer Institute to develop its own recipes for Pilsen, Witbier, Weiss and India Pale Ale, Jarrouj said.

GPA’s shares edged down 0.4% to 82.73 reais, trimming gains so far this year to around 3%. The company late Wednesday reported a 30% rise in third-quarter net income from a year ago, helped by cost-cutting and sales growth led mostly by its wholesale unit Assaí. BTG Pactual analysts called GPA’s overall performance “soft,” noting that its multivarejo division, with the Extra, Compre Bem and Pão de Açúcar brands, remains under pressure. “Although we see a better trend for the company in the fourth quarter, both top line and margin-wise, given the brighter economic outlook, the recovery should be only gradual in its fundamentals,” they wrote in a report. Estermann said GPA will accelerate supermarket conversions and store renovations in the coming months to meet growing consumer demand. For the fourth quarter, GPA plans to renovate 20 Pão de Açúcar stores, and convert 18 supermarkets to Mercado Extra and 15 to Compre Bem, Estermann said. The company is also building 14 new Assaí stores in 12 Brazilian states, of which 11 will be opened by December and three early next year. For 2020, GPA sees the potential to convert some hypermarkets to Assaí wholesale stores, he added. “Especially in Sao Paulo, where some Assaí stores cannot be expanded, we consider a possible conversion of hypermarkets next year,” Estermann said.

-20.574464280431457," France's Casino to overhaul Latam holdings, GPA shares soar SAO PAULO/PARIS (Reuters) - Casino Guichard Perrachon CASP.PA on Thursday unveiled a plan to simplify the complex shareholding structure for its Latin American operations, sending shares in its Brazilian and Colombian units soaring. The restructuring would result in Casino controlling its Latin American business in Brazil, Colombia, Uruguay and Argentina through a 41.4% stake in Brazilian unit Grupo Pao de Acucar (GPA) PCAR4.SA. Casino, which has been grappling with high debt, has been trying to address investor criticism over the complex and sometimes opaque structure of its business. Casino’s Chief Financial Officer David Lubek told Reuters the move would “help improve the value of the Latin American assets.” This could thus make it easier for Casino to later sell GPA shares to investors, added analysts. Latin America, and particularly Brazil, is a key contributor to Casino’s sales and profit, helping offset weaker performance in France where the retailing group has faced price wars among supermarket companies. Last month Casino's parent companies including Rallye GENC.PA were placed under protection from creditors in an effort to save the indebted French group from collapse. GPA will use cash to acquire all shares in Almacenes Exito with a potential purchase price of 16,000 to 18,000 Colombian pesos ($5.03 to $5.66) per share. Casino would acquire all controlling shares in GPA indirectly owned by Exito. By 1437 GMT, Casino shares were up 4.7% as investors welcomed the long-awaited move, which Jefferies analysts said “could allow the French group a greater monetization of the re-rated equity” and “help the deleverage process.” GPA’s shares would migrate to the Novo Mercado segment of Brazil’s stock exchange as part of the overhaul, a move that requires it to comply with stricter governance standards. GPA's shares soared 10.5% on the Sao Paulo stock exchange while those of Colombia's Almacenes Exito SA IMI.CN were up more than 12% after the proposal by GPA to buy out its shareholders. Analysts at BTG Pactual said the new structure “improves corporate governance” for GPA. Bradesco BBI analysts raised their target price for GPA from 110 to 112 reais, saying the migration to the Novo Mercado segment may increase earnings per share by 11% through next year. Earlier this month, GPA sold its 36% stake in Brazilian appliance and electronics seller Via Varejo VVAR3.SA in an auction, raising 2.3 billion reais ($598 million). Investors have long lamented the complexity of various holding company structures set up by Casino Chairman and CEO Jean-Charles Naouri and have urged him to simplify them. In 2015, short-seller Muddy Waters criticized Casino’s structure and accounting practices, saying it was “dangerously leveraged” and managed for the short-term. Casino has consistently rejected Muddy Waters’ accusations. French market regulator AMF launched a probe into the criticism in early 2016 and the investigation, which is looking into both Casino and Muddy Waters, is expected to reach a conclusion soon. Muddy Waters has already rejected the preliminary findings of the AMF probe after Le Monde newspaper said the regulator suspected Muddy Waters of “deception” regarding Casino, whose shares have been hurt by Muddy Waters’ comments. On Thursday, French paper Les Echos said the AMF preliminary report also criticized Casino’s financial communication. Casino said it would not comment on an “ongoing procedure” An AMF spokeswoman said on Thursday that the regulator regretted “the release in the press of elements that are presented as being part of the investigation, a release which hurts the measured process of the investigation procedure.”"

GPA SA, Brazil’s No.2 retailer and the biggest unit of Casino Guichard Perrachon SA outside of France, will sell its 36% stake in appliance and furniture retailer Via Varejo SA at a maximum 5% discount to Tuesday’s closing price, according to a filing. GPA shares surged nearly 3% in Sao Paulo trading as investors cheered the move to finally unload the loss-making appliance unit, which it had struggled to sell since 2016. In the same Wednesday filing, Via Varejo said its second-largest shareholder, retail veteran Michael Klein, agreed to pay up to 4.75 reais per share at auction, the same 5% discounted price that GPA accepted. Klein has recruited about eight stock funds to participate in the auction, according to a person familiar with the talks. He is ready to contribute between 500 million reais and 800 million reais, said the source, requesting anonymity because the negotiations are confidential. Analysts at Itau BBA said the deal would help GPA focus on food and get a market valuation more in line with its peers. “For Via Varejo, given the extremely challenging scenario that the company has been facing from an operating perspective, we believe that a change in the controlling group will open a window for a potential turnaround process,” the analysts wrote in a note to clients. Sao Paulo stock exchange operator B3 said the auction of Via Varejo shares would be held on Friday. Via Varejo shares fell 2.6% on Wednesday to 4.87 reais, approaching the maximum discount accepted by GPA."

Casino, which controls Brazilian retailer Grupo Pao de Acucar (GPA), issued a statement after Brazilian paper 0 Globo said the French firm could announce “in the next few days” a plan to combine its assets in Latin America. Citing reports about plans in Latin America, Casino said “it studies its various strategic options in this region in the context of the permanent review of its investments.” “These thoughts have not led to any material element that would justify a disclosure to the market,” it added. Casino also owns wholesale chain Assai and electronics and appliance retailer Via Varejo in Brazil, and supermarket chain Grupo Exito in Colombia, Argentina, Uruguay and Chile. Latin America, and particularly Brazil, is a key contributor to Casino’s sales and profits, and has helped offset a weaker performance in France, where Casino has faced price wars among supermarket companies. Casino had retail sales of 15.6 billion euros ($17.4 billion) in Latin America in 2018, or 42.5 percent of overall group sales. The region’s operating profit was 644 million, or 53 percent of group profit. The robust performance of Brazil, Casino’s second largest market after France, has been largely driven by the Assai Cash and Carry stores, as Brazil emerges from a recession. Brazil’s GPA holds a 36.3 percent stake in Via Varejo, a business it has been trying to sell since November 2016. Peter Estermann, who serves as chief executive officer of both companies in Brazil, said Casino’s shift in Latam should not affect plans to sell GPA’s stake in Via Varejo. “We’re following the same strategy and our focus is still finding a strategic buyer for Via Varejo by the end of this year”, Estermann told analysts on a call to discuss GPA’s earnings. Banco Santander Brazil said in a note that Casino could seek to swap some of its 55 percent stake in Exito for GPA shares in Via Varejo. That would allow Casino “to have a larger proportion of Via Varejo’s sale.” According to Santander, GPA’s current stake in Via Varejo was valued around 450 million euros. In a securities filing last week, Via Varejo said its board has urged shareholders to remove a clause in its bylaws demanding a tender offer to all shareholders if an investor buys a stake equal to or larger than 20 percent. Via Varejo said the change in the clause, usually viewed as a defense against takeovers, would be “positive” for the company. On Wednesday, GPA reported a double-digit drop in first-quarter net consolidated income, missing analysts’ estimates and triggering heavy losses in shares. The stock dropped 6 percent at 82.45 reais on Thursday. Casino shares ended down 2.6 percent on Thursday, giving the company a market capitalization of less than 4 billion euros.

GPA, which is owned by France’s Casino Guichard Perrachon SA, reported gross revenues of 13.8 billion reais ($3.46 billion), driven by gains in its wholesale division, Assaí. On Tuesday, Carrefour Brasil posted a 10 percent increase in gross sales to 14.2 billion reais, as growth in its wholesale unit Atacadão more than compensated for a flat performance in the retail division. In recent quarters, the wholesale format - where consumers can buy discounted goods directly in a warehouse setting - has gained popularity amid the slow recovery of the Brazilian economy from the worst recession in decades. Atacadão leads the segment in sales but faces increasing competition from new players, as well as Assaí. Assaí total sales grew by 26 percent in the first three months of 2019, as a result of an expansion plan to open 20 new stores per year.

-2.14536102853609," UPDATE 1-Brazil's GPA eyes aggressive expansion, new initiatives for rest of 2018 (Adds information throughout on initiatives at various GPA banners) SAO PAULO, July 25 (Reuters) - GPA, one of Brazil’s largest food retailers, will open 13 stores under its recently re-launched Compre Bem brand by the end of August and speed up an expansion of its wholesale-style Assai banner in the second half of 2018, executives said on Wednesday. Compre Bem, a food retail chain that emphasizes regional flair to compete with smaller market incumbents, was purchased in 2003 but discontinued in 2011. With the relaunch, GPA, owned by France’s Casino Guichard Perrachon SA, will be seeking to penetrate various parts of the country with well-positioned regional rivals. The moves underscore how GPA is eager to expand as the food retail sector picks up steam. It also illustrates how Chief Executive Peter Estermann and his team, installed in April, are quickly making their mark on the food retailer, the second largest in Brazil after Carrefour’s local unit . “We’re going to evaluate a pilot of 13 Compre Bem stores, and in the first quarter of next year we’ll have some more consistent information,” Estermann told analysts in a call following the company’s second quarter results release. GPA also plans to renovate 10 stores under its traditional Extra banner by the end of August and has picked out another 32 stores to modify to appeal to a more upscale audience. The company is currently building or converting stores under other GPA banners into 14 new Assai stores that will total 70,000 square meters in retail area when completed, the executives said. On the call, GPA Co-Vice Chairman Ronaldo Iabrudi said the recent migration of electronics retailer Via Varejo SA to the Novo Mercado segment of Brazil’s main stock exchange will help GPA sell the unit. Iabrudi added that GPA itself was not considering moving to the Novo Mercado, which has higher corporate governance standards than the rest of the exchange and demands that companies have only common shares. GPA first put Via Varejo up for sale in 2016, but the company’s traditional brick-and-mortar formats have attracted only sporadic interest.

-2.14536102853609," UPDATE 2-Brazil's GPA benefits from tax change; adjusted profit hits estimates (Adds figures on profit, revenue, and expenses) SAO PAULO, July 24 (Reuters) - GPA, one of Brazil’s largest food retailers, reported quarterly results that soared past profit estimates on Tuesday due to significant tax re-calculations. In a securities filing, GPA, owned by France’s Casino Guichard Perrachon SA, posted second-quarter net income of 526 million reais ($140 million), up over 350 percent from the same period a year ago, and well above the Reuters consensus estimate of 150 million reais. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (Ebitda) also smashed estimates, coming in at 972 million reais, well above the consensus estimate of 535 million reais. Compensating for the tax adjustment, the company said it would have posted Ebitda of 648 million reais and a net income of 153 million reais, above and in line with estimates, respectively. Earlier this year, Brazil’s Supreme Court overturned a controversial accounting principle in which retailers were effectively double-taxed. Non-recurring one-time savings resulting from the ruling resulted in a benefit of some 369 million reais for GPA’s wholesale-style Assai format, and approximately 50 million for the firm’s more traditional Multivarejo format. In the quarter, GPA reported strong profit growth in its Assai and Multivarejo divisions, as expected, with both formats reversing losses from the same period last year. While the company was able to reduce spending at Multivarejo by 2.7 percent as a percentage of net revenue, that number remained steady at Assai, which could indicate the company is reaching its limits in terms of cost savings in a division whose success is based on low overhead. In previously disclosed figures, an 11-day truckers’ strike in May knocked 0.7 percent off quarterly net revenue. (Reporting by Gram Slattery Editing by Leslie Adler)"

In a securities filing, GPA, owned by France’s Casino Guichard Perrachon SA, posted second-quarter net income of 526 million reais ($140 million), up over 350 percent from the same period a year ago, and well above a Reuters consensus estimate of 150 million reais.

5.049657718735108," UPDATE 1-Brazil's Via Varejo to unify all stock classes while sale process continues (Adds GPA co-vice chairman quotes, background) SAO PAULO, July 23 (Reuters) - Via Varejo, the appliance retailing arm of Brazilian retailer GPA SA, will convert all its shares into a single class of common stock, the company said in a securities filing on Monday. The co-vice chairman of GPA, Ronaldo Iabrudi, said in a phone interview late on Monday that all preferred shares would be converted into common shares using a 1:1 ratio. Owners of units, a bundle of two preferred and one common share that is Via Varejo’s most widely traded stock class, would receive three common shares, Iabrudi added. GPA SA, which is controlled by France’s Casino Guichard Perrachon SA, has been trying to sell its appliance retailing unit for more than a year. A deep downturn in Brazil’s economy has weighed on the sale process. After the share conversion, GPA, which now holds 62.5 percent of Via Varejo’s voting stock, will have a 43.3 percent stake in the company, according to Iabrudi. Via Varejo was classified as an asset for potential divestment when GPA announced its intention to sell the controlling stake. After the stock conversion, Via Varejo will be listed in Novo Mercado, a segment in Brazil’s stock exchange with strengthened governance standards. Iabrudi pointed to other companies that did similar reorganizations, such as miner Vale SA, saying he expected Via Varejo’s shares to gain liquidity. By mid-August, Via Varejo will schedule a shareholders meeting within 30 days to approve the share conversion. The co-vice chairman said the second largest shareholder in Via Varejo after GPA, the Klein family, which holds a 25 percent stake, was also supporting the conversion to a single class of stock. GPA will not change the members of Via Varejo’s board, he added. The transaction will not affect the sale process of the appliance and electronics unit, Iabrudi said. “It’s natural that potential buyers are cautious about acquiring such a big asset, during an electoral period with a lot of uncertainty,” he added, declining to elaborate on a time frame for a deal.

6.156916419866832," UPDATE 2-Strong quarterly revenue boosts shares of Brazil retailer GPA (Adds details of results, background, analyst note, share reaction) SAO PAULO/BRASILIA, July 13 (Reuters) - Brazil’s GPA reported strong quarterly revenue growth on Friday, as robust sales in its wholesale stores offset the negative impact of a major truckers’ strike, sending shares up almost 5 percent in midday trading. The company, owned by France’s Casino Guichard Perrachon SA , said revenue climbed 10.4 percent from a year ago in the second quarter to 11.775 billion reais ($3 billion), driven by growth in its wholesale Assai stores. The figure was just below the mean estimate of analysts polled by Reuters for 12.2 billion reais. Investors cheered the news, sending up GPA shares by 4.7 percent in midday trading in Sao Paulo, their biggest intraday gain since February. Brazil’s benchmark Bovespa index was up about 0.6 percent. Same-store sales, a gauge of sales at stores open for at least 12 months, grew 5.4 percent in the quarter through June. The performance shows how loyalty programs and other incentives, a shakeup in store formats, and improved consumer confidence continue to carry the food retailer despite macroeconomic headwinds in Brazil. It also indicates that GPA’s results are on track following a management shakeup that took effect in April. A nationwide protest by truckers in May, which rattled Latin America’s largest economy, had a negative impact on total revenue of 0.7 percent, with the Assai division harder hit than more traditional formats, the company said. Still, same-store sales at the Assai wholesale division climbed 4.7 percent, while sales at the company’s more traditional Multivarejo stores climbed 5.8 percent. GPA opened 20 new Assai stores over the past year, amid the growing popularity in Brazil of big box stores making high-volume sales to smaller retailers and thrifty consumers. Within the Multivarejo division, the company’s flagship Pao de Acucar brand was the top performer, with same store sales climbing some 7.9 percent. The company attributed growth in the Multivarejo division in part to the continued rollout of loyalty programs and efforts to boost online sales since GPA shook up management. In a note to clients, Sao Paulo brokerage Coinvalores called the results “positive,” pointing in particular to market share gains for some of the firm’s Multivarejo formats. Holidays and one-time events also had some effect, including a boost in shopping ahead of the soccer World Cup tournament and an earlier Easter that moved much of the shopping for that holiday into the first quarter of 2018. Shares in parent company Casino were up 0.8 percent."
