8.038827483480423," Estee Lauder posts surprise revenue growth on China demand, shares soar (Reuters) - Estee Lauder Cos Inc on Friday reported a surprise rise in quarterly sales and handily beat profit estimates on strong demand for premium skin-care products and fragrances in China, lifting its shares to a record high. Shares of New York-based Estee, whose skin-care segment grew 28% on higher demand for its La Mer and Clinique labels, were last up 8.8%. A sustained strong demand for serums and moisturizers from customers keeping up their self-care routine has helped Estee cushion the pandemic-induced impact of weak demand for traditional make-up items such as foundation and lipsticks. “The consumers are always more and more enthusiastic for skin care... We assume the skin care strength will continue after COVID-19,” Chief Executive Officer Fabrizio Freda said. Sales in its Asia-Pacific market rose 35% in the quarter, boosted by robust demand during Tmall’s Singles’ Day shopping event in China, helping Estee post its first growth in overall revenue since the onset of the pandemic. Concerns about tempered sales due to broader and more stringent lockdowns than anticipated and cannibalization of Chinese domestic travel retail by a strong Singles’ Day period proved misplaced, Barclays analyst Lauren Lieberman said. Estee said it planned to resume its share buyback program during the second half of the fiscal year, as the company’s cost-cutting measures, including controlling its advertising and promotional expenses, paid off. Excluding items, Estee earned $2.61 per share in the second quarter, far exceeding analysts’ estimate of $1.69. Net sales rose 5% to $4.85 billion, also beating a Refinitiv IBES estimate of $4.49 billion. Estee, however, forecast third-quarter net sales to grow between 13% and 14%, lower than estimates of 15.3% growth, as its makeup sales drag."

10.5164891130299," Estee Lauder results beat on online, Asia strength (Reuters) - Estee Lauder Cos Inc EL.N reported better-than-expected quarterly results on Monday, as people confined to their homes bought more of its skincare products online and sales improved in its Asian markets. The M.A.C brand owner has ramped up investments in its online business and seen growth in demand for its skincare products as customers opted for serums and moisturizers instead of make-up items during the COVID-19 pandemic. “Before, online was mainly the destination of younger people. Now it’s for everyone. Everyone is online,” Chief Executive Officer Fabrizio Freda told analysts on a call. The company’s shares rose as much as 8.3% to a record high on Monday as online sales soared 40% in the first quarter. Its sales in the Asia-Pacific market rose 9% on the back of strong growth in South Korea, with demand at the company’s duty-free shops in China getting a boost from the government’s move to raise the annual tax-free shopping limit for tourists in the southern province of Hainan. Total sales at the company’s duty-free shops were flat year over year, after dropping roughly 30% in the previous quarter due to widespread restrictions on air travel. Total net sales fell 9% to $3.56 billion, but exceeded analysts’ expectations of $3.46 billion, Refinitiv data showed. Excluding items, the company earned $1.44 per share, beating estimates of 90 cents. It also increased its quarterly dividend by 10%. Estee forecast net sales to decline between 3% and 5% in the second quarter, compared with estimates of a near 5% decline.

21.59921091709822," Estee Lauder forecasts profit below expectations, to cut up to 2,000 jobs (Reuters) - Estee Lauder Cos Inc EL.N forecast current-quarter profit below analysts' estimates on Thursday after posting a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss, as travel restrictions and store closures put in place to contain the spread of coronavirus dampened demand for its premium makeup brands. The company and other cosmetic brands have been struggling in recent months with consumers adapting to the new work-from-home lifestyle and ordering more skincare products than makeup. This led to Estee Lauder posting a 32% decline in sales in the fourth quarter, pushing its shares down about 6% in premarket trading. The COVID-19 crisis has also made the M.A.C. brand owner reassess its business as consumers increasingly shop for beauty products online. Estee Lauder said on Thursday it would cut about 1,500 to 2,000 jobs or about 3% of its workforce globally and also expects to close about 10%-15% of its freestanding stores. Sales of makeup brands such as M.A.C. and Too Faced have taken a hit on falling demand for the New York-based company’s foundations and lip products. Overall annual sales for its makeup brands fell 18% as the COVID-19 pandemic offset the 5% growth seen in the first half of the year. Estee Lauder forecast first-quarter adjusted profit per share to be between 80 cents and 85 cents, below estimates of $1.22, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The company also expects sales to decline between 12% and 13%, compared to expectations of an 11.42% drop. Net sales fell 32% to $2.43 billion in the fourth quarter ended June 30, missing estimates of $2.45 billion.

14.489396744952037," Estee Lauder warns of weak sales as most stores remain shut under lockdown (Reuters) - Estee Lauder EL.N on Friday warned of weak quarterly sales due to COVID-19-led lockdowns in several markets, after it beat Wall Street's lowered estimates for third-quarter profit and sales on growth in China and higher online demand. The M.A.C owner said it expects a majority of its retail stores across the world to remain closed for most of the current quarter and warned that global prestige beauty products would be “adversely impacted”. “We are very much focused on the fact that demand remains strong. And it’s really the access to our products that has become challenging in markets like in Europe as well as in the Americas,” said Estee Lauder Chief Financial Officer Tracey Travis. The company, like other cosmetic makers, has been ramping up its online business to offset the fallout from the closure of department stores, airport duty free shops and beauty parlours due to lockdowns. The efforts helped Estee Lauder bring in a double-digit rise in global online sales in the third quarter. Estee Lauder and its French rival L'Oreal SA OREP.PA have seen sales of skin-care products recover in China in recent weeks as some lockdown measures in the country were eased and online sales surged. Estee Lauder on Friday said it expected sales in mainland China to return to double digit growth in the current quarter. Overall net sales in the third quarter fell for the first time in over three years, hit by a 23% decline in sales in North America, due to closed stores and salons. Confinement measures pressured make-up sales, as about 90% of women shun their cosmetic routines while working from home, according to a survey by Jefferies. Net sales fell 10.7% to $3.35 billion in the third quarter ended March 31, but was ahead of market expectations of $3.05 billion. At least five analysts lowered their sales estimates last month. Estee Lauder posted a loss of $6 million or 2 cents per share, compared with a profit of $555 million, or $1.51 per share, a year earlier, primarily due to virus-related $346 million writedowns on some brands. Excluding one-time items, the company earned 85 cents per share, beating the estimate of 73 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Estee Lauder also estimated its cost-cutting measures, including furloughs and salary reductions, to cut operating expenses by about $500 million to $600 million in the fourth quarter. Shares of the New York-based company, which fell about 15% this year, were down marginally at $175.38."

-19.656321073804826," UPDATE 2-Estee Lauder says coronavirus outbreak to dent 2020 profit (Adds estimates, segment details, quotes from analyst and executive; updates shares) Feb 6 (Reuters) - Estee Lauder Cos Inc cut its profit forecast for fiscal 2020 on Thursday, citing the coronavirus epidemic in China, a key market for the maker of Clinique skincare products. Shares of the New York-based company, however, rose 4% as investors looked past the forecast and focused instead on better-than-expected quarterly results, which were driven by strong demand for its products. Cosmetics makers, including Estee Lauder, have been thriving as affluent Chinese consumers splurge on premium makeup products and fragrances sold at beauty retailers and duty-free stores. The Jo Malone London fragrance maker posted a 29.3% increase in sales in the Asia Pacific region for the second quarter, driven by upbeat sales on Singles Day, China’s version of the United States’ Cyber Monday. Overall, sales rose 15.5% to $4.62 billion in the quarter ended Dec. 31, well above Wall Street expectations of $4.35 billion. “Our growth came from all facets of the business ... and we made progress towards the stabilization of our North American business despite continued softness in the makeup category,” Chief Executive Officer Fabrizio Freda said. Estee Lauder’s quarterly profit of $2.11 per share also came in above estimates of $1.90. Barclays analyst Lauren Lieberman said sales growth in the Americas was among many positive surprises. Sales in the Americas rose 1% for the first time in over a year. However, the coronavirus outbreak - which has killed over 500 people and forced businesses in China to temporarily shut stores - forced Estee Lauder to trim its fiscal 2020 per-share earnings forecast to between $5.60 and $5.70 from between $5.85 and $5.93. Estee Lauder said it has seen a significant decline in air travel and consumer traffic in key shopping and tourist areas, adding markets favored by tourists are likely to experience the greatest impact from the outbreak. China accounted for about 17% of the company’s sales in fiscal 2019, nearly doubling from a 9% contribution in fiscal 2017, according to the company’s regulatory filing. The company also cut the low end of its sales growth forecast range to 6% from 7%, while keeping the top end at 8%.

The outbreak of the new virus in the city of Wuhan late last year has hit the country’s retail industry, forcing businesses to temporarily shut stores and factories, with luxury goods makers among the most affected sectors. The epidemic adds to the troubles the company has faced in the Asia Pacific region as months of protests in Hong Kong also weighed on sales.

5.03062181569429," Hong Kong unrest, stronger dollar weigh on Estee Lauder's FY forecast (Reuters) - Estee Lauder Cos Inc EL.N cut its full-year profit forecast on Thursday as it expects to take a hit from the ongoing unrest in Hong Kong and a stronger dollar, taking the sheen off its better-than-expected results and sending its shares down 5%. Luxury goods companies and retailers have felt the pinch from months of pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong that have forced some shops to close temporarily, and kept tourists away from one of the world’s most vibrant shopping destinations. The cosmetics maker said net sales from Hong Kong, which makes up just under 4% of its global business, had fallen 20% in the first quarter. “Hong Kong has been difficult,” said Chief Executive Officer Fabrizio Freda on an earnings call with analysts, adding that there was no sign of improvement in the business there to date. Estee Lauder also said it was mindful of, among other risks, moderating growth in China from recent levels, where its sales have been growing in double digits on booming demand for high-end luxury products from affluent Chinese consumers. “Given the fact that there are global macro slowdowns, even though we haven’t, in fact, seen it in China and haven’t seen it affect our Asia business in general ... it certainly could happen,” Chief Financial Officer Tracey Travis said. The company said it expects 2020 adjusted profit between $5.85 and $5.93 per share, down from a prior range of $5.90 to $5.98. Estee Lauder, which generates 68% of revenue from Asia-Pacific, Europe, the Middle East and Africa market, said the strong dollar would hit its earnings by 5 cents per share. Another sore spot for the M.A.C brand owner was its Americas business, which is being pressured by weaker customer traffic at brick-and-mortar stores as customers shift to online shopping and buying at specialty beauty shops. “U.S. performance will remain a concern and focus for investors as market has decelerated after Estee Lauder had talked of sequential improvement in Q4,” Atlantic Equities analyst Edward Lewis said. Sales in the U.S. market fell 6%, while operating income dropped 25%. In contrast, Asia Pacific region that accounts for a quarter of total sales rose 24% in the quarter. Overall, net sales climbed 11% to $3.90 billion on the strength of its skin care brands like La Mer. Excluding items, Estee Lauder earned $1.68 per share. Analysts on average had expected revenue of $3.85 billion and adjusted profit of $1.60 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv."

Cosmetic companies like Estee Lauder and L'Oreal OREP.PA are seeing a boom in their business in the Asia-Pacific region, mainly in China, as affluent millennials spend more at beauty retailers and duty-free stores at airports. Shares of Estee Lauder, which reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results, rose as much as 11% to $198.62. The company has been selling 10 of its brands including M.A.C and Tom Ford on Alibaba's BABA.N online marketplace Tmall, in a bid to boost its presence in the Asian market. The efforts helped sales in the Asia-Pacific region grow 18% in the fourth quarter, while sales in the skincare business, its biggest and most profitable, rose 15% to $1.59 billion, boosted by demand for its premium skincare brands such as La Mer and Clinique. Estee Lauder expects full-year sales to grow in the range of 7% to 8% and adjusted profit between $5.90 and $5.98 per share in fiscal 2020. Analysts had expected sales growth of 6.87% and profit of $5.81 per share. Estee Lauder, which also forecast first-quarter sales growth and profit above expectations, said the outlook took into account the potential impact of the Hong Kong protests and the protracted U.S.-China trade dispute, as well as costs related to Britain’s impending exit from the European Union. “We are not seeing any slowdown in China at this point in time” Chief Executive Officer Fabrizio Freda said. Freda said Hong Kong, including travel retail, represented less than 4% of the company’s business globally, and the company was working to recover some of the potential losses in Hong Kong from other markets. “We are a little surprised by Estee’s aggressive approach to guidance for the year,” RBC analyst Nik Modi said. Overall, quarterly net sales rose 9% to $3.59 billion, beating expectations of $3.53 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

The company and its rivals such as Lancome owner L’Oreal have thrived in recent years on strong demand for cosmetics from affluent Chinese shoppers, who spend more on high-end luxury goods. Sales in Asia-Pacific (APAC), which includes China, grew 25 percent to $966 million in the quarter, allaying investor concerns of a potential slowdown in China’s economy due to the U.S.-China trade war. “We had anticipated a gradual moderation of growth in China and travel retail starting in the quarter, which didn’t happen and that contributed to our overachievement,” Chief Executive Fabrizio Freda said in a statement. The company, which has been selling about 10 of its brands including M.A.C and Tom Ford on Alibaba’s online marketplace Tmall, said the site was the largest contributor to its online sales in China. Pop-up stores in key airports also helped to attract traveling Chinese consumers. Sales in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) - Estee Lauder’s biggest revenue generator - also rose 15 percent to $1.63 billion on higher demand for luxury brands at duty free stores. Skincare sales surged 21 percent in the quarter, with strong growth at its namesake brand and La Mer. “The combo of APAC + travel retail + Skincare is a powerful driver,” noted Jefferies analyst Stephanie Wissink. Estee Lauder now expects fiscal 2019 net sales to increase between 7 percent and 8 percent, up from previous guidance of 5 percent and 6 percent. Excluding restructuring and other charges, the company expects earnings per share in the range of $5.15 to $5.19, compared with prior expectations of $4.92 to $5.

Sales in the Asia-Pacific region grew 17 percent, crossing $1 billion for the first time, as the company benefited from its efforts to expand its business in international markets. Chief Executive Fabrizio Freda said in a post-earnings call that demand for its luxury beauty products from the Chinese consumer has remained strong despite potential risks to the economy, including higher tariffs. “So far, we have not seen an impact and remain optimistic about the long-term health and resilience of prestige beauty in China,” said Freda about the region where the company recorded double-digit growth in sales. In China, the company has collaborated with local celebrities such as Yang Mi and Fei Fei Sun and has been selling on Alibaba’s online marketplace Tmall, while also using the country’s social media channels to lure the Chinese consumer. “EL’s China market share gains continued, with particular strength in e-commerce, which now accounts for more than one-third of sales in China,” Morgan Stanley Equity Analyst Dara Mohsenian said. Sales in the company’s skincare business - its biggest - grew 16 percent in the quarter to $1.73 billion. Overall, net sales rose 7 percent to $4.01 billion, also topping analysts’ average expectation of $3.92 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

Chief Executive Officer Fabrizio Freda, like L’Oreal CEO Jean-Paul Agon earlier in the day, said he saw no signs of the slowdown expected by many investors due to pressure on Chinese growth from U.S. tariffs and easing global demand. Those comments lifted shares across the consumer sector in both Europe and the United States, with Estée Lauder up as much as 12 percent. “(In China) there is risk that the momentum slows going forward but it appears to be performing better than expected in the short term,” Morgan Stanley analyst Dara Mohsenian said.

Overall, sales in the Asia-Pacific region rose 24 percent, led by China and Japan. L'Oreal reported stronger-than-expected results earlier on Wednesday. Fashion group Gucci's owner Kering PRTP.PA and Italian down jacket maker Moncler MONC.MI have also played down gloomy market views on China. Estée Lauder said it expects to grow at a faster clip than the broader global prestige beauty industry’s market growth rate of 5 percent to 6 percent for fiscal 2019, and raised its full-year profit forecast.

Analysts have said Estee’s more premium products and wide portfolio of cosmetics products helps it offset much of the slowdown in U.S. retail. Sales at Estee’s skincare products jumped 29 percent in the quarter and beat the analyst average estimate, offsetting a slowdown in sales at its makeup business that posted its slowest growth in nearly two years. Makeup sales were muted due to weak demand for its M.A.C. cosmetics in the United States where store traffic continues to fall at both department and standalone stores. Overall, quarterly sales rose 14 percent to $3.3 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of $3.25 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Chief Executive Fabrizio Freda said the proposed Chinese tariffs on cosmetics would be “less onerous” than commodities as its gross margins of 80 percent give it breathing room to take some impact. “We will do our best to manage tariffs if they happen, without impacting pricing directly,” he said. Estee expects earnings of $1.18-$1.22 per share, compared with the analysts’ average estimate of $1.32, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company’s first-quarter sales are expected to rise 4-5 percent, or $3.40 billion-$3.44 billion, but was below the average estimate of $3.50 billion, mainly due to a stronger dollar. Net income fell 19 percent to $186 million or 49 cents per share in the quarter ended June 30. Excluding items it earned 61 cents per share, beating the average estimate of 56 cents. Shares of the company rose as much as 6.6 percent and was trading up about 3 percent at $139.98 in afternoon trading."

3.39165262454246," Weak U.S. sales cloud Estee Lauder's profit beat (Reuters) - Estee Lauder Cos Inc EL.N topped expectations for quarterly profit on Wednesday but investors were worried about slowing U.S. sales as fewer shoppers visit department stores where the company sells a bulk of its products. Sales were flat in North America, compared with a 38 percent growth in the Asia-Pacific region, but that was enough to knock 5 percent off the stock which has gained more than two-thirds in value over the past year. Brands such as Clinique and Smashbox, which the company pushes through makeup counters in department stores, have been facing a decline as shoppers opt to purchase discounted products online or through specialty shops such as Ulta Beauty ULTA.O and personalized makeup subscriptions like Birchbox and Ipsy. “The only blemish in the quarter was continued softness in the U.S. where mid-tier department store challenges continue to weigh upon EL’s delivery,” Oppenheimer & Co analyst Rupesh Parikh said, adding that the recent bankruptcy of Bon-Ton would mount further pressure. The 72-year old company is also using social media to target a younger audience, while encouraging a network of bloggers who promote its products through makeup and grooming tips. These initiatives, however, increased operating expenses by 19 percent to $2.2 billion. Estee Lauder also recorded a $100 million restructuring charge in the third quarter related to a multi-year initiative launched in 2016. Its skin-care division was a bright spot, posting double-digit revenue growth in China and at duty-free stores at airports. Total skin-care sales surged 31 percent to $1.45 billion. Estee Lauder said it expects full-year adjusted profit of $4.38 to $4.42 per share, largely above the average estimate of $4.37 per share. Net earnings rose to $372 million, or 99 cents per share, in the third quarter ended March 31, from $298 million, or 80 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, the company earned $1.17 per share, topping analysts’ average estimate of $1.07, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales rose 18 percent to $3.37 billion, also exceeding analysts’ estimates. Estee also said on Wednesday tests on some of its product advertising claims did not meet company standards, but added that the claims did not relate to the quality or safety of the products. A company spokeswoman said claims for new product launches would not be affected. Shares of the New York-based company fell as much as 5 percent, on track for their worst day in nearly two years.
