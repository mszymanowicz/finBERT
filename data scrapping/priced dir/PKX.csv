The world’s fifth-biggest steelmaker reported 2020 operating profit of 2.4 trillion won ($2.15 billion), according to the company statement. POSCO’s fourth-quarter operating profit was 863 billion won ($771.42 million), the statement said, versus an average estimate for an 850 billion won profit from 15 analysts, according to Refinitiv SmartEstimate. Consolidated operating margins in 2020 were 4.2%, down from 6% in 2019, the company said. The margins were pressured by a “delayed reflection of rising raw material price on product prices,” it said. Benchmark Chinese iron ore prices surged in 2020, breaking the 1,000 yuan ($154.04) per tonne level for the first time in December, on supply concerns and as commodity-intensive stimulus measures in China fuelled demand. For 2021, POSCO said it expects higher consolidated sales at 59.4 trillion won. It also said its capital expenditure and other investments are expected to be 6.1 trillion won in 2021. POSCO shares closed down 3.7% before the earnings release, while the wider market closed 1.7% lower.

16.10330231674897," Tata Steel, POSCO join forces to develop hyperloop tubes LONDON (Reuters) - Tata Steel Europe and South Korea’s POSCO will collaborate to develop steel tubes needed for high-speed hyperloop transportation systems, the companies said on Monday. Richard Branson’s Virgin Hyperloop on Sunday completed the world’s first passenger ride on their levitating pod system, which it hopes will transform human and cargo transportation while slashing carbon emissions. Tata Steel Europe, a unit of India’s Tata Steel, said in a joint statement with the world’s fifth biggest steelmaker POSCO that they would develop high-quality steel grades needed for the huge vacuum tubes that allow high-speed transport using very little energy. “POSCO has been conducting hyperloop related research such as feasibility, design and structural optimisation of various types of steel tubes for more than 10 years,” said Duk-Lak Lee, head of technical research laboratories at POSCO. The steel tubes not only need to allow a vehicle to travel in a low-pressure environment, where air is removed to cut resistance, but retain straightness over very long distances, the companies said. They neither gave a time frame nor financial details for their hyperloop project. In a hyperloop system, which uses magnetic levitation to allow near-silent travel, a trip between New York and Washington would take just 30 minutes. That would be twice as fast as a commercial jet flight and four times faster than a high-speed train."

The world’s fifth-biggest steelmaker said steel production and sales recovered to pre-COVID-19 levels during the quarter as coronavirus restrictions eased globally, after demand for steel was hard hit by the pandemic earlier this year. POSCO said in a statement it expected continued improvement in sales and profitability, as well as solid cash flows, in the current quarter. Consolidated operating profit for the July-September quarter was 667 billion won ($587.55 million) versus 1 trillion won a year earlier, POSCO said in a statement. It rose from 168 billion won in the second quarter. That beat an estimate of 521 billion won from 10 analysts, according to an average Refinitiv estimate. The company’s third-quarter revenue fell 11% year-on-year to 14.3 trillion won, and its net profit rose 4% to 514 billion won. Steel demand from automakers and builders was hit in the first half of the year as many countries imposed lockdowns to try to contain the spread of the coronavirus. But since then, heavy stimulus spending in China for construction and infrastructure has helped lift steel consumption, while analysts expect demand to continue to recover next year. The coronavirus-related decline in global steel demand this year will be less than expected at 2.4% after a buoyant recovery in China, the World Steel Association (WSA) said this month. In June, it had forecast a 6.4% decline. POSCO shares were up 2.6% by 0147 GMT after the earnings announcement, while the wider market fell 0.2%."

-6.517151869547698," South Korea's POSCO drops plans for Chilean battery material plant SANTIAGO/SEOUL(Reuters) - South Korea’s POSCO has pulled out of a project to build battery parts in Chile, the Asian steelmaker said, little more than a year after winning guaranteed access to cheap lithium from top producer Albemarle. POSCO, together with partner Samsung SDI, won a 2018 Chilean government tender to build a battery-parts factory in the country’s northern desert in exchange for a 27-year supply of low-cost lithium. The problem, POSCO told Reuters, is that the project it proposed requires lithium hydroxide, a type of the metal increasingly favored by makers of batteries for electric vehicles (EV) but one not produced by Albemarle in Chile. Albemarle in Chile primarily produces lithium carbonate, a variety of the metal that is widely used in smaller consumer electronics. Samsung, the world’s largest maker of smartphones, told Reuters that it is still reviewing the project following POSCO’s announcement. POSCO’s decision is the latest in a string of setbacks for Chile, which has struggled to modernize its lithium policies, boost output and develop a domestic battery industry, despite having the world’s largest supplies of the metal and rising global EV demand. Albemarle and the Chilean government in 2016 signed an agreement that allows Albemarle to more than triple its output of lithium, which is critically important for batteries for electric cars. But the deal requires the company reserve as much as 25% of its production for companies seeking to build batteries or their parts in Chile. The agreement does not specify whether Albemarle should produce lithium carbonate or lithium hydroxide at its facilities. Albemarle and Corfo, which leases the company its mining rights in Chile, initially disagreed on how to price the lithium it would provide to the battery makers, but have since come to agreement. Neither has offered details of the settlement. China’s Sichuan Fulin Transportation Group Co and Chile’s privately held Molymet also won access to the discounted lithium in last year’s tender. An Albemarle spokesman confirmed the Posco-Samsung joint venture “was not interested in the lithium carbonate produced by Albemarle in Chile,” but said the company was still in open discussions with Fulin and Molymet. Fulin and Molymet did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the status of their projects. Following last year’s tender, Chile’s government said the three projects together would bring $754 million in investment to Chile, and promised at least 664 jobs would be created. The deals were widely seen as a foot in the door into Chile as countries and global corporations scramble to lock down supplies of key metals used in batteries that power cell phones, tablets and electric vehicles. POSCO last summer said it would build a lithium plant in Argentina to help secure its own supply. That announcement came as POSCO also said it would buy lithium mining rights in Argentina from Galaxy Resource Ltd’s in a deal worth $280 million."

Ahn Yoon-gih, senior vice president of POSCO’s steel business, told Reuters in an interview that the world’s fifth-largest steelmaker will continue to make its steelmaking process cleaner, following the country’s toughened law on high concentrations of pollutants. “In response to that we may invest as much as 200 billion won, or at least 100 billion won,” Ahn said. South Korea, Asia’s fourth-largest economy, has been fighting air pollution in recent years. In March, it designated the problem as a “social disaster”, as a way to step up its efforts to tackle the issue. The company said in February it would spend a total of 1.07 trillion won over the next three years to build environmentally friendly facilities and reduce emissions. In addition to reducing pollutants, POSCO also aims to increase the use of steel scrap in its production to lower its dependence on imported raw materials and prolong the life cycle of steel, Ahn said, declining to give exact figures and targets due to confidentiality. “Recycling is a must to secure materials and that would make us use less iron ore,” he said. POSCO produces about 42 million tonnes a year of crude steel, while importing around 60 million tonnes a year of iron ore. Although growing demand for electric vehicle has intensified competition between steel and other materials such as aluminum, Ahn said, light-weight steel has an edge over other metals in terms of durability and sustainability. “Steel is recyclable and can be used for 75 years and even more than 100 years ...

While India and Southeast Asia demand should grow, Chinese demand may remain flat as economic growth cools. Steel prices in China, the world’s biggest consumer and producer of the construction material, have fallen about 27 percent since October, dragged down by concerns over oversupply and the Sino-U.S. trade dispute. Meanwhile POSCO said it expected to increase capital expenditure and other investments to 6.1 trillion won this year from 2.7 trillion won in 2018. POSCO shares ended up 6.2 percent before the earnings announcement, lifted by investor expectations that steel prices will rise following the deadly collapse of a dam operated by Brazilian iron ore miner Vale.

-0.9530241985372476," POSCO posts highest quarterly profit since 2011 on strong steel prices SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's top steelmaker POSCO 005490.KS posted its highest quarterly profit since 2011 and said it expected sales revenue for all of 2018 to be lifted by higher steel prices. The world’s fifth-largest steelmaker raised its revenue outlook for the full-year to 64.8 trillion won ($57.0 billion) from its previous forecast of 64.1 trillion won in July, POSCO said in its filing on Tuesday. Steel prices SRBcv1 in China, the world's biggest consumer and producer of the construction material, have risen nearly 20 percent this year, supported by disruptions to output from policies aimed at tackling pollution and excess capacity. Looking ahead, Kim Gwang-soo, executive vice president of POSCO, told an earnings’ call with analysts that steel prices are expected to stay strong in the fourth quarter on solid demand, helping the company’s fourth-quarter profit remain firm. “An increase in (China’s) steel production in the third quarter and lower-than-expected steel production cuts have weighed on prices ... but demand is expected to grow in the fourth quarter and China will reduce its steel production even though the cut may be smaller (than last year),” Kim said. In September, China’s daily steel output hit a record high of 2.7 million tonnes on average, as mills in the world’s top producer ramped up production ahead of government-led winter production curbs to fight air pollution. Production restrictions set by China’s top steelmaking city Tangshan, however, were seen as less strict this year than last year as the Chinese government allowed local governments to set their own output curbs. POSCO’s consolidated operating profit rose 36 percent to 1.5 trillion won for July-September, versus 1.1 trillion won a year earlier, the steelmaker said. The profit jump was higher than an average estimate of 1.4 trillion won from 11 analysts, according to Refinitiv data. POSCO’s revenue in the third quarter rose 9.1 percent from a year earlier to 16.4 trillion won, beating the analysts’ estimate of 16 trillion won. POSCO shares fell 2.1 percent on Tuesday, while the wider market .KS11 dropped 2.6 percent."

-25.7670417720857," POSCO buys lithium mining rights in Argentina from Australia's Galaxy SEOUL/MELBOURNE (Reuters) - South Korean steelmaker POSCO has sealed a deal to buy lithium mining rights in Argentina from Galaxy Resources for $280 million, beefing up the Australian miner’s funds to dig a lithium mine on neighbouring ground. POSCO said in a statement on Monday that it would also build a lithium plant in Argentina, planning to produce 25,000 tonnes of the commodity per year for 20 years starting from 2021. Demand for lithium, a critical ingredient for batteries used in electric vehicles, has grown in recent years as some consumers shift away from cars powered by fossil fuels. POSCO said the move would secure stable lithium supplies for its battery material manufacturing affiliate POSCO ES Materials. Galaxy, which agreed in May to sell the rights for the Salar del Hombre Muerto salt flat in northern Argentina, plans to use the funds to develop its flagship Sal de Vida lithium project in South America. Galaxy has shortlisted seven firms as potential strategic partners at Sal de Vida, and hopes to decide on the best option before the end of 2018, Managing Director Anthony Tse told Reuters. The shortlist includes Chinese, other Asian and non-Asian firms, including lithium end-users, firms already in the lithium industry and materials and industrial firms looking to get into the lithium supply chain, Tse said. “You probably would be surprised in terms of some of the not-so-usual suspects that you might see on that list,” Tse said in an interview. He said the deal with POSCO was carried out separately as the South Korean steel giant was focused on developing its own lithium processing technology, but he expected there will be opportunities for them to share infrastructure. “They wanted to get their hands on a fairly sizable and high quality resource in the region,” Tse said. Shares in Galaxy, one of the Australian market’s most heavily shorted stocks, jumped as much as 11 percent on Tuesday after the deal with POSCO was signed. The stock last traded up 3 percent outperforming a 0.6 percent rise in the broader market. Tse said that while the world’s major lithium producers Chile’s SQM, FMC Lithium and Albemarle Corp have mixed views on the outlook for near-term lithium carbonate prices, Galaxy expects rising demand to shore up prices. “We’re somewhat positive in that we think the raw material consumption will actually step up as (electric vehicle) production has to step up in the second part of the year.” Over the past two to three years, China’s electric vehicle production has been much stronger in the second half of the year than the first half, driving up demand for battery materials later in the year. Demand is also expected to rise in Japan and South Korea, Tse said."

The world’s fifth-largest steelmaker raised its revenue outlook for 2018 to 64.1 trillion won ($56.7 billion) from its April forecast of 63 trillion won. POSCO said in a filing it expected Chinese steel prices to remain high on tighter supplies following a shutdown of old mills amid ongoing restructuring in the China steel business. The brighter full-year forecast comes after consolidated operating profit for April-June climbed 28 percent to 1.25 trillion won from 979.1 billion won a year earlier. That was slightly below a bullish average estimate for POSCO’s core earnings of 1.32 trillion won from 12 analysts polled by Reuters. Revenue for the quarter advanced 7.6 percent to 16.08 trillion won from 14.95 trillion won a year ago, helped by rising prices. That trend showed up in Shanghai benchmark steel , up 14 percent in April-June from the previous quarter with firm demand and lower output in China. On Monday POSCO said it expected average prices for iron ore, a key input in steelmaking, to be between $60 and $65 per tonne in the third quarter, down from $65 per tonne in the second quarter. For coking coal, another vital raw material for the steel business, POSCO expects prices to be lower in the third quarter at between $175 and $185 per tonne, compared with $190 per tonne in the previous quarter. POSCO shares ended up 3.6 percent prior to the earnings announcement, released after Seoul’s bourse closed, outpacing the wider market’s about 1 percent decline.

The land is located in the northern area of the giant Salar del Hombre Muerto salt flat. Galaxy will retain ownership of all tenements in the southern basin. The company intends to use the proceeds from the deal to fund development of its flagship Sal de Vida project. “This transaction with POSCO provides a substantial cash injection which underpins the development of Galaxy’s Sal de Vida brine project in the Catamarca Province of Argentina”, Chairman Martin Rowley said. Galaxy had earlier appointed JP Morgan Australia to evaluate “strategic options” for its Sal de Vida lithium and potash project in Argentina. Sal de Vida has the potential to generate total annual revenues around $354 million, scaling up to 25,000 tonnes per year of lithium carbonate and 95,000 tonnes of potassium chloride, according to the company’s website.

The world’s fifth-biggest steelmaker said in a statement that it expected steel demand to keep growing thanks to “sustained restructuring in China’s steel industry and expectations of recovery in emerging market growth”. POSCO posted a consolidated operating profit of 1.49 trillion won ($1.38 billion) for the January-to-March period, compared with 1.37 trillion won a year earlier and an average estimate of 1.37 trillion won from 16 analysts polled by Reuters. Its first quarter revenue was up 5 percent at 15.9 trillion won, while its net profit climbed 10.9 percent to 1.1 trillion won. The steelmaker also raised its 2018 consolidated sales target to 63 trillion won from 61.9 trillion won. In the first quarter of this year, China’s economy grew 6.8 percent on the back of robust consumer demand and property investment. Although U.S. steel tariffs could pose a risk to Asian producers, South Korean steelmakers were exempted from hefty steel tariffs in March in exchange for capping the country’s steel exports to the United States by 30 percent of the past three years’ average. The company expected iron ore prices to be between $65 and $70 per tonne in the second quarter following the U.S. import tariffs, down from $74 a tonne in the first quarter. Coking coal prices are expected to be between $180 and $190 per tonne in the second quarter, down from 229 per tonne in the previous quarter, it said. POSCO is also looking for a new chief executive after Kwon Oh-joon tendered his resignation last week saying the company should be managed by a younger leader.

Kwon Oh-joon, 69, offered his resignation at an emergency board meeting, but will stay in the post until the company appoints a new chief, a spokesman said. Kwon took over as CEO of the country’s top steelmaker in March 2014. He was re-appointed in March last year, and his term was set to end in March 2020. POSCO in January reported a 144 percent surge in fourth-quarter operating profit, helped by steel price gains, but fell short of market estimates as higher raw material costs cut into earnings. The spokesman denied any link between Kwon’s resignation offer and a change of government last May. POSCO was privatized in 2000, but chief executives have previously been replaced when a new administration takes office, local media reported."
