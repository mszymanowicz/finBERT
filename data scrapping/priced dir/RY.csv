Bank of Nova Scotia, Bank of Montreal, National Bank of Canada and Royal Bank of Canada all cut their provisions after three straight quarters of adding for credit losses. CIBC set aside $291 million for the provisions in the fourth quarter ended Oct. 31, down 28% from a year earlier. Net income fell 14% to C$1.02 billion ($788.80 million), as weakness at CIBC’s U.S. commercial banking and wealth management businesses offset gains in its capital markets unit. Canada’s big 6 banks have reported strong results from their capital market businesses in the quarter, helped by increased volatility in markets due to the health crisis.

Provisions for credit losses at Royal Bank, Canada’s largest lender, fell to C$427 million ($329.65 million) in the three months through October, by over a third from the previous quarter’s multi-year high and 14% from its year-ago, pre-pandemic level. Analysts had expected nearly C$800 million. National Bank, the smallest of Canada’s six largest lenders, took provisions of C$110 million, versus the nearly C$160 million expected. Over the past three quarters, Canadian banks have set aside billions of dollars to cover a spike in sour loans due to the economic impact of the coronavirus crisis. While the surge has resulted in profit declines, their allowances for bad loans are now at multi-year highs. On Tuesday, rivals Bank of Montreal and Bank of Nova Scotia also beat expectations on lower provisions than analysts had anticipated, and said their allowances were sufficient to cover any increase in impaired loans in fiscal 2021. Royal Bank’s gross impaired loans fell 17% from the previous quarter, while they rose 3% at National Bank. Royal Bank reported adjusted net income of C$2.27 per share, versus estimates of C$2.05.

6.7565422487552595," CORRECTED-UPDATE 1-RBC profit beats estimates on capital markets strength, lower provisions (Corrects adjusted EPS figure in last paragraph) Dec 2 (Reuters) - Royal Bank of Canada reported a small rise in quarterly profit that beat analysts’ expectations on Wednesday, driven by strength in its capital markets unit and reduced provisions to cover potential loan-losses from the COVID-19 pandemic. Canada’s largest lender by market capitalization set aside C$427 million in the fourth quarter, as economic disruptions from the pandemic raised the possibility of defaults. The amount was far lower than analysts’ expectation of C$798.75 million, and down 14% from a year earlier. Net income from personal and commercial banking - RBC’s biggest source of income - fell 7% to C$1.5 billion, largely reflecting the impact of lower interest rates. The country’s banks have faced margin pressure this year from surging deposits and slower lending growth across retail and business segments. RBC’s capital markets division, which includes trading, investment banking and advisory, however, saw net income soar 44% to C$840 million, helped by increased volatility in markets due to the health crisis. Total net income rose to C$3.25 billion ($2.51 billion) for the quarter ended Oct. 31, or C$2.23 per share, from C$3.21 billion, or C$2.19 per share, a year earlier.

11.556896572143993," Canada's RBC turns heads in U.S. with wealth management recruitment push TORONTO (Reuters) - Royal Bank of Canada's RY.TO U.S. wealth management unit has been luring teams managing bigger amounts of assets from much larger rivals, driving a surge in revenue from the new recruits and helping it outperform others in the industry. As recently as August, the U.S. unit of Canada's biggest lender hired a team of four advisors from Morgan Stanley MS.N who managed $675 million in client assets, building on additions from other competitors including AllianceBernstein AB.N, Wells Fargo WFC.N, Bank of America's Merrill Lynch BAC.N and UBS UBSG.S, according to RBC Wealth Management. RBC’s recruitment push helped lift average revenue per new advisor, or production, by 43% year-to-date through July from the comparable year-earlier period, even as the number of hires remained flat, according to internal data from its U.S. wealth management unit that was shared exclusively with Reuters. “The U.S. is a great opportunity for the enterprise, given it is 10 to 11 times bigger than the Canadian market,” Michael Armstrong, the chief executive of RBC’S U.S. wealth management unit, said in an interview. “The key premise behind recruiting for us is that it’s really important that we try to reach scale in our business,” he said, adding that the business doesn’t have specific growth targets. Across North America, wealth management companies saw average annual growth of 5% in revenue per advisor between 2015 and 2019, a period that culminated in record assets and revenues, according to a June report from McKinsey’s PriceMetrix unit. Data for 2020 was not yet available. RBC has made inroads into U.S. wealth management since its acquisition of Minneapolis-based brokerage and investment bank Dain Rauscher Wessels nearly two decades ago, which it combined with City National following its 2015 acquisition. Overall U.S. wealth management client assets grew to $30.5 trillion in 2018, up 64% from 2010, according to a January report from McKinsey. Stephen Biggar, an analyst at Argus Research, attributed RBC’s success in drawing teams from more entrenched players in the U.S. wealth management arena to its willingness to invest in growth. “In some cases, there’s a bit of frustration with some of the larger firms,” he said. “If you want to grow a certain business, you have to spend ... RBC has gotten the return on that investment. That’s why they’ve not been in a cost-cutting mood.” In July, Wells Fargo announced a broad cost-cutting initiative and UBS’s wealth management unit said in January it was axing as many as 500 jobs globally. Armstrong noted that RBC had made important investments in technology and advisor platforms. RBC declined to disclose details about the investments, but said they were in the “tens of millions of dollars” and the amount was up three-fold in the last four years. The company’s compensation is also “consistently very competitive,” said a spokeswoman for RBC’s U.S. wealth management unit, without providing details. Production by financial advisors with high asset values is typically about 1% of assets under management, with compensation at 40% to 45% of that, said Jeff Testerman, managing partner at BrokerHunter.com, a financial services employment website. The lure of compensation, however, could be a pitfall, said Patrick Kennedy, co-founder of PriceMetrix. “If an advisor is likely to move once, they’re likely to move twice,” Kennedy said. RBC Wealth Management’s U.S. assets under administration were up 7% to $436.4 billion as of the end of July, a touch below the record set in January. That compared with a 1% increase at Bank of America Corp’s wealth unit to $2.9 trillion and a 3.5% jump at Morgan Stanley to $2.7 trillion, the firms with the biggest wealth management units. The United States accounts for 53% of RBC’s total wealth management client assets of C$1.1 trillion ($842 billion), versus Canada’s 38% share. Wealth management has contributed about 19.6% of RBC’s total earnings this year, compared with 18.8% in 2019. RBC does not break down wealth management profits by region. While the U.S. unit functions separately from its Canadian counterpart, the competitive recruiting is similar to what the bank has done in Canada for years, said Tony Maiorino, head of RBC Wealth Management’s Canadian unit in Toronto. But Maiorino stressed the Canadian unit has been “very focused” on marrying investment management with wealth planning, by expanding offerings including tax, estate and succession planning to existing clients. This has been the “largest contributor” to success in Canada, he said, while recruitment has been a major driver of U.S. growth. “RBC is in a leading position in Canada and there’s less room to grow, so their focus there would be more on client retention,” said John Mackerey, senior vice president for North American financial institutions at DBRS Morningstar. “They have greater room for expansion in the U.S., and a bigger runway to expand in a fragmented market.”"
9.121269513044075," Canada's Royal Bank, National Bank post profit beat on markets strength, fewer provisions TORONTO (Reuters) - Royal Bank of Canada and National Bank of Canada comfortably beat estimates for third-quarter profit on Wednesday as they set aside about half the money analysts had expected to cover bad loans. But executives at Canada’s biggest bank RBC said on an analyst call that the lender is putting greater emphasis on its downside scenario to reflect the “increasing uncertainty about how the economy will perform through the fall.” That scenario assumes Canadian unemployment will remain at around 10% until mid-2022, and home prices will decline 8% and remain depressed until mid-2023. RBC and National Bank set aside C$675 million ($512.3 million) and C$143 million in provisions respectively, including on performing loans in anticipation of higher delinquencies as government and customer support programs aimed at helping clients hurt by the coronavirus pandemic wind down. RBC also received a boost from its capital markets business, which posted a 45% jump in earnings. Shares of both RBC and National Bank rose 2.1% in morning trading in Toronto, on track for their highest close in six months. The Toronto stock benchmark added 0.4%. Both banks’ smaller-than-expected provisions were attributable to their “sizable reserve build” in the previous quarter, Credit Suisse analyst Mike Rizvanovic wrote in a note. But the weaker performance of both lenders’ Canadian banking businesses, driven by more margin compression than anticipated and higher provisions, raised concerns about more challenges in future quarters. RBC said about 70% of customers with deferred loans were in Canadian banking, where active deferral balances accounted for 12% of the total loan portfolio. Most of these wind down in the fourth quarter. Deferred loans at National Bank account for 5.6% of its portfolio, the lender said. Investors had surmised before the results announcements that extended and expanded assistance programs that helped keep borrowers in decent shape likely contained loan impairments at Canadian banks. That also helped support capital levels, with RBC posting an increase in its Common Equity Tier 1 ratio - the core measure of a bank’s capital - from the prior quarter to 12%, while National Bank maintained its level of 11.4%. Both were above the regulatory requirement of 9%. On Tuesday, Bank of Montreal also posted better-than-expected earnings, while Bank of Nova Scotia missed estimates, weighed down by its Latin American business, which was hit by the coronavirus pandemic later than North America.

1.005910648248868," RBC cuts ties with Canadian charity at center of Trudeau ethics probe (Reuters) - Royal Bank of Canada said on Tuesday it reached a mutual agreement to end all sponsorships with and donations to Canada’s WE Charity, which has been drawn into controversy surrounding an ethics inquiry into Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Canada’s ethics commissioner launched an inquiry into Trudeau’s participation in a Cabinet decision to use the charity, with which his family has ties, to administer a multi-million-dollar student grant program. RBC said it had conducted a review of the partnership. The charity said it had mutually decided with its Canadian partners to suspend partnerships out of concern for their reputation and investment commitments, and had also suspended formal agreements with its school board partners. WE Charity disclosed earlier this month that it paid speaking fees of C$250,000 to Trudeau’s mother, Margaret, in recent years, and about C$32,000 to his brother, Alexandre. But WE Charity founders Craig and Marc Kielburger defended their efforts to set up the grant program before a parliamentary committee. The charity said it would no longer manage the program about a week after it had been announced. “WE Charity agreed to implement the Canada Student Service Grant not to be helped by government, but to help government – and to help young people across Canada,” Craig Kielburger said, adding that “there was no financial benefit for the charity.” Trudeau and his wife, Sophie Gregoire Trudeau, have also participated in the charity’s events. “We regret that we didn’t recognize how this decision would be perceived,” Craig Kielburger said. “As we see the organization today, the fallout now from this political process has resulted in serious challenges that risk the entire organization and 25 years of work.”"

RBC joins Bank of America BAC.N, which announced $1 billion to address racial inequality, and others, including Alphabet Inc's Google GOOGL.O and Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O, in committing funds for racial justice causes following the death of George Floyd, a Black man killed by a Minneapolis police officer in May. Across Canada’s top six banks, people of color account for only about 10% of senior executives, according to a Reuters analysis, but none of the top six banks had either a Black CEO or a board member. Minorities made up 37% of RBC’s Canadian workforce and 35% of U.S. employees in 2019, according to a report. RBC said in a statement it has to better understand, identify and address issues that impede the success of Black, Indigenous and other racialized groups at the bank. The Canadian Council of Business Leaders Against Anti-Black Systemic Racism in June urged business leaders to commit to increasing Black representation among their workforces, executives and board roles by 2025. “Many Canadian companies have made statements condemning anti-Black systemic racism it’s now time to back that up with action by signing the pledge,” founder Wes Hall, who also runs shareholder services firm Kingsdale Advisors, said in a statement. RBC did not say when it seeks to reach its 30% firm-wide target for non-white executive hires. The bank pledged C$100 million in small business loans over five years to Black entrepreneurs and a C$50 million investment until 2025 to create opportunities for 25,000 Black, Indigenous and people of color. Last month, Manulife Financial Corp MFC.TO and Bank of Nova Scotia BNS.TO pledged C$3.5 million and C$500,000 respectively for diversity initiatives."

15.900110316874146," UPDATE 1-AG unit seeks ruling to prevent RBC from auctioning off mortgage debt (Adds details of market disruptions, context) March 25 (Reuters) - An AG Mortgage Investment Trust unit on Wednesday sought to prevent Royal Bank of Canada (RBC) from auctioning off nearly $11 million of its commercial mortgage-backed securities the lender is a counterparty to, according to a court filing. RBC, Canada’s biggest bank, and other lenders have taken advantage of lack of liquidity created by a flight of investors from non-government-debt to mark down these assets and “to trigger widespread margin calls,” AG MIT CMO, the AG subsidiary, said in a request for a temporary restraining order and injunction filed in the U.S. Southern New York District Court. A RBC spokeswoman declined to comment. Mortgage real estate investment trusts (REITs) have been savaged recently as recession fears driven by the new coronavirus outbreak spurred risk aversion and concerns about home loan defaults, prompting a deluge of margin calls from lenders. The exclusion of some parts of the mortgage-backed debt market from the Federal Reserve’s stimulus measures has prompted criticism by investors and warnings that the U.S. commercial real estate mortgage market is on the brink of collapse. Mortgage REITs like AG fund operations by selling mortgage bonds to lenders in exchange for short-term loans, with an agreement to repurchase them at a pre-determined price on an agreed-upon date. A decline in the securities’ market values prompts demands from the lenders for additional payments, known as margin calls. RBC issued margin calls to AG on Monday, AG said in the filing. On Tuesday, AG learned that RBC intended to conduct a CMBS auction on Wednesday at 11 a.m. EST, including AG’s bonds, according to the filing. It was unclear if the auction went ahead. A lawyer for AG did not immediately respond to requests seeking comment. Such an auction would “likely precipitate a chain reaction of other banks being pressured to foreclose on other (mortgage real estate investment trusts’) pledged securities, all at prices informed by the fire sale that Defendants seek to hold,” AG said in the filing. The Wall Street Journal earlier reported that RBC was seeking bids on Wednesday for more than $600 million of debt tied to commercial mortgages. AG on Monday reported an “unusually high” number of margin calls from financing counterparties. It said that it did not expect to be able to fund the anticipated volume of future margin calls, and that it was discussing agreements with counterparties to hold off on exercising their rights.

5.00625418454393," UPDATE 1-RBC CEO sees 'fairly material short-term impact' from measures to control coronavirus TORONTO, March 10 (Reuters) - Royal Bank of Canada Chief Executive Officer Dave McKay said on Tuesday “fairly material short-term impact” from global measures to contain the coronavirus outbreak is likely, although the economic effects remain difficult to predict. But he warned that interest rate cuts alone may not be sufficient to deal with the situation after Canadian and U.S. central banks last week cut key rates by 50 basis points to gird against the fallout of the outbreak. “I don’t think purely monetary rate cuts are going to satisfy the disruption,” McKay said, adding that there are ongoing dialogues with governments around the world around coordinated and targeted fiscal stimulus. On Monday, RBC confirmed that one of its employees had tested positive for the coronavirus. Canadian banks including RBC have joined global counterparts in splitting their trading operations to reduce disruptions due to the outbreak. “An abundance of caution is appropriate as we try to figure out how to get global control” of the coronavirus, McKay said at the RBC Capital Markets Financial Institutions Conference in New York, which was held as a remote event due to the outbreak. More than 114,000 people have been infected with the virus and over 4,000 have died, according to a Reuters tally of government announcements. Airlines and tourism have been particularly hard hit, and global supply chains have been disrupted as a result of the outbreak. McKay said he envisions three economic impact scenarios: where the crisis is contained within four to six weeks, leading to a V- or U-shaped economic recovery; where the disruptions remain for six to eight months, slowing demand and hitting industries; and the worst-case scenario, where it continues for a prolonged period. “I don’t think any of us really know yet which of those variations and hybrids of those scenarios will come into play,” he said. U.S. President Donald Trump said he will discuss a payroll tax cut with congressional Republicans on Tuesday as part of efforts to protect against the impact of the outbreak. Despite the expectation of more interest rate cuts, McKay said a fall into negative rates appears unlikely in the United States and Canada. There are “large questions about whether (negative rates) have been effective or not in the European experiment,” he said. “I get the sentiment from central bankers that we’d have to expend all coordinated fiscal and monetary stimulus down to zero before we’d consider negative rates.” (Reporting By Nichola Saminather Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Steve Orlofsky)"

-1.9558662395669946," RBC to cut Canada prime rate to 3.45%, rivals follow (Reuters) - Royal Bank of Canada RY.TO said on Wednesday it would cut its prime rate to 3.45% from 3.95% in its first reduction since July 2015, with the country's other lenders expected to follow suit, even as the moves weigh on margins already under pressure. Canada’s biggest lender announced the move, which will take effect on Thursday, after the Bank of Canada cut benchmark rates by 50 basis points on Wednesday to help tackle a coronavirus outbreak and said it was ready to cut again. Following suit, Bank of Nova Scotia BNS.TO, Toronto-Dominion Bank TD.To, Bank of Montreal BMO.TO and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) CM.TO also said they would cut the rate to 3.45%. The central bank’s cut is “well in advance of the banks’ expectations,” said Rob Colangelo, senior vice president for credit ratings at DBRS Morningstar. The Bank of Canada’s reduction, following a similar move by the U.S. Federal Reserve on Tuesday, will lead to margin compression at or slightly above the higher end of the 1-to-2 basis-point-per-quarter range expected by the banks at the end of fiscal 2019, Colangelo said. The last two times the Bank of Canada lowered rates, in January and July of 2015, the banks passed on only 30 basis points of the 50-basis-point cuts. But the major banks matched the central bank’s three quarter-percentage-point increases in 2018. “They’re choosing to err on the side of caution and put more stimulus into the economy,” said John Kinsey, portfolio manager at Caldwell Securities. “But it will squeeze them.” The economic growth spurred by the cut would improve loan growth, but it “likely won’t be enough to offset net interest margin compression,” said Laura Lau, chief investment officer at Brompton Group. Canadian banks are somewhat protected by their skew toward more fixed-rate loans, said Gabriel Dechaine, an analyst at National Bank Financial (NBF), contrary to the dominance of variable rates in the U.S. “It’s not an immediate hit when the central bank cuts,” Dechaine, who expects the cuts to result in a 1% to 2% reduction in his earnings estimates for the major banks. The decline in margins would be driven more by commercial loan portfolios, which price more frequently, Colangelo said. Banks have been growing their business loan books at double-digit rates recently. The Fed’s rate cut would weigh more on Canadian banks’ U.S. operations, Dechaine said in a note on Tuesday. Canadian banks experienced 43 basis points of average net interest margin compression following the Fed’s three rate cuts in 2019, he said. Canadian banks' earnings could fall by between 0.6% to 1.5% in the next two quarters, with the more U.S.-focused TD Bank TD.TO and Bank of Montreal BMO.TO taking the biggest hits, he said."

In separate statements of allegations, the Ontario Securities Commission (OSC) said this week that TD and Royal Bank of Canada had failed to have sufficient supervision and controls in their foreign exchange trading businesses from at least 2011 to 2013. “The settlement will send a clear message to firms about the importance of promoting a culture of compliance,” Cullen Price, Manager, Market Abuse Team, Enforcement at OSC said during TD’s hearing. The two banks allowed the inappropriate sharing of confidential customer information by traders at the banks with their counterparts at other firms, the OSC said in the statement of allegations. TD agreed to pay a combined C$10.1 million, split between fines to the commission and investigation cost, the OSC said. The total bill for RBC, Canada’s biggest bank, came to C$14.4 million. “TD takes its obligations to have sufficient controls in its business very seriously. It’s integral to its culture of serving customers efficiently. Bottom line is that TD’s controls on FX trading is quite different today than it was 6-8 years ago,” a TD representative told the hearing. Ahead of Friday’s settlement hearing, RBC said the bank was “pleased to resolve this matter in cooperation with the OSC. “The conduct covered by the allegations occurred many years ago, and we have taken a number of steps since that time to enhance our controls,” RBC said. Some of the world’s biggest investment banks have already paid more than $11 billion in fines to settle U.S., British and European regulatory allegations that traders rigged the currency markets. In May, the European Union fined Barclays, JP Morgan, Royal Bank of Scotland, Citigroup, and MUFG a combined 1.07 billion euros ($1.2 billion) for rigging the multi-trillion dollar foreign exchange market.

-2.603610063064311," Canada's RBC, TD Bank raise bad debt provisions as slowing economy bites (Reuters) - Royal Bank of Canada and Toronto-Dominion Bank, Canada’s two largest lenders, beat analysts’ estimates for quarterly profit on Thursday as strong loan growth boosted interest income, but a spike in provisions for soured loans spooked investors. Canadian lenders are faced with a sharply slowing economy, a cooling house market, with a record high household debt-to-income ratio stoking concerns of loan losses. Both banks posted double-digit growth in money set aside for such losses in the second quarter. On Wednesday, smaller rival Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce estimated zero earnings growth, sending its shares down for a second straight day on Thursday. “Last quarter’s higher provisions seemed to be an anomaly, but with Q2 also higher, we think it could be the beginning of an overall weakening,” Chris Kuiper, senior analyst at CFRA Research, said. “The first time, it was easy to give them a pass as a “one-off” but with the second quarter also showing higher provisions it seems like this is becoming more of a trend,” he added. RBC blamed losses in personal and commercial banking for a 55% rise in quarterly provisions. On a post-earnings call with analysts, bank executives said that some of their oil and gas clients had come under pressure due to a fall in crude prices. Provisions at TD rose 14% to $633 million from a year earlier due to increase in money set aside to meet future losses in the banks’ personal lending portfolios. RBC also said it expected net interest margin or NIM, a key measure of profitability, to be relatively flat over the next several quarters, given the outlook for interest rates. RBC shares were down 2.4%, while TD shares rose 2.2%, helped by a stronger earnings beat, and relative share price underperformance ahead of the earnings. The Canadian central bank and U.S. Federal Reserve have paused interest rate hikes after raising them multiple times since July 2017. In the reported quarter, higher rates in Canada and the United States helped improve NIMs at the banks, as they earned more from loans than they paid out on deposits. Total loans at RBC jumped 9% in the second quarter, while at TD, they rose 3%, with home, personal and business lending showing growth. CIBC, which is most exposed to Canadian economy, reported negligible quarterly loan growth on Wednesday. Residential mortgage loan growth has been a focus for investors following stringent regulatory changes that require borrowers of uninsured mortgages to be stress-tested to check their ability to repay. “Regulatory changes have helped some of Canada’s major housing markets stabilize, particularly in Ontario and to the East. Western Canadian markets remain under downward pressure,” said RBC Chief Executive David McKay. Loans grew not only in the domestic markets, but also in the United States, where both banks have sizeable businesses. “RBC is showing decent domestic loan growth and strong growth south of the border,” said John Aiken, an analyst with Barclays. At TD, “underlying retail loan growth remains strong on both sides of the border,” he added.

5.4139579808982115," RBC CEO says Canada losing some of its economic spark TORONTO (Reuters) - The chief executive of Royal Bank of Canada, the country’s biggest lender by market value, said on Thursday that Canada’s struggle to compete with global peers is hurting its ability to grow the economy. Canada, a G7 economy, has suffered in recent years from low productivity growth, lackluster foreign direct investment and difficulty in bringing oil, one of its major exports, to market due to a lack of pipeline capacity. The Liberal government, which faces a general election in October, has committed to major infrastructure investment and has allowed businesses to write off additional capital investments to make them more competitive, but has opted not to match aggressive tax cuts by the United States. “Our competitiveness is challenged. Our capacity to grow and advance our economy is stalling,” said RBC Chief Executive Dave McKay, in prepared remarks for shareholders at the company’s 150th annual meeting, in Halifax, Nova Scotia. “When I travel overseas, I often hear concerns from investors about Canada’s falling position in the world,” McKay said. RBC has a market capitalization of about C$149 billion ($111.70 billion), according to Refinitiv Eikon data. Data last month for the fourth quarter showed that Canada’s economy barely grew due to plunging Canadian crude oil export prices and that the labor productivity of Canadian businesses fell by 0.4 percent. Steps that Canada can take to improve its competitiveness include building digital and physical infrastructure, such as energy pipelines, McKay said. Due to a lack of pipeline capacity, the price of Canadian heavy crude fell last October to a discount of more than $50 a barrel below the benchmark for U.S. oil. A Canadian court last August overturned approval of the Trans Mountain oil pipeline expansion. The government has since bought the pipeline in an effort to save the project."

6.71581487164621," Instant View: Canada's economy posts 2.0 percent annualized growth in third quarter TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada’s economy grew at an annualized rate of 2.0 percent in the third quarter, in part due to higher export volumes and strength in mining and petroleum refineries, Statistics Canada said on Friday. Market reaction: CAD/ LINK: here “Two (percent) is sort of in line with estimates. ... A bit more worrying, though, is the monthly detail showing an unexpected decline in September, setting us up for a fairly weak fourth quarter situation being compounded by the postal strike and the fall-off in oil prices.” “In terms of impact on the Bank of Canada, the third quarter numbers would be in line with their forecast but a further weakening might be a bit less positive in terms of their outlook for the economy. However, I think it reinforces a gradual pace of tightening, dependent on the data and the extent of slowing that we see in the fourth quarter, and some sense of whether that slowing’s going to be sustained or whether it’s going to bounce back as we move into 2019.” “It is not a great batch of data. We did see a little bit more weakness from the oil patch in the September figures than we were expecting. We thought that would be more concentrated in October, so perhaps the negative print on the September industry level GDP number isn’t as negative as it looked at first glance.” At the same time, if you look at the Q3 data as a whole, we had a big drawdown in business investment, we did see the deceleration in consumption activity, it’s not a great mix of data.” “I do think if you are looking at this mix of data knowing that you are probably going to have a weak Q4, you do have to start asking questions about if the Bank of Canada is going to be able to throw caution to the wind a bit and lift rates in January or maybe they are going to want to wait a bit til March.” “The headline numbers are no surprise whatsoever. If anything, the quarterly number was a touch better than some expected, like the Bank of Canada.” “September surprised a bit by declining 0.1 percent, which doesn’t give us a very good lead in to the 4th quarter... It wasn’t a big surprise but there was some notable softness in domestic spending, especially in business investment. “I’d be shocked if the bank did anything with the rates next week... The issue is in January. The market is mostly assuming the bank will hike rates at that meeting. I continue to believe it’s a closer call than the market is priced for. Today’s news reinforces that message.”"

RBC lifted its net interest margin by 12 basis points over the course of 2018 to 2.77 percent and Chief Financial Officer Rod Bolger said it is forecasting an average 1-2 basis point rise in its NIM during each quarter next year, resulting in a 4-8 basis point improvement across the year. Bolger said that forecast takes into account increasing competition for deposits. Analysts have said an emerging price war between banks could crimp profits going forward. “Competition for deposits has always been strong,” Bolger said in an interview. “As rates increase, deposits become more valuable for both banks and consumers so I think it’s quite healthy that there’s deposit competition.” RBC reported a 13 percent increase in net income at its wealth management business to C$553 billion, reflecting higher average fees from clients. Net income from insurance rose 20 percent from a year ago to C$318 million. The bank’s investment banking business increased net income by 14 percent from a year ago to C$666 million, driven by beneficial U.S. tax reforms and higher trading revenue arising from market volatility. For the full year, RBC reported record net income of C$12.4 billion, up 8 percent on the year before."

2.207510687263153," Bank of Canada raises rates, might speed up pace of future hikes OTTAWA (Reuters) - The Bank of Canada on Wednesday raised interest rates as expected and said it might speed up the pace of future hikes given the economy was running at almost full capacity and did not need any stimulus. The central bank, which has now lifted rates five times since July 2017, also hailed the signing of a new North American trade pact it forecast would reduce economic uncertainty. The bank tweaked its standard language on future hikes, dropping previous references to a gradual pace of tightening. Senior officials said markets had misread the use of the word “gradual” to infer that the bank would only raise rates at every other scheduled meeting it holds to discuss policy. The bank announces rates eight times a year, on fixed dates. “It’s possible the pace could be a bit faster but it’s also possible it could be a bit slower,” the bank’s senior deputy governor Carolyn Wilkins told a news conference, saying future moves would depend heavily on economic data. The rate increase, by a quarter of a percentage point, took the bank’s overnight interest rate to 1.75 percent, still well below the “neutral” rate of 2.5 to 3.5 percent where monetary policy is neither stimulative nor accommodative. The bank, noting the U.S. economy was “especially robust,” boosted its estimate of third-quarter annualized Canadian economic growth to 1.8 percent from 1.5 percent. Growth in the fourth quarter should jump to 2.3 percent, it added. “The economy is running at its capacity and it is no longer needing stimulus. And so it’s our job to prevent the thing from overheating and creating inflation pressures down the road,” said Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz. The news helped push the Canadian dollar up to a one-week high of C$1.2969 to the U.S. dollar, or 77.11 U.S. cents, and opened the possibility of another hike on Dec. 5. “They are teeing up another run at it in December ... They are signaling a more urgent sense that they have to get up to neutral quicker than the markets were pricing,” said Derek Holt, senior vice president of capital markets economics at Scotiabank. Three major Canadian main street banks -- Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank and Bank of Montreal -- all quickly announced they were raising their prime lending rates to 3.95 percent from 3.70 percent. The central bank noted positive developments in two areas of potential risk. Trade uncertainty in North America will diminish after the United States, Canada and Mexico agreed on a new continental trade agreement on Sept. 30, it said. It also noted households were adjusting spending as expected in response to higher interest rates and housing market policies. The bank has long fretted about Canadians’ ability to cope with higher borrowing costs. On a more gloomy note, it said trade tensions between the United States and China were weighing on global growth and commodity markets and “could have a significant and lasting impact on the global economy.” The bank said overall inflation should drop in early 2019 as the effect of temporary factors fades and then remain at around 2.0 percent - the mid point of its 1 to 3 percent target range - through the end of 2020."

-14.146878767224822," Bank of Canada says it will continue to raise interest rates gradually OTTAWA (Reuters) - The Bank of Canada will continue to raise interest rates gradually, Governor Stephen Poloz said on Thursday, stressing that despite economic uncertainties, the bank did not want to let inflation momentum build. The central bank has raised rates four times since July 2017 and most market players expect another hike on Oct. 24. Poloz said that while the bank did not know exactly where the economy was heading, that did not justify inaction. “It does not mean keeping interest rates on hold until inflation momentum starts to build,” he said in a speech in Moncton, New Brunswick. “The bank will continue to follow a gradual approach to raising interest rates, and remain dependent on incoming data and other sources of information to guide our decisions,” the governor added. Market expectations of an interest rate hike in October, as reflected in the overnight index swaps market, rose slightly to 76.46 percent from 72.36 percent before the speech. [BOCWATCH] Although the annual inflation rate in August was 2.8 percent, well above the bank’s 2.0 percent target, Poloz said that was partly due to the boost provided by temporary factors such as higher gas prices. Poloz, who cited the inflation rate and very low unemployment, said in his speech that the economy was operating near capacity. “We know that if we move too slowly to raise interest rates, the economy could move firmly above its capacity limits and inflation could establish significant momentum. We certainly want to avoid this outcome,” he said. That said, new digital technologies could be giving the economy more room to grow before inflation pressure emerged. “Raising interest rates too quickly could choke off this economic growth unnecessarily,” Poloz continued. The bank left rates unchanged on Sept. 5 and Poloz said policy makers had pondered at the time whether the gradual approach to raising rates was still appropriate, given that its economic forecasts were on target. The bank discussed whether the data coming in as planned “was a reason for more moving more quickly ... and our conclusion was no, we still have a number of uncertainties we are carrying,” he told a news conference after the speech. One important unknown was the fate of talks to renegotiate NAFTA, he said. Talks on the pact have stalled. Poloz earlier told his audience that if the North American Free Trade Agreement were successfully renewed, investment spending should pick up, and that would “give us a longer period of non-inflationary growth.” Poloz - reiterating a point the bank made earlier this month - said if relations with the United States worsened and the economy slowed, that would not necessarily prompt a rate cut. If for example, Washington carried through on a threat to impose tariffs on Canadian autos and Canada retaliated, prices would rise, and that could be “very risky” for the inflation outlook at a time when the economy was at capacity. “If push comes to shove, our mandate is clear - it’s about inflation,” he said."

-8.137976836929825," Bank of Canada leaves rates unchanged; markets mull October hike OTTAWA (Reuters) - The Bank of Canada held interest rates steady on Wednesday as expected and said more hikes would be needed to keep inflation on target, boosting speculation it could tighten monetary policy next month. The overnight interest rate remains at 1.50 percent. The central bank, which maintains a 2 percent inflation target, has raised rates four times since July 2017 amid a strengthening economy. “Recent data reinforce Governing Council’s assessment that higher interest rates will be warranted to achieve the inflation target. We will continue to take a gradual approach, guided by incoming data,” the bank said in a statement, using language little changed from its last announcement on July 11. A Reuters poll of economists last week had predicted the central bank was likely to leave rates unchanged. The bank’s next fixed date for unveiling its decision on rates is Oct. 24. “This really does really leave the door open to October - we continue to look for a hike in October. Obviously, they are not going to pre-commit to it,” said Andrew Kelvin, senior rates strategist at TD Securities. The Canadian dollar initially gained slightly, touching C$1.3166 to the U.S. dollar, or 75.95 U.S. cents, before settling back to C$1.3185, or 75.84 U.S. cents. Although Canada’s annual inflation rate surged to 3.0 percent in July, its highest level in nearly seven years, the central bank said it should move back toward 2 percent in early 2019 as the effects of past increases in gasoline prices dissipated. “The bank is clearly keeping the door open for a rate hike in October, but not really overplaying its cards,” said Sal Guatieri, senior economist at BMO Capital Markets. Elevated trade tensions remained a key risk to the global outlook, the central bank said. Canadian and U.S. officials are meeting on Wednesday in a bid to settle disagreements holding up the renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement. The bank noted the strength of the U.S. economy, a factor of huge significance to Canada, which sends 75 percent of its goods exports to the United States. Data released on Wednesday by Statistics Canada showed Canada’s trade surplus with the United States hit C$5.3 billion ($4.0 billion) in July, the largest since October 2008. “It would have been difficult to justify a rate hike even if the economy warranted it today given the overhang of NAFTA uncertainty,” said Royce Mendes, senior economist at CIBC Capital Markets.

-9.738601037498151," UPDATE 3-RBC sees slowing mortgage growth due to tougher rules * CFO says bank on track to hit mortgage sales target * Retail head expects mortgage slowdown in second half * Q3 EPS C$2.14 vs forecast C$2.11 (Recasts, adds comments from conference call, interview) TORONTO, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Royal Bank of Canada expects its mortgage sales growth to slow in the second half as tougher lending rules introduced by Canada’s banking regulator take effect, the country’s biggest lender said on Wednesday. The Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI) introduced the measures to cut out risky lending, named “B-20”, at the start of the year, requiring borrowers to be tested on their ability to repay loans at 200 basis points above their current rate. RBC’s retail banking head Neil McLaughlin said mortgage sales had held up well in the year to date, benefiting in part from the completion of sales agreed as borrowers rushed to take loans before the rules were introduced, but would decline. “We’re benefiting right now from this pull-forward effect,” he told analysts on a conference call. “We do believe there will be a modest slowing, partly due to “B-20”, and in the back half of the year, we will see slowing growth.” In an interview, Chief Financial Officer Rod Bolger said that, even factoring in a slowdown, the bank remained on track to achieve its target of mid-single digit mortgage sales growth for the year. “Through three quarters we’re north of 6 percent,” Bolger said in an interview. “If it continues to lag down, we’ll still be above 5 percent for the full year.” Bolger said the bank was benefiting from an increased renewal rate, partly due to sales through an online app it launched to simplify the renewal process for existing customers. The new mortgage lending rules are part of a number of measures introduced by Canadian authorities to cool rampant housing markets in the cities of Toronto and Vancouver. “I think it’s been healthy,” said Bolger. RBC said earnings per share rose by 14 percent to C$2.10 in the quarter ended July 31. Excluding one-off items, earnings per share were C$2.14, ahead of the average forecast earnings of C$2.11 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Shares in RBC were up 0.6 percent at 11:10 a.m. ET (1510 GMT). Net income increased by 11 percent from a year ago to C$3.1 billion. That included an 8 percent rise in net income at the Canadian retail business to C$1.51 billion, which the bank said was driven by improved margins due to higher Canadian interest rates.

U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened to double down on import tariffs by hitting the sensitive auto industry, making it virtually impossible to renegotiate the 1994 NAFTA pact between the United States, Canada and Mexico. “I’m troubled by how events have spiralled to where they are today,” CEO Dave McKay told reporters after Canada’s biggest lender, which also has a substantial business in the United States, made a strategy presentation to investors on Wednesday. “I am incredibly frustrated that we are letting things get away from us,” McKay added. “I thought we would have had it resolved by now and moved on to other things.” McKay said that the Canadian government was right to believe that “no deal is better than a bad deal” but said he was still hopeful that a positive outcome will be achieved.

2.3178014004408243," Bank of Canada sees economy improving, plays down inflation risk OTTAWA (Reuters) - Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz on Monday gave an upbeat assessment of the economy’s prospects after a sluggish first quarter and said that while inflation this year would rise above the central bank’s target, it would be temporary. Poloz, in testimony to the House of Commons’ Finance Committee, reiterated that while higher interest rates would likely be warranted over time, some policy accommodation is still required to keep inflation on track. Pointing to the bank’s outlook for inflation of 2 percent two years from now, Poloz said policymakers are confident they have the right modeling and framework to guide interest rate decisions. “Given what our outlook is, we’ve got monetary conditions roughly where they should be, and in that context, the fact that inflation is rising above 2 (percent) for now is due to temporary factors and we can see through them,” he told the committee. The central bank held rates steady last week at 1.25 percent after hiking three times since last July, but said more interest rate hikes would be coming amid rising wage growth and inflation. Financial markets expect one or two more rate hikes this year from the bank BOCWATCH. Poloz said policymakers are watching wages, which he said will pick up as job vacancies continue to grow, and will in turn encourage more people to enter the workforce. “We are just now in the last six months reaching wage movements that are actually positive in real terms, above 2 percent. And so that’s a really important bridge to cross and when we get up to the 2.5-to-3-percent zone, then we have got more scope for getting faster reintegration of people back into the workforce,” he said. Poloz reiterated his expectation that business investment and export growth will soon contribute more to economic growth, which has until now mostly been driven by households and government spending. “I am hopeful that when we get past the bottlenecks that we saw during in the winter time, that we’ll get some clearing of inventory out and exports will rebound,” he said. The Canadian dollar, which hit a near three-week low on Monday at C$1.2858, steadied around C$1.2845 after Poloz’s remarks. Poloz over the weekend said he expects the inflation rate to be above the central bank’s two percent target in 2018, but he is comfortable with that as long as the long-term trend is steady, according to media reports published on Sunday."
