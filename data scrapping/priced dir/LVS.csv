13.124763949819304," Las Vegas Sands appoints Robert Goldstein as CEO (Reuters) - Las Vegas Sands Corp, the world’s largest casino company, on Tuesday named its long-time executive, Robert Goldstein, as chairman and chief executive officer. The appointment comes after American casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, who built lavish gambling palaces that made him one of the world’s richest men, died earlier this month at 87. Adelson was Las Vegas Sands’ chairman and chief executive officer since its inception in the late 1980s. Goldstein, who assumed the role of acting chairman and CEO on Jan. 7, joined Las Vegas Sands company in 1995 and became a member of its board in 2015. He has served as president and chief operating officer since January 2015. Goldstein has also held prominent roles at The Venetian and The Palazzo Las Vegas, two of the world’s best-known casinos on the Vegas gambling strip. Las Vegas Sands also named Patrick Dumont as president and chief operating officer, and appointed Randy Hyzak as its finance chief."
10.307416099591611," Sheldon Adelson, casino mogul who made big bets on Trump and Netanyahu, dies at 87 (Reuters) - Combative self-made billionaire Sheldon Adelson, who assembled the world’s largest casino empire and used his fortune to nurture conservative politicians and policies in the United States and Israel, has died at age 87. The American casino mogul, raised in a poor Jewish immigrant family in Boston as the son of a cab driver, established lavish hotels and casinos in Las Vegas, Macau and Singapore, and headed the world’s largest casino company, Las Vegas Sands Corp. Adelson’s wealth made him a formidable figure in American and Israel politics and in the news media. He was a vigorous supporter of U.S. President Donald Trump, former U.S. President George W. Bush and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as well as a prolific donor to U.S. Republican politicians and foe of Democrats, including former U.S. President Barack Obama. “He was an American patriot, a generous benefactor of charitable causes, and a strong supporter of Israel,” Bush said in a statement. Adelson died on Monday night from complications related to treatment for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, a cancer of the lymphatic system, Las Vegas Sands said in a statement on Tuesday. With a net worth of $33.4 billion as of this week, Adelson ranked as the world’s 38th richest person on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Known for his extensive philanthropy and business ventures in Israel and donations to Jewish causes, Adelson counted Netanyahu as a close friend. “Sheldon’s tremendous actions to strengthen Israel’s standing in the United States and the connection between Israel and the (Jewish) Diaspora will be remembered for generations,” Netanyahu said in a statement. Adelson and his Israeli-born physician wife Miriam gave more than $218 million to Republican and conservative causes in the 2020 U.S. election cycle, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks political spending, more than anyone else. They were prolific backers of Trump’s 2016 presidential bid and remained supportive throughout his turbulent presidency. The casino magnate was in regular contact with Trump after he took office and saw some of his cherished goals relating to Israel come to fruition including the moving of the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem in a break with decades of American policy. Adelson attended the embassy dedication ceremony in May 2018. “I’m against very wealthy people attempting to or influencing elections. But as long as it’s doable, I’m going to do it,” Adelson told Forbes magazine in 2012. Adelson, a college dropout, was short and stocky, had thinning red hair and in later years used a motorized scooter because of a medical condition that made it difficult to walk. But his appearance belied his clout and drive. His empire in the United States, Macau and Singapore was exemplified by the Venetian resort casino in Las Vegas, which boasted replicas of landmarks from Venice, Italy, like canals, the Rialto Bridge and the bell tower of St. Mark’s Basilica. He filled his gambling hubs with trendy restaurants and shops, making them luxury destinations for business travelers and tourists alike. In November 2018, Trump awarded Adelson’s wife the highest U.S. civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, a move critics assailed as a presidential “thank you” for the couple’s financial backing. During the White House ceremony, Trump hailed the Adelsons for protecting “the sacred heritage of the Jewish faith,” placed the medal around her neck and kissed her on both cheeks. “I know that a lot of people think that guys like me succeed by stepping on the broken backs of employees and other people, but they don’t understand that we, too, have philosophies and ideals that we adhere to very scrupulously,” Adelson said at a Las Vegas event in 2008, according to the New Yorker magazine. Adelson also backed Bush, who served eight years as president, then poured tens of millions of dollars into failed 2008 and 2012 efforts to defeat Obama. Adelson changed the Israeli media landscape in 2007 by launching Israel Hayom, a free right-wing daily newspaper that took a pro-Netanyahu line. Adelson wrote in his newspaper in 2012 that Netanyahu was not “my puppet.” He was responding to former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, who had accused Netanyahu of intervening in a U.S. election by opposing Obama “in the name of an American billionaire (Adelson) with a clear interest in the vote.” Although initially reluctant to donate to Trump’s presidential bid, he became a Trump backer even as some other wealthy Republican donors stayed away. Trump won his first major newspaper endorsement of the 2016 general election when the Adelson-owned Las Vegas Review-Journal supported him. Adelson and his family paid $140 million in December 2015 to buy the Review-Journal - the city’s most prominent newspaper - in a secret transaction. The purchase price reflected a 75% premium over what it had sold for nine months earlier. After the family’s ownership was revealed, a flood of reporters and editors left the newspaper. Detractors described Adelson - who engaged in a court battle with his own sons, feuds with former associates and lawsuits against journalists - as vengeful and mean. “Over time, I observed Mr. Adelson plot vendettas against anyone whom he believed stood in his way. However minuscule the perceived affront, he was certain to go ballistic, using his money and position to bully any ‘opponent’ - great or small - into submission,” Shelley Berkley, who worked for Adelson before serving from 1999 to 2013 as a Democratic U.S. congresswoman from Nevada, wrote in a Las Vegas newspaper in 1998. Adelson was born in Boston in 1933. At age 12, he began selling newspapers on street corners. By 16, he ran a candy vending-machine business. Earlier in his business career Adelson dabbled in entrepreneurial ventures before launching in 1979 a Las Vegas computer trade show that became the world’s biggest. He used its success as a springboard to buy the aging Las Vegas Sands Hotel, then built the largest privately owned U.S. convention center and later the Venetian. Macau, a former Portuguese colony Macau and Hong Kong neighbor known for gambling, reverted to Chinese rule in 1999. Foreign casino companies got their shot after a Hong Kong businessman’s Macau gambling monopoly ended. When China opened up Macau’s gambling sector to foreign casino operators in 2001, Adelson was the quickest off the mark, building Sands Macau and then resorts and a convention center on Macau’s Vegas style Cotai strip, ushering in an era of staggering growth. By 2004 Adelson opened his first casino and Macau later became the world’s top gambling center. Las Vegas Sands’ initial public offering in December 2004 made him a multibillionaire. Adelson has been credited with helping to broaden Macau’s appeal away from the hard-core gambling parlors that had flourished for decades under the monopoly of former gambling kingpin Stanley Ho. While visiting a Macau casino project in 2007, Adelson defended China’s communist rulers against critics of the Asian giant’s human rights record, including U.S. lawmakers. His domain also included the $6 billion Marina Bay Sands in Singapore, which opened in 2010, and a casino in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. After his first marriage ended, in 1991 Adelson married Miriam Ochshorn, a doctor who specialized in drug addiction treatment. One of Adelson’s sons from his previous marriage, Mitchell, died in 2005 at age 48 of a drug overdose."
1.5531165551228712," Las Vegas Sands mulling $6 billion sale of Vegas casinos - source (Reuters) - Casino operator Las Vegas Sands Corp is exploring a sale of its flagship casinos in Las Vegas for about $6 billion, a source told Reuters on Monday, with the move likely to mark the exit of the group’s chairman from the U.S. gambling industry for now. The properties included in the potential sale are Sands Expo Convention Center, the Venetian Resort Las Vegas and the Palazzo, the source added, asking not to be identified. A potential sale of the Las Vegas properties will concentrate the company’s casino portfolio entirely in Macau and Singapore. Bloomberg reported earlier that Las Vegas Sands is working with an adviser to solicit interest from potential suitors, with a company representative cited by the news outlet confirming there were early discussions about a sale and that nothing has been finalised. In May, Sands ended plans to open an integrated resort casino in Japan without providing a reason for the cancellation of the project. The gambling industry, which thrives on air travel and large groups of people in close proximity, is one of the hardest hit industries amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As of June 30, the company had $13.82 billion total outstanding debt, excluding finance leases. Chairman and chief executive of the group, Sheldon Adelson, said in the second quarter that a “recovery process from the COVID-19 pandemic in each of our markets is now under way.” The company reported a third-quarter loss of 74 cents on revenue of $586 million. Revenue fell 82% from a year earlier. In August, rating agency Fitch Ratings revised the outlook on the company to ‘negative’ from ‘stable’ due to market conditions brought about by the pandemic. Fitch had said back then that near-term prospects for the group’s business remained “dim” and “lackluster” in Las Vegas."

The government has authorised licences for three integrated resorts and has been expected to receive bids officially from interested cities in 2021. Potential bidders include Yokohama, Tokyo, Osaka - Japan’s three largest cities."
9.455203037154572," Las Vegas Sands scraps plans for Japan integrated resort casino project TOKYO (Reuters) - Las Vegas Sands LVS.N said it has ended plans to open an integrated resort (IR) casino in Japan, dealing another blow to Japan's attempts to energise its economy through tourism. Caesars Entertainment Corp and Wynn Resorts Ltd have also withdrawn from casino projects in Japan, which the government had hoped would sustain tourism after the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, now postponed due to the global coronavirus epidemic. Las Vegas Sands did not give a reason for the cancellation of the project. Only in January it sounded upbeat about Japan and put on magic shows and Broadway musical numbers to drum up enthusiasm for the industry at an exhibition in Yokohama. “The framework around the development of an IR has made our goals there unreachable,” Sands Chairman Sheldon Adelson said in the press release on Wednesday announcing the cancellation. “It is time for our company to focus our energy on other opportunities.” Japan wants to build several integrated resorts - Las Vegas-style complexes that include casinos, shopping arcades and conference centres - although a bribery scandal has hardened public opposition to the plans. The government has authorised licences for three integrated resorts and has been expected to receive bids officially from interested cities in 2021. Potential bidders include Yokohama, Tokyo, Osaka - Japan’s three largest cities. Analysts at Sanford Bernstein last year estimated Japan’s casino market would be worth $8 billion a year. Sands pulled out of bidding for a project in Osaka in 2019, turning its attention to Tokyo and Yokohama for an integrated resort that Adelson had estimated could cost $10 billion. “I think that is probably more Sands than Japan,” Mio Kato, the head of LightStream Research who publishes on the Smartkarma website, said about the cancellation. “They and most casino operators have been cutting their dividends and since most operators were already levered, the COVID crisis has made a complete mess of their balance sheets,” Kato added, referring to COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. At a third-quarter conference call, Sands President Robert Goldstein suggested that the high price of building in Japan was giving the company second thoughts. The cost of one resort in Japan would be the same as all of Sands casinos and malls in China, he said."
-4.319232529725211," 'I won't be alive to work' - Las Vegas union wants sick leave, quarantine pay (Reuters) - The winking airport slot machines that tell visitors they have arrived in Nevada’s Sin City are turned off and wrapped in police tape; the famed Las Vegas Strip is so empty a group of bicyclists zooms down the middle on a Friday night. Shutting down the businesses that make Las Vegas a multibillion-dollar gambling and entertainment hub has dealt a crushing blow to the state and idled tens of thousands of workers. But with a dozen members dead and others sickened, the powerful union representing Las Vegas’ bartenders and casino employees, Culinary Workers, is not pushing for a fast-reopening. Instead the union, which is influential with Democratic politicians who lead the swing state, is negotiating hard for safety measures and paid leave for workers sidelined by the virus. “If I go back too early, I won’t be able to be alive to work,” said Olee Stewart, 59, a cook at Harrah’s Las Vegas Hotel and Casino, who is a member of the union. “When it’s safe for everyone, I think we should go back.” The high-stakes negotiations between the 60,000-member Culinary Workers Local 226 and Nevada’s storied casinos echo talks taking place across the United States, as businesses, politicians and workers scramble to find a safe way to save lives without further destroying the U.S. economy. The Culinary Workers union is asking casinos to pay employees who are idled by the pandemic and provide six months’ worth of health coverage to those who are laid off, according to a list of eight negotiating points seen by Reuters. The union is also asking for paid sick leave and quarantine time to those who are ill or exposed to the virus. It wants enhanced cleaning for the casinos and training for employees who will have to use harsh chemical cleaners to sanitize gaming areas, guest rooms, kitchens and other areas. “It’s a very, very tough situation for these workers,” said Geoconda Arguello-Kline, secretary-treasurer of the Culinary Workers local. “They have fears of losing a family member, the fear of getting sick and over that you have to be worried about getting your bills paid.” Arguello-Kline stopped short of threatening employee walkouts that could disrupt reopening plans. The discussions in Las Vegas will likely leave the gambling hub - as with many parts of the country - a different place than before the virus hit, with Plexiglass separating dealers and players, and waiters possibly donning masks in restaurants. The tension between companies’ need to reopen shuttered plants and union concerns about safety are also playing out in other industries. President Donald Trump this week ordered meat-processing plants to stay open to protect food supplies, despite concerns about coronavirus outbreaks, drawing a backlash from unions that said at-risk workers required more protection. Ford Motor Co F.N on Thursday outlined safety measures to restart U.S. plants, following similar efforts by General Motors Co GM.N and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles FCHA.MIFCAU.N to convince leaders of the United Auto Workers union to send members back to work. Public health experts say it is far too soon to allow the kinds of mass gatherings that happen in a place like Las Vegas, where tourists jam casinos, restaurants and even the sidewalks. But the economic devastation wrought by public health orders closing businesses and forcing residents to shelter at home is also a powerful incentive to loosen the orders. In Nevada, nearly 350,000 people have filed for unemployment benefits since the shutdowns began - a quarter of the state’s workforce, said Stephen Miller, director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. The shutdowns and slow return of tourism after the casinos reopen could lead to losses of 20% of the Las Vegas metropolitan area’s gross domestic product, or more than $20 billion, Miller said. Democratic Governor Steve Sisolak has said casinos will likely not be allowed to welcome guests until the third or fourth phase of reopenings - which could be months away. One unionized company, Wynn Resorts WYNN.O, has agreed to its union's request to pay workers while the casinos are closed, the company confirmed. A non-union company, billionaire Sheldon Adelson's Las Vegas Sands Corp LVS.N, is also paying idled workers, spending $65 million per month in wages and other fixed costs at the Venetian and the Palazzo, spokesman Ron Reese said. But most others are not. MGM Resorts International MGM.N, which owns several unionized Las Vegas casino resorts including the MGM Grand and the Bellagio, paid workers for the first two weeks of the shutdown and has offered grants to employees to help pay for rent, groceries and utilities, the company said. In financial documents filed last week with federal regulators, the company said it was effectively generating no revenue from its properties and would cut planned capital expenditures in half. Sahara Las Vegas, another unionized property, is paying for employees’ healthcare premiums during the shutdown and has set up a fund to help those experiencing hardship, General Manager Paul Hobson said. Once the casinos do reopen, they may look very different. The Venetian is considering installing Plexiglass barriers to separate guests from clerks helping them check in to the hotel, Reese said. Likely plans also include spacing out chairs on the pool deck, limiting traffic in elevators and making hand sanitizer widely available, he said. Caesars Entertainment Corp CZR.O, which owns Caesars Palace, Harrah's and the Flamingo, would not comment on union negotiations, but said it would follow the lead of state officials about when to reopen. But Paula Larson-Schusster, a dealer and United Auto Workers member at the Flamingo, said plans to install Plexiglass barriers between dealers and players may not be enough. Players will still have to shove their chips beneath the Plexiglass to play - and they are really dirty, she said. “I’ve had people pick their nose and scratch their private parts and then they pick up the chips,” she said. “I’ve had people shoot NyQuil on the table because they’ve got the flu but since they’re in Vegas they’re going to play.”"
14.160373243002047," Las Vegas Sands predicts speedy recovery in Asia on pent-up gambling demand (Reuters) - Las Vegas Sands Corp LVS.N on Wednesday posted a first-quarter loss as the coronavirus kept consumers at bay, but the casino operator struck an optimistic note as pent-up demand for gambling pointed to a speedy recovery in Asia. Shares of the company were up nearly 7% in after-hours trading as the company signaled a quick recovery in Macau, Singapore and China as coronavirus-induced curbs are eased. The company expects gambling and visitation to pick up by late summer or early fall in Asia, given its past experience in dealing with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic and Swine Flu. “We hear anecdotally that people are really frustrated and want to go back to gambling in casinos,” a company executive said on a post earnings call. “The idea of a mask or social distancing or thermometer checks will not be difficult for local Singaporeans or Chinese. They will accept it, they will deal with it.” However, Las Vegas Sands said a U.S. recovery would be more “drastic and slower” but added it was seeing demand for group business in August and into the fall. The gambling industry, which thrives on air travel and large groups of people in close proximity, is one of the hardest hit as the world goes into lockdowns in its battle against the pandemic. Liquidity during the coronavirus crisis remained a bright spot for Las Vegas Sands, with the company pointing to a strong balance sheet that would allow it to tap growth opportunities in new markets. Revenue from the company’s main casino business plunged 55.8% to $1.18 billion in the first quarter. The Nevada governor has ordered all casinos and other nonessential businesses in the state to close for 30 days beginning March 18. He extended that order until April 30, and last week said he has no specific date for when nonessential businesses might be allowed to reopen. In March, gambling revenue fell 80% in Macau, the world’s biggest casino hub that accounts for more than 60% of the company’s revenue. The S&P 500 casinos and gaming index .SPLRCCCGL has lost 49% this year, compared to the 13.4% dip in the S&P 500 .SPX. Net loss attributable to Las Vegas Sands was $1 million in the quarter ended March 31, compared to a profit of $582 million a year ago. Net revenue plunged 51.1% to $1.78 billion."

14.136702649228708," Japan's Yokohama city joins race to host newly legalized casino TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s second-largest city, Yokohama, said on Thursday it would bid to host a casino resort, a newly legalized industry the government hopes will stimulate the economy and tourism. Yokohama, facing Tokyo Bay and located a short train ride from the capital, joins candidates such as Osaka, Nagasaki and Wakayama vying to host integrated resorts (IR) expected to attract more tourists and investment. Las Vegas Sands Corp LVS.N promptly announced interest in Yokohama, saying it would pursue IR development there or in the capital rather than in Osaka. Osaka has been particularly aggressive in courting casino development, but some gaming companies prefer a site in or near Tokyo. Las Vegas Sands considered Osaka but decided that “an investment in Tokyo or Yokohama gives us the best opportunity,” CEO Sheldon Adelson said in a statement. Japan is widely seen as a prize market for casino operators due to its affluent population of 128 million and proximity to Asia’s wealthy gamblers. The government is expected to allow casino resorts in three sites initially. Yokohama had long been undecided about a bid amid worries about addiction and crime. “We must look to Yokohama’s future, the 20-30 years ahead,” Mayor Fumiko Hayashi told a news conference streamed on the city government’s website, announcing the bid. “I’ve come to the conclusion that in order to achieve growth and development, we need IR.” Japanese lawmakers finished legalizing casinos last year after a series of controversial bills and years of debate, with opponents citing risks of increased gambling addiction and organized crime activity. Prolonged discussions meant no resorts will be open in time for the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, with the government yet to pick hosts and operators. But new casino resorts are expected to help Japan maintain growth in tourism and investment after the Summer Games are over. Some analysts have said the casino market could be worth around $20 billion a year, or even more when opened in three cities. Besides Las Vegas Sands, international gaming companies including Wynn Resorts Ltd WYNN.O, MGM Resorts International MGM.N and Caesars Entertainment Corp CZR.O are eyeing the market, and may have to battle to win operating rights."
