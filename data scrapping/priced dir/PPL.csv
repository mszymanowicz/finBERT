-6.835106971811703," Sale of U.S. utility PPL's British unit faces delay as Brexit looms: sources LONDON/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The sale of British power utility Western Power Distribution (WPD) faces delays to at least the first quarter of 2021, partly due to uncertainty over whether Britain will leave the European Union without a trade deal, sources close to the matter said. Current owner U.S. utility PPL Corp in August launched the sale of WPD, which has a regulatory asset value of 7.7 billion pounds ($10.1 billion) with the help of U.S. investment bank JP Morgan , to focus on its U.S. operations. Based on its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) at 1.25 billion pounds ($1.67 billion) for the financial year ended in March, WPD could fetch a valuation of up to 12 billion pounds. Despite PPL’s gauging the interest of European utilities and investment funds, the power group has attracted just a small number of potential bidders, the sources said. The next regulatory regime for Britain’s networks, which sets fixed investment returns for grid owners and will only be decided in 2021, has refrained some companies from expressing their interest, the sources said. Two consortia are now left in the race, they said. Investment and pension funds Global Infrastructure Partners, Brookfield Asset Management and CDPQ formed one, while the infrastructure investment arm of Australia’s Macquarie Group joined forces with Canada’s PSP Investments and Dutch pension fund APG, the sources said. PPL, Macquarie, CDPQ and Brookfield declined to comment. GIP, PSP and APG did not immediately reply to a request for comment. However, as Britain and the EU are in a last-ditch effort to agree terms to keep trade flowing without tariffs or quotas from the start of 2021, the sale has now stalled and will likely run into the first few months of next year, the sources said. WPD delivers electricity to about 8 million customers across central and southwest England, and south Wales, according to its website. ($1 = 0.7472 pounds)"
14.129924185766225," U.S. utility groups Avangrid and PPL hold merger talks: Financial Times (Reuters) - U.S. utility companies Avangrid Inc AGR.N and PPL Corporation PPL.N are in talks to combine their business, the Financial Times reported, citing people familiar with the matter. The report said it was unclear whether a deal would include an investment from Spanish utility Iberdrola IBE.MC, the world's biggest wind power producer, which owns more than 80% of Avangrid. The deal would be ranked as the biggest utility tie-up this year and could create one of the largest publicly traded utilities in the United States if it completes, the report said. Avangrid has a market cap of $15.41 billion, while PPL is worth about $22.7 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Avangrid, the third-biggest wind power provider in the United States, serves about 3.1 million customers in upstate New York and New England, while PPL covers 29 counties catering to 1.4 million customers. The companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment."
