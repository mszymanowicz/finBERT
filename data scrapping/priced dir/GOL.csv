The flights are being operated by Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes, Brazil’s largest airlines and one of Boeing’s biggest customers. The first flight took place between the Brazilian cities of Sao Paulo and Porto Alegre, according to data from FlightRadar24. On Wednesday, the flights restarted with little fanfare.

-37.61467889908257," Brazil airline Gol attempts again to absorb loyalty program Smiles SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil airline Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes on Monday presented a new proposal to absorb its loyalty program Smiles Fidelidade, a publicly traded company that the carrier has been trying to bring in-house for years. Gol owns more than half of Smiles and controls its board, but has faced stiff opposition from minority shareholders since it first proposed the merger in 2018. In recent years, Gol’s competitors, such as LATAM Airlines group and Avianca Holdings, have all absorbed their loyalty programs into their airlines. Under the new merger proposal, Smiles shareholders would receive 22.32 reais ($4.36) in cash or 0.825 preferred shares in Gol in exchange for each Smile share. They could also opt for a combination of both. The deal would value Smiles at about 2.8 billion reais, although the sum going to outside investors would only end up being about half of that figure, given Gol’s 53% stake in the company. Smiles shares rose more than 4% on the news to 22.72 reais, exceeding Gol’s proposed price. In recent years, Smiles has become a key source of liquidity for Gol, an airline that even before the coronavirus pandemic was posting recurring losses. By absorbing it, Gol would no longer have to split Smiles’s dividends with independent investors, an important source of funds as the airline weathers the coronavirus crisis. ($1 = 5.1204 reais)"
-10.599078341013826," Brazil ends Boeing 737 MAX ban, planes could fly by year-end RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - (This November 25 story officially corrects name of ANAC superintendent of airworthiness to Roberto José Honorato from José Roberto Honorato in paragraph six after spokeswoman initially provided the name as José Roberto Honorato) Brazilian aviation regulator ANAC on Wednesday lifted the grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX, following U.S. clearance of the jets for flight, after a redesign prompted by two fatal crashes that killed 346 people. On Tuesday, the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) set out conditions for putting the grounded jets back into service, including new training and updating MCAS software implicated in the crashes. Brazil’s top regulator said Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA, the only airline to operate the model in Brazil, is implementing the required measures to resume flights. Gol said last week it could resume flying Boeing 737 MAX jets by year-end. Some regulators have been waiting for EASA’s decision before lifting their own measures as the 20-month Boeing safety crisis tested confidence in U.S. aviation leadership. ANAC superintendent of airworthiness Roberto José Honorato said the Brazilian regulator would apply the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration’s (FAA) conditions for bringing the MAX back to service and downplayed differences between regulators. EASA differed from the FAA in saying pilots could stop a “stick shaker” alarm from vibrating if it went off accidentally, halting a distraction thought to have added to the problems of the two crews in handling the fatal flights. It also issued one temporary restriction on autopilot use, unlike the United States. “Those differences are not unusual, especially in a complex aircraft project like the 737 MAX,” he told Reuters. “We are not going to have differences to the FAA.” EASA represents the 27 European Union countries plus four other nations including Norway, which has 92 of the aircraft on order. Until Dec. 31, EASA also represents Britain, which left the EU bloc in January. Canada is expected to lift the ban as well, but uncertainty remains about China, the largest market for the jet and the first to ban it in March 2019. U.S. flights are due to resume on Dec. 29, while in Europe the formal ungrounding will take place from mid-January."

Gol faced a cash crunch at the end of August as the deadline neared to repay a $300 million loan that credit rating analysts said had a high risk of default. Gol said Thursday it had managed ""a full pay-down"" of the loan, which was secured by Delta Air Lines DAL.N. Last week, Reuters reported that Delta had actually helped Gol refinance the loan. In the month of August, excluding the repayment of its debt, Gol burned through 6 million reais per day, it said. As of the end of the month, it said it had a “total liquidity” of 2.1 billion reais, although it did not disclose how much of that was in readily available cash. Under its own metric, liquidity has fallen 46% since June, and 17% since July."

Delta confirmed the memo was sent to employees on Wednesday but declined to provide additional details. Gol said on Tuesday it had paid the $300 million debt, according to a securities filing, without providing details. The 2015 loan had included a guarantee from Delta which helped Gol get a better interest rate. “As part of the refinancing, Delta worked with Gol to replace the existing loan guarantee with a smaller loan secured with incremental collateral,” Delta said in the memo. It said the deal reduces its own financial exposure and provides additional security, while providing Gol more time to address its obligations during the coronavirus pandemic, which has decimated air travel across the globe. Delta and Gol ended their partnership earlier this year when the U.S. airline launched a joint venture with Chile-based LATAM LTM.SN, a deal it said in the memo will be crucial to rebuilding its network and restoring growth in the region when the travel recovery begins.

The so-called “going concern” warnings are used by independent auditors when, in their view, there is substantial risk that a company many not exist a year from now. Gol did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Gol rivals Avianca Holdings AVT_p.CN and LATAM Airlines Group LTM.SN have already received ""going concern"" warnings from their independent auditors. Avianca and LATAM, the region's two largest airlines, filed for bankruptcy protection in the United States last month. That auditors would say three of Latin America’s top airlines run a significant risk of disappearing underscores how the coronavirus crisis has hit carriers in the region harder than anywhere else in the world. To be sure, the region’s airlines were already weaker than their peers before the crisis hit. But the United States and some European nations have moved to bail out their airlines while Latin American governments have been reluctant to do the same. Brazil’s government has shown willingness to lend money, but airlines including Gol have balked at the conditions. Gol and state bank BNDES have been negotiating a loan for months now. Gol also said in its filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that auditors had raised issues with “the effectiveness” of Gol’s “internal control over financial reporting,” although it did not elaborate. Gol added it will not be able to file its 2019 annual report with the SEC for 15 days as it resolves these issues with its auditors."

98.83040935672514," Brazil's Gol values Boeing's 737 MAX compensation at up to $412 million SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil airline Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes GOLL4.SA said on Wednesday it will receive up to 2.4 billion reais ($412 million) from Boeing Co BA.N as compensation for the grounding of the 737 MAX plane, in a mix of cash and credits. The aircraft has not flown in more than a year because of two deadly crashes that forced regulators to scrutinize the safety of its design. The timing of the payments has become a lifeline for Gol, which, like its peers worldwide, is reeling from the coronavirus crisis. But the disclosure also provides a point of reference for what kind of compensation other airlines will be able to obtain. According to Gol, it has already received close to 500 million reais in cash. In addition, it stands to receive up to 1.9 billion reais in credits that can be applied to new aircraft acquisitions, used to reduce interest and depreciation expenses. That amount is the maximum and is subject to certain undisclosed conditions. Gol said it may receive less than that. Gol, Brazil’s largest airline, is one of Boeing’s biggest customers and had ordered more than 100 Boeing 737 MAX planes. Those orders have since been reduced and Gol said it will not make new aircraft payments to Boeing for the next two years. The company flies Boeing 737 planes exclusively, reflecting the business model of Southwest Airlines Co LUV.N, which has reached only a partial settlement with Boeing and said it would share $125 million with employees. In a securities filing, Gol said the coronavirus crisis caused an 80% decrease in revenue in April to 138 million reais. April was the first full month of travel restrictions around the world due to the pandemic, and Gol is one of the first airlines to report its impact. Gol shares, which are down 73% so far this year, were little changed in afternoon trading on the Sao Paulo stock exchange. The company says it has enough cash on hand to sustain operations at this rate for more than 10 months. Still, Gol said it is discussing additional financing of up to 1 billion reais with unnamed entities. Gol has also said in the past it is discussing financing with Brazil’s BNDES state bank of up to 3 billion reais. It is unclear if this is the same, or separate, source of financing."

-57.82928446414446," Brazil airline Gol's new offer for loyalty plan boosts shares SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian airline Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA GOLL4.SA made a fresh bid on Monday to take over its lucrative loyalty program, Smiles Fidelidade SA SMLS3.SA, lifting shares of both. Smiles jumped around 20% and Gol, the country’s biggest domestic airline, climbed nearly 4% as investors reckoned the more generous offer might convince minority shareholders. Gol already controls Smiles with a 53% stake and has been trying to buy the rest since October 2018, when it offered minority shareholders a share swap. On Monday, it made a revised offer of both cash and shares, at a premium of about 25% based on Friday closing prices. The premium has grown as Smiles shares have fallen to near their lowest level in four years. Gol’s first takeover bid had wiped out 40% of the loyalty program’s market cap and its weak 2020 forecasts sent shares tumbling further this month. “The no-deal situation created a corporate governance misalignment that was a major negative for the loyalty program,” BTG Pactual analyst Renato Mimica told clients in a note. Gol Chief Financial Officer Richard Lark told analysts in a conference call that the deal does not require regulatory approval and would boost the airline’s earnings per share by 0.40 reais next year. Under the new proposal, Smiles minority shareholders would receive, between cash and Gol shares, a value about 25% higher than the Friday closing price. Based on a higher valuation of the airline in Gol’s securities filing, Smiles shareholders would receive up to 41.74 reais per share, a 30% premium. Either way, the offer for Smiles values it well below what it was worth early last year. When Gol first proposed to buy out minority shareholders, Smiles shares were worth 48.26 reais. That’s partly because Gol has been struggling, having lost some 9 billion reais ($2 billion) since 2008. Gol has not been paying dividends, but Smiles has been paying out to both the airline and minority shareholders. Gol has also said Smiles’ current level of profitability is unsustainable in the long term. Gol's two closest competitors, LATAM Airlines Group LTM.SN and Azul SA AZUL.N, do not have separately listed loyalty programs. LATAM concluded the repurchase of its Multiplus program earlier this year. Talks between Gol and Smiles over the initial proposed deal collapsed in June."

Gol flies Boeing 737 planes exclusively, a strategy which can help to reduce costs. But this year it has exposed the company to Boeing’s woes, including the worldwide grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX, following two deadly crashes. The carrier says it expects its seven MAX planes will receive regulatory approval to resume flights in December, based on the guidance it has received from Boeing. U.S. carriers do not expect to fly the MAX until 2020, according to their schedules. The Boeing fleet problems have reduced the benefit Gol received following the collapse of rival Avianca Brasil, following a failed bankruptcy restructuring. This has left Brazil’s domestic market with just three airlines. Gol said it had record revenues of 3.7 billion in the quarter but also reduced its profit forecast for the year to 0.90 reais per share, compared to a previous range of being 1.40 and 1.70 reais per share. In addition to the MAX groundings that began in March, Gol has also had to ground 11 older 737 NG planes because it discovered cracks on what is known as the “pickle fork” which attaches the fuselage to the wings. Those planes will be grounded for 45 days and the groundings began in early October, Gol said. The airline said it expects to have a fleet of about 126 planes by the end of the year. About 15% of its current fleet is grounded at the moment."

60.947869521554864," Gol, LATAM bids for Avianca Brasil assets may hit antitrust snag SAO PAULO (Reuters) - A new plan by cash-strapped carrier Avianca Brasil to sell its most coveted airport slots to Brazil’s two largest airlines will draw intense antitrust scrutiny, which may delay or derail a pressing cash injection. Antitrust regulator CADE said on Friday that it could block the plan, which Avianca Brasil hopes could raise some $210 million later this month. The airline filed for bankruptcy protection in December. Under the plan, Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA and LATAM Airlines Group would buy Avianca Brasil’s airport rights, known as slots, in three high-traffic terminals in Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Gol and LATAM already control over two-thirds of the slots in each of those three airports. Representatives for LATAM, Avianca Brasil and Gol did not respond to requests for comment. Avianca Brasil’s plan would raise much-needed funds but is high-risk, lawyers said, and could leave it hanging without quick cash. Creditors will vote later on Friday whether to approve the plan which would allow Gol and LATAM to bid on the assets. Avianca Brasil would not receive any funds until CADE greenlights the operation, said antitrust lawyer Tatiana Lins Cruz in an interview on Thursday. She said CADE could take up to eight months to analyze a case in which buyers already control more than 20 percent of a given market. Meanwhile, the airline would have to continue operations with its own money. But Avianca Brasil has been so cash-strapped that it fell behind its payroll in March. A person familiar with LATAM’s thinking said the airlines hoped CADE would approve the deals because they only involve a modest increase in their presence at Brazil’s busiest airports. The new plan is a setback for rival Azul SA, which ranks as Brazil’s third largest airline and has a small presence in those three airports. In Sao Paulo’s domestic Congonhas airport, Gol and LATAM already control a combined 92 percent of the slots, whereas Azul has just 3 percent. Azul had struck a preliminary deal with Avianca Brasil to take over the slots for $105 million and had already provided some $8 million so the carrier could meet its March payroll. But that deal was off once Gol and LATAM came in. CADE appeared to take a more positive view of an Azul takeover on Friday. “A scenario where Azul becomes the buyer represents a lower antitrust concern than in a scenario with LATAM or Gol,” the regulator said in its report. The plan could also draw scrutiny from Brazil’s civil aviation regulator, because airport slots are not meant to be bought and sold. Azul was planning to buy Avianca Brasil’s assets as a single airline, but the new plan would create seven different companies, each holding little more than slots. “In our view, it is not clear whether the Brazilian Civil Aviation Agency (ANAC) will approve this new structure,” wrote analysts at Brazil bank Bradesco BBI in a note to clients."
60.947869521554864," Gol, LATAM plans to buy Avianca Brasil assets worry antitrust regulator SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil’s antitrust regulator said on Friday that a plan announced by the country’s top two airlines, Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentess and LATAM Airlines, to acquire some of competitor Avianca Brasil’s airport slots could run afoul of antitrust laws. Avianca Brasil is going through bankruptcy and plans to auction some of its most coveted airport slots this month. Smaller competitor Azul SA had planned to acquire the assets but the deal fell apart. A potential acquisition by Azul would be less worrying on antitrust grounds, the anti-trust regulator Cade said."
37.870429647189425," Bankrupt Avianca Brasil lures Gol, LATAM bids, Azul role uncertain SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian airline Avianca Brasil plans to split into seven units that it will auction off separately, with rivals LATAM Airlines and Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes both planning to bid for some of those parts in a bankruptcy auction. The plan to split up the carrier, filed in a Brazilian court on Wednesday, is a significant departure from a previous proposal and adds fresh competition for some of the most-coveted airport slots in Brazil. But it also shuts the door on a previous offer by competitor Azul SA. Azul signed a preliminary agreement this month to pay at least $105 million for a selection of Avianca Brasil’s assets, a proposal that had been considered a coup by analysts who saw it as a way for Azul to challenge its bigger competitors: LATAM and Gol. Azul also last month gave Avianca Brasil a much-needed cash injection of 31.6 million reais ($8.21 million) after it fell behind on its payroll. But Avianca Brasil’s new plan involves dividing up the assets Azul sought, which include airport slots and its loyalty mileage program, into multiple new companies. Gol and LATAM are now offering at least $70 million each, and both said their bids had been requested by Avianca Brasil’s largest creditor, hedge fund Elliott Management. A person involved in the bankruptcy proceedings said last week that disagreements had emerged between Azul and creditors that threatened to derail the initial $105 million offer. Azul declined to comment on the status of its potential bid. To be sure, Azul could still bid, but not under its initial proposal, which had also included taking over many of Avianca’s aircraft leases. Azul Chief Executive Officer John Rodgerson told Reuters in March that he thought it was unlikely that LATAM or Gol could bid for Avianca Brasil, due to potential antitrust issues. But splitting up Avianca Brasil into smaller chunks could help those carriers carve up desirable airport slots and avoid antitrust troubles. Avianca Brasil, the country’s fourth-largest airline, filed for bankruptcy in December after falling behind on payments to aircraft lessors. Despite the lack of payments, Brazilian judges have repeatedly allowed the struggling carrier to keep flying its planes."

-10.05212012390864," UPDATE 1-Brazil airline Gol sees wider 2018 loss, 2019 recovery (Recasts with earnings projections) SAO PAULO/BRASILIA, Jan 11 (Reuters) - Brazil’s largest airline, Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA, on Friday forecast 2018 losses at least 45 percent larger than previously forecast, adding that it expects to restore profitability this year by a wider-than-expected margin. Gol and its competitors struggled during the first three quarters of 2018 due to weak emerging market currencies and high oil prices. That trend, however, reversed in the fourth quarter of the year, for which results have yet to be officially posted. Gol now expects losses of between $1.60 and $1.80 per share, up from a prior forecast for a $1.10 per share loss, it said in a securities filing. Gol reported a net loss of more than $350 million for the first nine months of 2018. For 2019, as prices of oil have fallen and Brazil’s real currency has appreciated, Gol is now forecasting profits of between $1.20 and $1.40 per share, compared to a previous projection of between $0.80 and $1.20 per share traded on the New York Stock Exchange. Gol’s shares also trade on Brazil’s Bovespa index. The airline also raised its projections for debt levels for 2018 and 2019.

In a securities filing on Wednesday, Gol said the decision to execute sale and leaseback agreements with investment firms Castlelake and Apollo Aviation comes during a favorable time for selling NGs. Under the plan, 13 NGs will be returned upon receipt of the more fuel-efficient 737 MAX-8 jets, which will make up the backbone of the Brazilian carrier’s fleet. Gol’s planned capacity will not change as a result of the renewal plan, it said. “These monetizations of our 737-800 NGs permit Gol to accelerate reduction of balance sheet leverage and increase liquidity,” Richard Lark, Gol’s chief financial officer, said in the filing. The move will reduce the company’s net debt by approximately 1.1 billion reais ($280.48 million), it said. (Reporting by Ana Mano in Sao Paulo and Tracy Rucinski in Chicago Editing by Matthew Lewis)"

Shares in Gol were up 2.3 percent and shares in Smiles 3.5 percent after Gol said the Brazilian stock exchange decided the structure proposed by Gol to take over its subsidiary could not be approved. Gol wanted to list its shares in a segment of the stock exchange with increased governance rules, where Smiles is already listed, and pay Smiles shareholders with these shares, but the proposal was rejected. The deal would be paid with Gol shares and an unspecified amount of cash. Shareholders had criticized the structure because holders of the new Gol stock would only hold non-voting shares in the airline and in the mileage company. Analysts at XP Investimentos said the B3 rejection complicates the proposed Gol reorganization, but said a presidential decree allowing foreign ownership of Brazilian airlines may present “new alternatives” for Gol to proceed with the intended takeover. Analysts at Itau BBA said investors may view the announcement as a positive for Smiles shareholders. Analysts said that permission by the Brazilian government would allow Gol to negotiate other options, and potentially ways to fund the take over of the subsidiary. Since the transaction was announced in October, Smiles shares have fallen 15 percent and Gol stock has jumped almost 75 percent. In the first day, Smiles shares fell 40 percent. In a securities filing, Gol also said it would weigh options considering the presidential decree allowing foreign companies to own up to 100 percent of Brazilian airlines.

27.117106921344526," Brazil airline Gol's talks on Smiles takeover seen taking 3 months -exec SAO PAULO, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Talks between Brazilian airline Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA and shareholders of its loyalty program Smiles Fidelidade SA on the terms of the carrier’s deal to take full ownership of Smiles could take up to three months, an executive said. “We expect three months to wrap up talks on the deal terms,” Smiles investor relations director Marcos Pinheiro said on Wednesday in a phone interview. Gol announced in October that it would buy out minority shareholders of Smiles and delist the subsidiary, following in the footsteps of its rival Latam Airlines Group, which had announced a similar deal with its loyalty program Multiplus. While Latam offered to pay shareholders in cash with a premium, Gol said the deal would be paid in a mix of cash and shares. The October announcement prompted shares in Smiles to fall by almost 40 percent in a day. Shareholders in Smiles have complained their voting rights would be reduced. In an interview with Reuters earlier this month, Gol CFO Richard Lark defended the deal as necessary to avoid being put at a competitive disadvantage. Smiles said on Wednesday that it had appointed the members of a committee that will eventually set the terms for the deal. Two of the committee members, Ana Novaes and Jose Luiz Osorio, are former directors of Brazil’s securities industry watchdog CVM. The other member is Jose Monforte, an executive who has worked in corporate governance institutions. Pinheiro said the committee aims to set “fair” terms for Smiles shareholders in the deal.

43.002780841853514," Brazil carrier Gol says country's foreign ownership ban is outdated NEW YORK, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Decades-old regulations barring foreigners from owning Brazil’s airlines are outdated and “might make no sense anymore,” the top executive of Brazil’s largest airline, Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA, said on Wednesday. Foreigners are limited by law to a 20 percent stake in any Brazilian airline’s voting stock. But while Brazil may be entering an economic liberalization phase - far-right President-elect Jair Bolsonaro has vowed to cut spending and privatize state companies - Gol Chief Executive Officer Paulo Kakinoff said it is unclear whether the new administration will seek to loosen the existing regulations. “Our company has always been in favor of bringing to our country all the conditions to have access to foreign capital without any kind of restriction,” Kakinoff told Reuters in an interview. “This should be one of the positive effects of having some change in the current legislation.” Outgoing President Michel Temer has said he is in favor of allowing full foreign ownership. In 2017, he said he would enact this change through executive action, only to change his mind and submit a bill to Congress, where the plan has stalled. Kakinoff added that Gol is not currently in talks with Delta Air Lines Inc, which owns a 9.5 percent stake in Gol preferred shares, or any other entity, about taking a bigger stake in the Brazilian carrier. In October, Gol said it planned to acquire full control of its listed loyalty program, a subsidiary called Smiles Fidelidade SA. Gol’s stock surged in response, while Smiles’ plummeted almost 40 percent in one day. Gol Chief Financial Officer Richard Lark said the airline needed to incorporate Smiles to avoid “competitive disadvantages,” especially with its largest local rival, Latam Airlines Group SA, which earlier this year decided to gobble up its loyalty program company, called Multiplus SA. A key difference in the transactions, however, is that Latam offered cash to investors, while Gol is offering only its own preferred stock, with the exchange ratio yet to be defined. Some minority shareholders have criticized the transaction, saying they will lose voter rights if their Smiles shares are exchanged for Gol shares, a charge the airline disputes. “Although the company owns preferred shares in the operational company, decisions about the airline and the loyalty program will continue to be taken at the board of Gol. It won’t be a shell company,” Lark said. (Additional reporting by Marcelo Rochabrun; Editing by Dan Grebler)"

31.44230489040908," UPDATE 2-Brazilian airline Gol posts steep loss on oil prices, currency (Adds details from call with analysts) SAO PAULO, Nov 1 (Reuters) - Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA (Gol), Brazil’s largest airline, reported a third-quarter net loss of 409 million reais ($110 million) on Thursday, due to a depreciating local currency and higher oil prices. The loss was much deeper than a forecast by three analysts for a net loss of $33 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv, and prompted Gol to revise down its estimates for the entire year. The company now expects shareholders to lose between 1.8 and 2 reais per share in 2018, compared with a previous estimated loss of between 1 and 1.2 reais per share. In the third quarter, usually profitable for Brazilian airlines, Gol reversed the net 328 million reais profit it earned in the same period last year. Gol is particularly sensitive to currency fluctuations because 77 percent of the airline’s debt is in dollars. Foreign exchange swings also affect the purchasing power of Brazilians and the cost of buying oil, priced in U.S. dollars. At the current exchange rate, Gol’s total debt amounts to 8 billion reais. Gol Chief Financial Officer Richard Lark said in a call with analysts that the airline predicted the real would appreciate in 2019. According to 30 estimates in Reuters poll published on Wednesday, the real is likely to weaken slightly. Overall for 2018, the company expects that the depreciation of the real will cost the airline 600 million reais in losses. Still, the company brought in higher revenue in the quarter than in 2017. Of Gol’s 2.8 billion reais in revenue, 37 percent went towards the cost of fuel, against 26 percent in 2017. In the nine months so far this year, Gol has posted an accumulated loss of 1.6 billion reais."

Smiles shares slumped 40 percent on Monday after the buyout was announced, with minority holders facing the uncertainty of being forced to accept a yet-to-be determined price. They traded slightly up on Wednesday at 34.52 reais. Smiles is listed on the Bovespa exchange’s Novo Mercado segment, which bars listing preferred shares with no voting rights and reserving voting shares for controlling shareholders. Under the deal structure devised by Gol, whose voting shares are all controlled by the family of Gol founder Constantino de Oliveira Junior through an investment vehicle called Volluto, the airline’s stock will shift to the Novo Mercado segment. Companies listed on the Novo Mercado segment can only be taken over via a share swap by other members listed on the segment or in a cash deal. Gol’s current capital structure is partly to comply with Brazilian law that bars foreign ownership of airlines. Outside of the family-controlled shares, other stakes, including Delta Airlines Inc’s, are held via non-voting preferred shares. Delta has 12.3 percent of preferred shares and 9.44 percent of Gol’s capital. Companies listed elsewhere on the Bovespa must buy out minority investors of companies listed in Novo Mercado with cash, as happened with rival loyalty program Multiplus, a transaction that would have been tough for Gol, which has 600 million reais ($161.38 million) in cash and net adjusted debt of 12.1 billion reais. Smiles has a current market value of 3.9 billion reais. The Novo Mercado-listed Gol will formally give voting rights to all shareholders, but the only asset owned by the company will be preferred shares in GLA, Gol’s operational company that will control the airline and Smiles. In the filing, Gol said the common shares will be owned by the Constantino family to comply with Brazilian law forbidding foreign ownership of airlines. The change will be a downgrade for Smiles shareholders, who today have shares in the loyalty program operating company and a say in management decisions. One Smiles shareholder, who asked for anonymity due to the sensitivity of the issue, said such a structure is unheard of and shareholders may question it with the regulator. “Novo Mercado was supposed to have an enhanced corporate governance,” he said. Other shareholders who also asked for anonymity criticized Smiles’ decision in March to cut its dividend to 25 percent of profits from a former level of 100 percent. At the time, analysts said the decision would strengthen Gol’s liquidity. Since then, Smiles’ shares have fallen nearly 60 percent, including Monday’s drop, and some shareholders are questioning how the recent declines will affect the combined cash-and-share buyout price for Smiles.

75.00000672161362," UPDATE 4-Gol buyout plan wipes 39 pct off Smiles market cap, prompts Brazil inquiry (Recasts with regulatory inquiry, comments from executives and fund managers, details of proposal) SAO PAULO, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Brazilian airline Gol Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes SA on Monday announced a plan to buy out minority shareholders in its loyalty program Smiles Fidelidade SA for an undisclosed price, battering the unit’s shares and prompting regulatory scrutiny. Gol said the plan was aimed at cutting costs, improving corporate governance, and removing the pressure of unrealistic analyst forecasts from the loyalty program, in which Brazil’s biggest domestic carrier still holds a 53 percent stake. But the lack of a buyout price in the announcement, and concerns that Gol could force the deal through over resistance from minority investors, sent Smiles shares diving 39 percent. That wiped out nearly 2.5 billion reais ($669 million) of market capitalization in the session. “While this might sound like bad news, the reality is we are coming to the table to negotiate a fair deal for everyone,” Gol’s Chief Financial Officer Richard Lark told investors on a conference call. Brazilian securities regulator CVM opened a formal analysis of the proposal, the agency said after markets closed on Monday. Gol’s move to delist Smiles, just five years after joining a wave of loyalty program IPOs, followed a similar decision by rival Latam Airlines Group SA this year to take miles plan Multiplus private, citing competitive pressures. However, in announcing its intentions, Chile-based Latam offered a nearly 12 percent premium for Multiplus shares, sending the stock higher on the day of the news. Gol said it had asked Smiles to set up “an independent special committee” with which it would negotiate the terms of the transaction to then be submitted “where applicable” to shareholders of Gol and Smiles. The airline also announced that its operational contracts with the loyalty program will not be renewed in 2032. Itaú BBA analysts said in a note that the announcement was negative news for Smiles shareholders. As recently as Sept. 20, Itau BBA had said it saw a “low probability” of Gol failing to renew its contract with Smiles. Last year, Air Canada, which had sold its Aeroplan loyalty program to data analytics firm Aimia Inc, said it would not renew its operating agreement with the company, hammering Aimia shares. The airline eventually partnered with Visa on an offer to buy back Aeroplan. In the case of Smiles, however, fund managers told Reuters that Gol could try to use its role as controlling shareholder of the loyalty program to push a deal through, leaving minority shareholders with little recourse. The investors requested anonymity due to the sensitivity of upcoming negotiations. “I want to make it very clear that the public tender offer is not our goal,” said Gol Chief Executive Paulo Kakinoff. Gol said the buyout and related restructuring would pave the way for the airline to migrate its shares to the Novo Mercado segment of the São Paulo stock exchange, which requires higher standards of corporate governance. Delta Air Lines Inc has a 9.0 percent stake in Gol, which has been particularly hard hit among Latin American airlines this year by the poor performance of local currencies, which account for the bulk of its revenue. At its peak, Smiles stock more than tripled from its 2013 IPO and 11 out of 12 analysts recommended it as of September, according to Refinitiv data. Gol CFO Lark said analysts had created undue expectations for the financial success of Smiles which was one reason for the proposed restructuring. Lark said that many research notes on Smiles assumed its revenue would continue to grow by double digits annually. “That happened for a while but we don’t think it can continue in the future,” Lark said."

75.00000672161362," Brazil's Gol to incorporate mileage subsidiary Smiles in restructuring SAO PAULO, Oct 15 (Reuters) - Brazil’s Gol Linhas Aéreas Inteligentes SA plans to fully incorporate its mileage subsidiary Smiles Fidelidade SA as part of a major corporate restructuring, the airline said in a securities filing on Monday. The restructuring, which must be approved by shareholder assemblies of both companies, would eventually pave the way for Gol to migrate its shares to the Novo Mercado segment of the São Paulo Stock Exchange. If the plan is not approved, Gol could pursue a different strategy, such as delisting Smiles through a mandatory buyout offer to the subsidiary shareholders, the filing said.

70.01302706473759," UPDATE 1-Brazil airline Gol eyes international routes to raise margins -paper (Adds information from newspaper interview with CEO) SAO PAULO, Oct 8 (Reuters) - Brazilian airline Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA is looking to boost its international business and reduce fuel consumption to counter a weak local currency and fuel prices that likely took a chunk out of its third-quarter margins. In an interview with Brazilian newspaper Valor Economico, Chief Executive Paulo Kakinoff said the carrier would increase the number of seats it offers internationally by 40 percent in 2019, while domestic seating would grow by only 3 percent. As part of that strategy, the company is betting on the Boeing 737 Max-8 long-range airplane, which consumes 15 percent less fuel than Gol’s current fleet, he said. Kakinoff’s comments came as the airline said in a Monday securities filing previewing quarterly results that it was likely to report an operating margin, or EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) margin, of 5 percent to 5.5 percent in the third quarter, down 7 percentage points from the same period last year. The company has been hit hard by rising fuel prices and a serious depreciation of the Brazilian real currency . Increased international flights could decrease the percentage of revenue collected in reais, mitigating the negative impact of currency fluctuations on Gol’s bottom line. Gol will launch at least one new international destination every quarter until 2021, Kakinoff said. This week, Gol will receive its third Boeing 737 Max-8, and 70 percent to 80 percent of the planes’ flights will be international, he added. In the Monday securities filing, Gol said operating cash flow in the quarter will likely come to 450 million reais ($117 million) to 500 million reais."

52.60197716953814," UPDATE 4-Brazilian airline Gol says demand holding up as loss widens (Adds shares, analyst comment) SAO PAULO, Aug 2 (Reuters) - Brazilian airline Gol Linhas Aereas Inteligentes SA reported a wider-than-expected quarterly loss on Thursday, but said that demand from both domestic and international customers remained strong. Gol reported a net loss of 1.326 billion reais ($354 million) in the second quarter, compared to a forecast loss of $125 million, according to a Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S poll. The airline had posted a net loss of 477 million reais a year earlier. Turnaround efforts were overwhelmed by higher fuel costs and a significant depreciation of Brazil’s currency. “In 2018, the traditional low season in Brazilian air travel was particularly challenging due to accelerated appreciation of the U.S. dollar against the real, and industry-wide supply disruption that affected demand for air travel,” Chief Executive Paulo Kakinoff said in the statement. Despite headwinds from the weak real, higher oil prices, and a truck drivers’ strike in May, the company’s margins had improved, said Banco Santander’s investment banking division in a note to clients, adding that it saw the results as “relatively positive.” The stock rose 0.5 percent on Thursday afternoon, after dropping more than 2 percent immediately after the results were released. The airline, Brazil’s largest, also revised its earnings per share estimate for the year to a loss of about 1 real per share, down from an expected profit of about 1 real per share last quarter. But in a post-earnings conference call with analysts, Kakinoff and Chief Financial Officer Richard Lark said that demand for Gol flights remained high. A weakening Brazilian real pushes up the cost of fuel, which is priced in dollars, while driving up the cost of repaying foreign debt and discouraging Brazilians from traveling abroad. Gol attributed 1 billion reais in losses to the weakening real. The company slashed its foreign flights by about 15 percent in May and June from a year before. Occupancy on remaining international flights fell, although Lark said on the call that international demand remained “pretty solid.” Fuel consumed 34 percent of Gol’s revenue in the second quarter, up from 29 percent a year earlier. In their forward-looking guidance, Gol said it expects fuel costs to remain flat for 2019. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) rose 47.3 percent from a year earlier to 208 million reais.
