Suncor, Canada’s second-largest oil producer, is taking part in the pilot project led by Creative Destruction Lab, a Toronto-based nonprofit organization, along with 11 other companies across the country. The aim is to develop rapid screening for asymptomatic staff suitable for workplaces nationwide in order to help reopen the economy. “This is a win-win. It will help protect hundreds of workers at one of the largest work sites in the province, and support research that will help us understand the best way to use rapid tests in workplaces as well as other settings,” Alberta Health Minister Tyler Shandro told a news conference. The western Canadian province is also developing rapid screening programs for asymptomatic people in correctional facilities, shelters and schools, he added. Alberta has provided 7,000 rapid tests. The pilot will test 200 workers at Suncor’s oil sands base plant near Fort McMurray and 125 staff in Fort McKay twice a week for 10 weeks. Suncor executive Dennis Banks said screening began a few weeks ago and there had so far been no positive test results. “This is one more layer of protection for our workforce and communities near our operations,” Banks said. “We look forward to scaling and extending rapid testing in other locations.” The Alberta government also said it would provide rapid tests to operators of all long-term care and supportive-living facilities in the province to routinely screen their asymptomatic staff. Alberta has 6,196 active COVID-19 cases and 432 people in hospitals as a result of the virus. The province has registered a total of 125,326 cases and 1,710 deaths.

13.257968432035055," Biden revokes KXL permit in blow to Canada's oil sector, Ottawa disappointed CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - U.S. President Joe Biden on Wednesday formally revoked the permit needed to build the Keystone XL oil pipeline (KXL), dashing Ottawa’s hopes of salvaging the $8 billion project that the struggling Canadian crude sector has long supported. The move represents another set-back for the beleaguered Canadian oil industry, in particular its energy heartland Alberta, kills thousands of jobs, and marks an early bump in Biden’s relationship with Canada, a key trading partner. Keystone XL, owned by TC Energy Corp, is already under construction in Canada, and would carry 830,000 barrels per day of Alberta oil sands crude to Nebraska. But opposition from U.S. landowners, Native American tribes, and environmentalists has delayed the project for the past 12 years and Biden had long pledged to scrap the permit. “While we welcome the President’s commitment to fight climate change, we are disappointed but acknowledge the President’s decision to fulfill his election campaign promise on Keystone XL,” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said in a statement. Alberta Premier Jason Kenney, who earlier this week threatened legal action if Keystone XL was scrapped, said on Wednesday he was “deeply disturbed” by the move. “This is a gut punch for the Canadian and Alberta economies. Sadly it is an insult directed at the United States’ most important ally and trading partner,” Kenney told a news conference. Christy Goldfuss, an energy and environment policy expert at the liberal Center for American Progress in Washington said a major part of the Biden administration’s climate strategy is to avoid building new long-lasting oil and gas projects such as KXL. “The more we invest in fossil fuel infrastructure, the harder it is to transition to the investments we need to make for clean energy,” said Goldfuss, who ran the Council on Environmental Quality in former President Barack Obama’s White House. TC Energy, in a statement issued before the revocation, expressed disappointment with a move it said would overturn a regulatory process that had lasted more than a decade. Former Republican President Donald Trump revived the project, but it still faced ongoing legal challenges. The Calgary-based company said it will suspend construction and warned there could be a “substantive” predominantly non-cash, after-tax charge to earnings in the first quarter of 2021. TC Energy said the decision would lead to layoffs for thousands of unionized construction workers. TC Energy stock closed down 1.2% at C$55.92 in Toronto while the benchmark Canadian share index edged up 0.3%. “This action is killing thousands of Canadian and American jobs at a time when both economies badly need private investment,” said Tim McMillan, chief executive of the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, adding it also wiped out equity investment in the pipeline by Canadian indigenous groups. The American Petroleum Institute called Biden’s move a “significant step backwards.” Canada, the world’s fourth-largest crude producer, ships most of that output to U.S. refineries. In 2019, the U.S. brought in 3.8 million bpd from Canada, more than half its daily imports of 6.8 million bpd. Canadian producers, who have struggled for years from low prices partly related to sometimes-congested pipelines, have long supported KXL. Producer Suncor Energy said it backed expanding market access to the United States through pipelines like KXL, which it argues would provide responsibly sourced oil to U.S. refineries for the benefit of U.S. consumers. But a Canada Energy Regulator report in November said western Canadian crude exports are expected to remain below total pipeline capacity over the next 30 years if KXL and two other projects proceed, prompting environmental groups to question the need for all three."

It is the second serious incident at a Suncor plant in three weeks. On Dec. 28 two workers were killed at the company’s Fort Hills mine after a bulldozer collided with a light vehicle truck. A spokeswoman for Calgary-based Suncor, one of Canada’s largest energy companies, said the bulldozer fell through the ice at around 3pm local time/2200 GMT on Wednesday afternoon. “Unfortunately, we can confirm that the dozer operator is unaccounted for,” Suncor spokeswoman Erin Rees said in an email. “Our thoughts are with the family, friends, and coworkers of this individual.” The operator, whose name has not been released, was an employee of Christina River Construction Ltd, Suncor said. Natasha McKenzie of Alberta Occupational Health and Safety confirmed the incident had been reported and an investigation is underway. Drilling operations were taking place in the area as the pond was being decommissioned in preparation for mining activity. Rees was unable to say whether it was unusual for bulldozers to be driving across the frozen pond. Tailing ponds are large manmade lakes filled with toxic byproducts of the oil sands extraction process such as wastewater, clay, heavy metals and residual oil. There is no impact on mining operations at the base plant, Suncor said. The plant consists of oil sands mining and upgrading operations and can produce around 350,000 barrels a day of heavy crude.

The company expects 2021 average production of 740,000 to 780,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, about 10% higher than the midpoint of the forecast range for 2020. It also set a capital program target of between C$3.8 billion ($2.92 billion) and C$4.5 billion, compared with C$3.6 billion to C$4 billion this year. Suncor said the budget is largely focused on sustaining capital, given the major planned maintenance programs in oil sands upgrading operations, Syncrude and downstream refineries. Last week, Suncor said it would become the operator of its Syncrude oil sands joint venture by the end of 2021. Syncrude is majority-owned by Suncor, which has 58.74% stake, with minority stakes held by Imperial Oil Ltd and others. North American oil and gas companies are restoring drilling of wells shut-in to counter a steep fall in prices earlier this year as the COVID-19 pandemic hammered fuel demand with U.S. crude prices dipping into the negative for the first time ever.

Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said more targeted measures could help avert another major national shutdown of the kind that hammered the economy earlier in the year. Released modeling updates show the cumulative death toll in the country could range between 10,285 and 10,400 by Nov 8. Cumulative cases could be between 251,800 and 262,200 by the same date. “(The) long-range forecast indicates that a stronger response is needed now to slow the spread of COVID-19,” chief public health officer Theresa Tam told a briefing. “If we decrease our current rate of contacts by 25% the epidemic is forecast to come under control in most locations,” she said. Canada has recorded 10,074 deaths and 228,542 cases so far and is breaking daily records for the number of new cases. Suncor Energy SU.TO, Canada’s second-biggest oil producer, confirmed 19 infections among workers at its Firebag oil sands site in Alberta, dating back to Oct. 18. All of those affected are in isolation at home or other locations, spokeswoman Erin Rees said. Suncor shut down part of the site where 17 of the employees worked, but the outbreak has not affected oil production, she said. Some provinces are reintroducing bans on indoor dining and limiting the size of gatherings. Manitoba, which has the highest rate of active cases per capita among provinces, said it would tighten restrictions starting on Monday. In Winnipeg, where most cases are located, all restaurants and bars will close to in-person dining. Trudeau said authorities know more now about the pandemic than they did six months ago. “There are things we can do to help to control the pandemic, the second wave, without - we hope - having to impose a nationwide shutdown,” he told the briefing."

The reductions will affect some 2,000 non-union jobs, said Scott Doherty, a spokesman for the Unifor union. The spread of the coronavirus has slowed economies worldwide, grounding flights and limiting road travel, resulting in weak oil prices. Canadian energy companies have also suffered from scarce capital due to chronic pipeline congestion and high emissions. The job cuts will range from 10% to 15% over the next year to 18 months, and include attrition, voluntary severance and early retirements across all of its locations, spokeswoman Sneh Seetal said. Some 5% of the reductions will take place in the next six months, she said. Dirk Tolman, chair of a Unifor local representing Suncor workers, said Suncor Chief Executive Mark Little addressed employees and said the company would need to cut expenses because demand and Suncor’s stock had fallen. “We can all see where the price of a barrel of oil is now,” Tolman said. “Every oil company in the country or the world is suffering. It gets people worried for sure.” Pipeline company TC Energy Corp TRP.TO this week said it was restructuring its Canadian gas operations.

-5.5660888998363935," Fire extinguished on Suncor offshore oil vessel that faces uncertain future WINNIPEG, Manitoba, May 30 (Reuters) - A fire on the idled Terra Nova oil facility that Suncor Energy operates off the coast of Newfoundland & Labrador has been extinguished, the energy regulator for the province said on Saturday, even as the vessel faced an uncertain future. No one was hurt in the fire, the Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board said in a statement. There was no oil or gas held onboard the vessel as it was not producing, the regulator said. Further details were not available and Suncor could not be immediately reached. The regulator ordered Suncor in December to shut down Terra Nova, operating in the Atlantic Ocean some 350 kilometres (217 miles) east of St. John’s, after finding that the company’s fire water pump system was non-compliant.

-45.62682871535053," Low oil prices for 'foreseeable future' led to Suncor writedown: CEO (Reuters) - The prospect of heavy oil prices remaining low for the foreseeable future prompted Suncor Energy SU.TO, Canada's second-largest crude producer, to take a C$2.8 billion ($2.11 billion) writedown on its newest oil sands site, its chief executive officer said on Thursday. The Fort Hills oil sands mine in northern Alberta began producing in 2018. Suncor announced the writedown on Wednesday, when it reported a larger-than-expected fourth-quarter loss due to impairment charges. “When the price went down in 2014, I don’t think people realized that we literally were going to go (down) year over year over year,” Chief Executive Mark Little said on a conference call Thursday. “We’re literally bouncing around, but trading sideways. When we look at the markets we think, ‘hey we’re sitting in this same range going forward for foreseeable future.’” The impairment was necessary as Suncor adjusted its global oil price forecast down about $10 per barrel, he said. West Texas Intermediate crude oil CLc1 traded around $51 per barrel Thursday, down 51% from its 2014 high and off about 16% this year. Suncor's less optimistic view of heavy oil comes as Vancouver-based Teck Resources Ltd TECKb.TO, one of Suncor's partners in Fort Hills, awaits Canadian government approval for its proposed Frontier oil sands mine. Teck Chief Executive Don Lindsay said last week that, regardless of the government decision, the company needs to see higher prices and other conditions to build the mine. Teck took a C$1.1-billion pre-tax writedown on Fort Hills in 2015. Frontier would be economic at a range of oil prices, Teck spokesman Chris Stannell said. “Frontier’s long life, consistent rate of production and low cash operating costs also make the cyclical nature of oil prices more manageable than developments with shorter lives and declining production rates,” he said.

-65.11953752243613," Canada regulator shuts down Suncor offshore oil site over failed pump (Reuters) - The oil regulator for the Atlantic Canadian province of Newfoundland and Labrador has ordered Suncor Energy's SU.TO offshore Terra Nova site to shut down, finding the company's fire water pump system was non-compliant. Terra Nova, operating in the Atlantic Ocean 350 kilometers (217 miles) east of St. John’s, failed to maintain and inspect critical safety equipment, carry out timely repairs and ensure it mitigated potential hazards, the Canada-Newfoundland and Labrador Offshore Petroleum Board (C-NLOPB) said in a statement on Thursday. The regulator said Suncor, which operates the vessel, specifically failed to meet requirements regarding its redundant fire water pump system on the floating installation. One of two water pumps failed on Nov. 7, and since then Suncor has used a seawater lift pump as a backup, said Suncor spokeswoman Jessica Depencier. The C-NLOPB has authorized this alternative in the past, but determined in this case that the seawater pump was an insufficient back-up, she said. Suncor shut down production on Thursday to comply with the order, she said. The suspension will continue until Suncor addresses the shortcomings, C-NLOPB said. Terra Nova can store 960,000 barrels of oil, according to Suncor, which owns nearly 38%. Other companies, including Husky Energy HSE.TO, own smaller stakes in the project. Seeing the regulator act before a potential disaster is encouraging, but it is unclear why it did not act sooner, said Gretchen Fitzgerald, national programs director for Sierra Club Canada Foundation, an environmental group. Unlike Canada’s national approach to major projects, which separates industry regulation from environmental impact assessment, offshore regulators combine the roles, Fitzgerald said. “We have had a lot of concerns over the years about how the regulator is a promoter of the industry and its expansion and is thereby in a conflict of interest,” Fitzgerald said. Any decision on separating those roles would be up to government, said Lesley Rideout, spokeswoman for the C-NLOPB. “We regulate in the public interest, remaining focused on regulatory oversight that reduces risk to safety and the environment to levels that are as low as reasonably practicable,” she said. Last year, a spill of 1,572 barrels of oil at Husky’s White Rose was the largest ever recorded off the coast of Newfoundland and Labrador. Suncor shares dipped 0.4% in Toronto."

Production is expected to be between 800,000 to 840,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d), a 5% increase over the midpoint of its 2019 forecast, the company said. Suncor and a number of other Canadian producers have asked the government to allow them to produce above their current curtailment limit as long as incremental production moves to market by rail. The mandatory cuts sharply reduced a price discount on Canadian versus U.S. oil, boosting revenue for many producers but affecting profits for integrated companies such as Suncor, which benefited from low-cost oil to run through its refineries. The company also said it expects capital spending between C$5.4 billion ($4.06 billion) and C$6.0 billion, adding that the capital increase in 2020 is predominantly associated with projects driving the C$2 billion of incremental free funds flow target by 2023. “Fort Hills and Syncrude remain adversely impacted due to the continued, disproportionate effect of curtailment as it is applied on a 2018 production basis when neither asset was operating at nameplate capacity,” the company added."

The natural gas-fueled cogeneration units will replace coke-fired boilers and provide steam generation for Suncor’s bitumen extraction and upgrading operations, as well as 800 megawatts of power to be transmitted to Alberta’s electricity grid. The Base Plant in northern Alberta is Suncor’s largest oil sands project, producing 357,000 barrels per day of synthetic crude from its two upgraders. “We’re trying to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions in every barrel we produce and this is a big step forward,” Suncor Chief Executive Mark Little told Reuters in a phone interview. Suncor already transmits about 450 megawatts to the Alberta grid from its existing cogeneration units and the Base Plant project will nearly triple that contribution, Little said. The project will provide low-carbon power equivalent to displacing 550,000 cars from the road, Suncor said in a statement. Suncor is aiming for a C$2 billion ($1.5 billion) increase in free funds flow by 2023 and Little said the cogeneration project would generate just over 10% of that through lowering oil sands operating costs and sustaining capital costs. It will also cut Base Plant sulphur dioxide emissions by 45% and nitrogen oxide emissions by 15%. Cogeneration uses natural gas to produce both industrial steam and electricity.

Suncor Energy Inc, Canada’s second-largest oil producer, and Shell Canada Ltd, a unit of Royal Dutch Shell PLC wrote to the National Energy Board (NEB) on Friday opposing Enbridge’s plans. They join MEG Energy Corp and the Explorers and Producers Association of Canada (EPAC) in growing dissent against Enbridge’s proposal to introduce long-term fixed-volume contracts on North America’s largest pipeline system. The 2.85-million-barrel-per-day Mainline carries the bulk of Canadian crude exports to the United States, and currently allocates capacity on a monthly basis. It is a crucial conduit for producers at a time when pipeline capacity is so constrained the Alberta government last week extended mandatory production curtailments. Enbridge launched a two-month open season to solicit bids from shippers for contracted space on 90% of the Mainline’s capacity. Enbridge has not publicly disclosed the terms on offer. Guy Jarvis, Enbridge’s executive vice president of liquids pipelines, said it was premature to ask the NEB to intervene before Oct. 2, when the open season ends. The company will then submit an application with finalized terms and tolls. “It seems it is getting the cart before the horse because the results of the open season will inform our application,” Jarvis told Reuters. Suncor and Shell asked the NEB, which will ultimately approve or reject Enbridge’s application, to review the terms on offer before Oct. 2. “Suncor continues to believe that the terms and conditions of the open season are not fair, just or reasonable,” the company said in a lawyers’ letter. The NEB is still reviewing the letters to determine its next steps, spokeswoman Sarah Kiley said. Canadian shippers fear U.S. refiners such as BP Plc and ExxonMobil Corp will snap up the bulk of Mainline capacity. They are also concerned the contracts will tie them into delivering crude to the Midwest region, limiting their ability to reach more liquid markets like the U.S. Gulf Coast. Shell said congestion on Canadian export pipelines meant Enbridge was effectively forcing shippers to sign up for unfair tolls on long-term committed capacity or risk being left without market access. “Shell is concerned that the open season and the offering may represent an abuse of market power,” Shell Canada president Michael Crothers said in the letter. Calgary-based investment bank GMP FirstEnergy said the NEB should extend the open season if it needs more to time to make a ruling. “We fear that if the open season is concluded in its current form, this will result in more pricing power being transferred to U.S. Midwest refiners and onerously burdensome long-term commitments on the books for Canadian producers,” GMP FirstEnergy analysts said in a note."

3.9220967324881832," Enbridge says open to Line 5 re-route after legal action by Wisconsin tribe (Reuters) - Canadian pipeline company Enbridge Inc said on Thursday it will consider re-routing its Line 5 oil pipeline after a Native American tribe in Wisconsin sued the company in a bid to get the pipeline moved off its reservation. The Bad River Band filed a federal lawsuit against Enbridge on Tuesday in the Western District of Wisconsin, asking for a section of Line 5 that runs across its reservation to be decommissioned and removed because of the risk of a leak. The 540,000 barrels-per-day pipeline ferries crude and propane from Alberta to refineries in the Midwest and Ontario. It is a critical part of Enbridge’s Mainline network, which delivers the bulk of Canadian oil exports to the United States. In the lawsuit the Bad River Band said pipeline easements, which are land use agreements between Enbridge and the tribe, for Line 5 had expired and as such the pipeline was trespassing. Enbridge said the vast majority of easements are valid until 2043 and those in question affect only a “small fraction” of the 12 miles of Line 5 within the reservation. “Enbridge has considered re-routing Line 5, and as discussed with the Bad River Band, remains open to this option as a solution,” Enbridge said in a statement. Line 5 also faces a court battle in Michigan, where the state filed a lawsuit last month asking for the decommissioning of an underwater section of the pipeline that runs beneath the Straits of Mackinac in the Great Lakes. One of Canada’s largest oil and gas producer Suncor Energy, which owns an 85,000 barrel per day refinery in Sarnia, Ontario, said it thought the probability of Line 5 getting shut in is “very low” but was nevertheless focused on the risk. “We are spending time looking through and trying to understand how we would manage that and we think there are ways we could mitigate the risk associated with it,” Suncor Chief Executive Officer Mark Little told investors on a second-quarter earnings call on Thursday."

-9.286155508698316," Suncor boosts synthetic crude output to offset Alberta government cuts CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Canada’s Suncor Energy produced record volumes of synthetic crude oil in the first quarter, the company said on Thursday, as it sought to maximize high-value production to offset the impact of Alberta government curtailments. The government of Alberta, Canada’s main crude-producing province and home to the oil sands, mandated temporary production cuts effective Jan. 1 to ease congestion on oil export pipelines and boost sagging crude prices. While a number of integrated producers, including Suncor, have criticized the government intervention in the market, company profits improved this quarter after a rebound in prices as a result of curtailments. Calgary-based Suncor reported operating earnings of C$1.2 billion ($891.73 million) on Wednesday. Mark Little, who took over as chief executive from Steve Williams on Thursday, said on an earnings call that first-quarter oil sands production was down 11 percent from the prior quarter as a result of the curtailments. Eighty percent of that first quarter production was light synthetic crude oil, as opposed to heavy crude, versus 65 percent in the final quarter of 2018, he added. “Given the unusual environment we took a number of key decisions to improve the overall financial results of the company,” Little said. “We maximized production of our highest value oil sands products, namely synthetic crude oil and diesel.” Suncor has upgraders that can process oil sands bitumen into refinery-ready synthetic crude, which trades at a higher price than lower-quality heavy crude. Little said Suncor also transferred production quotas between different oil sands projects to maximize value. The company is one of the largest oil sands operators, with a number of thermal projects and bitumen mining operations, including a majority stake in the Syncrude project. Little echoed recent comments by outgoing chief executive Williams in urging the Alberta government to end production curtailments and build new export pipelines. “For investment to return to the province we must find a path forward for Albertans to get full value for all production in the province,” he said."
-10.74956919309297," Suncor Energy first-quarter profit beats estimates on improved Canadian heavy crude pricing (Reuters) - Canada’s Suncor Energy Inc reported a profit on Wednesday that beat analysts’ estimates as the integrated oil producer reaped the benefits of improved Canadian heavy crude pricing due to Alberta’s production curtailments. The government’s mandated cuts that came into effect on January 1 have helped free up some pipeline space for the country’s crude, sharply reducing a price discount on Canadian versus U.S. oil. Canadian heavy crude prices surged to an average $42.53 a barrel in the first quarter, more than doubling from the previous quarter, and up 10 percent from the year-ago quarter. The future of these curtailments and other Alberta initiatives such as leasing trains to move crude and bypass full pipelines are uncertain following the election last month of the United Conservative Party. Suncor, Canada’s second largest oil and gas producer, said net earnings rose to C$1.209 billion ($899.62 million) or 93 Canadian cents per share in the three months ended March 31, from C$789 million or 48 Canadian cents, a year earlier. The company said the overall impact of crude oil and refined product inventory valuation had a net positive impact on its operating earnings of C$288 million in the quarter. Excluding one-off items, the company earned 77 Canadian cents per share, beating analysts’ average estimates of 53 Canadian cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv."

-9.655386931387678," Suncor CEO urges Alberta to find way out of oil curtailments CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - The outgoing chief executive of Canada’s Suncor Energy on Thursday urged the new Alberta government to find a way out of mandatory oil production curtailments that were imposed this year to help boost crude prices. The CEO, Steve Williams, also put Canada’s failure to build new export pipelines that would ship more crude out of landlocked Alberta squarely at the feet of federal and provincial governments and regulators. Williams will retire next week after 17 years with Canada’s largest energy company by market capitalization, having spent seven of those years at the helm. His departure coincides with Jason Kenney’s United Conservative Party’s taking power in Alberta, with a promise to aggressively champion the province’s beleaguered energy industry. Canada is home to the world’s third-largest crude reserves, the bulk of which are in Alberta’s oil sands, but has struggled for years to get new export pipelines built because of regulatory delays and fierce environmental opposition. Last year Canadian oil prices hit a record discount as pipeline congestion led to a glut of crude building up in Alberta storage tanks, prompting the previous provincial government to impose temporary production cuts effective Jan. 1. Suncor is an integrated producer whose refineries benefited from being able to buy cheap crude. “My advice to government is find a managed way to exit this curtailment so the market can start to work again,” Williams said in an interview at Suncor’s headquarters in downtown Calgary. In the short-term curtailments have boosted prices, but in the medium- and long-term the intervention has made crude-by-rail shipments uneconomic and is deterring investment in the province, he said. Williams, who will join the board of pipeline company TransCanada Corp after leaving Suncor, said the job of provincial and federal government is to not do anything that could jeopardize much-needed new pipelines’ being built. “I put the failure of getting pipelines and therefore inward investment firmly in the lap of regulators and government,” Williams said. “Today we have project queued up with investors willing to fund them but frightened by the quagmire they find in Canada.” He also said it was possible the new Alberta government’s plan to scrap carbon pricing, at a time when investors are putting greater emphasis on the environment, may deter international investment in the oil sands. During his time in charge, Williams presided over the decision to scrap the C$12 billion Voyageur upgrader project, the sanctioning of the C$17 billion Fort Hills mine and a devastating wildfire in the oil sands hub of Fort McMurray in 2016."
-6.404315205360471," Canadian crude exports by rail uneconomic amid output cuts: Suncor executive HOUSTON (Reuters) - Canada’s mandated oil production cuts are preventing Suncor Energy Inc, one of Canada’s biggest oil producers, from sending its heavy crude to the U.S. Gulf Coast by rail, a company official said in an interview on Tuesday. The Canadian oil producer is “interested in rail economics going forward,” but the rise in Canadian heavy crude prices since the December mandated production cuts have made rail shipments “difficult to justify,” said Steve Reynish, a Suncor executive vice president, at the CERAWeek conference. Gulf Coast oil refiners have scrambled for heavy crude supplies after U.S. sanctions on Venezuela’s state-run PDVSA halted its exports of the grade to the United States. Suncor sees the supply gap as “a great opportunity,” but Canada already ships “everything we possibly can, given the pipeline and rail constraints,” Reynish said. The Alberta government should phase out the mandated output curtailment to “let the market react to signals we’re getting,” he said."

-4.8921866380229035," Buffett's Suncor bet to revive investor interest in Canadian energy TORONTO (Reuters) - Berkshire Hathaway Inc’s re-investment in Suncor Energy Inc highlights the benefits of being an integrated oil company and could revive investor interest in the languishing Canadian energy sector, fund managers said. The move is also seen by some as a wager the energy sector could benefit from a change in the guard in Canada’s oil-rich Alberta province, which has an election this year. Berkshire’s new 0.7 percent stake in Suncor, valued at C$488 million ($370.54 million) at current prices, is already worth 23 percent more since Berkshire bought it in the last quarter. It comes more than two years after it sold for $618 million a 1.4 percent stake it had bought in 2013 and added to in 2015. Its re-entry is seen by analysts as a validation that Canada’s biggest oil and gas company has catalysts - such as a new incoming CEO and the eventual removal of Alberta oil curtailments - that could propel the stock higher. Berkshire has not publicly discussed its reasons for its recent investment in Suncor, and did not comment when reached by Reuters. While a bet on Suncor is not seen as a play on the entire industry, major Berkshire shareholder Warren Buffett’s stature as a value investor is expected to prompt other funds to wade back into the Canadian energy sector. “People always pay attention when Warren Buffett makes a play, and I don’t think it will be any different this time around,” said Mike Archibald, associate portfolio manager at AGF Investments Inc. “It’s a great signal that foreign capital is starting to flow back to Canada as this will ultimately be the main driver of stock prices.” Investors and some foreign majors have shunned Canada’s oil patch in recent years due to high production costs, environmental concerns, and difficulties moving crude due to clogged pipelines. Berkshire has largely avoided big-cap energy stocks with the exception of an investment in Exxon Mobil Corp, which it owned for more than a year before selling the more than $3 billion stake in late 2014 as oil prices fell. Suncor, however, is positioned to weather more adverse market conditions than many producers because it owns refineries and has committed pipeline space, allowing it to access U.S. markets. “Berkshire is typically a countercyclical value investor, so we are not surprised the interest was renewed in a name like Suncor,” said Cavan Yie, portfolio manager at Manulife Asset Management, which manages about $364 billion in assets. Suncor is one of his largest positions. “Suncor is somewhat insulated from these risks given the fact that they have a strong downstream operation, which financially benefits from oil bottlenecks and that is unique to Suncor, which you can’t get with many other companies in the energy space.” Suncor shares are up 23 percent year-to-date giving it a $54.6 billion market value, compared with 11 percent for the Toronto Stock Exchange 300 Composite Index. Buffett has found an “attractive entry point for an out-of-favor sector” and a “good high-quality company that is industry leading”, said Brian Pow, vice president of research and equity analyst at Acumen Capital Finance Partners. In another Canadian investment, Buffett bought into Home Capital in 2017 when the Canadian alternative mortgage lender was under pressure and made a big profit by largely exiting the position late last year. Some investors are betting that a change in government in Alberta after a spring election could benefit the oil industry. The governing New Democrats have taken big steps to help the industry, including leasing rail cars this week to move oil, but badly needed pipelines remain stalled due to opposition from environmentalists. “While a new governing party may not change the actual end outcomes of the pipeline discussion, it may provide some optimism that a new set of solutions will be pursued,” AGF’s Archibald said."

Suncor, Canada’s biggest oil and gas company, is considered one of the safest Canadian energy companies to invest in, given its integrated structure and diversified business mix. Berkshire’s investment puts the Buffett stamp on Suncor and could be seen as a positive for the Canadian energy sector. The move comes at a time when global investors have been pulling away from Canada because of its carbon-intensive oil sands and struggle to approve pipelines. Berkshire said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it has a stake of 10.8 million shares in the company, representing about 0.7 percent of Suncor’s total outstanding shares, according to Eikon data from Refinitiv. Ahead of Thursday’s news, Suncor’s shares had shed 17.3 percent in the last six months, due in part to Alberta’s decision to force mandatory production cuts last year.

Alberta has mandated temporary output cuts of 325,000 barrels per day (bpd) until excess crude in storage is drawn down. The Western Canadian province’s production cut, which will come into effect on Jan. 1, comes amid depressed prices for Canada’s heavy crude owing to pipeline bottlenecks. The mandated cuts are controversial because heavily integrated producers such as Suncor and Husky Energy Inc benefit from the low crude prices to feed their refineries.

-2.9413950258092654," Suncor Energy not trimming oil output as rivals pull back CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Suncor Energy Inc, Canada’s second-largest energy producer, does not need to reduce crude output as some of its peers are doing to cope with low prices, Chief Executive Steve Williams said on Thursday. Suncor, which has dedicated pipeline space for its crude as well as refineries in Canada, is mostly insulated from the impact of growing price discounts that U.S. refineries apply to Canadian oil, which have hurt rival producers, Williams said. Those discounts are largely attributed to pipeline constraints. “The higher-cost producers are having to pull back because they’re not making any margin on their last barrel. We’re not in that circumstance,” Williams said on a call with analysts in response to a question on whether Suncor would cut production. “If we were, we wouldn’t hesitate to pull throughput back.” Rival Cenovus Energy Inc said on Wednesday it was limiting output due to severe discounts. Discounts should abate this year, with more significant relief arriving when Enbridge Inc’s expanded Line 3 pipeline comes online late next year, Williams said. Canadian heavy crude for December delivery in Hardisty, Alberta, was at $46.50 a barrel below North American crude futures on Thursday, according to Shorcan Energy brokers. That meant Canadian crude was trading at less than half the benchmark price. Late on Wednesday, Suncor reported improved third-quarter profit on higher oil prices and increased refinery margins, along with increased sales and output. Some analysts have suggested Suncor could be interested in buying heavy-crude producer MEG Energy Inc, which has received a hostile bid from Husky Energy Inc. But Williams said Suncor was not currently considering any specific acquisition. “Particularly in the Canadian sector, there’s nothing specific we’re looking at because we don’t see that value-added” opportunity, he said, adding that Suncor will likely boost its dividend in early 2019. Williams said Suncor, majority owner of the problem-plagued Syncrude oil sands site, had agreed with its partners on terms to connect Syncrude by pipeline with Suncor’s base plant, in an effort to improve reliability. Syncrude, in which Imperial Oil Ltd, Sinopec and a subsidiary of CNOOC Ltd own smaller stakes, was forced to shut down in June due to a power outage but is now back online.

A court overturned last week the Canadian government’s approval of the Trans Mountain pipeline expansion. That decision added to “troubling” pipeline delays, Williams said at a Barclay’s investor conference in New York. “There is clearly a question of confidence in Canada,” Williams said. Suncor is currently ramping up production of its new Fort Hills mine in the Alberta oil sands and is due to decide in late 2019 and early 2020 whether to expand production at existing facilities, Williams said. “You will not see us approve those projects until we have more clarity on pipelines,” he said. “I would want to see actual, physical progress on the ground before I would commit.” Canadian heavy oil production in Western Canada is expanding but construction of new pipelines has not kept pace, stranding supplies in the landlocked province and deepening a price discount to North American futures. Oil producers have eagerly awaited the expansion of Trans Mountain, owned by the Canadian government, which would move Alberta crude to a British Columbia port. TransCanada Corp's proposed Keystone XL pipeline may be delayed by a U.S. State Department environmental review, while Enbridge Inc's ENB.TO Line 3 replacement has cleared key regulatory hurdles. Suncor has sufficient committed pipeline space for its production, including Fort Hills, Williams said, and its own refineries shield it from exposure to the price discount on Canadian heavy oil."
-18.57727549757254," Cenovus to hold back oil output on pipeline woes, Suncor weighs hit (Reuters) - Canada’s Cenovus Energy said on Thursday it would hold back on future oil production until pipeline bottlenecks have eased, while some of the country’s top oil and gas producers ramped up output in the recent quarter in response to higher demand. As demand for heavy Canadian crude from U.S. Gulf of Mexico refiners has risen amid a drop in Venezuelan production, the country’s energy infrastructure has failed to keep pace. The surge in production - expected to reach more than half a million barrels per day in 2019 - has led to pipeline constraints, resulting in Canadian heavy crude trading at steep discounts to U.S. light crude as well as producers turning to crude-by-rail options. “Transportation bottlenecks are by far the biggest challenge for Canadian producers, mainly because the pipeline constraints won’t be alleviated until the end of 2019, at the earliest,” said Edward Jones analyst Jennifer Rowland. “It impacts their decisions for future production projects, and it impacts investor sentiment toward the companies,” she added. Shares in Calgary, Alberta-based Cenovus fell as much as 2 percent, but recovered to edge up slightly in afternoon trading. Cenovus’ second-quarter production soared 61 percent to 518,530 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d), while rival Suncor Energy’s output rose 22.7 percent to 661,700 boe/d. “We do not want to expand our oil sands production until we are confident about transportation capacity,” Cenovus Chief Executive Alex Pourbaix told analysts. Cenovus said it is beginning to see increased activity across its rail-loading facilities as pipelines operate at full capacity. Calgary-based rival Husky Energy, however, reported a 7.5 percent drop in total production as it increased focus on its refining business to take advantage of widening heavy crude price differentials. “The physical integration of our upstream and downstream businesses, including our committed pipeline capacity, shielded us from location and quality differentials,” Husky Chief Executive Officer Rob Peabody said. Husky posted a second-quarter profit of C$448 million compared to a loss of C$93 million a year ago.

-5.38965918221346," Suncor's Syncrude to resume some output in July, full operations in September (Reuters) - Suncor Energy Inc said on Monday its Syncrude oil sands project in Western Canada will resume some production in July, sooner than expected, and hit full capacity in September, following an outage last month that disrupted total output. The disruption at Syncrude, representing 10 percent of Canadian oil production, has tightened Canadian supplies and reduced the crude flow to Cushing, Oklahoma, the delivery point of the U.S. crude futures contract. Suncor, the biggest stakeholder in the northern Alberta project, said an early investigation showed the cause of disruption was a transformer trip. Syncrude can produce up to 360,000 barrels per day of crude oil and had been expected to remain down through July. But Suncor said one of its coker drums, which produces about 150,000 bpd, would return to service during the second half of July. A second one, which has an output of about 100,000 bpd, is expected to return to service in the first half of August. Coker units convert mined bitumen from the oil sands into synthetic crude oil. Suncor expects pipeline shipments from its Syncrude oil sands project to be about 60 percent to 70 percent of total capacity in August. Western Canada Select (WCS) heavy crude trades at a discount to West Texas Intermediate light oil (WTI), the North American benchmark, in part because of difficulties transporting crude through clogged pipelines from Alberta to U.S. refineries. Traders reduced that discount for three consecutive days last week as Haywood Securities research predicted a longer start-up schedule that would ease pipeline congestion. The discount was little changed in early trading on Monday, according to Shorcan Energy brokers. WTI crude futures eased 0.7 percent to $73.29 per barrel.The outage will cost Syncrude about 205,300 bpd in lost production in the third quarter, which translates to about 59 percent utilization, AltaCorp analysts wrote in a note. “We view the update as slightly negative as the project is expected to return to normal operations ... after the acceleration of planned maintenance, resulting in a longer outage than originally anticipated,” they added. Suncor is expected to report the ongoing quarter’s results on July 25. The company’s Toronto shares dipped 0.4 percent at C$53.74 in morning trade on Monday. Imperial Oil Ltd, which is majority owned by Exxon Mobil Corp , and China’s Sinopec have also invested in the project."

The facility, which can produce up to 360,000 barrels per day of crude oil, was hit by a power outage last month and was expected to remain down through July. There was no update on the timing of restarting production, said Suncor spokeswoman Sneh Seetal. The idled Syncrude site is one of several supply disruptions that boosted global oil prices last week. Brent oil rose on Wednesday, driven higher by a threat from an Iranian commander and a drop in U.S. crude inventories for the second week in a row.

9.241559389253917," Suncor CEO expects Canada to move soon to ensure oil pipeline is built CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - The chief executive of Canada's Suncor Energy Inc SU.TO said on Wednesday he expected Prime Minister Justin Trudeau to move in the ""next few weeks"" to ensure that Kinder Morgan Canada's KML.TO Trans Mountain oil pipeline expansion goes ahead. Steve Williams would not say what exactly he expected Trudeau to do to guarantee the C$7.4 billion ($5.8 billion) project gets built, but told reporters he was encouraged by a long conversation he had with the prime minister last month. “I’m encouraged by the comments they’ve made, but the proviso I put on it is that we’ve got to see these plans roll out that they’ve been working on and I think we see that over the next few weeks,” Williams said. Kinder Morgan paused work last month on the Trans Mountain expansion, citing opposition in British Columbia, and said the company would decide by May 31 whether to go ahead with the project, which would nearly triple capacity on an existing line from Alberta to British Columbia’s coast. Both Alberta and the federal government have pledged support to the project, including financial backing. Trudeau’s Liberal government has also said it will assert its jurisdiction, even as British Columbia has gone to court to attempt to prove its right to block increased crude shipments west. Williams said earlier on Wednesday that Suncor’s current growth plan was not constrained by pipeline bottlenecks but that the Calgary-based company did not expect to make any further major investments in the oil sands until market access improves. “We have existing pipeline access to accommodate all of our oil sands production,” he said. Canadian energy producers are struggling as increased oil sands output has run up against a lack of new export pipelines and tight rail capacity, sending the differential between Canadian oil prices and the U.S. crude benchmark CLc1 to multi-year highs. Suncor said that while the discount that Canadian producers face nearly doubled in the first quarter compared with last year’s quarter, it had no impact on the company’s earnings or cash flow, as low crude prices were offset by better midstream and downstream returns. Williams said he was confident that both the Trans Mountain expansion and Enbridge Inc's ENB.TO Line 3 replacement, along with others moving crude south, would move ahead. “I don’t think in the last five years I’ve had a higher degree of confidence that these lines are going to be built,” he said. “So I’m greatly encouraged.” Suncor shares were up 0.66 percent at C$49.19 on Wednesday afternoon.

9.241559389253917," Canada's Suncor says growth plan not constrained by pipeline access CALGARY, Alberta, May 2 (Reuters) - Suncor Energy Inc said on Wednesday that its current growth plan is not constrained by pipeline bottlenecks and it does not expect to make any further major investments in Canada’s oil sands until market access improves. The Calgary-based company, Canada’s second-largest energy producer, will continue to look at assets available in the market, but is “not chasing anything,” Chief Executive Steve Williams said on an investor call. “The real strength of our growth plan for the next five or six years is our high level of certainty, and it’s not constrained by market access issues,” he said. “We have existing pipeline access to accommodate all of our oil sands production.” Canadian energy producers are struggling as increased oil sands output has run up against a lack of new export pipelines and tight rail capacity, sending the differential between Canadian oil prices and the U.S. crude benchmark to multi-year highs. Suncor said that while the discount Canadian producers face nearly doubled in the first quarter compared with last year’s quarter, it had no impact on the company’s earnings or cash flow, as low crude prices were offset by better midstream and downstream returns. New pipeline capacity is desperately needed to help Canadian producers fetch better prices for their product, but there are challenges. Kinder Morgan Canada has stopped non-essential work on its Trans Mountain expansion in face of opposition from the province of British Columbia, while Enbridge Inc’s Line 3 replacement is facing new hurdles in Minnesota. Williams said he had spoken with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on the importance of getting those pipeline built and was confident that two projects, along with others moving crude south, will move ahead. “I don’t think in the last five years I’ve had a higher degree of confidence that these lines are going to be built,” he said. “So I’m greatly encouraged.” Suncor shares were up 0.5 percent at C$49.10 on Wednesday morning.

9.241559389253917," Suncor profit beats, oil production falls CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - Suncor Energy Inc SU.TO, Canada's second-largest energy producer, posted a first-quarter profit that beat analyst expectations, as improved crude oil pricing and higher refining margins outweighed lower production. The Calgary-based company also said it would focus spending in 2018 on ramping up its two major growth projects; the Fort Hills oil sands project in Alberta and the Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N-led Hebron project off the province of Newfoundland and Labrador. Suncor said the ramp up at Fort Hills, its largest project, was ahead of schedule, with two extraction units operating, and a third expected to come online in the second half of 2018. The company’s operating profit, which excludes one-time items, jumped 21.3 percent to C$985 million ($766.4 million), or 60 Canadian cents per share, in the first quarter. Analysts had predicted earnings of 52 Canadian cents per share, according to Reuters data. That boost was driven by better pricing and margins, though partially offset by higher operating costs on planned and unplanned maintenance, the company said. Suncor’s total upstream production fell 4.9 percent to 689,400 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d), compared with 725,100 boe/d in the prior year quarter. Oil sands production was 404,800 barrels per day (bpd) in the first quarter of 2018, compared with 448,500 bpd, with cash operating costs per barrel jumping 19 percent to $26.85, from $22.55 in the year-ago quarter. Net earnings fell to C$789 million, or 48 Canadian cents per share, in the three months ended March 31, as a foreign exchange loss weighed. That compared with C$1.35 billion, or 81 Canadian cents per share a year earlier, when profit was boosted by an asset sale and a foreign exchange gain."
