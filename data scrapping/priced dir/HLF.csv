-9.260371001410522," Carl Icahn sells over half his Herbalife stake for $600 million (Reuters) - Activist investor Carl Icahn has sold more than half his stake in Herbalife Nutrition back to the company for $600 million at $48.05 a share and has given up the five seats on the firm’s board held by his representatives, Herbalife said in a statement. Icahn had a 15.5% stake in Herbalife as of Sept. 30. The latest deal is expected to close by Jan. 7, after which Icahn Enterprises will hold about 8 million of Herbalife’s shares, representing a stake of about 6%, the statement added. The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that in recent days Icahn had sold about 10% of his stake back to the multi-level marketing company, whose products include dietary supplements. Icahn's remaining stake is worth about $400 million, according to WSJ on.wsj.com/3b4a4UR. Icahn began buying Herbalife shares in 2013 while extolling the company and had since been its largest shareholder. In 2013, Herbalife and Icahn Enterprises entered into a support agreement that allowed Icahn Enterprises to have five board seats for as long as it held at least 14 million Herbalife shares. With Icahn’s stake now falling below the threshold of 14 million shares, the support agreement has been terminated and the activist investor’s board representatives have stepped down, Herbalife said on Sunday.. Icahn said that the time for activism at Herbalife “has passed”. “At the time (when he started investing in Herbalife), I believed the company was in need of an activist and that certainly turned out to be correct”, Icahn said on Sunday. “The time for activism has passed as the company has grown, and I don’t typically invest billions of dollars in companies where our role as activist is not needed,” he added."

-0.6260117124394179," U.S. says Herbalife to pay $123.1 million to resolve China bribery case NEW YORK (Reuters) - Herbalife Nutrition Ltd will pay $123.1 million to settle criminal and civil charges it bribed Chinese officials in government agencies and media outlets to boost its business in China, the U.S. Department of Justice said on Friday. The multi-level marketing company, whose products include dietary supplements, entered a three-year deferred prosecution agreement in which it admitted to conspiring to violate the books and records provision of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, an anti-bribery law. Authorities said Herbalife schemed from 2007 to 2016 to bribe Chinese officials with cash, entertainment, meals and travel to obtain direct selling licenses, reduce government scrutiny and suppress negative coverage by state-controlled media. China accounted for 19% of Herbalife’s $4.49 billion of net sales in 2016, up from 7% in 2006, regulatory filings show. Herbalife approved “extensive and systematic corrupt payments” to Chinese officials, while falsifying records to make its bribes appear as legitimate business expenses, Acting U.S. Attorney Audrey Strauss in Manhattan said in a statement. The company will pay a $55.74 million criminal fine, plus $67.31 million in disgorgement and interest to resolve a related U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission civil case. Herbalife, which has offices in Los Angeles, said it previously set aside funds for the settlement, which also requires that it upgrade compliance procedures. Last November, U.S. prosecutors filed related corruption charges against Yanliang Li, who led Herbalife’s Chinese unit, and Hongwei Yang, who led its external affairs department. Both are Chinese citizens and remain at large. Six weeks earlier, Herbalife agreed to pay $20 million to settle SEC charges it misled investors about its Chinese business. Carl Icahn, the activist investor, owns 15.5% of Herbalife. Hedge fund manager William Ackman bet $1 billion against Herbalife starting in 2012, saying it violated Chinese direct-selling laws and was a pyramid scheme. He unwound his position as Herbalife’s stock price kept rising. Herbalife shares fell 1.2% to $49.10 early Friday afternoon."

The U.S. Department of Justice and Securities and Exchange Commission have been investigating the involvement of the multilevel marketing company’s Chinese unit in an alleged decade-long scheme to bribe Chinese government officials to win business and evade regulatory scrutiny. The bribes were intended to help Los Angeles-based Herbalife obtain direct selling licenses, reduce government scrutiny of its Chinese operations, and suppress negative coverage by state-controlled media, authorities have said. Under the tentative settlement, Herbalife said it would enter a deferred prosecution agreement with the Department of Justice, which would defer criminal prosecution of the company on charges related to a conspiracy to violate the books and records provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act for three years.

-8.928161579068167," U.S. charges two former Herbalife executives in China over bribery scheme: source NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors criminally charged two former executives of Herbalife Nutrition Ltd's HLF.N Chinese unit with running a decade-long scheme to bribe Chinese government officials to win business and evade regulatory scrutiny, a person familiar with the matter said. Herbalife was not criminally charged, and the multi-level marketing company was not identified by name in Thursday’s indictment against Yanliang Li, also known as Jerry Li, and Hongwei Yang, also known as Mary Yang. The person familiar said Herbalife was their employer. Li, the former head of Herbalife’s Chinese unit, and Yang, who led its external affairs department and reported to Li, were charged by the U.S. Department of Justice with conspiring to violate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by orchestrating the bribes and circumventing Herbalife’s accounting controls. Prosecutors also charged Li with perjury for lying under oath when the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission questioned him about the alleged bribes, and for destroying evidence. Both defendants are 51-year-old Chinese citizens and remain at large. The SEC filed related civil charges against Li. Lawyers for the defendants could not immediately be identified. Herbalife did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The charges were announced six weeks after Herbalife agreed to pay $20 million to settle SEC civil charges that it misled investors from 2012 to 2018 about how its Chinese business operated, without admitting wrongdoing. U.S. Attorney Geoffrey Berman in Manhattan said Li and Yang approved “extensive and systematic payments of bribes” to Chinese government officials from roughly 2007 to 2017. Authorities said the bribes included cash, entertainment, meals and travel, and Yang’s department reimbursed employees more than $25 million for entertaining and gift-giving. The bribes were intended to help Los Angeles-based Herbalife obtain direct selling licenses, reduce government scrutiny of its Chinese operations, and suppress negative coverage by state-controlled media, authorities said. By 2016, China accounted for 19%, or $869 million, of Herbalife’s $4.49 billion of net sales, up from 7% in 2006, regulatory filings show. The $20 million SEC accord resolved charges that Herbalife told investors it paid distributors in China differently from distributors elsewhere, because the multi-level marketing it normally uses is illegal in that country, when in fact the compensation methods were similar. William Ackman, the hedge fund manager, made a $1 billion bet against Herbalife starting in 2012, and accused the company of being a pyramid scheme, which it denied. He later unwound his position as Herbalife’s stock price kept rising. Herbalife shares were down 30 cents, or 0.7%, at $43.50. The criminal case is U.S. v. Li et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 19-cr-00760. The SEC case is SEC v. Li in the same court, No. 19-10562."

24.908619449311225," Herbalife Nutrition to pay $20 million to settle false disclosure charges: U.S. SEC WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said on Friday that Herbalife Nutrition Ltd. has agreed to pay $20 million to settle charges that it made false and misleading statements about its business operations in China. The weight-management and nutrition company did not admit or deny the agency charges, but agreed to cease and desist from further antifraud violations, according to the SEC. Herbalife did not immediately reply to requests for comment. Herbalife employs ‘multi-level marketing’, whereby direct sales companies encourage their workforce to recruit new sellers by awarding them a percentage of the sales. The SEC found that between 2012 and 2018 Herbalife falsely disclosed to investors that, since direct selling was permitted in China but multi-level marketing was prohibited, it had adopted a different compensation model for business in that country. In reality, its business operations and how it paid service providers in China were similar to its worldwide operations, the SEC said. While Herbalife claimed it paid Chinese providers on an hourly basis, the SEC said those workers did not record their own hours or detail their work, and instead relied on pre-printed forms that assigned a certain number of hours to specific services. The markets regulator is seeking to stamp out what it regards as inaccurate disclosures from U.S. companies on their global operations. “Herbalife deprived investors of valuable information necessary to evaluate risk and make informed investment decisions,” said Marc Berger, Director of the SEC’s New York Regional Office. “When making disclosures to investors, issuers must ensure that those disclosures are accurate.”"
18.193018106919546," Icahn sells some of his Herbalife shares, remains biggest investor BOSTON (Reuters) - Billionaire investor Carl Icahn, who spent years defending Herbalife Nutrition Ltd HLF.N against prominent short-seller William Ackman, said on Friday that he has sold some of his shares in the nutrition and weight loss company because the position had become too big for him. Herbalife last year announced plans to buy back $600 million of its own stock as talk mounted that management had considered selling the company to a private equity investor. For months, speculation grew over whether Icahn, who owned 47 million shares and was Herbalife’s largest investor, would sell some or even all of his stake. “Given that our Herbalife investment has become an outsized position, representing approximately 24 percent exposure to total NAV (net asset value), it is only prudent for IEP to reduce its exposure,” Icahn said in a statement. He will have sold 11.4 million shares. Icahn remains Herbalife’s largest shareholder, has five directors on the board, and said on Friday that its future is bright. “We believe Herbalife’s business is stable, the short-sellers have largely exited, and the Company is well-positioned for the future,” he said in the statement. On Friday Icahn said he tendered all shares, but only 11.4 million shares would be purchased at $52.50 each. Without Icahn’s shares, the tender would have been undersubscribed, suggesting investors felt the price was too low and they could do better by selling in the market. Herbalife’s shares tumbled 7.6 percent to $49.72 in early trading. Since the start of the year it has climbed 59 percent. In late February, Icahn’s rival activist investor William Ackman said he had exited his $1 billion short bet against the company. Ackman had spent six years claiming that Herbalife was operating an illegal pyramid scheme in which it made more money from recruiting new members instead of from selling the product. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission probed the matter, and reached a settlement with Herbalife in 2016. It involved a $200 million penalty and requirements that the company reform some of its business practices. Talk that Herbalife might go private had helped galvanize Ackman’s exit. In February the company announced a 2 for 1 stock split, plans to refinance some of its outstanding convertible notes due next year and changed its corporate name from Herbalife to Herbalife Nutrition."

1.6862764705882292," Herbalife prepared secret report to get into Ackman's thinking: book NEW YORK (Reuters) - Herbalife Ltd. HLF.N commissioned a secret report to understand what made activist investor William Ackman tick as he accused the company of being a fraud and bet its share price would collapse to zero, a new book shows. Nearly two years after Ackman first began researching his $1 billion short-bet against Herbalife, the nutrition company paid $100,000 in 2014 for a 30-page dossier to help management understand and then react to its adversary, television journalist Scott Wapner wrote. Ackman alleged in public presentations that the company was running an illegal pyramid scheme where members were paid more to recruit new people than for selling the actual product and said many times that the stock price would tumble to zero once the government investigated. Herbalife denied the allegations and its share price traded at $102.37 on Tuesday. Wapner’s book “When the Wolves Bite; Two Billionaires, One Company, and an Epic Wall Street Battle” is being published on Tuesday. The existence of the dossier had not been previously reported. Herbalife did not respond to a request for comment and a spokesman for Ackman declined to comment. Ackman is described in the dossier as being “fiercely competitive,” “extremely smart,” and “aggressive and competitive in all things,” Wapner writes, quoting the report. Ackman “believes he is in the right and stubbornly, inflexibly, sticks to his positions,” Wapner adds, quoting the report. The battle over Herbalife’s future pitted Ackman, who runs $8.2 billion Pershing Square Capital Management, against Wall Street rivals including Carl Icahn, who bought a big stake in the company in 2013, making it one of Wall Street’s most expensive and enduring fights. Forensic psychiatrist Park Dietz relied on media reports and television clips to compile the dossier and did not interview his subject directly, Wapner wrote. Ackman exited the Herbalife short bet this year, ending his six-year long mission. While Ackman lost money on the bet, the Federal Trade Commission investigated Herbalife and settled with the company in July 2016. Herbalife paid $200 million to compensate consumers who had been deceived into believing they could earn “substantial money” by selling Herbalife products, and the company was forced by the FTC to restructure its business."
