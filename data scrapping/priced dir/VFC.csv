13.302804366461855," Vans sneaker maker's revenue, profit view disappoints on pandemic hit (Reuters) - VF Corp raised its full-year forecast for revenue and profit on Wednesday, but it came in below market estimates as the apparel maker struggles to bring in sales with the COVID-19 pandemic shuttering stores in some of its major markets. The Vans sneaker maker’s shares fell 8% in premarket trading as it posted a 5.8% drop in net revenue for the third quarter and said more than 60% of its stores were temporarily closed in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, with less than 10% of its outlets shut in North America. Its digital revenue jumped 53% but that was not enough to counterbalance weak in-store sales, as fresh restrictions in its key U.S. and Europe markets doused a short-lived sales rebound triggered by the lifting of earlier curbs. VF now expects fiscal 2021 revenue between $9.1 billion and $9.2 billion, with the midpoint below the Refinitiv IBES estimate of $9.19 billion, even as it pointed to an about $125 million revenue boost from its recent acquisition of Supreme. The owner of Timberland and The North Face brands also expects fiscal 2021 adjusted earnings per share of about $1.30, 6 cents below Wall Street expectations. The company had previously forecast 2021 revenue of at least $9 billion and per-share profit of at least $1.20. Denver, Colorado-based VF’s net revenue fell to $2.97 billion, missing the average analyst estimate of $3 billion, as even the traditionally busy holiday shopping season saw thin crowds. However, excluding items, VF earned 93 cents per share, above the 90-cent estimate."

4.961592074761515," Vans owner VF Corp to buy streetwear brand Supreme for about $2.1 billion (Reuters) - VF Corp VFC.N said on Monday it would pay $2.1 billion to buy streetwear apparel company Supreme, adding another popular brand to the Vans shoe maker's roster. VF Corp, which also houses brands such as The North Face and Timberland, said it would make an additional payment of up to $300 million, subject to satisfaction of certain post-deal closing milestones. Shares of VF Corp surged about 13% to $78.94 in afternoon trading. It said current investors Carlyle Group and New York-based private equity firm Goode Partners were selling their stakes in Supreme, founded by American-British businessman James Jebbia in 1994. Known for its red box logo with “Supreme” written in white, the brand has gained a following among “hypebeasts,” or fans of the streetwear style, with product launches of everything from hoodies to burner phones selling out in minutes and people lining up outside its 12 stores worldwide for hours. Perceived scarcity has helped Supreme to acquire a cachet among young people and allowed it to charge far higher prices than other streetwear brands like VF’s Vans and Nike. “This scarcity, novelty and strong social influence model supports meaningful pricing power resulting best in class profitability,” VF Corp Chief Executive Steve Rendle said. VF Corp estimated the broader streetwear market to be a roughly $50 billion global opportunity and that Supreme was at the epicenter of this market, he said. VF Corp executive said its deal with Supreme will help bolster its e-commerce business, which has become more urgent for apparel and footwear makers due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Supreme, which has collaborated with many prominent fashion names including Louis Vuitton as well as Nike, Levi and Vans, gets over 60% of its revenue from the online business. The deal, which is expected to be completed late in 2020, is anticipated to contribute at least $500 million of revenue and adjusted earnings per share of 20 cents in fiscal 2022. Supreme does not provide group sales or profit figures but its UK-based European arm is obliged to publish annual accounts and these have showed rapid growth and industry-leading margins in recent years. In the year to the end of January 2019, Supreme’s European business racked up revenue of 100 million pounds ($130 million) despite having just two stores and a profit margin, before interest expenses, of 44% - a multiple of the margins earned by other streetwear brands like Vans, Abercrombie & Fitch or even luxury brands like Gucci, company filings show. Analysts have wondered whether Supreme will be able to maintain its premium pricing as its products become more ubiquitous, but were more sanguine after Monday’s announcement. “Supreme is a strong streetwear brand .... and while the brand has built its appeal on scarcity, we believe the market will be excited at the margin and growth profile and its contribution to VFC,” Bernstein analyst Jaime Merriman said."

Shares fell about 4% before the bell, as the company also did not provide an outlook for its fiscal 2021, citing uncertainty over the duration and severity of the health crisis. “Through the first 10 months of fiscal 2020 our business delivered results above our stated long-term growth objectives. Then the world changed for all of us as a result of COVID-19,” Chief Executive Officer Steve Rendle said in a statement. VF said its suppliers, including third-party manufacturers, logistics providers and other vendors, have also been hit and that many of its facilities were operating at a reduced capacity. Retail stores in the Asia-Pacific region, including China, have reopened, the company said, adding that retail store traffic has improved recently, but remains significantly lower than last year. In Europe, Middle East and Africa, the company has started a phased reopening of its retail stores and is preparing for a gradual restart in North America. It expects most of its stores to be open by mid-2020. Several retail and department stores that sell the company’s merchandise were also closed, forcing the company to limit business to its online offerings. The Denver, Colorado-based company said it expects free cash flow to exceed $600 million in the current first quarter. For the fourth quarter ended March, the company reported a net loss of $483.8 million, or $1.22 per share, compared with a profit of $128.8 million, or 32 cents per share, a year earlier, as it discontinued some operations. Excluding one-time items, the company earned 10 cents per share, compared with the average analyst estimate of 14 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Net revenue fell about 2% to $2.10 billion, missing estimate of $2.28 billion."

-35.92722389836734," VF Corp cuts forecast on weak Timberland, slowing Vans; shares fall (Reuters) - VF Corp VFC.N trimmed its full-year forecasts on Thursday, as the apparel maker struggles with waning demand for its Timberland outerwear and slowing growth at Vans. Shares dropped 8% in morning trading as the company also fell short of quarterly sales estimates. The results come as the 120-year-old company has been spending heavily on marketing, launching new products and improving its online presence to fend off larger rivals Nike NKE.N and Under Armour UAA.N. Vans, the company’s biggest brand, posted its slowest revenue growth in two years at 12% in the third quarter, amid new launches that included a sneaker line inspired by skater Anthony van Engelen. The outdoor segment, which includes Timberland and The North Face brands, reported revenue of $1.66 billion, missing the average analyst estimate of $1.7 billion. “This morning’s results suggest the greater need to pare back the underperforming aspect of the (outdoor) portfolio,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Kate Fitzsimons said. Timberland, a brand VF calls one of its “top four,” was particularly hit, falling 5% globally due to weakness in online sales, leading the company to cut its full-year revenue forecast for the business. Sales fell in the Americas, and Europe and Middle East, while they were flat in the Asia-Pacific region. VF now expects full-revenue at the brand to decline 1% to 2%, compared with a 1% to 2% rise expected earlier. Revenue growth in The North Face brand near halved from a year earlier. An uptick in promotional activity, starting pretty early and specifically with our cold weather brands, hit North Face and Timberland, Chief Financial Officer Scott Roe said on a post-earnings call. The company estimated annual revenue of $11.75 billion, compared with its prior forecast of $11.8 billion. It projected adjusted profit per share to be about $3.30, lower than its prior range of $3.32 to $3.37. Wedbush analyst Christopher Svezia called the lowered outlook a rarity for the company over the last several years. VF, which spun off its jeans business as Kontoor Brands KB.N in May, is pushing ahead with divesting its non-core brands. The company announced on Tuesday a review for nine workwear brands, including Red Kap and Bulwark. Net revenue rose 4.6% to $3.38 billion in the three months ended Dec. 28, but fell short of the average analyst estimate of $3.43 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Excluding items, the company earned $1.23 per share, beating estimates of $1.21."

The company said the brands under review represented about $865 million of its total fiscal 2019 revenue of $13.85 billion and about 50% of the workwear segment’s sales. It also said divesting the brands, including VF Solutions that sells uniform to businesses and governmental organizations, would give it financial flexibility to plan future divestments.

The company didn't benefit significantly from its move to ramp up direct selling and boost online business to compete with larger players such as Nike NKE.N and Under Armour UAA.N that pulled in more customers with new launches and a stronger digital presence. VF Corp’s unchanged full-year sales and earnings forecast, reflecting a 7-cents hit from higher tariffs, the ongoing disruption in Hong Kong and a stronger dollar, also disappointed investors. Shares of the Colorado-based company, which in May spun off its less profitable jeans business, Kontoor Brands KB.N, were down 7% at $84.48, having gained 35.25% so far this year. VF Corp has been trying to reduce its reliance on China imports as consumer-facing brands start to come in the range of fire of the latest round of proposed U.S.-China tariffs on $300 billion worth of goods that target apparel and footwear. Chief Financial Officer Scott Roe said on a call with analysts the company plans to keep its sourcing from the country at about 4% next year, down from 7% presently. Revenue from Vans grew 14% in the second quarter ended Sept. 28, slowing from a growth of 26% last year, while that from its work segment, which includes brands Dickies and Timberland, fell 4%. Profit dropped 24% in the segment prompting VF Corp to cut full-year outlook for the unit. Net income rose to $649 million, or $1.61 per share, from $507.1 million, or $1.26 per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned $1.26, missing the average analyst estimate of $1.31.

Shares of the company, which reported its first results since spinning off of its less-profitable jeans business in May, rose as much as 3.7% in morning trade. VF has been introducing new collections under its high-margin Vans and North Face brands as well as investing in its digital capabilities and new store openings. Vans, in particular, has been creating buzz with its new Harry Potter collection, sneaker lines inspired by Mexican artist Frida Kahlo and late rock singer David Bowie. The efforts helped Vans revenue jump 20% in the first quarter. Revenue at North Face also rose 9%. Bernstein analyst Jamie Merriman said that first-quarter results will be reassuring for VFC bulls, given the growth in Vans and the uptick in North Face. The company now projects 2020 fiscal revenue from North Face to grow by 8% to 9%, and that from Vans by 11% to 13%. “We are confident in Vans’ ability to sustain its trajectory above our long-term target,” said Chief Executive officer Steve Rendle in a conference call with analysts. Rendle said VF would invest $20 million more this fiscal year in launching North Face’s new waterproof outerwear called FutureLight in fall. VF forecast full-year adjusted profit from continuing operations to be in the range of $3.32 to $3.37 per share, compared with its previous forecast of $3.30 to $3.35.

-4.1788073501196035," VF Corp's 2020 forecast disappoints as demand for Vans sneakers slows (Reuters) - Apparel maker VF Corp forecast full-year revenue and profit below expectations on slowing demand for its popular outdoor wear label North Face and sneaker brand Vans, sending its shares down about 7%. The company wants to better focus on the high-margin brands, and is, therefore, spinning off its less profitable jeans business, including Lee and Wrangler brands. The separation will be completed this week. The company launched new collections under the brands to drives sales, kept a tight lid on inventories and sold at full price. But the efforts didn’t pay off. The company now expects sales growth in its active segment, which includes Vans, to slowdown further. VF Corp forecast 2020 revenue in the range of $11.7 billion to $11.8 billion, much below analysts’ estimates of $14.6 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Full-year sales for the company’s active segment are expected at 6% to 7%, compared with a 16% growth in 2019 “The fact that Vans as the largest brand in the portfolio is likely guided to its longer term 10-12% run rate with this outlook, there likely is some conservatism embedded in that outlook coming off of 24% growth in FY19,” said RBC analyst Kate Fitzsimons. The company also forecast 4% to 5% sales growth in outdoor segment that includes North Face, compared with a 9% increase in 2019. VF Corp said it expects full-year adjusted profit in the range of $3.30 to $3.35 per share. Analysts were expecting a profit of $4.25.

16.74041170130571," VF Corp raises full-year forecasts on continuing Vans demand (Reuters) - Apparel maker VF Corp VFC.N raised its full-year revenue and profit forecast on Friday, as demand for its high-margin, popular Vans sneakers continues to boost sales, sending the company's shares up as much as 15 percent. Vans has had a surge in demand in the last two years as VF cut inventory and launched new sneakers, including a line decorated with satin brocade, to appeal to fashion conscious millennials. The brand’s popularity highlights how shoe makers have benefited from “sneaker culture” growing around the globe that has given them the luxury of being able to charge high prices for new and retro styles. Nike Inc NKE.N saw its Jordan brand return to growth in its last reported quarter, while Skechers USA Inc SKX.N was boosted by the resurgence of the chunky shoe trend among fashion-conscious consumers. However, VF’s Chief Financial Officer Scott Roe expects Vans, which saw a 25 percent jump in revenue during the holiday quarter, to grow at a low double-digit rate in fiscal 2020. “At some point, the laws of gravity do re-establish themselves,” Roe said. The company raised its full-year adjusted earnings forecast to $3.73 per share from a prior estimate of $3.65. VF also increased its full-year revenue forecast by $100 million to $13.8 billion. Analysts on average were expecting full-year earnings of $3.68 per share on revenue of $13.76 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Net revenue, also boosted by growth at the company’s North Face and Timberland brands, rose nearly 8 percent to $3.94 billion, beating Wall Street estimates of $3.87 billion. On an adjusted basis, the company earned $1.31 per share, in the third quarter ended Dec. 29, beating analysts’ expectations of $1.10.

In August, VF said it would spin off its less profitable Wrangler and Lee jeans into a publicly traded company, allowing it to focus on Vans and its outdoor wear businesses to help improve profit margins. On Friday, it said revenue for the year from its jeans business will fall in a range of 1 to 2 percent, compared with previous forecasts for flat revenue growth. Its shares were down as much as 9.1 percent at $79.09 in midday trading. They have risen roughly 18 percent year to date. Second-quarter revenue at Timberland, part of the company’s outdoor wear business, fell 2 percent, Wrangler was down 5 percent and Lee was off 9 percent. Gross margin from continuing operations decreased 10 basis points to 50.1 percent. “There is noise in this quarter, but when you zoom out and click and look at the big picture, we’re in fundamentally the same place that we thought we were,” VF Chief Financial Officer Scott Roe said when asked about the jeans business, whose spinoff will be completed in April next year. Still, its high-margin Vans business revenues rose 26 percent, and online sales for the brand grew 55 percent, lifting its second-quarter profit by a better than expected 7.5 percent. Overall, its active business revenue rose 19 percent. It also raised its full-year forecasts and increased its quarterly dividend by 11 percent. “While the results were generally strong, the lack of upside on gross margin and the deterioration in the jeans business, led by Lee ... raise some questions around the story,” Wedbush Securities analyst Christopher Svezia wrote in a note. VF has kept its inventories flowing, selling its clothes and shoes at full price and providing fresh styles to lure millennials as it tackles rising competition from the likes of Nike Inc NKE.N.

-9.574529289879433," VF to spin off Lee and Wrangler jeans into public company (Reuters) - VF Corp VFC.N, one of the world's biggest apparel makers, will spin off Lee and Wrangler jeans into a separate public company, it said on Monday, allowing it to focus on its more profitable Vans sneakers and The North Face outerwear businesses. Denims were responsible for more than half of VF’s overall profit in 2000, but have since been outpaced by skateboarder favorite Vans, which has driven much of VF’s recent growth. The spin-off, expected to be completed in the first half of 2019, will also give VF more flexibility to pursue acquisitions and explore new business areas. However, investors reacted coolly to the news, with VF’s shares falling nearly 4 percent to $92.53 on Monday afternoon. The stock has risen roughly 20 percent year to date. While VF's activity-based outdoor products business saw profit jump 15 percent in the year that ended in March, earnings from jeans slipped nearly 13 percent in the same period, as big outlets including Walmart Inc WMT.N turned to their own denim brands. “(Jeans) has been the weak link in the portfolio,” Jane Hali, head of investment research firm Jane Hali & Associates, said via email. “Now they can concentrate on the outdoor coalition and Vans, a much more unified and strong stable of brands.” The new VF, which already sold off apparel brand Nautica last year, will have annual revenue of more than $11 billion, compared to just over $2.5 billion for the jeans unit, which includes Wrangler, Lee, Rustler and Rock & Republic. The jeans company will focus on maintaining shareholders’ dividends, cutting debt and increasing sales in China and other Asian markets. Acquisitions of smaller firms are a longer-term possibility, VF said. However, the new spun-off retailer could face headwinds related to changing tastes - with some consumers souring on jeans - and U.S. negotiations on the North American Free Trade Agreement, said Ed Gribbin, U.S.-based CEO of apparel business and product development consulting firm Alvanon. “If NAFTA were to go away, that would be a significant challenge for them in the denim business,” Gribbin said. The jeans division is heavily invested in Mexico. VF will shift base to Denver while the still-to-be-named jeans maker will move to the company’s traditional base in Greensboro, North Carolina and be led by Scott Baxter, currently president of VF’s Americas West group. Baxter led VF’s jeans business from 2011 to 2015. VF, which has a market value of about $38 billion, projected a 5-cent hit to current-quarter earnings per share due to the deal. VF had considered “all options” for the jeans business including an outright sale, but decided that a spin-off would serve shareholders best, executives said on a conference call with analysts."

-15.90939356750175," VF Corp raises full-year forecast, propelled by soaring Vans sales (Reuters) - Vans shoe maker VF Corp VFC.N raised its full year revenue and earnings forecast on Friday after soaring demand for its skateboarding-culture inspired sneakers helped the company beat quarterly Wall Street estimates. The go-to brand for skateboarders, Vans is now appealing to a more fashion-conscious millennial crowd due to its updated styles, tie-ups with hip-hop artists and collaboration with Marvel comics. Vans has been especially popular with 18- to 24-year-olds with 14 percent of individuals surveyed by Cowen & Co choosing it as their footwear brand of choice trailing only behind Nike NKE.N. “Vans remains on fire,” Cowen analyst John Kernan said in a client note. Sales at the brand rose 35 percent in the quarter. VF shares rose 4.8 percent to a record-high of $93.50 in early trading In contrast, Skechers USA Inc SKX.N reported a lower-than-expected profit and gave a disappointing quarterly forecast on Thursday, sending its shares tumbling. Skechers sneakers just dont have the “cool factor” that Vans does, and appeals more to baby boomers, Jane Hali, CEO of investment research firm Jane Hali & Associates said. VF which also makes North Face apparel and Wrangler jeans raised its fiscal 2019 revenue forecast to between $13.6 billion and $13.7 billion, compared with analysts’ expectations of $13.56 billion.The Greensboro, North Carolina-based company’s total revenue rose 23 percent to $2.79 billion in the quarter ended June 30, beating analysts’ average estimate of $2.68 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

21.8673458804352," VF shares dive as investors worry jeans still a 'pain point' NEW YORK (Reuters) - VF Corp VFC.N shares slid as much as 4.5 percent on Friday as Wall Street worried about profit margins for the jeans business, with major customer Walmart Inc WMT.N turning more toward private labels. One analyst on the company’s earnings call voiced concern about an 11 percent drop in global business for VF’s Lee jeans brand. “What needs to change there to see a more steady rate of growth?” asked Piper Jaffray analyst Erinn Elisabeth Murphy. “I know you’re reworking to kind of restructure the cost basis... How should the operating margin opportunity shape over the next couple of years?” VF quarterly revenues jumped 22 percent from a year earlier due to a booming Vans shoes business, demand for North Face apparel and higher online sales, while profits excluding items just edged past Wall Street estimates. Executives said margin expansion and restructuring investments are a priority. “I know one of the primary culprits there has been Walmart,” said KeyBanc Capital Markets’ managing director Ed Yruma. “They’ve leaned more into private label, so that’s been kind of a chronic pain point for them.” Chief Executive Officer Steve Rendle told analysts on the call that VF expects relatively flat jeans wear revenue for fiscal year 2019. He said VF has ramped up efforts to elevate its most powerful brands. “We’re intensely focused on protecting and enabling the explosive growth in Vans, shepherding the positive momentum of The North Face while focusing on re-energizing growth in Timberland North America,” Rendle said. Excluding items, VF earned 67 cents per share in the quarter, beating estimates by 1 cent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue jumped 22 percent from a year earlier to $3.05 billion, surpassing analysts’ average estimate of $2.92 billion. The Greensboro, North Carolina-based company said it has been selling more products through Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O specifically for the North Face brand. The company said net income rose to $252.8 million, or 63 cents per share, from $209.2 million, or 50 cents per share, a year earlier. Shares fell as much as 4.5 percent after the earnings report, and were down 3.2 percent at $75.92 by 12:58 p.m. EDT (1658 GMT). VF aims to boost direct-to-consumer and digital businesses and direct investment to Asia, with a focus on China. “I’ve seen evidence that some of the initiatives are starting to pay off, but fundamentally, jeans has not changed. The story that we’ve been talking about for the last 12 months is still in place,” said Scott Roe, chief financial officer. For full-year fiscal 2019, the company expects revenue of $13.45 billion to $13.55 billion and adjusted earnings per share of $3.48 to $3.53. Analysts on average expect earnings of $3.48 per share and sales of $13.30 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S."
