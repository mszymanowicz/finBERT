13.917885761158368," Papua New Guinea, France's Total sign fiscal agreement for Papua LNG project MELBOURNE (Reuters) - The Papua New Guinea government and France’s Total SA on Tuesday signed a long-awaited fiscal stability agreement for the Papua LNG project, PNG Prime Minister James Marape said. After nearly two years of uncertainty over the fate of the 5.4 million tonne a year liquefied natural gas (LNG) project, Marape said the agreement would stick to terms agreed in April 2019 for the project. “It demonstrates Papua New Guinea’s commitment to the Papua LNG Project and gives comfort and encouragement to the developers to progress the project,” Marape said in a statement. Total and its partners ExxonMobil Corp and Oil Search Ltd had planned to develop Papua LNG in tandem with an expansion of Exxon’s PNG LNG in a $13 billion project adding three new production units at the PNG LNG plant, to help save billions of dollars. The plan was to double the country’s LNG exports to 16 million tonnes a year. However, Exxon has not agreed to terms sought by the government for the P’nyang gas development that was going to help feed the expansion, so Total’s Papua LNG project will go ahead with two new production units to be built at the PNG LNG site, fed by the Elk Antelope gas fields. Papua LNG would still benefit from savings by building its units at the PNG LNG site, which will also help limit its environmental impact. “These are great outcomes for all stakeholders of the project but more so the National Government,” Marape said."

11.198059704430712," Oil Search sees Total's Papua LNG advancing ahead of Exxon's P'nyang MELBOURNE/BENGALURU (Reuters) - Oil Search Ltd OSH.AX said on Thursday its stalled plan to expand gas output in Papua New Guinea would now focus on the Papua LNG project, led by Total SA TOTF.PA, in a change of tack following political ructions in Papua New Guinea. France’s Total had previously pushed to work with Exxon to double liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports from the country through a twinned $13 billion expansion of Exxon’s PNG LNG plant and development of Total’s Papua LNG project. Oil Search is a partner in both projects, which had insisted they would only go ahead together by adding three new processing units, or trains, at the PNG LNG site. Progress has been stalled by PNG Prime Minister James Marape’s push for a bigger take for the country from Exxon’s side of the project, development of the P’nyang gas field. Oil Search said it now sees Total’s Papua LNG progressing on its own, with two trains initially. “There is significant interest from all parties to simplify LNG expansion in PNG and focus on Papua LNG 2 trains,” Oil Search CEO Keiran Wulff told investors. His comments come as Marape faces a threat to his leadership, with several members of his government switching to the opposition last Friday. “Whilst PNG is certainly the land of the unexpected, recent events in PNG are worth following closely,” Wulff said. “Comments by Total, the PNG government and the PNG opposition are increasingly supportive of advancing the Papua LNG project.” Papua LNG needs to test market demand before going ahead. “We think there’s a strong increase in demand opening up in 2027” as big coal users such as Japan and South Korea seek to lower emissions, Wulff told Reuters. To meet that window, Papua LNG’s owners would have to reach a final investment decision in 2023, he said. Exxon said talks with the government on its P’nyang gas project, which was to feed a third new train at PNG LNG, are ongoing. It declined to comment on Oil Search’s remarks. “We are hopeful that we can work towards an outcome that benefits all stakeholders,” an Exxon spokesman said in emailed comments. Exxon’s PNG LNG plant has been producing at 26% above its nameplate capacity and as a result will soon need new sources of gas. As a result, P’nyang might be tapped to supply the existing PNG LNG trains instead of a third unit, Wulff said."

-15.574782253277048," Suriname's Staatsolie weighs farm-in to Total, Apache block after discovery PARAMARIBO (Reuters) - Suriname’s state-owned oil company Staatsolie is considering farming in to an offshore oil block where Apache Corp and France’s Total SA have announced a third major discovery, an executive said on Sunday. Staatsolie has the right to a stake of up to 20% in the 1.4 million acre Block 58, where Apache and Total last week announced the find at the Kwaskwasi-1 well. The stake would cost the company $1-$1.5 billion to acquire given total development costs of $6-$7 billion, acting general manager Agnes Moensi-Sokowikromo told reporters. She said that while the company is keen to participate, now may not be the best time to begin raising funds given recent downgrades to Suriname’s credit ratings. “We have to make sure that the funding is in order and that we are ready, and for that we need the state because we can’t do it alone,” Moensi-Sokowikromo said at a press conference. Suriname’s economy collapsed under former strongman Desi Bouterse, who left office last month after former Justice Minister Chan Santokhi beat him in a June election. Discoveries this year have raised hopes that oil could boost the economy of Suriname, a former Dutch colony of 575,000 people. Optimism has surged since a consortium led by Exxon Mobil Corp discovered vast amounts of oil in neighboring Guyana, where crude production began last December. Santokhi told the press conference the government expected to receive between 60%-70% of total oil revenues once production began, which the state plans to deposit into a “savings and stabilization fund.” “We have to make sure there are regulations that ensure the oil and the income from the oil will be used for sustainable development,” Santokhi said."

The Suriname discovery, dubbed “among the most anticipated in the world” by one brokerage, is seen as central to Apache’s efforts to reduce its reliance on the Alpine High venture in Texas’ Permian basin, which has suffered from diving natural gas prices. The third discovery also comes at a time when oil and gas producers across the globe are reeling under a coronavirus-led decline in energy demand that led crude prices to drop below $0 for the first time ever. “This is the best well we’ve drilled in the basin to date, with the highest net pay in the best quality reservoirs,” Apache Chief Executive Officer John Christmann said. The third major find was at the Kwaskwasi-1 well drilled offshore Suriname in Block 58, which comprises 1.4 million acres. Once operations at Kwaskwasi-1 are completed, the drilling ship will move to the fourth prospect in Block 58, Keskesi, Apache said. Apache did not provide any estimates for recoverable oil and gas. The Suriname operations are just across the border from where Exxon Mobil led discoveries off Guyana that are estimated to hold more than 8 billion barrels of oil. Former Suriname President Desi Bouterse described the discovery as a “great gift,” saying “this will be a lot of money for this small country.” Apache and Total each hold a 50% working interest in Block 58, with the U.S. producer as the operator.

Total already sells power to the Gladstone liquefied natural gas (LNG) project, in which it is a stakeholder, and wants to supply electricity to other large customers across Australia’s eastern states, it said in an application to the Australian Energy Regulator. “TGPAU’s proposed target market is the very large customer end of the market (for example industrial and government customers),” Total Gas & Power Australia (TGPAU) said in its application. The application was filed in March and released by the regulator on Monday for public comment. Total told Reuters it was applying for the licence to sell to large customers that would be interested in contracting green power. It added it was developing renewable power generation activities through its Total Eren subsidiary, which is currently building a 256 megawatt solar farm in Australia. “The quantities are foreseen to be limited, they should not exceed 2 terawatt hours annually (TWh) in the foreseeable future, compared with its sales of around more than 50 TWh in Europe,” the company said. The oil and gas major is targeting a similar market as rival Royal Dutch Shell, which last year entered the Australian power industry taking over ERM Power, the country’s No.2 energy retailer to businesses and industry.

The government said Exxon had refused to budge on the financial terms for developing the gas field and failed to come up with an offer that it could accept. The P’nyang field was key to helping feed the expansion of Exxon’s PNG LNG plant, which it operates with partners Oil Search and Santos, among others. The P’nyang agreement is one of two agreements needed for Exxon and its partners to go ahead with their $13 billion plan to expand LNG exports. The other agreement, the Papua LNG pact, was sealed with Total in September. “Exxon Mobil’s offer had barely changed from its opening offer presented last November,” Prime Minister James Marape said in a statement, adding that it was not “substantially different” from a recent LNG agreement with Total. The country is hoping Total will still go ahead with its Papua LNG project, a person close to the negotiations said. Exxon Mobil’s Papua New Guinea spokesman was not immediately available to comment. The country’s petroleum minister had said last year that the government would press Exxon for “far better” terms on the P’nyang gas project than it had with the Total agreement.

-33.79109502960173," Apache shares jump 27% on major discovery in Suriname with Total (Reuters) - Apache Corp and Total SA said on Tuesday they had made a major oil discovery in a closely watched area off the coast of South America’s Suriname, sending Apache’s shares surging nearly 27%. The discovery, dubbed “among the most anticipated in the world” by one brokerage, is seen as central to Apache’s efforts to reduce its reliance on the Alpine High venture in Texas’ Permian basin, which has suffered from diving natural gas prices. Analysts said it was impossible to ascertain as yet how much oil the well would generate but it is just over the border from Exxon Mobil-led discoveries off Guyana that are estimated to hold more than 6 billion barrels of oil. Apache said the well confirmed a geologic model with 73 meters (240 feet) of oil pay and 50 meters (164 feet) of light oil and gas condensate pay, with more appraisal planning underway. “This discovery could be really transformational for a company that has really been a laggard since the Alpine High discovery,” said Stifel analyst Michael Scialla. RBC Capital Markets analysts also called the discovery “significant”, but Cowen & Co warned it could take years for significant cash flow to reach Apache because of the deal with Total. Apache’s agreement with Total included $100 million upfront payment and expenses incurred in exploration. Apache reported a steady decline in output in the last two reported quarters of 2019, and has reduced drilling at Alpine High, warning it may move capital away from there if gas prices don’t recover. It has also pledged to spend 20% less on capital outlays this year. “It’s binary. Yesterday, Suriname was worth nothing and now: we don’t know what it’s going to be worth,” said BofA Global Research energy analyst Doug Leggate. “But the fact that they now have a discovery ... for Total, as a very large company, it is less significant. For a company of Apache’s size, this is a potential game changer.” Leggate added $8 to the brokerage’s valuation of Apache and upgraded the stock to “Buy” from “Neutral”. Suriname had not previously made any commercially viable oil discoveries, and the find also marks a potential turning point for the small country’s economy. “We have to keep our heads cool,” the country’s President Desi Bouterse said. “Let’s eliminate all negativities and find out how we can help Suriname with this enormous find of providence.”"

-46.97055882002408," Apache and Total team up for oil exploration off Suriname (Reuters) - Apache Corp and French rival Total have formed a joint venture to develop a project off Suriname, the companies said, in a deal that gives the U.S. oil and gas producer a cash injection. Apache’s Suriname offshore prospect, near the border with South America’s newest oil giant, Guyana, is a long-shot for the U.S. company, with the Total agreement providing financing to continue exploration. Apache reported this month it had reached its target depth at its first Suriname well but said only that it would drill deeper, knocking 17% off its shares in two days as investors took the news as a sign the well had no commercially viable oil. Apache shares rose 17% to $26.53 on Monday on news of the agreement. With the gain, the shares are about flat year-to-date, compared with a 28% increase in the S&P 500 index of major U.S. stocks. Exploration off Suriname is being watched closely as it is just over the border from Exxon Mobil and Hess Corp’s giant fields off the coast of Guyana estimated to hold more than 6 billion barrels of oil. Total has non-operating interests in two Guyana projects. Total said it would give Apache a bonus of $100 million when the deal closes, reimburse half of Apache’s costs to date for its first three exploration wells, and could pay more depending on further developments. Apache said it would receive $5 billion of cash carry on its first $7.5 billion of appraisal and development capital along with other considerations. Total eventually would become the operator of the wells. The deal reduces Apache’s risk if the wells prove uneconomic, according to researchers at Cowen & Co, but “significantly reduces upside value potential.” The U.S. oil producer has largely pulled back internationally to focus on its much-hyped Alpine High field in a remote corner of the Permian Shale basin, the top U.S. shale formation. However, Alpine High has been a disappointment, requiring enormous investment in pipeline infrastructure and delivering mostly natural gas at a time when prices are their lowest in more than two decades. Apache posted a $577 million loss in the first nine months of this year as it pulled back at Alpine High. Under the Suriname deal, Apache and Total will each hold a 50% working interest in Block 58. Apache will operate the first three exploration wells in the block, including the Maka Central-1 well, and subsequently transfer operations to Total."

Units at the refinery were operating at between 50% and 70% of their capacity after SRU 3 was shut due to a malfunction, the sources said. SRU 3 is expected to restart within a few days, the sources said. SRUs stand at the end of a chain of units removing sulfur from motor fuels in compliance with U.S. environmental rules. If the sulfur cannot be removed to comply with the regulations, refineries will reduce production. (Reporting by Erwin Seba; Editing by Sandra Maler and Muralikumar Anantharaman)"
9.428763477837263," French energy giant Total to buy 37% stake in India's Adani Gas BENGALURU/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - French energy giant Total SA TOTF.PA said on Monday it will buy a 37.4% stake in Indian gas distribution company Adani Gas ADAG.NS, as it looks to capitalize on India's push for cleaner sources of energy. Total will pay about $866 million for the stake in Adani Gas, which will ramp up its presence in a market that is expected to become the second biggest driver of global demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG) market, after China. The French company is the third foreign oil major to enter India's gas sector after BP Plc BP.L and Shell RDSa.L. They have come at a time when India is spending heavily to cut its carbon emissions. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set a target to more than double the share of gas in India’s energy basket to 15% by 2030, while Total has embarked on a series of deals this year to expand its liquefied natural gas (LNG) portfolio. “Total’s investment in Adani is undoubtedly a show of faith in India’s gas demand growth,” said Nicholas Browne, research director at energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie. The consultancy firm projects India’s gas demand will double to 75 billion cubic meters by 2030. It expects LNG to account for half of this demand, or just under 30 million tonnes a year of LNG, equivalent to 10% of today’s global LNG market. Total will initially buy up to 25.2% in Adani Gas from public shareholders at 149.63 rupees per share, representing an 8.7% premium to the stock’s last close and valuing the stake at 41.47 billion rupees ($585 million). Total will also buy a 12.2% stake from the Adani family, according to a regulatory filing. After the deal, the Adani family and Total will each hold 37.4% stake in Adani Gas, while public shareholders will own the remaining 25.2%. Shares of Adani Gas soared 18.4% on Monday morning after the deal was announced. After paring some gains, the shares were up more than 12% in late trading, valuing the entity at about $2.38 billion. “For Adani, this is likely to be more about de-risking an investment in expansion while also bringing in a global leader in gas and LNG (to) support this,” Browne said. Acquiring a stake in Adani Gas also gives Total potential access to two import and regasification LNG terminals in India. Speaking later at a conference in New Delhi, Total Chairman and CEO Patrick Pouyanné said the energy major was looking to capture a substantial part of the Indian gas market with Adani and that the deal would take 6 months to complete. Total was also in discussions with partners including Adani for partnership in renewable energy, he said at the India Energy Forum by CERAWeek. “The natural gas market in India will have strong growth and is an attractive outlet for the world’s second-largest LNG player that Total has become,” Pouyanné said in a separate statement. Total and Adani plan to establish a joint venture to market LNG in India and Bangladesh, the companies said. The deal marks another expansion by Total in the LNG sector, after its swift purchase of Anadarko’s Mozambique project - one of the world’s largest LNG developments - earlier this year, and last month’s decision to invest in the massive Arctic LNG 2 project in northern Russia. Total completed the acquisition of Anadarko's APC.N 26.5% stake in the Mozambique LNG project for $3.9 billion last month, while in June it took over Toshiba's 6502.T U.S. LNG business"
12.772924234421657," Brazil raises $2.2 billion in oil auction; Total, Petronas invest big RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Ten companies on Thursday agreed to pay more than $2 billion for the exploration and production rights in 12 offshore oil blocks in Brazil, in what could be a promising sign for even bigger upcoming oil auctions. The most heavily sought after areas in the Thursday auction directly border Brazil’s so-called pre-salt area, a coveted zone in which billions of barrels of oil are trapped under a thick layer of salt beneath the ocean floor. Pre-salt blocks will be up for grabs in two much larger auctions scheduled for Nov. 6 and Nov. 7, including the so-called transfer-of-rights auction, which is expected to fetch around $25 billion for the government. On Thursday, companies agreed to pay the Brazilian government 8.9 billion reais ($2.2 billion) in signing bonuses. The biggest move came from a France's Total SA TOTF.PA, which, in a consortium with Malaysia's Petronas and Qatar Petroleum, dropped 4.029 billion reais for one block abutting the pre-salt area. Total will be the operator, with a 40% stake. Those areas, known as ""fringe blocks,"" are believed to share some geology with the pre-salt area. After the auction, Mines and Energy Minister Bento Albuquerque said the results were “well above expectations,” pointing out that minimum signing bonus for all areas together combined was just 3.2 billion reais. Other significant winning bids included a bid of 1.116 billion reais by Petronas for a block in the Campos Basin, and a 2.045 billion reais bid from Brazil's Petrobras PETR4.SA and BP Plc BP.L for a separate block. Petronas made another significant move into Brazil in April, when it purchased two oilfields from state-run Petrobras for $1.29 billion. Royal Dutch Shell Plc RDSa.L, Wintershall Dea GmbH, Chevron Corp CVX.N, Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N and Repsol SA REP.MC also won at least minority stakes in exploration blocks. Twenty-four blocks, many in more marginal oil producing areas, failed to attract a bidder and will be placed in a new program the Brazilian government calls “permanent offer.” Seven blocks near the ecologically sensitive Abrolhos archipelago in northeastern Brazil received no bids, after environmental litigation involving federal prosecutors was disclosed on Wednesday. In a statement following results, Total said that while it was committed to pursuing deepwater opportunities in Brazil, in would not join other oil majors in participating in the transfer-of-rights round as the competitive process was geared toward non-operating stakes. In addition to the t10 companies that made successful bids in oil blocks, Norway's Equinor ASA EQNR.OL made one unsuccessful bid. Six companies - Murphy Oil Corp MUR.N, Enauta Partipacoes SA ENAT3.SA, Karoon Energy Ltd KAR.AX, Petrogal, Ecopetrol SA ECO.CN and China National Offshore Oil Corp Ltd 0883.HK - registered for the auction but did not place offers."

The company’s chief executive officer, Patrick Pouyanné, said in a statement that was because the competitive bidding rounds were for non-operating stakes. The Brazilian government expects to raise 106 billion reais ($25.8 billion) from the auction that is due to attract major global oil companies. A consortium led by Total won the exploration and production rights for an offshore block near the pre-salt region on Thursday, agreeing to pay the government a signing bonus of 4 billion reais ($978 million). Total plans to expand its business in Brazil in the distribution of fuels, where it made initial inroads by buying Zema Petroleo in Minas Gerais State in November, the company’s vice president for the Americas, Jean-Michel Lavergne, said. “Brazil is a very large market and joining the effort to supply gasoline to everyone in a safe, clean and cheap way is clearly one of Total’s strategic goals,” Lavergne said at an investment conference in Sao Paulo. “So we started with the purchase of a network of stations in the state of Minas Gerais, so let’s see how this works out. We will continue to study opportunities in this area,” he said.

6.61636798336496," PNG to seek more from Exxon on P'nyang deal than Total's Papua LNG TOKYO (Reuters) - Papua New Guinea will press Exxon Mobil Corp for “far better” terms on its P’nyang gas project than the government secured in a recent agreement with Total SA for its Papua LNG project, the country’s petroleum minister said. The P’nyang field will help feed an expansion of Exxon’s PNG LNG plant. If negotiations for the project are protracted, that could delay Exxon’s $13 billion plan with Total’s Papua LNG to double the country’s liquefied natural gas exports by 2024. Talks on P’nyang were put on hold earlier this year when the government sought to revise Total’s Papua LNG agreement. That deal was finally endorsed in early September, with minor concessions from Total. Formal talks on the P’nyang project have yet to begin, with the government waiting for information from Exxon, PNG Petroleum Minister Kerenga Kua told Reuters on the sidelines of the annual LNG Producer-Consumer conference in Tokyo. Asked whether the government would seek the same terms from Exxon on the P’nyang project as it secured from Total, Kua said: “It has to be better. It has to be far better. That’s the key point.” Exxon Mobil, which is also a partner in the Papua LNG project, said it is looking forward to working with the PNG government to conclude the gas agreement for the P’nyang project ahead of decisions on design work for the addition of three new processing units, called trains, at PNG LNG. “The verification of the gas agreement for the Papua LNG project confirms the commitment of all parties to make the project a success and provide value for all stakeholders,” an Exxon Mobil spokeswoman said in emailed response to Reuters when asked to comment on Kua’s remarks. The push to extract more benefits from the P’nyang project is part of a wider effort by PNG’s new government to reap more rewards from the country’s mineral and petroleum resources to lift the country out of poverty. Kua said the government would begin working with foreign investors next year to review natural resource extraction laws, which mostly stem from before PNG won independence in 1975. The country is already in the process of revising its Mining Act, and next year will look to update its petroleum legislation to match regulations in other nations that produce LNG. “In early 2020 the government will look at such changes in our regulatory set-up in close consultation with our development partners,” Kua said at the conference. “This consultation is necessary to ensure Papua New Guinea is walking forward in lock-step with its investors,” he said. “Whilst attracting FDI (foreign direct investment) in the oil and gas sector, reaping and sharing the rewards involving this valuable resource must be equitable to our development partners, investors, and the host government and its people.”"

6.6542245746556015," Papua New Guinea sticks to gas deal with Total for $13 billion project MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Papua New Guinea said on Tuesday it will honor a gas deal that Total SA signed with a previous government for a $13 billion plan to expand gas exports, after securing minor concessions from the French company. The decision removes uncertainty over the plan to double liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports from the Pacific nation that arose after new Prime Minister James Marape came to power in May promising to win more benefits for the impoverished country. The Papua LNG gas agreement is one of two agreements needed for Total and its partners, Exxon Mobil Corp and Oil Search Ltd, to go ahead with the LNG expansion plan. “The government has now cleared Total to proceed full steam ahead with the implementation of the Papua Gas Project,” Petroleum Minister Kerenga Kua said in a statement. Doubts about the gas deal escalated in August, when the government suddenly called for talks to revise the agreement. Kua said Total had made some concessions, promising to prepare a detailed plan outlining how much local equipment and services would be used in the project and to negotiate with any third party wanting access to the project’s petroleum pipelines. It would also be willing to negotiate for Papua New Guinea to take a stake in the pipelines after the state has repaid all its loans and costs on the project, and would consider buying LNG carriers in a joint venture with the state. “Most of these are substantial new concessions on potential future benefits,” Kua said. The companies had insisted that the Papua LNG gas agreement that Total signed in April should be honored, and Oil Search warned in August that costs on the project could rise if it was delayed by prolonged talks. An analyst said the government had capitulated to Total, winning only non-committal offers to consider future steps that might benefit the country. “This is a big win for the industry, but they can’t say that, because they need to let the prime minister and Kua save a little political face,” said the analyst, who declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue. The three companies welcomed the government’s decision. “We are looking forward to working with the Government of PNG to conclude the required gas agreement for the P’nyang project,” Exxon Mobil said in an emailed comment, referring to the second of the two agreements needed. Oil Search’s Managing Director Peter Botten said the project would “help deliver billions of kina in value to the PNG economy, support local businesses and provide greater employment opportunities for thousands of Papua New Guineans,” referring to the PNG currency. Shares in Oil Search, which have dropped over the past three months amid uncertainty over the gas agreements, closed 2.1% higher shortly after the government’s announcement in a flat broader market. “There should be a handsome re-rating,” Adrian Prendergast, an analyst at Morgans, said a day ahead of the announcement. “In the time the political developments have been happening it (Oil Search) has really derated more than the total value that we place on this expansion.” At Monday’s close, Oil Search shares were down about 14 percent since the previous prime minster stepped down."
6.7508095832645925," Papua New Guinea opposition leader urges prime minister to back Total gas deal MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Papua New Guinea’s opposition leader, Patrick Pruaitch, on Friday pressed the nation’s prime minister to back a gas deal with France’s Total SA rather than seek changes and delay a $13 billion expansion of the country’s gas exports. The government, led by James Marape, earlier this month suddenly called for talks with Total to revise the Papua LNG gas agreement, one of two needed for Total, Exxon Mobil Corp and their partners to go ahead with two major projects. Neither Total nor the government have disclosed the status of talks, but Total’s partner in Papua LNG, Oil Search Ltd has said the companies believe the agreement, signed with Marape’s predecessor, Peter O’Neill, should be honored. “Abrogation of the Papua LNG agreement signed in April will jeopardize prospects for PNG’s economic recovery and perpetuate the O’Neill government legacy of falling wages and employment levels,” Pruaitch said in a statement. The prime minister’s spokesman and Petroleum Minister Kerenga Kua were not immediately available for comment. A Total spokesman was not immediately available for comment. Oil Search had no comment, and Exxon Mobil has previously deferred all comment on Papua LNG to Total. Oil Search Managing Director Peter Botten said on Aug. 20 the parties aimed to conclude talks by the end of this month, as the Papua LNG project had lined up bids from contractors to do preliminary engineering and design work. But those bids are due to expire in September. The companies risk having to pull together new bids if the existing bids expire and could face higher costs if work gets delayed, Botten said. Pruaitch said earlier works on Papua LNG as well as the Wafi-Golpu copper-gold project, led by Newcrest Mining, were the main factors behind hopes for returning the PNG economy to growth of more than 4% this year after the economy contracted last year. Derailing the Papua LNG agreement, he said, would make that task extremely difficult. “The actions could act as a signal to major international investors to avoid this country. We are treading a very dangerous path,” Pruaitch, the country’s former treasurer, said."
12.307389473701921," Oil Search on tenterhooks over Total's Papua New Guinea gas deal MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Oil Search OSH.AX warned on Tuesday that costs for a $13 billion plan to double gas exports from Papua New Guinea could rise if talks on a gas agreement between the government and Total SA TOTF.PA drag on beyond next week. Australia-listed Oil Search is a partner in Total's Papua LNG project and Exxon Mobil Corp's XOM.N PNG LNG project, which together aim to double LNG exports from the impoverished Pacific nation to around 16 million tonnes a year. PNG’s new petroleum minister, Kerenga Kua, last week suddenly set out to renegotiate a gas deal with Total, which the company had signed in April with the previous government. Neither side has commented on the talks held last week in Singapore. Oil Search Managing Director Peter Botten said on Tuesday further talks are planned this week and next week, with the aim of reaching an agreement by the end of August. “It’s a dynamic environment at the moment,” said Botten, who was in Singapore during the talks, adding that he had been fully briefed on them. He declined to comment on what issues have yet to be resolved or say how confident he was a deal would be done by the end of next week. “I’m not going to put odds on it,” Botten told Reuters in an interview. “We’re doing whatever we can to work with whoever we can to try and get this resolved as quickly as possible. Time is running out though.” Botten has led Oil Search, PNG’s biggest company, for 26 years and has faced delays on projects before, but said the current uncertainty was rare in a country that has had a “very stable fiscal regime” for many years. “It’s unusual that this is happening at such a critical time in the project.” The Papua LNG project had already lined up bids from contractors to do preliminary engineering and design work, but those are due to expire in September, he said. The companies risk having to pull together new bids if the existing bids fall over, and could face higher costs. “It would be done in a market that probably would have a higher level of expenditure as the capacity in the market gets soaked up by new projects in other parts of the world,” Botten said. Oil Search on Tuesday reported its half-year profit more than doubled to $161.9 million for the six months ended June 30 from a year earlier, just ahead of a consensus estimate of $160 million, on strong output from the PNG LNG project and higher oil-linked LNG prices. The result last year was hurt by a shut down of PNG LNG following a major earthquake. The review of the Papua LNG agreement, a joint venture between Total, Exxon Mobil and Oil Search, has delayed talks on another gas agreement, for the P’nyang field, also needed for the LNG expansion. Delays on both could push out a final investment decision on the expansion beyond the companies’ target of 2020."

-10.210551842577399," Tellurian, Total finalize Louisiana Driftwood LNG export plant agreements (Reuters) - U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) developer Tellurian Inc said on Wednesday that units of French oil major Total SA have agreed to buy LNG from the U.S. company’s proposed $30 billion Driftwood export project in Louisiana. Total will buy one million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG from Driftwood and invest $500 million in Driftwood Holdings LP, it said in a statement. Total will also buy an additional 1.5 mtpa of LNG from Tellurian’s offtake volumes from Driftwood. The deal involves LNG free on board at a price based on the Platts Japan Korea Marker (JKM). Tellurian said it planned to make a final investment decision this year on whether to build Driftwood, which would enable the plant to enter service in 2023. “The agreements we have executed with Total confirm the business model for the Driftwood project, establishing it as an LNG joint venture partnership with an implied value of $13.8 billion,” Tellurian President and Chief Executive Meg Gentle said in the statement. Driftwood is designed to produce 27.6 mtpa of LNG or about 4 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) of natural gas. One billion cubic feet of gas is enough to fuel about 5 million U.S. homes for a day. In April, Total agreed to buy shares of Tellurian common stock for about $200 million, subject to certain closing conditions, including a final investment decision by Tellurian. Tellurian said Total’s aggregate investment in the Tellurian portfolio will be about $907 million at the time of the final decision to build the plant. Driftwood is one of about a dozen U.S. LNG export projects that said they could make final investment decisions in 2019. Together the plants, which analysts said will not all be built, would produce over 150 mtpa of LNG. Total world demand for LNG reached a record 316 mtpa in 2018 and is projected to soar by about 100 mtpa by 2023, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Unlike most proposed U.S. LNG export projects that will liquefy gas for a fee, Tellurian is offering customers the opportunity invest in a full range of services from production to pipelines and liquefaction. Current partners include units of Total, Vitol, Petronet LNG Ltd, General Electric Co and Bechtel, which has a $15.2 billion contract to build the liquefaction facility. Pipelines, reserves and other expenses make up the rest of the project’s cost."
-6.512368686042117," Papua New Guinea treasurer calls for more benefits from LNG, mining projects MELBOURNE, June 26 (Reuters) - Papua New Guinea’s new treasurer on Wednesday put Total SA, Exxon Mobil Corp , Newcrest Mining and their partners on notice that the country wants to extract more benefits from their gas and mining projects. Treasurer Sam Basil said the country also needs better forecasts from Exxon and Total on the expected income flow from a $13 billion plan to double the country’s liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports. Basil was appointed earlier this month by Prime Minister James Marape, who led a revolt against former prime minister Peter O’Neill in May. France’s Total is leading the Papua LNG project, which will develop the Elk-Antelope gas fields to feed two new LNG production units to be sited at the PNG LNG plant, run by Exxon. At the same time, Exxon and its partners plan to add a third new unit at PNG LNG, which will partly be fed by another new field, P’nyang. Total recently reached an agreement with the government setting terms for its Papua LNG project, while Exxon is in the process of negotiating a separate agreement with the government for P’nyang. Treasurer Basil said the projects should all be treated as one, rather than “under the cloak of separate joint ventures”. “I am putting each of the project partners in all of these projects on notice that the concerns of our people must be addressed through dialogue and negotiations with the state and that we expect all parties to contribute to a fair and equitable outcome,” he said. Exxon’s original $19 billion PNG LNG project is the biggest foreign investment in the country and crucial to the economy, but the plant has been a disappointing contributor since it started exporting LNG in 2014. Last year’s earthquake which forced a shutdown of PNG LNG dented the government’s take from the project more than Exxon had expected it would. The 2019 budget had assumed that oil and gas sector revenue would fall by 9.4 pct from 2018, but it actually fell by 16.4 percent, Basil said. He plans to ask the Treasury and Exxon to come up with new detailed forecasts of future cash flows from the project to the national and provincial governments and local landowners. He also said the government would put on hold talks with the owners of the Wafi Golpu gold project, Newcrest and South Africa’s Harmony Gold, until the state negotiating team has talked to the Morobe provincial government about its aspirations for the project. “Our future prosperity depends on delivering these projects and delivering them well. But we must now find a way to ensure that these major resource project agreements capture enough value to the state and to our people,” he said. Exxon and Total were not immediately available to comment. Newcrest had no immediate comment. (Reporting by Sonali Paul; Editing by Tom Hogue)"

Total, which bought A.P. Moller-Maersk’s oil and gas business in 2017, will shut production at the Tyra gas fields at the end of 2019 as part of a major redevelopment. “Unfortunately, the changes mean that a number of valued colleagues will leave us,” Patrick Gilly, managing director for Total’s Danish North Sea operations said in a statement. When the field comes back on stream in 2022, the infrastructure at Tyra will process more than 90% of the natural gas from the Danish North Sea, Total said. Before Total bought the business, Maersk had in 2017 together with its partners in the Danish Underground Consortium (DUC) decided to invest 21 billion Danish crowns ($3.2 billion) in redeveloping the Tyra gas fields - the largest ever investment in the Danish part of the North Sea. After the jobs cuts at its hub in Esbjerg, Total Exploration & Production will have around 1,300 employees at the site. Total has around 360 employees at its Copenhagen office."

Total said the launch of Mero 2, two further FPSOs of the same capacity would be added to the project subject to approval by the partners. All four producing units will be deployed in the northwestern part of the Libra block. The Mero 1 project which is currently under development was progressing as planned with a start-up expected in 2021, it said. Petrobras owns 40% of the Libra project, while Shell and Total SA each own 20%. Chinese state oil companies CNOOC Ltd and China National Petroleum Corp Ltd each hold 10 percent in the project.

-11.219977859709655," Total CEO says planned buy of Anadarko's Africa assets 'perfectly fitting' WASHINGTON (Reuters) - French energy giant Total SA’s planned acquisition of U.S. firm Anadarko’s African assets is “perfectly fitting” with the company’s overall strategy and helps play to its strengths, Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanne said on Thursday. Total agreed to buy all of Anadarko’s oil-and-gas-producing assets outside the United States, including its biggest future expense, a multibillion-dollar liquefied natural gas project in Mozambique, for $8.8 billion. The deal is contingent on the wider, $38 billion proposed takeover of Anadarko Petroleum Corp by Occidental Petroleum Corp, which last month outmaneuvered rival Chevron, the No. 2 U.S. oil producer, which had also bid for Anadarko. Speaking at an event in Washington, Pouyanne said the oil major has had its eyes on Anadarko’s Africa assets, which stretch from Algeria to South Africa, for more than a year. “What we tell to investors is we play to our strengths. What are the strengths of Total? It is the Middle East, Africa, North Sea, Deep Water. ... It is just fitting exactly and perfectly with what we announced,” Pouyanne said. Pouyanne’s move to buy Anadarko’s assets, the French firm’s biggest acquisition since taking over Elf almost two decades ago, will bolster his effort to refocus Total on operations in Africa, the North Sea, deep offshore and liquefied natural gas. “In fact...we have been looking at these assets more than a year. We have had some discussions before with Anadarko,” Pouyanne said. “It was not a lot of creativity to fix that these assets are not very well fitting for upstream and that there was a potential match between Oxy and Total.” “So it’s just a matter of sending an email to my colleague, then I was ringing her,” Pouyanne said, in apparent reference to Occidental CEO Vicki Hollub, who put together a strategy that beat Chevron, which is nearly five times larger than Occidental. Total has built up a strong balance sheet under Pouyanne since the 2014 oil price crash, giving him the firepower to swoop on Anadarko’s assets. The company has made acquisitions worth almost $20 billion in the past five years, under Pouyanne’s leadership. It took Pouyanne and a small group of advisers just days to line up Total’s bid for Anadarko’s Africa assets and by keeping those in the know to a minimum, the French CEO was able to stay flexible in negotiations, take a swift decision and ensure there were no leaks before the announcement."

-0.36940850178350537," Total, partners reach initial agreement on $13 billion Papua LNG project MELBOURNE (Reuters) - France’s Total and its partners signed a long-awaited deal with Papua New Guinea on Tuesday that will allow initial work to start on a $13 billion plan to double the country’s liquefied natural gas exports. Developing the Pacific island nation’s gas reserves is seen as crucial to its economy as LNG is its biggest export earner, while demand for the fuel is surging globally. Total’s partner Oil Search said the agreement would allow the parties to start engineering and design work for a project dubbed Papua LNG also involving Exxon Mobil. They now aim to make a final investment decision in 2020, targeting first production in 2024, Oil Search said. Patrick Pouyanne, chairman and CEO of Total, said the project would further strengthen its position in the Pacific basin and ensure its future LNG portfolio growth. Australia’s Oil Search had first hoped the agreement with the government would be sealed in 2018, as the partners race LNG projects in Canada, Mozambique, Qatar and the United States to meet an expected supply gap in Asia in the early 2020s. The agreement was delayed after an earthquake hit PNG in February 2018, which sapped government resources and slowed negotiations over issues such as how much gas from Papua LNG would be reserved for the domestic market. Papua LNG plans to develop the Elk and Antelope gas fields to feed two new production units, or trains, to be built at the PNG LNG plant run by Exxon Mobil. Total said the Papua LNG project of 5.4 million tons per annum (Mtpa) capacity will consist of two LNG trains of 2.7 Mtpa capacity each and will unlock more than 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent of natural gas resources. At the same time, Exxon Mobil plans to add a third train at PNG LNG, to be fed with gas from its existing fields and a new field, P’nyang, down the track. Together, Papua LNG and the Exxon Mobil expansion are set to roughly double exports from the PNG LNG plant to 16 million tonnes a year. Analysts estimate the overall expansion will cost around $13 billion. “It has taken longer to get the gas agreement signed than expected. But it is completed and on reasonable terms. LNG expansion is now inevitable,” Bernstein analysts said in a note. An agreement on the P’nyang development is expected to be signed in the current quarter, said a spokesman for PNG’s state-owned Kumul Petroleum. “Dialogue is ongoing with the PNG government to conclude the required gas agreement for the P’nyang project,” Exxon Mobil said in an emailed statement. Under the deal signed on Tuesday, the government will gain a 22.5 percent equity stake in the Papua LNG project. Total, Exxon and Oil Search have agreed to shoulder the government’s share of the costs incurred until a final investment decision is made. “We are particularly pleased that the joint venture partners have agreed to assist Kumul ... and that brings certainty to (Kumul) exercising its full equity entitlement of 22.5 percent,” Kumul Petroleum Managing Director Wapu Sonk said in a statement. However, the government will have to fund its equity share of the projects, which would be roughly $900 million, assuming construction is 70 percent debt financed. The agreement requires the companies to reserve around 5 percent of the gas for the domestic market, a key provision to boost power supply in the impoverished South Pacific nation."

-3.842662749580873," Argentina authorizes new gas exports to Chile BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina’s energy secretariat said on Wednesday it authorized oil companies YPF and Total to make new gas exports to neighboring Chile. The exports will take place in an eight-month period of lower local demand in Argentina. The government authorized state-controlled oil company YPF SA to send 500,000 cubic meters per day, and French company Total SA to send 1.5 million cubic meters per day, the secretariat said in a statement. The announcement came after a meeting between Argentine Energy Secretary Gustavo Lopetegui and Chilean President Sebastian Pinera in Buenos Aires. In October of last year, Argentina began exporting natural gas to Chile after a 12-year interlude. Argentina, which sits atop the world’s No. 2 shale gas reserves, was once a major supplier of natural gas to Chile, but triggered a diplomatic crisis in the mid-2000s by cutting off shipments when its own supplies ran low. “Increasing the volumes exported to Chile is the first step. Our great challenge is to continue increasing production to supply the domestic market and be able to export gas all through the year,” Lopetegui said in the statement. Representatives from YPF and Total did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Argentina exported an average of 5 million cubic meters per day during the most recent summer months when local demand is lower."

-1.4375238650030744," Australia's Oil Search banks on 2020 sign-off for major expansion MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia’s Oil Search is confident its partners ExxonMobil Corp and Total SA will be ready to sign off on two big projects in 2020 that together will double liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports from Papua New Guinea. Oil Search had first hoped the projects to fuel an expansion of Exxon Mobil’s PNG LNG plant would be approved in 2019, but talks with the government took longer than expected after an earthquake hit the country a year ago. “It was a very tough year in Papua New Guinea for a range of reasons and it started with the earthquake,” Oil Search Chief Executive Peter Botten said. The quake killed more than 100 people in the rugged highlands region of one of the world’s poorest countries, destroyed homes, roads and runways and knocked out gas and oil facilities. It also stoked long-running antagonism against the PNG LNG project, as the country’s take from the development has been much lower than anticipated and the government has been slow to pay out royalties to local communities. Some people even blamed oil and gas operations for triggering the quake. “In that context, we were doing a lot of negotiations on major projects and those sensitivities, I think, have been really well addressed,” Botten told Reuters after the company reported its annual results. Total is set to sign an agreement with the government by early April on its Papua LNG project, and Exxon Mobil is expected to follow soon after on terms for an expansion of its PNG LNG plant and development of a new gas field, P’nyang, Botten said. Total’s Elk and Antelope fields, new gas from PNG LNG fields and P’nyang are set to feed gas into three new processing units at PNG LNG, roughly doubling its output to 16 million tonnes a year, at a cost of around $13 billion, according to analysts. “I’m very confident that a 2020 final investment decision is very achievable,” Botten said. Oil Search, which has a 29 percent stake in the PNG LNG project, posted a 13 percent rise in annual profit, boosted by higher prices for its LNG and oil, which offset a loss of output after the earthquake. Net profit for the year ended Dec. 31 rose to $341.2 million from $302.1 million a year earlier, but fell short of analysts’ forecasts around $360.83 million, according to Refinitiv data. Oil Search raised its full year dividend to 10.5 cents from 9.5 cents in 2017. Oil Search’s shares fell 1.5 percent in a slightly firmer broader market. Production is expected to return to pre-quake levels in 2019 and unit production costs are forecast to fall 15-20 percent on the back of higher production, it said."

Output from Egina, which is located in waters about 1,600 meters (5,250 ft) deep, is expected to plateau at 200,000 barrels per day of oil, Total said. That rate is equivalent to about 10 percent of Nigeria’s current production. “Egina will significantly boost the group’s production and cashflow from 2019 onwards, and benefit from our strong cost reduction efforts in Nigeria where we have reduced our operating costs by 40 percent over the last four years,” Total’s head of exploration and production, Arnaud Breuillac, said. Total is betting on profitable deepwater oil and gas fields in Sub-Saharan Africa, Brazil and the U.S. Gulf area. In Africa, the company is ramping up deepwater projects in the Republic of Congo and Angola. Total forecasts output from deepwater projects will reach 500,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day by 2020 and account for more than 35 percent of cashflow in coming years, compared with about 15 percent now. Total also said it would take a decision this year on whether to invest in developing the Preowei field, located in the same block as the Egina field. Total has for almost a decade been extracting oil from a third field in the block, Akpo. It holds a 24 percent stake in the block’s lease and is the operator.

Oil industry workers were on strike for a third day on Friday at four of France’s seven refineries and unions urged employees to step up blockades to force the plants to halt production. CGT spokesman Thierry Defresne said the union will make a final proposal to negotiate bonuses with Total’s management on Saturday. “If our proposal is rejected, we will propose to striking workers the shutdown of Grandpuits, Normandy and Feyzin petrol production units at midday on Monday,” Defresne said. He added that workers at two major oil depots extended the strike at their sites on Friday evening until Monday afternoon. Support for continued action on Friday came after unions rejected on Thursday a 1.5 percent salary increase offer by oil industry federation UFIP, saying it was below the French inflation rate. A spokesman for UFIP said talks to resolve the dispute had ended late on Thursday without agreement. The CGT and fellow hard-left union FO have called on striking workers to step up blockades of refineries and fuel depots so companies are faced with supply shortages. Defresne told Reuters earlier on Friday that Total’s Grandpuits refinery south of Paris, one of the refineries where workers remain on strike, was completely blocked and had only enough crude to continue functioning until Sunday midday. He said later on Friday that the union had allowed crude deliveries at Grandpuits and Normandy refineries to keep them running at reduced output until Monday. But a Total spokeswoman said France’s CIM oil storage and dispatch services company, which supplies crude to refineries operated by Total and Exxon Mobil Corp, was working normally. “Total denies the fact that the Grandpuits refinery will run out of crude, forcing a shutdown,” she said, although she said outbound deliveries of fuel from Grandpuits were blocked. Some CIM employees staged a brief walkout on Thursday in solidarity with the striking refinery workers but they resumed work later in the day. The strike over pay and bonuses adds to challenges confronting fuel companies, which are also facing protests from the “yellow vest” movement of citizens who oppose higher fuel taxes and have sporadically blockaded oil depots this week."

The LNG expansion, which analysts estimate will cost $13 billion, is crucial to the Pacific island nation’s economy as LNG is its biggest export earner, while demand for the fuel is surging in international energy markets. Prime Minister Peter O’Neill said in the country’s capital of Port Moresby on Friday that “physical terms” had been agreed. He said negotiations over how revenue would be shared in the community and provincial governments required more work. “I’d say we are almost 50 to 60 percent through already about our understanding of revenue sharing,” O’Neill said, in response to questions from Reuters. Disagreements over land-owner rights and revenue-sharing agreements have been an almost constant feature of resource development in PNG. A non-binding memorandum of understanding (MOU) signed on Friday is basically a commitment by the government to finalise a gas agreement in early 2019, which would lead to the development of Papua LNG, run by Total. The signing was held on the sidelines of the PNG-hosted Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, where Total Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanne said he hoped to make progress on the agreement quickly. “There is still some work to be done, but we are ambitious and I’d love to come back not in two years but in 10 months or before,” Pouyanne said. Papua LNG will supply gas from the Elk-Antelope fields for two new processing units, called trains, at Exxon Mobil’s PNG LNG plant. At the same time, Exxon Mobil plans to develop gas at the P’nyang field to help fill a third new train at the plant. All together the projects will double the plant’s output to around 16 million tonnes a year. Exxon said in an emailed comment that it was pleased to see progress on the Papua LNG talks. Oil Search, a partner in both Papua LNG and PNG LNG, said all parties were “aligned on the need to ensure that new LNG developments in PNG remain competitive with other new LNG projects worldwide”. The companies are racing to start exporting from the new trains by 2024, when the LNG market is expected to need new supply to meet rapidly growing demand in Asia. But analysts say that timeline might be hard to meet as a final investment decision may not come until 2020 or 2021. “Ultimately the timeline for Papua will be dictated by Exxon’s patient and disciplined centralised decision making process, and all other parties will just need to fall in line with that,” said Credit Suisse analyst Saul Kavonic. Analysts estimate the expansion will cost around $13 billion, well below the $19.5 billion cost of the original project, which involved building a wide range of infrastructure from scratch, including a 700-km (435-mile) pipeline through the nation’s rugged highlands down to the coast. The government is aiming to strike better fiscal terms for the country than it did with Exxon Mobil’s PNG LNG project in 2009, when it was looking secure the biggest foreign investment in the country amid the global financial crisis."

The government is aiming to strike better fiscal terms for the country than it did with Exxon Mobil’s PNG LNG project in 2009, when it was looking secure the biggest foreign investment in the country amid the global financial crisis.

-9.384783203895704," Total CEO to attend Saudi conference, EDF pulls out PARIS (Reuters) - Total's TOTF.PA chief executive said on Monday he would attend an investment conference in Saudi Arabia this week, despite rising pressure on business leaders to drop out after Riyadh admitted a journalist was killed at its Istanbul consulate. Saudi Arabia has drawn strong international criticism after saying that Jamal Khashoggi, a prominent critic of Saudi rulers, was killed inside the consulate - after two weeks of denials that it had anything to do with his disappearance. “I am convinced that an ‘empty chairs at the table’ strategy serves no useful purpose, especially when it comes to respect for human rights,” Total’s CEO Patrick Pouyanné said in a statement. The French oil major’s decision comes despite President Emmanuel Macron’s decision last week to pull his finance minister out of the Future Investment Initiative conference. It contrasts with the decision of Siemens’ CEO not to attend the conference. Another French energy company, state-owned EDF EDF.PA, said late on Monday its CEO would not attend the conference, citing a conflicting meeting in Paris. Total and Saudi Aramco co-own one of the largest refining facilities in the world, the SATORP complex in the eastern Saudi city of Jubail. EDF hopes to sell a nuclear plant in Saudi Arabia and has submitted a bid in a Saudi tender for the project, along with several other nuclear vendors. Paris and Riyadh enjoy close diplomatic and commercial relations spanning energy, finance and weapons. But France, which considers Riyadh a bulwark against Iranian influence in the Middle East, now faces a delicate balancing act in its response to the incident. Macron has sought to downplay the importance of trade relations with Riyadh, saying that Saudi Arabia was not a major client of France, although from 2008-17 it was the second biggest purchaser of French arms."

-18.909954533589982," Chevron and PTTEP to face off in Thai petroleum auction BANGKOK (Reuters) - Chevron Corp and Thailand’s PTT Exploration and Production Pcl (PTTEP) will compete in the auction of Bongkot and Erawan petroleum concessions in the Gulf of Thailand after bids were submitted on Tuesday, with France’s Total SA sitting it out, the government said in a statement. In the Erawan (G1/61) concession, a joint bid from PTTEP and its partner, the UAE’s Mubadala Petroleum will face a bid from Chevron and partner Mitsui Oil Exploration, a Department of Mineral Fuels statement said. PTTEP submitted a solo bid for the Bongkot (G2/61) concession to compete with a Chevron and Mitsui’s joint bid. France’s Total SA, which has a 33.3 percent stake in the Bongkot field and previously submitted an intent to bid, did not submit bids. Auction winners will be approved by cabinet in December, the head of the Department of Mineral Fuels, Veerasak Pungrassamee, told reporters. Currently, Chevron operates the Erawan gas block and state-backed PTTEP operates the Bongkot concession, which will expire in 2022 and 2023, respectively. The gas fields have combined output of 2.1 billion cubic feet a day of gas, government data shows."
-10.322349621199738," Petrobras, Total ink deals for Brazil government share of pre-salt oil cargo RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil's state-run oil company Petrobras PETR4.SA and France's Total TOTF.PA on Friday agreed to buy millions of barrels of oil cargo from the Brazilian government, its first successful auction of its share of output from the pre-salt offshore play. The auction, held by Pre-sal Petroleo SA, the state company managing contracts for pre-salt oil development, was the government’s second attempt to sell its share of oil from three fields in the Santos offshore basin. A first attempt in May yielded no bids. On Friday, private oil majors Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.AS and Repsol-Sinopec, though registered to bid, sat on the sidelines. Oil majors have plowed top dollar into Brazil to lock in stakes in the offshore pre-salt oil play, where billions of barrels of oil are trapped under a thick layer of salt. Brazilian rules dictate that companies vying for stakes in the pre-salt area must bid by promising a share of oil production to the government. Petrobras first signed on to receive about 10.6 million barrels of oil over the next three years, which represents the government’s share of expected output from the Mero area which is located in the Santos Basin’s Libra field. It is being developed by a consortium that includes Petrobras with 40 percent, Shell and Total SA each with 20 percent, and Chinese state oil companies CNOOC Ltd and China National Petroleum Corp each holding 10 percent. Petrobras also agreed to take an expected 600,000 barrels over the next 36 months from the Sapinhoa field in the Campos basin from the government. There, Petrobras has a 40 percent stake, Repsol Sinopec has 25 percent, and Royal Dutch Shell holds 30 percent. Meanwhile, Total agreed to a 12-month contract for oil from the Lula field in the Santos basin, which should total some 1.1 million barrels. That field is operated by Petrobras, with a 65 percent stake. Shell has a 25 percent stake there while Petrogal has 10 percent."

8.658916594008785," France's Total sees natural gas demand far outpacing oil (Reuters) - French oil and gas company Total SA expects the global natural gas market to grow far faster than that for crude oil over the next two decades thanks to booming demand for the cleaner-burning fuel in Asia, an outlook that underpinned Total’s recent big investments in the space, Chief Executive Patrick Pouyanne said on Monday. Total expects to close a $1.5 billion acquisition of Engie SA’s liquefied natural gas assets in July, making it the second biggest producer of the super-cooled gas in the world behind Royal Dutch Shell Plc. “Over the next 20 years ... we see many scenarios where consumption of natural gas will grow at a pace of next to 2 percent per year, versus 1 percent or 1.5 percent for oil,” Pouyanne said at the World Gas Conference in Washington, D.C. Total’s numbers differ from those of the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which predicts global natural gas growth to average 1.5 percent per year between now and 2050, versus 0.7 percent for crude oil. When Total completes the Engie LNG acquisition, it will have 10 percent of the world LNG market, from 6 percent now. It will manage 40 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of LNG volumes, from 15.6 MTPA now and will boost the number of LNG carriers it operates to 13 from three. Pouyanne said Total is investing in the entire natural gas chain from production to liquefaction for overseas shipping, to sale as a fuel for power, petrochemicals and transport. He said the global growth the company expects is being driven by low-cost production from U.S. shale fields alongside strong demand in Asia, particularly in China. China this month threatened 25 percent tariffs on U.S. petroleum imports in response to U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods, but did not add LNG to the list. “I hope we will not lose the Chinese market,” Pouyanne said. But even if LNG was impacted by the trade dispute in the short-term, Total remained bullish, he said. “When you invest in something like LNG, you’re doing it for the next 25 or 30 years,” Pouyanne said. In an effort to create more demand for gas, Total has also invested $83.4 million to buy 25 percent of Clean Energy Fuels Corp, a distributor of compressed natural gas and LNG for transportation. As part of the deal, Pouyanne and Andrew Littlefair, CEO of Clean Energy, said Total would provide up to $100 million in a leasing program intended to place thousands of new natural gas heavy-duty trucks on the road. Although Total is looking to boost gas’ share of hydrocarbon production from 50 percent now to 60 percent in 2035, the company is still investing in oil. In March, Total closed on its Maersk Oil acquisition, making it the second biggest operator in the North Sea, while in the Gulf of Mexico the company in April acquired assets in the Cobalt International bankruptcy auction."
-2.62093663899071," France's Total plans growth along U.S. Gulf Coast in petrochemicals PORT ARTHUR, Texas (Reuters) - Adding petrochemical plants is how French energy conglomerate Total SA plans to expand along the U.S. Gulf Coast in the coming years, a company executive said on Monday. Christophe Gerondeau, country chairman for Total in the United States, described the plans at the ground-breaking ceremony for a new 1 million ton per year ethane cracker. The cracker is being built at Total’s 225,500 barrel per day (bpd) Port Arthur, Texas, refinery and alongside a joint-venture steam cracker owned by Total and BASF, the company said. The new ethane cracker will cost $1.7 billion by the time it begins production in 2020. The ethane cracker will produce ethylene from U.S. feedstock and send it to the 400,000 ton per year polyethylene plant in Bayport, Texas. Total wants to add a further 625,000 tons per year in capacity to the Bayport plant, Gerondeau said. “We are in the final approval process of that expansion,” he said. Total does not plan to add crude oil refining capacity at the Port Arthur refinery, focusing instead on petrochemical expansion, said Bernard Pinatel, president of refining and chemicals for Total. “We love the U.S. for expansion in petrochemicals,” Pinatel said. “It’s a country in which we’d like to further expand.” Tariffs proposed by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump on steel imports are not expected to impact construction of the ethane cracker, Port Arthur refinery General Manager Bryan Canfield said. “We don’t feel we’re very exposed,” Canfield said. (This version of the story corrects the ethane cracker will produce ethylene (not ethane) and send it to a polyethylene (not ethylene) plant in paragraph 5)"
10.620269445597437," Brazil denies Total license to drill Amazon basin for fourth time SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazilian environmental agency Ibama on Tuesday rejected French oil company Total SA’s application for an environmental license to drill in the ecologically sensitive Foz do Amazonas basin. It is the fourth time that Ibama has rejected the application and requested additional information. Ibama said when denying the application for a third time in August that it would give Total one last chance to clarify the application before suspending the process. On Tuesday, however, it said it would seek more information as “new facts” had come to light. Total SA did not immediately respond to request for comment. An expedition last month by environmental activists Greenpeace documented coral in the area where Total plans to drill, following the earlier discovery of a massive coral reef nearby. The agency’s refusals to accept Total’s environmental impact study has held up the company’s quest to explore the offshore basin for more than four years. The basin could contain up to 14 billion barrels of petroleum, or more than the entire proven reserves in the Gulf of Mexico, according to geologists."

3.864226073569964," France’s Total, Germany’s Siemens hope to sign Cuban LNG deal soon- sources HAVANA, April 30 (Reuters) - French energy firm Total SA and German industrial giant Siemens AG hope to sign a deal soon with Cuba to build a 600 megawatt gas-fired power plant on the island, according to diplomats and businessmen with knowledge of the talks. The two are leading a consortium that has been in negotiations with Communist-run Cuba since last year when they won a tender for the project, said the sources, who did not identify the other members “Total, with some international partners, is looking at a LNG power project in Cuba, one of several countries where Total is exploring similar LNG potentials,” the company said in a statement to Reuters. A Siemens spokesman in Germany was not immediately available for comment. The sources cautioned that many details of the project were under negotiation and that the combination of U.S. sanctions and Cuban bureaucracy meant there was no guarantee the agreement would be finalized, though they were hopeful. The potential deal is the latest example of companies from the European Union moving to take advantage of Cuba opening to foreign investment. “The EU has become Cuba’s first trade partner and was already the first in investment and development cooperation,” the European Union’s top diplomat Federica Mogherini said in January while visiting the country. Siemens signed a letter of intent with the Cuban power authority in 2016 to help modernize the grid. “With this important agreement ... we will assist and support Cuba on the development of a sustainable and modern electricity system,” Willi Meixner, head of Siemens Power and Gas division, said at the time. In the Matanzas Bay project, 124 kilometers (77 miles) east of Havana, Total would obtain the liquid gas from abroad, and then store, process and supply it to the plant, which would be built by Siemens, the sources said. The project would mean less dependence on oil and less pollution, Jorge Pinon, a Cuban energy expert at the University of Texas in Austin, said. “It could be the best decision that the Cuban government has made toward an energy policy able to react to changes in price, geopolitical events and or supply-demand disruptions,” he said. Cuba was left in the lurch when its sole oil supplier, the Soviet Union, collapsed in 1991. More recently it has been scrambling to find alternative oil supplies as ally Venezuela’s economy and oil production implode. Cuba’s total generating capacity is around 6,000 megawatts and demand is increasing due to growing tourism, digitalization and a new private sector. Around 95 percent of electricity in Cuba is generated by fossil fuels. The government has begun a program to generate 24 percent with renewable sources by 2030. Total and Siemens have engaged in commerce with the Caribbean island nation for decades. Total was the first foreign company to drill for oil just off shore in the 1990s after the Soviet Union collapsed. The company failed to find a commercially viable field. It also has a joint venture with Cuban state oil monopoly Cubapetroleo (CUPET), Elf Gas Cuba, which for 20 years has packed a liquid propane and butane gas mix into cylinders and distributes them for use by households and businesses in eastern Cuba. The Cuban state power authority, Union Electrica, and CUPET did not respond to a request for comment. (Reporting by Marc Frank Editing by Daniel Flynn and Susan Thomas)"
