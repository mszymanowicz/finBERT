839.7758823529412," U.S. solar stocks rise on Biden's clean energy focus in pre-election debate (Reuters) - U.S. solar stocks rose on Friday after U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden said in the final pre-election debate on Thursday night that if elected he plans to transition to a more climate-friendly economy. Shares of Renesola Ltd SOL.N, Jinkosolar Holding Co Ltd JKS.N, Canadian Solar Inc CSIQ.O and SunPower Corp SPWR.O were up between 2% and 3% in premarket trading. Biden and President Donald Trump were asked at their matchup in Nashville, Tennessee, what they would do to combat climate change - the first time in a presidential debate they were not asked if they believed in it or not. Biden said the country should eventually replace oil with solar, wind and other forms of non-polluting power. “I would transition from the oil industry,” Biden said, adding his plan for a more climate-friendly economy would create high-paying jobs and boost U.S. businesses. Shares of oil companies were broadly unchanged as U.S. crude CLc1 ticked up 0.4% to $40.79 with demand concerns raised by surging coronavirus cases in the United States and Europe being offset by the prospect of an extension to OPEC-led supply curbs. After the debate, Biden told reporters, “We’re not getting rid of fossil fuels.” “We’re getting of the subsidies for fossil fuels. But we’re not getting rid of fossil fuels for a long time...they’re not going to lose their jobs. Besides, a lot more jobs are going to be created in other alternatives.” Trump, during the debate, cited a federal program to plant trees and a drop in carbon emissions to say he loves the environment, but added he was not willing to harm businesses. He accused Biden of planning to ban hydraulic fracturing, a process of extracting oil and natural gas from shale that is opposed by many environmentalists. Biden, however, said he would ban fracking on federal land only."
-12.16730038022813," Up on the roof: China's Renesola bets on small-scale solar projects SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Chinese solar developer Renesola is banking on the growing appetite for small projects on city rooftops after hiving off its struggling manufacturing business last year, a senior executive told Reuters. The strategy underscores how many industry officials see solar projects on roofs and in car parks as the best available option, with chronic land shortages forcing conventional renewable power developers to take steps such as building on depleted mining areas. China’s solar sector has seen rapid growth, with newly installed capacity reaching a record 53 gigawatts last year, but manufacturers are now coming under pressure from the land constraints, falling subsidies and a decline in project approvals. “There is still a lot of room for growth - every year, there are lots of new buildings and factories, and throughout the regions there are buildings that still have no solar,” said Liang Xiaoliang, Renesola’s chief financial officer. While central government subsidies for smaller ‘distributed generation’ (DG) projects fell to 0.37 yuan per kilowatt-hour this year from 0.42 yuan, regions like Shanghai and Zhejiang are offering additional support to meet targets, he added. China’s DG capacity nearly tripled to 29.66 GW last year, spurred by growing demand from building owners, who pay zero construction costs and receive discounted power. Renesola is targeting around 400 MW of capacity in China by year-end, and does not plan to get involved in larger-scale plants. “There are land issues, (grid) interconnection issues, curtailment issues, as well as the postponed payment of subsidies,” he said, adding that a distributed project needed only two permits, compared to 11 for a large-scale plant. Though solar still struggles to compete with conventional energy sources, some expect it to achieve cost parity within just a few years. China itself has cut solar costs by 90 percent in the last decade, offsetting the subsidy declines. Liang said a project built in Xinjiang in 2011 cost about 10-11 yuan per watt, while some industry estimates now say prices could fall to as low as 1.5 yuan by 2020. The government is also offering alternative means of support, including a scheme compelling regions to ensure a fixed proportion of their power comes from renewables. Renesola, formerly a polysilicon wafer producer, last year transferred its manufacturing assets and debts to chairman Li Xianshou in exchange for additional equity, switching its business model to downstream generation projects in the process."
