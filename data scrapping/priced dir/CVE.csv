-24.32432040914296," Cenovus Energy signs crude-by-rail transport deals with CN, CP (Reuters) - Cenovus Energy Inc said on Wednesday that it had signed three-year deals with Canada’s two major railways to transport roughly 100,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude from Northern Alberta to the U.S. Gulf Coast. The major Canadian energy producer will start shipments on Canadian National Railway Co from its Bruderheim Energy terminal in the fourth quarter of this year, and on Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd through USD Partner LP’s Hardisty, Alberta terminal in the second quarter of 2019. Reuters exclusively reported earlier this month that Cenovus had signed a deal to move more crude on CN Rail. The deals come as the discount on Canadian heavy oil has spread to $42, its widest point on record, as rising production from Alberta’s oil sands has run up against full pipelines, leading to swelling volumes in storage. “Our rail strategy provides a means of mitigating the price impact of pipeline congestion,” said Cenovus Chief Executive Alex Pourbaix in a statement. “While we remain confident new pipeline capacity will be constructed, these rail agreements will help get our oil to higher-price markets.” There are three major Canadian oil pipeline projects in the works, though all have been hit with delays and the first likely to be in service is not expected online until late 2019 at the earliest. Pipelines are the cheapest mode to transport oil to market. Cenovus said it expects all-in costs to transport the oil from Alberta to the Gulf Coast under the rail deals to be in the mid-to-high teens in U.S. dollars. That pricing is in line with what the company has been guiding, said Phil Skolnick, an analyst with Eight Capital, in an email. “This should start to help differentials and sentiment, in our view,” Skolnick said, adding he expects further oil by rail deals to be announced. Houston-based USD Partners separately said it had signed a four-year extension with Cenovus boosting the oil producer’s contracted loading capacity at its Hardisty rail terminal. Reuters reported earlier this month that USD Partners is moving ahead with an expansion at that terminal, which will boost capacity by 50 percent, or one more 120-car unit train per day. Canada’s crude by rail exports hit record levels above 200,000 bpd in June. They are expected to rise to more than 300,000 bpd by year end and continue climbing sharply through 2019."

-13.60438480912565," Exclusive: Cenovus inks deal to move more crude on Canadian National Railway - source VANCOUVER/WINNIPEG (Reuters) - Cenovus Energy Inc CVE.TO, a major Canadian oil producer, has signed a deal to move more crude with the Canadian National Railway Co CNR.TO, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. The deal is one of many being quietly signed that, along with the expedited deliveries of new locomotives, will help boost Canada’s crude-by-rail shipments 50 percent by year end, a government consultant told Reuters separately. The source said the Cenovus-CN deal was inked days before a Canadian court last week overturned the approval of the Trans Mountain oil pipeline expansion. Shipper commitments put CN and smaller rival Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd CP.TO in position to collectively move more than 300,000 barrels per day by December, said Greg Stringham, a consultant who mediated talks among oil producers and railways for the Alberta government this year. Stringham did not directly address the Cenovus deal, but said new crude-by-rail “contracts are being signed. Not all of those been disclosed yet, but it is continuing.” The railways, burned a few years ago when booming demand for crude-by-rail vanished as oil prices fell and pipeline space opened, are now seeking rich multi-year, take-or-pay deals from producers. The 300,000 bpd would be 50 percent higher than June’s record 200,000 bpd and double 150,000 bpd achieved in December 2017. It is expected to further increase in 2019 as locomotive orders start to catch up with demand. The two railways and Cenovus declined to comment. The source declined to be identified as the deal is not public. Cenovus CEO Alex Pourbaix said in July that he was considering a multi-year commitment to move 50,000 to 60,000 bpd by rail. Cenovus shares rebounded to trade up as much as 0.86 percent soon after the news. Earlier in the day, they had fallen 6.4 percent after Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock to sell. CN shares were down 0.5 percent. Increased crude shipping by rail, while still far short of Western Canada’s rail-loading capacity of nearly 1 million bpd, would represent progress in moving more Canadian oil to U.S. refineries. It remains a tiny fraction of the total 3.3 million bpd on average exported, mostly to the U.S., in 2017. But as crude shipments increase, so do safety concerns. In 2013, a runaway train carrying crude exploded in the Quebec town of Lac Megantic killing 47 people. In June, some 230,000 gallons of crude spilled into an Iowa river after a train derailed. The head of Canada’s transportation regulator said last month that stronger tank cars for transporting flammable liquids should be required sooner than a 2025 deadline. Enbridge Inc's ENB.TO oversubscribed Mainline pipeline rations space each month as oil producers expand production, driving a bigger discount in Western Canada's heavy crude compared to the North American benchmark CLc1. The increased crude by rail volumes could not happen without new locomotives that the railways are placing into service faster than before. “Probably the biggest constraint that was identified was the lack of locomotives being available,” said Stringham, adding that the railways went to their suppliers and were able to cut delivery times from 24 months down to nine to 12 months. CN said on Wednesday that it had ordered an extra 60 locomotives from General Electric Co GE.N, adding to a previous deal for 200 locomotives over three years. The original order will now be completed in two years, and the additional 60 are due in 2020, CN spokesman Patrick Waldron said. Those locomotives will be used for energy transport, along with intermodal, coal and agricultural products. Western Canada’s crude inventories reached 36.3 million barrels for the week ending Aug. 31, a record level since Genscape began monitoring in 2010 as oil production expands faster than transport capacity, analyst Dylan White said."

-8.837696706969492," Exclusive: ConocoPhillips prepares to sell stake in Canada's Cenovus - sources (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips COP.N is preparing to offload its stake in Cenovus Energy Inc CVE.TO, which it acquired as part of an asset sale to the Canadian oil and gas producer last year, people familiar with the matter told Reuters. The U.S. energy company has held discussions with investment banks about appointing advisers to the sale and could offer the shares to institutional investors as early as this month, said the people. They cautioned that the precise timing would depend on market conditions and could change. If ConocoPhillips does not complete the sale in June or early July, it would then likely wait until September when institutional investors will have returned from their summer vacations, they added. The ConocoPhillips stake in Cenovus is worth C$2.6 billion ($2 billion) based on its current share price but it would likely be sold at a small discount, the sources said. It would still be one of the biggest Canadian equity share sales this year. ConocoPhillips has been actively selling assets and cutting costs in the past two years in order to cull debt and boost its dividend. It sold $17 billion in assets in 2017. When Cenovus acquired oil sands and natural gas assets from ConocoPhillips for C$17 billion last year, it took 208 million shares of Cenovus, as well as C$14.1 billion of cash. The deal made ConocoPhillips the biggest investor in the Calgary, Alberta-based company, although the U.S. oil giant has said it would not be a long-term holder of Cenovus equity. ConocoPhillips and Cenovus declined to comment. The sources declined to be identified as the information is not public. Shares of Cenovus extended their losses, to fall as much as 8.8 percent after the Reuters report. They closed down 5.7 percent at C$12.67 on Monday. The broader Canadian energy index was down 2.1 percent. Cenovus shares have had a wild ride since the acquisition, declining as investors punished the stock over the deal, which was regarded as significantly stretching the Canadian company’s finances. While still down 27 percent since the deal was announced, they have been bouncing back of late on the back of an oil price CLc1 rebound. The stock is up 24 percent in the last three months. The move follows a similar overnight stock sale by Royal Dutch Shell Plc RDSa.L, which last month sold its entire stake in Canadian Natural Resources Ltd CNQ.TO for $3.3 billion. At the time of the 2017 deal, ConocoPhillips valued its Cenovus stake at $9.41 per share based on Cenovus’ New York-listed stock. Since the May 17, 2017, transaction close, the share price has see-sawed above and below that value, although it has consistently traded higher since April 25. While overnight trades tend to be discounted from current share price levels, in order to incentivize investors, Conoco would need Cenovus’ value to be at a point where it is making money even after the discount to make the sale worthwhile. If the same 2.9 percent reduction was applied from Shell’s overnight sale of Canadian Natural Resources shares, the Cenovus stock would need to be above $9.68 to generate a profit. Conoco has also moved aggressively to get cash in other areas, including by seizing international assets controlled by Venezuelan state-controlled oil producer PDVSA. Much of the fresh cash the company has raked in has gone back to shareholders, with the company’s dividend up about 8 percent in the first quarter to 28 cents and a plan to buy back $2 billion in shares this year."
4.533316806316814," Railways ready to ease oil transport headaches: Canada's Cenovus (Reuters) - Oil and gas producer Cenovus Energy Inc CVE.TO expects Canada's railways to be able to carry more oil in the second half of this year, easing transport bottlenecks and allowing it to stick to previous annual forecasts. Cenovus, one of the biggest of Canada’s oil sands producers, said in March that it was operating at lower capacity due to the maxing out of pipelines and other routes through which it sends heavy oil south to U.S. markets. Analysts had wondered if that would threaten its previous targets for the full year, but Chief Executive Alex Pourbaix played down any danger and shares rose 6 percent in response. “Despite the temporary pullback in production in the first quarter, we still expect our oil sands volumes for the year to be within our original guidance of 364,000 to 382,000 barrels per day,” he told a conference call with analysts. “I’m really confident that as we move into the second half this year and into the first half of 2019, we’re going to be seeing very material volumes of oil moving by rail,” he added. Railways are producers’ second best option for hauling crude to the United States after pipelines but have so far been reluctant to sign the short-term contracts the oil industry favors. Pourbaix said that railway operators have hired and are training crew to handle crude shipments and have “indicated that they’re reactivating a fair amount of locomotives.” The transport bottlenecks have increased the discount buyers take for Canadian oil over U.S. light crude CLc1 and Cenovus said its differentials averaged $24.28 per barrel in the first quarter, a 67 percent jump when compared with last year. That in turn hurt profit per barrel. Netbacks, profit after subtracting transport and other expenses, averaged C$16.80 per barrel of oil equivalent in the first quarter, compared with C$21.25 a year earlier. Cenovus’ total oil sands production, however, jumped to 359,666 barrels per day in the quarter, from 181,501 barrels per day, a year earlier. “Investor attention increasingly appears to be migrating toward a much more constructive 2019 outlook,” said Raymond James analyst Chris Cox. The company posted a loss of C$914 million ($711 million), or 74 Canadian cents per share. Adjusting for some operations the company shut, the quarterly loss was 40 Canadian cents per share, while analysts on average expected a loss of 16 Canadian cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Shares of the company were trading at C$12.89 Wednesday afternoon, up 5.74 percent."
