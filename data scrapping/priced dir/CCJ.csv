39.44768387726538," Canada invests in small modular nuclear technology, eyes net-zero future OTTAWA (Reuters) - The Canadian government took a tentative step forward on its national small modular reactor (SMR) plan on Thursday, with an investment to help an Ontario company edge closer to commercializing its reactor technology. The C$20 million ($15.1 million) investment will help Terrestrial Energy complete a pre-licensing milestone for its technology, part of an effort to bring modern nuclear energy to industry, Canada’s innovation ministry said. “By helping to bring these small reactors to market, we are supporting significant environmental and economic benefits,” said Innovation Minister Navdeep Bains. The company pledged to create dozens of jobs with the funding. While SMR technology has not been widely deployed worldwide, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government has been touting it as a way to help Canada achieve net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. The modular reactors, which are fueled by uranium and use fission like traditional nuclear plants but cost far less to build, could also help reduce emissions in Canada’s energy-intensive oil patch. “SMR technologies can provide a clean energy alternative to convention coal and fossil energy generation, including in hard to decarbonize sectors like resource extraction and heavy industry,” Bains told reporters. Energy producer Suncor SU.TO said it is in general talks with Ottawa on SMRs to help power oil sand operations and other facilities, though it does not yet have specific proposals. The development of a SMR industry in Canada could also help bolster domestic uranium producers, like Saskatchewan's Cameco Inc CCO.TO, who have struggled for almost a decade in the wake of the 2011 Fukushima disaster."

3.886749527798665," Cameco may cut uranium output further as demand stalls LONDON (Reuters) - Canadian miner Cameco CCO.TO said it will hold down output until uranium prices recover and it could cut production further, although nuclear reactor life extensions in France and newbuilds in China, the UAE and Britain bring some hope. Since the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, Japan, Germany and other countries have closed dozens of reactors, which has depressed demand for nuclear fuel and forced miners to close or mothball mines as uranium prices plunged. From a $140/pound high in 2007 and about $70 just before Fukushima, uranium fell to a low of $18/lb in 2016 and has since recovered slightly to $25 today UXXc1 as miners cut output. A World Nuclear Association (WNA) report released on Thursday showed that world uranium production dropped from 62,200 tonnes in 2016 to 53,500 tonnes in 2018, with Canada, the world second-biggest producer, cutting output in half to 7,000 tonnes. “We are not restarting mines until we see a better market and we may close more capacity, although no decision has been taken yet,” Cameco CEO Tim Gitzel told Reuters at the WNA’s annual conference. Cameco earned a net profit of C$166 million after a loss of C$205 million in 2017, and has closed four mines and shed 2,000 workers. Kazakhstan, the world’s top producer with output of 21,700 tonnes in 2018, has already said it will keep 2020-2021 output stable at 2019 levels, Gitzel said. “The industry has been too slow to respond to falling demand,” state-owned uranium miner Kazatomprom’s strategy officer Riaz Rizvi said at the WNA conference. Gitzel said Chinese uranium demand will be a major, if unpredictable, driver in uranium demand. In 2003-2007, as China embarked on a major nuclear reactor construction programme, it drove up uranium prices to a peak of $140/lb, from about $10/lb in the late 90s. In 2010, China again caused a price spike as it bought some 150 million pounds of uranium in a month, the equivalent of one year’s global output, Gitzel said. Since then, China has started building its own uranium supply chain. In Namibia, it started the Husab mine and in Nov. 2018 China National Uranium Corp bought the Rossing mine in Namibia from Rio Tinto RIO.AXRIO.L. reut.rs/2lG5LqY Despite the uranium glut, Namibian output rose from 3,500 tonnes in 2016 to 5,500 tonnes last year and now accounts for more than 10% of world uranium output. The WNA’s Nuclear Fuel Report estimates that uranium demand will rise from 67,600 tonnes in 2019 to 84,850 tonnes in 2030 and 100,000 tonnes in 2040."

7.792027786946226," Top uranium producer Kazatomprom may sell 25 percent stake in London/Astana float (Reuters) - Kazakhstan’s Kazatomprom, the world’s biggest uranium producer, said it plans to float up to a 25 percent stake in an initial public offering in London and Astana, but did not confirm whether the listing was still on track for this year. The global market for IPOs has been hit by recent turmoil in financial markets, prompting a number of companies to put listing plans on hold. State-owned Kazatomprom, which accounts for 20 percent of global uranium production, hired JPMorgan last year as lead adviser for a London listing planned for 2018, Reuters reported at the time citing sources. On Monday, Kazatomprom said Credit Suisse and JPMorgan were acting as joint global coordinators and joint bookrunners in connection with the potential offering. China International Capital Corporation, Halyk Finance and Mizuho International plc were joint bookrunners. Kazakhstan, Central Asia’s biggest economy, has set an ambitious privatization program after being hard hit by the fall in world oil prices. Kazatomprom was one of three large companies slated to make public share offerings this year, alongside telecommunications firm Kazakhtelecom and flagship carrier Air Astana. Kazakhtelecom and Air Astana, however, have yet to announce details of the plans. State oil company KazMunayGaz (KMG) also plans to list in London in the second half of next year, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters last month. Kazatomprom said Kazakhstan’s sovereign wealth fund Samruk-Kazyna, its sole shareholder, would sell shares in the offering in London and Astana but would still hold at least 75 percent of the company’s issued share capital after the IPO. In a bid to develop Kazakhstan's domestic equities market, the government also wants here shares of newly privatized firms to be listed on its Astana bourse. Kazatomprom said it would list shares and potentially GDRs on the Astana International Exchange (AIX). Following recent global market turmoil, Spanish oil company Cepsa became on Monday the latest firm to postpone listing plans, in what would have been the biggest oil IPO in a decade."

-1.6310309538753942," UPDATE 1-Canadian court rules for Cameco in tax dispute, shares spike (Updates stock move, adds analyst comment and uranium industry context) Sept 27 (Reuters) - Shares of Canadian uranium producer Cameco Corp spiked 18 percent on Thursday, after the Tax Court of Canada ruled in its favor over a dispute with the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) about how much tax it pays. Cameco, which settled a U.S. tax dispute last year, came under scrutiny from Canadian tax authorities due to its offshore marketing structure. The Saskatoon, Saskatchewan-based company sells uranium to its marketing unit in Switzerland, which re-sells it to buyers, incurring less tax than the company would through its Canadian office. Cameco has said it has a marketing subsidiary there because most of its customers are located outside Canada. The court has found Cameco to be in full compliance of Canadian laws in relation to reassessments for the years 2003, 2005, and 2006, the company said in a statement late on Wednesday. “We hope CRA accepts the decision and applies it to other tax years in dispute,” Cameco Chief Executive Officer Tim Gitzel said. The decision comes as Cameco and other large uranium producers have curtailed production, with prices for the radioactive metal mired in a 7-1/2 year slump since the 2011 Fukushima meltdown led to shutdowns of all of Japan’s nuclear reactors. Some Japanese reactors have since come back online, but global uranium inventories remain high. Cameco shares jumped C$2.35 to C$15.14 in Toronto. The ruling could be worth as much as C$5 per share and means Cameco could be repaid C$303 million of the disputed amount that it deposited with CRA, pending possible appeal, BMO analyst Alexander Pearce said in a note. Since 2008, the CRA has disputed Cameco’s corporate structure and the related transfer pricing methodology for certain intercompany uranium sale and purchase agreements. For the years 2003 through 2012, the CRA had issued reassessment notices for about C$4.9 billion of additional income for tax purposes. The regulator had also issued notices for transfer pricing penalties for the years 2007 through 2011.

24.713024602088574," French Orano opens uranium conversion plant despite glut TRICASTIN, France (Reuters) - French nuclear group Orano on Monday inaugurated a 1.15 billion euro ($1.33 billion) uranium conversion plant despite huge global overcapacity for nuclear reactor fuel. State-owned Orano’s new plant in Tricastin, southern France, will account for a quarter of the world’s 60,000-tonne annual uranium hexafluoride (UF6) production capacity when it fully ramps up in 2021 and is set to have the industry’s lowest costs, the company said. UF6, produced by combining “yellowcake” uranium ore concentrate with fluorine, is a precursor of enriched uranium, which fuels the world’s nuclear plants. Following the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan, uranium prices are near decade lows as several countries reduced their reliance on nuclear energy. In November 2017, Honeywell International Inc suspended UF6 production at its 15,000-tonne capacity Metropolis, Illinois plant, the only such conversion plant in the United States. Orano, formerly called Areva, in December 2017 also halted production at its aging 15,000 ton/year capacity Comurhex conversion plant in Tricastin, and will serve utilities from its stockpiles until the new plant comes online and global overcapacity subsides. From 2019, Orano’s new conversion facility - to be called the Philippe Coste plant - will have capacity of 7,500 tonnes and output of about 5,000 tonnes. When construction is completed early 2021, it will reach full capacity of 15,000 tonnes. Orano Chief Executive Philippe Knoche told reporters that the new plant’s order book was full for the next 10 years, but added that profitability would remain challenging at current conversion rates. Following the plant closures, those rates have doubled to about $10 per kilogram over the past year, but are still too low for the industry’s long-term profitability. Knoche said French utility EDF had committed to buy about one third of the new plant’s output, while the rest would be sold mainly under long-term contracts to about 70 utilities in the United States, China, Japan, South Korea and several European countries. Ten to 20 percent of the plant’s output will be sold under short-term contracts of less than three years. The uranium will come from Areva and other companies’ mines in Niger, Kazakhstan, Canada, South Africa and Namibia. Orano board Chairman Philippe Varin said the firm’s new conversion plant had been under development for 10 years and that Orano upgraded it as part of the modernization of its fuel facilities. “This new facility is a long-term commitment,” he said. Orano and Canada’s Cameco Corp each have about a quarter of global uranium conversion capacity, with Russia’s Rosatom a bit more and China’s CNNC a bit less than a quarter each, according to industry expert estimates."
20.57516684043415," RPT-COLUMN-Uranium's rally built on supply cuts, looks overcooked for now: Russell (Repeats item published earlier with no changes to text. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.) LAUNCESTON, Australia, Sept 3 (Reuters) - One of the surprise packets in the commodity space this year has been uranium, with the spot price surging 30 percent in the past four months, a stellar performance that may not be justified by current fundamentals. Uranium stood at $26 per pound on Aug. 31, up from the low so far this year of $20, hit in mid-April. The year-to-date gain is 16.6 percent, and the metal used to power nuclear reactors is on track to record a second annual increase. This looks like a strong performance on the surface, but uranium isn’t quite like other commodity markets and it’s worth delving down to try and fathom the underlying dynamics. The most obvious factor driving the spot price has been supply cutbacks by major producers, namely Canada’s Cameco and Kazakhstan’s state-owned producer Kazatomprom . Cameco said in July it would extend indefinitely a shutdown of its McArthur River and Key Lake mines in Saskatchewan province, having initially announced a suspension of operations in November last year. Kazatomprom also said at the end of last year that it would reduce its output by 20 percent for three years starting from the beginning of 2018, as it battled a market that has been oversupplied since the nuclear shutdowns in the wake of the 2011 Fukushima disaster in Japan. The Cameco and Kazatomprom cutbacks took about 16.5 percent of annual uranium ore supply from the market, but the price action in the wake of the cutbacks is instructive. The spot price took off after Cameco’s November announcement, jumping from $20 per pound to a high of $26 by Dec. 4, a date that coincided with the news of the Kazatomprom production curbs. Once the initial surge was over, however, spot uranium drifted back down to the April low of $20 per pound, the same level it was before the output cuts were announced. It did recover somewhat thereafter, and got another shot in the arm with Cameco extending the idling of its major mines indefinitely in July. But it does appear the uranium price has been driven by the news flow, and may struggle to sustain a rally. It’s also the case that rallies built on supply cuts are rarely as enduring as those prompted by increases in demand. If the price of spot uranium does rise to around $70 a pound, as some analysts forecast, it’s likely that Cameco and Kazatomprom will simply increase output from their idled mines. But is there a positive demand case to be made for uranium? The news headlines in recent years have tended to focus on the negatives, such as the closure of Japan’s and Germany’s reactors after Fukushima, and the cost blowouts and delays on several new power plants. Almost quietly, though, substantial nuclear capacity is being added in China and elsewhere in Asia. Data from the World Nuclear Association shows that 55 reactors with a capacity of 55 gigawatts (GW) are now under construction, which compares favourably to 455 operating reactors that produce around 400 GW annually. Of the plants being built, China is leading with 12.85 GW under construction, followed by the United Arab Emirates, South Korea, India and Russia. It is worth noting that, apart from South Korea, the countries expanding their capacity have far less organised public opposition to the use of nuclear energy than countries where activists are pushing for an end to the use of the radioactive form of power generation. China is pushing nuclear power as part of its efforts to lessen reliance on polluting coal-fired generation, notwithstanding the issues surrounding the long-term safe storage of spent fuel rods. The data does point to solid growth in demand for uranium for new power plants, but this increase will be gradual and probably can be met from existing mining operations. This means that uranium producers, some of whom have enjoyed strong rallies in tandem with the spot price, may be reaching overvalued territory. Shares in Paladin Energy, the Australian producer operating mines in Africa, have gained 77.2 percent since a recent low on May 15, and explorer Boss Resources has watched its stock prices jump 105 percent since March 21. These gains look overcooked, and Paladin and Boss aren’t the only players in the uranium space that have enjoyed rallies that appear somewhat disconnected to fundamentals. Even Cameco, which in effect has become a much smaller uranium producer, has seen its share price improve with a gain of 53 percent between November last year and a recent closing peak of C$15.85 in June. But Cameco has failed to maintain those gains, and its share price has eased back to C$13.56 on Aug. 31. This perhaps just goes to show that sustained rallies cannot be built by removing supply from an oversupplied market. (Editing by Tom Hogue)"

It is worth noting that, apart from South Korea, the countries expanding their capacity have far less organised public opposition to the use of nuclear energy than countries where activists are pushing for an end to the use of the radioactive form of power generation. China is pushing nuclear power as part of its efforts to lessen reliance on polluting coal-fired generation, notwithstanding the issues surrounding the long-term safe storage of spent fuel rods. The data does point to solid growth in demand for uranium for new power plants, but this increase will be gradual and probably can be met from existing mining operations. This means that uranium producers, some of whom have enjoyed strong rallies in tandem with the spot price, may be reaching overvalued territory. Shares in Paladin Energy, the Australian producer operating mines in Africa, have gained 77.2 percent since a recent low on May 15, and explorer Boss Resources has watched its stock prices jump 105 percent since March 21. These gains look overcooked, and Paladin and Boss aren’t the only players in the uranium space that have enjoyed rallies that appear somewhat disconnected to fundamentals. Even Cameco, which in effect has become a much smaller uranium producer, has seen its share price improve with a gain of 53 percent between November last year and a recent closing peak of C$15.85 in June. But Cameco has failed to maintain those gains, and its share price has eased back to C$13.56 on Aug. 31. This perhaps just goes to show that sustained rallies cannot be built by removing supply from an oversupplied market. (Editing by Tom Hogue)"

The S&P/TSX composite index closed down 17.52 points, or 0.11 percent, at 16,144.79. The decline left the index short of matching the 12 session winning sequence achieved in 2014 and on four other occasions since 1981, according to Thomson Reuters data. The TSX, which was closed on Monday for the Victoria Day holiday, has lagged many other major stock markets in 2018. But its recent string of gains has helped lift the index to near positive territory for the year. “It is an old fashioned rally led by financials and oil companies,” said Bruce Latimer, senior equity trader at Eight Capital. “People are waking up and realizing that oil is $72 a barrel and these companies are making money.” The energy group ended 0.9 percent lower on Tuesday but is up about 28 percent since February, while the financials group, which accounts for more than one-third of the weight of the TSX, has climbed 6.5 percent since mid-April. Gains for financials have come as bond yields have moved higher. Higher bond yields reduce the value of insurance companies’ liabilities and increase net interest margins of banks. Canadian banks begin to report second quarter earnings this week. Investors will be looking to see the impact on profits of new tighter rules on mortgage lending. On Tuesday, the largest decliner on the TSX was uranium producer Cameco Corp, which fell 6.8 percent. The materials group, which includes precious and base metals miners and fertilizer companies, declined 0.6 percent. Seven of the index’s 10 main groups ended lower. Among the most active Canadian stocks by volume were Aurora Cannabis, up 5.8 percent to $8.38; Cenovus Energy , up 1.0 percent to $14.35 and Canopy Growth Co , up 9.4 percent to $39.44.

4.335265555380849," Cameco posts surprise profit on higher uranium prices (Reuters) - Canada's Cameco Corp CCO.TOCCJ.N reported a surprise profit for its first quarter on Friday, as the largest listed uranium producer benefited from higher prices and lower costs. The Saskatchewan-based company said its average price for uranium rose about 25 percent to $42.92 per pound, while sales volumes rose nearly l6 percent to 6.6 million pounds. Cameco in January suspended production from the McArthur River mine, the world’s biggest uranium mine, to cut costs and lower supply to an oversupplied uranium market. Its production fell to a third of what they were a year ago. On an adjusted basis, the company earned 6 Canadian cents per share, while analysts had expected a loss of 1 Canadian cent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net earnings were C$55 million, or 14 Canadian cents per share, in the quarter ended March 31, compared with a loss of C$18 million, or 5 Canadian cents per share, a year earlier. Earnings were helped by a C$49 million gain on the restructuring of its Inkai joint venture with Kazakhstan. Revenue rose to C$439 million from C$393 million."
