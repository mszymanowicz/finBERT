18.45059640646256," Breakingviews - BlackRock can push harder on climate change LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - BlackRock’s long road to green leadership has passed another milestone. The $9 trillion asset manager on Wednesday said it would require companies which emit lots of carbon dioxide to set nearer-term targets for cutting greenhouse gases, as well as more fully disclosing their true emissions. That’s progress, but BlackRock can still go further. The latest steps from the company led by Larry Fink help clear up a few of the uncertainties from his latest letter to company chief executives, published last month. Some lobbyists had wondered exactly what BlackRock’s chairman and chief executive meant when he said that companies should “disclose a plan for how their business model will be compatible with a net zero economy”. The fund manager’s latest edict suggests he expects heavy-polluting companies to set short- and medium-term targets for reducing emissions of carbon dioxide, rather than vague ones for 2050. They will also have to disclose the carbon discharged when customers use their products, rather than just the emissions from their production processes. This adds to the impression that BlackRock’s green turn is more than just a marketing manoeuvre. In December the group increased the number of carbon-intensive companies its stewardship team focuses on to over 1,000, from 440. It has put 191 of them on notice that it will vote against their management teams if they don’t improve their green ideas. Managers of BlackRock’s $400 billion of actively managed equity funds will be able to sell the stocks of persistent refuseniks. Even so, BlackRock remains in a sort of green limbo. Though it says it will be minded to vote more aggressively against climate slowcoaches, the proof will only come after the next round of annual shareholder meetings. Until then, sceptics will wonder why the world’s largest asset manager continues to aim for limiting global warming to “well below 2 degrees Celsius” from pre-industrial levels, rather than the more planet-friendly 1.5 degrees. They might also want to know why BlackRock doesn’t name the companies on its hit list, and why it doesn’t push for customer-emissions data from other big industries like banking. Some European fund managers require companies to set what they call “science-based targets” – independently vetted pathways to net zero. BlackRock still doesn’t. But Fink has other levers he could pull. BlackRock oversees $4 trillion of equities invested in index-tracking funds. The fund manager cannot sell shares of persistent climate laggards without threatening its obligation to track the index. However, it doesn’t follow that Fink is powerless. According to index provider MSCI’s latest annual report, BlackRock is the company’s biggest single client, supplying 11.5% of its revenue. Imagine if Fink and a host of like-minded fund managers demanded that MSCI remove the most egregious green offenders from the benchmark indexes tracked by passive funds worth trillions of dollars. The funds would then have to sell. Sceptics might protest that such a move would undermine the integrity of indexes. But BlackRock already seems sanguine about this. The company devoted some of its letter to clients in January to flagging so-called “tilted” funds which weed out heavy carbon emitters. Fink could also reasonably claim that this sort of action will help shield customers from exposure to companies which fail to adapt to a net zero world. BlackRock also has precedent for leaning on index providers. In 2018 it wrote to MSCI to request that the company retain in its indexes shares of companies with unequal voting rights, such as technology group Snap, despite proposals to exclude them. The dual-class shares stayed. The usual argument against divestment is that selling stocks will just drive assets into the hands of privately held owners or companies from countries which care less about climate change. A related concern is that if capital-starved western polluters go bust, dirtier developing-world rivals might seize their market positions. The focus on equities also detracts from the fact that heavy carbon emitters are much more dependent on bank debt and bonds for funding. Still, this doesn’t mean BlackRock should do nothing. The risk of being evicted from an index could be a last-resort stick with which to beat the biggest laggards. Armed with this threat, BlackRock’s stewardship team could press slowcoaches into making credible plans to reduce carbon emissions. And BlackRock’s $1 trillion actively managed debt portfolio gives Fink scope to push the climate-change agenda in credit markets too. If BlackRock took all of these steps, it could lay claim to be a green leader. Right now, there’s more to do."
18.45059640646256," BlackRock warns heavy polluters over emissions data before shareholder meetings LONDON (Reuters) - Polluting companies must disclose the full scope of their greenhouse gas emissions or risk confrontation with investors at their annual shareholders meetings, the world’s biggest asset manager BlackRock said on Wednesday. The warning is the first time BlackRock has publicly sought the release of so-called Scope 3 emissions data, part of its plans to hold companies more to account over climate change. Scope 3 refers to emissions generated by a company’s products or services, rather than just its own operations. For an oil company, for example, this would include the emissions created when its gasoline is used in a car. The news comes weeks after BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink made climate central to his annual letter to company CEOs, and follows a December move to scale up the number of companies it talks to on the issue. That more than doubled the number of heavy-emitting companies facing intensive talks to 1,000, although not all would face a vote against directors in the current season of shareholder meetings, with votes dependent on specific circumstances. “Where corporate disclosures are insufficient to make a thorough assessment, or a company has not provided a credible plan ... we may vote against the directors we consider responsible for climate risk oversight,” BlackRock said. “We may also support shareholder proposals that we believe address gaps in a company’s approach to climate risk and the energy transition,” it said. BlackRock has been criticised by activists for not ensuring change happens more quickly, particularly given it is often a major shareholder or even the biggest in firms it invests in. Katrin Ganswindt, a campaigner with environmental group Urgewald, said BlackRock should ditch holdings in companies that did not comply with its demands over emissions. “Potentially voting against boards is an important way for the world’s largest asset manager to take its massive responsibility seriously. However, without the actual threat of exclusion, this policy update remains yet another paper tiger,” she said. BlackRock has previously told companies it wants to see their plans for prospering in a low-carbon economy, but the latest missive provides more detail about what that entails. On target-setting, it wants to see shorter-term goals over the next five years and medium-term targets over 10 years to ensure companies’ longer-term plans are solid. It also wants decision-makers to be well-versed on climate. “We expect directors to have sufficient fluency in climate risk and the energy transition to enable the whole board – rather than a single director who is a ‘climate expert’ – to provide appropriate oversight of the company’s plan and targets,” BlackRock said."

18.283347460584736," BlackRock CEO says bullish on outlook for green investment RIYADH (Reuters) - Larry Fink, chief executive of the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock, said he was bullish about long-term investment with a focus on climate change. “Overall, I think because of the great needs of investing for climate change, and because of the pools of the savings and the great need for long-duration assets, I would say the fundamentals going forward into 2021 and beyond are pretty favourable for long-term investors.” He was speaking remotely at the Future Investment Initiative (FII) conference in Riyadh."
14.035659872499073," Breakingviews - Larry Fink flexes what green muscles he has LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Larry Fink is flexing what green muscles he has. A year ago, the BlackRock boss used his annual letter to chief executives of companies in which the world’s biggest asset manager has a stake to assert that sustainable investing was the way forward. His latest missive, published on Tuesday, develops the theme in a way that demonstrates how BlackRock is simultaneously potent and powerless. Fink’s main intervention is to require companies to show how they will reduce their carbon emissions to zero by 2050. If they all follow the $8.7 trillion asset manager’s instructions, it would go a long way to solving climate change. The more interesting part of the letter, though, is what Fink intends to do with laggards. BlackRock faces regular criticism because its funds continue to hold billions of dollars of investments in companies with coal and other carbon-heavy assets. Fink says these firms and others that drag their feet will face “heightened scrutiny”, with the implication that BlackRock will sell out if their managements don’t come up with a credible strategy. Given that New York pension funds just offloaded $4 billion of dirty assets, this threat is hardly radical. The drawback is that dumping carbon-heavy investments doesn’t help the planet if these assets end up in the hands of unlisted companies or governments that don’t share the imperative to do something about climate change. That’s why Fink’s call for private companies and public debt issuers to also disclose their decarbonisation strategies could be significant. If this catches on, polluters will have fewer places to hide. BlackRock, which oversees over $1 trillion of actively managed debt, has some scope to force the issue. The weak link in Fink’s strategy is that 90% of BlackRock’s $4.4 trillion equity portfolio is held by index-tracking passive funds which cannot sell if there are climate objections. That makes it all the more important that the group uses its clout to vote against foot-dragging executives at annual general meetings. Fink’s letter underlines a pre-existing commitment to support more shareholder resolutions. But he will need to show that he is actually doing so this year. If he doesn’t, BlackRock’s green physique will face deserved ridicule."
14.035659872499073," BlackRock's Fink warns companies they need to show a net-zero plan LONDON/BOSTON (Reuters) - Larry Fink, chief executive of the world’s biggest asset manager BlackRock, warned the companies it invests in on Tuesday they will need to show a game plan for surviving in a world aiming for net-zero carbon emissions by mid-century. In his annual letter to the management of companies across the world, Fink said they would also need to make clear how the plan is integrated into the company’s long-term strategy and reviewed by the board. To help investors prepare their portfolios for the transition to a net-zero economy, Fink flagged a number of fresh steps the asset manager would take, including, where possible, publishing scores for how its equity and bond funds are positioned to adapt to global temperature changes. The focus on companies’ net-zero strategies comes as policymakers and campaigners push asset managers to do more to hold companies to account over their climate plans, ahead of the next round of global climate talks in Scotland later this year. With $8.7 trillion in assets under management, mainly in passive funds, BlackRock has a significant stake in most large U.S. corporations and in many in other countries, giving it much influence over their decisions. “The world is moving to net zero, and BlackRock believes that our clients are best served by being at the forefront of that transition,” Fink said. “We are carbon neutral today in our own operations and are committed to supporting the goal of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 or sooner. No company can easily plan over 30 years, but we believe all companies – including BlackRock – must begin to address the transition to net zero today.” Last month BlackRock called for companies to lay out their plans to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, but Fink’s widely-read annual letter will draw more investor attention to the priorities. Methodologies for measuring temperature alignment are constantly evolving, based on new research and data specific to particular sectors and regions, Fink said in his letter. The group would also look to incorporate climate considerations into its capital markets assumptions and implement a “heightened-scrutiny model” when deciding which assets to include in its actively managed portfolios. Going forward, BlackRock would also publish details of the proportion of its assets under management that are aligned with net zero and plans to announce interim targets for the proportion it aimed to be net-zero aligned by 2030. After telling clients last year that sustainability would be the company’s new standard for investing, BlackRock introduced a policy that would see it sell out of some coal companies, although at the time many campaigners said the bar set by BlackRock to exit was not low enough. Despite pressure to take a more aggressive stance, Fink’s letter made no mention of introducing tougher thresholds, drawing criticism from some. “Larry Fink’s new net-zero commitment could be a positive step if it were paired with concrete and immediate action to stop investing in new fossil fuels. But a year after its first, extremely weak coal commitment, BlackRock has yet to announce a more ambitious policy,” said Lara Cuvelier, sustainable investment campaigner at Reclaim Finance."

The world’s biggest asset manager cited workers’ accounts of working and living conditions, the firing of a whistleblower and the virus cluster in its condemnation of the board, and said it would vote against the re-election of other directors at future meetings. In its statement, Top Glove, the world’s biggest maker of medical grade gloves, said its independent directors have served an average of six years and that the board meets regularly to discuss the pandemic and other governance matters. A BlackRock unit, BlackRock Institutional Trust Co, is the tenth biggest shareholder in Top Glove, holding 1.07% of its shares. More than 5,000 foreign workers at Top Glove were infected and one died during a coronavirus outbreak last year in what became Malaysia’s biggest cluster."
7.9385310263805975," Breakingviews - BlackRock stretch goal: real shareholder democracy NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - BlackRock has a hotline to the bosses of the world’s biggest companies, thanks to its role managing $8 trillion of other people’s money. Having helped bring stock ownership to millions of small investors, BlackRock could go one better and give those same people the power to wield their shares in company votes. More than half of BlackRock’s assets under management sit in index trackers and exchange-traded funds. The company run by Larry Fink buys and holds the shares, and bears the right to vote in shareholder meetings, though doesn’t itself gain or lose when stock prices move. Its funds typically own around 5% of big U.S. companies, from iPhone maker Apple to Utah’s Zions Bancorp. BlackRock engages with thousands of companies on topics like sustainability. But sometimes its decisions are questionable. For example, BlackRock backed Chinese companies’ proposals to enshrine the Chinese Communist Party’s interests above those of investors in 2017. Expressing views on censorship, gun safety or diversity through its governance and voting policies can also make BlackRock a political target. Republican U.S. senators seized on the firm’s climate change stance as a sign of its political leanings in 2020. Fink’s company is in part trying to channel what it hears from investors. Handing voting decisions to them directly would avoid misunderstandings. Doing so is far from simple, however, especially for products like ETFs, where BlackRock may have no direct link to the ultimate holder. The Securities and Exchange Commission considered so-called pass-through voting in the 1970s and decided it was unworkable. But technology has advanced a long way since then. BlackRock’s Aladdin software amasses data on a scale unthinkable when it was created two decades ago. Fink’s company is buying Aperio, a technology firm that lets clients manage tailored portfolios, in a step towards giving more control to individual customers. Introducing real shareholder democracy could be a worthy stretch project. Sure, asking most investors to vote on tens of thousands of director nominations and shareholder proposals is pointless. But giving them the option to do so, or to choose between BlackRock’s recommended voting preferences or alternative tailored policies, could be a selling point. There are technological, logistical and regulatory barriers to overcome. But connecting investors more directly to the companies they own could be Fink’s next contribution to finance. - This is a Breakingviews prediction for 2021.

5.7533394354759135," Europe's banks have a way to go on sustainability - BlackRock study LONDON/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Europe’s banks are not integrating climate change and other sustainability concerns into their risk management systems as quickly as regulators expect, a study by BlackRock for the European Union showed on Monday. In an interim report, BlackRock said it had analysed feedback from the region’s lenders and found most were only just starting to reflect environmental, social and governance (ESG) related risks in their internal processes. A final report, which will be used by Brussels to help develop new regulations, is due by April next year. “While interviewed banks often state that they have initiatives in place to enhance the integration of ESG risks, the majority have not formalised an ESG risk integration strategy with clear timelines and responsibilities,” it said. “With respect to climate risk, many smaller banks stated that they have not yet started its integration into risk management,” the report said. It also found that only a minority of regulators provide guidance to banks on ESG risks or reflect it in their oversight processes, such as through climate-related stress tests. “The majority of supervisors interviewed do not yet have any quantitative indicators in place to monitor and assess the exposure of supervised banks to ESG risks,” the report said. While some banks have begun to launch ESG-related products and make commitments to meet the terms of the Paris Agreement on climate, the report said that in the view of many civil society organisations, efforts by lenders so far fell short. “The Commission is committed to transparency. As promised, we published BlackRock’s interim report today,” a European Commission spokesman said. “This report is only a preliminary analysis of data collected so far. The final report is to be submitted to the Commission at a later stage.” The EU’s appointment in April of the world’s biggest asset manager to help it plan future prudential regulations has raised concerns about conflicts of interest. While the bloc’s Ombudswoman said last month that the Commission had failed to consider such conflicts properly, she did not cancel the contract.

4.926112313578923," Top investor BlackRock to expand climate talks with companies in 2021 LONDON/BOSTON (Reuters) - BlackRock on Thursday said it would more than double the number of companies it engages with over climate-related issues to over 1,000 and laid out stronger goals on other fronts for portfolio firms ahead of the upcoming shareholder meeting season. BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager with around $7.8 trillion in assets, said its enhanced target list would cover 90% of the greenhouse gas emissions linked to the operations of the companies its clients invest in, globally. It also made explicit its call for companies to lay out plans to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, in line with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. “We will step up our engagement efforts with this universe and consider accelerated voting actions should the substance of companies’ climate-related commitments and disclosures not meet our expectations,” the company said. The changes come at a time of rising pressure on companies to help address environmental and social problems. New York-based BlackRock said performing well on such sustainability measures can help companies improve long-term returns. After a year marked by growing concern over the lobbying activities of some companies, particularly around climate, BlackRock also said it would look for companies to align their lobbying activities with their public statements. It also called for them to make their boards more diverse. In addition, the money manager said it would be more likely to support some climate-related shareholder proposals than in the past - a sore point with many climate activists. In a report on Thursday, the company said it had increased its support for climate- and social-related shareholder proposals since July 1, backing 11 out of 22. “We’ve really intensified our engagement approach,” said London-based Sandy Boss, the asset manager’s top stewardship executive, who joined in April. She cited the example of Spanish airports operator Aena, where BlackRock backed a shareholder resolution calling for an annual vote on its climate plans."
1.0657720783791027," Risk assets set for positive 2021, Asia to lead: BlackRock (Reuters) - The world’s biggest asset manager, BlackRock Inc, expects the overall backdrop for risk assets to be positive in 2021, supported by easy money from central banks, with Asia well-poised to lead the post-COVID-19 recovery. Investors will continue to look for income, yields and returns, Neeraj Seth, head of Asian credit at BlackRock, which manages a record $7.8 trillion in assets, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum from Hong Kong. “Hence, countries with reasonable fundamentals and good growth potential (will be preferred),” Seth said at the Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit, 2021. Some Asian central banks will remain on a neutral-to-accommodative path in 2021, he said, adding that Indonesia, India and Malaysia may have room to ease. Seth expected bond yields in those countries to drift lower next year. Seth said it would take another 12-18 months before economic activity returned to normal, employment levels recovered and inflation started to rise. For central banks in the United States and other developed markets, he said policy normalisation was not on the horizon. Seth expected the U.S. 10-year yield to be in the 1.00%-1.50% range by the end of 2021. The fissure between emerging markets and developed countries will be driven by the fundamental trajectory of these economies and their sovereign balance sheets in a post-COVID-19 world, not by vaccine availability, Seth said. In that context, he expected Asia to grow faster than the rest of the world, led by China, South Korea, Singapore, Indonesia, Vietnam, and to some extent, India. “China, (which has) seen a meaningful recovery post-COVID-19, certainly stands out,” he said. The debts of Chinese state-owned enterprises have come into focus following defaults in recent weeks, but Seth dismissed that as “the second chapter of deleveraging” and not a system-wide risk. He expected a modest increase in inflation as economies revive, monetary and fiscal support continued and supply chains evolve. “On the other hand, you still have the combination of debt, demographics, technology, which have been and will remain the disinflationary forces in the world,” he said, adding that would remove the risk of hyperinflation.

-0.7520149393465374," EU fell short in vetting BlackRock for green banking rules, watchdog says BRUSSELS/LONDON (Reuters) - The European Commission failed to properly consider conflicts of interest when it appointed a division of BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, to help develop green banking rules, the European Union watchdog said on Wednesday. European Ombudsman Emily O’Reilly launched an inquiry after the EU executive in March appointed BlackRock, through the company’s Financial Markets Advisory unit (FMA), to produce a study that would inform EU plans to integrate sustainability into banking prudential rules. EU lawmakers and NGO Change Finance questioned BlackRock’s ability to provide impartial advice as its $7.8 trillion in assets under management includes large stakes in fossil fuel industries and in banks affected by the regulations. In a decision on Wednesday, O’Reilly stopped short of calling for the Commission to cancel the contract, but said it should have exercised “significantly more critical scrutiny” of BlackRock’s application. “Questions should have been asked about motivation, pricing strategy and whether internal measures taken by the company to prevent conflicts of interest were really adequate,” she said. Change Finance on Wednesday called for the contract to be cancelled, and published a report with NGO Corporate Europe Observatory, which said BlackRock and industry groups it is a member of have lobbied to weaken planned EU green finance rules. A BlackRock spokesman said the Commission had already publicly stated that the technical quality of FMA’s proposal underpinned the contract win. “FMA has taken a wide-ranging and inclusive approach, including academia, civil society, banks, supervisors and market practitioners, and looks forward to completing its work and delivering its final report to the Commission,” he said. The European Commission said it welcomed the Ombudsman’s findings, which did not find evidence of maladministration, and would study its recommendations in detail. “It confirms what we have said throughout this process: we applied the rules fully and fairly,” a spokesman said. BlackRock beat eight other bidders with its offer of 280,000 euros ($334,000) - roughly half the contract’s estimated value. This “exceptionally low financial offer” could be seen as an attempt to secure influence over policies, the Ombudsman said. BlackRock said it would ensure “physical segregation” of FMA to ensure information did not flow to other parts of its business. Brussels is undergoing a mammoth policy overhaul, revising energy, farming and finance regulations to better support EU plans to rapidly cut greenhouse gas emissions. Amid increased scrutiny of existing EU rules, the Ombudsman criticised the Commission last week for granting priority status to gas projects without properly assessing their climate impact."

In a research note BlackRock said that it took the step for tactical reasons. “Markets are increasingly reflecting a unified Democratic government outcome that may lead to a significant fiscal expansion,” Blackrock said. “This electoral outcome would bring forward the market pricing of the higher inflation regime that we were already reflecting in our strategic asset views.”"
12.168920707765865," BlackRock's Fink 'pretty bearish' on emerging markets NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock CEO Larry Fink said on Friday he believes emerging markets are on a downward slide as he sees strong macro trends weighing on the asset class. “I am pretty bearish on the emerging world,” Fink said at an online event hosted by the Institute of International Finance. He said the COVID-19 pandemic is taxing emerging economies and their health systems more than developed countries, de-globalization is hurting the commodity-dependent countries and the group is more sensitive to effects of climate change. “When we talk about climate change, and we think that’s a big issue and a reallocation of capital,” Fink said, “part of that reallocation of capital is movement out of the emerging world.” Outside these global macro trends, a lack of trust in EM governments is further hurting the asset class, the head of BlackRock said. “We’re seeing a flip-flop of governments. One government could raise a lot of debt, new government comes in and (there’s) different behaviors, different attitudes, and it doesn’t create any confidence for the debt holders,” Fink said. “The risk premium that you’re going to have to demand to invest in the emerging markets is growing persistently.” Following a sharp spike in March as COVID-19-related shutdowns spread all over the world, the rolling-year average premium demanded to hold EM debt rose to its highest in more than a decade. (GRAPHIC - JPMorgan EMBI Global Diversified: ) BlackRock is the world’s largest asset manager with almost $8 trillion under management. Fink added that many emerging countries are going to have to restructure their debt and their leaders are not aware of who is holding the debt and how that affects a restructuring. “I have had three or four conversations with leaders of different emerging countries... it’s like I’m telling them some facts from outer space,” Fink said."

24.318055839228634," Senate Democrats question BlackRock climate commitment BOSTON/LONDON (Reuters) - Five Democratic U.S. senators on Thursday asked BlackRock Inc BLK.N to justify why it rarely supported shareholder resolutions tied to climate change issues despite its increased focus on the environment this year. The proxy voting record of the top asset manager is “troubling and inconsistent,” according to a letter sent to Reuters by the office of U.S. Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii and signed by four others. In a statement sent by a spokesman, BlackRock said its work on behalf of clients includes both voting and engagement, or talks with corporate managers. It cited certain negative proxy votes cast this year and noted the company now more often publishes details about votes. “We are currently reviewing our engagement priorities and voting guidelines,” BlackRock said. BlackRock CEO Larry Fink in January had vowed to press companies to do more to combat climate change, underscoring the shifting moods of clients and reflecting new money pouring into sustainable investing strategies. But a pair of recent studies found that BlackRock supported climate-related proxy resolutions only around 10% of the time this year, in line with its past record. Other companies took a more aggressive tack this year, notably the asset-management arm of JPMorgan Chase & Co.JPM.N Schatz’s letter cited one of those studies and noted how in several cases BlackRock’s support for management was decisive. He also wrote that BlackRock backed nearly all directors at oil, gas and utility companies. Earlier on Thursday, speaking at an online news conference about efforts to limit climate change, BlackRock Vice Chairman Philipp Hildebrand said the company had appointed new leaders to its stewardship team. “As a result of our commitment and these changes that were implemented during this transition year, you should certainly expect that our voting engagement outputs in 2021 around climate will look materially different from the past year,” Hildebrand said."

Inflows into the iShares ESG MSCI Mexico ETF , focused on Mexican companies with strong environmental, social and governance markers, reflected growing demand from institutional investors for sustainable investment options, the world’s largest asset manager said. “The whole process of building this product in Mexico was working with MSCI and the retirement fund administrators to be able to introduce investing in ESG in their portfolios. That’s how the product came about,” said Armando Senra, head of iShares Americas in an interview. The ETF was launched on July 29 and retirement fund administrators or afores, as they are locally known, were given the green light to invest in it in August. “In our role as institutional investor, it is encouraging to have better investment vehicles that facilitate the adoption of ESG criteria,” Antonio Sibaja, executive director of investment strategies at retirement fund administrator Profuturo, said in a statement.

26.550889858657772," RPT-BlackRock, JPMorgan climate votes at odds as new rules loom BOSTON, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Top U.S. asset managers BlackRock Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co were divided in their support of climate-related proxy resolutions at corporate meetings this year, two analyses showed on Tuesday, underscoring the industry’s mixed appetite for the vehicles ahead of a key rulemaking. Both studies - done by climate-focused shareholder organizations - found BlackRock continued to offer little backing to resolutions asking companies for steps like setting emissions targets or lobbying reports. The findings prompted the organizations to complain that BlackRock hasn’t backed up its vows to prioritize climate matters earlier this year. The studies found BlackRock supported such resolutions around 10% of the time this year, about the same as in 2019. Other fund firms supported the climate-related resolutions about half the time or more, in keeping with their increased popularity, the studies of dozens of votes said. Proxy votes have drawn attention in recent years as a point of leverage for investors looking for companies to take more aggressive action on the environment or social issues. But they also can put fund firms in the awkward position of demanding changes at the same companies whose retirement assets they seek to manage. One more frequent backer of the resolutions was the asset-management arm of JPMorgan which supported them roughly half the time this year according to the separate but similar studies by activist investment firm Boston Trust Walden and by Majority Action, a liberal-leaning shareholder advocacy group. That was up from JPMorgan’s support rate of just 4% for climate resolutions in 2019 according to Walden. “I see an asset-management industry that overall is waking up to the substantial level of risk of climate change,” said Eli Kasargod-Staub, Majority Action executive director. He and Walden senior vice-president Tim Smith both said BlackRock’s climate voting record did not match its rhetoric. “It’s shocking to see their votes remain at this substandard level,” said Smith. A BlackRock spokesperson said it has spoken more frequently this year with portfolio companies on environmental matters and other issues, voted more frequently against corporate directors and given more details about its stewardship activities. BlackRock also said not all proposals are worth supporting, and that “not all shareholder proposals are created equal.” It had previously given statistics showing it took a tougher line in some proxy votes this year, especially at energy companies.] A JPMorgan spokeswoman declined to comment on its proxy votes. In February the company had outlined new initiatives for sustainable investing including more use of data. The 162 environmental and social proposals voted at shareholder meetings this year at S&P 1500 companies won average support of 27.7% and 18 passed, said proxy solicitor Georgeson, up from 2017 when 211 of them won 20.3% average support and 5 passed. Business groups - including one led by JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon - have supported making the proposals harder to file or resubmit and last November the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission voted 3-2 along partisan lines for such changes. A final vote could come Wednesday. BlackRock, known for its index funds, has taken a neutral stand on the rule changes, unlike some active management firms that oppose them. JPMorgan has not filed comments on the matter. Whatever the outcome, BlackRock and some rivals have begun to provide more details about individual votes. For instance at Delta Air Lines Inc BlackRock voted “against” a shareholder resolution calling for a company report on how its lobbying activities match goals to limit rises in global temperatures. Explaining the vote on its website, BlackRock said it expects Delta will provide more disclosures in any case and noted it is working to reduce its emissions via newer planes and the use of biofuels. The resolution drew support from 46% of shares cast, including votes from JPMorgan, securities filings show. It would have passed with the support of BlackRock, a 5% holder at the time."

For instance at Delta Air Lines Inc DAL.N BlackRock voted ""against"" a shareholder resolution calling for a company report on how its lobbying activities match goals to limit rises in global temperatures. Explaining the vote on its website, BlackRock said it expects Delta will provide more disclosures in any case and noted it is working to reduce its emissions via newer planes and the use of biofuels. The resolution drew support from 46% of shares cast, including votes from JPMorgan, securities filings show. It would have passed with the support of BlackRock, a 5% holder at the time."
28.014810685879716," JPMorgan and BlackRock tap AI startup to automate opening custody accounts LONDON (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co and BlackRock Inc have teamed up with artificial intelligence (AI) technology startup Saphyre to automate the opening of custody accounts, the companies said on Tuesday. The system, which uses AI to remember when an asset manager has already uploaded a specific document needed to open a custody account, has been tested for the past six months and will now be used by the bank with BlackRock and other asset managers. The companies believe the system will make new funds get to market quicker by streamlining what is now a heavily manual process involving reams of paperwork, spreadsheets and faxes. “The custody side, historically, has been a very traditional industry operating steadily and reliably with faxes and spreadsheets,” said Naveen TV, managing director, product development in securities services at JPMorgan. “Asset managers are starting to realize that the lack of automation is causing issues, and is actually a missed opportunity to be more efficient.” The partnership comes as large financial institutions increasingly turn to tech-savvy startups to help them automate and digitize some of their burdensome processes. JPMorgan, which has $27.4 trillion of assets under custody, took on over $1 trillion of BlackRock’s assets in 2017. The bank has securities services operations in 30 countries and a custodial network in more than 95 markets. “We are digitizing this whole pre-trade space,” said Gabino Roche, Saphyre’s chief executive. “This becomes more important in the post COVID-19 world.” In many cases, COVID-19 lockdowns have further slowed down the process of setting up custody accounts, as a lot of the documents required need to be printed and signed by multiple parties, said JPMorgan’s TV. Many financial institutions do not allow printing of sensitive documents at home and with most people working remotely documents need to be sent to various locations to get signatures, he said."
25.89591432986957," Mexico voids BlackRock consortium's bid for 'Mayan Train' project MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico declared void a tender process in which a consortium that includes U.S. investment group BlackRock Inc BLK.N was the sole bidder, to build a section of one of the government's flagship infrastructure projects, the so-called ""Mayan Train"". The 1,470-km (910-mile) train project is designed to link tourist spots and spur development on the Yucatan Peninsula at an estimated cost of $7 billion. Deemed essential infrastructure by the government, the rail project is a top priority of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who hopes it will be a major generator of jobs in the poorer south. Mexico’s National Fund for Tourism Promotion (Fonatur) initially planned to announce the decision on Aug. 31, but said it needed more time to analyze the proposal from BlackRock and its partners. “As with other projects, we participated in this tender knowing there is never a guarantee of being selected. We respect the outcome,” BlackRock said in emailed comments that called the process “open and transparent.” The Greenfield SPV VIII proposal, a consortium with BlackRock Mexico Infraestructura II and other companies, was the only bidder for the 121-km (75-mile) “section 5” that runs from Cancun to Tulum in Quintana Roo state. Fonatur said in a statement late Tuesday that the bid’s economic proposal was “not solvent” and that it would open another bidding process for “section 5” under a different scheme that has yet to be determined. BlackRock said it remains “committed to Mexico’s long-term growth and will continue to seek investment opportunities that create long-term value for our clients and the country.”"

16.884248813121655," BlackRock gets regulators' approval to set up China mutual fund unit SHANGHAI/BEIJING (Reuters) - BlackRock BLK.N has become the first global asset manager to win regulatory approval to set up a mutual fund unit in China, as Beijing throws open its 17.7 trillion yuan ($2.58 trillion) sector. The world’s biggest asset manager by assets got the green light on Aug. 21 to form a wholly-owned subsidiary in Shanghai, the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) said on its website late on Friday. The unit would expand BlackRock's presence in China's fast-growing asset management market, where it already has a mutual fund venture with Bank of China, and is setting up a wealth management venture with Temasek and China Construction Bank (CCB) 0939.HK. It also operates a private fund unit in Shanghai. China opened its giant financial sector to foreign companies this year as part of an interim trade deal with the United States signed in January. BlackRock and Neuberger Berman applied to set up mutual fund units on April 1, when Beijing scrapped foreign ownership caps in the sector. Fidelity International has also submitted an application, while several other asset managers, including Schroders, are expected to follow suit. U.S. fund giant Vanguard Group has announced it would close its Hong Kong and Japan operations, while shifting its Asian headquarters to Shanghai.

4.907859453713145," BlackRock conflicts managed 'extremely carefully,' Fed's Powell says NEW YORK (Reuters) - Any potential conflicts that may arise from having investment giant BlackRock Inc BLK.N buy corporate bonds and commercial mortgages on behalf of the Federal Reserve are being managed ""extremely carefully,"" Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday. BlackRock, which manages about $7 trillion in assets, was hired by the Fed in March to steer tens of billions of dollars in bond purchases as part of the U.S. central bank’s efforts to stabilize the bond market amid the economic turmoil caused by the coronavirus pandemic. BlackRock’s own ETFs accounted for a large share of corporate bond ETFs it bought on behalf of the Fed as part of the central bank’s relief program. BlackRock waived asset management fees on ETFs purchased on behalf of the Fed. “BlackRock is just our agent,” Powell said at his virtual news conference following the close of the Fed’s two-day meeting, in response to a reporter’s question on the handling of potential conflicts of interests. “We make the policy decisions in conjunction with our colleagues and they just execute our plans.” “I think their conflicts are managed extremely carefully in the contractual arrangement that we have with them,” Powell said. BlackRock, which in the past has said it is acting as a fiduciary to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and will execute the mandate at the sole discretion of the bank, had nothing to add to Powell’s comments, a BlackRock spokesman said. Powell’s public calendar shows he has had four phone conversations with BlackRock’s chief executive, Larry Fink, since March. Fink “generally checks in to find out whether we are OK with the quality of the service that BlackRock is providing,” Powell said. “He’s typically trying to make sure that we are getting good service from the company.” BlackRock’s fees for its role in assisting the Fed with its purchases of commercial mortgage-backed securities are capped at $8 million a year, according to details released in March."
7.455025270765127," Blackrock, Qatar's QIA interested in Atlantia's tollroad unit: sources MILAN (Reuters) - U.S. asset manager BlackRock BLK.N and Qatar's sovereign fund QIA are interested in investing in Atlantia's motorway unit ATL.MI along with Italian state lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP), two sources with knowledge of the matter said. The two could be part of a consortium made of Italian and foreign funds that is expected to buy around 20% in Atlantia’s Autostrade per l’Italia once it is demerged from its parent company, the source said. BlackRock and Qatar Investment Authority declined to comment on the issue. Autostrade is being sold off after the Italian government forced Atlantia to hand over control of the unit or face being stripped of its lucrative tollway concession in the wake of the deadly collapse of a motorway bridge in 2018 in which 43 people were killed. The consortium of investors and CDP could buy a controlling stake in Autostrade in an initial public offering to allay concerns over the price of the asset, a source close to the matter said on Sunday. The preliminary deal reached between Atlantia and the government will likely be ratified by Aug. 3, just before the inauguration of the new bridge in Genoa, the source said. Australian infrastructure fund Macquarie, U.S. investment firm Blackstone and the insurance arm of Poste Italiane PST.MI are among the other suitors for Autostrade, sources have told Reuters. Atlantia, which is controlled by the Benetton family, currently has an 88% stake in Autostrade, with Germany's Allianz ALVG.DE, France's EDF and China's Silk Road owning the rest."

BlackRock ended the quarter with $7.32 trillion in assets under management, up from $6.84 trillion a year earlier. The S&P 500 .SPX rose 20% in the second quarter after falling by that amount in the first three months of 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic slammed the economy. “We had more conversations with our clients in the last six months than we have probably had in aggregate in years,” Chief Executive Larry Fink said in an interview. “Clients are looking to BlackRock more than ever before.” BlackRock reported a 21% jump in quarterly profit as investors poured money into its fixed-income funds and cash management services. The New York-based company's net income rose to $1.21 billion, or $7.85 per share. Analysts had expected a profit of $6.99 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. (bit.ly/2ZEPkNv) The asset manager’s fixed-income funds took in $60.27 billion in new money. Its cash-management business attracted $24.2 billion in net inflows in the second quarter. “Improved investor sentiment led to robust asset gathering,” said Kyle Sanders, an analyst with St. Louis-based financial services firm Edward Jones. “We were most encouraged by the sharp rebound in asset flows, as we believe sustained flow growth above industry peers is a key driver for the stock,” he said. The asset manager’s technology business, a key area of growth for the firm, reported a 17% rise in revenue. BlackRock’s financial markets advisory unit, which manages the U.S. Federal Reserve’s bond-buying program, generated $17 million in revenue, down from $22 million for the same quarter a year ago. BlackRock shares, up about 13% for the year, were about 1% higher in early trading Friday. (This story corrects second quarter revenue from advisory business in penultimate par)"
12.524412948769111," Economic recovery further away than markets think: BlackRock CEO Fink NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. economy is going to take longer to recover from the hit from the coronavirus pandemic than the market expects, and more stimulus is critical, BlackRock Inc BLK.N Chief Executive Larry Fink said on Wednesday. “There is a belief that we will have some form of anti-viral that reduces the severity but let’s be clear, if we had this type of infection rate in March the markets would have been down even further,” Fink said. U.S. stocks fell sharply during the first three months of the year with the S&P 500 .SPX dipping 20%. Stocks have recovered since then and the index is down less than 1% for the year, even as coronavirus infections continue to shatter new records in the United States. “For one reason or another there is less fear about the disease with respect to its impact,” Fink said. Fink said additional stimulus is critical for the recovery. “Some jobs are going to have a harder time coming back. There is going to be a need for some kind of stimulus for job creation,” Fink said. There were 32 million people receiving unemployment checks under all programs in the last week of June, down 433,005 from the prior week, data on Thursday showed. Economists say unemployment remains uncomfortably high because of a second wave of layoffs, which could intensify as COVID-19 infections rise. The U.S. Senate will begin debate next week on a fifth coronavirus-response bill, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Monday, as he forecast tough negotiations with Democrats, who are seeking broader aid than Republicans.

The move comes after MasMovil's board backed a $3 billion bid by funds Providence, Cinven and KKR KKR.N to take the company private, kicking off Europe's first major deal of its kind since the coronavirus pandemic roiled global markets. Blackrock is the fifth biggest shareholder in MasMovil, having built up its holding after the bid was announced. It had held 5.7% last Friday. MasMovil's stock has held above the offer price of 22.50 euros ($25.70) since the bidders showed their hand on June 1, suggesting some investors expect a rival suit or improved bid for the firm, which has bought up low-cost brands including Lebara and Yoigo to stand up to global firms Telefonica TEF.MC Vodafone VOD.L and Orange ORAN.PA in the Spanish market. Some minor shareholders have demanded a higher price for MasMovil, of which bidder Providence is the second biggest shareholder, with just over 9%. Nevertheless, the bidders secured a $2 billion loan to fund the deal, and people close to the matter have told Reuters they expect to finalise it in the last three months of this year.

14.672839749723959," BlackRock cast tougher climate votes, environmentalists want more BOSTON (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc BLK.N released figures showing it took a tougher stance on climate matters in the springtime proxy season, though it drew criticism from environmentalists claiming the top asset manager failed to back up its recent emphasis on the area. BlackRock of New York said in a report on Tuesday that it voted against management at 53 companies worldwide, most of them energy companies, for “lack of progress” on climate concerns during the 2020 proxy season, and warned another 191 companies to take faster action. A BlackRock spokesman said via email its critical voting at 53 companies compared to critical votes it cast at six companies in 2019, indicating a tougher overall approach. With some $7 trillion under management BlackRock wields much influence on Corporate America’s boardrooms. Under pressure from clients and activists, BlackRock had said it would put a new focus on climate change concerns after supporting shareholder resolutions on the topic only about 10% of the time in the past. Tuesday’s numbers included votes that BlackRock cast for resolutions and against directors, breaking with management recommendations, and was not directly comparable to the 10% figure. Of the 53 companies, 37 were energy companies with a market capitalization of $408 billion, BlackRock said. In its report BlackRock cited votes like those it cast against directors at ExxonMobil Corp XOM.N this year, which were previously disclosed, for reasons including ""Exxon’s failure to have clear, long-term greenhouse gas reduction targets."" Ben Cushing, a representative of U.S. environmental group Sierra Club, said BlackRock should have voted critically more often rather than giving out warnings. “BlackRock took only baby steps forward by voting the right way on a fraction of the climate tests on the table, and claiming that stronger action is on the way,” Cushing said via email."

Most expect numbers from industry bellwether BlackRock and other asset managers to reflect the sharp stock market rebound. The S&P 500 rose 20% in the second quarter after falling as much in the first three months of 2020 as the coronavirus pandemic slammed the economy. Since the performance of asset managers tends to be tied to how markets fare, investors see a range of risks ahead, including further acceleration of U.S. coronavirus cases and potential market volatility around the Nov. 3 presidential election.

BlackRock is scheduled to report on July 17, with T. Rowe Price, WisdomTree Investments and Invesco among asset managers reporting in the following weeks. Analysts expect a strong recovery in the sector’s assets under management (AUM) in the second quarter, driven by rising financial markets and improving risk appetite. Higher levels of AUM mean more fees and stronger margins and earnings, analysts said. BlackRock’s assets fell to $6.47 trillion at the end of the first-quarter, from $7.43 trillion at the end of 2019. Improving fund flows are also likely to help second-quarter earnings for the group, analysts said. Fixed income flows reversed back into positive territory in April and stayed that way throughout the quarter while equity flows improved from March lows, according to Jefferies. Analysts at Morgan Stanley recently raised their estimate for second-quarter earnings-per-share for traditional asset managers by 19%. Most analysts expect BlackRock to show robust flows into its $2 trillion exchange-traded funds business, with strength in the fixed income and alternatives ETFs offsetting outflows from equities. Investors will also look for details on BlackRock’s role in the Federal Reserve’s debt-buying efforts as the central bank sought to stabilize a corporate bond market roiled by economic fallout of the pandemic. The firm’s own ETFs accounted for a large share of corporate bond ETFs it bought on behalf of the Fed as part of the central bank’s relief program.

8.44382034706749," Argentina formalizes debt offer with SEC; all eyes on BlackRock and co BUENOS AIRES, July 7 (Reuters) - Argentina has formalized its $65 billion debt restructuring offer with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and all eyes have turned to one key bloc of creditors, including names like BlackRock and Fidelity, which has so far stayed silent. The new “final” government offer, which improved payment terms and ceded ground on disputed legal terms, drew early support from some creditors on Monday, helping propel sovereign bonds up 4% on hopes a deal could be struck. However, the major Ad Hoc and Exchange bondholder groups, which combined hold around $21 billion of the total eligible debt and in theory could block any deal, have notably held off from supporting or rejecting the proposal. Argentina’s negotiations with creditors had stalled in June after edging close to an agreement, with the main issues being with the two groups, which slammed the talks as having failed and later criticized the government for a lack of engagement. A deal is key for Argentina to avoid a damaging legal standoff with creditors. The country defaulted for a ninth time in May and is headed for an estimated 12% economic contraction this year on the back of two straight years of recession. In the full prospectus, filed overnight with the SEC and in Argentina’s official gazette, the government added some details on the offer including on minimum participation thresholds. It said that the offer would go ahead only if it received support by an Aug. 4 deadline from holders of 66.6% of the total eligible bonds, or levels between 50%-60% if 2005 and 2016 bond indentures were taken independently. The offer, if successful, would be settled on Sept. 4."
3.9462643359870957," EU court rules against BlackRock tax break claim LONDON (Reuters) - BlackRock is not exempt from paying value added tax (VAT) on part of a service from an outside supplier to help manage its funds, a European Union court ruled on Thursday, dashing the fund sector’s hopes for cost savings. The world’s biggest asset manager had argued that between Jan. 1, 2010, and Jan. 30, 2013, it should not have to pay VAT on all the service given that it included services for special investment funds, which are exempt from the tax. Britain’s tax authority disagreed issued a recovery notice to cover the period. The First Chamber of the Court of Justice ruled on Thursday that a “single supply of management services, provided by a software platform belonging to a third-party supplier for the benefit of a fund management company, which manages both special investment funds and other funds, does not fall within the exemption provided for in that provision.” BlackRock said it respected the EU court’s decision. A source at the company said it had paid and continued to pay VAT in full. The court said that BlackRock in Britain receives services from a unit in the United States via a software platform called Aladdin that provides portfolio managers with market analysis to help make investment decisions. These services constitute a single supply, whichever funds are being managed, it said. Gert-Jan van Norden, a financial services partner at KPMG Netherlands, said the ruling would be a disappointment for the wider funds industry, which was hoping to copy BlackRock had the ruling gone the other way. “It does not seem a very reasonable outcome. If you bought these services from two different entities, it would not be a problem,” van Norden said."

-2.321364594272976," Fund giant BlackRock 'warming up' to European assets LONDON (Reuters) - BlackRock’s Investment Institute said on Tuesday it was “warming up” to European assets following what it called the eurozone’s “impressive” efforts to tackle the coronavirus. The research arm of the world’s biggest fund manager said two factors would support Europe’s economy and financial markets in the coming months. Success in restricting the spread of COVID-19 and signs that shopping and travel activity was rebounding meant: “we could see the pace of recovery in the second half outpacing other regions, including the United States”. It said the new 750-billion-euro European recovery plan was a “crucial turning point” too and will, for the first time, create a jointly issued European ‘safe’ asset of a meaningful size. “As a result we maintain our overweight in European peripheral government bonds and are considering an upgrade to European equities,” the BII’s top strategists said in a weekly report."
1.5509882352592175," Exclusive: BlackRock injects $18 billion into European firms during pandemic - source LONDON (Reuters) - The world's biggest asset manager BlackRock BLK.N has pumped about 16 billion euros ($18 billion) into 810 European companies since the end of January, more than half of them in distress due to the coronavirus pandemic, a source with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters. Companies across the world have looked to banks and asset managers to help provide emergency funding since the pandemic spurred most leading economies to lock down citizens in an effort to stop its spread, crippling many businesses. Since the end of January, BlackRock had provided around 3 billion euros in equity and 13 billion euros in credit to new and existing investee companies, the source said, with just over half of the firms raising money after a big hit from the virus. Of the capital deployed, around half went to companies in Britain, Europe’s biggest equity market. Among the companies to receive fresh capital were cinema owner Everyman Media EMANE.L, with BlackRock buying 3.4 million shares in April to become its second biggest investor, according to regulatory filings and Refinitiv data. Others included SSP Group SSPG.L, where BlackRock acquired 21 million shares in March to take its stake to 12.65%. The share prices of many companies had risen since the capital injection, to the benefit of BlackRock’s clients, as liquidity fears eased, the source said. “The positive impact of those investments in society and in local and national economies – in terms of supporting jobs, R&D, technology innovation and infrastructure rollout – is very significant,” said Rachel Lord, Head of EMEA at BlackRock. BlackRock, which managed around $6.5 trillion in assets at the end of March for both retail and institutional clients, is a major investor in most of Europe’s leading stock markets, and the region’s biggest money manager by assets under management. More than 100 firms had contacted BlackRock to sound out its willingness to take part in fundraisings, while more than 100 more had received pre-emptive calls from the asset manager to let them know the terms of potential support, the source said. As lockdowns are lifted and companies get a better sense of changes in consumer spending, a second wave of equity fundraisings could come in the fourth quarter, the source added. While companies often raise equity over several months, the emergency nature of many fundraisings meant many firms went to their biggest investors for help and completed deals quickly. In Britain, this was helped by a rule change in March that enabled firms to raise up to 20% of their share capital in quick-fire share sales. While investors including Schroders and Merian flagged their willingness to support such fundraisings, others criticised their dilutive impact on earnings per share."
3.303475621930352," Mexican president says spoke to BlackRock CEO over Argentina debt restructuring MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico’s president on Friday said he had spoken to BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink at the request of the Argentine government to lobby the asset management firm to accept Argentina’s offer during debt restructuring talks. Argentina and its biggest bondholders are at loggerheads over plans to restructure $65 billion in foreign debt, with some of the world’s biggest asset management companies negotiating with Buenos Aires. Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who has previously met with Fink, said Argentine President Alberto Fernandez had called him to ask him to speak to the BlackRock BLK.N boss and explain Argentina's restructuring proposal. “He knew I had a good relationship with Larry Fink,” Lopez Obrador told a news conference. Argentina had been asking for a multi-year halt on bond payments, plus a large reduction in coupon payments. Fernandez had an idea about how much of the debt Argentina could repay and told him the plan was “to pay 41% of the debt, a 59% reduction to reach an understanding”, Lopez Obrador added. The president, describing Fink as a “good person”, said he spoke to the BlackRock chief to inquire if he was aware of the proposals. Fink responded it was not solely down to him and that he would propose to the board a reduction of 50-55%, he added. BlackRock declined to comment. Holders of Argentine debt include asset managers Amundi, Ashmore, BlueBay, Fidelity, T. Rowe Price and several hedge funds. Lopez Obrador said he advised Fernandez that the usual recommendation was to reach a deal that would be convenient for all parties. The deadline set by the Argentine government to negotiate the debt restructuring is due to expire later on Friday, although this week Fernandez said the deadline for the negotiations would be extended by at least 10 days."

3.997025257789509," Breakingviews - BlackRock is becoming the new, old Goldman Sachs NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - It’s a force in myriad global markets. It’s the default source for governments needing advice on the biggest financial questions. Its sprawl means that sometimes it seems to be on both sides of certain dealings. That’s Goldman Sachs, before and during the financial crisis of 2008-2009. It also describes another company today: investment manager BlackRock. With some $7 trillion under management, Larry Fink’s mutual and exchange-traded fund specialist is by far the largest such group on the planet. Its funds typically own 5% or more of listed U.S. companies, often making the BlackRock complex the largest shareholder. The expertise it gleans from its global presence made it the go-to place for the Federal Reserve to get urgent help with parts of its multi-trillion-dollar coronavirus rescue package. Given this reach, Fink’s annual missives about corporate purpose and serving stakeholders beyond just shareholders are required reading for almost every chief executive. Moreover, institutional and corporate investment managers responsible for perhaps $30 trillion of assets – a figure 50% larger than U.S. GDP – use risk-management software called Aladdin that BlackRock developed, uses in-house, and sells to others, according to a Breakingviews estimate based on the last value disclosed by BlackRock and stock-market gains since then. Politicians have raised questions about the $80 billion firm’s many tentacles as recently as last month. Things like running mutual funds, for example, are regulated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and others. But the recent sale by lender PNC Financial Services of its 22% stake in the asset manager means there should be fewer limitations on BlackRock’s activities, and this also removed one potential source of more intrusive oversight. A newcomer to this story might think BlackRock, along with rival asset managers Vanguard and State Street, ought to be on watchdogs’ radar as critical to the world’s financial system – just as regulators have stamped the global systemically important financial institution, or G-SIFI, designation on Goldman, among a list of other global banks headed by JPMorgan. But they are not. There are valid reasons. The assets BlackRock manages belong to its clients, not to Fink’s company. As Douglas Elliott, then a fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution, noted in a 2014 paper, it’s important to distinguish what might be systemically risky about investors’ behavior from risks posed by asset managers themselves. Mutual funds and ETFs are, strictly, independent legal entities that are free to take their management contracts elsewhere. BlackRock doesn’t put its own money at risk – or that of depositors, as banks do – so there’s scant logic to bank-like capital-cushion requirements based, say, on a percentage of total assets under management. Prudential regulation of that kind matters fund-by-fund, but far less so, if at all, at the BlackRock corporate level. One or several individual funds could go belly-up with no financial impact on the company. The reputational damage might cost BlackRock’s shareholders – its bosses might even decide to voluntarily bail out funds to limit that damage – but other investors’ money would not be at risk. Thanks to these realities and a communication and lobbying effort by BlackRock and its peers, the Financial Stability Oversight Council – created by the post-crisis Dodd-Frank legislation and charged with looking at the issue – in 2014 shifted its focus toward risky products and activities, rather than companies like Fink’s. Even under that approach, worries about how ETFs – which have grown massively in popularity since 2009 – would perform in a crisis have so far proved mostly unfounded. Some differently structured exchange-traded products at other firms, like the United States Oil Fund, ran into trouble during the March coronavirus panic. But BlackRock ETFs, including those that track illiquid bonds, if anything helped provide price transparency. Creating a stress test more challenging than that would be difficult. Yet sheer size counts for something. Though BlackRock is most commonly a passive, index-tracking owner, some observers worry that holding big stakes in multiple firms that operate in the same sectors could lead to anti-competitive behavior. Also, if enough funds driven by similar corporate policies make similar bets and then all seek to unwind them at once, the market impact would by definition be larger if it’s BlackRock than a smaller competitor. Non-bank financial players are also on international watchdogs’ radar. Organizations like the Financial Stability Board worry about so-called shadow banking. But they will probably focus more on risks associated with opaque private debt funds or highly leveraged hedge funds than BlackRock’s products, especially given the ETF market recently navigated a testing experience. Still, Fink’s outfit can’t escape attention altogether. BlackRock can legitimately argue that the most significant potential systemic dangers are built into individual products. But the risk added by the company’s scale and integration in the global financial system is bigger than zero. Justified or not, BlackRock’s other business lines will also ensure it remains in the spotlight. One is the firm’s advisory business. As the dominant player in bond ETFs, BlackRock risks appearing to have a conflict of interest when advising the Fed, or other central banks, on massive bond-buying programs. In March, the U.S. central bank handed BlackRock’s financial markets advisory unit its bailout mandate without a competitive process. Questioned by Senator Martha McSally last month, Fed Chair Jay Powell said speed dictated the choice and the Fed would eventually rebid the contract. The advisory unit produces a tiny fraction of BlackRock’s revenue, but it punches above that weight in influence and prestige. It could easily become a flashpoint for political criticism that spills over into the company’s other business. Then there’s Aladdin. Users – sophisticated asset managers remarkably including Vanguard, BlackRock’s arch-rival – surely have alternative ways to monitor portfolio risk and perform other functions the software handles. But glitches with a widely relied-upon platform could still rattle markets. An operational misstep could harm the company’s reputation and raise the hackles of watchdogs, too. In her critique, McSally also took aim at BlackRock’s investments in China. Tracking global stock indexes that include some companies based there is not the same as actively investing in businesses in the People’s Republic. Still, after U.S. President Donald Trump in May lambasted the main federal retirement fund’s plan to start following an index that includes Chinese companies, the plan’s bosses backed off the idea. Such objections – and reactions – might spread, complicating BlackRock’s core fund-management business. Even Fink’s push for better environmental, social and governance accountability is controversial. For example, a group of Republican senators don’t want climate-related criteria that might apply to some BlackRock-managed funds to influence the Fed’s bond buying; rival Democrats, in contrast, do want the central bank to take climate risks into account. BlackRock’s incentives are very different from Goldman’s more than a decade ago. Its business model, in simplistic terms, is primarily about making money for others, not for its own account. However scrupulous and transparent BlackRock may try to be, though, suspicions will persist as it grows even larger. It’s easy to foresee calls for tighter regulation. BlackRock could become a political football, too, especially given Fink’s Democratic sympathies. Simply as a target, Goldman used to be the biggest in the financial world. That’s now BlackRock’s burden."
7.079535451719789," BlackRock focuses on China credit, oil and travel in Asia SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The world’s biggest asset manager, BlackRock Inc, called out oil stocks, domestic tourism and debt in China and India as investment opportunities in its Asia outlook on Wednesday. The manager of $6.5 trillion in assets expects it may be 2022 at the earliest before global growth returns to trend but said in a statement outlining its regional outlook that “Asia stands out” as a beneficiary when the recovery arrives. “We like China across the credit spectrum,” said Neeraj Seth, the fund manager’s head of Asian credit, since it is buttressed by strong government stimulus. He said state-owned businesses were favoured in the investment grade category and the real estate sector preferred in the high-yield category, while India’s quasi-sovereign debt and bonds funding renewable energy also presented opportunities. Oil majors, domestic travel and tourism stocks and carry-trade plays in Indonesia and India, as well as online businesses are chief among opportunities in equities, said Stephen Andrews, the fund’s co-head of global emerging market equities. “We are focusing on the post-coronavirus world,” he said. “We see oil prices rising from the current $30 plus range over our (1.5-2 year) investment horizon,” he added, and said price-to-book values in India and Indonesia are at 1-2 decade lows. On Wednesday, Asian stocks jumped to a three-month high and riskier currencies surged against the dollar as markets looked beyond near-term risks to a bright recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic.

15.993778324985309," U.S. charges ousted Hollywood executive with defrauding pandemic loan program, BlackRock fund NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. prosecutors have charged the recently ousted owner of a Hollywood movie distributor with defrauding a federal coronavirus emergency relief program and a BlackRock Inc investment fund, including to pay for a Beverly Hills mansion and other luxuries. Prosecutors said William Sadleir, 66, diverted much of the $1.7 million of loans he received on May 1 from the Paycheck Protection Program for personal expenses. He allegedly did this after falsely telling JPMorgan Chase & Co and the Small Business Administration the funds were meant for his former company Aviron Group, which had terminated him in December and where he has no current role. The PPP was meant “to help small businesses stay afloat during the financial crisis, and we will act swiftly against those who abuse the program for their own personal gain,” U.S. Attorney Nick Hanna in Los Angeles said in a statement. Sadleir was also accused of having previously induced the closed-end BlackRock Multi-Sector Income Trust Fund to invest $75 million in Aviron to support its films. Prosecutors said he then created a sham company to conceal his use of the money, and assumed the fake identity “Amanda Stevens” to communicate by email with the BlackRock fund about its investment. In a related civil case, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said Sadleir’s “lavish lifestyle” also included a $127,000 Tesla. A lawyer for Sadleir could not immediately be identified. A BlackRock spokesman declined to comment. Aviron’s films have included Halle Berry’s “Kidnap” and Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway’s “Serenity.” The BlackRock fund had $574 million of assets as of May 21, and normally invests most assets in debt and loans. It sued Sadleir for fraud in a New York state court in December. Sadleir faces up to 124 years in prison if convicted on all charges."

William Sadleir, 66, of Beverly Hills, California, was charged with two counts of wire fraud and one count of aggravated identity theft after inducing the closed-end BlackRock Multi-Sector Income Trust Fund to invest $75 million in his Aviron Group. Sadleir allegedly promised BlackRock its money would support his films, including through the purchase of $27 million in pre-paid media credits, or “up fronts,” with the GroupM affiliate of WPP Plc, the world’s largest advertising company. But prosecutors said Sadleir created the sham company GroupM Media Services LLC and a related bank account to make his activities look legitimate. They said he then posed as fake GroupM Media employee “Amanda Stevens” to communicate by email with the BlackRock fund about its investment. Authorities including the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which filed related civil charges, said Sadleir also spent embezzled money to remodel Aviron’s offices and buy a $127,000 Tesla, to help fund his “lavish lifestyle.” Sadleir’s lawyer in the criminal case could not immediately be identified. A lawyer who has represented Sadleir in civil litigation had no immediate comment. A BlackRock spokesman declined to comment. The BlackRock fund had $574 million of assets as of May 21. It normally invests at least 80% of assets in debt and loans. Sadleir was removed from Aviron’s helm after the BlackRock fund filed a fraud lawsuit against him and the company in a New York state court in Manhattan, court papers show. The wire fraud charges carry maximum 20 years prison terms. The criminal case is U.S. v. Sadleir, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 20-mag-05114.

PNC, BlackRock’s largest shareholder, will sell its common and preferred shares in a secondary offering and BlackRock will repurchase $1.1 billion in common shares, assuming the sale goes well. The Pittsburgh-based lender currently owns about 35 million shares in the asset manager, which is valued at roughly $17.3 billion, based on BlackRock’s last close on Monday, according to Reuters calculation. It also holds preferred shares. The divestment puts an end to longstanding questions about when PNC would sell its lucrative position that had over time become a burden amid tighter capital regulations. “We feel the time is now right,” PNC Chief Executive Officer William Demchak said in a statement. Edward Jones analyst Kyle Sanders said besides the regulatory pressure, PNC may want additional liquidity to deal with the economic downturn caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Since share prices are down 40% year-to-date, it may also be looking at acquiring another regional bank, he said. “The sale of BlackRock shares likely signals that PNC is looking to make a sizeable deal during a period of market disruption, which is consistent which their actions in the past,” Sanders said. During the 2008 financial crisis, PNC had acquired National City Corp in an opportunistic way. PNC acquired a stake in BlackRock in 1995 and spun it off after a few years while retaining a large stake. Shares of BlackRock slipped nearly 3% in after-market trading, as investors prepared for pressure from the offering, while those of PNC Financial rose 5%."
17.099930448865162," Republicans urge Trump to bar banks from shunning fossil fuel loans WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A group of Republican lawmakers from energy-producing states on Friday called on President Donald Trump to prevent banks from halting loans and investments with companies that produce oil and other fossil fuels while they have access to federal assistance programs during the COVID-19 pandemic. “Wall Street’s big banks ... should not be able to reap the benefits of participating in federally guaranteed loan programs laid out in the CARES Act, such as the Paycheck Protection Program or the trillion dollar Federal Reserve facility lending programs, while simultaneously targeting American energy companies and workers,” the lawmakers wrote in a letter to Trump. Democratic lawmakers like Senator Elizabeth Warren, who want an economic recovery featuring investments in conservation and alternative energy to fight climate change, have been calling on Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin to bar oil and gas companies from accessing loans through the Main Street facility. Many energy companies have been struggling to stave off bankruptcy due to a meltdown in global crude prices after governments around the world issued stay-at-home orders that obliterated demand for motor and jet fuel. For years, environmental activists have pressured banks and financial firms to drop support of fossil fuel companies. The Republican lawmakers, led by Senators Kevin Cramer of North Dakota and Dan Sullivan of Alaska, and Representatives Don Young of Alaska and Liz Cheney of Wyoming, accused some major U.S. financial institutions of halting fossil fuel investments to “placate the environmental fringe.” They specifically cited BlackRock Inc, the world’s largest asset manager, which has been given a central role in the COVID-19 corporate recovery as a fiduciary to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. BlackRock announced in January it was divesting from coal burned in power plants. Its global head of sustainable investing, Brian Deese, was a White House climate official under former President Barack Obama, a Democrat. “Considering BlackRock’s central role as a Federal Reserve fiduciary for the distribution of CARES Act credit facilities, its hostility towards the American energy sector is unacceptable and should be closely scrutinized,” the lawmakers wrote. The lawmakers urged Trump to use “every administrative and regulatory tool” to prevent those institutions from participating in federal lending programs while “discriminating” against investments in parts of the energy sector, but did not specify what measures could be taken. A spokesman for BlackRock said the company will execute its mandate as a fiduciary to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York “at the sole discretion of the bank, and in accordance with their detailed investment guidelines, in order to provide broad support to credit markets and achieve the government’s objective of supporting access to credit for U.S. employers and supporting the American economy.” Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette said in a recent interview that he and Mnuchin planned to work with U.S. regulators and the banking industry to ensure financial institutions do not discriminate against oil drillers when choosing whom to provide credit to."

Boss, an American, will remain in London and take over duties previously held by the company’s vice-chair Barbara Novick, who is stepping back from her day-to-day roles, according to a memo from the firm’s Chief Executive Larry Fink provided by a spokesman. Boss has been a non-employee member of a Bank of England risk committee and a director of two public companies. Britain’s central bank said on Thursday she is stepping down from her role there. Under Novick, BlackRock - with roughly $7 trillion in assets under management - largely took a behind-the-scenes approach in its dealings with the large companies in its portfolios. But under pressure from activists, this year Fink vowed to take a more aggressive approach especially on climate issues and other topics at companies where BlackRock is often among the top investors. For instance, just on Tuesday BlackRock disclosed early details of its votes against four directors at Boeing Co BA.N over safety lapses. BlackRock said Boss was not available to be interviewed. Fink said in his note that Boss will join the company on Monday, reporting to him as Senior Managing Director and Global Head of Investment Stewardship.

21.918207939444713," BlackRock says sustainability reports might slide during pandemic BOSTON (Reuters) - Top asset manager BlackRock Inc, which has vowed to put more focus on climate issues, said that companies might give a lower priority to sustainability reports as they struggle with the COVID-19 pandemic. In a stewardship document provided by a BlackRock BLK.N spokesman late on Tuesday, the firm suggested it would tolerate the change. BlackRock also took a neutral stance on the question of whether companies should continue to pay dividends or buy back shares, and said it expected companies to provide shareholders the chance for ""meaningful participation"" when they move annual meetings to cyberspace. The details marked some early specifics from the world’s largest asset manager about its expectations for companies dealing with the sudden economic shock stemming from the deadly respiratory virus. BlackRock earlier this year outlined tougher policies for the influential proxy votes it casts at springtime annual meetings, including a focus on having companies report more details about topics like their emissions and water pollution. In its new stewardship document, BlackRock said it encouraged companies to produce such reports, including Sanderson Farms Inc SAFM.O and streaming service Netflix Inc. NFLX.O But BlackRock also said it had been told by some companies that certain non-financial projects like sustainability reports had been “de-prioritized” due to COVID-19. “We recognize that in the near-term companies may need to reallocate resources to address immediate priorities in these uncertain times,” BlackRock’s report stated. BlackRock said it would “expect a return to companies focusing on material sustainability management and reporting in due course.” BlackRock representatives did not provide more details or make executives available for further comment on Tuesday. In the report, BlackRock said it voted against management recommendations 8% of the time among 2,269 company meetings worldwide in the first three months of 2020. In North America, it voted against management 13% of the time on “miscellaneous” shareholder proposals, the category that includes environmental matters, during the period. In addition to climate reporting, companies have faced calls to suspend their dividend payments or share buybacks in order to concentrate on paying workers during the pandemic. BlackRock took a neutral stance on the question, saying that absent regulation, “a company’s decision to pay a dividend or buy back shares should be determined by its management and board of directors.”"
24.347526618149015," BlackRock's assets under management shrink amid market turmoil NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc's BLK.N assets under management dipped sharply in the first quarter amid turmoil in global markets caused by concerns about the economic fallout of the coronavirus outbreak. BlackRock’s assets fell to $6.47 trillion from $7.43 trillion at the end of the fourth quarter. “We had vast de-risking from February 21 to the end of the quarter,” Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink said on a conference call with analysts. Worries about the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic hammered global financial markets in the first quarter and soured investor appetite for riskier assets like stocks. The benchmark S&P 500 index fell 20% during the period. The massive volatility in global markets has left asset managers dealing with the biggest challenge since the financial crisis of 2008. BlackRock’s net income fell to $806 million, or $5.15 per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, from $1.05 billion, or $6.61 per share, a year earlier. BlackRock pulled in $35 billion in new money during the quarter but a big part of that was due to risk-averse investors going to cash as markets became volatile. Its cash-management business reeled in over $52 billion in net inflows as clients sought to de-risk. “By asset class, index and active bond flows both missed our forecast substantially,” analysts at UBS wrote in a note. BlackRock’s fixed-income products, typically viewed as safe-havens, experienced outflows of $35 billion, sapping a recent source of strength for the asset manager. “Eroding investor sentiment was a headwind to asset gathering this quarter,” said Kyle Sanders, an analyst with St. Louis-based financial services firm Edward Jones. “Results were softer than usual, proving that even BlackRock isn’t immune to a market downturn,” Sanders said. A 34% growth in technology services revenue, to $274 million, was a bright spot, helping the firm grow revenue to $3.71 billion, up 11% from the comparable quarter last year. Speaking about a potential economic recovery, BlackRock’s Fink told CNBC that he does not see a rapid rebound. “Until we have adequate testing, rapid testing, it is very hard for me to see how we are going to reboot in the next 30 days,” Fink said. Many healthcare experts believe comprehensive testing as essential to the reopening of the economy, and chief executives from some of the nation’s biggest companies recently told President Donald Trump more testing was needed to guarantee safety. While Fink was confident that eventually new protocols to save lives and minimize the severity of the disease will be developed, leading to a more normalized environment, he said it may not be until August. BlackRock is a key partner in the U.S. government’s effort to support the U.S. economy. BlackRock was recently hired by the New York Fed to manage purchases of commercial mortgage-backed securities and to oversee certain liquidity facilities. The firm will also oversee the secondary market corporate credit facility, which will purchase corporate bonds and exchange-traded funds. The asset manager’s shares, down about 10% for the year, rose 1.9% on Thursday."

17.327597217253793," BlackRock CEO Larry Fink's pay fell 8.4% in 2019: filing NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc BLK.N, the world's largest asset manager, cut total compensation for Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink by 8.4% in 2019, a second straight year of decline, according to a filing on Thursday. Fink was awarded $24.3 million in compensation last year, compared with $26.5 million in 2018, based on a calculation of his pay in line with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission guidelines. Going by a set of calculations BlackRock prefers, Fink’s total compensation for the year rose 5% to $25.25 million. The figures differ because BlackRock reports some incentive pay in a different year. Fink is often quoted for his views on the markets and corporate governance and has been listed among the world’s best CEOs by the newspaper Barron’s. BlackRock's stock rose 28% in price during 2019, its best performance since 2017, as global financial markets rebounded from a sharp selloff at the end of 2018. That compares with a 23.5% rise for a Thomson Reuters index that includes more than a dozen of BlackRock's industry rivals in the United States .TRXFLDUSPINVM. The shares, which hit a near four-year low of $323.98 in late March 2020 amid a broad-market selloff, have recovered some ground to trade down about 7% for 2020. Fink’s pay is among the highest in investment management globally as well as among U.S. financial firms, according to Thomson Reuters data. In the past the company’s pay to executive officers has drawn criticism from proxy adviser Glass Lewis & Co LLC. The company’s president, Rob Kapito, was paid $19.3 million in 2019, a decrease of 7.6% from the prior year, according to the calculations based on regulatory guidelines. Kapito and Fink were among BlackRock’s founders in 1988."

The companies did not disclose the financial terms of the deal. BlackRock’s Aladdin system is used by asset managers to help manage the risk in their portfolios and assist them in trading, data management and other operations.

33.79684213110889," World economy could contract by 11% in H1 2020: BlackRock managing director DUBAI (Reuters) - BlackRock's BLK.N Managing Director Amer Bisat said on Wednesday that the world economy could contract by 11% in the first half of 2020 and lose $6 trillion in economic output due to the coronavirus pandemic. “To put this in context, this will be worse than the contraction that we saw in 2008, it will be worse than the one that people estimate happened during the (1918) Spanish flu,” Bisat said. “It won’t be as bad as the (1930s) Global Depression, which is a significantly worse contraction, but it will certainly be the second-worst economic shock that we’ve seen globally.” BlackRock is the world’s largest asset manager. Conservatively, 5 million jobs could be lost in January-June, Bisat told a virtual panel discussion moderated by the Carnegie Middle East Center. The picture looks even worse when under-employment, reduced hours and reduced wages are taken into account, he added. Asked if the policy reaction so far has been commensurate to the shock, Bisat said: “Politically, the answer is categorically no.” But he praised the economic measures taken by governments and central banks. “Just the announced amount of fiscal stimulus that has been thrown globally at the problem between February and March ... is $5 trillion worth of fiscal inputs that will be thrown over the global economy for the next probably six months or so. “To that you add 65 cases of interest rate cuts, you have 20-odd countries that have already announced some form of quantitative easing. How do you translate all this into stimulus?” Bisat said. “It’s complicated, but the reality is this is unprecedented.” Bisat likened the economic shock from the pandemic to a natural disaster, which he said usually “leads to a strong recovery afterwards”. The recovery from the coronavirus’s impact “is not likely to be as aggressive”, however, due to uncertainty around when the shock will end, the possibility the virus will re-emerge, and its global nature. But after the strong policy measures taken and pent-up demand, “there’s no question in my mind that the recovery will be very, very sharp afterwards.” “It will look like a V. The question to me is: will the size of the V be so powerful that it will offset the lost output from the downside? I think the answer is no,” Bisat said, adding he estimated “we will lose 2 to 3 percentage points of global GDP that we will never see again”. Speaking about Lebanon, where a financial crisis exacerbated by months of political instability has brought much of the economy to a halt, Bisat said the coronavirus pandemic could push a forecast contraction to “higher double digits”. He said the country was in urgent need of external financing, adding: “Any international support right now would desperately need the umbrella of the IMF.”"

33.79684213110889," BlackRock, Neuberger Berman apply for China fund business as Beijing steps up deregulation SHANGHAI (Reuters) - BlackRock BLK.N and Neuberger Berman on Wednesday became the first global asset managers to submit applications to set upmutual fund units in China as Beijing pushes ahead with financial sector deregulation despite the coronavirus pandemic. The China Securities Regulatory Commission said it has accepted applications from the two money managers as the country scraps foreign ownership caps in the sector on April 1 as planned. “China is making as clear as China can make clear in its intention that this is a market that is open to foreign participation,” said Peter Alexander, founder and managing director of fund consultancy Z-Ben Advisors. “China is trying to demonstrate in this period of heightened uncertainty in Europe and the United States that they were able to work through very successfully the COVID-19 virus, and that very quickly they were able to get back to business as usual.” The announcement came a day after the city government of Beijing said it had launched an outbound investment scheme that attracted applicants including Oaktree, Bridgewater and Amundi. It also follows China's approval to Goldman Sachs GS.N and Morgan Stanley MS.N to take majority stakes in their China securities ventures. A mutual fund unit would expand the China footprint of BlackRock, which already owns a private fund management unit and a joint venture mutual fund house in China. “We are pleased to have taken this next step in pursuing our onshore presence in China, a market where we expect to see rapid growth in financial assets,” Geraldine Buckingham, BlackRock’s Chair of Asia Pacific, said in a statement. “We firmly believe that China is one of the biggest opportunities for BlackRock over the long term.” The applications were expected, as China agreed to fully open its mutual fund and brokerage sectors on April 1 as part of the interim Sino-U.S. trade deal signed in January. Other global asset managers including Fidelity International and Schroders also plan to submit applications once rules allow, the government of Shanghai said last month. Fidelity said China is a critical market for the fund manager and it would apply for mutual fund management license when ready. Schroders was not immediately available for comment."
20.28550514425357," BlackRock's Fink sees global economy recovering steadily from coronavirus hit NEW YORK (Reuters) - The global economy, which has been battered by the coronavirus outbreak, will recover steadily, in part due to the absence of obstacles usually found in a recovery from a typical financial crises, Larry Fink, chief executive at BlackRock Inc BLK.N, said in his annual letter to shareholders on Monday. “Central banks are moving quickly to address problems in credit markets, and governments are now acting aggressively to enact fiscal stimulus,” he said. These actions are likely to be more effective and work more quickly since they are not fighting against the same structural challenges as they were a decade ago, Fink said. A raft of fiscal and monetary measures across the globe have helped steady investors’ nerves in recent days, even as hopes remain that central banks and governments stand ready to provide even more support if needed. Fink, who is also chairman at BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, said the stressed conditions in markets had highlighted the role of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in providing liquidity and transparency, especially fixed-income ETFs. “As markets experienced significant stress related to concerns over the global spread of the virus, ETFs traded in record volumes, including $1.4 trillion in the U.S. alone, or 37% of all U.S. equity activity compared to a 27% average for 2019,” Fink said."
23.962427375357038," Fed sets fee structure for BlackRock's role in mortgage bond purchases NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc will earn less than $8 million a year in fees for its role assisting the Federal Reserve with its purchases of commercial mortgage-backed securities, one of the new programs the central bank is rolling out to backstop an economy under threat from the coronavirus outbreak, according to details of the arrangement released on Friday. Under BlackRock’s contract with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York for the bond purchases, it will earn a quarterly fee equal to an annualized 2 basis points on the first $20 billion of assets under management and then 1.25 basis points on the next $30 billion of assets. It will earn no fee for amounts above $50 billion under management. That amounts to a maximum annual fee of $7.75 million paid to BlackRock for the bond purchases. The firm managed more than $7 trillion at the end of last year and generated more than $14.5 billion in revenue. The New York Fed said earlier this week that it hired BlackRock to manage purchases of commercial mortgage-backed securities and to oversee certain liquidity facilities. “BlackRock was selected on a short-term basis to serve as an investment manager after considering their expertise in trading and analyzing agency CMBS in the secondary market, and robust operational and technological capabilities,” the Fed said.

37.181531519007876," U.S. Fed hires BlackRock to help execute mortgage-backed securities purchases WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve has hired asset management giant BlackRock to help it execute the purchase of commercial mortgage-backed securities announced this week as part of the central bank’s aggressive efforts to shore up the U.S. economy. Over the past week, the central bank has released a volley of measures to boost liquidity in the financial markets and get cash into the hands of small businesses and consumers amid growing worries the coronavirus outbreak would wreak economic havoc across the country. As part of that program, the Fed has committed to purchasing billion of dollars of commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS) secured primarily by multifamily home mortgages guaranteed by housing giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The New York Fed said in a statement on Tuesday it had retained BlackRock Financial Markets Advisory to purchase the assets on the Fed’s behalf from primary dealers in the market. “BlackRock was selected on a short-term basis to serve as an investment manager after considering their expertise in trading and analyzing agency CMBS in the secondary market, and robust operational and technological capabilities,” the Fed said. BlackRock said it would release more details on the terms and conditions of the purchasing program in due course and would not discuss any purchases with dealers until then. Earlier on Tuesday, the Fed also told large banks it still expected them to submit the capital plans for the central bank’s annual stress tests by the original April 6 deadline, In said those plans will be used to “monitor how firms are managing their capital in the current environment.” At the same time, the Fed said it will give banks more time to address non-critical examiner issues and will temporarily reduce examination activities at banks. Instead, the Fed is currently focused on bank outreach to make sure firms can manage the challenge and risks brought on by the pandemic. “The Board recognizes that the current situation is significantly affecting areas of the country in different ways and will work with financial institutions to understand the specific issues they are facing,” the Fed said in a separate statement. Its supervisory adjustments mark the latest move by U.S. bank regulators to reassure banks that the Fed wants them to continue lending through the economic downturn, and that it will not pursue them for regulatory foot-fault. Earlier in March, European Union banking regulators delayed this year’s stress test and eased some capital rules to avoid lenders turning off the taps over the coronavirus threat. The Fed is currently scheduled to assess the capital plans for 34 large banks, with results published on June 30."

70.53038448104728," BlackRock no longer in the race for ADNOC's gas pipeline assets - sources MILAN/DUBAI, March 23 (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc has dropped out of the race to become an investor in Abu Dhabi National Oil Co’s (ADNOC) natural gas pipeline assets, two sources familiar with the matter said. That leaves Italian infrastructure firm Snam and Global Infrastructure Partners among at least six remaining bidders, they said. BlackRock, along with buyout firm KKR & Co, last year bought a 40% stake in ADNOC Oil Pipelines for $4 billion, and was also looking at a deal involving ADNOC’s gas pipeline infrastructure, the sources said. However, it has now decided not to bid for the assets. “BlackRock is not there anymore,” said one of the sources with knowledge of the matter, adding the timing is not right for the world’s largest fund manager given the global market turmoil linked to the coronavirus outbreak. ADNOC, BlackRock and Snam declined to comment. Global Infrastructure Partners did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment. The sources declined to be identified because the information was not public. ADNOC hired Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Mizuho last year to arrange the lease of its natural gas pipeline assets, Reuters reported, citing sources familiar with the matter, as it sought new partnerships in an era of lower oil prices. ADNOC, which manages almost all of the proven oil reserves in the United Arab Emirates, has embarked on a major shake-up over the past few years to cut costs, boost efficiency and monetise its assets. Snam is looking at ADNOC natural gas pipelines alongside other infrastructure funds such as Global Infrastructure Partners, the two sources said. There are six to seven bidders in the race, one of the sources said. “It’s a big price tag, so there could be a big alliance among the various subjects interested,” one of the sources said. Two other sources said it would makes sense for ADNOC to delay the bidding process given the size of the transaction and global market uncertainty.

40.69744564086123," BlackRock stands by climate priorities, sees tougher shareholder votes BOSTON/LONDON (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc executives who set the asset manager’s influential proxy votes on Tuesday outlined tougher priorities tied to climate change and executive pay for the upcoming corporate annual meeting season taking place amid the coronavirus pandemic. The comments fleshed out details about how the $7 trillion asset manager would cast its shareholder votes at a time of economic uncertainty. BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink laid out a more forceful approach in January after criticism from investors. Michelle Edkins, BlackRock's BLK.N global head of investment stewardship, said in an interview on Tuesday that the pandemic is consuming corporate attention but indicated that BlackRock will not cut company directors slack as it decides whether to back their re-election. BlackRock will continue to judge whether boards have made progress against goals BlackRock has touted for several years such as those tied to climate issues, Edkins said. This year, she said, “We’re being much more direct.” Absent progress the company expects it will vote against more directors, she said. In previous years it has supported directors about 97% of the time at Russell 3000 companies, according to Proxy Insight. Edkins also said the pandemic could help sort out which companies have kept a long-term focus and have strong human capital management and business continuity plans. “The concept of long-term sustainability would suggest that companies that come through this crisis and do well would be exactly the kinds of companies you would look to as role models,” she said. BlackRock’s comments come as investors weigh what impact the coronavirus will have on efforts to slow climate change. Among other things, BlackRock this year will look for executive pay to correlate with long-term performance metrics such as companies’ total shareholder returns over three or five years, according to a fact sheet provided by the company. A Reuters analysis last year found a pattern of deference to managers by BlackRock and other top index fund managers, even at poor-performing companies as measured by three-year returns through the end of 2018. BlackRock also will ask companies to give details recommended by the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures and the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, and threatened to vote against non-executive directors in cases where there are not adequate disclosures. BlackRock said it will explain more specific votes, such as why it opposed executive pay at chipmaker Qualcomm Inc QCOM.O. BlackRock published seven such explanations in 2017, but just two the next year and one in 2019. Now, said BlackRock Vice Chairman Barbara Novick, “We’re trying to enhance the quantity and quality of communications.” In another example cited by a BlackRock spokesman on Wednesday, the company said in a note on its website that it voted against the chair of the audit committee of energy provider National Fuel Gas Co. NFG.N at its annual meeting on March 11 for lagging reporting on climate matters. Because the Williamsville, New York-based company faces risks including the need to set emission reduction targets and potentially decreased demand for its products, “we would have expected the company to be farther along in its reporting,” BlackRock’s note said. National Fuel spokesperson Karen Merkel said via email that the company appreciates shareholder feedback and it has enhanced sustainability disclosures. “National Fuel is focused on this important topic, with an eye toward continued improvement in the years ahead,” Merkel said."

22.680022491028986," 'Thanks Larry!' Green accounting project says BlackRock plug gave it a boost BOSTON (Reuters) - The Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, which hopes to standardize how companies report their environmental and social impact, said it has received a flood of new interest since investment giant BlackRock Inc BLK.N touted it an open letter to CEOs this year. The San Francisco-based nonprofit, which has received funding from liberal billionaires Michael Bloomberg and Tom Steyer – both of whom recently withdrew as contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination - said its website drew 1,092 new users per day in February, more than double the daily rate last year, with many of the visits from accountants and lawyers who oversee corporate filings. SASB CEO Janine Guillot said the group is now working to translate the new traffic into more data reporting. SASB counts 139 companies worldwide that report data in accordance with its guidelines. Guillot said she expects that could rise to as many as 300 by next year. “It is surprising how much a little letter from Larry Fink can generate,” said Guillot, referring to BlackRock’s CEO. Fink’s annual missive to corporate CEOs in mid-January asked that all companies in which BlackRock invests by year-end “publish a disclosure in line with industry-specific SASB guidelines,” or something similar, arguing in favor of SASB’s “clear set of standards.” State Street Corp, STT.N another large asset manager, also plugged SASB for promoting material disclosures in a recent open letter. SASB is one of several organizations – another is the Global Reporting Initiative - seeking to cut through a fog of uncertainty on how to measure companies’ progress on sustainability matters, at a time of mounting concern among investors over climate change and other issues. A lack of widely adopted reporting standards on sustainability metrics up to now has yielded alarming results for ratings firms seeking to rank companies on their performances, complicating the task for investors trying to build a truly green portfolio. [L3N26L3XH] In a study published last year, for example, MIT Researcher Roberto Rigobon found the scores that companies received from five top environmental, social and governance (ESG) ratings firms on greenhouse gas emissions had an average correlation of 0.13 - remarkably low considering the 0.9 level of major credit ratings services. “This is disturbing,” Rigobon said. “We need to be able to figure out as a society who is behaving badly and who is not.” Finding a set of uniform reporting standards for sustainability could solve the problem in the same way as financial accounting standards have made it easier for investors to assess a company’s financial health, according to Robert Fernandez, vice president at Breckinridge Capital Advisors and a member of SASB’s investor advisory group. “Maybe we wouldn’t have to rely on the ESG raters as much if there were more data and we could do more of the analysis ourselves,” he said. SASB rival GRI asks for a wider range of details in its sustainability reporting guidelines than SASB’s industry-specific requests. GRI is used by about 4,000 companies, according to research firm Corporate Register, though the figure has grown little in recent years. GRI CEO Tim Mohin said he worries investors and companies are going to lean toward SASB’s narrower reporting guidelines, instead of GRI’s more thorough ones. If SASB became dominant, he said, “It could become a massive rollback of ESG disclosure.” BlackRock did not make executives available to discuss why they favored SASB. BlackRock has a representative on the board that sets SASB standards, and executives from BlackRock and from State Street serve on SASB’s investor advisory group. Some companies report against both SASB and GRI standards, or plan to do so soon, including Vornado Realty Trust VNO.N, JetBlue Airways Corp JBLU.O and Duke Energy DUK.N. Duke executives said they hope the standards eventually converge. “We just want to have consistency, that’s the main goal,” said Duke CFO Steve Young. For other companies, SASB's simplicity makes it a favorite. Sanderson Farms Inc SAFM.O of Laurel, Mississippi, said last month it will adopt SASB guidelines, even after shareholders rejected a resolution seeking partial SASB reporting. Chief Financial Officer Mike Cockrell said the company made the decision after BlackRock and other investors suggested the step. He said he also hopes the move will forestall shareholder requests for other, more detailed disclosures including from the GRI. “I could have a staff of 30 people working 40 hours a week for 52 weeks and still not be able to complete some of these reports,” he said. Andrew Behar, CEO of environmental resolution sponsor As You Sow, said he credits BlackRock and State Street for boosting SASB, even if ideally companies would also provide a GRI report. For now, he said, “We got what we wanted.”"

She will also assist in conducting internal and external searches to find her successor. “Much of the post-financial crisis policy work that Barbara led is largely implemented, and she has greatly enhanced our stewardship practices, including our commitment to transparency”, Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink said in the memo. Less than half of BlackRock’s original slate of eight co-founders will remain at the firm once Novick leaves. She has been vocal on issues, including CEOs serving on other companies’ boards. “It sounds fine to sit on multiple boards, but what happens when something goes wrong at a company?” she said in an interview last year.

3.7628254743736473," Presidential hopeful Warren latest to press BlackRock on climate SAN FRANCISCO/BOSTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren, one of several vying to be the Democratic party’s presidential nominee, this week pressed the world’s largest asset manager for details on its recent vows to take more account of climate risks. The five-page letter, also signed by senators Sheldon Whitehouse, Cory Booker and Chris Van Hollen, is the latest outreach BlackRock Inc BLK.N has received over sustainability matters and reflects the growing interest, at least among some Democrats, in making climate a business issue for financial firms. Among other things, the Warren-led group asked BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink whether he supports legislation that would require companies to disclose risks such as those tied to rising sea levels, and for details on how it plans to make use of sustainable funds. Currently, “investors lack access to basic information about the potential risk of the climate crisis on American companies,” the letter states. A BlackRock representative said the company is reviewing the letter. Climate change has become a central issue in the contest to become the Democrats’ pick to take on President Donald Trump in the November presidential election. Candidates including Warren, front-runner Bernie Sanders and others have called for steps including an end to fracking, cuts to carbon emissions and shoring up infrastructure against more frequent massive storms. Trump has called climate change a hoax, although he said at a conference at the Swiss resort of Davos last month that the U.S. would join the one trillion trees sustainability initiative. Financial firms have faced growing pressure on climate matters including top bank JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, which on Tuesday raised its clean-energy lending commitments. U.S. financial regulators so far have declined to embrace calls for standard metrics to evaluate corporate exposure to climate change and other sustainability trends. One proposed solution is to have companies report against metrics offered by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board, a nonprofit organization whose backers including another Democratic presidential candidate, billionaire Michael Bloomberg. Last month Fink forecast a “fundamental reshaping of finance” due to climate change risks, and urged companies to make disclosures in line with those suggested by SASB and the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. Activists have praised Fink’s intentions but said they are waiting to see how the company acts, such as how it votes on climate-related issues at the springtime proxy season."

-11.723621198713813," BlackRock bolsters European management as part of regional expansion: memo LONDON (Reuters) - BlackRock BLK.N, the world's biggest asset manager, has appointed two executives to oversee its operations in continental Europe as part of efforts to expand in the region, a memo to staff on Wednesday seen by Reuters showed. BlackRock has accelerated its investment in the region as a strategic priority over the last two years and now runs more than $1 trillion there, “making us the largest independent asset manager on the Continent,” Rachel Lord, its head of Europe, Middle East and Africa, said in the memo. With “an ambitious strategy for growth”, Lord said BlackRock needed dedicated leadership in continental Europe and so had appointed Stephane Lapiquonne and Christian Hyldahl to jointly lead the company’s efforts. The two would work with the firm’s country managers and regional leadership to develop a continental European platform for BlackRock, she said. “The objective is to help individual countries deliver BlackRock’s scale and collective voice to our people, clients and wider stakeholders,” Lord said. Paris-based Lapiquonne joined the firm in 2010 to build the company’s Financial Markets Advisory capability in EMEA. Copenhagen-based Hyldahl joined last year and was previously chief executive of Danish pension fund ATP and Nordea Asset Management. Both will report to Lord and will represent the region on the company’s European Executive Committee. Hyldahl and Lapiquonne will remain country managers for the Nordics and for France, Belgium and Luxembourg, respectively. BlackRock has more than 2,000 employees in more than 15 offices across continental Europe, compared with more than 3,000 in Britain, which it has previously said will remain its European base of operations after Brexit. Britain’s exit from the European Union has prompted many large asset managers with continental European clients to set up or expand their presence there, to ensure a continued right to trade. As part of its expansion in the region, BlackRock last year bought French data firm eFront for $1.3 billion. It also announced plans to build up its so-called “alternatives” investing team in Paris and moved some staff to the Netherlands. BlackRock has ridden a wave of increased demand from clients to use cheaper index-tracking funds, a trend that is expected to continue and which has also benefitted Amundi AMUN.PA, the region's largest asset manager by total assets and which is majority owned by French bank Credit Agricole CAGR.PA."

-12.187856231450075," On shareholder vote reforms, BlackRock sits on the fence NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc BLK.N declined to back or reject a regulatory proposal to reform the shareholder resolution process in a long-awaited letter distributed on Thursday, seeking instead a middle ground on a hotly contested, politicized issue. The letter provided by a spokesman for the world’s largest asset manager was just one of thousands of comments filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These were due Monday, but so many were filed they caused a backlog on the agency’s website and some were still appearing on Thursday. Shareholder activists said their supporters filed a record number of critical comments against changes they worry would make it harder to bring attention to environmental, social and governance issues. Meanwhile, corporations supportive of the rule changes want them in order to streamline annual meetings. Both sides had hoped that BlackRock -- with $7.4 trillion under management -- would support them before the SEC finalizes the rule in or around March, especially after BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink said last month the company would focus more on climate issues. But the company disappointed both sides. “I think it would have been more to the point for BlackRock’s letter to have said simply: Dear SEC: We don’t have a clear position,” Jon Hale, global head of sustainable investing research for Morningstar, who has previously criticized the rules, said in an email. BlackRock Vice Chairman Barbara Novick did not directly address controversial ideas the SEC proposed in a November draft, such as raising the current ownership threshold of $2,000 worth of stock required to file some resolutions. “Shareholder proposals can be a valuable part of an investment stewardship process, however, it should be acknowledged that the costs of these proposals are borne by all shareholders,” Novick wrote. A BlackRock spokesman did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday. Among other big passive fund managers, Vanguard Group, in its own comment supported a longer holding period for investors looking to file proposals. A State Street Corp STT.N executive said in an interview last week the firm did not have a view on the matter. Some smaller active managers have criticized the reforms. Richard Fields, a King & Spalding LLP attorney, said that in avoiding specifics in its SEC comments, “BlackRock has chosen to stay squarely on the fence.” While BlackRock’s clients may have a wide range of views on the proposals, “one might have assumed that Fink’s January letter would herald a more assertive posture,” he added. Separately, BlackRock has begun to offer more details about its proxy votes, as it had pledged at the time of Fink’s letter. Among other things new disclosures on BlackRock's site showed it backed management at American Outdoor Brands Corp AOBC.O in September on several matters ""upon engagement"" with the gunmaker. BlackRock also opposed executive pay at cosmetics company Coty Inc COTY.N in November as ""not aligned with performance and peers."" And in September BlackRock opposed a shareholder measure on supply chain pesticides at food giant Kraft Heinz Co KHC.O as matters that ""should be left to the board"" absent demonstrable harm to investors. A Kraft Heinz spokesman declined to comment. Coty representatives did not immediately comment. A spokeswoman for American Outdoor, Elizabeth Sharp, did not provide details of its talks with BlackRock but said investor feedback helps it “better understand our stockholders’ priorities and perspectives.”"

-9.725162825348374," BlackRock, partners eye initial $500 million for climate fund LONDON (Reuters) - A BlackRock-backed BLK.N group aims to raise an initial $500 million for a private equity fund that will invest in climate change-linked infrastructure upgrades in emerging markets. The group will provide the first $100 million of funding for the Climate Finance Partnership (CFP), which was set up in 2018 along with France, Germany and the Hewlett and Grantham charitable foundations, it said in a statement on Wednesday. The funding will go toward a first-loss tranche that will absorb any initial losses, a safety net for other institutional investors that BlackRock expects to help it raise at least another $400 million. The CFP fund will be invested in renewable energy, energy efficiency, energy storage solutions and ultra-low and electric transport. At least a quarter of the investments would be made in Africa, with the rest in selected countries in Southeast Asia and Latin America, BlackRock said. The venture is part of a wide-ranging overhaul of the way BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, is responding to the issue of climate change, as part of a broader commitment to environmental, social and governance-related investing. Climate has also been at the forefront of this year’s annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, at which news of the planned initial fund-raising was announced. Finding novel ways to encourage accelerated investments has been a theme at Davos, and on Wednesday a separate $500 million United Nations-backed initiative also announced a plan to help achieve the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, ‘SDG500’. The money raised will target businesses in the agriculture, finance, energy, education and healthcare sectors across many of the regions worst-hit by climate change. As with the CFP fund, the coalition of private and public sector organizations will also provide a first-loss layer for those investing in the project, which will provide exposure to six funds managed by asset manager Bamboo Partners. In a recent annual letter to the thousands of companies in which BlackRock holds stakes, Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink said the need to act on climate was “particularly urgent” given many cities were not built to withstand “the new climate reality”. France and Germany will both invest $30 million of the initial funding, while the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and the Jeremy and Hannelore Grantham Environmental Trust have pledged $10 million and $7.5 million, respectively.

BlackRock will provide the first $100 million of funding for the Climate Finance Partnership (CFP), which was set up in 2018 by France, Germany and the Hewlett and Grantham charitable foundations, the company said in a statement on Wednesday. The BlackRock funding will go toward a first-loss tranche that will absorb any initial losses, a safety net for other institutional investors which BlackRock expects to help it raise at least another $400 million. The CFP fund will be invested in renewable energy, energy efficiency, energy storage solutions and ultra-low and electric transport. At least a quarter of the investments would be made in Africa, with the rest in selected countries in South East Asia and Latin America, BlackRock said. The venture is part of a wide-ranging overhaul of the way BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, is responding to the issue of climate change, as part of a broader commitment to environmental, social and governance-related investing. In a recent annual letter to the thousands of companies in which BlackRock holds stakes, Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink said the need to act was “particularly urgent” given many cities were not built to withstand “the new climate reality”. Climate has also been at the forefront of this year’s annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, at which news of the planned initial fund-raising is set to be announced. “We believe creative collaboration is essential to mobilizing investment into climate infrastructure in emerging markets at scale, providing our clients with further opportunity to invest in the global low-carbon transition,” Brian Deese, Global Head of Sustainable Investing at BlackRock, said in the statement. France and Germany will both invest $30 million of the initial funding, while the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation and the Jeremy and Hannelore Grantham Environmental Trust have pledged $10 million and $7.5 million, respectively. The CFP members have pledged to help raise the additional seed capital for the fund. BlackRock will invest an as yet determined amount in addition to the funding for the first-loss tranche. “Emerging market equities are substantially cheaper than those in developed economies and they offer the best choice for growth in an otherwise slow-growth world,” said Jeremy Grantham, Trustee of the Jeremy and Hannelore Grantham Environmental Trust.

-15.808910812561278," BlackRock profit beats estimates as assets top $7 trillion NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc BLK.N, the world's largest asset manager, beat analysts' estimates for quarterly profit on Wednesday, helped by strong flows into its exchange-traded fund business that boosted overall assets under management to a record $7.43 trillion. A rally in global equity markets and strong inflows across business segments helped the company lure $128.84 billion in new money during the fourth quarter through Dec. 31. “I think it’s quite evident from our flows in the fourth quarter that we are winning more of our clients’ share of wallet,” Chief Executive Larry Fink said in an interview with Reuters. Even as the stock market enjoyed a sharp rally recently, many of BlackRock’s clients were under-invested in equities and remained heavily oriented towards fixed-income securities, Fink said. However, fears of a global slowdown have moderated through 2019 and investors have started to take on risk, he added. BlackRock’s iShares-branded ETFs took in $75.20 billion of new money, up from $41.50 billion in the prior quarter, taking the net inflow for the year to $183 billion. Those flows helped lift total assets to $7.43 trillion. “A lot of times, if a company is big, the law of big numbers makes it hard to grow, we are not seeing that with BlackRock,” said Kyle Sanders, an analyst with St. Louis-based financial services firm Edward Jones. “The size is actually allowing them to continue to be more aggressive and push into new products and take market share,” said Sanders, who maintained a ‘buy’ rating on the company. With its growing heft, BlackRock has drawn increased scrutiny of its fossil fuel investments. On Tuesday, Fink warned company boards to step up efforts to tackle climate change, a significant shift by the world’s top asset manager. In his annual letter to CEOs posted on the company’s website on Tuesday, Fink forecast a “fundamental reshaping of finance” and said companies must act or face anger from investors over how unsustainable business practices might curb their future wealth. The New York-based company's fourth-quarter net income here surged to $1.30 billion, or $8.29 per share, in the three months ended Dec. 31, from $927 million, or $5.78 per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, BlackRock earned $8.34 per share, while analysts had expected $7.69, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. “We had high expectations this quarter, just given the good market backdrop, and they still exceeded what the Street was looking for,” said Sanders. A thawing in U.S.-China trade tensions during the fourth quarter supported global equity markets, especially U.S. stocks. The benchmark S&P 500 index climbed 8.5% during the period, taking the year’s surge to 29%.

-10.961344088622917," BlackRock vows tougher stance on climate after activist heat LONDON/BOSTON (Reuters) - BlackRock BLK.N Chief Executive Larry Fink warned company boards to step up efforts to tackle climate change, a significant shift by the world's top asset manager as it faces mounting concerns about its fossil fuel investments. In his annual letter to CEOs posted on the company’s website on Tuesday, Fink forecast a “fundamental reshaping of finance” and said companies must act or face anger from investors over how unsustainable business practices might curb their future wealth. Fink also said BlackRock would “be increasingly disposed” to cast critical proxy votes tied to sustainability, and said in a separate letter to clients that the firm will by mid-2020 sell off from its actively managed client portfolios stakes in companies that derive more than 25% of their revenues from thermal coal production. Climate activists hailed Fink’s revamped stances and said they would put pressure on rivals, though some cautioned the New York-based asset manager must still back up its new rhetoric. “As the biggest financial institution in the world, BlackRock’s announcement today is a major step in the right direction and a testament to the power of public pressure calling for climate action,” said Ben Cushing of the U.S.-based environmental group Sierra Club, in an emailed statement. A shift in global investing trends has sent trillions of dollars into passive funds run by BlackRock and rivals Vanguard Group and State Street Corp, STT.N bringing all three powerful new leverage on top corporations. A Vanguard spokeswoman said the firm aims to address climate change “while adhering to our obligations to deliver long-term value to our fund holders.” State Street did not immediately respond to requests for comment. All three companies count clients with a wide range of political views and tried to represent their actions in terms of investment strategy rather than politics. Montana Senate Majority Leader Fred Thomas, a Republican and legislative liaison with the Montana Board of Investments, for which BlackRock manages assets, said he supports the use of many fuel sources including coal and that BlackRock should be wary of calls to move away from fossil fuels. “Any effort in my opinion to try to placate this environmental agenda just to get along and go along is a bad decision for any business,” Thomas said. A Reuters analysis in October found the top index fund managers rarely challenge company management and have largely opposed climate change proposals. In 2018 and 2019 BlackRock and Vanguard only backed around 10% of climate-related shareholder resolutions. Historically BlackRock has said it lobbies corporate executives behind the scenes, an approach that critics said undercuts other reform efforts. At Exxon Mobil's XOM.N annual meeting on May 29, for instance, BlackRock backed all but one of 10 directors up for election and opposed all but one of seven shareholder proposals, disclosures show. Fink on Tuesday said BlackRock would disclose its proxy votes quarterly and give more explanation about high-profile decisions. In an interview, Robert Jackson, a member of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, said he was “thrilled” with the step as a way to create more accountability for the votes. Investors have begun to put their money into more climate-friendly funds, albeit the overall size of the action is still small. New deposits into sustainable funds grew to $20 billion in 2019, according to data from Morningstar, nearly four times the previous year’s record. BlackRock has promised more focus on climate issues in the past but disappointed activists. The company did not make Fink or other executives available to comment. In an interview with CNBC Fink said, “More and more clients are looking for a more sustainable portfolio” and reiterated that companies should make more disclosures like those promoted by the Sustainability Accounting Standards Board. BlackRock did not give specific details on which companies it might divest or the size of those positions, and Fink wrote BlackRock will “continue to hold exposure to the hydrocarbon economy.” Historically even top U.S. coal producers make up just a small fraction of BlackRock’s active fund holdings. For instance as of May 31 the $861 million BlackRock Advantage Small Cap Core Fund BDSAX.O owned 29,965 shares of Arch Coal worth $2.64 million. Banks also have faced pressure to trim fossil fuel financing. Last week a group of institutional investors in Barclays BARC.L filed a resolution calling for it to stop financing firms not aligned with the Paris climate agreement. Seb Beloe, partner at sustainability-focused WHEB Asset Management in London, said BlackRock’s new stand will be helpful in pressing companies to think how they might operate under the goals of the Paris Agreement to limit global warming. “That’s exactly what we need companies to think hard about, in terms of how to contribute to the rapid deployment of solutions and to make their assets more resilient,” he said."
-7.426080794354656," BlackRock joins investor group seeking emission curbs BOSTON (Reuters) - Top asset manager BlackRock Inc BLK.N said on Thursday it has joined the Climate Action 100+ investor group seeking emission curbs. A spokesman for New York-based BlackRock said via e-mail that “evidence of the impact of climate risk on investment portfolios is building rapidly” and reiterated past comments the company will accelerate its talks with corporate executives on climate risk. Climate Action 100+ was begun in 2017 and includes nonprofit organizations and investors including units of HSBC Holdings PLC HSBA.L, Manulife Financial Corp MFC.TO and the California Public Employees' Retirement System. With some $7 trillion under management BlackRock has an influential voice on how large corporations act on climate matters such as greenhouse gas emissions. However to date BlackRock has taken few steps sought by critics such as backing shareholder resolutions calling for more emissions disclosures or giving details of its specific talks with corporate executives. The BlackRock spokesman, Farrell Denby, did not provide more details or make executives available for comment Several activists said they welcomed BlackRock’s step but are waiting to see what specific actions the asset manager might take. “BlackRock needs to lend its voice to the many involved in CA100+ calling for no new investment in expanding fossil fuel production,” said Mark Campanale, chairman of London-based climate researcher Carbon Tracker, via e-mail. In a statement on its website Climate Action 100+ steering committee member Mindy Lubber said that “With BlackRock’s commitment to the goals of the initiative, we will assuredly see more impactful results in tackling the global climate crisis.”"
-33.974263237517086," Breakingviews - BlackRock is Wall Street’s object of fantasy M&A NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Steve Schwarzman has one big regret. In 1994 the Blackstone boss sold a stake in some funds that later became BlackRock, the $7 trillion asset manager run by Larry Fink. Schwarzman describes the sale as “a heroic mistake.” It’s not too late to fix it. Yet he might not be alone in coveting the investment manager. The stability of BlackRock’s earnings has won it the respect from investors that its Wall Street peers, such as Goldman Sachs, covet. It fetches 16 times the next 12 months’ forecast earnings, according to Refinitiv, compared to 9 times for the investment bank and money manager helmed by David Solomon. Today, BlackRock serves opposite ends of the market from Blackstone and Goldman Sachs. Fink’s company houses two-thirds of its assets in exchange-traded and passively managed index funds. Blackstone’s $545 billion of private equity, real estate and other investments, managed for wealthy clients and institutions, are active. Ditto most of the $1.5 trillion Goldman oversees. Yet all are hungrily eyeing the middle. BlackRock’s fees from easy-to-trade products are under pressure amid tough competition, so Fink is growing alternative investments like private equity. Blackstone is eyeing more retail money – so it’s perhaps no wonder Schwarzman says he often pictures the two together. As for Goldman, it’s somewhere in between but looking to grow at both ends, having entered consumer financial services with its Marcus electronic bank and Apple credit card. Valuation has always been the obstacle, though needn’t be for much longer. Blackstone’s shares had risen around 85% in 2019 by mid-December, helped by a restructuring that let passive funds like BlackRock’s buy shares. The $63 billion buyout firm even trades at a higher multiple of 2020 earnings, after a decade of trading at a discount. Goldman is only a couple of billion dollars larger than BlackRock, which was worth $78 billion in mid-December. Mathematically, a merger of equals is doable. Fink has little reason to contemplate such a deal for now. But at 67, and an oft-cited contender to lead the Treasury under a Democratic president, succession is a live topic. One of the candidates to replace him, Mark Wiseman, was fired in December for having a relationship with a subordinate. Fink shouldn’t be surprised to see a pitchbook with his company’s name on it do the rounds on Wall Street in the year ahead. This is a Breakingviews prediction for 2020.

-33.974263237517086," Climate activists look for a tougher BlackRock in 2020 BOSTON/LONDON (Reuters) - Pressure on BlackRock Inc’s record on climate issues may be having an effect as the world’s largest asset manager weighs firming up its interactions with portfolio companies. The New York-based asset manager has stressed the importance of the societal issues known as ESG, like climate change and workforce diversity, that are popular with younger investors. So far BlackRock has resisted steps sought by critics, such as giving more details of its talks with oil company executives or backing many shareholder resolutions. But that may be changing as BlackRock prepares for the 2020 proxy season in the spring, said several people who have spoken with BlackRock BLK.N executives and hinted at by the company itself. In a statement emailed by a spokesman BlackRock said that “We share the concern about climate risk and its impact on shareholder value for all companies. Indeed, we believe evidence of the impact of climate risk on investment portfolios is building rapidly and we are accelerating our engagement with companies on this critical issue.” The spokesman, Ed Sweeney, did not provide more details. Moira Birss, a director of Amazon Watch, which advocates for indigenous peoples and rainforest conservation, said she expects BlackRock may change its engagements with agribusinesses based on recent conversations she held with BlackRock executives. “It’s a positive sign that BlackRock is willing to directly engage with us,” although it remains to be seen if satisfactory changes result, she said. Tim Smith of ESG-focussed money manager Boston Trust Walden, who often talks with BlackRock executives, said he expects them to press corporations harder in the coming year to adopt climate-impact reporting guidance. He said BlackRock executives seem more receptive to climate and other concerns heading into 2020, as competing asset managers take more aggressive stands on environmental matters. “They need to pay attention to this issue, especially if they lose business because of it,” he said. Activists say they will be watching for BlackRock CEO Larry Fink to outline some new approaches in his annual letter due in January. Most big fund firms face similar calls to become more active on ESG matters, which they must balance against other client priorities like performance. BlackRock draws the most attention because of its $7 trillion in assets and because it rarely challenges management, even at poor performers, as a Reuters analysis found. BlackRock says it lobbies effectively behind closed doors. Previously, BlackRock has made targeted changes like encouraging boards to have at least two women and urging companies to report according to the Financial Stability Board’s Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures. Critics say the quiet approach undercuts pressure from other shareholders. Cliff Weight, director at ShareSoc, the UK Individual Shareholder Society, said BlackRock could still give more details around its talks with companies. Of BlackRock’s current disclosures about its engagements, Weight said, “We question whether this is a marketing exercise” meant to impress clients. BlackRock also faces pressure from some public pension funds that have taken a harder look at the ESG practices of fund managers handling their money. Seattle public employee pension officials say they continue to monitor BlackRock’s interactions with companies whose shares it owns. The chief investment officer of Japan’s big Government Pension Investment Fund, Hiro Mizuno, has urged asset managers to incorporate ESG into their investment processes. Annual reports of the Japanese fund show BlackRock managed 2.7 trillion yen ($25 billion) in foreign equities passive money as of March, almost half as much as a year earlier. A fund spokeswoman declined to discuss the change and noted that factors like fees also weigh on allocation shifts. BlackRock has given little indication a deep stewardship overhaul is in store, though it has cast a number of high-profile critical votes. One came May 29 against Exxon Mobil Corp's XOM.N presiding director Steven Reinemund, BlackRock fund disclosures show. Asked about the vote, an Exxon spokeswoman said, “We welcome and value input from all shareholders.” BlackRock did not explain the vote or say if Exxon was the U.S.-based global energy company of which BlackRock reported it opposed a director due to “lack of progress on climate-related disclosure.”"

-2.9054201174426733," BlackRock global active equities chief to leave firm over relationship with colleague (Reuters) - Mark Wiseman, global head of active equities at BlackRock Inc BLK.N, is leaving the firm following a violation of the company's ""relationships at work policy,"" the world's largest asset manager said in an internal memo on Thursday. Wiseman, one of several people tipped as BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink’s possible successors, is a former Canadian pension manager who ran active equities and served as chairman of the $7 trillion indexing behemoth’s alternatives unit. “When the firm becomes aware of a breach of policy or conduct that is not in line with our values, we move quickly and decisively to address it,” Fink and BlackRock President Rob Kapito said in the memo, which was reviewed by Reuters. Fink, one of BlackRock’s founders in 1988, has not publicly named a successor or announced any plans to retire, but Wiseman was one of a handful of executives analysts have pointed to as a potential successor. In a separate memo to employees, Wiseman said, “I am leaving BlackRock because in recent months I engaged in a consensual relationship with one of our colleagues without reporting it as required by BlackRock’s Relationships at Work Policy. I regret my mistake and I accept responsibility for my actions.” Wiseman’s conduct had no impact on any portfolios or client activities, the first memo said. BlackRock’s active equity unit had about $290 billion in assets at the end of June. The leaders of the active equity teams who previously reported to Wiseman will now report to Kapito, the company said. “Mark was a high-profile addition to BlackRock with a distinguished background but BlackRock has a deep bench and a very strong leadership team,” Gabelli & Co analyst Macrae Sykes said. BlackRock hired Wiseman and his wife Marcia Moffat in recent years. Wiseman joined in May 2016 from the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, where he served as chief executive, while Moffat joined BlackRock from RBC in July 2015 to head the asset manager’s Canadian operations. The relationship that Wiseman failed to disclose was with a different BlackRock employee, the Wall Street Journal said on Thursday, citing an unidentified person familiar with the matter. The Financial Times also reported his departure earlier in the day. Wiseman is the second BlackRock senior executive to leave this year due to lapses in personal conduct. Jeff Smith, head of the human resources group at BlackRock, left in July because “he failed to adhere to company policy,” BlackRock said at the time. Earlier this year, BlackRock made several changes to its senior leadership ranks aimed at winning more business and boosting growth of its alternative investing business. BlackRock declined to comment beyond the contents of the memo. BlackRock shares, up about 24% this year, were 0.8% higher at $487.44 in morning trade on Thursday."

14.1416829814662," BlackRock's Rieder says Argentina debt 'pretty cheap' NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock's BLK.N top bond manager said on Thursday Argentina's debt is trading ""pretty cheap"" but he had no plans to buy more and would hold what he manages in the company's portfolio. “At these levels, we think organically the debt is pretty cheap at where it is trading,” said Rick Rieder, BlackRock’s Chief Investment Officer of Global Fixed Income during the Reuters Global Investment Outlook 2020 Summit. “I don’t anticipate where we would add to positions, but certainly in the funds I run directly we’re going to hold what we have,” he said. “It’s going to take a few months to play out.” Most of Argentina’s dollar-denominated debt is trading around 40 cents on the dollar. Alberto Fernandez, a Peronist who on Oct. 27 defeated business-friendly incumbent Mauricio Macri and will become Argentina’s president in December, made renegotiating a $57 billion program with the International Monetary Fund a key part of his election campaign. Fernandez said in an interview aired on Thursday that under current conditions Argentina would not be able to pay its debt."
14.1416829814662," Economically optimistic, BlackRock's Rieder takes on more risk NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc’s top bond investor has boosted risk exposure in recent weeks, on a view that the market is too bearish about chances of a U.S. recession, the Federal Reserve’s ability to support the economy and the resiliency of the U.S. consumer. Rick Rieder, chief investment officer for global fixed income, said he is optimistic about the state of the U.S. economy with consumers in “tremendous shape” based on factors such as their income, household net worth and their savings rate. As a result, “We have definitely gotten longer risk in the last 3-4 weeks,” Rieder said at the Reuters Global Investment Outlook 2020 Summit in New York on Thursday. “I think people have all gotten into cash and have all beared-up about the world coming to an end,” he said. Recession fears were compounded by anxiety about Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren rising in the polls for the Democratic presidential nomination, Rieder added. Warren has emerged as a front-runner along with former Vice President Joe Biden in the race for the Democratic nomination to face Republican President Donald Trump in the November 2020 election. Some investors fret about Warren’s plans to hike taxes on Wall Street, and regulate financial services more aggressively. U.S. stock markets sold off hard starting mid-September amid concerns about trade, politics and concerning U.S. manufacturing data. The market has recovered since and the benchmark S&P 500 index .SPX has since hit record highs. The U.S. economy’s big services sector can continue to grow without sparking inflationary pressure for finite resources in the way that manufacturing industries traditionally could not, Rieder said. “The consumer and services can keep the economy in good shape,” Rieder said. As BlackRock's BLK.N top bond investment officer Rieder oversees $2.3 trillion, about a third of the New York's firm's total assets under management. Betting against a near-term recession or further cuts in interest rates, Rieder is selling credit and buying agency mortgage-backed securities. One way the firm has taken advantage of the market’s heightened worries about the economic outlook is by writing covered calls - selling options against stock holdings. “We have some names that have done pretty well in some of our funds. We have been selling a decent amount of calls,” he said. Sellers of call options take on the obligation sell shares at a fixed price in the future. It is a neutral to moderately bullish strategy that seeks to harvest income from heightened volatility levels. Even though volatility selling has proven a crowded trade, reducing its attractiveness at the index level, the trade still had juice when implemented at the level of individual stock, he said. He declined to name particular companies in which BlackRock sold options. Rieder also said Fed officials have done a good job matching rate cuts to economic conditions, and said he hopes – and expects – the U.S. central bank will pause from further adjustments while waiting to see if inflation starts to hit 2% or perhaps higher. “I think they should stop now. I don’t think they should cut rates anymore from here. They should stop and get out of the way,” he said. Rieder also said the Fed’s operations to boost liquidity by purchasing about $60 billion per month in short-term Treasuries plays an under-appreciated role in keeping the economy humming. “You create a dynamic that’s much more important to the global economy and emerging markets than interest rates are, by a lot.” September’s sharp squeeze in money markets spurred the Fed into providing billions of dollars in daily cash injections and has reassured Rieder the U.S. central bank is back in the business of providing sorely needed liquidity, he said."
14.153316361060694," BlackRock's Rieder selling U.S. credit, buying mortgages NEW YORK (Reuters) - Betting against a near-term recession or further cuts in interest rates, BlackRock’s chief investment officer for global fixed income Rick Rieder is selling U.S. corporate debt and buying agency mortgage-backed securities. Rieder, whose business represents $2.3 trillion of the $7 trillion BlackRock has under management, said at the Reuters Investment Outlook 2020 Summit that he believed the Federal Reserve had stopped its rate-cutting cycle for now. While the manufacturing sector has been hit by the ongoing trade war with China, its contribution to U.S. gross domestic product has fallen dramatically in recent years. He was the third speaker at the November 2019 Reuters Summit to cite the opportunities available in the mortgage market. Dan Ivascyn, chief investment officer at PIMCO, said that mortgage-backed securities were creating today’s best investment opportunities. As the Fed cut interest rates three times this year, the interest rate on U.S. 30-year fixed-rate mortgages has fallen by more than a full percentage point. That has driven a wave of refinancing that helped cheapen mortgage bonds guaranteed by Fannie and Freddie. Andrew Hsu, portfolio manager at DoubleLine Capital, cited the opportunity in agency commercial mortgage-backed securities (CMBS). But Hsu was interested in CMBS in particular, because he believed that commercial borrowers were less likely to refinance their mortgages in a low-rate environment. Rieder, however, believes pre-payment speeds will remain moderate. “We’ve seen these interest-rate levels and we think you’re not going to see a pre-payment acceleration.” What’s more, he said he expects interest-rate volatility to remain low, which would benefit the mortgage market. Rieder also cited the growing demand from banks for mortgage-backed products, like JPMorgan JPM.N which reported significant growth in its securities business in the third quarter. Global banks earned $1 billion from trading agency MBS in the first half of 2019, a fivefold increase on last year for what industry sources say is the fastest growing revenue source in investment banking. Finally, Rieder said that spreads in investment-grade credit were no longer interesting, and liquidity in the market was thinner than that in the mortgage market. “In a world of uncertainty, I’d rather take more liquidity and a bigger buyer base.”"
14.153316361060694," September funding crunch a 'seminal moment' for Fed: BlackRock's Rieder (Reuters) - September’s sharp squeeze in money markets was scary but also proved to be instrumental in pulling the U.S. Federal Reserve off the sidelines, a moment that will prove pivotal for assets well beyond short-term funding markets, the head of fixed income for the world’s largest fund manager said on Thursday. Over the course of a handful of days in mid-September, cash available to banks for their short-term funding needs all but dried up, and interest rates in U.S. money markets shot up to as high as 10% for some overnight loans, more than four times the Fed’s rate. While jarring, the outcome of the event - with the Fed now providing billions of dollars in daily cash injections and building back up its stash of bonds through $60 billion a month of Treasury bill purchases - has reassured Rick Rieder, chief investment officer for fixed income at BlackRock Inc BLK.N, that the U.S. central bank is back in the business of providing sorely needed liquidity. The “funding scare was a seminal moment,” Rieder said at the Reuters Global Investment Outlook 2020 Summit. The Fed’s actions - in tandem with three interest rate cuts since July - have helped steepen the U.S. Treasury yield curve, which had dropped into so-called inversion over the summer. An inverted yield curve, when yields on shorter-duration bonds are higher than those for longer-dated maturities, is a classic signal of approaching economic recession. Since then, for instance, the spread between yields on 10-year and 2-year Treasury notes has climbed by nearly 30 basis points, from around negative 5 to around positive 25 now. That relieves pressure on banks whose margins had become compressed and lowers the risk of wider weakness in the economy and financial markets more broadly, he said. On top of that, U.S. stocks are back at record highs. “Adding liquidity to the system is incredibly powerful,” Rieder said. Moreover, Rieder said there is a reasonable chance the Fed will opt to remain in the balance sheet expansion business for longer than currently expected. At the moment, the Fed has signaled its plan is to buy $60 billion in bills a month through at least the first quarter of next year. But with its roughly $4 trillion balance sheet amounting to less than 20% of U.S. gross domestic product, the Fed has much more room to continue building its asset portfolio than its main counterparts in Europe and Japan, Rieder said. The European Central Bank’s asset holdings are the equivalent of nearly 40% of the trading bloc’s GDP, while the Bank of Japan’s are more than 100% of that economy’s annual output. Meanwhile, Rieder said the Fed is done cutting rates after having delivered three reductions since July. The Fed’s targeted overnight rate now stands at 1.50-1.75%, down from 2.25-2.50% at mid-year. That said, they are not going to reverse those cuts any time soon, according to Rieder. “I don’t think the Fed’s going to raise rates for a long time, and they’re going to let inflation run hot.”"

20.121485457246774," BlackRock beats profit estimates as assets swell to nearly $7 trillion NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc BLK.N, the world's largest asset manager, exceeded analysts' estimates for quarterly profit on Tuesday, as investors poured money into its fixed-income funds and cash management business amid worries about global growth. The company attracted $84.25 billion in new money during the third quarter, boosting its total assets managed to $6.96 trillion. Investors preferred BlackRock’s low-fee passive-investment products over its actively managed funds. BlackRock’s iShares ETFs took in $41.5 billion of new money, up 15% from the prior quarter. BlackRock’s cash management business drew net inflows of $32 billion in the third quarter, taking total assets for this business to $510 billion. “Whether there is risk-on trade in a quarter or risk-off trade in a quarter, we seem to be winning more share of wallet,” Chief Executive Larry Fink said in an interview with Reuters. Global financial markets were roiled in the third quarter amid heightened trade tensions between the United States and China. The trade dispute fueled worries over the outlook for global growth and weighed on investors’ appetite for riskier assets like stocks. “We are seeing de-risking and that’s why you are seeing a lot of money rotating into fixed income products as opposed to stock funds and you are also seeing a lot of money flowing into cash management products,” said Kyle Sanders, an analyst with St. Louis-based financial services firm Edward Jones. “What we like is the consistency in their ability to continue to capture assets, bring more in the door, regardless of what the market is doing,” he said. For the quarter ended Sept. 30, net income fell to $7.15 per share, down from $7.54 per share a year earlier, but topped analysts’ expectation for $6.96 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Lower-than-expected expenses helped BlackRock beat estimates, analysts said. Revenue rose by 3% to $3.69 billion, driven by higher base fees and technology services revenue, offset in part by lower performance fees, the company said. BlackRock, which is trying to become a bigger provider of technology used by Wall Street firms to combat competitive pricing pressures in the asset management business, grew technology unit revenue by 30% to $259 million. On a conference call with analysts, Fink said the recent move by brokerages to eliminate commissions on certain online trades would accelerate flows into BlackRock’s iShares business. “With the commission-free moves, we now have access to more clients than ever before,” he said. BlackRock shares were up 2.6% in late morning trade. Including Tuesday’s gains, the stock has climbed nearly 14% this year."

A company spokeswoman said the Riyadh office had opened recently and is headed by Yazeed Almubarak, who previously worked at Morgan Stanley MS.N and Saudi bank Jadwa Investment, according to his LinkedIn page. Chief Executive Larry Fink last year said that BlackRock would not cut ties with the kingdom, which came under pressure over the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Fink pulled out of a major investment conference in Riyadh at the time. BlackRock, with oversight of more than $6.4 trillion in assets, is widely followed by investors and economists for its influence at many of the world’s public companies. Plans to open an office in Saudi Arabia were announced in 2017 as Riyadh began courting investors to support its push to diversify the economy away from oil. Khashoggi, a critic of the kingdom’s de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, was murdered by Saudi agents inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October 2018. Saudi officials deny accusations that Prince Mohammed had a role in the killing, but Western governments continue to press for greater accountability."

21.35234066557949," BlackRock takes aim at CEOs serving on other companies' boards NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc BLK.N is stepping up opposition to U.S. CEOs who sit on more than one corporate board beside their own, arguing that working as a director takes increasingly more time, a report from the world's largest asset manager showed on Tuesday. BlackRock cast votes against 94 chief executives running for re-election to corporate boards outside of their own in this year’s proxy season, up from 32 last year, according to the report. The uptick reflects BlackRock’s concerns about CEOs over-extending themselves. It also represents a shift in its actions. Under its previous guidelines, the asset manager had considered two external director positions beyond the CEO’s own board as manageable. This is the first year the company is more strictly enforcing its new policy by voting against CEOs. “It sounds fine to sit on multiple boards, but what happens when something goes wrong at a company?” BlackRock Vice Chairman Barbara Novick said in an interview. “More and more companies are limiting how many outside boards their CEOs can sit on.” With $6.8 trillion in assets under management, BlackRock is an influential force in how boards of directors operate, and can swing votes in important corporate elections. BlackRock also voted this proxy season against directors at 52 companies included in the Russell 1000 index .RUI, because their boards had fewer than two women or no other directors of diverse ethnicity, age or certain other personal characteristics, according to the report. The asset manager says that diverse groups make better decisions. More than 45 people now work on BlackRock’s investment stewardship team around the world that is focused on holding corporate boards accountable to high governance standards, up from 16 a decade ago."

LTPC sits inside BlackRock's Alternative Investors segment, which oversees investment in real assets, private equity and private credit.

The fund will invest in corporate credit assets across geographies and industries, and seek value throughout the credit cycle, according to BlackRock, which had $6.84 trillion in assets under management as of June. Global Credit Opportunities’ fundraising builds on BlackRock’s broader push in establishing a global private credit franchise. In addition to opportunistic credit, over the last few years, BlackRock has expanded its private credit capabilities in Asian private credit, special situations, and U.S. and European middle market credit, including the acquisition of Tennenbaum Capital Partners in 2018. BlackRock’s Global Credit platform manages $100 billion in total client assets, and seeks to generate income and capital growth by targeting less liquid opportunistic, stressed and special situations investments. According to BlackRock’s 2019 Global Institutional Rebalancing Survey, 56% of global respondents planned to increase their allocations to private credit. “Investors looking for attractive risk-adjusted returns and portfolio diversification are increasingly looking to credit, where scale and expertise can help generate alpha,” said Tim O’Hara, global co-head of credit. “Building out our opportunistic credit strategy to take advantage of secular trends and cyclical dislocations in the credit markets is a natural evolution of our platform as we continue to bolster a credit business that can deliver for clients across risk spectrums and market cycles,” he said."

-1.7605617331526158," Exclusive: BlackRock in talks to take over Cofense after U.S. security concerns - sources (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc BLK.N, an investor in Cofense Inc, is in advanced talks to take over the U.S. cyber security firm, after a U.S. national security panel asked buyout firm Pamplona Capital Management LLP to sell its stake, people familiar with the matter said on Sunday. The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), which scrutinizes deals by foreign acquirers for potential national security concerns, has not disclosed why it asked Pamplona to sell its 47% stake in Leesburg, Virginia-based Cofense, which helps protect email users from phishing attacks. The development represents one of the rare, high-profile examples of CFIUS undoing a deal that had already been completed. A major investor in Pamplona’s private equity funds is Russian billionaire Mikhail Fridman, who was included in an “oligarchs’ watchlist” by the U.S. Treasury Department that could have resulted in sanctions against him because of his potential ties to the Kremlin. However, unlike other Russian oligarchs such as Oleg Deripaska and Viktor Vekselberg, Fridman has not been hit by U.S. sanctions. “The process remains ongoing and we are working diligently towards a solution,” Pamplona said in a statement, declining to comment further. Representatives for BlackRock, Cofense, Fridman and the U.S. Treasury, which chairs CFIUS, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Pamplona decided last October to launch an auction process to sell its stake after CFIUS approached it. Pamplona took the decision 10 months after acquiring Cofense with BlackRock, and other investors, including Adam Street Partners and Telstra Ventures, in a $400 million deal. BlackRock, which owns a 30% stake in Cofense, is the front-runner to buy Pamplona’s stake in a deal that could be reached as early as this week, the sources said. However, it is still possible that another bidder prevails or that negotiations will fall through, the sources added, asking not to be identified because the negotiations are confidential. A July 19 deadline agreed with CFIUS to reach a deal for Cofense has already lapsed. Complicating negotiations is the involvement of the U.S. government, which has formed a trustee with the company to oversee the sale, the sources said. The protracted process is also weighing on price negotiations. Pamplona is negotiating with BlackRock a mechanism of deferred payments that will be based on the future financial performance of Cofense, which it hopes will eventually lead to a deal value higher than last year’s investment, the sources said. It is also possible, however, that the deal ends up valuing Cofense, which was previously known as Phishme, lower than last year’s $400 million valuation, the sources added. Pamplona and BlackRock did not seek CFIUS approval when they completed their deal for Cofense last year, because the review system is voluntary and the firms thought there would be no national security concerns raised, according to the sources.

-5.206636595751802," BlackRock profit misses estimates, hit by lower fees for lending stocks NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc BLK.N, the world's largest asset manager, took in less cash last quarter as investors moved into lower-cost bond funds, and it made less money lending out stocks. The company, manager of $6.8 trillion in assets, missed analysts’ estimates for quarterly sales and profits on Friday, despite attracting $151 billion in new money, as much of that cash moved into lower-fee fixed income funds and accounts used to store cash. The company’s revenue for the three months through June 30 fell 2.2% to $3.52 billion from a year earlier, affected also by some fee cuts the company has made and lower fees for attaining performance targets. “While lower fee rates is a headwind that will likely continue, we believe BlackRock is happy to accept modest pricing declines in order to take large amounts of market share,” said Kyle Sanders, analyst at Edward Jones, which maintains its buy rating on BlackRock shares. Lower demand to borrow stocks also hurt fees. The borrowers are typically hedge funds that want to “short” those shares, selling the stocks and hoping to buy them back later at a lower cost. “I can’t control that; that’s more environmental,” said BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink in an interview. Shortseller Andrew Left of Citron Capital said in a recent investment letter that, because of the market rally, “it has been an extraordinarily challenging environment to be a short seller.” The benchmark S&P 500 overcame an escalation in the U.S.-China trade fight to close the first six months of this year up 17%, the best first-half performance for the index since 1997. Investors did pour more money into BlackRock’s actively managed funds aimed at beating the market over the low-fee passive-investment products. The company also reported 20% growth in its business unit that licenses software and other technology to other financial companies. “The trend going into the second half is very positive,” Fink said. “Things we can control ... were exceptional. It was probably one of our finest quarters in years of flows, in terms of engagement, and more importantly, when I talk about BlackRock, no organization has a combination of passive, active and technology.” Meanwhile, BlackRock said its iShares-branded ETFs took in $36.10 billion of new money, up from $30.69 billion in the preceding quarter. Net income attributable to New York-based BlackRock fell to $1 billion, or $6.41 per share, from $1.07 billion, or $6.62 per share, a year earlier. The company cited expenses related to recent acquisitions and a higher effective tax rate. Total expenses rose nearly 4% to $2.25 billion.

-5.206636595751802," BlackRock CEO Larry Fink says ECB must buy equities to stimulate euro zone NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock BLK.N Chief Executive Larry Fink said on Friday the European Central Bank will need to purchase equities to stimulate Europe's economy, and that leaders should find ways to have investors embrace an ""equity culture"" there. “I don’t see how if they (the ECB) do more easing, which means - deeper negative rates - I don’t know how that transmission (works) in the economy,” Fink told Reuters in a telephone interview, following BlackRock’s earnings results. BlackRock is the world’s largest asset manager, and Fink is widely followed by investors, traders and economists for his views on financial markets and the global economy. “European equities trade at multiple points below the U.S. because they don’t have an equity culture,” he said. “I am a big believer that Europe needs to find ways to have the Europeans focusing on investing for the long term through equities.” German news magazine Der Spiegel cited central bank sources on Friday as saying ECB President Mario Draghi planned to restart purchases of government bonds by November to support the fragile euro zone economy. The magazine also said Draghi hoped the move would encourage companies to invest more and consumers to spend more. Fink said loose monetary policy has been most effective in the United States because of Americans’ longstanding embrace of equities and their exposure to that market. “It makes sense in the U.S. economy,” he said. “It makes much less sense in economies where most of the pool of assets of individuals are sitting in a bank account. I see negative impact. That is why I’ve always questioned monetary policy without a large, I would say, equity culture. That’s really what’s happened in Japan and in Europe.” Fink said the monetization of financial assets in Europe, especially now with over 50% of its debt yielding below zero, “actually harms the psychology of savers. So this is why I believe Europe has not grown to the extent of the U.S.” He also said Europe has been “so reliant on monetary policy and so little fiscal policy. That will be one of the long-term mistakes of Europe. “Unfortunately, the only name in town is the ECB,” Fink said. “They’re trying to do whatever they can do to do it. I think now with all the negative rates, and with 82% of savings in a bank account, I just don’t see how that transmission works as well as lowering rates in the United States.”"

-4.334334551292057," Lords of the Ring: Can 'smart' ring give BlackRock fund managers the edge? LONDON (Reuters) - After years of using the internet, satellites, algos and other innovations to mine ‘Big Data’ for that edge over rivals, the world’s biggest investment firm is trialing a gizmo that puts the focus back on humans -- its own portfolio managers. In an world where marginal gains can translate into millions of dollars of returns BlackRock, which manages $6.5 trillion in assets, is betting that healthier, happier fund managers make smarter investment decisions -- and wearable smart technology can help optimize their performance. Several fund managers from BlackRock’s European equities team now wear smart-tech rings that collate data on their sleep patterns, heart rate and other health indicators, according to three sources at the firm who are familiar with the trial. The large, black ring is made by Oura, an Finland-based company which describes the $300 ring on its website as “a secret weapon for personal improvement”. The ring is worn by managers on a voluntary basis and can be removed at any time, the sources told Reuters. The ring can gauge how much they have slept, or if they have an elevated heart rate indicating higher stress levels, when making an investment decision, one source said. The project is managed by a trained psychologist who heads BlackRock’s behavioral finance initiative and aims to help portfolio managers manage stress, sleep patterns and activity levels, according to a source familiar with the process. By participating in the scheme, managers consent to share their data with BlackRock’s behavioral finance team, though it may be shared more broadly in an aggregate or anonymized format. “Individuals control and own their own data, and who sees it,” the source said. “It isn’t just about performance and risk taking but about their own wellness.” The ring was introduced in January and is currently worn by up to 10 managers, the source said. The firm could roll it out further depending on the success of the trial, the person added. The initiative comes at a time of unprecedented change for the industry, as tougher regulations and a squeeze on fees pressure money managers to stand out from rivals. But it also shows big asset managers such as BlackRock continue to invest in optimizing human performance, despite the growing popularity of ‘passive’ investing, which is based on index-tracking, with minimum buying and selling. But while BlackRock stresses the prime motivation is promoting wellness, not everyone might welcome a scheme that collects employees’ personal data, especially in an industry where performance is already meticulously tracked. BlackRock money managers currently use a system called ‘Aladdin’ which provides the risk-management and trading tools as well as analytics to help them make investment decisions. Whether the smart ring has actually sharpened managers’ investment decisions remains to be seen. The sources said the results were not yet available."

-7.459284429352563," Rome scrambles to swerve Carige bank bailout after BlackRock pulls out MILAN (Reuters) - Rome’s fragile government battled to avoid another costly bank bailout on Thursday after U.S. fund manager BlackRock ditched a proposed rescue of Italy’s Carige. BlackRock and Carige gave no reason for the decision, which highlights investor concerns about Italy’s uncertain political environment as time runs out for the troubled bank. Economy Minister Giovanni Tria said he was confident a market solution could still be found, telling reporters in Rome that the bank’s commissioners were seeking an alternative investor and that the work done so far would not be wasted. Political infighting and the fact it was unable to keep its stake below 25 percent were among the factors that persuaded BlackRock to back out, a source familiar with the matter said. Under the plan, based on a 720 million euro ($806 million) capital injection, Italian banks were set to take up some of Carige’s shares by converting a bond into equity. But without more investors, BlackRock’s stake would have exceeded a quarter. The rescue aimed to help the state avoid its fourth major bank bailout in two years. The government has earmarked up to 1 billion euros to buy Carige shares if it cannot find investors. A state bail-out would potentially embarrass the ruling parties, the right-wing League and the anti-establishment 5-Star Movement, which both attacked previous governments over the use of public funds to save ailing banks. Carige, which has been put under special administration by the European Central Bank, said it was looking at other market solutions to its capital shortfall after BlackRock’s move but said it could also seek government financial aid. “We will evaluate other market solutions aimed at ensuring the stability and turnaround of Banca Carige,” it said in a statement, adding it could still make a “request for a precautionary recapitalisation to the economy ministry.” The ECB, which sources have said has set a mid-May deadline for investors to submit binding bids for Carige, said on Thursday it had been informed of developments and was in contact with Carige’s temporary administrators. Carige has been laid low by years of mismanagement and an excessive exposure to the depressed economy of Italy’s northwestern Liguria region. Italian bond yields have risen in recent days on concerns over tension within Rome’s ruling coalition, with the gap between its benchmark bond yields and safer German Bunds increasing on Wednesday to the widest in more than two months.

-7.459284429352563," Breakingviews - BlackRock’s Italian U-turn leaves state on hook LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - BlackRock’s U-turn on a daring Italian bank rescue puts Rome back on the hook. The world’s biggest asset manager on Thursday confirmed it had dropped plans to join a 720 million euro rescue for ailing bank Carige. The abrupt decision after months of discussions is a belated admission the project was too risky. That is bad news for Italy’s taxpayers. A special situations fund managed by BlackRock had been planning to inject cash into loss-making Carige along with a solidarity fund owned by Italian banks and other investors. Though the rescue of Italy’s last midsized problem lender had not been finalised, it was at an advanced stage. The solidarity fund officially endorsed it on Monday by pledging to convert hybrid bonds worth 313 million euros into Carige shares. The participants were due to present the plan to the European Central Bank next week. Given the deal’s high political profile, it’s surprising that the asset manager run by Larry Fink waited so long before walking away. The plan always looked overly ambitious, though. According to Il Messaggero, BlackRock expected Carige to break even in 2020 and deliver net income of 160 million euros by 2023 – earning an 8 percent return on equity of 1.9 billion euros. That’s double the 4 percent average return produced by Italian banks in 2018, BLN data show. Turning around the weakened Carige brand in Italy’s stagnating economy was a tall order. BlackRock’s change of heart removes the last market-based option for fixing Carige. The group run by former UBS banker Fabio Innocenzi was put under direct ECB control in January after failing to raise enough cash to absorb loan losses. Another potential investor, U.S. fund Varde Partners, walked away earlier this year after balking at the poor quality of the bank’s assets, according to a person familiar with the situation. Italian banks have stayed on the sidelines, hoping the state would pay them to ride to the rescue, as when Intesa Sanpaolo snapped up two failed Veneto-based lenders in 2017. The buck is now likely to stop with the Italian government, which has pledged to inject up to 1 billion euros into Carige to calm nervous depositors. As with other failed Italian banks, taxpayers might have to pick up the tab."

-7.8354443555604005," Italian banks back BlackRock's 720 million euro Carige rescue plan MILAN (Reuters) - Italian banks have backed a 720 million euro rescue plan ($806 million) for rival Carige that will hand control of the Genoa-based bank to U.S. asset manager BlackRock, the head of a banking fund said on Monday. Carige was placed under special administration by the European Central Bank at the start of the year after Italy’s Malacalza family, the lender’s top shareholder, blocked a proposed cash call, derailing an industry-financed rescue. Italian banks bought a 320 million euro hybrid bond issued by Carige in November to beef up its capital reserves. The investment was carried out through the voluntary-contribution arm of Italy’s FITD depositor protection fund. Speaking to reporters on Monday after a meeting of the voluntary scheme’s steering committee, FITD chairman Salvatore Maccarone said banks were set to convert 313 million euros worth of the hybrid bond into equity, giving them a roughly 43 percent stake in Carige. The debt-to-equity conversion is expected to receive final approval at an FITD general meeting on May 14, he said, adding the whole rescue plan, which includes the issue of further additional shares, would then be presented to the European Central Bank on May 17. “It’s a deal which we believe will solve (Carige’s) problems once and for all,” Maccarone said. The exact size of BlackRock’s investment is not yet known but it will cover the remainder of the new share issue apart from a small amount which will be available to current shareholders. BlackRock will take operational control and name a new chief executive, Maccarone said. The deal needs to be approved by Carige’s shareholders, meaning the position of the Malacalza family, which holds a 27.6 percent stake, will be key. A shareholder meeting to vote on the plan is expected to take place in June or July, trade union FABI said in a statement after a meeting with the bank’s special administrators. The union said the cash call should take place after the summer and that no additional job cuts were planned beyond the 1,250 cuts already announced in February. The family of steel billionaires will see its holding heavily diluted, even if it buys into the portion of the cash call reserved for current shareholders. The Malacalzas have invested more than 400 million euros in Carige since 2015, although their stake was worth just 23 million euros when the bank was placed under special administration and trading in the stock halted. The government has earmarked up to 1 billion euros to buy Carige shares and stands ready to step in should a private investor fail to seal a deal. State-owned soured loan vehicle SGA will take on the bank’s bad loans under the plan. “The overall deal has a number of pieces that must fall into place”, Maccarone said, including BlackRock being granted a waiver from a regulatory obligation to launch a full takeover bid for the bank. Carige has been laid low by years of mismanagement and an excessive exposure to the depressed economy of the northwestern Liguria region."

Lopez Obrador told a news conference on Thursday that BlackRock’s letter, dated April 18, expressed “confidence in the country.” Despite vows to boost both private and public investment, Lopez Obrador’s economic decision-making has rattled investors. In particular, his cancellation of a partly built $13 billion Mexico City airport in October, a few weeks before taking office, sparked billions of dollars of losses on Mexican financial markets. The leftist leader has called for installing a fiber-optic cable throughout areas with poor connectivity, as well as free internet in public places. He has also proposed infrastructure projects in the long-neglected southern region, including a train linking the Pacific Ocean with the Gulf of Mexico across the isthmus of Tehuantepec. Private sector analysts have been cutting their Mexican growth forecasts for 2019. Fink said BlackRock was “firmly committed” to Mexico. The asset manager has raised hundreds of millions of dollars to invest Mexico, including a focus on infrastructure."

-0.653077930194481," Italian bank fund could take Carige stake in BlackRock rescue: Intesa CEO TURIN, Italy (Reuters) - A rescue plan for Italy’s Carige by U.S. asset manager BlackRock would allow a fund financed by Italian lenders to take part in a cash call at the Genoa-based bank, the chief executive of Intesa Sanpaolo said on Tuesday. Carlo Messina said the BlackRock proposal was consistent with a restructuring plan drafted by Carige’s temporary administrators which allowed the Italian banking fund to take a stake by converting debt into equity. Italian banks propped up Carige in November by buying a 320 million euro hybrid bond to beef up its total capital via the voluntary-contribution arm of a depositor guarantee fund. Messina told shareholders that Intesa indirectly held 25.3 percent of that bond through the fund. “It appears the deal proposed by BlackRock is in line with the relaunch plan drawn up by the bank’s commissioners,” Messina said at Intesa’s annual general meeting. The European Central Bank (ECB) appointed temporary administrators to run Carige at the start of the year after the top shareholder in Italy’s 10th-largest bank in December blocked a 400 million euro cash call. The cash call was part of an industry-financed rescue that would have seen lenders convert the 320 million euro bond. The commissioners are now looking for a buyer to fill a capital shortfall which has swelled to 630 million euros. However, sources have said the BlackRock plan may envisage an even bigger cash call to build up a capital buffer. The ECB has extended until mid-May a bid deadline to give more time to BlackRock, the only known potential buyer through one of its funds specializing in restructuring."

About 30 billion euros ($34 billion) has been wiped off the German drugmaker’s market value since August, when a U.S. jury found Bayer liable because Monsanto, which it bought for $63 billion last year, had not warned of alleged cancer risks linked to its weedkiller Roundup. Bayer suffered a similar courtroom defeat last month and more than 11,000 plaintiffs are claiming damages. BlackRock, which latest filings show owns 7.2 percent of Bayer’s voting rights, plans to either abstain from or vote against ratifying the management board’s actions during the year under review, the sources said. The largely symbolic vote of confidence “will send a message to the board” that BlackRock is not happy with the way Bayer’s management handled the Monsanto deal, one of the sources said. A vote to ratify the board’s actions features prominently at every German AGM. It has no bearing on management’s liability, but is seen as a key gauge of shareholder sentiment. Bayer’s next two biggest shareholders, Singapore state investor Temasek and Norway’s oil fund, both declined to comment on their AGM voting intentions when contacted by Reuters.

2.7674466386882677," No signs of global recession in next 12 months: BlackRock's Fink BERLIN (Reuters) - There are no signs that the global economy is sliding toward a recession in the next 12 months, BlackRock Inc’s Chief Executive Larry Fink said in remarks published on Saturday. In an interview with German business daily Handelsblatt, Fink warned, however, that the global economy was in the late stage of a long growth cycle, suggesting that downturn was becoming more likely. “I see no signs of a global recession in the coming 12 months,” said Fink, who leads the world’s largest asset manager. “The central banks have loosened their policy above all because of the weak fourth quarter of 2018. We will go through a phase in which things are not great but also not bad.” He added: “But we are naturally in a late phase of the economic growth cycle.” The International Monetary Fund cut its global economic growth forecasts for 2019 this month and said growth could slow further due to unresolved trade disputes and the risk of Britain leaving the European Union without a deal. The global lender said some major economies, including China and Germany, might need to take short-term actions to prop up growth and that a severe downturn could require coordinated stimulus measures. German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz has ruled out taking on new debt to stimulate growth in Europe’s biggest economy, saying tax cuts, higher investments and a solid labor market will continue to provide growth impetus."
2.81002553374746," BlackRock's plan for Italy's Carige sees higher cash call: sources ROME/MILAN (Reuters) - Troubled Italian bank Carige could need a larger-than-expected cash injection of at least 700 million euros ($791 mln) under a rescue plan put forward by U.S. asset manager BlackRock, two sources familiar with the matter said. Temporary administrators appointed by the European Central Bank to run Carige are trying to find a buyer for Italy’s 10th-largest bank by mid-May, after its top shareholder derailed an industry-financed rescue by blocking a 400 million euro cash call in December. A specialist fund run by BlackRock is the only known potential bidder although Italy’s government stands ready to step in should a private buyer fail to clinch a deal. The government, which in 2017 took over Italy’s then third-largest bank Monte dei Paschi di Siena, has earmarked up to 1 billion euros to buy Carige shares by the end of September under emergency measures approved at the start of the year. Reporting a 273 million euro loss for 2018 due to the amount of bad loans it held, the Genoa-based lender said in February it needed to fill a 630 million euro capital shortfall. Its cash needs could now swell further as the potential buyer looks to build a capital buffer to hedge against possible setbacks in the restructuring process, a third source said. A fourth source said BlackRock wanted to avoid potential future capital shortfalls in light of some guidelines set by the ECB in relation to Carige. Both the ECB and BlackRock declined to comment. The BlackRock fund, which is advised by Mediobanca, is in talks with the Italian lenders who came to Carige’s rescue in November by buying a 320 million euro hybrid bond issued by bank to boost its total capital ratio. A conversion of that bond into equity to reduce the investment required by the BlackRock fund was discussed at a meeting among Italian banks on Wednesday. The conversion appears likely to take place although no final decision has yet been taken, according to the head of a depositor guarantee fund which bought the Carige bond on behalf of banks."

1.521804778223121," BlackRock strategists advocate trimming investment portfolio risk NEW YORK (Reuters) - Strategists at the world’s largest asset manager BlackRock Inc told their financial adviser clients on Wednesday to look at cutting back on risk and lower expectations for high returns on stocks and bonds. “We may get another leg-up from earnings but I would say the type of returns we experienced in the first quarter should not be extrapolated,” BlackRock’s chief equity strategist Kate Moore said during its quarterly U.S. wealth advisory event, which was attended over the web by about 1,300 of its financial adviser clients. “We just want to be conscious of the fact that for both equities and bonds, the types of returns that you’ve experienced - not just in 2019 but over the course of the last decade and before - are going to be difficult to replicate,” said Moore. U.S. stocks have appreciated sharply in recent years, thanks in part to steps the U.S. Federal Reserve took to resuscitate the U.S. economy after the financial crises of 2007-09, but worries abound that investors may be in a late-cycle environment, BlackRock strategists said. Indeed, the benchmark S&P 500 stock index has gained about 16 percent in 2019 due to monetary and fiscal stimulus efforts in China and signs the U.S. Federal Reserve will delay further rate hikes for the time being. In general, the recent market gyrations have not spurred financial advisers into action, Patrick Nolan, a senior strategist with BlackRock’s portfolio solutions team, said. Faced with bouts of volatility, investors can pick from one of three options, Nolan said. They could treat market gyrations as noise and largely ignore them, Nolan said. Alternatively they could react very strongly and dump risky assets, he said. The third option is to add more protection in portfolios even as one remains positioned to take part in any gains if markets grind higher, he said. “It looks to us like adviser models are still taking option one. We actually think option three might be a better path from here,” said Nolan. To do this, BlackRock’s head of factor investing, Andrew Ang, favors quality - an approach where the focus is on companies that have a track record of stable earnings, are productive and sport a relatively lower level of debt. “When we take that sort of position we can still participate in the upside for markets but we do that with a more defensive posture,” said Ang. On Tuesday, BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink said the U.S. economy is speeding up again after a slowdown in recent months and cash could soon start rushing into stocks as most investors are underinvested in the markets globally. BlackRock’s Moore agrees. She said a continued dovish tone from the Fed and global central banks, coupled with stabilizing economic growth and an improvement in the outlook for corporate earnings, could still help drive stocks higher. “The pain trade is higher,” she said."

U.S. stocks stumbled late last year due to fears about a global slowdown and about the potential fallout from U.S.-China trade tensions. A partial U.S. government shutdown and mixed economic data added to investor concerns earlier this year.

3.061173701131282," BlackRock profit beats estimates as assets rebound above $6 trillion NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc, the world’s largest asset manager, reported first-quarter profit that exceeded expectations and raked in $65 billion of new investor cash as global financial markets rebounded from a volatile fourth quarter. Total assets under management grew 3% to $6.52 trillion in the quarter through March 31 from a year earlier, amid a broad-based rebound in global equity markets. Assets had dipped below $6 trillion amid market turmoil late last year. Total quarterly net inflows across all product types jumped 13.6 percent to $64.67 billion from a year earlier. Overall, the company sold $59 billion in stock, bond and other “long-term” investment funds, up from the $43.6 billion in the quarter ended Dec. 31. BlackRock shares were up 2.2% at $461.56 in early trading. The U.S. economy is speeding up again after a slowdown and the market is getting ready for “huge” inflows into stocks, BlackRock Inc’s Chief Executive Larry Fink told Reuters in an interview on Tuesday. “I believe people are still under-risked, despite the big rebound,” Fink said. The benchmark S&P 500 stock index, which sank 14 percent in the final three months of 2018, rebounded by 13 percent in the first quarter, its best performance since the third quarter of 2009. BlackRock lost more than $26 billion in its equity portfolio during the first quarter, but this was more than offset by a jump in fixed income of nearly $80 billion. Long-term investments rose by $59 billion. “Investment flows look stronger than we anticipated,” said Kyle Sanders, an analyst with St. Louis-based financial services firm Edward Jones. “BlackRock has a really strong reputation in fixed income management and it looks like that asset class came back into favor with interest rates kind of dipping lower. I think that drove better-than-expected asset flows,” said Sanders. Institutional fund net inflows grew nearly nine-fold to $29.12 billion from a year ago. Net income attributable to BlackRock fell to $1.05 billion, or $6.61 per share, in the first quarter, from $1.09 billion, or $6.68 per share, a year earlier. That well exceeded analysts’ expectations for a profit of $6.13 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. BlackRock said its iShares-branded ETFs took in $30.69 billion of new money, compared with $81.40 billion in the fourth quarter. Revenue from technology services, a key area of focus for BlackRock, grew 11 percent to $204 million. Still, the company continued to feel the pinch from fee pressures amid an ongoing industry-wide shift from high-fee actively managed mutual funds to low-fee passive-investment products. Base fees dropped 5% year-over-year, mainly due to the negative markets in the fourth quarter and a stronger U.S. dollar that eroded the fees they collect, BlackRock said. “I think it was pretty well known that fees would be down, not just for BlackRock but for any asset manager just because those are based on an average of market values throughout the quarter and we started the quarter at such a low point,” said Edward Jones’ Sanders."

Fink was awarded $26.5 million in compensation last year, compared with $27.7 million in 2017, based on a calculation of his pay in line with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission guidelines. Going by a set of calculations BlackRock prefers, Fink’s total compensation for the year fell 14% to $24 million. The figures differ because BlackRock reports some incentive pay in a different year. “BlackRock’s Board of Directors and I both believe that the performance of our stock price should be a factor in determining the compensation of our senior executives,” Fink, who is often quoted for his views on the markets and corporate governance and has been listed among the world’s best CEOs by the newspaper Barron’s, said in the filing. BlackRock’s stock slid 23.5% in price during 2018, its worst performance since 2008, as a severe bout of volatility buffeted financial markets. That compares with a 27.3% fall for a Thomson Reuters index that includes more than a dozen of BlackRock’s industry rivals in the United States. The shares hit a six-month high of $457.33 on Friday. Fink’s pay is among the highest in investment management globally as well as among U.S. financial firms, according to Thomson Reuters data. In the past the company’s pay to executive officers has drawn criticism from proxy adviser Glass Lewis & Co LLC.

Rising demand for more diversified and long-term investment solutions in China was likely to drive the growth in assets under management in Asia by 50 percent over the next five years, Fink said in his annual letter bit.ly/2OXDWoE to shareholders published on Monday. The chief executive of the world’s largest asset manager said his China ambitions have not been dented by the prolonged tariff war between the United States and China.

9.091405870690227," BlackRock could be given more time for Carige bid: sources ROME/MILAN (Reuters) - A specialist fund run by BlackRock could be given extra time to bid for troubled Italian lender Carige, three sources familiar with the matter said. Carige was placed under special administration at the start of the year after its top investor blocked a planned capital raising, derailing an industry-financed rescue plan. The BlackRock fund has remained as the only buyer still known to be considering a bid as U.S. fund Varde Partners this week decided to walk away after due diligence showed Carige was not a good investment opportunity for the Minnesota-based fund. The European Central Bank last week extended to the end of September a mandate to three commissioners who have been put in charge of the Italian bank and asked to find a buyer. One of the commissioners said last month offers for Carige were expected by mid-April, but this deadline could now be extended to the end of the month, one source said. A second source, however, said there may be more clarity on a possible offer by the BlackRock fund by the end of the week. The fund has not taken a final decision yet on whether to submit a bid and the tight deadline is complicating matters, a source familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. Separately, two sources said BlackRock was in talks with Carige’s single biggest shareholder, the Malacalza family, who own 27.5 percent of the bank, over a possible co-investment.

9.091405870690227," BlackRock could be given more time to present bid for Carige-sources ROME/MILAN, April 3 (Reuters) - A specialist fund run by U.S. asset manager BlackRock could be given more time to present an offer for troubled Italian lender Carige, three sources familiar with the matter said, as an April deadline looms. Carige was placed under special administration at the start of the year after its top investor in December blocked a planned capital raising, derailing a rescue plan financed by the industry. The European Central Bank last week extended to the end of September a mandate to three commissioners who have been put in charge of the bank and asked to find a buyer. One of the commissioners said last month offers for Carige were expected by mid-April. One of the sources said the deadline could be extended to the end of the month.

8.48107335371235," BlackRock's Larry Fink overhauls leadership ranks in key business units NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc, the world’s largest asset manager, has made changes to its senior leadership ranks aimed at winning more business from top institutional clients and boosting growth of its alternative investing business, according to a memo seen by Reuters on Tuesday. BlackRock, with more than $6 trillion in assets under management, is giving primary responsibility for those institutional clients to executives in local regions. It is also putting Edwin Conway in charge of BlackRock Alternative Investors, a group of complex investment products that Chief Executive Larry Fink thinks can amp up the company’s profits. BlackRock, known best for funds that track the stock and bond markets, has been putting more emphasis on so-called illiquid alternative investments, complex investments including private equity and real estate that typically come with higher fees and are more likely to be sold to an institution than a mom-and-pop investor. Conway, previously head of Blackrock’s institutional client business, will succeed David Blumer, who is becoming an adviser. The alternative group’s chairman is Mark Wiseman, one of several people tipped as Fink’s possible successors . As part of the changes, Mark McCombe, another potential Fink successor, takes on a new role as chief client officer to work with global clients, including governments, financial companies and investment consultants that steer money from big clients, such as pension funds. Rob Fairbairn, who is already responsible for some top clients, becomes a vice chairman. Fink, one of BlackRock’s founders in 1988, has neither signaled any intention to leave nor publicly named a successor. He told analysts last year that he thinks the alternative investments business can be a source of major growth for the company. Asset managers have been squeezed by rising competition and pressure to reduce fees, and in recent months many have been cutting jobs and costs. Even BlackRock, which has benefited by offering low-cost exchange-traded funds, announced layoffs in January. At the time Fink pledged to continue investing in what he sees as growth opportunities. The changes “show our commitment to constant reinvention and to the ongoing development of our senior leaders,” Fink and BlackRock President Rob Kapito wrote in the memo. “They are also designed to reinvigorate our approach at every level of the firm – and with every employee – at a critical time.” Other changes announced on Tuesday included naming a new head of its Latin American business and corporate strategy. BlackRock elevated a new chief product officer, Patrick Olson, to a role that had been unfilled. Richard Prager, who runs the company’s trading and its lucrative operations lending out stocks, will retire. And Rick Rieder, a top BlackRock investor and global chief investment officer of fixed income, will be leading a “Global Allocation” team that picks investments across stocks, bonds and commodities."

The deal is likely a relief for the engineering and construction company, which has seen its financials suffer as a result of stalled projects and payments held back by the government against claims by contractors. A part of the consideration it receives will be used to prepay debts worth 12.50 billion rupees, and the deal will result in a partial write-down of the company's net worth as on March 31, HCC said in a statement here. The value of the awards and claims is pegged at 20 billion rupees, it added. HCC will set up a special purpose vehicle to carry out the transaction, which will issue non-convertible debentures to the investors. The company had gross debt of 34.90 billion rupees as of Dec. 31, 2018, and its order backlog stood at 182.13 billion rupees, HCC said in its latest quarterly report. As on March 31, 2018, the company had won arbitration claims amounting to 48.23 billion rupees, of which it had collected 14.16 billion rupees, according to its annual report for the year ended March 2018.

11.183553174857167," UPDATE 1-BlackRock, Varde set to submit bids for Italy's Carige -sources (Adds details) MILAN, March 25 (Reuters) - U.S. funds Varde Partners and BlackRock plan to submit rival bids for troubled Italian lender Banca Carige by mid-April, three sources close to the matter said on Monday. The European Central Bank on Jan. 2 placed Italy’s 10th largest bank under special administration and asked it to find a buyer to stave off the risk of state intervention. The Genoa-based bank has said it needs to raise 630 million euros ($713 million) in capital after reporting a 2018 loss of 273 million euros. It has 3.5 billion euros in bad loans and has already launched three cash calls since 2014. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is particularly interested in Carige’s bad loans and in its private banking unit Banca Cesare Ponti, two of the sources said. Apollo Global Management, which already owns Carige’s insurance units, had initially also expressed an interest in buying the bank, but has now pulled out, one source said. Apollo had no immediate comment. Carige declined to comment. The bidders face two potential hurdles. One is Carige’s biggest investor, the Malacalza family, which owns 27.5 percent of the bank and in December voted against a capital increase. Any bidder would need to get the Malacalzas on board to succeed or it would risk being voted down at a shareholder meeting called to approve the deal. The family could buy into the capital increase to avoid being heavily diluted. It has invested more than 400 million euros in Carige since 2015 to build a stake, which was worth 23 million euros before trading in the stock was halted when the bank was placed under special administration. The second potential problem is the price at which either Varde or BlackRock would buy the bank’s bad loans. The 630-million-euro capital hole has been calculated on the basis of an offer for 1.9 billion euros worth of bad loans that Carige has already received from state-owned debt recovery specialist SGA, a company owned by the Italian treasury. Should Varde or BlackRock offer a lower price for the soured debts, where funds typically aim to make big returns, the capital shortfall would be bigger. The SGA offer remains on the table to give Carige’s commissioners the option of selling a cleaned-up bank or if a private takeover fails and the bank needs an injection of state money. Under a January emergency decree, Italy’s government can buy up to 1 billion euros worth of Carige’s shares.

5.490839905211857," RPT-Blackstone joins KKR and BlackRock in Mexico private equity fundraising (Repeats with no changes) MEXICO CITY, March 19 (Reuters) - Blackstone Group has raised $695 million from Mexican pension funds for its first two local private equity funds, filings showed, joining Black Rock and KKR & Co in expanding in Mexico following regulatory changes. Several of the world’s top private equity managers have quietly raised billions of dollars from Mexican pension funds, known as afores, since new rules were enacted early last year, filings to the Mexican Stock Exchange and a non-public document reviewed by Reuters showed. Regulators have authorized some managers to raise more over time. It was not immediately clear how much in total has been raised to date in Mexico by equity managers, which include Discovery Capital Management, General Atlantic, Partners Group, Lexington Partners and HarbourVest Partners. Their arrival in Latin America’s second-largest economy comes after a regulatory change in January 2018 that allowed foreign private equity managers to tap into $179 billion worth of pension fund assets for the first time and eased some restrictions on how pension funds invest their assets. Mexico’s lower house of Congress is about to vote on a draft law by Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador’s ruling National Regeneration Movement (MORENA) that would give pension funds further flexibility. Blackstone Managing Director Matthew Pedley said in an interview that pension funds were taking advantage of the recent change in regulation to add exposure to international alternatives and diversify their portfolios. Others consulted by Reuters on their funds in Mexico declined to be identified. The private equity funds could help Mexican pension funds spread risk with international investments ranging from infrastructure to energy and special situations hedge funds. Luis Sayeg, investment management director at Citibanamex, which manages one of the leading pension funds in the country, said the new funds could benefit pensions. “It is a new opportunity to diversify the portfolio into alternative asset classes, with likely attractive returns, that do not necessarily exist in Mexico,” Sayeg said. The draft law was praised by ratings agency Fitch although some critics have expressed concern that the government wants to tap pensions to help finance pet projects. Black Rock was one of the first foreign asset managers to expand into Mexico, raising $615 million for two funds, one of which will focus on infrastructure investments, a non-public document detailing fundraising activity showed. KKR & Co raised $683 million for two funds, including one that will invest across private equity, growth equity, real assets as well as special situations hedge funds and private credit funds, the document showed. The new funds are all listed on the Mexican Stock Exchange. Mexico is attractive to those looking to raise assets for long-term investment. The country has the largest and one of the fastest-growing private pension fund systems in Latin America, almost doubling in size in seven years, a global pension fund assets analysis by consultancy Willis Towers Watson found. Mexican pension funds’ investment outside the country is still limited to 20 percent of overall assets while their investment in alternatives like private equity is also limited to 20 percent. This gives them little room for diversification at a time when most other maturing pension fund systems are loosening investment restrictions to help address problems like funding gaps and an ageing population. Investing in new asset classes or geographies adds layers of complexity. This often requires more sophisticated investment processes, risk management and corporate governance practices. Tonatiuh Rodriguez, chief executive at one of Mexico’s leading pension funds, Afore Azteca, said its investment committee had decided not to invest in private equity for now. “The risk of these investments is a risk that needs to be monitored and managed in a different way,” Rodriguez said. “The returns we get from investments in the public market, which, by definition, is more regulated, are good.” Regulation stipulates that the private equity managers need to invest at least 10 percent of the capital in Mexico and commit at least 2 percent as co-investment alongside the pension funds. Despite his risk aversion, Rodriguez said: “The fact that those are large, well-known managers, with best practices, minimizes the risks for pension funds.” (Reporting by Stefanie Eschenbacher; additional reporting by Joshua Franklin in New York; editing by Frank Jack Daniel and Cynthia Osterman)"

0.11519539674034536," BlackRock makes case to own more U.S. TIPS NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager, on Monday recommended investors hold more U.S. Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) as the Federal Reserve is expected to refrain from raising short-term interest rates in the coming months. The U.S. central bank also signaled it is open to allowing inflation to rise above its 2 percent goal to compensate for years that it has missed that desired target level, the company’s global chief investment strategist Richard Turnill said. “The Fed has confirmed its intent to be patient with its next rate move and may let inflation temporarily breach its 2 percent target,” Turnill wrote in a research note. “Along with a slowing but growing economy, we believe this makes TIPS an attractive alternative to nominal bonds.” So far in 2019, TIPS have produced a total return of 1.08 percent, compared with a 0.06 percent loss among regular Treasury bonds, according to indexes compiled by Bloomberg and Barclays. Inflation expectations, as measured by the difference between the yields of TIPS and regular Treasuries known as breakeven rate, have recovered from their dramatic drop in late 2018, as investors lost confidence about the economy due to trade tensions between China and the United States. Investors had also grown worries about further rate hikes from the Fed before policy-makers took a dovish shift at their policy meeting in late January. The 10-year TIPS breakeven rate fell to 1.69 percent at the start of the year before touching 1.96 percent last Friday, which was its highest level in nearly three months, Tradeweb data showed. To be sure, TIPS would lose their relative attractiveness to regular Treasuries if the U.S. economy slips into a recession and the Federal Reserve were to begin cutting interest rates, which Turnill said were unlikely to happen in 2019. Investors have shifted $430 million back into TIPS-focused funds so far this year after withdrawing some $4.8 billion from them in the final quarter of 2018, according to data firm Lipper. “We see potential for TIPS to play a valuable role in portfolios in the near term,” Turnill wrote."
0.03260917187118171," UAE's ADNOC seals $4 billion pipeline infrastructure deal with KKR, BlackRock ABU DHABI (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) has sealed a $4 billion midstream pipeline infrastructure deal with U.S. investment firms KKR and BlackRock, the government-owned company said on Sunday. ADNOC has been expanding through strategic partnerships since 2017. Last month it won a combined $5.8 billion investment from Italy’s Eni and Austria’s OMV for a stake in its refining business to establish a new trading operation owned by the three partners. The latest deal follows ADNOC’s capital markets debut with its Abu Dhabi Crude Oil Pipeline bond, the IPO of ADNOC Distribution and other initiatives. A new entity called ADNOC Oil Pipelines will lease the oil company’s interest in 18 pipelines, transporting crude oil and condensates across ADNOC’s upstream concessions for a 23-year period, ADNOC said in a statement. The 18 pipelines have a total length of over 750 km and capacity of 13 million barrels per day. Funds managed by KKR and BlackRock will form a consortium to hold a 40 percent stake in the entity, with ADNOC owning the rest. ADNOC will have sovereignty over the pipelines and management of pipeline operations. The deal, expected to close in the third quarter of 2019, will result in upfront proceeds of some $4 billion to ADNOC. The statement cited Sultan al-Jaber, ADNOC group CEO, as saying the deal validated ADNOC’s approach of “unlocking value from its portfolio of assets while retaining control over their ownership and operation”. BlackRock is investing through its Global Energy & Power Infrastructure Fund series while KKR’s investment is through its third Global Infrastructure Investors Fund, the statement said. “We believe that today’s agreement among ADNOC, BlackRock and KKR will be followed by many more such partnerships to invest in the future growth of the region,” said BlackRock CEO Laurence Fink. This is KKR’s first direct investment in the region, co-CEO Henry Kravis said, adding that there is substantial potential for more. ADNOC has undergone major changes since al-Jaber’s appointment in 2016, embarking on privatization, oil trading and expanded partnerships with strategic investors. “I think the approach taken here by ADNOC reflects a desire to monetize assets they have under their control,” said Edward Bell, director of commodities research at Emirates NBD. “So I think it reflects an attempt to realize the value of the infrastructure they have in place more than a strategic shift into midstream oil and gas.” ADNOC produces about 3 million barrels of oil and 10.5 billion cubic feet of raw gas a day."

4.373963625357424," BlackRock hires former Fed official Fischer as an adviser: memo (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc is hiring former U.S. Federal Reserve Vice Chair Stanley Fischer as a senior adviser, the world’s largest fund manager said in a memo on Wednesday. Over his career Fischer helped to shape modern economic theory as an academic, trained many future policymakers and put his ideas into practice in a series of jobs culminating in roles at the center of the response to the 2008 global financial crisis. Fischer, who was born in Zambia, served as governor of the Bank of Israel from 2005 to 2013 before joining the Fed, where he was vice chair for 3-1/2 years until October 2017. New York-based BlackRock, which manages about $6 trillion in assets, said Fischer would be a senior adviser within the BlackRock Investment Institute, an arm of the company that serves as a think tank on investment strategy, according to the memo co-signed by Chief Executive Larry Fink and confirmed by a company spokeswoman. The memo said Fischer will add to the company’s research, support its investment teams and speak with clients on markets, economics and central bank policy. During his time at the Fed, as memories of the financial crisis faded, monetary policymakers continued to wrestle with how to undo their historic stimulus efforts at that time without sending the economy into another tailspin. As some of his colleagues began wondering about a permanent downshift in global inflation and interest rates, Fischer maintained an underlying faith in the macroeconomic models - which he helped refine - that showed falling unemployment ultimately raising inflation and requiring higher interest rates in response.

Will Landers, who left BlackRock in January, will join BTG Pactual as a partner, starting March 18, replacing José Zitelmann, who it said is leaving “to pursue other professional projects.” São Paulo-based analysts Andrea Cardia and Andrea Weinberg, who left BlackRock together with Landers, will also join the company. Landers oversaw $2 billion in assets. BTG Pactual Asset Management’s Chief Operations Officer Allan Hadid said in an interview on Monday that in addition to overseeing all of its equity funds, Landers will directly manage a fund dedicated to Latin America assets. Although the company has portfolio managers in Brazil, Chile and Mexico, it does not currently offer clients an equity fund with a Latin America-wide strategy. “We believe that Latin America is in a favorable moment in terms of growth prospects for a focused fund,” Hadid said. The fund will be open to investments in April, he said, declining to give a target for assets under management. BTG Pactual’s asset management unit has 184 billion reais ($49.28 billion) under management. Roughly 9.5 billion reais is in equity funds, according to fund industry association Anbima. The Landers hiring underscores how BTG Pactual is regaining steam after a Brazilian federal judge acquitted its founder Andre Esteves of corruption charges in July. Esteves stepped back from his management role and the bank was forced to cut jobs and shed assets. Its shares hit a nearly two-year high on Friday. ($1 = 3.7338 reais)"

13.597623861926895," U.S. court throws out BlackRock fund fees lawsuit (Reuters) - A U.S. federal court on Friday dismissed a lawsuit against BlackRock Inc that had accused the world’s largest fund manager of charging too much in investment advisory fees, according to a preliminary order. Investors in the BlackRock Global Allocation Fund and the BlackRock Equity Dividend Fund had filed suit in 2014 alleging the fund manager charged fees substantially in excess of those charged by other similar funds. Judge Freda Wolfson of U.S. District Court in Trenton, New Jersey, ordered that the full ruling be sealed for 30 days until the parties could make a submission to redact portions of the order. In the preliminary ruling the judge “ordered that Plaintiffs’ claims are dismissed in their entirety.” BlackRock declined to comment."
14.951601822917413," Exclusive: Fed could raise rates as much as twice this year - BlackRock's Rieder NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve wants to raise interest rates one to two more times this year and will do so if inflation gathers steam, BlackRock Inc’s Rick Rieder told Reuters this week. Rieder, who is chief investment officer of global fixed income for the world’s largest fund manager, said markets expect the Fed’s next move on rates will be to cut them. Many investors are predicting a recession by 2020 with limited basis for such a claim, he said in a phone interview on Monday afternoon. “The Fed would still like to get a hike or two done,” according to Rieder. “The markets’ interpretation is a bit extreme.” Rieder’s views about the Fed and financial markets are widely followed. BlackRock firm managed $5.98 trillion as of the end of 2018, with a third of that in bonds. He also sits on the New York Fed’s Investor Advisory Committee on Financial Markets. In a sharp reversal of his stance in December, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said last week that the Fed has “the luxury of patience” in deciding whether to raise rates again. Futures tied to the federal funds rate are currently pricing in a 13 percent chance of one or more cuts by next January, compared to a nearly 8 percent chance of hikes. Traders assign an overwhelming probability that the Fed’s target range will remain 2.25 percent to 2.5 percent. Rieder has argued since October that the Fed could, should and would pause rate hikes given tame inflation. At the time the view was not common. Yet the second half of the year often delivers stronger economic data and could open a window for further hikes in time for the Fed’s policy meetings in June, September or December, Rieder said. The Fed is shrinking its cache of bonds bought after the 2008 financial crisis to spur lending and investment, and central bankers signaled last week that the asset-shedding operation could end sooner than previously thought. The Fed’s balance sheet is down to $4.1 trillion from a peak of $4.5 trillion. Rieder said the Fed should move to end its reduction of bonds. “While $4 trillion sounds like a very big number, the U.S. economy is a very big number,” said Rieder, given a U.S. economy around $20 trillion in annual gross domestic product. “They can run a bigger balance sheet and give themselves some flexibility.” Rieder said he has been buying longer-term bonds, emerging-market debt denominated in local currencies and U.S. investment grade credit. But he said he is avoiding leveraged loans given weaker investor protections, a lower likelihood of rising rates that would boost the loans’ value and the possibility that issuers will not pay on schedule."

The portfolio managers would eventually be transferred to mainland Europe to handle client accounts there once Britain and the European Union agreed a regulatory framework, they added. But neither of the firms, who together employ more than 10,000 people in London, expects a chaotic exit that would force them to carry out the emergency relocation, the sources said. A spokeswoman for BlackRock, which is the world’s biggest asset manager and manages around $6.3 trillion, declined to comment on the plan but in an emailed response to Reuters said: “BlackRock maintains extensive regulatory licenses and permissions across Europe and globally to ensure it can continue to serve its clients post-Brexit.” To avert such moves, the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) is in talks with Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) on agreements which would oversee cross-border asset activity and managers. The U.S. makes sense as a temporary base for Goldman and BlackRock as Europe has cooperation agreements with U.S. regulators, so managers could handle European clients’ accounts from there until ESMA and the FCA have theirs. “By pulling the UK out of Europe, there’s potentially a regulatory hole because the UK doesn’t have a cooperation and information sharing agreement with each EU country,” said Neil Robson, regulatory partner at law firm Katten Muchin Rosenman.

If not, BlackRock will move around 10 equity portfolio managers to New York, one source said, adding they would later move to the euro zone. Goldman’s asset management business GSAM, with 50 managers in London, has plans to send “a handful” to the U.S. financial capital until a framework is in place, the second source said, adding they too would eventually relocate to the euro zone.

13.811533772966927," Market turmoil hits BlackRock's bottom line in fourth quarter NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc BLK.N, the world's largest fund manager, reported a smaller-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday due to financial market turmoil, but investors celebrated the company's strong sales of relatively low-fee funds. Sinking performance in late 2018 led investors to pull cash from the company’s typically higher fee funds aimed at beating the market but people put record cash in the company’s generally lower-cost exchange traded funds (ETFs). Overall, the company sold $43.6 billion in stock, bond and other “long-term” investment funds, more than the $10.6 billion sold the quarter prior. Still, weaker investment performance and the company’s own price cuts hurt. The company collects fees as a percentage of assets under management, which are now just under $6 trillion. The S&P 500 .SPX fell more than 10 percent in the three months ended Dec. 31. Money that the company earned for hitting certain performance targets and for lending out shares to people betting against stocks fell from the year prior. “There are moments you can’t control what clients are doing, when clients are de-risking. We saw that in 2018, but that does not deter the conversations we’re having with our clients,” BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink told Reuters. “We’re investing more money in the future than any other asset management company.” Fink said the company continued to see opportunities to grow, including helping Chinese individuals save and selling technology services to other financial companies. People are also flocking to the company’s iShares ETFs to get cheap exposure to various parts of the market. The iShares group took in $81 billion in the quarter, compared with $34 billion in the quarter prior. BlackRock’s stock is down nearly a third from an all-time high near $600 per share last year, declining more than 21 percent in 2018. The stock rose 4.3 percent to $418 on Wednesday as a broader rally pushed U.S. stock indexes higher. Analysts seemed pleased with the average level of fees BlackRock was able to charge as well as continued success at winning new assets. “We see the silver lining,” said Edward Jones analyst Kyle Sanders. “This was a reaffirmation to investors that BlackRock is differentiated with iShares.” Net income fell to $927 million, or $5.78 per share, in the quarter, from $2.30 billion, or $14.01 per share, a year earlier, when U.S. corporate tax cuts helped. Analysts, on average, expected $6.27 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Excluding restructuring charges and other items, the company earned $6.08 per share. BlackRock sliced expenses, but not as fast as its revenues fell. The company said last week it was cutting about 500 jobs, or 3 percent of its workforce, and booked a $60 million restructuring charge in the quarter. Total staff is still expected to be higher than a year ago following the cuts. Fink told Reuters he did not expect additional “restructuring” or to make a significant asset management deal to boost growth, though he did suggest BlackRock could buy a technology company."

The job cuts are not concentrated in any one geographic region or unit, according to people familiar with the moves. BlackRock oversees $6.4 trillion in assets under management. In 2018, investors sold off asset managers’ stocks as wild-swinging markets cut funds’ returns, accelerating a stampede to lower-fee products. BlackRock’s iShares unit has a leading position in ETFs, which typically track the market and charge lower fees than products that try to beat the market.

14.410963140507418," Funds to cut equity allocations in 2019: Blackrock survey LONDON (Reuters) - Global investors are shoring up portfolios against economic downturn, with plans to cut allocation to publicly listed equities in 2019 in favor of assets such as private equity and real estate, according to the results of a BlackRock survey. Over half the 230 institutions managing $7 trillion of inevitable assets surveyed by BlackRock plan to decrease allocation to public equities this year, up from 35 percent in 2018, the survey, released on Monday, showed. Global stocks suffered their worst year in over a decade in 2018, with trepidation surrounding economic slowdown, trade tension and rising interest rates infecting the market in the second half of the year. Markets have been similarly volatile at the start of 2019. Equities appear to be especially in disfavor in the United States and Canada, with 68 percent of investors there planning to reduce allocations, versus 27 percent in continental Europe, the survey showed. Underpinning this rebalancing is concern that the economic cycle is turning, as cited by 56 percent of clients. While strong economic data in the United States and a dovish message from U.S. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell on Friday have helped to alleviate some worries, the U.S. and Canada-based investors were most concerned about rising U.S. interest rates, BlackRock said. This represented just over half of those surveyed (52 percent), while geopolitical instability and trade tensions were citied as bigger concerns by European and Asian accounts. BlackRock said private assets and fixed income are likely to be the main beneficiaries of the shift in sentiment in 2019, as investors search for uncorrelated sources of returns. As such, 54 percent of those surveyed intend to increase exposure to real assets, 47 percent planned to boost private equity allocations and 40 percent chose real estate. Flows to fixed income are expected to increase to 38 percent, from 29 percent a year earlier. Within this asset class, private credit is set to benefit -- 56 percent of those surveyed globally planned to increase allocations to the sector. Cash too will be a key part of portfolios though BlackRock highlighted regional differences.

Will Landers, the veteran portfolio manager for the company’s Latin American equity funds and head of research for the region, is leaving along with two analysts based in Sao Paulo, Brazil’s financial center, the company said in a statement. Landers oversaw an estimated $2 billion in assets, according to BlackRock’s most recent filings with U.S. regulators. Research analysts Andrea Cardia and Andrea Weinberg are also leaving to “to pursue other opportunities,” BlackRock Global Head of Active Equities Mark Wiseman and one of his colleagues said in a staff memo provided to Reuters. It was not immediately clear where the BlackRock employees will be going. Landers, Cardia and Weinberg did not respond to messages sent to social media accounts they maintain. BlackRock’s memo said that Ed Kuczma would take on some of Landers’ portfolio management responsibility duties, adding that Kuczma has more 15 years of investment experience in Latin American equities. The transition comes during a wild period for investors focused on the region, whose swing to conservative rule in places, including Brazil, has isolated leftist-ruled countries such as Venezuela, a major oil producer. Brazil’s new far-right President Jair Bolsonaro was sworn in on Tuesday. Investors are also looking for progress on economic initiatives from Mexico to Argentina. BlackRock’s memo said the company is “working actively to strengthen our resources in Latin America research and portfolio management,” and planned to increase staff dedicated to that effort. It was not clear if the company’s active equities division will still have an on-the-ground presence in Brazil, and a BlackRock spokeswoman did not comment. Global fund managers have struggled in recent years with a trend toward cheaper “passive” index-tracking products. BlackRock, which oversees $6.4 trillion in both actively managed and passive funds, announced in 2017 a strategy to bolster its own stockpickers, including reorganizing to focus on niches, such as specific geographic regions where it could offer expertise and win assets. Equity research in Sao Paulo was highlighted as part of that effort."
10.516812145885744," BlackRock and peers slash research budgets as new EU rules squeeze brokers LONDON (Reuters) - BlackRock and other investment houses have slashed their budgets for external research by as much as half after the introduction of new European Union rules, piling pressure on stockbrokers, a senior executive at the world’s top asset manager said on Tuesday. The EU’s Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II, known as MiFID II, which took effect in January, states investment research must be priced separately from other broker services to ensure transparency and better value for money. With the rules making clear how much investors are being charged for research, many asset managers are scrutinizing more than ever what they’re paying for and using less. “It’s really clear the amount being paid is 30-50 percent lower and that’s staying there,” Nigel Bolton, chief investment officer of international equities at BlackRock, told Reuters on the sidelines of a briefing on Tuesday. “A lot of people are waiting for it to get better, but I don’t think it will. Budgets are down and aren’t going to come back up.” The sweeping changes in how asset managers consume research will underscore concerns about pain being felt across European equity research providers almost a year after MiFID II came into force. Stockbrokers have been the main losers from the new legislation, Bolton said, echoing a sentiment across the financial sector. “We basically think twice before having a meeting (with a stockbroker), and we share meetings,” Bolton said. Verena Ross, executive director of the EU’s European Securities and Markets Authority, which is overseeing the implementation of MiFID II, said the watchdog was closely monitoring the market’s concerns about research. “The landscape is changing and that has some implications, but at the same time the evidence from the data is not particularly firm yet,” she told a conference in London. The watchdog will look, in particular, at whether there is sufficient coverage of small-cap companies, she said. The cuts are likely to drive consolidation as small- and medium-sized brokerages struggle with the loss of research income and falling commission fees amid growing competition, experts say. The comments come after reports last month that Australia's Macquarie MQG.AX was in talks to buy boutique London-based broker, Liberum, in a bid to strengthen its UK equities business as MiFID II forces it to pay for research. German private bank Berenberg has laid off staff in its equities business amid pressure from MiFID II, the Financial Times reported last month. “We haven’t seen the mass cull I’d expected. We’ll see more mergers (in 2019),” BlackRock’s Bolton told a briefing earlier on Tuesday. He is also co-head of fundamental equities and head of the European equities team at the world’s top asset manager."
11.84848485257772," BlackRock: China stocks a better bet than UK amid Brexit chaos LONDON (Reuters) - Chinese stocks look a better bet than the United Kingdom next year, as Britain struggles with its painful divorce from the European Union, a senior executive at BlackRock, the world’s top asset manager, said on Tuesday. “China is slightly more invest-able than the UK right now,” said Nigel Bolton, chief investment officer of international equities on the sidelines of a briefing on Tuesday. The comment illustrates the depth of concern about the uncertain outcome of Brexit, with the FTSE 100 .FTSE and midcap index FTMC on track for their worst year since 2008 and sterling languishing at 20-month lows. It is also significant as Beijing remains locked in a protracted trade row with Washington, which has triggered big sell-offs in China’s volatile equity market in recent months amid worries it will hurt the world’s second-largest economy. BlackRock’s Bolton said he would wait until there is clarity around that dispute. But he pointed as positives to Beijing’s efforts to shore up its economy and expectations the government will take more aggressive action in coming months to reduce the risk of a sharper economic slowdown next year. “We think the upside is potentially bigger than the downside. We’ve been edging money back into China,” he said. In contrast, he still sees a 30 percent downside risk to domestically focused U.K. equities as Prime Minister Theresa May’s deal flounders with less than four months until the United Kingdom is due to leave the EU on March 29. The blue-chip FTSE 100, which makes 70 percent of its income outside of the UK, has fallen 11.5 percent so far this year, while the more domestically focused FTSE 250 is down 15 percent year to date. The sterling was near 20-month lows on Tuesday after May on Monday pulled a parliamentary vote because she faced defeat and a day later rushed to Europe to try and renegotiate new terms. While BlackRock doesn’t expect Britain to go through a hard Brexit, the political uncertainty will cast a cloud over the market for the foreseeable future. That may be the case for European equities too, Bolton said. “In Europe, we’re more cautious over the next year or two. The primary reason is politics, with the unknown factors of Brexit, concerns around the French government, a new policymaker in Germany and the open question of Italy,” he said. “International investors will remain on the sidelines. I don’t see them returning until there is clarity.” The asset manager’s top pick is U.S. equities based on expected earnings growth of 9 percent - compared with 5-6 percent in Europe - and the pace of share buybacks of some $800 billion, Bolton said."

8.219850351345197," BlackRock's Rieder buying longer-term bonds as Fed pause seems likely NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc's BLK.N Rick Rieder is buying longer-term bonds because softening inflation could force the U.S. Federal Reserve to pause interest rate hikes, the top fixed-income investor told Reuters this week. Rieder, who is chief investment officer of global fixed income for the world’s largest fund manager, said inflation could be declining from current levels. “People keep waiting for the bogeyman coming in terms of inflation, and they’re going to have to wait a long time,” Rieder said on Wednesday. “Why not pause?” BlackRock manages $6.4 trillion in assets, with nearly a third of that in fixed income. Over the past three weeks, Rieder has been buying longer-term bonds, particularly Treasuries coming due in 5 years, but also those due as far in the future as 30 years. Earlier this year, Rieder had been selling long bonds, citing uncertainty around Fed policy. Now, he says, the picture is clearer. Markets, bracing for an economic slowdown possible by 2020, are pushing back against three years of Fed rate hikes aimed at restoring policy to normal footing a decade after the 2007-2009 global financial crisis. Strong buying pushed 30-year U.S. yields US30YT=RR to 3.12 percent on Thursday, from highs this month above 3.3. The benchmark S&P 500 .SPX stock index is down 2.2 percent over the same period, including dividends. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Nov. 28 policy rates are “just below” estimates of a level that neither brakes nor boosts a healthy U.S. economy. Markets assign an overwhelming probability that there will be two hikes at most between now and the end of 2019. Rieder in September predicted the Fed would raise rates only twice or so in 2019. At the time markets priced in a better-than-even chance that the Fed would move three times or more. Investors await a U.S. jobs report on Friday that will shed light on wage inflation. But inflation is unlikely, Rieder said, as consumers fail to purchase big-ticket items. Housing and other interest rate-sensitive sectors, meanwhile, are reeling from rate hikes. The Fed is also shrinking its cache of bonds bought after the financial crisis to spur lending and investment. Partly as a result of that, global market liquidity is set to shrink compared to the prior year for the first time since the crisis, BlackRock estimates show. Indeed, investors should expect more volatility, Rieder said. “People are underestimating the amount of liquidity that’s being drained from the system.”"
1.341699279898666," Moelis hires from BlackRock, hedge fund for activist defense team (Reuters) - Investment bank Moelis & Co said on Monday it has hired an executive from the world’s largest index fund manager, BlackRock Inc, as well as a hedge fund professional, for its team advising companies facing activist shareholders. Ted Moon, who had been a principal at Will Mesdag’s hedge fund Red Mountain Capital Partners, recently joined Moelis as an executive director in its Los Angeles office, the bank confirmed on Monday. Moelis said it also hired Peter da Silva Vint, a former vice president in BlackRock’s investment stewardship unit, as an executive director at the firm’s New York office. He starts on Monday. “We are excited about the combination of them because they will allow us to provide more insightful advice to our clients in noncontested situations and advise them on how to interact and think about their shareholders and where their mindsets are,” Craig Wadler, a managing director who heads Moelis’ shareholder defense practice, said in an interview. Moelis, which has advised activist investors in the past, does not work with activists anymore, following other banks seeking to avoid the appearance of a conflict of interest. The Moelis hires come as investors, including many hedge funds, are prodding corporations to shake up their businesses by spinning off units, buying back their own stock and sometimes overhauling management and boards of directors. To defend against hedge funds such as Trian Fund Management and Third Point LLC, investment banks have been adding to their defense teams to offer corporate America more expertise on how to evaluate governance, executive compensation and other issues where they may be vulnerable. Wadler said Moon and da Silva Vint have “real experience” in what activist hedge funds want to see done and how big index funds, which now make up the bulk of shareholders at many companies, think when it comes to voting as shareholders. Other firms have also been seeking to get more into shareholder activist defending. In early November, financial public relations firm ICR launched a business to advise corporate boards and hired Lyndon Park, who previously headed global corporate governance at Dimensional Fund Advisors. PJT Partners Inc, run by veteran investment banker Paul Taubman, in August paid $165 million to acquire shareholder advisory firm CamberView Partners, which companies often use to get a better sense of their shareholder base."
6.078856217616871," MOVES-BlackRock names new chief in Asia as it prepares China ramp-up NEW YORK, Nov 25 (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc on Sunday appointed its New York-based corporate strategy chief as head of its operations in the Asia Pacific region as the world’s largest fund manager looks to ramp up its operations in China. Geraldine Buckingham, a former Rhodes scholar and McKinsey & Co partner who currently directs the asset manager’s corporate strategy globally, will move from New York to Hong Kong to take on the role, BlackRock said in a statement. The fund manager oversees $6.4 trillion in assets. The move comes as BlackRock puts in play plans that Buckingham helped develop to grow its business in China, which has historically been restricted and small in comparison with its operations in the United States and Europe. The Asia Pacific region accounts for 7 percent of the company’s assets under management. Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink described developing its China business as one of the company’s most critical priorities in the company’s annual report earlier this year and added that Chinese regulations allowing foreign asset managers to eventually own 100 percent of a domestic fund management company could allow BlackRock to significantly expand its presence. Buckingham’s predecessor in the Asia role, Ryan Stork, will return to New York as BlackRock’s deputy global chief operating officer, with input on the company’s technology strategy. The two management changes take effect in February. Buckingham’s successor in the strategy role and a new job for deputy global chief operating officer Patrick Olson will also be announced in February, a BlackRock spokeswoman said in an email.

5.7544284370366325," Oil majors spending 'sweet spot' to last to 2020: BlackRock LONDON (Reuters) - Big Oil is today in a spending sweet spot as years of cost cuts and rising oil prices converge but investments will need to rise after 2020 to boost output, BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, said on Tuesday. Oil and gas giants such as Royal Dutch Shell RDSa.AS, Chevron CVX.N and BP BP.L are generating as much cash at today's oil prices of around $70 a barrel as they did in 2014, before crude spiraled down from over $100 a barrel to lows of below $30 a barrel. As they emerge from the deepest downturn in decades, boards have vowed to remain thrifty and stick to lower spending targets in order to return value to shareholders after years of pain. Alastair Bishop, director and portfolio manager in BlackRock’s natural resources team, which has major holdings in the world’s five largest oil and gas companies, said he did not expect capital expenditure, or capex, to rise in the near term. “It is a sweet spot for IOCs (international oil companies) where they have relatively low cost inflation, a reasonable oil price and at these levels they can generate significant cashflow to go toward paying down debt (and share) buybacks,” Bishop told Reuters in an interview. BlackRock is the largest investor in Shell and BP and among the top five in Total TOTF.PA, Exxon XOM.N and Chevron, Eikon Refinitiv data shows. Unlike earlier in the decade, when oil companies raced to grow production to meet soaring demand in China, boards are today focused on returns from investments, Bishop said. “I am not sure investors are wanting large IOCs to be chasing growth. There is much greater interest in generating returns and free cash flow.” But given the nature of the business where fields naturally decline as they age and take years to develop, investments will have to grow after 2020 to avoid a dip in production. “Would I be surprised if beyond 2020 capex budgets start to move higher? No, I wouldn’t. There will be a little cost inflation and they will need to start thinking about their production profile into the 2020s,” Bishop said. The appetite for huge multi-billion-dollar projects such as deepwater oil fields and large gas processing facilities that became the trademark for Big Oil has however weakened, Bishop said. Instead, companies should opt for smaller-scale and phased projects where spending is better controlled such as shale oil and offshore field expansions as well as non-oil and gas projects such as chemical plants and power generation, he added. “There seems to be less appetite for just ploughing money straight back into the ground,” according to Bishop. “From our side, unless you have new opportunities right at the bottom of the cost curve we are not that desperate for you to drive volume growth in terms of oil.” GRAPHIC: Big Oil cashflow - tmsnrt.rs/2Pn84xn BlackRock sees the transition away from fossil fuels to cleaner low-carbon energy happening faster than many oil companies expect, with oil demand peaking in the early 2030s, Bishop said, around a decade earlier than most other forecasts. But what role oil majors will play in the transition remains unclear. Europe’s energy giants have stepped up investments in low-carbon energies following the landmark U.N.-backed 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, in contrast with their U.S. rivals. “Levels the Europeans are spending in that area look entirely reasonable to me,” Bishop said. “If they can prove the business model works then it would make sense for them to start allocating more.”"
-1.5345078526950413," German prosecutors search BlackRock in sham trades inquiry FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German state prosecutors confirmed they searched the Munich offices of investor BlackRock as part of a probe into an illicit tax trading scheme but exonerated the company’s local chairman, who is vying to succeed Chancellor Angela Merkel. The prosecutors are investigating a fraud known as cum-ex that typically involved trading company shares rapidly around a syndicate of banks, investors and hedge funds to create the impression of numerous owners, each entitled to a tax rebate. On Tuesday, they searched the Munich offices of BlackRock, prompting the globe’s biggest investor to say that it was fully cooperating with the probe of cum-ex transactions between 2007-2011. The search has prompted wide national interest in Germany because Friedrich Merz, a potential successor to Merkel, has held the post of BlackRock’s chairman in Germany since 2016. Merz, who was not there at the time of the trades that are being investigated, said he had ordered the fund’s management board to investigate all incidents involving such cum-ex deals. “Everything will be investigated and we will actively participate in that,” he said at a political event in the northwestern German city of Duesseldorf on Tuesday. Confirming the search, Cologne prosecutors said on Wednesday that Merz was not suspected of wrongdoing. Merz has taken an early lead in the race to succeed Merkel as leader of Germany’s Christian Democrats and secure the chance of running for chancellor, possibly as soon as next year. Gerhard Schick, a Greens party member of Germany’s parliament, said the case raised the question as to whether Merz had responded promptly enough."

1.7037703526258003," BlackRock's Fink says U.S., China on path to full-fledged trade war NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc Chief Executive Larry Fink said on Thursday the United States is on a path to a full-fledged trade war against China as the world’s two largest economies engage in tit-for-tat tariffs. Fink is one of the most influential figures in global finance, who keeps up relations with politicians in many countries as leader of the world’s largest fund manager, overseeing $6.4 trillion in assets from sovereign debt to corporate equity. “If the path remains the same in the next few weeks, we’re going to have a full-fledged trade war,” Fink said at the New York Times Co’s DealBook conference. “China is a very strong, very proud nation. I think they’re going to stand pretty firm.” The United States has imposed tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, and China has responded with retaliatory duties on $110 billion worth of U.S. goods. U.S. President Donald Trump has long threatened to impose tariffs on all remaining Chinese imports into the United States if Beijing fails to meet U.S. demands for sweeping changes to Chinese trade, technology transfer and industrial subsidy policies. In a tweet on Thursday Trump said he had a “very good” talk with Chinese President Xi Jinping on trade and North Korea and that the two planned to meet at the G20 summit in Argentina which starts at the end of this month. Fink said he had traveled to China in recent weeks and defined a “full-fledged trade war” as meaning U.S. levies on all Chinese imports. He said China will likely not buy more U.S. Treasuries as the trade war goes on. That would put pressure on Washington, which has financed its growing debt by selling bonds, often to China and other foreign governments. Just days after a gunman killed 11 people at a Pittsburgh synagogue, Fink said his company has privately engaged with gun makers on how they plan to respond to the social backlash from mass shootings. BlackRock is the largest shareholder in several gun makers through its massive index funds, which generally hold shares in all companies in a certain index. Fink in January wrote a letter to corporate executives saying that companies need to show how they make “a positive contribution to society” in addition to delivering financial performance, as his company faces such demands from shareholders and customers."

BlackRock is the largest shareholder in several gun makers through its massive index funds, which generally hold shares in all companies in a certain index. Fink in January wrote a letter to corporate executives saying that companies need to show how they make “a positive contribution to society” in addition to delivering financial performance, as his company faces such demands from shareholders and customers.

5.3968267468662985," BlackRock-owned Mexican prison opens in Coahuila MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A federal prison in northern Mexico owned by BlackRock Inc BLK.N has gone into operation, the government said, as the world's largest asset manager expands further into infrastructure investment around the world. A spokeswoman for prison agency OADPRS said that inmates began to arrive in August at the facility, known as CPS Coahuila, and that there were 139 people there by the end of that month. OADPRS declined to answer further questions. Security at the prison is the responsibility of the Mexican government, while a BlackRock subsidiary runs operations such as food and maintenance. The contract to build and maintain the prison was first awarded almost eight years ago to a different company. BlackRock took over the project in 2016, after the Mexican government made changes to the prison and raised the promised annual payments to its operator to pay for them. BlackRock will receive annual payments of at least 1.281 billion pesos ($65.5 million) a year for 20 years to cover construction, food and other maintenance, according to documents obtained by Reuters via a freedom of information request and a report by congressional auditor ASF. Neither the government nor BlackRock would confirm the new sum, which was calculated by Reuters. In recent years, the asset manager has pushed deeper into infrastructure investment, mostly assets like toll roads, wind power and pipelines. BlackRock said in a statement through a spokeswoman that any returns from the project would go to Mexican clients. “BlackRock has been working with the government to effectively and efficiently complete the Coahuila facility, which is now operational,” the statement said. The penitentiary is the last to open of eight semi-private prisons contracted out by former Mexican President Felipe Calderon to helped reduce chronic overcrowding. His program was criticized by civil society watchdogs. Mexico’s prison population has fallen since a new justice system was introduced in 2016, as fewer crimes merit automatic pre-trial detention. Experts said cases are also falling apart under a higher bar for police conduct and standards of evidence. OADPRS, which has had six different leaders under President Enrique Pena Nieto, originally gave the CPS Coahuila contract to Mexican construction firm Grupo Tradeco in December 2010."
8.196586866813519," BlackRock talks on Intesa asset management tie-up cool but not off: sources MILAN (Reuters) - Talks between BlackRock BLK.N and Intesa Sanpaolo ISP.MI over an asset management tie-up have slowed due to political uncertainty, but the deal is not yet off, two sources familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. BlackRock has been in talks with Intesa for more than a year to buy a minority stake in asset management unit Eurizon in a deal that would give it access to the Italian lender’s distribution network. A tie-up with a global asset manager could open the way for Intesa to make other accords with smaller or same-size partners. The talks, which have stalled several times, accelerated in the second quarter, culminating in a meeting of the two sides at the end of September, one of the sources said. “Since then it’s all slowed down because the political situation has had an impact on banking valuations, complicating matters,” the source said. A spokesman for Intesa said reports of a difference of opinion with BlackRock over Eurizon valuations were groundless. BlackRock declined comment. The idea had been for BlackRock to take a stake of between 5 and 10 percent, the source said, adding: “But there is still a willingness from both sides to continue with talks”. Italian banking shares .FTIT8300 have lost some 37 percent since mid-May when the new populist government's expansionary spending plans first spooked markets. On Tuesday the European Commission rejected Italy’s draft 2019 budget. Domestic government bonds account for 10 percent of Italian banks’ total assets, making them vulnerable to a rise in Rome’s debt costs under the anti-austerity government. “Intesa is not in the same negotiating position that it was before summer,” a second source said.

2.016479018028265," Tough markets hit BlackRock results; shares slump 4 percent (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc's BLK.N quarterly revenue fell short of Wall Street's expectations on Tuesday as the world's biggest asset manager reported its lowest sales of equity, bond and other long-term investments since the second quarter of 2016. Investors pulled money from BlackRock’s institutional stock index funds, while putting more into ostensibly lower-risk bond funds and continuing to flock to its booming iShares exchange-traded funds (ETFs) business as a low-cost way to access the market. “It was a tough quarter for the entire industry,” BlackRock Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink told Reuters. BlackRock shares were down 4 percent in trading on Tuesday morning. Overall, the company’s closely-watched earnings per share figure continue to grow, helped by lower taxes and beating analyst forecasts. But another measure, earnings before interest and taxes, fell short of forecasts. Edward D Jones & Co LP analyst Kyle Sanders called the results “disappointing.” ""All these asset managers have just been getting clobbered the last couple of months, and today's results aren't going to alleviate any of those concerns,"" he said. Shares of global asset managers tracked by Thomson Reuters .TRXFLDGLPUINVM are down 18.3 percent this year. BlackRock's publicly-traded competitors include State Street Corp STT.N, T. Rowe Price Group Inc TROW.O and Franklin Resources Inc BEN.N. All three were up about 1 percent Tuesday. Sanders said the withdrawal of institutional money from the stock market is being interpreted as particularly concerning not just for BlackRock but for markets generally. Investors pulled $30.8 billion from BlackRock’s institutional equity index accounts, which BlackRock attributed to investors cutting risk. “That’s the smart money,” said Sanders. “That’s what everyone looks to, and when people see that head to the sidelines, they’re going to read that as more challenges to come.” Markets grew anxious during the quarter about escalating U.S.-China trade disputes, U.S. Federal Reserve policy holding back economic growth, and a rout in emerging market currencies from Turkey to Argentina and India. Revenue of $3.6 billion at BlackRock was nearly 2 percent short of analyst forecasts, and earnings before interest and taxes of $1.4 billion fell about 5 percent short. BlackRock’s total net flows were down $3.1 billion and “long-term” flows, excluding accounts where investors hold cash, were up by $10.6 billion, the lowest figure in nine quarters. The results reflected increased investor preference for low-cost ETFs that own broad swathes of the market and make it easier to move in and out of the market. That ETF business is one in which BlackRock is, along with a very small group of competitors, dominant. The company makes most of its money by charging a percentage of the value of the assets it manages. The company’s iShares-brand ETFs took in $33.67 billion in new money, down from $52.31 billion, a year earlier. Meanwhile, revenue from technology services, a growing area of emphasis for the company, grew 18 percent year-over-year. In an interview, Fink touted recent wins with clients, including increasing the number of ETFs available without trading commissions through Fidelity Investments as well as Lloyds Banking Group LLOY.L, awarding the company a near-$40 billion slice of one of Europe's biggest investment contracts to be invested using various BlackRock index strategies. Net income attributable to the company rose to $1.22 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 from $944 million a year earlier. On a per share basis and excluding nonrecurring items, charges that do not affect the company’s book value and tax items that do not impact cash flow, BlackRock earned $7.54, compared with $5.76 a year earlier."
2.016479018028265," BlackRock's Fink says will not cut ties with Saudi Arabia (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink said on Tuesday that he would not cut ties with Saudi Arabia even as pressure mounts on the country to explain the disappearance of a prominent critic. Fink is one of several top business executives, including JPMorgan Chase & Co’s Jamie Dimon and HSBC Holdings plc CEO John Flint, who pulled out of a major investment conference in Riyadh after Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist who has been critical of the country’s policies, went missing. Khashoggi, a U.S. resident, vanished after entering the consulate. Turkish officials say they believe he was murdered there and his body removed, which the Saudis strongly deny. Asked on CNBC if he would cut off all business ties with Saudi Arabia if it became clear that King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud or Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had ordered Khashoggi’s murder, Fink said, “No.” BlackRock, the world’s largest fund manager with oversight of more than $6.4 trillion in assets, is widely followed by investors and economists for its influence at many of the world’s public companies and it also has a foothold with governments around the globe. Fink has long had relationships with Saudi officials and one year ago announced plans to open offices within the country. Relationships with the business and investment community are essential to the country’s Vision 2030 push to diversify the economy away from oil. The plan has grabbed attention for its big-ticket initiatives, such as a $500 billion business zone and a plan, now shelved, to sell part of the state oil firm. But the journalist’s disappearance on Oct. 2 created a complex calculus for BlackRock, whose chief executive has worked to present it as socially conscious. In a letter to top corporate executives earlier this year, Fink wrote that to “prosper over time, every company must not only deliver financial performance, but also show how it makes a positive contribution to society.” Fink told CNBC he wanted the conference delayed until the end of an investigation into the journalist’s disappearance but that he had not been successful. At that point, he said, he had only one choice and that was to withdraw. “We needed to be thoughtful and mindful how to navigate this,” Fink said. “I wanted to preserve the relationships that we’d worked so long for.”"

Pressure has mounted on Saudi Arabia since prominent Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, a Washington Post columnist who has been critical of Saudi policies, went missing. Fink said he wanted the conference delayed until the end of an investigation into the journalist’s disappearance.

-6.247263962279447," Britain's Lloyds awards $40 billion investment contract to BlackRock LONDON (Reuters) - Lloyds Banking Group LLOY.L has awarded BlackRock BLK.N a 30 billion pound ($40 billion) slice of one of Europe's biggest investment contracts to be invested using the U.S. company's various index strategies. The award to the world's biggest asset manager follows a high-profile bidding competition kick-started early this year after Lloyds said it was yanking 109 billion pounds in assets from current manager Standard Life Aberdeen SLA.L. That surprise move followed the 11 billion pound merger of original manager Aberdeen Asset Management and insurer Standard Life, which Lloyds said made the combined company a material competitor - a charge SLA is currently fighting. Lloyds on Friday said that it would also look to agree a strategic partnership with BlackRock to collaborate in alternative asset classes, risk management and investment technology. “BlackRock has been selected following a competitive tender process in which it clearly demonstrated its global market-leading capabilities and deep expertise in the UK market,” Antonio Lorenzo, chief executive of Scottish Widows and group director of insurance & wealth, said in a statement. Lloyds-owned Scottish Widows and Lloyds’ wealth management division contributed assets to the 109 billion pound mandate with SLA. “The partnership will ensure that Scottish Widows and the group can deliver good investment outcomes for its customers over the coming years,” Lorenzo added. Lloyds said the BlackRock deal would begin after an arbitration process over the SLA contract termination concludes or when the existing contract expires, adding that it is confident in its right to end the SLA deal. SLA, which is seeking 250 million pounds in compensation, declined to comment. Lloyds said that, after a review by Scottish Widows and Lloyds’ wealth unit of their asset management arrangements, it is also near to announcing plans for the remaining 80 billion pounds in assets and would update the market in due course. Lloyds has been using the mandate transfer to leverage partnerships with asset managers towards the aim of growing its presence in the insurance and wealth sector - an ambition that formed a key pillar of its most recent three-year strategy, laid out in February. Already holding a top share of its core banking markets, a push into other sectors offers Lloyds an opportunity for growth it has exhausted in products such as mortgages. On Monday it confirmed it was in talks with Schroders SDR.L, one of Britain's biggest listed asset managers, over a potential deal that would could be one of the biggest in wealth management tie-ups in recent years.

And they have used that cash to buy back their stocks and raise dividends,” Kapito told reporters in Tokyo. The co-founder of the world’s largest asset manager, with $6.3 trillion in assets under management, added that the drying up of the IPO market is another factor contributing to a shortage of shares. Fewer shares to buy “drives prices high’, he said. Asked how long he thinks the rally can last, Kapito told Reuters “Quite a long time - beyond next year. I’m very optimistic.” Major U.S. stock indices hit record highs in recent weeks are hovering not far from those levels despite worries about trade wars.

The Fed has been raising rates to stave off inflation and end its historic measures to counter the 2007-2009 global financial crisis. Rieder, however, said the Fed could be constrained in tightening monetary policy by trade conflicts, global economic conditions and trends in technology that have tamped down on factors that would otherwise push inflation higher. “So, in our view, the Fed will probably only tighten a couple of times, or so, next year, versus the consensus expectation of three or four hikes in 2019, which we think could be excessive,” he said.

-23.11491297853667," BlackRock's Fink: U.S. a short-term 'big winner' in China trade war NEW YORK (Reuters) - Larry Fink, chief executive of BlackRock BLK.N, the world's largest asset manager, on Thursday said the United States is ""a big winner"" in the trade war with China ""in the short-term,"" but not necessarily over time. Fink, speaking at Yahoo Finance’s second annual “All Markets Summit,” said the United States is currently the dominant force in the trade war because U.S. companies are benefiting from the strong dollar. That has driven U.S. stocks up, while equities have fallen elsewhere. In the long term, however, trade tensions will hurt the United States as they are leading more non-American companies to expand their business ties with China, Fink said. Still, Fink said he did not expect China’s renminbi to become a global currency of choice anytime soon, even though U.S. President Donald Trump’s protectionist policies may benefit China in the long-term. Fink also said he is worried about U.S. unilateralism. “The world is probably economically less safe.” BlackRock’s $6.3 trillion assets under management make the New York-based firm one of the most influential voices on investing worldwide. Fink was the first speaker at the event, addressing a group that included investors and executives. Fink also said that for U.S. companies to be successful in coming years, they must consider their position on social and political issues. Millennial consumers and employees want to associate with brands that they believe in, he said. Companies like Nike Inc NKE.N, which recently launched an ad campaign featuring football player and black activist Colin Kaepernick, Fink said, are succeeding on that front. “More people want to associate themselves with a brand that they believe in,” Fink said. “Employees are more interested in working for a company that they believe in,” he added. As for the short term, Fink said that despite trade concerns and political instability around the world, U.S. stocks would likely continue their strong performance. “I’m not really concerned about whether we’ll see a setback. The markets have rallied since 2009,” he said. “If you look at the markets today, we see a huge increase in corporate earnings on the back of tax cuts and a rising economy.” Fink also observed that even as stock prices have risen, valuations have become more attractive for investors. “[The price/earnings multiple] is lower today than it was a year ago, so the marketplace is now discounting some of those worries,” he said. “Some people may think they’re discounting enough, but with P/E down, you could say the market is less expensive.” (This version of the story has been refiled to remove superfluous text in paragraph 5)"

Italian markets have experienced violent gyrations in recent months on fear the coalition government will embark on a spending binge that will worsen the country’s debt burden. While some of those fears have abated of late, Italian yields trade significantly higher than those of other southern European sovereigns such as Spain or Portugal. Ten-year Italian yields stand around 2.87 percent compared to 1.5 percent in Spain and 1.8 in Portugal. BlackRock’s Scott Thiel told reporters however that Italian debt “offers an attractive valuation, especially versus other peripheral markets”. “The Italian situation seems to be moving toward a more market-friendly outcome,” he said adding he had recently gone long Italy, having shifted from a short position early in the year to neutral and now long. Several top government officials have said the government would respect European Union rules on fiscal discipline during ongoing budget talks and Economy Minister Giovanni Tria is said to be holding firm on keeping the budget deficit in check. “In our opinion, the two parties are more conscious of how to implement their policies within a European mandate,” Thiel added. Thiel said he had turned more positive on the British pound, seeing its near-term direction as higher. “It does appear that the Brexit situation has become more positive,” he said, adding that a level of $1.35 was “not out of the question” should it appear that Britain would reach agreement on exiting the European Union next March with a trade deal in place. Sterling currently trades around $1.31, having rallied almost 4 percent in the past month on reports the two sides were close to reaching an agreement on Brexit. Thiel also sees the selloff in emerging markets as “overdone”. The sector has been battered this year by a strong dollar and fears of a global trade war."

BlackRock-managed funds voted for a measure requiring the chairman be an independent director, according to BlackRock’s filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday. The proposal, which was defeated, would not have affected Musk’s standing as Tesla’s chief executive officer. More than 86 million shares voted against the proposal at a shareholder meeting in June, while fewer than 17 million voted in favor, Tesla said. Some corporate governance activists call for the chairman and CEO roles to be split between two people to improve oversight, and the new filing revealed at least one major investor backed such changes at Tesla.

-10.06768774241816," BlackRock voted to replace Tesla's Musk with independent board chair NEW YORK, Aug 30 (Reuters) - Funds run by BlackRock Inc voted over Tesla Inc’s objections in favor of a shareholder proposal in June that would have required the electric carmaker to replace Elon Musk with an independent board chairman if the motion had not been defeated, a regulatory filing showed on Thursday. BlackRock-managed funds voted for a measure requiring the board chairman be an independent director, according to a BlackRock filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. More than 86 million shares voted against the proposal at a shareholder meeting in June, while fewer than 17 million voted in favor, according to Tesla. Musk serves both as Tesla’s chairman and chief executive officer. Some corporate-governance activists call for the role to be split between two people to improve oversight, and the new filing revealed at least one major investor backed such changes at Tesla. BlackRock’s role in backing the proposal was not previously reported.

-13.011245092198026," Soros Fund Management adds popular tech names, BlackRock in second quarter NEW YORK (Reuters) - Soros Fund Management LLC added Facebook Inc, Apple Inc and Twitter Inc, but trimmed stakes in Alphabet Inc and Amazon.com Inc in the quarter through June, according to a regulatory filing on Tuesday. The family office of billionaire George Soros also bought stakes in AT&T Inc, Chevron Corp and T-Mobile US Inc and divested stakes in eBay Inc, Nvidia Corp, Snap Inc and Paypal Holdings Inc. Soros Fund Management also dramatically boosted its shares in BlackRock Inc - the world’s largest asset management firm, overseeing $6 trillion - by nearly 60 percent to 12,983 total shares in the second quarter. Other notable adjustments included paring stakes in Netflix Inc, Citigroup Inc and Wells Fargo & Co, but raising its shares of Pandora Media Inc and Salesforce.com Inc. Soros Fund Management took share stakes in Facebook of 159,200 class A shares during the second quarter and 54,500 shares in Apple. A number of prominent fund managers sharply cut their holdings in Apple only weeks before it became the first publicly-traded U.S. company to be worth more than $1 trillion. Einhorn’s Greenlight Capital slashed its stake by 77 percent, while Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management unloaded 95 percent. Advisory firm Diamond Hill Capital Management cut its stake by 27 percent. Other big holders, including Sanders Capital and Adage Capital Partners, only trimmed small amounts in the second quarter. Soros also rejigged his energy holdings, raising stakes in Devon Energy Corp and Kinder Morgan Inc, while dissolving his stake in the VanEck Vectors Oil Services ETF and cutting exposure to Canadian Natural Resources Ltd and Williams Companies Inc. Quarterly disclosures of hedge fund managers’ stock holdings, in what are known as 13F filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, are one of the few public ways of learning what the managers are selling and buying. But relying on the filings to develop an investment strategy comes with some risk because the disclosures come 45 days after the end of each quarter and may not reflect current positions. Still, the filings offer a glimpse into what hedge fund managers saw as opportunities to make money on the long side. The filings do not disclose short positions, or bets that a stock will fall in price. As a result, the public filings do not always present a complete picture of a management firm’s equities holdings."

-22.556460010600887," BlackRock's Rieder halved fund's emerging market exposure NEW YORK (Reuters) - Top BlackRock Inc BLK.N bond investor Rick Rieder halved exposure in recent months to a once-major bet in his portfolios on emerging markets on concerns including that the dollar could move higher, he told Reuters on Friday. “I still would argue volatility is going to be higher, the dollar could potentially continue to grind higher,” said Rieder, BlackRock’s chief investment officer of global fixed income. “It’s just prudent to run a smaller exposure.” Rieder cut emerging markets to just 7 percent of the $35.7 billion Strategic Income Opportunities Fund BASIX.O he manages at the end of June, from 17 percent in February, according to periodic disclosures on the company's website. He said the shift down in emerging markets exposure comes as liquidity drains out of the bond markets and with the U.S. Federal Reserve and poised, he said, to stop reducing its bond holdings and to signal a move toward the end of that balance-sheet reduction policy as soon as September. The dollar .DXY has gained 3 percent this year against its major trading partners, driven by strong U.S. economic data, rising interest rates and the possibility that a trade war could cause inflationary pressures and reduce the trade deficit of the world's largest economy. The trade rift, strong dollar and other factors have conspired to make life more difficult for emerging markets from China to Turkey and Brazil. U.S. bond yields are likely to “grind” a bit higher from where they are now, Rieder said, if for no other reason than because inflation is moving higher. BlackRock is the world’s largest asset manager, overseeing $6.3 trillion in stocks, bonds and other investments. Low-fee shares of Rieder’s Strategic Income Opportunities Fund are up 1.6 percent over one year, a bit ahead of its average peer, according to Thomson Reuters’ Lipper unit."
-23.014648208495565," Satellites and blogs: BlackRock to raise game in China stock picking SHANGHAI (Reuters) - To gain an investment edge in China, BlackRock Inc BLK.N, the world's biggest asset manager, will map the country's economic landscape using satellites, parse social media to take the market's pulse and track reports in the ruling Communist Party's newspaper, the People's Daily. The innovative measures, described in internal training materials seen by Reuters, take tailor-made investment analysis to a new level in China, where the firm is raising money for its China A-Share Opportunities Private Fund 1 amid growing competition. Since Fidelity International in early 2017 became the first global asset manager to launch onshore funds in China, an increasing number of foreign money managers have won approval to launch products locally. Earlier this month, global hedge fund managers Bridgewater Associates LP and Winton Group got the regulatory green light to launch private fund products in China, a market crowded with nearly 9,000 local competitors. BlackRock’s China fund will use ‘big data’ and machine learning - a type of computer artificial intelligence - to analyze fundamentals, market sentiment and macroeconomic policies, according to materials distributed to salespeople. The firm said it had registered its first China equity fund last month, but declined to provide details of its investment strategy when asked by Reuters. While the data-scraping techniques BlackRock will deploy are increasingly prevalent in more mature markets, use of such technology to drive investment decisions is less popular in China. Some Chinese hedge fund managers questioned the likely effectiveness of such a strategy. “Whether it’s People’s Daily articles, or satellite images, or social media postings, I don’t think the data is big enough to generate profitable trading,” said Huang Can, a Shenzhen-based hedge fund manager who uses machine learning in high-frequency trading. Xu Xiaoqing, managing director of Shanghai-based hedge fund house Preston Asset Management Co, said foreign investors needed to adapt to succeed. “Foreign asset managers are not necessarily stronger than local players in terms of research and trading capabilities,” Xu said. In a bid to capture opportunities driven by fundamentals, BlackRock said it would use satellite imagery to monitor industrial activity to better predict stock performance. It would analyze Internet and blog postings to gauge the mood in a market where retail investors account for 80 percent of trading volume, it said. And to try to sense policy shifts, which can affect markets, BlackRock said it would pore over the People’s Daily, the main newspaper of the ruling Communist Party.

Cameron joins BlackRock from Stifel Financial Corp SF.N and ""has a history of building successful teams that interact"" with top corporate executives, according to the memo. With $6.29 trillion in assets under management, BlackRock is often the largest shareholder in U.S. corporations, giving it a powerful voice on their operations and board makeup. In a letter at the start of this year, BlackRock Chief Executive Larry Fink called for more communications between shareholders and companies they own, and promised “deeper, more frequent and more productive conversations.” Cameron is taking on a job that has been vacant since Zach Oleksiuk left BlackRock last October.

-18.507838805378174," BlackRock reports weaker demand for index funds, shares dip NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc BLK.N, the world's biggest asset manager, reported smaller demand for its funds on Monday as investors fled risk, overshadowing a better-than-expected quarterly profit, and its shares dipped. The company wrestled with difficult market trends during the quarter, including an industrywide slowdown in the demand for its hottest product, exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track markets. BlackRock’s iShares-branded ETFs took in $17.8 billion during the quarter, down from $34.6 billion in the first quarter. The company also cut fees on some ETFs to increase its market share. “Broadly, we’ve seen a weakness in flows this past quarter driven by investor de-risking and less investor risk appetite in the marketplace,” said Morgan Stanley analyst Michael Cyprys. Cyprys said the company’s growth is “going to have ups and downs, and this is one of the downs,” but added that investors “have an opportunity to buy in on the weakness.” BlackRock stock traded down as much as 1.8 percent before rebounding to trade down 0.2 percent. Yet even with the slower-than-usual growth in demand for the funds, which are relatively cheap to manage as they gain in size, revenue rose more than 10 percent to $2.9 billion. Net income attributable to the company rose to $1.07 billion in the second quarter, up more than 25 percent, as weaker, yet still positive, demand for index funds helped plump up margins and the company settled into a lower tax rate. Operating income, a measure of profits after some expenses including employee pay, rose 16.4 percent to $1.4 billion in the quarter from the same period in 2017. The company’s effective tax rate was 24 percent, down from more than 30 percent in the year-ago period, before a major U.S. tax cut was passed. “The most important thing we’ve been proving is the strength of our diversified business model,” which includes not just funds but also, increasingly, technology services, said Chief Executive Larry Fink in an interview. BlackRock earned $6.62 per share, compared with $5.20 a year earlier. Excluding items, it earned $6.66 per share, while analysts expected $6.55, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Strong earnings growth, particularly in the United States, was clouded during the quarter by rising tensions between America and its trading partners. Fink warned that it is unclear “where we’re going with trade,” adding that “you saw a lot of international investors pull out of the market because they’re questioning what does this all mean in regard to trade and globalization.” Fink also told Bloomberg Television that markets could fall 10 to 15 percent if tariff wars become full-blown. BlackRock ended the quarter with $6.29 trillion in assets under management, down from $6.32 trillion in the preceding quarter. Investors pulled $22 billion from the company’s stock funds and deposited $26 billion into its fixed-income products, according to the earnings release. Overall flows, excluding funds where investors park cash temporarily, were $14.50 billion, the lowest since the second quarter of 2016."
-18.507838805378174," BlackRock is evaluating cryptocurrencies, CEO Fink says NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc BLK.N Chief Executive Larry Fink on Monday said the world's largest asset manager has assembled a working group to look at blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin, but cautioned he does not see massive investor demand. “We are a big student of blockchain,” Fink said in an interview with Reuters. Adding that he doesn’t see “huge demand for cryptocurrencies,” the company has a working group studying it. Any move to invest in cryptocurrencies or to use blockchain by BlackRock would mark a pivot for the company and a major institutional endorsement for the insurgent technology. The company managed $6.3 trillion in assets as of June 30. “BlackRock exploring crypto assets comes as no surprise and is definitely a positive development for the crypto market,” said Chris Yoo, a portfolio manager at Black Square Capital Management LLC, a hedge fund focused on the crypto space. “As the largest asset manager in the world, its interest in crypto assets could be a catalyst for upward price movement and encourage other asset managers, even with more conservative strategies, to seriously explore investing in the crypto space.” Bitcoin BTC=BTSP was trading up 4.4 percent at more than $6,600 Monday on the Bitstamp exchange, its best showing in more than two weeks, after an initial report describing the working group appeared on the website Financial News late on Sunday. That is still far down from Bitcoin's all-time peak near $20,000 in late 2017. Last November, in an interview with Reuters, Fink described bitcoin specifically as a “speculative” investment that thrives because of the cryptocurrency’s anonymity. While he sounded an optimistic tone on blockchain, the technology used to record bitcoin transactions, Fink also noted the digital currency’s association with money laundering. Some asset managers have been quicker to endorse the potential role of digital currencies. For instance, Fidelity Investments, a top BlackRock competitor in the fund management space, has extensively experimented with the technology."

-16.398543694190572," BlackRock plans its largest ever alternative investment fundraiser NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc BLK.N is planning to raise $3.5 billion for investments in energy infrastructure in what is poised to be its largest alternative investment fund yet, an executive at the world's largest asset manager told Reuters. The company announced on Wednesday that it has already raised $1.5 billion for the Global Energy and Power Infrastructure Fund III. The private fund will focus on operating infrastructure, such as power plants, pipelines and wind farms, in developed markets, potentially including the United States. Mark Florian, BlackRock’s global head of its energy and power infrastructure team, said there is growing demand for new infrastructure as countries around the world shift from coal and nuclear power sources to natural gas and renewable energy. He said large utilities and global energy companies are outsourcing the management and development of infrastructure, creating an opportunity for investment organizations such as his that want to provide capital. “The needs are just getting bigger,” Florian said in a telephone interview. BlackRock, known more for its stock and bond funds, has been building up its infrastructure unit, which it started in 2011. Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink has told analysts this year that he expects so-called illiquid alternative investments, which include private equity and typically come with higher fees than its other funds, to “be one of the more significant” drivers for BlackRock’s business over the next few years. The latest fundraising comes just over a year after BlackRock closed a deal to buy First Reserve Corp’s Energy Infrastructure Funds unit, bringing over some of that company’s existing funds and employees. Overall, BlackRock manages $6.3 trillion in assets, including $41 billion on the “real assets” team that includes the energy infrastructure business."

-8.20502500222004," BlackRock expands in Paris with new hires ahead of Brexit, source says PARIS (Reuters) - BlackRock BLK.N has increased its staff in Paris and is seeking to set up an alternative investment management business there, a source close to the company said on Monday, in another sign of the French capital's increasing post-Brexit appeal. BlackRock will provide services for clients in other countries in continental Europe from the Paris office, where it has recently hired senior executives, the source said, partly confirming an earlier report published by the Financial Times. The move comes less than nine months before Britain’s departure from the European Union in March 2019. “The expansion is part of a strategy to grow in Europe and to move closer to customers and is not related to Brexit,” the source said, without saying how many positions would be created. The world’s largest asset manager is also expanding in Germany, Switzerland and Italy, she added. A charm offensive led by pro-business President Emmanuel Macron - including easing labor rules and tax cuts - might be starting to pay off, with several financial institutions making plans to beef up their Paris operations. Bank of America is looking to move more jobs than originally envisaged to its new Paris office, one of the biggest such shifts from London ahead of Brexit, sources told Reuters last month. A Reuters survey in March showed Paris had recently overtaken Frankfurt as the top location for such moves. BlackRock will drive its expansion in France, Belgium and Luxembourg from its beefed-up office in central Paris. The company has applied to the local regulator to get a license to set up the new investment management business. The Financial Times said on Monday BlackRock had chosen Paris over London to locate this new business. Unlike other banks and financial companies, the fund manager has decided not to relocate staff to Paris from London. But its European expansion will take place by expanding in locations outside Britain. The company had unveiled three top hires in the Paris office last month including Henri Chabadel, a new chief investment officer, and two regional heads of product lines."
-5.447687107846049," U.S. securities regulator unveils proposal to ease ETF approvals WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. securities regulator on Thursday voted unanimously to propose easing its rules for approving low-risk exchange-traded funds (ETFs) in what could potentially be a major win for the $3.5 trillion market. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) five-member commission voted 5-0 to propose a rule to allow companies that sell ETFs to launch plain vanilla versions without first seeking approval from the regulator. The SEC said it hopes the rule change will boost competition and innovation by lowering the barriers to entry. The rule change, subject to feedback from the industry, would apply to open-ended ETFs, a type of mutual fund that does not have restrictions on the amount of shares it can issue, which covers the vast majority of ETFs today. Dozens of ETF companies currently operate under different requirements in a complex system they say has inadvertently allowed some firms to gain a competitive advantage. ETF issuers must get SEC permission, known as exemptive relief, before selling funds under the Investment Company Act of 1940. Democratic Commissioner Rob Jackson said he reluctantly voted for the rule change due to potential risk factors to investors, while Commissioner Kara Stein, also a Democrat, emphasized the enforcement of existing oversight controls. “The rule would include many of the website disclosure requirements that are in existing orders such as disclosing the ETFs current net asset value per share, market price, and premium or discount - each as of the prior business day,” said Stein. The Investment Company Institute, a Washington-based trade group that advocates for regulated funds, including ETFs, applauded the SEC proposal. “Investors - and the asset managers who serve them - deserve a more uniform ETF regulatory framework. The time is right to codify these exemptive orders into a single rule,” the group said in a statement. Todd Rosenbluth, director of ETF & mutual fund research at CFRA Research, said the proposed rule change could “support new ETF launches, particularly tied to long-term thematic approaches, from small independent asset managers.” BlackRock Inc and Vanguard Group accounted for more than 60 percent of the record inflows of $655 billion that entered ETFs globally in 2017, according to Morningstar Inc. Melissa Garville, a BlackRock spokeswoman, said: “ETFs are driving investor progress by helping tens of millions of people generate wealth and meet retirement goals. That is why BlackRock has long supported regulation of the ETF market that enhances transparency, market quality and choice for investors. We look forward to reviewing the proposal in more detail and commenting in due course.”"
-5.447687107846049," Blackrock buys 197.4 MW wind project in Norway OSLO (Reuters) - Blackrock, the world’s largest investment company, bought a 197.4 megawatt(MW) wind farm in western Norway through one of its funds and will cover its construction cost, the firm and the project’s previous owner Zephyr both said on Thursday. Zephyr, a Norwegian wind farm developer and operator, will continue to manage the farm’s construction, which will cost about 200 million euros ($231.76 million) and is expected to be completed by the end of 2020. The project will be built on the west coast of Norway, close to the city of Floroe and aluminum maker Alcoa will buy the entire electricity produced for a period of 15 years to power its Norwegian based production plants, they said. The wind farm, called Guleslettene, will carry 47 turbines of 4.2 MW capacity from Vestas and will have an ability to produce enough electricity to power more than 40,000 houses, said Zephyr. The construction cost will be funded by Blackrock’s equity and a long-term loan from Dekabank. After the transaction, the cost of which was not disclosed, Blackrock has $5 billion of renewable energy assets under management, with 170 projects within wind and solar, it said. To date, BlackRock Renewable Power has a total invested portfolio of approximately 4.6 gigawatt (GW) of generating capacity across wind and solar projects located in Norway, Sweden, USA, Canada, Australia, Japan, Ireland, France and Britain. Zephyr AS is owned by the energy companies Vardar [BUSFYV.UL], Glitre Energi [ENRBS.UL] and Oestfold Energi [OSTFO.UL]."

BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is in talks with Intesa’s executives and is hoping to secure control of the stake in order to play a bigger role in Eurizon’s operations and its IT management, one of the sources said. “BlackRock is the natural buyer for Eurizon,” he said. “They will take a stake and use it as a Trojan horse to plug in their IT systems and control the operational side of the business.” The source said BlackRock sees the deal as a strategic stake acquisition rather than a passive investment. BlackRock and Intesa declined to comment. Being a leader in technology and integrating its global satellites onto its operating system Aladdin are key priorities for BlackRock CEO Larry Fink. The company recently pulled out of a joint venture agreement in India because it couldn’t deploy its own technology and much of its Investor Day earlier this month was focused on tech initiatives across its business. Intesa has been working with UBS to review strategic options for Eurizon for several months, the sources said. The Italian lender wants to retain control of the unit, which has 315 billion euros in assets under management and operates in Italy as well as Eastern Europe and Asia. It would sell no more than 30 percent of Eurizon, two separate sources said. Intesa has said it would like a deal with a global asset manager to pave the way for other accords with smaller or same-size partners. If BlackRock takes the entire 30 percent stake which is up for sale, such deals could only translate into commercial partnerships. Yet BlackRock is expected to push for immediate control of the 30 percent stake, one of the sources said. In unveiling a new four-year business plan in February, Intesa said it aimed to strike an asset management partnership. Boss Carlo Messina said it made sense to act quickly and reach an accord this year. Speaking in Venice on June 15, however, Messina said the bank was still in the early stages of looking for an investor in its asset management business and was talking to several potential partners. For Intesa the transaction would help drive growth at Eurizon, which is already one of the most efficient asset managers in Europe with a cost-income ratio of 20 percent. “Size will matter more and more,” Eurizon CEO Tommaso Corcos said in a press interview in March. With a business model driven by revenues from its insurance and asset management arms, Intesa is targeting 10 billion euros in fees in 2021, accounting for 48 percent of its total operating income, up from 45 percent in 2017. The bank has so far been focused on cutting its problematic debt, reaching a deal in April with Swedish debt collector Intrum Justitia INTR.ST to cut soured loans below 10 percent of total lending."

-10.020707620608725," BlackRock promises selective fee cuts to capture growth NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc BLK.N, the world's largest asset manager, on Tuesday said it would continue to reduce fees on a small group of its products with the highest growth potential, days after cutting fees on 11 exchange-traded funds. Mark Wiedman, BlackRock’s global head of iShares and index investments, said at the company’s Investor Day that BlackRock is focused on areas where it can win or develop new markets and whose customers are most sensitive to price. The company’s ETF brand is called iShares. The fee cuts on Friday most deeply affected products in the bond market, including an emerging-market bond exchange-traded fund and another one invested in municipal bonds. The company is locked in a tight battle for assets with, among others, the Vanguard Group, which is known for offering low-cost index funds. Together the companies collected more than 60 percent of the record $655 billion that moved into ETFs globally in 2017, according to Morningstar Inc. BlackRock hopes to convert not just investors who are using index funds to replace stock and credit-picking managers but also institutional clients who might invest in individual bonds but prefer the convenience of a single trade. “We see these as fast-growth areas and we want to capture that growth,” said Wiedman. From 2012 to 2017, the average effective rate BlackRock charges across its assets dropped from $22.10 a year for every $10,000 under management to $19.10, according to BlackRock Chief Financial Officer Gary Shedlin. But Shedlin said most of that decline came from changing product demand by clients, market movement and the effect of foreign-exchange conversion, areas the company does not control. All of BlackRock’s price cuts in that time period were offset by growth, he said. They continue to spend roughly $1 billion a year on technology and will continue to aggressively put seed money into new products, which Shedlin described as one of the company’s best uses of cash. Over time, investments in technology will result in more general and administrative expenses relative to revenue, but will likely be offset by relative declines in spending on compensation, boosting profit margins. And the company’s dividends and buybacks continue as well, with the quarterly dividend rising nearly 9 percent to $3.13 a share, he said, pending approval by BlackRock’s board of directors and subject to market conditions. The company reviewed its spending plans after a U.S. tax law passed last year, which sliced corporate and individual income rates."
-10.648942240641858," Australia's Quintis handed lifeline by BlackRock-led bondholders SYDNEY (Reuters) - Bondholders led by BlackRock Inc have agreed to inject capital into Quintis Ltd and take it private, rescuing the Australian sandalwood firm after it collapsed in the wake of a short-seller attack. Between A$125 million and A$175 million ($95 million to $132 million) in capital will be provided and the bondholders will acquire control of the company, administrator McGrathNicol said in a statement. “It is expected that the proposal will be supported by growers, employees and creditors whose rights and long term interests are protected,” the statement said. It added that the proposal will make available a pool of funds to provide a return to unsecured creditors. BlackRock, the world’s biggest asset manager and the largest Quintis bondholder, declined to comment. Quintis was hit with one of the most aggressive shortselling attacks seen to date in Australia, when Glaucus Research Group said in March 2017 that its shares were worthless and suggested that a Chinese client was not a bonafide sandalwood buyer. Quintis said at the time that the Glaucus report was inaccurate and unfounded, but it went into administration in January after it was unable to make a payment to one of its bondholders. It had also terminated its contract with the Chinese client. The company owns sandalwood plantations in northern Australia and oil from the trees is sold to India and China for fragrances, cosmetics and medicinal uses. Formerly known as TFS Corp, it is one of the last remaining publicly listed managed investment schemes in Australia. Timbercorp Ltd and several other large forestry schemes have also collapsed, with their investment models criticized for frequently involving small investors borrowing money for high-risk operations."

The move comes amid plans by the world’s largest asset manager to double its investment stewardship team in the next three years from its current 30, one third of whom are based in Asia. In the past several years BlackRock has adjusted its stewardship approach “beyond voting at shareholder meetings to focus more on constructive engagement with companies, addressing rising expectations from clients and the companies themselves,” Michelle Edkins, its global head of investment stewardship, said in a statement.

-11.558208490195957," BlackRock may keep fees despite executive's U.S. campaign donation: SEC NEW YORK (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc can keep fees from the state of Ohio despite a donation one of its top executives made to Governor John Kasich’s U.S. presidential campaign, according to a preliminary ruling late on Friday by a securities regulator. Mark Wiedman, a senior managing director for the world’s largest asset manager, donated $2,700 to Kasich’s unsuccessful campaign when the politician was seeking the Republican Party nomination in 2016, according to public records. The money was later returned. A federal securities rule prohibits companies’ executive officers from making donations to government officials who could influence the hiring of a fund manager and then providing asset management services to those governments for a fee. The ban is in effect for two years after the contribution is made. Ohio uses BlackRock-managed funds, and its relationship with the asset manager predated the donation, BlackRock said when it asked the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to let it accept fees from the state, noting that exceptions to the rule have been granted before. The SEC’s ruling prevents BlackRock from facing a loss of approximately $37 million, according to the New York-based company’s filing. Wiedman is global head of iShares and index investments, a booming business within BlackRock that includes its exchange-traded funds. The iShares brand brought in nearly $35 billion of new cash into BlackRock in the first quarter. BlackRock manages $6.3 trillion overall. BlackRock declined to comment. Last year they said in a statement that Wiedman made the contribution solely in support of the campaign, and that both BlackRock and Wiedman promptly worked to address the error after the company discovered the contribution. The company also said Wiedman asked for and received a refund of his campaign contribution to Kasich and that its application to be exempted from the rule was “fair and reasonable.” A spokesman for the SEC was not immediately available."

-5.8163258090976155," Mexican leftist candidate has 'affable' meeting with BlackRock's Fink NEW YORK/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico’s presidential front-runner met BlackRock Inc Chief Executive Larry Fink on Monday, part of a push by the left-wing politician to reassure investors about his policies ahead of the July vote, and his team said the men clicked personally. Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who is ahead by double digits in most major polls, has been openly fighting with some Mexican business leaders, and said he would review major energy contracts and a $13 billion airport project. His campaign has met with multiple foreign fund managers in recent months to try and calm concerns about his policies, with aides telling investors that he is not opposed to foreign investment and markets. “They asked to speak with us and I accepted so we could get to know each other,” Lopez Obrador said in a local TV interview later on Monday. He said that he told Fink that he would uphold the rule of law and fight corruption, and not expropriate private property. “They have lots of information ... they’re intelligent,” Lopez Obrador added. BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is heavily invested in Mexico and in November announced it would acquire the local asset management business of a Citigroup Inc subsidiary. Fink met Lopez Obrador on Monday morning in Mexico City, the candidate’s adviser Carlos Urzua said, praising Fink’s understanding of the country. “It was a very affable meeting. ... There was an immediate click between them. They both left the meeting charmed,” said Urzua, who is Lopez Obrador’s pick for finance minister. BlackRock declined to comment on the content of the encounter. The meeting follows a change in tone from Lopez Obrador in recent days after a series of clashes with business leaders over what he calls influence trafficking. On Monday, he said a private concession could salvage the $13 billion airport project he has previously threatened to scrap. Markets have not reacted strongly to Lopez Obrador’s lead in the polls. The peso has weakened more than 7 percent against the dollar since mid-April, but the fall is mostly in line with other emerging market currencies. Fund managers and companies warn the next few months could be more volatile, partly on concerns over Lopez Obrador’s economic policy. BlackRock, which has $6.3 trillion in assets under management, engages with governments “irrespective of party affiliations,” the company said in a statement. Fink was a vocal supporter of President Enrique Pena Nieto’s economic reforms. Fink was due to meet with the management of clients, business partners and three other presidential campaigns - those of second-placed Ricardo Anaya, ruling party candidate Jose Antonio Meade and independent Margarita Zavala. The Anaya campaign confirmed they had met. A spokesman for Zavala said she was due to meet Fink on Monday afternoon. The campaign for Meade, who was finance minister before he became the candidate of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), said the two met for about half an hour in the afternoon. Describing the talks as “great” and “cordial”, Vanessa Rubio, a senior Meade campaign official, noted the two had known each other for years and that relations were “very close” with BlackRock while the PRI candidate was finance minister. According to a recent poll, less than two months before Mexicans vote, Lopez Obrador’s support grew to 39 percent from 38 percent in the previous poll at the end of March, but his lead narrowed to 14 points from 18. Fink has been consistently optimistic about the country’s prospects. In 2014, he said if he was starting his career, he might try his luck in Mexico. In recent years, BlackRock took a $900 million stake in the second phase of the Los Ramones pipeline project with private equity firm First Reserve. Marco Antonio Slim, a son of the country’s richest man, Carlos Slim, is a BlackRock board member."

-3.5685000743820616," MOVES-BlackRock hires private equity specialists from Goldman Sachs April 30 (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc said on Monday it is hiring two specialists from Goldman Sachs Group Inc to bolster its private equity business in New York, according to a staff memo. Steve Lessar and Konnin Tam will join the world’s largest asset management company from Goldman Sachs this summer, according to the document, which was seen by Reuters. Each will be responsible for expanding BlackRock’s role within a business that effectively enables investors in private companies and funds that invest in such firms to resell their stakes to other institutions. Normally, that money is locked up for years. This market for “secondary” private capital saw a record $58 billion in transaction activity in 2017, according to investment bank Greenhill & Co Inc, with money chasing better returns than exist within public markets. “Our plan is to place Steve and Konnin at the core of a team that will expand our existing offerings and make BAI the leader in this business,” said the memo, using the acronym for BlackRock Alternative Investors, a group that oversees largely private investments ranging from real estate to hedge funds. BlackRock is known for more widely offered funds that invest in publicly traded stocks and bonds. Yet Chief Executive Larry Fink has made it a priority to compete in private markets, too, against Goldman Sachs and other rivals better known for those sorts of investments, such as Blackstone Group LP. BlackRock was spun off from Blackstone more than two decades ago. Fink told Wall Street analysts earlier this month that he expects so-called illiquid alternative investments, which include private equity and typically come with higher fees than its other funds, to “be one of the more significant” drivers for BlackRock’s business over the next few years. Alternatives represent a fraction of BlackRock’s assets under management, growing at a slower rate than its other businesses, yet they account for outsized fee revenue.

-3.3204078916463153," BlackRock wants regulators to address unequal voting rights BOSTON (Reuters) - BlackRock Inc BLK.N on Thursday called on securities regulators to set international standards for shareholder voting rights, suggesting they resolve one of the thorniest debates in corporate governance. The world's largest asset manager made the call in a letter to index provider MSCI, which had sought comments about a proposal it is considering to adjust the index weighting of stocks like Facebook Inc FB.O and Google parent Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O to account for their unequal voting structures. BlackRock, which manages $6.3 trillion, said while it appreciates the index provider’s attention to the issues, MSCI’s proposed changes could distort markets. Instead, “we believe that policymakers, not index providers, should set corporate governance standards,” it stated in the letter, signed by BlackRock Vice Chairman Barbara Novick and posted on the firm’s website. Since last year a number of high-profile technology firms, including Spotify Technology SA SPOT.N, Dropbox Inc DBX.O and Snap Inc SNAP.N, have listed shares with a voting structure that gives lopsided decision-making power to insiders. According to the Council of Institutional Investors, among 124 IPOs in 2017, 23 had unequal voting rights, although some would give outside investors more voting power over time. Corporate executives say the structures help their firms focus on long-term growth. BlackRock and rivals like State Street Corp STT.N and Vanguard Group have criticized the trend but have bought the shares to fill index funds they say must try to replicate mandated market segments. MSCI and other providers last year made changes that excluded some stocks with unequal rights, like Snap, from widely followed indexes, including the S&P 500 and the Russell 1000. MSCI said in January it might make further changes after more consultation with clients. BlackRock’s Novick wrote that a global body like the International Organization of Securities Commissions would be well-positioned to suggest listing standards that national regulators could use. A Madrid-based spokeswoman for the organization said it has not undertaken work on the matter. U.S. regulations are still under development. A committee that advises the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in March recommended reforms like clear disclosures of different voting rights and of the risks that could result. SEC Chairman Jay Clayton said at the time he would like analysis of related areas like concerns about short-term investing and the attractiveness of U.S. capital markets. In February, Commissioner Robert Jackson said stock exchanges should develop some kind of limit on dual-class structures."
