-49.886795671744096," Google to buy stake in ADT in home security push for $450 million (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Google is picking up a 6.6% stake in ADT Inc ADT.N for $450 million, betting on the home security company's strong customer base and an army of technicians to drive sales of its Nest devices. ADT shares nearly doubled to hit a high of $17.2 and traded well above their IPO price of $14 for the first time since going public in 2018, briefly valuing the company at about $13 billion. The investment gives ADT the backing of a high-profile technology partner and broadens its services business. In return, Google gets access to about 6.5 million customers, strengthening its presence as it competes with Amazon.com's AMZN.O Ring and Boston-based SimpliSafe, among others. ADT said on Monday that the two companies would work on ways to package popular Google products like Home Mini, Nest Thermostat and Nest Wifi with ADT’s strength in installation and maintenance. “Later this year, we will begin integrating Google devices and make them available for installations to our customers,” ADT Chief Executive Officer Jim DeVries told Reuters. “We will exclusively support Nest products,” DeVries said, adding that the companies will build products together and start rolling them out next year. The companies will commit an additional $150 million each for co-marketing, product development, technology and employee training, ADT said. Google will buy 54.7 million newly created Class B shares of ADT for $8.22 each with no voting rights, the Boca Raton, Florida-based company said in a filing. Founded in 1874, ADT is backed by private-equity firm Apollo Global Management LLC, which owns 83.5% of the company, according to Refinitiv data. Apollo had taken ADT private in a nearly $7 billion deal in 2016."

-18.19450197910951," Home security firm ADT's outlook disappoints, shares fall 10 percent (Reuters) - ADT Inc reported a quarterly loss and forecast 2019 revenue and EBITDA below Wall Street estimates amid intensifying competition from fast-growing do-it-yourself home security offerings such as Google Nest. ADT’s shares fell more than 10 percent in after-hours trading. Security products such as Google Nest, SimpliSafe and Frontpoint can be self-installed, have a lower monthly fee and may or may not be monitored by a third party. These products compete with ADT’s Pulse, which allows users to monitor and manage their home remotely. ADT’s 2019 free cash flow growth forecast of 6 percent to 13 percent was a sharp deceleration from the more than 33 percent growth in 2018, as the company invests $40 million this year in initiatives such as branding to counter competition and hiring staff to expand its business. “We will make selective brand investments and we continue to solidify ADT’s position as the leader in home automation and security,” Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey Likosar said on a conference call. ADT has expanded its home security and commercial security offering through acquisitions over the past few months. The company bought do-it-yourself home security provider Lifeshield for about $25 million in February and purchased Advanced Cabling Systems - a provider of fire alarm and video surveillance systems - in January. ADT said it expects 2019 revenue in a range of $4.90 billion to $5.10 billion, largely below the average analyst estimate of $4.92 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The company’s full-year earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) outlook of between $2.46 billion and $2.50 billion was also below Wall Street expectations of $2.56 billion. ADT reported a net loss of $149 million, or 20 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a profit of $638 million, or 99 cents per share, a year earlier, when it recorded a benefit due to the U.S. tax reform. ADT took a goodwill impairment charge of $88 million in 2018 due to underperformance of its Canadian business. Revenue rose 7.1 to $1.19 billion."
