6.205654251597441," Walgreens maintains full-year profit growth forecast; shares rise (Reuters) - Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc said on Thursday it expects benefits from COVID-19 vaccinations to cushion the impact of pandemic-induced restrictions, and stuck to its full-year earnings growth forecast, sending its shares up 7%. The drugstore chain has taken a number of steps to bolster profit after the health crisis hammered sales and forced it to cut jobs, shut some UK-based Boots stores and sell its distribution unit to AmerisourceBergen Corp for $6.5 billion. Rival CVS Health Corp and Walgreens have an agreement with the federal government to vaccinate nursing home residents across the United States through a voluntary program. Walgreens said it expects to see some benefit from COVID-19 vaccinations in the second half of fiscal 2021. “The administration of vaccinations to care homes is not a particularly profitable business,” Chief Executive Officer Stephano Pessina said. “That being said, the vaccines will be accretive to the profile in the second half of the year. And that’s why... we did change the tone of our guidance.” Walgreens maintained fiscal 2021 forecast of low single-digit growth in adjusted EPS, after it beat analysts’ estimates for adjusted first-quarter profit. Same-store sales in Boots UK pharmacies rose 2.5% in the quarter, while Boots.com saw a 106% sales growth. Walgreens expects significant growth in its UK business in the second half of the year from cost cuts. The company, however, cautioned that the lockdown in the UK could hurt its business. “The big negative and the big question mark, and it’s the reason why we basically maintain guidance is, we actually have a lockdown in the U.K. right now that runs through the middle of February,” Chief Financial Officer James Kehoe said."

18.244740886183177," Exclusive: AmerisourceBergen eyes Walgreens' drug distribution business (Reuters) - AmerisourceBergen Corp ABC.N, one of the largest U.S. drug distributors, has approached Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc WBA.O to explore a deal for its pharmaceutical wholesaling division, people familiar with the matter said on Monday. Walgreens owns about 27% of AmerisourceBergen and is its biggest customer. The two companies have explored various possibilities for combining operations in recent years, including a sale of AmerisourceBergen to Walgreens, on the theory that their drug distribution businesses would be better positioned to withstand competitive price pressures through even bigger scale. The coronavirus pandemic has weighed on Walgreens’ retail business since then, however. Its shares have fallen more than 28 percent this year, compared to a 12% drop in the S&P 500 index due to the outbreak. AmerisourceBergen shares are flat year-to-date. AmerisourceBergen is willing to pay about $6 billion for the Walgreens pharmaceutical wholesale business, which operates mainly under the Alliance Healthcare brand, one of the sources said. There is no certainty that the two companies will negotiate a deal, the sources added, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Walgreens and AmerisourceBergen, which have market capitalizations of $37 billion and $18 billion, respectively, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. While Walgreens stores have remained open during the pandemic, the company said in April that sales at its locations had fallen as consumers stay home, often because they are avoiding doctor visits and have fewer prescriptions to fill. Walgreens has lost about half its value over the last five years amid growing distress in the retail sector and competition from online retailers, including Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O. Last year, the debt-laden pharmacy chain explored going private and held preliminary discussions with private equity firms, people familiar with the matter said at the time. A full or partial divestment of Alliance Healthcare would give Walgreens a cash injection and make it easier for Chief Executive Stefano Pessina, the company’s largest shareholder with a 16% stake, to take it private. The Deerfield, Illinois-based company, which operates the Walgreens and Duane Reade pharmacies in the United States and Boots in Britain, has more than 18,750 stores in over 25 countries. It has an agreement to source branded and generic drugs from AmerisourceBergen in the United States. It also allows AmerisourceBergen to access generic medicines through its global sourcing network."

-10.971210811089875," Dela. judge okays Supreme Court review of controversial books-and-records decision (Reuters) - Vice-Chancellor Travis Laster of Delaware Chancery Court signaled Wednesday that he really did intend to reset the course of books-and-records litigation when he ruled last month that the wholesale pharmaceutical distributor AmerisourceBergen give shareholders formal board materials related to opioid distribution. The judge granted AmerisourceBergen’s petition for certification of an interlocutory appeal of his Jan. 13 decision to the Delaware Supreme Court. And though, as Vice-Chancellor Laster noted, the state justices may still decide not to hear the case, the Chancery judge made it quite clear that he believes the Supreme Court should step in now to reconfirm the low bar for shareholders demanding to see corporate books and records. Want more On the Case? Listen to the On the Case podcast. Such demands have become routine in shareholder litigation in Delaware. The Supreme Court, as you know, has tightened its standards for shareholder breach-of-duty claims, arguably making it easier for corporate defendants to win dismissal of shareholder suits before plaintiffs can obtain discovery. At the same time, however, Delaware’s justices have repeatedly urged plaintiffs’ lawyers to take advantage of shareholders’ right to inspect corporate books before filing breach-of-duty derivative suits. Shareholders’ lawyers have taken that hint in droves, leading, as Kyle Compton Wagner of the Chancery Daily has observed, to a spike in the volume of books-and-records litigation in Chancery Court. But in recent years, according to Vice-Chancellor Laster, some Chancery rulings have imposed limits and conditions on shareholders’ rights of access. AmerisourceBergen, represented by Morgan Lewis & Bockius and Potter Anderson & Corroon, cited decisions in 2016’s Beatrice Corwin Living Irrevocable Trust v. Pfizer and 2019’s Hoeller v. Tempur Sealy to argue that shareholders must establish “a credible basis to suspect actionable wrongdoing” in order to obtain corporate books and records in advance of a prospective breach-of-duty suit. They also argued that under (among other rulings) the Pfizer decision and 2015’s Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority v. AbbVie, plaintiffs are required to identify not just a proper purpose for inspecting corporate books but also to specify what they intend to do with the records after they obtain them. AmerisourceBergen contended that because the statute of limitations and other defenses would preclude shareholders from asserting breach-of-duty claims against board members, plaintiffs were not entitled to corporate books and records. Vice-Chancellor Laster used his Jan. 13 decision to push back not just against AmerisourceBergen’s interpretations of Chancery precedent but also against the precedent itself. He harkened back to the Delaware Supreme Court’s landmark 2006 decision, Seinfeld v. Verizon, writing that the books-and-records statute “only requires that a stockholder establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that there is a credible basis to infer possible corporate wrongdoing or mismanagement.” And to the extent that other Chancery judges imposed a higher bar, Vice-Chancellor Laster said, those decisions “(go) beyond what Section 220 and Delaware Supreme Court precedent require.” AmerisourceBergen argued in its petition for an interlocutory appeal that Laster’s decision split with other Chancery rulings on three key points: whether shareholders must show both a purpose for their books and records demand and the ends to which they intend to use the corporate documents; whether plaintiffs must show the likelihood of an actionable case in order to obtain corporate records; and whether investors are permitted to conduct a deposition of a corporate representative to find out what materials might be available to them, in addition to formal board documents. Shareholders, represented by Prickett, Jones & Elliott and Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann, countered that the vice-chancellor had merely applied Supreme Court precedent so no “actual conflict” exists. “The routine application of Section 220 in this specific case has no ‘broader’ impact on Delaware corporate law. As such, (AmerisourceBergen) cannot satisfy the threshold requirement that the opinion determined a substantial issue,” shareholders said in their brief. But in Wednesday’s order certifying the appeal, Vice-Chancellor Laster suggested that Chancery needs some guidance from the Supreme Court. He said his opinion did, in fact, conflict with other Chancery decisions on issues with “widespread implications for how stockholders frame demands and how companies respond.” The judge said his ruling clearly contradicted trial court precedent on what shareholders must show to obtain book and records and arguably conflicts with a case that suggested investors are not entitled to depose corporate reps to broaden the scope of their books-and-records demands. All of these questions, he said, are “substantial issues of material importance.” The vice-chancellor said it would be more efficient for the Supreme Court to take the case now since the justices’ holding on the key legal questions - whether shareholders must show how they intend to make use of corporate documents and whether plaintiffs must make out a case of actionable wrongdoing in order to obtain access – could end the case. Moreover, said Vice-Chancellor Laster, a hearing now by the justices would “offer the wider benefit of having the Delaware Supreme Court bring clarity to the legal issues discussed in the opinion.” AmerisourceBergen’s lawyers at Morgan Lewis didn’t respond to an email I sent to their spokeswoman. Shareholders’ lawyer Samuel Closic of Prickett Jones declined to comment."
-2.901352842468691," Delaware Chancery judge pushes back against limits on books-and-records demands (Reuters) - There is a reasonable possibility, according to Vice-Chancellor Travis Laster, that shareholders of the wholesale pharmaceutical distributor AmerisourceBergen Corporation will turn out to have an actionable claim that the company’s directors breached their fiduciary duties by failing to avert what the judge called the “significant corporate trauma” of the opioid crisis. As Laster recounted in a Jan. 13 opinion ordering AmerisourceBergen to give shareholders access to years of formal board materials related to opioid distribution, the company is facing billions of dollars in exposure from private litigation and regulatory investigations stemming from its distribution of opioids. Shareholders have “a credible basis,” Vice-Chancellor Laster said, to use AmerisouceBergen’s internal books and records to explore whether board members and senior executives condoned or consciously ignored violations of reporting systems that might have alerted them about suspicious drug orders. That’s obviously an important ruling for AmerisourceBergen and for the shareholders who sued to obtain corporate books and records when the company balked at turning them over. But in the broader context of Delaware shareholder litigation, Vice-Chancellor Laster’s AmerisourceBergen opinion is notable for its strong defense of investors’ right to access corporate books, at a time when plaintiffs’ lawyers are making more frequent demands to see such books and records. The judge pushed back, hard, against a line of Delaware cases suggesting that in order to obtain books and records, shareholders must show evidence “from which a court could infer the existence of an actionable claim.” Want more On the Case? Listen to the On the Case podcast. Citing the Delaware Supreme Court’s 2006 ruling in Seinfeld v. Verizon, Vice-Chancellor Laster said the books-and-records statute “only requires that a stockholder establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that there is a credible basis to infer possible corporate wrongdoing or mismanagement.” That’s a much lower hurdle, he said, than the “actionable wrongdoing” theory espoused in AmerisourceBergen’s brief. “AmerisourceBergen’s actionable-wrongdoing requirement imposes an onerous burden on stockholders that goes beyond the standard established in Seinfeld,” Laster wrote. The Delaware Supreme Court, he pointed out, has repeatedly urged shareholders to use the books-and-records statute to investigate potential corporate wrongdoing before they file derivative suits accusing board members of breaching their fiduciary duties. That admonition, the judge said, would make no sense if investors had to show that they already had evidence of an actionable claim in order to obtain corporate documents. In fact, Vice-Chancellor Laster said, Delaware judges have in several instances granted defendants’ motions to dismiss breach-of-duty derivative suits - but have simultaneously allowed shareholders to use the books-and-records statute to conduct additional investigation. “The Delaware Supreme Court,” he said, “has never equated the credible-basis standard with an actionable-claim requirement.” AmerisourceBergen counsel Michael Blanchard of Morgan Lewis & Bockius and Stephen Norman of Potter Anderson & Corroon did not respond to an email request for comment. Nor did shareholders’ lawyers Gregory Varallo and Mark Lebovitch of Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann. Plaintiffs were also represented by Prickett Jones & Elliott; Kessler Topaz Meltzer & Check; and Hach Rose Schirripa & Cheverie. AmerisourceBergen’s primary argument had two prongs. First, the company contended that shareholders’ only intention, based on their demand for the company’s records and their retention agreements with plaintiffs’ lawyers, was to use the corporate records they obtained to bring a breach-of-duty derivative suit. And, according to the company, under case law from 2016’s Beatrice Corwin Living Irrevocable Trust v. Pfizer and 2019’s Hoeller v. Tempur Sealy, when shareholders file a books-and-records case in order to obtain discovery for an eventual derivative suit, they must establish that they have “a credible basis to suspect actionable wrongdoing.” In this case, the pharma distributor said, plaintiffs could not make such a showing because, among other things, directors’ good-faith actions were shielded by an exculpatory provision and all of shareholders’ prospective claims were time-barred. Vice-Chancellor Laster said AmerisourceBergen was wrong on both prongs of its argument. First, he said, the company erroneously asserted that shareholders must state how they intend to use corporate records in their demand to see internal materials. Two Delaware decisions have adopted such a “purpose-plus-an-end” test, the judge said, but both of those rulings involved shareholders that were quite obviously attempting to use the books-and-records statute to get discovery to use in litigation against the company. Courts, he said, are free to examine plaintiffs’ motives and conclude, like the judges in those cases, that shareholders are not entitled to see the records they want. But according to Vice-Chancellor Laster, nothing in the statute or Delaware Supreme Court precedent requires shareholders to reveal their intentions. The law “only requires that a stockholder state a proper purpose,” the judge wrote. “The Delaware Supreme Court has not gone further by requiring that a stockholder also say what it will do with the documents it receives.” And because the demand from AmerisourceBergen shareholders mentioned potential uses other than litigation for the requested internal records, Vice-Chancellor Laster said, the second prong of the company’s argument fails as well. AmerisourceBergen’s contention, based on the 2016 Pfizer decision, was that shareholders who intend to use corporate records in derivative suits must make a credible showing of an actionable claim – but, according to Laster, AmerisourceBergen could not satisfy the threshold test of establishing that shareholders were seeking its books and records in order to sue. Even if the company had made such a showing, the judge wrote, its argument was fatally flawed: Regardless of precedent suggesting otherwise, Vice-Chancellor Laster said, Delaware law does not demand that shareholders seeking corporate books and records satisfy a test that is more stringent than the standard for tossing a derivative suit on a dismissal motion. That simply cannot be, the judge said. “Generally speaking, when a corporation has suffered a trauma, and when there is a credible basis to suspect that the corporation has violated positive law or government regulations, then some level of investigation is warranted,” he wrote. As you know, books-and-records demands have become a routine tool for plaintiffs’ lawyers in Delaware after the state’s justices tightened pleading standards for derivative breach-of-duty suits. Clearly, Vice-Chancellor Laster is concerned that some of his Chancery Court colleagues are getting too miserly about allowing shareholders access to corporate records. He’s made a stand with his AmerisourceBergen opinion. It’s going to be interesting to see if the company asks the Delaware Supreme Court to prove Laster wrong."

-19.403419493681948," AmerisourceBergen to pay $625 million in U.S. civil fraud settlement NEW YORK (Reuters) - AmerisourceBergen Corp, one of the largest U.S. drug wholesalers, will pay $625 million to resolve civil fraud charges over the sale of syringes containing drugs for cancer patients, double billing, and providing kickbacks to doctors. The settlement announced on Monday by the U.S. Department of Justice boosts AmerisourceBergen’s total payout to $885 million over its repackaging and distribution of pre-filled syringes that were not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In September 2017, the company’s AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group unit pleaded guilty to a related misdemeanor, and paid $260 million of criminal fines and forfeitures. The Chesterbrook, Pennsylvania-based company also entered a five-year corporate integrity agreement to ensure compliance with federal health care rules. It set aside money for the entire civil settlement in its fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 2017. AmerisourceBergen admitted that from January 2001 to January 2014, its Medical Initiatives Inc pharmacy unit in Alabama shipped millions of syringes for patients undergoing chemotherapy that contained drugs prepared in an unsterile environment. Authorities said AmerisourceBergen would harvest “overfill” from the original vials of such drugs as Aloxi, Anzemet, Kytril and generic Kytril, Neupogen and Procrit used to combat side effects of chemotherapy, such as nausea and anemia. That enabled the company to create more doses than it bought, and generate at least $99.6 million of extra profit, authorities said. AmerisourceBergen was also accused of billing multiple doctors for individual vials, causing them to bill the government more than once, and paying kickbacks to induce doctors to buy drugs through the pre-filled syringe program. “ABC placed corporate profits over patients’ needs, endangering the health of vulnerable cancer patients,” U.S. Attorney Richard Donoghue in Brooklyn, New York said in a statement. New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood said $99.9 million of the payout will go to state Medicaid programs. Four whistleblowers including Michael Mullen, a former chief operating officer at AmerisourceBergen Specialty Group, will share $99 million from the payout, lawyers for Mullen said. AmerisourceBergen said in a statement that the settlement reflects its acknowledgment that some practices at the now-closed Medical Initiatives unit “were not consistent with AmerisourceBergen’s approach to corporate compliance.” The company’s shares rose 57 cents to $92.79 on Monday."

12.635308007079555," UPDATE 1-U.S. subpoenas AmerisourceBergen over opioid products (Adds further details) Aug 2 (Reuters) - Drug wholesale distributor AmerisourceBergen Corp said on Thursday it had received a grand jury subpoena from federal prosecutors in Florida seeking documents related to opioid products and its communications with a drugmaker. AmerisourceBergen said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it received the subpoena in May. The company is among several drug manufacturers and distributors facing lawsuits over their roles in the U.S. opioid epidemic. The company did not identify the pharmaceutical manufacturer cited in the subpoena. AmerisourceBergen said it is in the process of responding to it. The Chesterbrook, Pennsylvania-based company did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Opioids were involved in more than 42,000 overdose deaths in 2016, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Hundreds of lawsuits by states, counties and cities have accused drugmakers of pushing addictive painkillers through deceptive marketing and allege that wholesale distributors failed to report suspicious drug orders. AmerisourceBergen, which is among the defendants, is one of the largest drug distributors in the country. AmerisourceBergen and rivals Cardinal Health Inc and McKesson Corp control 85 percent of the U.S. prescription drug market. The subpoena came from the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida. That office previously in January sent grand jury subpoenas to pharmaceutical manufacturers Endo International Plc and Mallinckrodt Plc regarding products they produce that contain the opioid painkiller oxymorphone, both companies have said. Endo and Mallinckrodt did not immediately respond to a request for comment. AmerisourceBergen has previously disclosed receiving subpoenas dating back to 2012 from federal prosecutors in other states regarding its program for controlling and monitoring the diversion of controlled substances into improper channels.

-13.944244901815797," AmerisourceBergen sees Memphis plant back on track by 2019; shares rise (Reuters) - Drug distributor AmerisourceBergen Corp ABC.N posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday and said it expects its Memphis facility to be fully operational by fiscal 2019, sending its shares up 5 percent. Operations at the troubled facility, which produced around half the compounded drugs the company supplied, is expected to resume in phases, starting this year. The company has spent about $22 million since the beginning of the year to fix problems at the facility, Chief Financial Officer Tim Guttman said on a conference call, adding any income contribution this year is expected to be nominal. The Memphis plant was acquired as part of a 2015 buy of PharMEDium Healthcare Holdings and has remained closed since December following inspections by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Since the closure, revenue from AmerisourceBergen’s PharMEDium unit has been hit, but the drug distributor is confident of regaining customers it had lost, noting most clients had simply moved their business in-house. “There’s just not another large sophisticated competitor out there,” CFO Guttman said. AmerisourceBergen has repeatedly been rapped on the knuckles by regulators and state authorities who have cited violations and raised public health concerns relating to several facilities in its PharMEDium business. But the company noted its other plants remain open and called a recent FDA warning concerning its Lake Forest, Illinois facility “procedural”. Quarterly sales from the pharmaceutical distribution services unit, which houses PharMEDium, rose to $39.45 billion, beating estimates of $39.17 billion according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company reiterated its adjusted earnings per share forecast of between $6.45 to $6.65 for 2018, but said it expected earnings to be at the bottom end of that range. “Amerisource delivered a messy but likely better than feared second quarter,” EvercoreISI analyst Ross Muken said, noting some investors feared a forecast cut as deep as 20 to 30 cents. Excluding items, the company earned $1.94 per share. Analysts were expecting $1.82 per share.
