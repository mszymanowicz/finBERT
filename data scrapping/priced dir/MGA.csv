15.656463410560576," UPDATE 3-Magna revenue forecast shines, sees auto industry overcoming chip crunch by year-end (Adds CFO and analyst comment, details on margin, share movement) Feb 19 (Reuters) - Canadian auto parts maker Magna International Inc forecast full-year revenue above estimates on Friday and signalled it could make up for any production shortfall due to a global chip supply crunch by the end of 2021, lifting its U.S.-listed shares as much as 10%. Pent-up demand and customers preferring to buy vehicles seeking more safety during the COVID-19 health crisis have lifted auto sales and boosted demand for auto suppliers but the automotive chip shortage is forcing carmakers to trim production. “With respect to the semiconductor shortage, we see near-term disruptions to OEM production. However, at this point, any shortage is expected to be made up by the end of 2021,” Chief Financial Officer Vincent Galifi said on a post-earnings call with investors. Magna expects 2021 revenue of $40 billion to $41.6 billion, above analysts’ average estimate of $38.41 billion, according to Refinitiv I/B/E/S data. The Ontario-based company estimates light-vehicle production of 15.9 million units for 2021 in North America. In Europe, it expects full-year production to be 18.5 million units and 24 million units in China, all above 2020 levels but below pre-pandemic levels of 2019. “The center of the result was robust margin,” Credit Suisse analyst Dan Levy said. Adjusted EBIT margin was 10.4% in the fourth quarter, compared with 6.3% last year. Levy said Magna’s results would not only help the auto supplier’s momentum but also set the tenure of new Chief Executive Officer Swamy Kotagiri on a strong footing. Net income attributable to Magna surged 67% to $738 million, while adjusted earnings per share of $2.83 beat estimates of $2.02. Revenue rose 12.4% to $10.57 billion, also beating estimates of $10.02 billion. The company raised its quarterly cash dividend by 8% to 43 cents per share.

21.182134289471723," UPDATE 2-LG and Magna announce billion dollar joint venture in electric car gear (Adds LG Elec’s share movement, Magna CEO’s quotes) TORONTO/SEOUL, Dec 23 (Reuters) - South Korea-based LG Electronics Inc and automotive supplier Magna International Inc are launching a joint venture that will make key components for electric cars, the companies announced on Wednesday. The joint venture, tentatively called LG Magna e-Powertrain and valued at $1 billion, will manufacture e-motors, inverters and onboard chargers, according to LG Electronics. The deal expands a wave of consolidation among suppliers aiming to capture a growing market for electric vehicle, e-axle systems, which combine electric motors, power controls and driving gears in one unit. Earlier this year, gear maker BorgWarner Inc acquired rival Delphi, and Japanese manufacturers Aisin Seiki Corp, Denso Corp and Toyota Motor Corp have created a new e-axle venture called BluE Nexus. Shares of LG Electronics jumped as much as 24.7% as of 0358 GMT to their highest since 2011, compared to the broader market KOSPI’s 1% rise. LG Electronics is an affiliate of South Korea’s fourth-largest conglomerate, with interests ranging from electronics, including smartphones, to home appliances. LG Group’s major affiliates include LG Display Co Ltd, which counts Apple Inc as its customer, as well as LG Chem Ltd, whose wholly owned LG Energy Solution subsidiary provides EV batteries to Tesla Inc. LG will own 51% of the new company and Magna will own 49%, LG said. The transaction is expected to close in July 2021 pending LG shareholder approval, among other conditions, and will employ 1,000 people at LG locations in the United States, Seoul and China, according to a press release. LG has previously supplied motors, battery packs and other components to GM’S Bolt EV. Magna already makes electronic vehicle gear for companies including Volkswagen. But gaining more control over production of the high-value parts of an electric car “has always been part of the strategy as we move forward,” Magna’s incoming CEO, Swamy Kotagiri said in an interview with Reuters on Tuesday ahead of the announcement. “With combined synergies of both companies together I think we’ll be able to address not only our existing customers, but all the major audiences and preferably the new entrances looking for electric platforms,” he said. LG Electronics’ vehicle component solutions business has reported 19 quarters of consecutive losses. When asked about the timeline of its Vehicle Component Solutions business’ turnaround during an earnings call in October, the company said LG Electronics expects to swing to profit in the third quarter of next year. Sales from this business were $150 million in 2019, but Kotagiri said he expects a compound annual growth rate of around 50% by 2025.

The Ontario-based company also raised its 2020 sales outlook to $31.5 billion-$32.5 billion from $30 billion-$32 billion. Analysts were expecting $31.4 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Auto sales in North America have gradually recovered since lockdown measures were eased, prompting major automakers to ramp up production and rebuild inventories for high-margin sport utility vehicles and pickup trucks. That has lifted sales at several auto suppliers including Magna, which makes parts such as body structures, chassis and powertrain for customers including Ford Motor F.N and Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE. Magna also raised its 2020 North American light vehicle production outlook to 12.7 million units from 12.5 million. In Europe, it now expects full-year production to be about 16.1 million units, compared with 15.9 million before. Last week, auto technology supplier Aptiv Plc APTV.N too forecast better-than-expected results for 2020 and gave a bullish outlook for growth for its electrification and assisted driving technology. Magna’s light vehicle production was down 5% in Europe, flat in the United States and rose 10% in China during the third quarter. In the prior quarter, production in Europe and the United States had slumped 59% and 70% respectively, while it was up 3% in China. Magna reported a net income of $405 million, or $1.35 per share, for the third quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with a loss of $233 million, or 75 cents per share, a year earlier.

39.24024680698889," Fisker closes deal for supplier Magna to build its SUV, take stake in startup DETROIT (Reuters) - Fisker Inc, which is going public through a merger with a so-called blank check company, said on Thursday auto supplier Magna International Inc MG.TO will supply the vehicle platform and build the electric carmaker's Ocean SUV. As part of the deal, Magna will receive warrants to purchase a stake of up to 6% in Fisker, giving the EV maker an overall valuation of about $3 billion, Fisker Chief Executive Henrik Fisker told Reuters. “We’re full speed ahead,” Fisker said in a telephone interview. “This is a huge turning point. We realized Magna would be an amazing partner because having skin in the game obviously means we both have the same goal of getting this car to market.” Fisker, which is merging with Spartan Energy Acquisition Corp SPAQ.N, said it had finalized a deal with Canada's Magna to build the Ocean in Europe, marking the Canadian supplier's first entry into contract manufacturing for an EV startup. While Magna has built vehicles for traditional automakers for years, analysts and investors have speculated it could eventually build for technology companies like Apple Inc AAPL.O. Magna retrofits vehicles for Alphabet's GOOGL.O Waymo and builds vehicles for BMW AG BMWG.DE, Daimler AG's< DAIGn.DE> Mercedes-Benz and Tata Motors Ltd's TAMO.NS Jaguar Land Rover at its plant in Graz, Austria. Magna also has a tentative deal to build vehicles for EV startup Canoo Holdings Ltd HCACU.O, which is also going public later this year through a reverse merger with a special-purpose acquisition company, or SPAC. Magna’s stake in Fisker is subject to hitting three engineering and production milestones through the planned start of production of the Ocean in November 2022, Henrik Fisker said. Fisker Inc said in August it had a tentative deal for Magna to build the SUV at its Graz plant. Magna President Swamy Kotagiri told Reuters the stake is more about Magna getting compensated. “We really want to be the Switzerland for the automotive industry - neutrality,” he said. “We’re not siding with one customer.” “This is a unique competitive position for us, particularly with new mobility players and (automakers) seeking to expand their electrified offerings.” Further terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Kotagiri said Fisker’s pricing was based on volume. Fisker is targeting initial sales of 8,000 SUVs in 2022, 51,000 in 2023 and 175,000 in 2024. Fisker had previously said it was negotiating to use Volkswagen AG's VOWG_p.DE MEB electric-vehicle platform, but Henrik Fisker said the company remains in talks with the German automaker to use unspecified body and interior parts. Closing a deal addressing Fisker Inc’s platform and manufacturing needs was seen as critical by investors. Fisker’s inability in July to close the deal it initially targeted with VW sent shares in Spartan Energy down 20%. Fisker and Magna are in talks with major EV battery manufacturers about supplying the necessary batteries, a Fisker spokesman said. Use of Magna’s aluminum-intensive vehicle platform will allow the Ocean to have an electric driving range of more than 300 miles (483 km) and enable Fisker to offer buyers the option of a third row of seating, Henrik Fisker said. The vehicle will have a starting price of $37,499. Fisker Inc’s merger with Spartan is expected to close on Oct. 30 and its shares will trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol “FSR,” Henrik Fisker said."

Fisker said in a statement that it expects to reach a definitive agreement “in the next few months” to have Magna Steyr start production of the Fisker Ocean at its Graz, Austria, plant as early as the fourth quarter of 2022. A Magna spokesman confirmed the memorandum of understanding, but declined further comment. Fisker added the companies were “also evaluating manufacturing options for the United States and China.” Spartan Energy Acquisition Corp, backed by alternative investment manager Apollo Global Management Inc , announced a deal last month to take Fisker public through a merger that valued the EV startup at $2.9 billion. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter. A blank-check company, or SPAC, is a shell company that raises money through an initial public offering to buy an operating company, typically within two years. Shares of Spartan were off 2.2% at $13.44 on Friday afternoon, well below the high of $23.86 when the deal was announced. The stock is still above Spartan’s IPO price of $10. Spartan shares fell 20% last week after Fisker disclosed it would not close a deal by the end of July as previously hoped to use Volkswagen AG’s EV platform for its Ocean SUV. Fisker said when it announced the Spartan deal that it was in talks with VW to use the German automaker’s MEB EV platform to speed vehicle development and cut costs.

17.706483478516315," Auto supplier Magna's sales beat as virus-hit vehicle production rebounds (Reuters) - Auto parts maker Magna International Inc MG.TO on Friday reported better-than-expected quarterly revenue and forecast full-year sales above estimates, as vehicle production in North America showed signs of a recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. The company said it lost about $5.5 billion in sales during the second quarter, as its customers shut production amid government-enforced lockdowns. Light-vehicle production in North America, Magna’s biggest market, tumbled 70% in the period. But as economies reopen following easing of the lockdowns, North America auto sales have gradually recovered since hitting a bottom in April, resulting in major automakers scrambling to ramp up production and boost weak inventories at dealerships. That has lifted sales at several auto suppliers including Canada's Magna, which makes parts such as body structures, chassis and powertrain for customers including Ford Motor F.N and Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE. “While our second quarter results were impacted by a precipitous decline in global vehicle production ... I am pleased we have been able to successfully restart operations at our plants around the world,” Chief Executive Officer Don Walker said in a statement. Ontario-based Magna had pulled its full-year financial outlook in March, and now expects 2020 sales between $30 billion and $32 billion, above analysts’ estimate of $30.2 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. However, the sales target is still down between 19% and 24% compared with a year earlier. Earlier this week, U.S. auto parts makers BorgWarner Inc BWA.N also reported a smaller-than-expected second-quarter loss and raised its full-year free cash flow outlook amid rebounding auto production. On an adjusted basis, Magna lost $1.71 per share in the quarter ended June 30, bigger than estimates of a loss of $1.57 per share.

37.557595009449976," Auto supplier Magna preparing for North America return to work May 4: exec DETROIT (Reuters) - Canadian auto supplier Magna International Inc MG.TO is planning for a return to production in North America on May 4, with a subsequent gradual increase in output as the industry recovers from the shutdown caused by the coronavirus pandemic, a top executive said on Wednesday. Most U.S. states have stay-at-home orders in place through the end of April, but many automakers and suppliers hope evidence of an easing in the COVID-19 infection rate will lead to a re-opening of factories. President Donald Trump has expressed a desire to get Americans back to work soon. “As we stand today, we have everything in place as if the plants are coming back on May 4,” Magna President Swamy Kotagiri said in a telephone interview. The auto industry has already reopened in China, where Magna has some plants back at 80% capacity, and is just now restarting operations in Europe. In the United States, General Motors Co GM.N, Ford Motor Co F.N and other companies are waiting for the go-ahead from various governors but are aiming for an early May restart. Kotagiri said there is “no written play book” for the pandemic and understands production could be further delayed, but he is ready if that happens. What would worry him more would be restarting and then having to stop again. “The most important thing is, How can we as an industry coordinate and minimize the start-stops?” he said. “If someone comes and says, ‘It’s not May 4, it’s May 10.’ That’s OK. It’s easy to deal with,” said Kotagiri, who was promoted to president in January. “But if somebody comes and says to start on the 4th and we stop again on the 12th, that’s a bigger problem.” Magna, which makes parts such as body structures, chassis and powertrain for customers including Ford and Volkswagen AG VOWG_p.DE, has about 70 employees globally recovering from COVID-19 and has seen three in North America die from the virus. Last month, Magna withdrew its financial outlook, citing the pandemic, but said its liquidity was strong. After increasing a revolving credit facility on Tuesday, Magna has $1 billion in cash and $3.7 billion in available credit lines. As for the restart, Magna is planning heavily for it, including drawing up an almost 60-page “Smart Start Playbook” to help with the transition, talking about best practices, and details like disinfecting guidelines, the use of personal protective equipment like masks and face shields, as well as treating and tracing infected employees."

The company last year closed some underperforming plants in North America, as production fell due to lower demand. Magna also warned that coronavirus outbreak in China, which generates about 5% of its annual sales, could further hit its 2020 sales, as the full impact of the epidemic is yet to be ascertained. “We have not included any adjustment to our outlook related to coronavirus, as it is difficult to forecast when our customers’ facilities in China will be fully operational,” Magna said in a statement. The company said it continues to expect full-year sales of about $39 billion, the mid-point of its forecast range of $38 billion to $40 billion, compared with $39.43 billion in 2019. Other North American peers including BorgWarner Inc and Visteon Corp have been struggling due to weak automotive demand in a slowing Chinese economy, where the coronavirus spread has aggravated a downtrend in the industry. Magna, which makes parts such as body structures, chassis and powertrain for customers including Ford Motor and Volkswagen, said its cost of goods sold fell 7.2% to $8.09 billion in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31.

-36.18694827329732," Auto parts maker Magna expects lower 2020 sales, scraps Lyft partnership (Reuters) - Canadian auto parts maker Magna International Inc MG.TO on Thursday forecast lower 2020 sales and scrapped its partnership with Lyft LYFT.O to co-develop self-driving technology as it said it would instead focus on developing assisted driving technology. Magna blamed the stronger U.S. dollar, the sale of its fluid pressure and controls business, and estimated lower light-vehicle production in Europe for its lower sales outlook. The end of the partnership with Lyft to develop self-driving technology was driven by Magna’s belief that growth in the near and medium term - out to 2025 - is more in the driver-assisted market, called the L1, L2 and L3 market, said Swamy Kotagiri, who was promoted to president on Thursday. “It’s a refocus on the assisted driving part of autonomy,” he told Reuters in a telephone interview. While Magna will cease working with Lyft on developing self-driving technology, it will still collaborate with the company on various software and hardware programs, he said. Magna invested $200 million in the U.S. ride-hailing firm in 2018 to manufacture self-driving cars. (reut.rs/2Nx7zxQ) Magna said its 2020 operating margins would improve due to lower spending on developing assisted and autonomous technology as well as the end of the Lyft-related spending. Kotagiri told Reuters that, excluding Lyft, the company’s spending on developing technologies for autonomous and electric vehicles was rising. Magna Chief Executive Don Walker said on a conference call with analysts that the auto sector has become “more realistic” about how fast various autonomous technologies will penetrate. Chief Financial Officer Vince Galifi emphasized that Magna will invest “where we’re going to get a higher volume.” Magna’s current advanced driver-assistance systems business is running above $550 million, but the growth is lumpy and the big increase in revenue comes beyond 2022, Galifi said. The Ontario, Canada-based company said it expects 2020 sales to be between $38 billion and $40 billion and net income attributable to be in the range of $1.8 billion to $2 billion. Analysts on average expect Magna to report revenue of $39.97 billion and profit of $1.94 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv."

The strike will also hit consolidated margins by about 30 basis points, Magna said on a post-earnings conference call."
-9.488737962316767," Canada's Magna cuts 2019 outlook as GM strike weighs (Reuters) - Auto parts maker Magna International Inc MG.TO cut its full-year financial outlook, after quarterly sales missed estimates on Friday due to a fall in global automobile production and a labor strike at General Motors Co GM.N, its biggest customer. Slowing global economy amid the U.S.-China trade war has hurt consumer sentiment that has weighed on auto sales, while trade tariffs on metals have pushed vehicle production costs up by billions of dollars, hurting automakers and parts suppliers’ profitability. A 40-day strike at the No.1 U.S. carmaker, General Motors, has added to auto parts makers’ pain, in the form of lost revenue. Magna, which makes parts such as body structures, chassis and powertrain for customers including Ford Motor F.N and Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE, cut its 2019 sales outlook to between $38.7 billion and $39.8 billion, from its previous range of $38.9 billion to $41.1 billion, largely due to the strike at GM. The company now expects full-year net income between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion, down from its prior range of $1.9 billion and $2.1 billion. “We have made some adjustments to our outlook largely to reflect estimated lost volume related to the GM strike and higher launch costs,” Chief Financial Officer Vince Galifi said. Several auto parts makers and suppliers have lowered their full-year forecasts and disclosed hits to quarterly earnings due to the strike. Earlier this month drivetrain systems maker American Axle and Manufacturing Holdings AXL.N said the strike reduced third-quarter sales by $57 million, and warned of an about $250 million hit to full-year revenue. Aptiv Plc APTV.N said last month the strike knocked off $70 million from the company's quarterly revenue and reduced profit by 10 cents per share in the third quarter. Magna recorded non-cash impairment charges of $537 million after income taxes in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 and reported adjusted earnings before interest and taxes of $558 million, below analysts’ expectation of $572 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Total sales fell 3% to $9.32 billion, missing the Wall Street estimate of $9.33 billion. (The story corrects day in first paragraph to Friday from Thursday.)"

13.817117046337618," Canada's Magna trims sales forecast in trade war hit (Reuters) - Canada's Magna International Inc MG.TO trimmed its sales forecast for the second time this year, as weak global demand and the impact of U.S.-China trade tensions pushed down vehicle production in North America and Europe. The roughly $200 million cut was not as bad as feared and the company's profit beat analysts' consensus forecasts, sending its U.S.-listed shares MGA up 4% in trading before the bell in New York. But the numbers were another sign of the pain the North American automotive industry is beginning to face from a series of major political shocks to its supply chains and cost base. Automakers have warned that tariffs on metals and other items resulting from President Donald Trump’s trade war with China will add billions of dollars in costs to vehicle production and assembly. The European auto sector has also been struggling with worsening consumer sentiment as well as concerns over the potential fallout for demand and manufacturing of Britain’s exit from the European Union. Magna on Thursday said it now expects total sales of $38.9 billion to $41.1 billion, compared with its previous estimate of $39.1 billion to $41.3 billion. “Given ... expectations by many for a guidance cut (similar to other suppliers during earnings season), we believe the bar was likely solidly cleared,” Credit Suisse analysts said. The company had previously cut its forecast in May, citing higher-than-expected costs in certain advanced driver assistance systems programs, lower anticipated sales from a transmission joint venture in China and a decline in vehicle production. Magna - which assembles cars for BMW BMWG.DE, Daimler DAIGn.DE and Jaguar Land Rover - also cut its forecast for light vehicle production volume in North America to 16.6 million from 16.7 million. For Europe, it was trimmed to 21.4 million from 21.5 million. Excluding items, the company earned $1.59 per share, while analyst were expecting $1.53, according to IBES Refintiv data. Brokerage TD Securities attributed the beat at the company’s complete vehicles unit, which assembles and manufactures cars, to some one-off benefits. Analysts at Credit Suisse also flagged a beat at the company’s power and vision segment, that makes mirrors and lights, despite deteriorating conditions in China. Total sales fell 1.5% to $10.13 billion in the latest quarter, with global light vehicle production down 6%."

-18.22789839168504," UPDATE 3-Magna profit beats expectations, auto parts maker stock up (New throughout, adds tariff impact, comments from conference call and analyst, updates stock price) Feb 22 TORONTO (Reuters) - Canada’s Magna International Inc said on Friday profits beat market forecasts as a big spike in vehicle assembly work more than offset declining global auto production in the fourth quarter. Shares of Magna popped 3.8 percent higher after the world’s third-biggest auto supplier said profits fell less than analysts had feared in the latest quarter, partly reflecting a lower share count from its buyback program. The Aurora, Ontario-based company said it expects its performance to strengthen in the second half of 2019 from the first six months, reflecting its forecast for global vehicle output. But trade wars will pinch that performance, with Magna’s 2019 tariff hit estimated at $45 million to $50 million. “Tariffs continue to hurt us,” Chief Executive Don Walker said on a conference call with analysts. “Tariffs within the NAFTA region...(are) bad for all three countries, including the States, because their input costs become higher, and obviously, it’s less competitive.” Magna also boosted its dividend by 11 percent, its tenth consecutive annual increase, and recorded $951 million in free cash flow in the quarter, while it spent $479 million to repurchase 9.9 million shares. Total sales grew nearly 5 percent from a year earlier, to $10.14 billion, as complete vehicle assembly sales soared 39 percent to $1.7 million. Demand at the lower-profit unit was lifted by new launches for such automakers as Daimler and Jaguar. Excluding one-time items, Magna earned $1.63 per share, down from $1.58 in the same period last year, but ahead of the consensus expectation of $1.59 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Net income attributable to Magna fell to $456 million, or $1.37 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31 from $559 million, or $1.54 per share, a year earlier. Sales at Magna’s biggest unit, which makes vehicle structures, fell 4 percent to $4.18 million. The company’s power and vision division, which also provides parts for electric and self-driving vehicles, recorded a 1 percent increase in sales to $2.9 billion. Magna said it will invest $70 million in next-generation vehicles in 2019, down from $100 million in 2018, which will continue to erode margins in the power and vision unit. Quarterly adjusted earnings of $1.63 per share bettered a consensus estimate of $1.59 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Net income attributable to Magna declined to $456 million from $559 million. The results include a $60 million impairment charge, on a joint venture in Europe with Ford, reflecting declining demand for manual transmissions.

The company expects total revenue of $40.2 billion to $42.4 billion and net income of $2.1 billion to $2.3 billion in 2019. Analysts expect the company to report revenue of $41.3 billion and profit of $2.34 billion for the full year, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Magna agreed to sell the fluid pressure and controls business, which includes electronic pumps and cooling fans, to South Korea-based Hanon Systems for $1.23 billion in September last year. The company also said its North American business will be hurt by General Motors Co's GM.N decision to close its Oshawa plant in Ontario. In November, GM announced the closure of three assembly plants as part of a wider restructuring. Magna also forecast a slight decline in its earnings before interest and taxes due to higher commodity costs."

The Aurora, Ontario-based company now expects light vehicle production - its main measure for output of a diverse range of parts and assembly work - to reach 17 million units in North America, down from a previous forecast of 17.2 million. The company also said it expects costs in its unit handling auto exteriors and structures to go up and total sales in fiscal 2018 to be between $40.3 and $41.4 billion compared to an earlier range of $40.3 to $42.5 billion. North America’s biggest auto parts maker, Magna is in the crosshairs of ongoing trade tensions, grappling with higher metal prices after the Trump administration levied tariffs on steel and aluminum imports, triggering retaliation. In the quarter ending Sept. 30, light vehicle production in North America increased 4 percent. Sales at its complete vehicle segment, which produces cars for BMW and Daimler, rose 48 percent to $1.4 billion but also showed the sharpest cut in the renewed outlook, down from $6.1-$6.5 billion to a range of $5.9-$6.1 billion.

-3.9762351905068885," UPDATE 2-Auto parts maker Magna hit by trade dispute; cuts outlook (Adds comments by CEO and CFO, adds analyst comment, industry background, updates share price.) Aug 8 (Reuters) - Canadian auto parts maker Magna International Inc on Wednesday lowered its full-year production outlook for North America, and revised downward its global sales, hurt in part by U.S. tariffs and other “headwinds” during the quarter, sending its stock down more than 8 percent in U.S. trading. Magna expects an annualized impact of $60 million from tariffs introduced by the United States on metals and other imported items, with $30 million to come in the back half of 2018, Chief Executive Don Walker told analysts. U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration imposed a 25 percent tariff on steel imports from Canada, Europe and others at the end of May, sparking retaliation. The United States and China also implemented tariffs on $34 billion worth of each other’s goods in July. Magna Chief Financial Officer Vince Galifi said most of the tariff-related costs will hit the company’s U.S. plants, primarily because of steel and other imports from China. “As far as what’s going on with all of the tariff activity, it’s certainly in flux,” Walker said. The Trump administration also faces criticism as it considers tariffs of up to 25 percent on U.S. imports of autos and car parts. Edward Jones analyst Jeff Windau said in a note that “recent trade discussions by the U.S. government and the associated tariffs appear to be leading to higher costs” which could “pressure profitability.” Magna, North America’s largest auto parts maker, also expects lower production volumes for the balance of the year in certain transmission programs and lower equity income than previously anticipated from joint ventures, particularly in China. “We certainly had some headwinds this quarter,” Walker said. Magna missed analysts’ profit estimates partly because of lackluster demand in North America. Magna expects light vehicle production in North America to be 17.2 million, down from its previous forecast of 17.3 million and cut 2018 total sales forecasts to between $40.3 billion and $42.5 billion, down from $40.9 billion to $43.1 billion. Net income attributable to Magna rose to $626 million or $1.77 per share, in the quarter ended June 30, from $548 million, or $1.44 per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned $1.67 per share. Analysts, on an average, had expected the company to report a profit of $1.72 on a revenue of $10.51 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Magna shares were down 7.6 percent at C$71.02 on the Toronto Stock Exchange while the U.S. listed shares were down 8.1 percent at $54.42."
-3.9762351905068885," CORRECTED-UPDATE 1-Canada's Magna lowers production forecast on expected hit from tariffs (Corrects paragraph 5 to say company’s light vehicle production rose in “first half of 2018”, not “second quarter”) Aug 8 (Reuters) - Canadian auto parts maker Magna International Inc lowered its full-year production forecast for North America, hurt in part by tariffs imposed by the Trump administration. The company, which reported second-quarter profit below analysts’ estimates on tepid demand in North America, its biggest market, said it expects light vehicle production in the region to be 17.2 million, down from its previous forecast of 17.3 million. The Trump administration has come under heavy criticism from automakers, foreign governments and others as it considers tariffs of up to 25 percent on U.S. imports of autos and car parts. Magna said in May it is “cautiously optimistic” that talks to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) would result in a competitive trade deal. During the first half of 2018, Magna’s light vehicle production increased 4 percent in Europe but declined 1 percent in North America. Magna said total sales during the quarter jumped 12.5 percent to $10.28 billion. Net income attributable to Magna rose to $626 million or $1.77 per share, in the quarter ended June 30, from $548 million, or $1.44 per share, a year earlier.

-15.893205958167247," Magna-BAIC deal raises prospects for an 'automotive Foxconn' in China BEIJING (Reuters) - In China, where the future of the car is looking more and more electric, newcomers to the auto industry are looking for partners to help them build their vehicles. Enter Canadian auto supplier Magna International MG.TO which aims to spearhead a shift to contract vehicle manufacturing through its new partnership with state-owned Chinese carmaker BAIC Group [BEJINS.UL]. According to five people familiar with the matter, their joint venture is likely to build vehicles for ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing and possibly Chinese electric car startup Singulato Motors, in addition to BAIC’s electric unit BJEV. The venture has yet to disclose talks with Didi and Singulato. The Magna-BAIC deal, announced in June, realises a long-held dream of Magna Steyr, the supplier’s Austrian unit and the world’s biggest player in the still niche business of contract car assembly, to expand beyond Europe. It could also portend the rise of an 'automotive Foxconn' for electric cars - an idea discussed by industry executives for years. Given EVs' low volumes compared to traditional models, it makes sense for some firms to outsource assembly in the same way Apple Inc AAPL.O and other tech companies do with Taiwan's Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd 2317.TW. The time is ripe for such a development in China, some experts say. Beijing’s use of industry quotas and other policies to make the world’s biggest auto market as electric as possible has given rise to at least 50 Chinese EV startups, many of which will need a helping hand. Magna is well placed to take on the challenge, already producing cars for Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Jaguar in Europe, including the all-electric Jaguar I-Pace SUV. The venture with BAIC will co-opt a BAIC plant in Zhenjiang in the eastern province of Jiangsu which has an annual production capacity of 180,000 vehicles. “This is exactly what some people think companies like Tesla should have done — let experienced companies like Magna do the manufacturing for them,” said James Chao, Shanghai-based chief analyst at consultancy IHS Markit. “They would allow them to ramp up much more quickly, without production hiccups.” Magna officials say the China joint venture's primary objective is to help develop vehicle technologies for BJEV. It is also expected to produce cars for BJEV's Arcfox brand that aims to compete with Tesla Inc TSLA.O, according to BAIC. But it could offer the same services to external companies or make “already developed products” with different platforms from the one the joint venture would help develop for BJEV, said Klaus Drobnak, head of Magna Steyr’s Asia operations. Asked how quickly and big contract manufacturing would grow in China, Drobnak, who is based at Magna Steyr’s headquarters in Graz, Austria, said he wasn’t sure at this early stage. “But we are trying to spearhead such a development,” he said. BAIC spokesman Lian Qingfeng said there are some auto companies in China who need a premium manufacturing service and that “any of them could be the potential customer of the new JV.” Didi will most likely be one of Magna’s first clients in China given its deal with BAIC this year to work together on customised vehicle design, according to three of the people. All sources declined to identified as they were not authorised to speak to media on the matter. The firm, which dominates China’s ride-hailing market and which sources have said was valued at $56 billion in 2017, wants its own fleet, tailored for ride-hailing and car-sharing. The cars are set to emphasise passenger comfort but may not have features such as the high performance engines found in mainstream models as they will not need to go that fast. Its plans come amid increased restrictions on car ownership in cities such as Beijing and Guangzhou to ease congestion and combat pollution - changes expected to spur more use of ride-hailing and car-sharing, said Yale Zhang, head of Shanghai-based consultancy Automotive Foresight. Didi’s first-generation car, dubbed the D1 internally, is slated to be deployed by 2020, people familiar with the plans said. Its D2 and D3 models are also being worked on, although they are still in the early planning stages. Didi declined to comment on specific plans, saying only that BAIC was a valued partner. For both companies, partnering makes sense as they seek to manage the very expensive costs involved in electric car technologies. “We pay half and half for R&D and manufacturing costs and we would share revenues. We save a ton of money,” said one of the people. Singulato, backed by domestic investors and Intel Corp INTC.O which has a small stake, also has a pre-existing partnership with BAIC. That deal includes the development of 'intelligent vehicles' and sharing manufacturing resources. It needs a contract manufacturer’s help rather urgently because it has not yet received a car assembly license from regulators, even though it plans to begin producing and selling its first model, an SUV called the iS6, by the end of this year. Two sources said the Magna-BAIC plant, which needs to be modified and re-tooled in line with Magna’s production system, may not be able to help Singulato immediately. In that case, the iS6 would likely be first made by BAIC with the joint venture possibly taking over later, they said. “Even if Magna in the end were not able to help Singulato initially, it’s great for BAIC to have access to Magna’s engineering, manufacturing and quality-control know-how,” said one of the people."
-15.893205958167247," RPT-FOCUS-Magna-BAIC deal raises prospects for an 'automotive Foxconn' in China (Repeats with no change to text) * Magna’s Austrian unit is world’s biggest contract car maker * Didi likely among Magna-BAIC’s first customers -sources * Electric car startup Singulato may be an initial client -sources By Norihiko Shirouzu BEIJING, July 23 (Reuters) - In China, where the future of the car is looking more and more electric, newcomers to the auto industry are looking for partners to help them build their vehicles. Enter Canadian auto supplier Magna International which aims to spearhead a shift to contract vehicle manufacturing through its new partnership with state-owned Chinese carmaker BAIC Group. According to five people familiar with the matter, their joint venture is likely to build vehicles for ride-hailing giant Didi Chuxing and possibly Chinese electric car startup Singulato Motors, in addition to BAIC’s electric unit BJEV. The venture has yet to disclose talks with Didi and Singulato. The Magna-BAIC deal, announced in June, realises a long-held dream of Magna Steyr, the supplier’s Austrian unit and the world’s biggest player in the still niche business of contract car assembly, to expand beyond Europe. It could also portend the rise of an ‘automotive Foxconn’ for electric cars - an idea discussed by industry executives for years. Given EVs’ low volumes compared to traditional models, it makes sense for some firms to outsource assembly in the same way Apple Inc and other tech companies do with Taiwan’s Foxconn, formally known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd . The time is ripe for such a development in China, some experts say.

Turin-based Olsa supplies lighting products to car makers such as Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE and BMW BMWG.DE. “Lighting represents a growth area for Magna due to increasing levels of electronics integration and a desire for automakers to differentiate their vehicles through styling,” John O’Hara, president of Magna Lighting, said. Magna will have a total of 11 lighting manufacturing facilities after the Olsa deal, which is expected to close by the end of 2018. Earlier this month, Magna said it would set up two joint ventures with Beijing Electric Vehicle Co to build electric cars in China."

-15.595079251845956," UPDATE 2-Magna cautiously optimistic about NAFTA; raises profit forecast (Adds CEO and CFO remarks from AGM, stock price) May 10 (Reuters) - Magna International’s chief executive said on Thursday he was “cautiously optimistic” that talks to renegotiate NAFTA would result in a competitive trade deal, after the Canadian auto parts maker raised its full-year sales and profit forecasts. Canadian, Mexican and U.S. officials have been locked in intense negotiations for more than eight months to modernize the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) but rules around automotive industry content have emerged as a key sticking point. To be exempt from duties, the U.S. has argued that autos should be composed of 75 percent North American auto content, up from the current 62.5 percent. While a higher North American content would benefit Magna as the region’s largest auto parts supplier, negotiators must also weigh carmakers’ needs, CEO Don Walker said. “In theory, Magna is the biggest beneficiary because we’re the biggest supplier here,” he said. “But if it goes too high, that means the car companies say I can’t meet it.” Walker told the company’s annual general meeting in Ontario that he was “cautiously optimistic” the talks would lead to a deal “that’s not too bureaucratic” and “keeps NAFTA competitive.” Earlier, Magna reported higher-than-expected quarterly profit and raised its full-year sales target to $40.9 billion to $43.1 billion, up from its previous forecast range of $39.3 billion to $41.5 billion. It forecast 2018 net income of $2.4 billion-$2.6 billion, slightly higher than its previous projection of $2.3 billion-$2.5 billion. The company expects more than $6 billion in free cash flow between 2018 and 2020 amid higher revenues and lower capital expenditures, Magna Chief Financial Officer Vince Galifi said. Magna shares were up 3.8 percent at C$81.13 in afternoon trading, while the benchmark Canada share index was up 0.5 percent. The stock has risen 13.6 percent this year, compared with a 1.8 percent fall in the benchmark index in the same period. Magna expects to grow sales faster than vehicle production through 2020 as it launches new programs, such as its autonomous car agreement with Lyft, even as demand is expected to soften in the key North American market this year. Sales at the business that assembles cars under contract from manufacturers rose more than three-fold to $1.66 billion in the first quarter ended March 31.
