41.74467960834309," Hess tapped to market Guyana oil as search for partner continues (Reuters) - U.S. oil producer Hess Corp has been selected to market two Guyana crude oil shipments as the emerging oil power seeks a permanent partner to handle its share of a major offshore oil find, the country’s vice president said on Tuesday. The South American country has became an oil hotspot after a consortium led by Exxon Mobil Corp discovered more than 8 billion barrels of oil and gas off its coast. Guyana receives a portion of the consortium’s output, which it then sells. But with no domestic refining nor state oil company, Guyana relies on private companies to market its share. President Irfaan Ali’s government re-launched an advanced search for that partner after taking power last year, receiving 29 bids in October. “The evaluation criteria we believe was set by the Department (of Energy) resulted in the evaluators having to disqualify 28 of the 29,” Guyana Vice President Bharrat Jagdeo told reporters on Tuesday, blaming “nonsensical” criteria inherited from the prior government, without elaborating. The only bidder to meet the formula was a unit of Russian oil firm Lukoil, he said, meaning a selection would not have been “competitive.” Instead, Guyana asked Hess, Exxon and China’s CNOOC Ltd - members of the consortium operating the Stabroek offshore block - to submit bids to lift crude from the Liza Destiny floating production storage and offloading (FPSO) facility. Hess presented the “best terms,” Jagdeo said. A Hess spokesman declined to comment, citing a practice of not publicly discussing commercial arrangements. Exxon also declined to comment and CNOOC did not immediately reply to requests for comment. Lukoil did not respond to a request for comment sent after business hours in Moscow. Guyana’s government had marketed its first three shipments through a short-term deal with Royal Dutch Shell."
26.31277346178736," UPDATE 2-Hess Corp posts smaller quarterly loss on fuel demand recovery (Adds estimates, analyst comment, background) Jan 27 (Reuters) - Hess Corp reported a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss on Wednesday, as the U.S. oil and gas producer kept a tight lid on costs and helped by higher gas prices and a recovery in crude demand from the hit caused by the coronavirus. Easing of COVID-19 related restrictions has propelled oil demand and prices, which remain stable since a late-2020 rebound from historic lows. Brent crude, which averaged at $45 per barrel in the last quarter of 2020, rose above $56 on Wednesday. Despite the rise in crude prices, oil producers have so far largely refused to raise production too quickly, aiding prices for natural gas - largely a byproduct of oil drilling. Hess’ realized crude oil selling price, including hedges, of $45.32 per barrel in the fourth quarter was slightly lower than the third, but its selling prices for natural gas and natural gas liquids improved by double digit percentages. The company’s total production of 309,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) was 3.7% below the third quarter but beat estimates of 302,000 boepd, according to Credit Suisse analysts. “Hess printed a better quarter than what the Street expected, both on production and realizations after hedging,” said Ethan Bellamy, managing director of midstream strategy at East Daley Capital Advisors. “It’s a positive sign for HES shares as their risk management program really paid off this quarter, more so than what the Street anticipated,” he added. Hess earlier this week forecast net production, excluding Libya, of 310,000 boepd for this year, a dip of 5% compared with 2020 estimate, partly hit by turnaround activity at the Tioga Gas Plant in the Bakken region. On an adjusted basis, the company posted a loss of 58 cents per share in the fourth quarter, smaller than analysts’ average expectation of a loss of 66 cents per share, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

17.810841259274255," UPDATE 2-Oil Producer Hess expects dip in 2021 output (Adds details on allocation of budget, production) Jan 25 (Reuters) - Oil and gas producer Hess Corp on Monday forecast a small drop in output and set a $1.9 billion budget for 2021, most of which will go to Guyana, touted as one of the most important new oil and gas discoveries in the last decade. The company has been relying on its investment in offshore Guyana, one of the world’s most important oil and gas blocks in the last decade, which is being developed by a consortium led by oil major Exxon Mobil Corp . Hess has allotted $780 million, or 41% of its budget, to development activities in offshore Guyana. “We also will continue to invest in an active exploration and appraisal program, with 12-15 wells planned on the Stabroek Block (offshore Guyana),” said Chief Operating Officer Greg Hill. Hess forecast net production to average about 310,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) in 2021, excluding Libya, compared with 2020 estimate of 325,000 boepd. For 2020, the New York-based energy company had estimated to spend $1.8 billion. The company will also add a rig in the first quarter in North Dakota’s Bakken shale play, adding to a single rig there since May. There were six rigs in the Bakken at the start of last year before the company slashed production to cope with a oil price crash. Bakken net production is estimated to average about 170,000 boepd in 2021, which despite the addition of a rig, would be below 2020’s estimated 190,000 boepd, partly hit by a planned 45-day turnaround activity at the Tioga Gas Plant in the third quarter cutting output by about 7,500 boepd in 2021.

55.448143749978705," Hess posts bigger-than-expected loss, cuts annual production forecast (Reuters) - Hess Corp HES.N reported a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss on Wednesday and cut its full-year production forecast as hurricanes disrupted the oil and gas producer's operations in the Gulf of Mexico. Intense hurricane activity in the region over the last few months has forced companies to shut down their production platforms, curtailing output. Hess said it was expecting 2020 production, excluding Libya, of around 325,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), below its prior estimate of 330,000. Current-quarter production forecast of 300,000 boepd, excluding Libya, was below analysts’ estimates of 323,000 boepd, due to the hit from hurricanes as well as a slower ramp up at a key well offshore Guyana. The company said it was expecting its Liza I well off the coast of Guyana to reach full capacity of 120,000 gross barrels of oil per day (bpd) only in December. It had previously expected to reach full capacity in August. However, the company raised the estimate of discovered recoverable resources at its Stabroek Block, offshore Guyana, by about 1 billion barrels of oil equivalent (boe) to about 9 billion. Hess, which also has operation in North Dakota’s Bakken shale play, said it had no plans for mergers and acquisitions in the near term. “We see nothing in the M&A market that will compete for capital against our existing portfolio,” Chief Executive Officer John Hess said. Hess’s comment comes against the backdrop of a string of takeover deals announced in recent weeks as shale companies look to consolidation to survive the pandemic-driven downturn. The company posted a third-quarter loss of 71 cents per share, bigger than analysts’ estimate of 67 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Quarterly production, excluding Libya, rose 10.7% to 321,000 boepd, while average realized price for crude, excluding hedges, fell 35.3% to $36.17 per barrel."

The company also cut its exploration and production budget for the year to $1.8 billion from its original estimate of $1.9 billion. The oil producer’s shares fell 2.8% to $36.37 in premarket trading. Hess and its peers have this year lowered capital spending as part of larger cost cutting moves in the hopes of keeping their expenses in check as they try to cope with record plunges in crude prices due to the pandemic through March and April. Brent was trading at $39.58 per barrel and is down about 40% this year. The New York-based company said its total production, excluding Libya, rose 10.7% to 321,000 barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) per day, partly due to contribution from the Liza field in Guyana which came online in December 2019. Average selling price for the company’s crude oil fell to $36.17 per barrel. Excluding items, the company reported a loss of 71 cents per share, wider than analysts’ average estimate of 67 cents per share, according to Refinitiv IBES data.

30.63248451521622," U.S., Guyana to launch joint maritime patrols near disputed Venezuela border GEORGETOWN/CARACAS (Reuters) - The United States and Guyana will begin joint maritime patrols aimed at drug interdiction near the South American country’s disputed border with crisis-stricken Venezuela, the U.S. secretary of state and Guyana’s new president said on Friday. The agreement comes as U.S. oil major Exxon Mobil Corp, as part of a consortium with Hess Corp and China’s CNOOC Ltd, ramps up crude output from Guyana’s massive offshore Stabroek block, a large portion of which is in waters claimed by Venezuela. “Greater security, greater capacity to understand your border space, what’s happening inside your Exclusive Economic Zone - those are all things that give Guyana sovereignty,” U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a joint appearance with newly-installed Guyanese President Irfaan Ali. Pompeo is using his four-nation South America tour to ramp up pressure on Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, who has overseen a six-year economic collapse and has been indicted in the United States on narcoterrorism charges, to resign. “We know that the Maduro regime has decimated the people of Venezuela and that Maduro himself is an indicted narcotics trafficker. That means he has to leave,” Pompeo told reporters during his appearance in Georgetown with Ali. Maduro, who remains in power despite Washington’s 18-month campaign of economic sanctions and diplomatic pressure, said Pompeo was “bothering the region.” “Mike Pompeo is calling for war against Venezuela, but he has failed,” Maduro said in a state television address later on Friday. The latest salvo in a century-long border dispute between Guyana and Venezuela that is currently being evaluated at the International Court of Justice came in late 2018, when Venezuela’s navy intercepted a vessel conducting a seismic survey on Exxon’s behalf. A series of offshore oil discoveries in recent years have given Guyana, which has no history of oil production, the potential to become one of Latin America’s largest producers. “We have had various difficulties and I think we welcome any help that would enhance our security, that would enhance our ability to protect our borders,” Ali said."
15.877482630373299," Hess CEO 'optimistic' new Guyana government will approve project license (Reuters) - Hess Corp's HES.N chief executive on Wednesday said he is optimistic the recently elected government of Guyana will issue by the end of September a production license for the third phase of a major offshore oil project. The South American nation has become one of the most important new oil and gas discoveries in the last decade, with more than 8 billion barrels of oil and gas, and is a bright spot for an industry dealing with demand loss due to the pandemic. Hess and partners Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N and CNOOC Ltd 0883.HK are in ""close communication"" with officials, John Hess said at a virtual presentation to the Barclays CEO Energy-Power conference. Government approval of the Payara project this month would keep it on track for producing oil in 2023, Hess said. Exxon, which leads the consortium, previously said that delaying government approvals for sending a third vessel needed to start offshore production could postpone the startup by six to 12 months. Production in the first phase of the Liza project in Guyana will reach full capacity of 120,000 barrels per day in coming weeks, Hess said. It delivered its first oil last December. The partners on Tuesday said they had made their 18th discovery offshore Guyana, but did not outline development plans or estimate how much additional oil would be recoverable. Guyana is a key part of growth plans for Exxon and Hess, and both have said they would prioritize spending there as they pull back elsewhere. Current international oil prices around $40 a barrel do “not work for investing in increasing supply in the oil industry,” Hess said. “Obviously, one of the few exceptions to that is Guyana.” Hess has pulled back to operating one drilling rig in the Bakken shale field in the United States and will consider “gradually adding” when oil reaches $50 per barrel, Hess said."

10.006842300640548," Exxon presses for government approval of third Guyana oil project GEORGETOWN/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp is pressing Guyana’s newly-installed government for approval of its third offshore oil project, which has been under a months-long review that coincided with political turmoil in the South American country. Exxon, which operates the Stabroek block as part of a consortium with Hess Corp and China’s CNOOC Ltd, has discovered more than 8 billion barrels of recoverable resource of Guyana’s coast. It had previously stated it planned to make a final investment decision on the Payara project around September. After taking office in early August after a months-long recount of a disputed March election, Guyanese President Irfaan Ali appointed a team of Canadian consultants, including former Alberta premier Alison Redford, to review Exxon’s proposal to develop the field. “The timely approval of additional proposed projects, including Payara, will ensure that the local workforce and the utilization of local suppliers will continue to grow,” Exxon’s new country head in Guyana, Alistair Routledge, said in a Wednesday statement. Exxon initially planned for the project to come online in 2023 but has warned it could be delayed. During the campaign, Ali criticized the Production Sharing Agreement (PSA) his predecessor signed with Exxon - which included a 2% royalty and 50% profit share - as too generous. He has pledged to enact stricter rules requiring the company to use more local content and hire more Guyanese labor. In an interview with Reuters, Ali declined to go into details about which particular parts of Exxon’s proposed Payara development plan were under scrutiny. “There has to be a comprehensive review,” Ali said. “We have to look at international best practices, we have to look at some of the best PSAs around, we have to look at what we have - the gap - and then in the review come up with possible scenarios.” (The story corrects spelling of Alistair Routledge)"

Energy companies have slashed spending and production as petroleum prices have dropped 31% this year. A sharp decline in fuel demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic has oil companies girding for a prolonged period of weak prices. Hess, which had about 1,770 employees as of Dec. 31, dismissed about 165 full-time workers this week and terminated an undisclosed number of contract employees, according to people familiar with the matter. A spokesperson declined immediate comment. It has pared spending on new projects this year by more than $1 billion from its initial plan.

-25.207674891204984," Hess posts smaller-than-expected loss on higher output, lower costs (Reuters) - U.S. oil and gas producer Hess Corp reported a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss on Wednesday, as higher output and lower costs helped offset a plunge in oil prices due to the coronavirus crisis, sending its shares 3% higher. Crude prices sank to historic lows in April as demand plummeted due to the COVID-19 pandemic and a price war between the world’s top producers flooded the market with oil. Hess said the average selling price of its crude oil, including hedging, fell 35.4% in the second quarter to $39.03 a barrel. The slump in prices, however, was cushioned by a 22% jump in production to 334,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), as output rose at its Bakken field in North Dakota and Liza Field, offshore Guyana. Hess did not curtail production during the downturn and instead charted three very large crude carriers (VLCC) to store its crude. The company plans to load an additional 2.3 million barrels of crude on the vessels in the third quarter. It also raised its full-year production forecast, excluding Libya, by 10,000 boepd to about 330,000 boepd, as it increased the number of active wells in the Bakken and delayed the planned maintenance of its Tioga Gas Plant in North Dakota to 2021 from the third quarter. The outlook raise is not a surprise given the delay in maintenance, but will likely be an outlier in the current environment, Credit Suisse analysts said. Its quarterly total costs and expenses fell over 27% to $1.1 billion. Net loss attributable was $320 million, or $1.05 per share, in the quarter ended June 30, compared with a loss of $6 million, or 2 cents per share, a year earlier.

14.880107539480713," Hess sees no production shut-ins on hedges, storage capacity (Reuters) - Hess Corp does not plan to shut-in production despite the recent slump in U.S. crude prices as it has hedged its output and chartered vessels to store its crude, the U.S. oil and gas producer said on Thursday. Stay-at-home orders designed to contain the coronavirus pandemic have forced businesses to shut down, cutting worldwide demand for oil and creating a supply glut. U.S. crude collapsed last month to an unprecedented -$38, and remains about 60% lower from January’s levels despite a recent rally. Hess has chartered three very large crude-oil carriers to store 2 million barrels each of May, June and July Bakken crude oil production that is expected to be sold in the fourth quarter and said it had hedged those barrels. The company said that in 2020 about 80% of its production is hedged with put options for 130,000 barrels per day at $55 per barrel West Texas intermediate (WTI) crude, and 20,000 barrels per day at $60 per barrel Brent. Hess on Thursday also deepened its spending cuts after reporting a quarterly loss due to impairment charges of $2.25 billion. It slashed 2020 capital budget by 37% to $1.9 billion and trimmed full-year oil and gas production forecast, excluding Libya, to about 320,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), 4% lower than the mid-point of its original guidance. The reduction will be achieved by cutting rig numbers from six to one in the Bakken play and reducing 2020 drilling activity on the Stabroek Block offshore Guyana. This is the second time the company has reduced its full-year capital spending and production outlook. New York-based Hess said net loss attributable was $2.43 billion, or $8 per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, compared with a profit of $32 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier. However, on an adjusted per share basis, it incurred a loss of 60 cents, smaller than the average analyst estimate of a loss of 65 cents, according to Refinitiv IBES. Total production, excluding Libya, rose 23.7% to 344,000 boepd in the quarter, thanks to a 46% jump in Bakken production and the first full quarter of production at the Liza Field, offshore Guyana. For the second quarter, Hess expects net production to be in the range of 310,000 boepd to 315,000 boepd, excluding Libya.

65.48272631514138," Hess, Concho, Callon join Exxon in tightening budget amid oil crash (Reuters) - U.S. producers Hess Corp, Concho Resources Inc and Callon Petroleum Co on Tuesday followed oil major Exxon Mobil Corp in cutting their spending for the year, as oil prices continued to trade below $30 a barrel. Oil producers are trying to shore up cash as a double-whammy from the Saudi-Russia price war and dwindling demand because of the coronavirus outbreak threatens to hold oil prices hostage for an uncertain period of time. Prices fell below $30 per barrel on Tuesday, extending losses after shedding a tenth of their value on Monday, while most shale producers need oil prices at low $40s to make a profit. In a major reversal from just a few weeks ago, oil major Exxon said on Monday it would make “significant” cuts to spending in the face of the price slide that has sent its shares to a 17-year low. Chevron Corp earlier said it was looking at ways to trim spending that could lead to lower near-term oil production. It originally expected 2020 organic capital expenditure of $20 billion. Hess, Concho and Callon slashed their 2020 capital budget by about a quarter while Callon said it would cut its rig count to five from nine before the end of the second quarter. Hess also lowered its 2020 average production by 1.5% to between 325,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) and 330,000 boepd, excluding Libya.

-19.117230865559456," Shale pioneer John Hess says key U.S. fields starting to plateau HOUSTON (Reuters) - Shale pioneer John Hess said on Tuesday that key U.S. shale fields are starting to plateau, calling shale “important but not the next Saudi Arabia.” Over the past decade, the shale revolution turned the United States into the world’s largest crude producer and a force in energy exports. Yet that did not translate to higher stock prices or returns for investors, with the S&P 500 Energy sector only gaining 6% in a decade, far less than the 180% return for the broader stock market. Companies remain under pressure to trim budgets and produce enough free cash flow to pay investors higher dividends or buy back shares. The biggest industry challenge is the lack of long-term investment, Hess said. Production in the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas is starting to plateau, while the Bakken field in North Dakota where Hess is a major producer will hit its peak production levels within the next two years, said Hess, who spoke Tuesday in Houston at the Argus Americas Crude Summit. The Permian Basin, the top U.S. shale field in Texas and New Mexico, will plateau in mid-decade and is already facing well interference issues, Hess said. That means the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries will continue to act as the “Federal Reserve of oil,” he said. Hess plans to use cash flow from the Bakken to invest in longer-term offshore investments. The company is relying on offshore Guyana, one of the world's most important oil and gas discoveries in the last decade, which is being developed by a consortium led by oil major Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N. In the Bakken, Hess said the company expects to reach 200,000 barrels per day of production next year. It would then sideline two of its six drilling rigs in the field for several years to hold production steady. In the short term, “the oil market is awash in oil right now, in part because of panic created by the coronavirus,” Hess said. “It’s a major headwind.” The industry also has to respond to the threat of climate change, Hess said. “Climate change is real,” he said, “but how do we deal with it?” The world will need technological breakthroughs and faces the dual challenge of needing to “decarbonize liquid fuel and make the electric grid stable when it’s dependent on intermittent renewable energy,” he added."

-14.58671968188596," Hess posts bigger-than-expected quarterly loss on natgas hit (Reuters) - Hess Corp HES.N reported a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss on Wednesday, as lower prices for its natural gas and natural gas liquids more than offset higher output from its Bakken shale assets in North Dakota. Shares fell 7% to $57.73 in afternoon trading. Natural gas prices have hovered near two-decade lows as a long and steady increase in U.S. production due to the shale oil boom has led to ample supplies. Hess said average selling prices for natural gas fell 27.8% and natural gas liquids slumped 34.5% in the fourth quarter. The extended weak prices have forced Chevron Corp CVX.N, Range Resources RRC.N and EQT Corp EQT.N to warn of impairments on their gas-producing assets. Hess said it expects to spend $3 billion in 2020, compared with $2.74 billion last year, as it bets big on Bakken and offshore Guyana, which has emerged as one of the most important oil and gas discoveries of the last decade. The company is part of a consortium led by oil major Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N and has forecast total recoverable oil and gas resources of more than 8 billion barrels in offshore Guyana. The higher budget comes as the U.S. shale industry has reined in spending under pressure to produce higher shareholder returns. “Investors are worried that the losses that they incur in 2020 might be as big, if not bigger, than 2019,” said Bill Selesky, a senior analyst at Argus Research, adding they are also concerned about Hess’ higher spending in 2020. Hess expects net production in Guyana to average about 25,000 barrels of oil per day for 2020, while it estimates net production in Bakken to average about 180,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d).

-28.13936149669069," Oil producer Hess boosts 2020 spending on Guyana, Bakken ramp-up (Reuters) - U.S. oil and gas producer Hess Corp said it would spend 11% more in 2020 compared with last year, betting heavily on its assets in offshore Guyana and the Bakken shale play. The company said its 2020 exploration and production capital and exploratory budget will be $3 billion, higher than the estimated $2.7 billion allocated for 2019. The company said it would allocate $1.69 billion for production, $860 million for offshore Guyana developments and $450 million for exploration and appraisal activities. Hess has been relying on its investment in offshore Guyana, one of the world’s most important oil and gas blocks in the last decade, which is being developed by a consortium led by oil major Exxon Mobil Corp. The partnership recently boosted Guyana oil estimates by 2 billion barrels, bringing total recoverable oil and gas resources to more than 8 billion barrels. The company expects net production, excluding Libya, to average between 330,000 and 335,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d) in 2020 compared with the 285,000 boe/d it expects for 2019. “We are well positioned to deliver industry leading cash flow growth while also achieving significant reductions in our unit costs, which will drive margin expansion and lower our breakeven oil price to below $40 per barrel Brent by 2025,” said Chief Executive Officer John Hess in a statement. Hess is expected to report its fourth-quarter results and its spending in 2019 on Wednesday."

-35.46550936285534," Exxon, Hess to export first oil from Guyana in early 2020: sources (Reuters) - U.S. producers Exxon Mobil Corp and Hess Corp plan to export the first-ever shipments of crude oil from Guyana between January and February, a milestone for Latin America’s newest oil producer, sources with knowledge of the plans said. A consortium including both companies and a unit of China’s CNOOC Ltd have so far discovered more than 6 billion barrels of recoverable oil and gas resources off Guyana’s coast, which could eventually produce 750,000 barrels per day (bpd) for a country that has no history of crude output. Those finds are turning Guyana, an impoverished nation bordering longtime producers Venezuela and Brazil, into a hot property for oil investment. Exxon’s Guyana spokeswoman last week told Reuters that “key activities” on its giant Stabroek block, including early production, were running ahead of schedule. He said that coming weeks would be critical as progress could be impacted by weather and other factors. The U.S. company did not provide additional details. Hess declined to comment. CNOOC and Guyana’s government were not immediately available for comment. Liza will be the first Guyanese crude grade produced and offered to the oil market. It has 32 API degrees of density and 0.5 percent of sulfur content, according to Exxon’s assay seen by Reuters. Exxon is planning on shipping two 1-million-barrel cargoes of Liza crude in January, to be followed by similarly sized shipments from Hess and Guyana’s government in February. Exxon plans to process the oil at its refineries, while Hess could offer it for spot sales. CNOOC, which has not yet scheduled exports, would ship it to China, whose refiners like using similar medium sweet grades, the sources said. Interested buyers are exploring options to co-load Liza crude with other South American crudes bound for Asia, mainly Brazilian grades. Starting in March, very large crude carriers (VLCCs) could lift up to 2 million barrels each, depending on weather conditions, the sources added. “We are expecting Liza to be traded at $4-$6 over Brent crude prices during the first three months of exports. First buyers would test it, and then prices could go up a little,” a trader interested in purchases said. The Liza project is expected to produce up to 120,000 bpd of oil in 2020-2022 and reach 750,000 bpd by 2025. Exxon had initially planned first production to come in early 2020, but in November it said it could be available in December. Exxon and its partners have made 14 large discoveries at the Stabroek block since 2015."

The results come a day after shale player Concho Resources Inc CXO.N posted adjusted earnings that more than halved on the back of tumbling prices. Hess said average prices for crude, including hedging, fell more than 15% in the third quarter, while it dropped 7% for natural gas. Global oil prices fell in the third quarter on oversupply and demand concerns fueled by the U.S.-China trade war and its impact on the global economy. Oil and gas net production rose to an average of 290,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), excluding Libya, from 279,000 boepd a year earlier. The increased production was driven by a 38% jump in Bakken output that partially offset the hit from hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico.The higher output at Bakken also prompted the company to raise its full-year net production guidance to about 285,000 boepd, from 275,000 boepd to 280,000 boepd it forecast earlier. Hess also cut its 2019 capital expenditure by $100 million to $2.7 billion.

1.8043964111638229," Hess posts smaller-than-expected loss, raises production forecast (Reuters) - Hess Corp HES.N reported a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss on Wednesday, helped by lower exploration costs and a surge in output in its Bakken shale and Gulf of Mexico assets that also prompted the company to raise its 2019 production forecast. The company also cut its full-year spending plans by $100 million to $2.8 billion against the backdrop of increased investor pressure to boost shareholder returns. Hess' shares rose 6.3%, the second-biggest percentage gainer on the S&P 500 Energy Index .SPNY. Oil output in the United States has soared in recent years, powered by the shale revolution, which has made it the world’s largest oil producer, ahead of Saudi Arabia and Russia. Investors are also betting on Hess' investment in offshore Guyana, where it is working with oil major Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N. Commercial production is expected to begin in 2020, and output could reach 750,000 barrels per day. Hess raised the lower end of its 2019 production forecast by 5,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) to 275,000 boepd, while leaving the top end unchanged at 280,000 boepd. The company said it expects net production to average between 270,000 and 280,000 boepd, excluding Libya, in the third quarter. Hess expects a ramp up in output from the prolific Bakken field to be partially offset by planned maintenance at one of its Southeast Asia assets and the impact of Hurricane Barry in the Gulf of Mexico in early July. Raymond James analyst Muhammed Ghulam said investors should see the production and capex changes as “slight positives”. Total production, excluding Libya, jumped more than 10% to 273,000 boepd in the second quarter ended June 30, with output at Bakken jumping about 23% and Gulf Of Mexico surging 38.3%. The company achieved the higher output while reining in costs. Cash operating costs dropped 9.4% to $12.11 per boe in the latest quarter. Investors, frustrated with low returns from the energy sector despite years of spending, have been pressing oil and gas producers to shore up cash, rather than drill new wells.

19.409909569398415," Hess production tops estimates on Bakken, Gulf of Mexico strength (Reuters) - Oil and gas producer Hess Corp’s fourth-quarter production beat Wall Street estimates on Wednesday, driven by higher output from the Bakken shale region and the Gulf of Mexico. Total production for the quarter ended Dec. 31, excluding its Libyan operations, was 267,000 barrels of oil equivalents per day (boe/d), while analysts were expecting 265,000 boe/d, according to Wells Fargo Securities. The United States has overtaken Russia and Saudi Arabia to become the world’s biggest crude producer with daily output approaching 12 million barrels. Hess’s average selling prices, excluding hedging, rose to $58.11 per barrel in the fourth quarter, from $57.32 per barrel a year-ago. On a conference call with analysts, Chief Financial Officer John Rielly said for the year 2019, Hess had hedged 95,000 barrels of oil per day at $60 for U.S. light crude. New York-based Hess said it was expecting a yearly compound production growth of more than 10 percent through 2025, and will be able to break even on production even if Brent crude trades at less than $40 per barrel. Brent crude, currently trading at $61.95, fell some 35 percent in the fourth quarter. Hess stuck to its plan of spending $2.9 billion in 2019, up 38 percent from its projected spending plan for 2018. The company plans to spend most of that money on oil discoveries in offshore Guyana, where it is working on a project with Exxon Mobil Corp, as well as in the Bakken region.

11.104098802509089," Hess Corp sees oil output growing 10 percent per year through 2025 HOUSTON (Reuters) - Hess Corp said on Wednesday it expects oil and gas output to grow more than 10 percent a year compounded through 2025, touting development of its Bakken shale and offshore Guyana projects. The company projects higher margins will drive compound annual cash flow growth of 20 percent through 2025, it said ahead of a meeting with Wall Street investors. Hess shrugged off a recent dip in oil prices and said it was moving from growth and investment mode to where its major assets will start producing free cash flow. “We are at a transformative inflection point,” Chief Executive John Hess said during the investor meeting, broadcast over the internet. Hess boosted the production forecast for its Bakken shale field in North Dakota to 200,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) by 2021, from 175,000 boepd. The shale acreage, the jewel in the crown of the company’s onshore production, will produce $5 billion in free cash flow between 2019 and 2025. Hess expects the first production from the offshore Guyana discovery to be tapped in 2020, and said the region had the potential to produce more than 750,000 boepd by 2025. Hess is working with Exxon Mobil Corp on fields projected to hold up to 5 billion barrels of recoverable oil and gas. Guyana through 2025 will generate $4 billion free cash flow for Hess, said Greg Hill, president and chief operating officer. The New York-based company earlier this week set a 2019 capital budget of $2.9 billion, up 38 percent from this year’s projected spending plan. The budget reflects “peak” spending for the first phase of offshore Guyana oil discoveries. Hess plans to keep capital spending flat around $3 billion annually through 2025 and will be able to return money to shareholders in, “any type of price environment,” said Chief Financial Officer John Rielly. Investors for a year have pressured oil and gas producers to rein in spending and instead focus on profits. Companies are starting to disclose their 2019 budgets, which generally are released in December and January. Hess will complete a $1.5 billion share repurchase program by the end of the year. It does not plan additional share buybacks now, but if profits exceed expectations, a “priority would be more share buybacks,” Hess said. Hess stock was down a fraction at $51.74 a share on Wednesday. The stock is up about 12 percent year to date."

9.145656631179547," Oil producers Hess, Conoco raise 2019 production outlooks (Reuters) - Hess Corp and ConocoPhillips expect to produce more oil in 2019 than last year without altering their exploration budget in a big way, the two oil and gas producers said on Monday. Conoco will spend more on Alaska and Canada than before in the next year, while keeping expenses in continental United States, which includes the costly and crowded Permian Basin, largely unchanged. Pipelines in the basin are running at full capacity, while unprecedented drilling has resulted in labor shortage. Conoco said it will spend $1.2 billion on Alaska from its total capital expenditure of $6.1 billion in 2019, partly a result of a recently sanctioned oil project there. In 2018, the company expects to spend less than $1 billion in the region. Meanwhile, Hess said the lion’s share of its $2.9 billion capital expenditure in 2019 will be used for exploration in Guyana and in the Bakken shale region of eastern Montana and western North Dakota. The company’s spending in Guyana largely focuses on production from its offshore discoveries in partnership with Exxon Mobil that now total more than 5 billion barrels of oil equivalent per day (boep/d). The raised production forecasts come as global oil markets struggle with oversupply, resulting in producer group OPEC and other key exporters agreeing to cut their crude output from January. U.S. production, however, is expected to rise to a record high of 10.9 million bpd in 2018 and 12.1 million bpd in 2019. For Hess, production is expected to range between 270,000 and 280,000 boep/d, excluding Libya, up from the 255,000 boep/d it expects in 2018, while ConocoPhillips was aiming to produce 2.0-2.6 percent more oil and gas next year. “As we focus spending on our high return investment opportunities, we will continue to reduce our unit costs to drive margin expansion and improve profitability,” Hess Corp Chief Executive Officer John Hess said in a statement. Last week, oil major Chevron Corp increased its spending budget for the first time in four years. The company said it plans to spend more on shale production next year, as well as in refining and chemicals."

While the company sold assets in Thailand and Indonesia a few years ago as it saw little growth in those two countries, Southeast Asia still plays a key role in its portfolio, said Greg Hill, president and chief operating officer of Hess. “We have 20 years of investment opportunities that have provided good stable cash flow for us,” said Hill on the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Petroleum Conference (APPEC) in Singapore. “But Malaysia, we supply 25 percent of peninsular Malaysia gas ... It’s a key core holding for us and we have no interest in selling Southeast Asia (assets),” he said. Hess has a collection of gas fields in the North Malay Basin offshore Malaysia and in the Malaysia-Thailand Joint Development Area as a 50 percent equal partner with Petronas [PETR.UL]. Reuters reported last month that the Southeast Asian offshore gas assets of Hess, estimated to be worth as much as $5 billion, have attracted takeover interest from firms including Thailand’s PTTEP PCL and Austrian energy group OMV AG, citing people familiar with the matter. OMV, which was one of the candidates to buy Hess assets in Malaysia, instead bought into Malaysia’s Sapura Energy. In 2014, Hess sold its Thai assets to PTTEP for $1 billion, and its Indonesian assets to state-owned gas utility PGN for $650 million.

-12.530128010457378," Exclusive: U.S. energy group Hess Corp's SE Asia assets attract bid interest - sources SINGAPORE (Reuters) - The Southeast Asian offshore natural gas assets of U.S. oil and gas producer Hess Corp HES.N, estimated to be worth as much as $5 billion, have attracted takeover interest from firms including Thailand's PTTEP PCL PTTEP.BK and Austrian energy group OMV AG OMVV.VI, people familiar with the matter said. Hess, which has a collection of gas fields in North Malay Basin in offshore Malaysia and in the Malaysia-Thailand Joint Development Area (JDA) with 50 percent equal partner Petronas, has not yet decided whether to sell the assets, according to financial and industry sources. Their estimated market value would be about $4 billion to $5 billion, the sources said. They declined to be identified because the takeover interest had not previously been made public. The interest in Hess’ assets, among the few long-term and sizeable projects in the region, comes as cashed-up firms such as PTTEP are buying overseas assets, while the likes of OMV and Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Company have been scouring for acquisitions in Asia.. Hess, which hasn’t reported a profit since 2014, has been under pressure from investors to make money. It posted a smaller-than-expected loss in April-June, but many of its peers have turned profitable after the oil price crash two years ago, fuelling questions as to why Hess has not followed suit. The firm is developing large offshore oil projects in South America and U.S. shale oil. In 2014, it sold its Thai assets to PTTEP for $1 billion and also sold its Indonesian assets. “We don’t comment on rumours but we continue to believe that our Malaysia assets are an important part of our portfolio and our value creation strategy,” Hess spokeswoman Lorrie Hecker said in a statement. “JDA and North Malay Basin are significant long-term, low-cost cash generators, producing stable production and free cash flows, which provide funding for our compelling, long-term opportunities in Guyana and the Bakken (in the United States).” ‘TEAMS WORKING ON THIS’ “A number of parties have looked (at the Hess assets) and have teams working on this,” said one financial source. “Increasing numbers of companies believe a sale is probable,” said the person, adding that Hess’ project would also appeal to private-equity backed players and mid-sized energy firms. He said PTTEP was working with a financial advisor for its interest in the assets. Another source said some parties had done preliminary work on the assets and were waiting to see if Hess would start a sale process. OMV and Kuwait Foreign Petroleum Exploration Company declined to comment. This month, OMV won regulatory approval to buy Royal Dutch Shell's RDSa.L upstream assets in New Zealand for $578 million. OMV said in March that the acquisition was a key step to develop Australasia into a core region in line with its new strategy. Petronas declined comment while PTTEP said it was focused on expanding in Southeast Asia. “PTTEP is interested in M&A deals with particular focus on assets located in PTTEP’s region of experience such as South East Asia, which is PTTEP’s areas of expertise and the operating risk is moderately low,” the Thai company told Reuters, declining to comment specifically on Hess assets. The industry's prospects have brightened as oil LCOc1 and natural gas LNG-AS prices have more than doubled since early 2016, with demand for oil in Asia - the world's biggest consumer - also growing strongly even as production is falling faster than anywhere else. Hess’ nine gas fields in the North Malay Basin have an estimated gross recoverable resource of more than 1.5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and over 20 million barrels of condensate. Production started in July 2017. The company has a 50 percent working interest in the Southeast Asian blocks with Petronas Carigali, a fully-owned subsidiary of Petronas. Hess signed a production-sharing contract with Petronas in 2012 and has a contract with the oil major till 2029. “Hess is pursuing divestments globally, high grading its portfolio centered around its Guyana and U.S. Bakken (shale) interests,” said Saul Kavonic, director of Asia/Pacific markets and head of energy research in Australia at Credit Suisse."
-8.728541631693053," Hess loss shrinks as higher oil prices offset falling output (Reuters) - U.S. oil and gas producer Hess Corp posted a smaller-than-expected quarterly loss on Wednesday, as higher crude prices offset an unexpected drop in production. New York-based Hess, which has not reported a profit since 2014, has come under increasing pressure from investors to make money. Many of the company’s peers have turned profitable after the oil-price crash two years ago, fueling questions as to why Hess has not followed suit. Shares dropped more than 2 percent in Wednesday morning trading. “We continue to make significant progress in executing our strategy and position our company to deliver long-term value and superior financial returns to our shareholders,” John Hess, the company’s chief executive and largest shareholder, told investors on a Wednesday conference call. Hess last month bemoaned the rising pressure from Wall Street to turn a profit, saying more attention on shareholder returns could drive down needed investment. For the second quarter, the net loss attributable to the company narrowed to $130 million, or 48 cents per share, from $449 million or $1.46 per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, Hess lost 23 cents per share. Analysts on average were expecting a loss of 29 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. The company’s average realized price of crude oil increased 36 percent to $62.65 per barrel, while production fell 16 percent to 247,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d), excluding its operations in Libya. U.S. crude prices topped $75 a barrel at the end of June, rising more than 18 percent in the second quarter. Hess said it earned $31 million from its exploration and production business in the quarter, compared with a loss of $354 million a year ago. The gains were also helped by higher production in North Dakota’s Bakken shale formation, where Hess is the third-largest operator. Hess plans to add a sixth Bakken drilling rig in the fourth quarter. Hess has been investing heavily in an oil development project off the coast of Guyana along with oil major Exxon Mobil Corp. The companies said earlier this week they expect one of the oil blocks in the project to contain about 25 percent more recoverable resources than initially estimated. For the full year, Hess reaffirmed its output forecast of 245,000 boe/d to 255,000 boe/d."

14.699750568214068," Focus on returns now will hurt long-term U.S. shale oil investment: Hess VIENNA (Reuters) - Investor pressure on oil producers to focus more attention on shareholder returns and less on output will drive down vital industry investment in the long term, a leading U.S. shale executive said on Thursday. Shareholders have been pushing for more dividends and buybacks from U.S. shale companies, whose heavy investment in production has helped the United States overtake Saudi Arabia to become the world’s second biggest oil producer after Russia. ""Investor sentiment in the last year has really, markedly changed. I'd say it's gone from, 'drill, baby, drill,' to 'show me the money,'"" said Hess Corp HES.N Chief Executive John Hess, speaking at the OPEC International Seminar in Vienna. His company, which has not made a profit since 2014, has been targeted by activist investors twice in five years. “While that financial discipline is healthy, I think it does act like a break on long-term investment. And that’s a factor that you have to add as you look forward,” said Hess, whose company operates in the Bakken shale of North Dakota and is spending heavily on an offshore oil project in Guyana. Hedge fund Elliott Management Corp launched a campaign in December against the chief executive, saying it was frustrated by the company’s “continuing underperformance” and floated the idea of removing him as CEO. Hess averted a show-down with Elliott before its shareholder meeting in the spring by agreeing to buy back $1.5 billion of its own shares to boost its stock value. The firm’s shares are now up 33 percent on their level before the move. Hess said the message from investors was: “We want you to have capital efficient growth. We want you to be free cash flow generative and we also want you to return capital to us.” U.S. shale comprises roughly 5 percent of global oil production, which Hess said he expected to rise to 10 percent by 2025 before leveling off. “There’s a worldwide obsession with shale. In the U.S., it’s irrational exuberance, and in other countries it’s irrational fear,” Hess said, adding that he did not expect the industry to gain traction in other countries. “We don’t see much prospect for shale going global,” he said. New York-based Hess does not operate in any OPEC member nation but was still sponsoring an oil seminar in Vienna, where he Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPEC states are meeting to discuss their pact on output levels. Hess, who speaks Arabic and Farsi, has been an intermediary between OPEC and U.S. producers. In his speech, he thanked OPEC Secretary-General Mohammad Barkindo for his “courageous outreach to the United States to build a shared understanding.”"

The company said it was working to turn operations around and boost returns. Hess has been cutting costs, reducing debt and ramping up its share buyback under pressure from activist hedge fund Elliott Management. “Our focus for 2018 is on execution and we believe we are off to a very strong start to the year,” Chief Executive Officer John Hess said in a statement. Shares of the New York-based company, which operates in North Dakota and the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, rose about 1.5 percent to $58.52 in afternoon trading. Net loss attributable to Hess narrowed to $106 million, or 38 cents per share, in the first quarter ended March 31, from $324 million, or $1.07 per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time charges, the loss was 27 cents per share, while analysts on average had expected a loss of 49 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Net production fell to 255,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) from 311,000 boepd a year earlier. However the company exceeded its forecast as production in North Dakota’s Bakken shale increased 12 percent. Production had been expected to be lower in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico due to a shutdown of the Enchilada platform following a fire. For the year, Hess expects production of 245,000 to 255,000 boepd. Total costs in the quarter fell 11.6 percent to $1.38 billion, from a year earlier. The company’s average realized price of crude oil jumped 22 percent to $59.32 per barrel. In Guyana, where Hess is a minority partner in an oil project with Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N, first oil production is still expected by 2020, with two subsequent projects coming online by 2022 and 2023 or 2024, executives said on a conference call with investors."
