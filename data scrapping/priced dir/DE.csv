8.878424952282748," Deere upgrades 2021 earnings outlook on improved farm equipment demand CHICAGO (Reuters) - Deere & Co on Friday upgraded its fiscal 2021 earnings forecast after profit more than doubled in the first quarter on improved demand for farm and construction machines, sending its shares higher. The Moline, Illinois-based company said higher farm commodity prices and rising exports, coupled with lower equipment inventories, have boosted the demand for farm machines. Its early order program for sprayers, planters and combines all experienced double-digit growth. Orders for large tractors now extend into the fourth quarter. To keep up, the world’s largest farm equipment producer has ramped up production and added shifts at some of its facilities in the United States and South America. “Ag fundamentals improved significantly throughout the first quarter,” Brent Norwood, investor communications manager, told analysts on an earnings call. Deere’s shares, which have outperformed the broader market, gained about 12% in morning trade and were last up 10.5% at $331.90. It expects industry sales of large agricultural equipment in the United States and Canada - the company’s biggest combined market - to grow by 15% to 20% this year. Improved demand has strengthened Deere’s pricing power, which together with cost control measures enabled it to deliver the highest operating margin, or the profit Deere makes on equipment sales, in company history. Its investment in technology offerings, aimed at reducing inputs costs and improving user productivity, has allowed it to charge higher prices for large farm machines. Deere said it is grappling with high levels of absenteeism due to the coronavirus pandemic and with supply constraints for some electronic components. Surging steel prices and elevated freight rates, meanwhile, are projected to cost it $500 million in fiscal 2021. The company now expects 2021 net income in the range of $4.6 billion to $5.0 billion, higher than the $3.6 billion to $4.0 billion forecast earlier. It reported a quarterly net income of $1.2 billion, or $3.87 per share - the highest profit in company history."

Deere was the main conduit between the Trump communications team and that of incoming President Joe Biden in the transition period leading up to Biden’s inauguration on Jan. 20. He was the last press spokesman in the West Wing when Trump departed that day.

She was deputy communications director in the Trump White House."
36.11111335450299," Improving farm economy drives up Deere earnings CHICAGO (Reuters) - Deere & Co on Wednesday reported a rise in quarterly earnings, defying Wall Street estimates, as higher crop prices, government subsidy payments and replacement demand lifted sales of farm machines. The maker of John Deere and world’s largest farm equipment producer forecast net income of $3.6 billion-$4.0 billion for fiscal 2021 as it expects to benefit from improving conditions in the farm economy and stabilization in the construction and forestry markets. The forecast is higher than a $3.3 billion estimate from analysts surveyed by Refinitiv and the $2.75 billion reported for 2020. “Higher crop prices and improved fundamentals are leading to renewed optimism in the agricultural sector and improving demand for farm equipment,” said CEO John May. Deere’s shares have outperformed the S&P 500 and gained 31% since its last earnings report in late August buoyed by a turnaround in the farm economy. They were up 2.4% at $267.90 in pre-market trade. Industry sales of agricultural equipment in the United States and Canada - Deere’s biggest combined market - are forecast to grow by 5% to 10% next year. Sales are also projected to increase in Europe and South America. Tightening grain supplies and strong demand from China have increased prices for soybeans and corn in the United States by a third since early August. Wheat prices are up by 22% on the back of an increase in baking. The rally marks a sharp reversal in fortunes for the U.S. agricultural economy after four years of global surplus grain stocks that have kept prices low. Meanwhile, federal payments to farmers are projected to hit a record $51.2 billion this year, contributing to the fastest growth in U.S. farm income in at least nine years. Improving financial conditions have lifted farmer sentiment to a record high. A growing need for farmers to replace aging tractors and combines is also helping demand. Deere’s fourth-quarter profit came in at $2.39 per share, up 5% year on year. Analysts had expected a fall of 36%, a survey of analysts by Refinitiv showed."
30.049430787833142," Deere's shares hit record high on earnings forecast upgrade CHICAGO (Reuters) - Deere & Co's DE.N shares hit an all-time high on Friday after the company lifted its full-year earnings forecast and posted a much smaller-than-expected decline in quarterly profit, on the back of replacement demand and higher adoption rates for precision agriculture technology. The world’s largest farm equipment maker said it now expects net income of about $2.25 billion for the full year, higher than the earlier estimate of $1.6 billion to $2 billion. Operating cash flow for the year is estimated to be $2.8 billion, up from the $1.9 billion to $2.3 billion projected in May. Deere’s shares, which have gained 43% since late May, shot up more than 6% to their highest-ever level of $202.81 after the earnings report. They were last up 5.6% at $201.84. While the coronavirus-induced uncertainty and the U.S.-China trade dispute have lowered commodity prices, U.S. President Donald Trump’s $19 billion farm relief program and the need to replace aging tractors and combines have underpinned farm equipment demand, particularly for small tractors. Deere said the lingering economic uncertainty is also driving farmers to invest in technology to reduce their costs and enhance productivity. Sales of the company’s planters and sprayers under the early order program were higher this year from a year ago. “We see significant levels of investment in solutions that have the highest demonstrable impact on improved customer economics,” Cory Reed, president of Deere’s production and precision ag division, told analysts on an earnings call. However, demand for large farm machines is expected to be down from last year. The Moline, Illinois-based company said it will restart share repurchases that were stopped in mid-March even as it plans to hold additional liquidity for an indefinite period to deal with business uncertainty. In response to the coronavirus fallout and a prolonged slump in the U.S. farm economy, agriculture equipment makers including Deere have cut production to prevent a supply glut and have kept a lid on costs. This has tightened supplies and driven inventories to below the 10-year average, allowing companies to protect their pricing power. That along with cost cuts helped Deere, in the latest quarter, cushion the impact of lower sales on its profit. Quarterly profit came in at $2.57 per share. Equipment sales fell 12.4% on a year-on-year basis, nearly half the pace expected by Wall Street, to $7.9 billion."
42.507635733470046," Deere signals recovery as U.S. farmers to benefit from relief program (Reuters) - Deere & Co DE.N on Friday topped quarterly sales and profit estimates and forecast a smaller-than-expected fall in farm equipment sales for the year, signaling a recovery in demand for its harvesters and tractors. Shares of the company, which withdrew its outlook in March due to an escalating COVID-19 pandemic, rose as much as 4% in early trading. Deere’s fresh forecast comes more than a month after President Donald Trump announced a $19 billion relief program to help U.S. farmers cope with the impact of the health crisis. The company’s sales were likely to benefit from the additional liquidity, analysts have said. “Deere noted signs of stabilization (in farm equipment sales) despite the week farm sentiment,” said Jefferies analyst Stephen Volkmann, adding that fiscal 2020 North American sales outlook of a decline of 10% was “surprisingly benign”. The company said it expects farm and turf equipment sales to fall between 10% and 15% this year. According to Jefferies, the midpoint is better than a 14% drop estimated by analysts. Deere typically sees a pick-up in sales of farm equipment after January as farmers start planting fields. That likely helped second-quarter demand for farm machinery hold up better than sales of construction equipment. It forecast 2020 profit in a range of $1.6 billion to $2 billion, down 39% to 51% from a year earlier. In the quarter ended May 3, farm and turf machinery sales fell 18% to $5.97 billion and construction and forestry equipment sales dropped 25% to $2.26 billion. Net income fell 41% to $666 million, or $2.11 per share in the quarter, but beat analysts’ average estimate of $1.62 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Equipment sales declined 20% to $8.22 billion, topping expectation of $7.69 billion. (bit.ly/2A3mEn2)"

34.628127054465594," How Deere, Caterpillar kept plants running during the coronavirus outbreak CHICAGO (Reuters) - While Detroit automakers' unionized auto factories have been idled by the coronavirus pandemic, farm and construction equipment makers Deere DE.N and Caterpillar CAT.N have won the support of the United Auto Workers and other unions to run their facilities during the pandemic. As U.S. states begin to lift lockdown orders and companies gear up to restart production, the policies put in place by the two heavy equipment makers offer a template for returning workers to idled factories in other sectors. Giving employees sick time without penalty, temperature screenings, staggered shifts and hiring a hygiene-auditing firm are some of the measures the two companies have taken to reassure employees to stay on production lines when many union and non-union workers balk at reporting for jobs that could expose them to the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19. Detroit’s auto companies had to negotiate long and hard with the United Auto Workers, which represents their hourly workers, over how and when to restart U.S. production. The UAW blocked the automakers’ plans to restart their factories on May 4. The union this week signaled its members are ready to go back to work at General Motors Co GM.N, Ford Motor Co F.N and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles NV's U.S. factories on May 18. By contrast, the UAW let Deere resume production at two of its facilities within days of employees testing positive for the virus. Union officials attribute that decision to a safety policy they negotiated with the company that mandates a strict implementation of guidelines prescribed by the nation’s health protection agency and the World Health Organization. But it was a provision for expanded benefits that sealed the deal, UAW officials say. “One of our priorities on the health and safety issue is to make sure that our members can self-report without any kind of penalty,” said Brian Rothenberg, the UAW’s public relations director. The union is negotiating with all its employers for similar benefits in order to reduce the risk of infection in the workplace. Deere declined to comment officially, citing the quiet period ahead of its earnings report later this month. Under its agreement with the UAW, Deere is providing paid sick leave to cover the recommended 14 days of self-quarantine, even to workers who think they have been exposed to the virus but are not certain and have not been tested. “The last thing we wanted was for individuals to feel compelled to come to work to get paid,” a Deere official said. The Moline, Illinois-based company altered shift schedules to ensure employees from one shift exit before the next shift reports to work. It hired an industrial-hygiene company to audit the sanitization work at some of its larger units. Additionally, the farm equipment maker enhanced pay provisions to cover the challenges workers face due to day care and school closings. It also waived copays, coinsurance and deductibles for its employees for coronavirus testing. At Caterpillar, the UAW and the United Steelworkers have negotiated a similar paid sick leave policy for their members. The heavy equipment maker is offering workers paid sick leave up to 2 weeks if they have been instructed to self-quarantine. The benefit also can be used for taking care of immediate family members. Production employees are allowed time off up to 10 weeks at 2/3 of their salary for child care. Caterpillar spokeswoman Kate Kenny said the benefits are available to all employees who are unable to work from home, not just union members. Workers are required to go for temperature checks before entering some facilities. To ensure social distancing, lunch hours have been extended at some locations and visitor access has been limited. It has not been smooth sailing for the two equipment manufacturers. Factories are hobbled by supply shortages, weakened demand and increased absenteeism among workers. Caterpillar’s retail sales dropped by 20% in North America in March. In response to the virus-induced business disruption, the company is temporarily shutting down facilities and imposed indefinite or temporary layoffs. Chief Financial Officer Andrew Bonfield said Caterpillar is managing production by segment and adjusting its workforce by facility. The situation at Deere is also uncertain. The company will temporarily suspend production at its Davenport and Dubuque facilities in Iowa on May 11 for two weeks due to supply chain disruptions. Depressed demand for construction and forestry equipment in the wake of the pandemic has led the company to lay off 159 employees indefinitely at the Dubuque facility. “You prepare for crises, but crises would be at one factory,” the Deere official said. “This is a crisis that has upended every unit.”"

The Moline, Illinois-based company is trying to cut costs to make itself more profitable. It is aiming to boost operating profit margin to 15% by 2022 from 12.5% projected for this year. The steps are part of a broader trend in the U.S. manufacturing sector which is battling a downturn. Deere’s shares were last trading down 2.8% at $155.47 in afternoon trade on Friday. Since late last year, the world’s largest farm equipment maker has, thus far, announced over 460 layoffs in the United States. Nearly three-fourths of those cuts have taken place at its facilities in Iowa, which could be a crucial state in this year’s presidential election. In the 2018 mid-term elections, two Republicans lost their re-election bids to the U.S. House of Representatives, giving Democrats a majority of the four congressional districts.

-10.670620696440679," Deere taps tractor-hailing tech in bid to break ground in Africa NANYUKI, Kenya/JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - It's ride-hailing, farm style. Deere & Co. DE.N is teaming up with the ""Uber of tractors"" in Africa and betting on a future where farmers summon machines with the touch of a button. The world’s leading farm equipment maker is outfitting its tractors with startup Hello Tractor’s technology, which allows farmers to hail the machines via an app, monitors the vehicles’ movements and transmits usage information such as fuel levels. The aim is to help the U.S. company boost sales of it famous green and yellow John Deere tractors, a tough task in a continent with the world’s highest poverty rate and the least mechanized agricultural sector. Deere is currently testing the technology - a small black box fitted beneath dashboards - on around 400 tractors in Ghana and Kenya. It told Reuters it plans to roll out the devices across Africa in the second half of this year, offering it to all contractors who buy its equipment on the continent. Jacques Taylor, who heads John Deere’s sub-Saharan Africa business, said that the continent badly needs more machinery to develop its farming industry but most farmers don’t have the scale to justify a large investment. “We would like to see that every farmer has access to mechanization,” he told Reuters. “The gap that we’ve identified is, how do we connect small farmers with tractor owners?” Deere declined to comment on the investment costs for the rollout. The risks are clear; there is no certainty of any measure of success in Africa, which accounts for a tiny fraction of its global sales at present. Held back by low incomes, tiny landholdings as well as a lack of bank financing, tractor numbers have long been stagnant on the continent, even as much of the developing world has experienced a boom in mechanization. Deere thinks it can help on the financing front: it told Reuters it could pull data from the Hello Tractor platform that showed in precise detail how farmers were using its equipment. That information, it said, could be used by the farmers - who typically lack credit histories - to help secure bank loans. This would mean they could buy more tractors. In central Kenya, a Deere tractor zig-zagged across a sun-drenched field, raking up dry grass and dropping bales of hay. The black box monitored its every move. The tractor belongs to Agrimech Africa, a Nairobi-based agricultural services firm that has taken up the offer to have the devices installed on its Deere machinery. “They do the technology. We do the management,” said Pascal Kaumbutho, who heads the company. Agrimech, which is paid by farmers to work their land, hopes the new tech will help optimize its Deere tractors and connect them to new customers, allowing it to expand. Kaumbutho, whose company manages a dozen tractors, envisions a future in which Agrimech runs a 1,000-strong fleet. “Right now, we’re reaching about 1,500 farmers,” he said. “Within the next two or three years, I’d like to reach 20,000.” Such opportunities exist in markets across Africa, said Hello Tractor founder Jehiel Oliver, but companies like Deere have lacked the tools to develop them. “Nigeria alone needs 750,000 (more) tractors to be on the global average,” he said. “Our technology is a market-maker for tractor manufacturers who want to sell into those markets.” Deere’s annual revenue of about $40 billion is dominated by the Americas and Europe. It doesn’t break out numbers for Africa, but combined revenue from Africa, Asia, Australia, New Zealand and the Middle East was $3.9 billion last year. Outside South Africa, the continent’s most developed economy, around 80% of African cropland is still cultivated by hand. Yields are half the global average. With its population set to double by 2050, increasing productivity is a necessity. One of the biggest barriers to mechanization is finance; though agriculture accounts for around a quarter of Africa’s economic output and some 70% of jobs, banks often view farmers as high-risk because of the lack of credit histories. “It’s one thing to go to a bank and say ‘You know. Hey, I work very hard.’ It’s another thing to be able to show it,” Kaumbutho said. Deere said the data from the Hello Tractor platform shows how often equipment is in use, how much land it’s working, and whether it’s tilling, planting or harvesting. That information can be used to create financial statements, it added. Tshepo Maeko, vice-president and head of agrisales at South African-based lender Absa, sees potential to unlock more lending in this kind of technology which gives banks a fuller picture. “We will be able to see how big the risk is or how big the opportunity is,” he said. Deere is working with Hello Tractor and the banks to format the data to create easily digestible automated reports. No loan decisions have yet been made based on the information. But Antois van der Westhuizen, John Deere Financial’s managing director for sub-Saharan Africa, said that should be possible by the time the scheme is rolled out across Africa. “The banking systems are trying to adapt,” he said. “It’s a journey for us to really get them to understand it.”"
-19.056618680038113," Deere's shares hit all-time high on unexpected rise in quarterly profit CHICAGO (Reuters) - Deere & Co's DE.N shares hit an all-time high on Friday after the company reported an unexpected increase in first-quarter profit, but the world's largest farm equipment maker warned the outbreak of coronavirus would hit sales and earnings in the second quarter. Shares surged 9.7% to their highest-ever level of $181.99 in morning trade after Deere said it sees signs of stabilization in the U.S. farm sector, which has been buffeted by a nearly two-year-long trade war with China. Shares were up 8% at $179.16 in mid-afternoon. A lower tax rate lifted the quarterly profit to $1.63 per share from $1.54 per share last year, topping Refinitiv’s average analyst estimate of $1.26 per share. The trade war hit American agricultural exports to China, a major buyer of soybeans, leaving farmers struggling to turn a profit and hurting purchases of new farm machinery. The Moline, Illinois-based company said an early order program for its combines ended this year with a low single-digit growth in the United States. It described the tractor order book for this year as “healthy.” “Farmer sentiment began to show early signs of stabilization during the quarter as uncertainty surrounding market access abated,” Brent Norwood, Deere’s investor communications manager, told analysts on an earnings call, referring to the Phase 1 U.S.-China trade agreement. The company, however, warned the outbreak of coronavirus will impact its next sales and profits report. The outbreak forced Deere to close all eight of its facilities in China and is also threatening to affect its factories in the United States by limiting supplies of several components that formerly came from China. Deere said limited production has restarted at some of its Chinese facilities. It projects spending $40 million in the second quarter on expedited freight and is working with suppliers and logistics providers to alleviate the supply issues. Illinois-based Morton Industries, which supplies to Deere, Caterpillar Inc CAT.N and Komatsu Ltd 6301.T, said customers are helping it to procure the impacted components domestically, but the prices of local vendors are higher. “There is a lot of effort going on right now to minimize the impact,” said Kevin Baughman, Morton’s vice president of operations. “We do not anticipate any supply disruptions with our efforts.” The epidemic has also cast doubts on whether China can boost U.S. farm purchases by the dollar amount agreed to in the interim deal. A little over a month since the U.S.-China trade deal, which mandates a sharp jump in U.S. agricultural exports this year, farm commodity prices remain depressed as Chinese purchases have been way below the pre-trade war levels. Norwood expects farmers to remain cautious until farm exports to China begin to flow. Sales at Deere’s farm and turf business, which accounts for nearly 60% of its revenue, declined in the latest quarter, but higher price realization along with lower production costs and warranty expenses resulted in higher operating profit. The company retained its 2020 profit forecast of $2.7 billion to $3.1 billion."

-8.008218704400626," Deere temporarily closes facilities in China due to coronavirus (Reuters) - Deere & Co said on Friday it has temporarily closed its facilities in China because of the coronavirus outbreak until the company determines it appropriate to reopen. The Moline, Illinois-based farm equipment maker has eight facilities in the world’s second-largest economy but none are located in China’s city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus outbreak. It was one of the most drastic steps taken by a U.S. company in response to the outbreak. American manufacturers have been mostly following the guidelines issued by Beijing - delaying reopening of their factories after the Lunar New Year. Deere shares closed down 1.6% at $158.58 on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange. The flu-like virus has resulted in 213 deaths in China and more than 130 cases have been reported in at least 25 other countries and regions. Wuhan, where it originated, and the surrounding region are in virtual quarantine. The World Health Organization has declared the outbreak a global emergency. The United States has decided to halt entry to the country of foreign nationals who had been to China within the 14-day incubation period, a day after issuing a “do not travel” advisory for the country.. Deere said it also has decided to restrict travel by its employees to and from China until a later time. Many of its employees in China will work remotely, it added.

The Moline, Illinois-based farm equipment maker has eight facilities in the world’s second-largest economy but none are located in China’s city of Wuhan, the epicenter of the virus outbreak. It was one of the most drastic steps taken by a U.S. company in response to the outbreak. American manufacturers have been mostly following the guidelines issued by Beijing - delaying reopening of their factories after the Lunar New Year. Deere shares closed down 1.6% at $158.58 on Friday on the New York Stock Exchange. The flu-like virus has resulted in 213 deaths in China and more than 130 cases have been reported in at least 25 other countries and regions. Wuhan, where it originated, and the surrounding region are in virtual quarantine. The World Health Organization has declared the outbreak a global emergency. The United States has decided to halt entry to the country of foreign nationals who had been to China within the 14-day incubation period, a day after issuing a “do not travel” advisory for the country.. Deere said it also has decided to restrict travel by its employees to and from China until a later time. Many of its employees in China will work remotely, it added.

-16.08853924204019," Deere bets on cost cuts, services push to boost profits CHICAGO (Reuters) - Deere & Co. DE.N on Wednesday said it will cut costs and ramp up investment in data-driven agriculture technology and its services business to make itself more profitable. In a pitch to investors, Chief Executive Officer John May said the measures are expected to boost operating profit margin to 15% by 2022 from 12.5% projected for this year. The steps, outlined by the company’s new leadership, are part of a broader trend in the U.S. manufacturing sector which is facing its deepest slump in more than a decade. In a bid to smooth earnings volatility, manufacturers such as Caterpillar CAT.N are slashing costs and focusing on more profitable parts and services businesses. May, who took over Deere’s reins in November, aims to shore up the company’s fortunes which have taken a hit from Sino-U.S. trade tensions as well as poor weather in the American farm belt that has slowed equipment purchases by farmers. The Moline, Illinois-based company reported lower profits in the latest quarter and has warned of lower earnings this year. U.S. President Donald Trump announced last month that China had agreed to double its pre-trade war purchases of U.S. agricultural products over the next two years as part of a Phase 1 trade deal. Still, Deere expects industry sales of farm equipment in the United States and Canada, its biggest market, to decline about 5% this year. In response to weak demand, the company has cut production and laid off workers. May said Deere is reviewing its overseas manufacturing footprint in markets that have peaked or where it has over-invested. He did not provide the names of those facilities. The company is also carrying out a voluntary separation program for its salaried employees, now projected to result in savings of $120 million, lower than $150 million estimated earlier. May expects the cuts to add 1 percentage point to Deere’s profits by 2022. The company is aiming to get a similar profit boost from investments in data-driven farming, known as precision agriculture, which enables farmers to plant according to the fertility of the soil, helping reduce input costs and enhance yields. Similarly, it is betting on its parts and maintenance services business to contribute 50 basis points in added profits over the next two years. The segment currently accounts for a fifth of the company’s sales."
-4.954100610377473," Deere warns of lower profits in 2020 on lingering trade tensions CHICAGO (Reuters) - Deere & Co. DE.N on Wednesday warned of lower earnings next year after reporting a fall in quarterly profits, hurt by trade tensions as well as poor weather in the U.S. farm belt that has slowed equipment purchases by farmers. In response to an “uncertain” business environment, the company announced a voluntary separation program for its salary employees, which is estimated to cost it about $140 million next year, but is projected to contribute to annual savings of $150 million. The world’s largest farm equipment maker said it was also reviewing its overseas footprint and would focus on growing its more profitable parts and services business. “2019 was a challenging year,” Chief Financial Officer Ryan Campbell told analysts on an earnings call. The world’s largest farm equipment maker expects net income of $2.7 billion to $3.1 billion next year, lower than $3.25 billion in 2019 and compared with Refinitiv’s average analyst estimate of $3.5 billion for 2020. The profit warning sent the company’s shares sinking 5% to $167.64 in morning trade. Deere gets a little over half of its revenue from the United States. Sales have taken a hit in the wake of the U.S.-China trade war that has dented U.S. agricultural exports, leaving farmers struggling to turn a profit. A sharp decline in U.S. corn exports and President Donald Trump’s ethanol policy have further pressured farm incomes. Poor weather, meanwhile, has delayed the harvest in the U.S. grain belt. Deere has cut production and laid off workers to keep a lid on costs in the face of weak demand. Those cuts helped it reduce the inventory of large tractors and combines in the United States to the lowest level since 2014. It expects global agriculture and turf equipment sales to decline 5% to 10% next year. Industry sales of farm equipment in the U.S. and Canada are forecast to decline about 5% on lower demand for large equipment. Sales of construction and forestry machines are projected to be down 10% to 15% worldwide in 2020. Adjusted profit in the latest quarter came in at $2.14 per share, down from $2.30 per share last year. Equipment sales were up in the quarter from a year ago. But profit from those sales declined due to higher operating expenses. Operating-lease losses resulted in lower quarterly profits at the financial services division, prompting a revamp of the leasing program."

-3.2555621933037022," Deere workers grapple with fallout from Trump's trade war EAST MOLINE, Illinois (Reuters) - Devin Spencer has been on edge ever since Deere & Co. laid off dozens of his colleagues at its Harvester Works plant in western Illinois due to dwindling demand for farm combines. He considers himself lucky to have escaped the indefinite layoffs, but has been relegated to a lower-level job with a pay cut. The 29-year-old welder blames America’s trade war with China, which has dented U.S. agricultural exports and, in turn, slowed sales of equipment, for his situation. Spencer, who is married with a young son, fears the worst if sales continue to sag and Deere cuts more workers. He is not alone. Hundreds of workers at Harvester Works are facing an uncertain future as a result of the 16-month-old tariff war. “Orders have sunk so low that I am lucky to have a job,” he said. “What happens if we don’t get orders? I am out of the door.” Deere, the world’s largest tractor maker, said last month it had indefinitely laid off 50 employees at Harvester Works, part of 163 layoffs across Iowa and Illinois, adding that each factory balanced the size of its workforce with demand for its products. Harvester Works’ union head David Thompson told Reuters that weeks later the company extended temporary layoffs for another 100 workers at Harvester Works until early January. The workers were due to return to work in November, he said. Another 300 employees have been downgraded to lower-level roles, Thompson added. Deere has not publicly disclosed the extension of the temporary layoffs or the relegation of workers. The company declined to comment for this story, citing a quiet period before quarterly earnings on Nov. 27. All the layoffs and job shuffles, which Thompson says have affected about 41% of the plant’s roughly 1,100 workforce, show how the trade war is hitting the operations of some manufacturers like Deere, regarded as a bellwether for U.S. agriculture and manufacturing. Last week, Deere told 12 workers at a facility that makes planting equipment just 15 minutes’ drive from Harvester Works that they would be laid off indefinitely from early January, the plant’s labor union head Heather Keag told Reuters. President Donald Trump’s trade war, coupled with poor weather in the U.S. farm belt, has dented the company’s earnings and forced it to cut production, as well as trim full-year profit and sales forecasts. Retail sales of Deere’s combines in North America have been falling since May, according to the company which reports figures on a three-month rolling basis. Its rivals are also battling lower sales. ‘LOT OF ANXIETY, FEAR’ Trump blames China for hollowing out U.S. manufacturing, and says his tariffs are needed to force a change in the way Beijing does business. He says his measures will ultimately benefit U.S. companies and workers by not only opening up the Chinese market, but also bringing manufacturing jobs back to the United States. Thompson, who did not vote for Trump, a Republican, agreed some measures were required, but said workers at his facility were bearing the brunt of the fallout. “There is a lot of anxiety, a lot of fear,” he said. The mood was different in early 2018. A nascent recovery in demand had led to healthy growth in orders for Deere’s planters and combines. Harvester Works began hiring new workers, said Thompson. But as the trade war began taking a toll on the farm economy, Spencer said farmers started cancelling their orders. “We could all see the writing on the wall,” he said. Deere is not alone. Rival Caterpillar, the world’s largest heavy equipment maker, has decided to let go of 120 workers in Texas, for example, while United States Steel Corp has had layoffs in Michigan. U.S. Federal Reserve reports show American factories are running way below their long-run average production levels and companies are delaying capital spending due to uncertainty over trade policy. U.S. manufacturing activity fell to a more than decade-low in September. Trump, however, said on Tuesday that industries had not been hurt by his administration’s trade actions. Harvester Works is in Illinois, a heavily Democratic state. But some industrial swing states like Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan that Trump narrowly won in 2016 are now shedding thousands of factory jobs. These states are up for grabs in 2020. Deere’s shares have gained about 2% since Trump announced a “phase one” trade agreement with Beijing on hopes that more agricultural sales to China would encourage farmers to resume purchases. The deal, however, is still being put to paper. Thompson worries the agreement will not be enough to help lift demand for his factory’s combines. Meanwhile Spencer, the welder, is now sweeping the floor of the plant. Apart from the psychological impact of doing a less skilled job, the change has reduced his earnings by more than a third. Spencer says he can no longer afford a vacation. When Trump first declared a war on the global trade order last year, he said: “Trade wars are good and easy to win.” However, employees at Harvester Works have yet to see any positives, according to Josh Saunders, who has been moved from a higher-paying welding role to an assembly job. The 37-year-old, who has a wife and two stepsons, is worried losing a job with one of the better employers in the area could force him to sell his house and move away. “I don’t know where this winning is coming from because we are having layoffs, and orders aren’t there,” he said."
7.328009692542025," Deere to lay off 163 U.S. workers as trade war dents equipment demand CHICAGO (Reuters) - Deere & Co DE.N on Tuesday announced indefinite layoffs for 163 U.S. manufacturing workers at plants in Illinois and Iowa that make agricultural, forestry and construction equipment, citing decreased customer demand. The layoffs come weeks after the company said it would reduce production by 20% at its facilities in Illinois and Iowa in the second of half of the year to keep inventory in line with retail demand. The world’s largest farm equipment maker is reeling from the fallout of the U.S.-China trade war that has slowed purchases from farmers. Meanwhile, lingering trade tensions have inhibited manufacturing activity and investment in nonresidential construction. Weaker demand in the latest quarter dented its earnings, forcing Deere to trim its full-year earnings forecast and initiate a review of costs. In August, the Moline, Illinois-based company said it was assessing its manufacturing footprint as part of the cost structure review. In an emailed response, Deere said 50 production employees at Harvester Works, which makes large agriculture equipment, in East Moline, Illinois, would be put on indefinite layoff. Separately, 113 workers would be laid off for an indefinite period at its construction and forestry plant in Davenport, Iowa. Deere’s shares closed on Tuesday down 1.9% at $165.50. The year-long tariff war between the United States and China has slashed the export earnings of American farmers. China imported $9.1 billion of U.S. farm produce in 2018, down from $19.5 billion in 2017, according to the American Farm Bureau. U.S. shipments to China of soybeans, the country’s most valuable farm export, sank to a 16-year low last year as Beijing shifted purchases mostly to Brazil, leaving American farmers with a surplus. Deere has said it expects industry sales of agricultural equipment to be about the same as last year in the United States and Canada, which account for 60% of its overall business. Sales in the region were earlier projected to be flat to up 5% earlier. (This story has been refiled to add dropped letter in paragraph two.)"

17.456626524223076," Deere to slash costs after trade war hits earnings CHICAGO (Reuters) - Deere & Co. DE.N on Friday announced a review of costs after a combination of the U.S.-China trade war and bad weather dented its quarterly profits, forcing the company to trim its full-year earnings forecast for a second time in the past three months. Investors cheered the decision to control costs, sending its shares up 3.1% at $148.07. The Moline, Illinois-based company said it is assessing its manufacturing footprint as part of the cost structure review. It will reduce production by 20% at its facilities in Illinois and Iowa in the second of half of the year. The cuts will impact the production of large tractors. The cost control measures are estimated to result in $25 million in savings this year and will be a centerpiece of its strategy over the next three years, the company told analysts on an earning call. The comments came after Deere’s production costs in the third-quarter shot up by 2 percentage points from a quarter ago. Yet despite its efforts, full-year production costs are projected to be above its previous estimates. Deere now expects full-year net income of $3.2 billion on annual sales growth of 4%, lower than the income of $3.3 billion on sales increases of about 5% projected earlier. “Concerns about export-market access, near-term demand for commodities such as soybeans, and overall crop conditions, have caused many farmers to postpone major equipment purchases,” said Chief Executive Officer Samuel Allen. Rival agricultural machine makers AGCO Corp AGCO.N and CNH Industrial CNHI.N have also slashed production to keep inventory in line with retail demand. The year-long tariff war between the United States and China has slashed the export earnings of American farmers.

15.718354296882033," Farm equipment maker Deere's dealers reel from trade war, bad weather CHICAGO (Reuters) - When China announced this week that it had stopped buying U.S. agricultural products and might impose additional tariffs on farm shipments from America, Dave Schmidt braced for another blow to his business. The Salem, Wisconsin-based dealer of Deere & Co's DE.N tractors, planters and combines is grappling with declining sales and higher levels of inventory as farmers have put off equipment purchases in the wake of rain-delayed planting in the Midwest and the yearlong Sino-U.S. trade standoff. Schmidt says sales at his dealership, in general, declined by as much as 15% in the first half of the year, led by a fall in the demand for large equipment. In a sign of things to come, early orders for planting equipment for next season’s soybean and corn crops are down up to 25%. He is not alone. Half a dozen dealers of Deere’s agriculture equipment across the Midwest shared similar accounts in interviews with Reuters. One of those dealers, in Geneseo, Illinois, said sales at his dealership were down 50% so far this year from the same period last year. This is a worrying sign for Deere, which gets nearly 60% of its sales from the United States and Canada. The Moline, Illinois-based company is expected to report lower sales at its agriculture & turf segment when it reports its third-quarter earnings on Aug. 16. The segment, which accounts for the bulk of the company’s sales, is expected to report quarterly sales of $6.24 billion, compared with $6.29 billion a year ago, according to Refinitiv IBES’ average analyst estimate. Overall, Deere is expected to report quarterly earnings of $2.88 per share, compared with $2.78 a share in the corresponding period last year. Revenue for the July quarter is forecast to come in at $9.40 billion, up from $9.29 billion last year. In May, Deere slashed its full-year profit and sales outlook, blaming the U.S. trade war with China for weak demand for its farm machines. The company’s shares, however, have gained a little over 14% since its last earnings report on hopes that a rally in corn prices would encourage farmers to buy new equipment. But dealers are not so sanguine. “We are not expecting demand for planting equipment to come back up this year,” Schmidt said. “We might see more repair and upgrading of the existing equipment.” Deere has downgraded the estimates for U.S. principal crop cash receipts this year, an important indicator for equipment demand, citing China’s retaliatory tariffs on American imports, which have slashed exports earnings of American farmers. China imported $9.1 billion of U.S. farm produce in 2018, down from $19.5 billion in 2017, according to the American Farm Bureau, the largest farm industry group in the country. U.S. shipments to China of soybeans, the country’s most valuable farm export, sank to a 16-year low last year as the Asian nation mostly shifted purchases to Brazil, leaving American farmers with surplus stocks. U.S. soy prices are down 18% since March 2018, when President Donald Trump launched a tariff war on China and other countries. Deere rival CNH Industrial CNHI.N last week said the shift has driven up its order book for tractors and combines in South America, particularly in Brazil. A record-wet spring has devastated a wide swath of the U.S. farm belt and inflicted more economic pain on soybean and corn producers, particularly those whose fields were too wet to ever plant, dampening hopes of an improvement in farm income and equipment sales. To compensate farmers for the market loss due to the trade war, the Trump administration has committed as much as $28 billion in federal aid. The latest tranche of the aid will likely begin to be paid out later this month. The bailout money, however, is not expected to lift equipment sales. “We are yet to feel most of the effects of too much water and the lower prices,” said Paul Gilsinger, a Deere dealer in Knox, Indiana. “In the second half of the year, demand could slow down further.” To prevent a supply glut, U.S. agricultural machine maker AGCO Corp AGCO.N and CNH have slashed production to keep inventory in line with retail demand. A similar concern prompted Deere to cut production by 20% at two of its large factories in North America. Yet, Gilsinger expects to be saddled with this year’s inventory next year. To move used machinery, he is offering waivers on interest on equipment financing. Schmidt’s dealership has been running a similar incentive program. Yet, the inventory turnover ratio for used tractors has doubled, he said. Adding to the worry, dealers are also encountering an increase in payment delays. “When you get into a slowdown, it takes a while for demand to build back up,” Schmidt said. “These things don’t change on a dime.”"
11.197024415781819," Deere blames escalating trade war for worsening outlook (Reuters) - Deere & Co on Friday missed quarterly profit estimates for the fifth-straight quarter and cut its full-year outlook, as an escalating U.S.-China trade war threatens to further hit farm incomes and demand for the company’s equipment. Shares of Deere, known for its trademark green tractors and harvesting combines, fell as much as 6% to $137.18, as slump in demand for big agricultural machines has forced the company to cut production by 20 percent at two of its large factories in North America. ""Ongoing concerns about export-market access, near-term demand for commodities such as soybeans, and a delayed planting season in much of North America are causing farmers to become much more cautious about making major purchases,"" Chief Executive Officer Samuel Allen said in a statement here. U.S. agricultural exports are likely to suffer, as the world’s two largest economies level escalating tariffs on each other’s imports in the midst of negotiations. Earlier this week, soybean futures fell to their lowest in more than 10 years, which is squeezing U.S. farmers whose incomes have already been under pressure from a global grain glut. (graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2BYCdun) China, the world’s top importer of soybean, bought about $12 billion worth of U.S. soy in 2017, but mostly shifted purchases to Brazil last year because of the trade fight, leaving U.S. farmers with surplus produce. Deere, which gets nearly 60% of its sales from the United States and Canada, said it now expects full year equipment sales to rise by 5 percent, compared with a 7 percent rise, it had previously expected, as large farm machinery sales lag. The company lowered its fiscal 2019 profit outlook to $3.3 billion, from its prior forecast of $3.6 billion, while raising its estimate for full-year costs by one percentage point to 76% of net sales, as the company speeds up research and development expenses. “The lower forecast is partly a result of actions we are taking to prudently manage field inventories, which will cause production levels to be below retail sales in the second half of the year,” said Allen. Some U.S. company executives have warned that costs related to the latest round of tariffs on goods from China will be passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices. Walmart Inc on Thursday said that prices for U.S. shoppers will rise due to higher tariffs on goods from China. Net income attributable to Deere fell 6.1% to $1.14 billion, or $3.52 per share, in the second quarter ended April 28, missing analysts’ estimates of $3.62 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Net sales rose 5.4 percent to $10.27 billion, and were above the Wall Street’s estimate of $10.19 billion."

-8.460384264934046," Deere's first-quarter earnings hurt by higher costs, trade war CHICAGO (Reuters) - Deere & Co’s first-quarter earnings on Friday missed Wall Street’s estimates, hurt by higher raw materials and logistics costs as well as by slowing trade between the United States and its partners, particularly China, sending its shares lower. The world’s largest tractor manufacturer retained its 2019 earnings guidance - full-year net income is expected to be $3.6 billion with a 7 percent annual growth in equipment sales. But whether the company would beat or miss the guidance depends on the outcome of Washington’s ongoing trade talks with China, which is one of the biggest export markets for U.S. agricultural products. Deere’s shares were down more than 2 percent at $159.01 in midday trade. The stock has gained over 9 percent this year, after falling about 6 percent in 2018, on hopes of a deal with Beijing. Hoping that the trade issue would be resolved soon, Deere built up roughly $1.3 billion in inventory in the first quarter from the previous quarter. Stephen Volkmann, a machinery analyst at Jefferies, says the inventory could weigh on the company’s profits if the trade standoff prolongs and may force it to resort to cost cuts. “If we settle the trade issue in a meaningful way, then this (earnings) forecast is conservative,” he said. “But if it continues to drag on, you are going to see some risk.” The trade war is further squeezing American farmers whose incomes have been under pressure amid a global grain glut. China bought about $12 billion worth of U.S. soy in 2017, but mostly shifted purchases to Brazil last year because of the trade fight. While China has recently returned to buy U.S. soy, the purchases have been too small to make up for the lost sales. With supplies swelling in the domestic market, prices plunged to near decade lows last autumn. Deere said the trade war has made farmers more cautious in making major purchases. However, it downplayed risks to the 2019 sales forecast, saying replacement demand for aging fleet was still “very healthy”. “We anticipate a resumed recovery in equipment volumes as new trade routes mature or U.S.-China trade contingencies abate,” Brent Norwood, investor communications manager, said on an earnings call. The company expects industry sales of farm and turf equipment in North America - its biggest market - to be flat to up 5 percent this year. But it trimmed the profit estimates for its agriculture and turf division, citing the slowdown in replacement demand for large farm equipment amid persistent trade uncertainties. Not only has U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff war clouded the outlook for farm equipment demand, but it has also inflated the domestic prices for steel and aluminum used by the company in making its products. Freight and raw materials costs are expected to remain elevated in the coming quarter. The tariffs on Chinese imports are projected to cost $100 million this year. Deere’s production costs in the first quarter shot up by 2 percentage points from last quarter. Higher manufacturing costs along with a rise in warranty-related expenses led to a 10 percent annual fall in operating profit in the first quarter at its agriculture and turf division. Sales at its construction and forestry division were up 31 percent year on year in the latest quarter. But the company downgraded the 2019 sales growth forecast for the unit to 13 percent from 15 percent estimated earlier. For the quarter ended Jan. 28, the company reported an adjusted profit of $1.54 per share, up 14 percent from a year earlier, but below analysts estimates of $1.76 per share, according to Refinitiv Eikon data."

The Moline, Illinois-based tractor maker expects net income of about $3.6 billion in 2019. That would translate into earnings of $11.10 per share, compared with the average analyst estimate of $11.47, according to Refinitiv data. Equipment sales for the world’s largest tractor manufacturer are estimated to grow 7 percent on the year in 2019 compared with a 29 percent jump in fiscal 2018, which ended Oct. 28. Still, the company’s shares opened higher as investors cheered the projected improvements in gross margins as well as the forecast for a flat to 5 percent increase in industry sales of agricultural equipment next year in North America, its biggest market. Industry sales for farm machines were estimated to have grown 10 percent this year. “We would argue the FY19 guidance big picture is better than headlines imply,” analysts at Baird Equity Research wrote in a note. Shares surged 3.8 percent to $143.80 in morning trading. Deere reported an adjusted profit in the fourth quarter through Oct. 28 of $2.30 per share, lower than Refinitiv’s estimates for $2.45, as equipment sales growth halved to 18 percent from the previous quarter. The company had forecast sales growth of 21 percent for the quarter. The slowdown was more pronounced outside the U.S. and Canada, where currency translation had a negative effect of 7 percent on sales during the quarter. Agriculture and turf equipment sales rose 3 percent in the quarter, compared with 18 percent in the third quarter. The U.S. trade showdown with China, one of the biggest export markets for U.S. agricultural products, is further squeezing American farmers whose incomes have been under a siege for the past four years amid a global grain glut. Last year, China imported 32 million tons of soybeans from the United States. But this year, the country has not purchased any of the U.S. crop after Beijing slapped a 25 percent tariff on U.S. imports in July. The move was in retaliation for U.S. duties on Chinese goods, imposed by U.S. President Donald Trump. There has been growing concern that depressed bean prices could induce a significant switch of acreage into other crops next year, causing a supply glut that could, in turn, hurt the prices of other farm commodities. On Wednesday, Deere moderated its previous expectations, projecting farm cash receipts to remain flat. It had earlier been hopeful that stronger demand for crops like corn, wheat and cotton would mitigate the impact of the trade battle and boost U.S. farm cash receipts in 2019. Its global sales for agriculture and turf equipment are projected to rise 3 percent in 2019, significantly slower than a 15 percent year-on-year jump this year."

For the quarter ended on Oct. 28, it reported an adjusted profit of $2.30 per share, up 46 percent but below analyst estimates of $2.45 per share, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.

8.079971173748632," Tractor maker Deere aims to ride green revolution in Africa JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - U.S. Deere & Co DE.N expects to see demand for its farm equipment in Africa grow 8 to 10 percent annually in the coming years, driven by expansion in key markets like Ethiopia and Zimbabwe, a local company executive said. Farming accounts for around 60 percent of total employment in Africa, according to the World Bank. In Ethiopia, Malawi, Mozambique, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia, food production is projected to add more jobs than the rest of the economy combined through 2025. A global policy shift away from food aid toward local production - championed at the start of the decade by the World Food Programme among others - has sparked a green revolution, increasing Africa’s potential as a market, said Jacques Taylor, managing director of John Deere Ltd Sub-Saharan Africa. “We started to see a commercial market developing for agricultural commodities ... That gave an incentive for farmers to produce more,” he told Reuters in an interview late on Thursday. Taylor said around 80 percent of its equipment shipments to Africa currently go to 10 markets, including South Africa, Zambia, Kenya and Ghana. “We see three or four countries with significant upside growth potential in the medium-term,” he said. “We see opportunity in countries like Angola, Zimbabwe, Ethiopia and obviously Nigeria.” Deere, best known for its John Deere branded tractors, currently ships its products to local dealers in Africa where its main competitors include CNH Industrial CNHI.MI and Landini. Deere’s dealer in Ethiopia is partnering with the government, in the midst of reforms, to set up an assembly plant to supply farm machinery to the market of around 100 million inhabitants. Zimbabwe is also undergoing of a major transition after long-time president Robert Mugabe, who was criticized for overseeing disastrous farm seizures, was ousted last year. “We have high hopes for Zimbabwe. It used to be the food basket for southern Africa. The potential is known,” Taylor said. “Zimbabwe could easily recover and get back to the levels of production they’ve seen in the past.” In neighboring South Africa, Deere’s most important market on the continent, President Cyril Ramaphosa’s ruling African National Congress has made land redistribution a key issue ahead of 2019 elections. Ramaphosa has promised the process will not threaten food security or growth, but the move has nonetheless unnerved some investors. “We do see it as a growth opportunity for us. There will be new entrants coming into agriculture,” Taylor said. “I think for the sake of the sector and the economy, it’s important for us to get clarity sooner than later.” Deere reported $2.8 billion operating profit from its equipment business last year, with 39 percent of that coming from its business outside of the United States and Canada. Sales grew 5 percent last year in those home markets. The company does not break down sales data further."
5.656811301550606," Deere is optimistic about U.S. farm economy, misses profit estimate CHICAGO (Reuters) - Deere & Co DE.N on Friday offered an optimistic forecast for the U.S. farm economy amid an escalating tariff war with China and other big trade partners as its quarterly profit missed estimates on higher raw material and freight costs. Shares of the world’s largest manufacturer of tractors and harvesting equipment erased early losses to turn higher, trading up 2.6 percent at $140.98. The trade showdown has depressed U.S. farm commodity prices as China and other trading partners target agricultural exports through retaliatory tariffs, clouding the outlook for equipment demand. Deere said the trade disputes have not hit demand for replacing aging equipment as farmers are still investing in technologies to make their operations more efficient. The company said it expects U.S. farm cash receipts in 2019 to be higher than this year as strengthening demand for crops like corn, wheat and cotton are seen offsetting soft demand for soybeans. “The situation right now is dynamic for the farmers and this can change,” Chief Financial Officer Rajesh Kalathur told analysts on an earnings call. “We would anticipate the net returns per acre for major crop farmers, large ag customers, to be higher in 2019 than 2018,” Deere said early orders for new farm machinery were up this year despite uncertainty over tariffs. “This essentially confirms that the replacement cycle is alive and well, supporting growth into 2019,” said Mircea Dobre, a senior analyst at Baird Equity Research. Deere’s comments are in sharp contrast to recent industry surveys that show the trade war and depressed commodity prices are hurting farmer sentiment. The Purdue University/CME Group Ag Economy Barometer recorded the largest one-month decline in producer sentiment since data was first collected in October 2015. Reports from Federal Reserve banks in the Midwest also point to growing stress in the farm economy. Yet, Deere, which finances farmer equipment purchases, further cut the estimate for credit loss provisions for this year and expects it to be well below the 10-year average. The Moline, Illinois-based company did not change its full-year earnings forecast, banking on replacement demand for large agricultural equipment. It is “confident” it would deliver adjusted net income of $3.1 billion in the fiscal 2018, it said in its Friday quarterly report, versus $2.2 billion in fiscal 2017. JP Morgan analysts said that would translate into $9.45 per share, lower than the estimate of $9.53. Adjusted profit in the latest quarter jumped 31 percent year on year to $2.59 per share, but was still below the average analyst estimate of $2.75. The cost of production as a percentage of net sales increased to 77 percent from 75.2 percent in the second quarter. Total equipment sales in the latest quarter jumped 36 percent from a year ago to $9.3 billion. Deere said it was addressing cost pressures by keeping a lid on expenses and price increases."

The Moline, Illinois-based company said on Friday net income attributable to the company rose to $910.3 million, or $2.78 per share, in the quarter ended July 29, from $641.8 million or $1.97 per share a year earlier. Total equipment sales rose 36 percent from a year ago to $9.3 billion. (Reporting by Rajesh Kumar Singh; editing by Andrew Roche)"
-5.785668558701228," Deere sues Precision Planting, AGCO claiming patent infringement (Reuters) - U.S. farm equipment maker Deere & Co DE.N on Friday sued Precision Planting LLC and AGCO Corp AGCO.N, accusing them of infringing on 12 of its patents. In filings to the U.S. district court in Delaware, Deere alleged that products made or sold by Precision Planting, including vSet seed meters along with SpeedTube products, infringed on its patents. The company said the patents protected its inventions that facilitate accurate seed placement, uniform seed spacing and even crop emergence. “Deere has suffered damages as a result of the direct and indirect infringing activities of Defendant and will continue to suffer such damages as long as those infringing activities continue,” the company said in the lawsuit. According to the lawsuit, the company is seeking unspecified damages. AGCO acquired Precision Planting in September 2017. Kelli Cook, a spokeswoman for both AGCO and Precision Planting declined to comment on the litigation. AGCO bought Precision Planting from Monsanto Co MON.N after the world's largest seed company terminated its agreement to sell the unit to Deere. Shares of Deere closed up 2.6 percent at $153.39 on Friday. AGCO’s stock ended the day up 1.2 percent at $64.34. The cases are: Deere & Company v. AGCO Corporation in the United States District Court for the district of Delaware, No. 1:18-cv-00827-UNA and Deere & Company v. Precision Planting LLC in the United States District Court for the district of Delaware, No. 1:18-cv-00828-UNA."

-8.99230347484264," Deere's full-year earnings revision, price hike boost shares CHICAGO (Reuters) - Shares of Deere & Co DE.N soared on Friday after the U.S. tractor maker revised up its full-year earnings estimate on stronger equipment demand and shared its plans to increase prices to offset increased costs. The company’s stock was up 6.4 percent at $156.24 in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Deere missed its second-quarter profit estimates amid higher freight and raw-material costs. The company’s sales costs shot up by 35 percent in the quarter from a year ago and it also expects input costs during fiscal 2018 to be higher than its previous estimate. “Material and freight costs have exceeded our forecast for the year, due largely to inflation in U.S. steel prices and a tight market for logistics,” said Chief Financial Officer Raj Kalathur. In response to those increases, the Moline, Illinois-based company said it was carrying out structural cost cuts and price increases. U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminum imports have inflated raw material costs for U.S. manufacturers. Caterpillar CAT.N last month warned that rising materials costs could squeeze profit margins in the coming quarter. Deere expects full-year adjusted earnings to be $3.1 billion, higher than $2.85 billion forecast earlier. Net sales and revenues are expected to jump about 26 percent from the previous year. It sees a 30 percent annual increase in full-year equipment sales. Adjusted profit in the quarter ended April 29 came in at $3.14 per share, lower than analysts’ average estimate of $3.31 per share. Freight costs were up as the company resorted to premium freight to address supply issues. Deere’s sales in the first quarter were hemmed in by delays in shipping products to dealers and supply constraints, but the company on Friday said the supply situation has improved. Deere has been battling tepid demand in North America, its biggest market, for the past four years as U.S. farm income has more than halved since 2013. Replacement demand for an aging fleet continues to drive farm equipment sales in the region, the company said. But it trimmed its farm equipment sales growth forecast to 14 percent for 2018 as it expects U.S. net farm cash income to dip further this year. That projection could change if a U.S. trade spat with China escalates, increasing trading costs for farmers who are already feeling squeezed by rising interest rates and high land prices. In retaliation for U.S. President Donald Trump’s proposed crackdown on Chinese imports, Beijing has proposed duties on U.S. farm imports such as soybeans, wheat and corn."
