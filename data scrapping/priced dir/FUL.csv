4.680112461565287," REFILE-UPDATE 3-UK pub operators cut jobs as swing to losses on lockdowns (fixes typo in story identifier) * M&B posts annual pretax loss of 32 mln stg * Fuller’s H1 loss 22.2 mln STG * M&B to cut 1,300 jobs, Fuller’s says total employees down 20% Nov 26 (Reuters) - British pub operators Mitchells & Butlers and Fuller, Smith & Turner said on Thursday they had cut around 1,650 jobs and suffered millions in financial losses as the hospitality industry reels from new lockdowns. The British Beer & Pub Association (BBPA) has warned of thousands, if not tens of thousands, of job losses if the government does not give pubs more freedom or grants to help them cover fixed costs in order to survive winter. M&B, which owns All Bar One, Harvester and Browns, said it had cut 1,300 jobs. Smaller rival Fuller’s said its total number of employees had been reduced by 20% following about 350 job cuts, the sale of its pizza chain The Stable and through natural attrition. The companies said they have enough resources to operate in the foreseeable future, but the downside scenarios cast doubts about their ability to continue as going concerns. “We are optimistic about the future in the medium term and beyond, but there is no doubt that this will be a tough winter,” Fuller’s CEO Simon Emeny said. Shares in M&B, which have lost around 50% of their value so far this year, fell 3.8% and Fuller’s was down 2.3% at 1156 GMT. Others in the industry have already reduced their workforce, with Marston’s planning to cut 2,150 jobs and cheap beer specialist J D Wetherspoon has cut staff at its head office and airport pubs. Pubs, restaurants and hotels have been among the hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic, with social distancing measures and curfews hitting capacity even when establishments have not been forced to shut altogether by lockdowns. The current lockdown in England started on Nov. 5 and is set to end on Dec. 2, but tough restrictions are expected to continue in many areas, and pubs and restaurants in the toughest third tier will only be allowed to reopen for takeaways. “The government must do more to help our pubs, the livelihoods they support,” BBPA’s Chief Executive Emma McClarkin said on Wednesday. “If not, this really could be the end of the pub in Britain as we know it.” M&B reported an adjusted pretax loss of 32 million pounds ($43 million) for the year ended Sept. 26 and Fuller’s a first-half loss of 22.2 million pounds. With 1.56 billion pounds in net debt as of Sept. 26, M&B in June had agreed to revised financing arrangements with its main creditors to bolster its available reserves after avoiding a debt default in April. M&B employs about 44,000 people, according to its website, in 1,700 pubs across Britain, while Fuller’s employed 4,957 people in over 200 pubs, its latest annual report showed.

The larger of the two, M&B, which owns All Bar One, Harvester and Browns, said it had cut 1,300 jobs. Fuller’s said its total number of employees had been reduced by 20% following about 350 job cuts, the sale of its pizza chain The Stable and through natural attrition.

Fuller’s, on the other hand, said it was confident it could secure revisions in its debt covenants beyond December and get credit lines beyond August. Shares in the London-listed companies were flat in morning trade, and M&B is on course to lose around 50% of its market value and Fuller’s 24% this year. M&B employs about 44,000 people in 1,700 pubs across the United Kingdom, while Fuller’s employed 4,957 according to its latest annual report."

-18.369966368576062," Texans end run of futility against Patriots EditorsNote: Clarifies Fuller’s TD taken away after review in graf 6; adds distance on Pats’ 4th-down play in graf 8; other minor edits Deshaun Watson passed for three touchdowns and added a receiving touchdown as the host Houston Texans defeated the New England Patriots 28-22 on Sunday. The Texans (8-4) maintained their one-game lead in the AFC South with their first victory over the Patriots (10-2) since Week 17 of the 2009 season. New England had been 10-1 all-time against Houston, including postseason play, with five wins over the previous four seasons. Watson, who finished 18 of 25 for 234 yards, became the first quarterback to throw two scoring passes against the Patriots this season. His 14-yard touchdown pass to Duke Johnson with 38 seconds left in the first quarter gave the Texans the lead for good and capped a brief three-play, 21-yard possession that followed a Bradley Roby interception of Patriots quarterback Tom Brady. Watson added a 13-yard scoring toss to tight end Darren Fells at the 6:21 mark of the second quarter that extended the lead to 14-3. His 35-yard strike to Kenny Stills with 5:41 left in the third pushed that advantage to 18 points and proved to be the decisive play because it just beat the play clock and came after a touchdown catch by Will Fuller on the preceding snap that was overturned and called incomplete following a review. The Texans’ relative success against the Patriots’ top-ranked defense proved surprising. That Brady and the New England offense continued to scuffle was no shock. While Houston surged to a 14-3 halftime lead, Brady completed just 7 of 19 attempts for 82 yards plus the interception in the first half. New England opened the third quarter with two fruitless possessions, with Roby registering a third-down sack of Brady to snuff the initial drive. Brady threw incomplete on fourth-and-1 at the Houston 42-yard line to complete the second possession of the second half. Even the Patriots’ first touchdown drive proved laborious, requiring 12 plays and taking 5:30 off the third-quarter clock. James White caught the first of his two touchdown passes, covering 12 yards, to pull the Patriots to within 21-9. But the Texans answered with haste, covering 75 yards over nine plays, capped when Watson caught a 6-yard pitch from DeAndre Hopkins following a double handoff with 9:53 left. Brady passed for two touchdowns inside the final four minutes, giving the Texans a scare before the subsequent onside kickoff attempt went out of bounds with 50 seconds remaining. Brady completed 42 of 47 passes for 326 yards. White paired 79 rushing yards with his 98 receiving yards and the two scores. --Field Level Media"
