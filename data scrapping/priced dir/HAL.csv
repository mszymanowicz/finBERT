0.8301044447685779," Halliburton profit up 60% as demand for oilfield equipment, services recover Halliburton Co (HAL.N) on Tuesday predicted a recovery in the global oil and gas industry from the second quarter after the oilfield services provider beat profit estimates on cost cuts and modest gains in activity following last year's slump. Crude oil prices are holding to gains from a rebound in late-2020 from a coronavirus-induced slump, with Brent crude hovering around $55 per barrel on Tuesday after averaging around $45 in the last three months of 2020. This has encouraged producers to complete more wells and add rigs. North America rig count was 410 at year-end, compared with 341 in the third quarter. ""We view 2021 as a bit of a transition year, and 2022 is when we see the global rebalancing of supply and demand,"" Chief Executive Officer Jeff Miller said on a post-earnings call, adding that he expected more consolidation in the industry. Miller said he is optimistic that the upturn in activity in North America would continue, while international markets would bottom out during the first quarter and improve as the year unfolds. However, he expects pressure to improve shareholder returns will hold output flat this year to 2020 exit levels. Halliburton, which kicked off fourth-quarter earnings for service providers, said revenue from North America jumped 25.8% from the third quarter, while international revenue rose 0.4%.  Completion and production business revenue was 15% higher in the fourth quarter, compared with the preceding three months. The company expects revenue from the business to rise 3% to 5% in the current quarter from the fourth, though operating margins are expected to fall 150 to 200 basis points. Drilling and evaluation revenue rose 1.9% sequentially and is expected to increase in the low single digit in the first quarter from the fourth. Total revenue of $3.24 billion beat analysts' estimates of $3.21 billion, while adjusted net income was 3 cents above estimates at 18 cents per share, according to Refinitiv IBES data. Halliburton, like its customers, has cut its capital spending and reduced its workforce, as energy demand and prices tumbled last year. The cost cuts helped the company generate free cash flow of $1.15 billion in 2020, above the $1 billion it had targeted. Still, profit slumped 43.9% and revenue tumbled 37.6% from the fourth quarter of 2019 as activity levels were still well below year-ago levels. Rivals Schlumberger (SLB.N) and Baker Hughes (BKR.N) are scheduled to report results later in the week.  "
13.76746491034292," Halliburton eliminates Venezuela staff after U.S. sanctions halt operations (Reuters) -Oilfield services provider Halliburton Co has eliminated all staff positions in Venezuela as a result of U.S. sanctions limiting its operations in the crisis-stricken OPEC nation, a spokeswoman for the company said on Thursday. Washington in April limited the activities Halliburton - as well as rivals Schlumberger NV, Baker Hughes Co and Weatherford International Plc - could perform in Venezuela. The United States in 2019 sanctioned state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela as part of its push to oust President Nicolas Maduro. Halliburton said at the time that it had halted its operations in Venezuela. “We have zero headcount in Venezuela,” the spokeswoman said in an emailed message on Thursday, adding that the company will maintain a presence in Venezuela through equipment and facilities. Halliburton, as well as most other major international oil services companies operating in Venezuela, had even before the sanctions significantly scaled back operations and written off hundreds of millions of dollars in assets and receivables due to operational issues at PDVSA, and late payments by the company."

Norway is western Europe’s top petroleum exporting nation. Some 262 Schlumberger employees had been due to strike if the talks failed, hitting the drilling of new oil and gas wells but not ongoing production."
26.583509123740306," Halliburton to set science-based emission reduction goals (Reuters) - Oilfield services provider Halliburton Co said on Thursday it would set greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in line with what the latest climate science outlines is necessary to meet the goals of the Paris Accord. The announcement comes as the global energy industry faces intense pressure from investors worried about the climate impact of fossil fuels. Halliburton joins over 1,000 global companies who have committed to set emissions reduction targets grounded in climate science through the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi). The SBTi is a collaboration of CDP, the United Nations Global Compact, World Resources Institute and the World Wide Fund for Nature. Halliburton will submit targets in 2021 with pending validation from the SBTi by 2022, the company said. Oilfield service companies have been trying to expand their footprint beyond providing equipment and services to drill and extract oil and gas, as they prepare for a transition to a low-carbon future. The United Nations-backed Paris Agreement seeks to limit global warming to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels by reducing carbon emissions to net zero."
69.22150610205429," Halliburton eyes slimmer shale industry but more profitable future (Reuters) - The U.S. shale industry will continue to shrink, but energy companies will emerge from the COVID-19 pandemic downturn stronger, Halliburton’s Chief Executive Jeff Miller told investors on Monday. Halliburton, the largest U.S. hydraulic fracturing service provider, beat Wall Street estimates, earning 11 cents a share versus expectations of 8 cents per share while posting its fourth straight quarterly loss on Monday. The next decade would be more profitable for the company, Miller said, noting rivals’ consolidation has been “great” for Halliburton. Some 30% of hydraulic fracturing equipment has been permanently retired, he estimated. Oil prices have recouped some of their losses from historic spring lows, but fresh travel lockdowns on a resurgence in COVID-19 infections are threatening that recovery. U.S. oil futures were trading around $40.75 early Monday. “The pace of activity declines in the international markets is slowing, while the North America industry structure continues to improve, and activity is stabilizing,” Miller said in a statement. “We see progressive improvement in 2021,” Miller said, pointing to an uptick in activity around unfinished wells. He estimated revenue in its completions and drilling business to increase by 10% this quarter, while margins will remain flat. Miller warned that a resurgence in COVID-19 cases remained a near-term risk, echoing larger rival Schlumberger NV, which on Friday posted a loss and warned that the recent economic recovery remained “fragile.” Halliburton has sharply cut costs, reducing its North American headcount and real estate footprint by 50% compared with the last year, Miller said. Its North American revenue fell 67% to $984 million in the third quarter. For the past two quarters, Miller said two-thirds of its revenue came from international markets as the Houston-based firm shifts its focus away from American operations. Revenue from its completion and production business was $1.57 billion for the quarter, compared with $3.51 billion a year ago, a decline of roughly 55%. Total revenue fell 46.4% to $2.98 billion. Shares were up about 3.4% in early trading at $12.67. Net loss attributable to the company was $17 million, or 2 cents per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared with a profit of $295 million, or 34 cents per share, a year earlier. The company took $133 million in severance and other charges."

The shambolic American pandemic response means opportunities big and small for businesses to help others – and themselves. Uber Technologies’ offer of free and quick contact tracing for coronavirus exposure is a case in point. The ride-hailing firm offers public-health departments worldwide a portal to track passengers and drivers suspected of being infected. That can help find others who may have been exposed, or block carriers from using Uber and spreading the disease. It’s useful, but not a huge tool in the fight. So far, there have been 560 virus-related requests globally, and 158 domestically. But finding even a few infected passengers can be useful, especially if they’re super-spreaders. In addition to health concerns, there’s another benefit for Dara Khosrowshahi’s firm. It has a history of conflict-laden relationships with local and national governments over the legalities and details of ride hailing. Currying a bit of favor with overwhelmed officials today might help Uber tomorrow. (By Robert Cyran) CORONAVIRUSES VS. OLYMPIC RINGS. Tokyo 2020 was originally due to start this week and is now set for a year’s time. The organizers have the worries of both governments and major sports organizations over Covid-19. Should delegations of athletes be slimmed down? Should spectators – whether Japanese or foreign – be allowed? If so, how can health safeguards be maintained? If not, what about ticket refunds? When do final decisions have to be made? The whole shebang is “endangered” according to the Wall Street Journal. Meanwhile, fewer than a quarter of Japanese people are in favor of holding the Olympics as now scheduled, according to a Kyodo News survey on Sunday. Nearly 60% of respondents expressed discontent with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s handling of the pandemic, too. And Tokyo is experiencing a Covid-19 flare-up. With an official but understated Olympics budget of $12.6 billion, it’s no surprise some might think the priority should be elsewhere. (By Richard Beales) VACCINE FRENZY. The UK is trying to create a cottage industry out of vaccines. The government has agreed to buy some 90 million doses of inoculations against Covid-19 from Germany’s BioNTech and France’s Valneva. Add those to the 100 million doses it has already ordered from AstraZeneca, and each UK citizen could get nearly three booster shots. Helpfully, the Valneva order will also create jobs at the group’s Scottish facility. Hedging your bets makes sense. It’s unclear which of the many vaccines in development will provide the best defence. AstraZeneca’s uses a chimpanzee disease to inject elements of Covid-19 into the body. BioNTech’s introduces coronavirus genes into human cells, while Valneva’s uses an inactivated virus. But there is not a single vaccine in development that can prevent the disease from being transmitted, which may cause even inoculated people to stay home, hurting the economy. Given the probable slow recovery, creating jobs has a certain logic. (By Aimee Donnellan) PANDEMIC TWIST. The pandemic may offer EssilorLuxottica an excuse to lower the cost of its toppy GrandVision purchase. The 53 billion-euro eyewear giant agreed last year to buy the Dutch retailer for about 7 billion euros. As with other pre-virus cash deals, that price now looks inflated. And the European Commission may make the takeover even less appealing by demanding big store sales. This may be why the Ray-Ban maker sued its target on Friday, accusing it of breaching a deal pact by not fully disclosing how it’s fighting the emergency. GrandVision rejects the claims. But it’s recovering more slowly than U.S. peers, says Bryan, Garnier & Co. And its net debt is fast approaching a cap of 993 million euros agreed when the deal was struck, potentially requiring top investor HAL to inject cash. With the risk of a second pandemic wave rising, the temptation for EssilorLuxottica to haggle for a lower price will grow. (By Lisa Jucca) DIGGING OUT OF A HOLE. It’s a bad time to be an oilfield-services company. The slump in both demand for fossil fuels as well as the lower price of black gold has brought the market for drill bits, cement and the like to a virtual halt. Shares in Halliburton are down more than 40% this year, worse than Big Oil firms Exxon Mobil and Chevron. But second-quarter results on Monday show Halliburton Chief Executive Jeff Miller playing a bad hand better than expected. The company still lost $1.7 billion in the three months to the end of June. But Miller has cut costs faster than analysts expected, allowing Halliburton to generate cash rather than burn it. That was past due; Halliburton was losing money even before the virus and Saudi Arabia-Russia oil-price war hit. Miller’s next trick is to prove he has done enough to return Halliburton to profit when demand improves. (By Antony Currie) PANDEMIC JITTERS. Julius Baer made hay in the first half of the year. The Swiss private banking group on Monday reported net profit of 491 million Swiss francs over that period, up 43% from a year earlier, thanks to frenetic trading by rich clients. Boss Philipp Rickenbacher said the second half could be challenging. If market activity were to fall back to pre-pandemic levels, the bank would struggle to make decent profit on managing client assets while interest rates remain ultra-low. The poor performance of asset management Kairos has also been dragging down Julius Baer’s advisory fees. The Covid-19 pandemic is not yet under control in several countries. And there are growing fears that a new wave of infection may be on its way. U.S. elections in November and global tensions surrounding China could also make asset prices more volatile. But as the first half showed, if markets jitters come back, Julius Baer may again benefit. (By Lisa Jucca) STRONG PROGNOSIS. Frans van Houten, chief executive of healthcare-kit specialist Koninklijke Philips, was finally able to deliver some good news about the patient’s progress on Monday. After a dire second quarter, in which hospitals paused non Covid-19 equipment orders and sent Philips’ sales down 6% year-on-year, he sees signs of life. Orders, which will be booked as revenue in future quarters, were 27% higher than a year earlier. And it’s not just ventilators: Hospitals want more specialist scanners too, van Houten said. That pushed Philips’ shares up by almost 4%, taking its market value to a record 41 billion euros. The rally may have further to go. It’s likely that governments and hospitals will raise spending after the pandemic, scarred by images of overcrowded intensive-care units. Selling equipment such as patient monitors may be the new shovels in a gold rush. (By Liam Proud) ANYWHERE BUT THERE. Japan is following through on its plan to encourage some companies to reshore production from China, starting with makers of facemasks. The total subsidy, at around $536 million, won’t go very far when spread around 57 companies. That suggests Tokyo is aware of the unattractive economics of companies moving back home where the minimum hourly wage is three times higher than in core Chinese manufacturing provinces. In addition, 30 companies are being paid to move out of China into Southeast Asia, including Vietnam, where labour costs are lower. A shift to these neighbouring countries sounds more realistic. Either way, it’s one thing to help companies invest in their home economy for critical medical equipment. It’s another to pay firms to evacuate from the People’s Republic for a third location. Relations between Tokyo and Beijing have been cooling, and this will add to the frost. (By Pete Sweeney)"
-4.73131011817175," Halliburton posts third-straight quarterly loss on shale slump (Reuters) - Oilfield services giant Halliburton Co HAL.N posted its third straight quarterly loss on Monday as it took a $2.1 billion impairment charge amid a slump in oil prices and collapse in drilling by North American customers. Demand for drilling services offered by Halliburton and rivals like Schlumberger SLB.N and Baker Hughes BKR.N sank after oil prices collapsed in March. U.S. crude futures were trading around $40 per barrel on Monday CLc1, at the bottom end of what most producers need to be profitable. Many smaller oilfield service firms, including fracker BJ Services and sand provider Hi-Crush, have filed for bankruptcy since the price rout began. As North American markets face pressure, Halliburton expects its international business to become a bigger contributor to its revenue, Chief Executive Jeff Miller told investors on Monday. Halliburton said it anticipates third quarter revenue to decline by low single digits, pressured by lower drilling activity. The company expects North American production to remain “structurally lower,” Miller said. The Houston, Texas-based company reported a net loss of $1.7 billion, or $1.91 per share, in the second quarter, compared with a profit of $75 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier. Shares rose 5.05% in early trading to $13.74 as market analysts praised its better-than-expected free cash flow and aggressive cost cutting. “We believe 2Q results reflect quicker and potentially stronger cost reductions,” analysts from Wells Fargo wrote in a note on Monday. The company reported free cash flow of $456 million, significantly topping expectations. Halliburton has slashed its quarterly dividend by 75%, cut its capital spending forecast to half to $800 million, and reduced its workforce and executive pay. The company is about 75% through a target of an annualized $1 billion in cost reductions. The company posted an adjusted profit of 5 cents per share, versus analysts’ expectations for a loss of 11 cents, according to Refinitiv IBES data."

34.47752658957835," Halliburton slashes dividend by 75% in latest move to save cash (Reuters) - Oilfield services provider Halliburton Co slashed its quarterly dividend by 75% on Wednesday, the latest move by the company to shore up cash to cope with a dramatic plunge in oil prices that began in March. U.S. oil prices experienced historic drops throughout March and April, brought on by the demand destruction caused by coronavirus-related lockdowns and a price war between producing nations. As oil and gas explorers slam the brakes on drilling to survive low prices, companies like Halliburton that provide drilling equipment and services have taken a major beating. Halliburton and larger rivals Schlumberger and Baker Hughes Co posted losses for the first quarter, owing to heavy writedowns on assets on the back of low oil prices. Each of the three service providers have also slashed their spending plans for the year, with Halliburton’s 50% reduction among the deepest in the industry. Halliburton has already lowered salaries for the company’s executives and cut roughly 1,000 jobs from its headquarters in Houston as part of a plan to reduce $1 billion of costs. The company set a dividend of $0.045 per share payable on June 24, down from $0.18 per share paid on March 25. Schlumberger, the world’s largest services provider, slashed its dividend by 75% last month. Members of Halliburton’s board also agreed to reduce their annual retainer by 20% on Wednesday. Halliburton’s shares rose about 3% in premarket trading as U.S. crude oil prices climbed to $32.18 a barrel. Still, both Halliburton’s shares and U.S. crude are at about half of what they began the year at."

49.30928626634758," Oilfield firm Halliburton cuts 22% of HQ staff as oil prices crash (Reuters) - Oilfield services firm Halliburton has laid off roughly 1,000 employees, or 22% of staff, at its corporate headquarters in Houston, a company spokeswoman said on Wednesday, as oil prices collapse. The cuts by one of the biggest names in oilfield services comes with oil prices having plunged to around $24 a barrel, far below production costs for many firms, prompting oil and gas explorers to slam the brakes on drilling. Companies that provide drilling equipment and services have been among the hardest hit. Halliburton, which had roughly 4,500 employees at its corporate headquarters in Houston, said the cuts were in addition to reductions across its global operations. “These actions are difficult but necessary as we adjust our business to customers’ decreased activity,” said spokeswoman Emily Mir. She attributed the layoffs to the “unforeseeable, dramatic business downturn caused by the coronavirus and unprecedented commodity price decline.” Halliburton, the largest provider of hydraulic fracturing services in North America, in March said it would furlough 3,500 employees in Houston, and has since made additional job cuts across its U.S. operations. Executives have also taken a salary cut, and the company cut its capital spending by roughly 50%."

Seeking to increase pressure on socialist President Nicolas Maduro, the U.S. Treasury late on Tuesday imposed restrictions on Chevron Corp's CVX.N joint ventures with Venezuelan state-run oil company PDVSA. The new restrictions effectively told Chevron, Halliburton, Schlumberger and others to wind down their activity in Venezuela by December. The new restrictions under a license that allowed Chevron and Halliburton to conduct business in the country include a ban on drilling, transporting oil or providing any equipments for use in Venezuela. Both Chevron and Halliburton had already halted many activities and Halliburton said the decision will not have a material impact on its financial condition. The company said in a regulatory filing here it is unlikely that its remaining assets in Venezuela could be removed from the country and it may have to dispose them."

76.41294563813749," Halliburton books $1.1 billion charge, slashes spending by 50% (Reuters) - U.S. oilfield services giant Halliburton HAL.N on Monday reported a $1 billion first-quarter loss on charges and outlined the largest budget cut yet among top energy companies as U.S. crude futures plunged to two-decade lows. U.S. oil prices have collapsed 80% since January and on Monday traded under $11 a barrel CLc1, a 34-year low, and below many shale drillers' cost of production. The coronavirus pandemic has crushed oil demand and prompted a sharp decline in the need for oilfield services. Halliburton said it would cut this year’s capital outlays by roughly 50% to $800 million, the steepest by a major energy company so far, and reduce other costs by about $1 billion. It has laid off hundreds and furloughed thousands of workers. The company has no plans to cut its shareholder dividend but added it was a ""lever"" that could be pulled and promised not to take on debt to protect the payment. Rival Schlumberger SLB.N last week cut its dividend by 75%, a move welcomed by investors. Halliburton, which generates most of its business in North America, booked $1.1 billion in pre-tax impairments and other charges, mostly relating to the value of a pressure pumping business that breaks shale rock to release trapped oil and gas. It posted a 25% drop in revenue from the region to $2.46 billion, while reporting a 5% increase in international revenue to $2.58 billion. “North America is experiencing the most dramatic and rampant activity decline in recent history,” Halliburton Chief Executive Jeff Miller said in a call with analysts. Customers’ capital spending is headed toward a 50% reduction for 2020, he said. Oilfield service rivals Schlumberger and Baker Hughes BKR.N also recorded large hits to earnings on writedowns and slashed their project spending budgets. Wall Street analysts were encouraged by Halliburton’s cost cutting measures, and its shares were up about 2% to $7.73 in morning trading. They are down 70% year-to-date. “We like the company’s proactive mindset and actions,” analysts for investment firm Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co wrote in a note. Halliburton warned it faced business disruptions from coronavirus-related border closures and travel restrictions that have prevented the company from accessing certain operations, as well as stay-at-home work arrangements. It reported a net loss of $1.02 billion, or $1.16 per share, in the first quarter, compared with a profit of $152 million, or 17 cents per share, a year earlier.

Staff cuts could begin this week at its Duncan, Oklahoma, facility, the filing said, and would be permanent. The facility is expected to remain open. In addition to the salary reductions for executives, Halliburton will suspend certain contributions made to employee retirement accounts, the company said.

187.19047193933227," Halliburton to furlough 3,500 workers as shale producers cut spending (Reuters) - Top U.S. oilfield services provider Halliburton said on Tuesday it will furlough about 3,500 employees in Houston for 60 days as shale producers slash spending amid falling oil prices. The affected staff will alternate working one-week on and one-week off during the two-month period. While they will keep their benefits during the furlough, workers will not be paid for the weeks not at work, a spokeswoman said. U.S. shale producers this month cut between 25% and 50% of planned spending as falling demand from coronavirus and a price war between Saudi Arabia and Russia threw the market into a tailspin. U.S. oil prices are down more than 50% this year to about $26 a barrel, from $61 a barrel in December. Smaller companies that provide equipment and drilling services to oil producers have been hard-hit by the downturn. Directional driller Payzone Directional Services this week disclosed it would halt operations. Liberty Oilfield Services, another Denver-based oilfield firm, last week said its executives would take a 20% pay cut. “We believe moving to this schedule will allow us to best manage costs and provide full benefits to our employees during this difficult market,” Halliburton spokeswoman Emily Mir said in a statement. Halliburton, the largest provider of hydraulic fracturing services in the United States, has about 30% of the pressure pumping market share, according to consultancy Primary Vision. The Houston, Texas-based company’s stock has fallen around 70% in the past four weeks, to $6.14. The firm already took a series of aggressive cost-cutting measures last year due to flat oil prices and slowing producer spending, including multiple rounds of job cuts and idling equipment."

-68.28437539698456," Halliburton takes $2.2 billion charge on shale slump (Reuters) - U.S. oilfield services firm Halliburton Co. on Tuesday disclosed a $2.2 billion charge to earnings as weakening North American shale activity continued to hit the industry. The charge for asset impairments was centered on hydraulic fracturing and legacy drilling equipment units, and employee severance costs, the company said. Halliburton dismissed 8% of its North American staff at mid-year, and later cut staff across several western U.S. states. U.S. producers are pulling back on drilling and completing wells, pressured by investor demands to focus on debt reduction and returns. Rival Schlumberger NV on Friday said it cut more than 1,400 workers, and would idle 50% of its hydraulic fracturing equipment due to weak demand. Fracking applies high pressure to release trapped oil and gas in shale wells. Schlumberger last year recorded a $12-billion charge to earnings and U.S. oil major Chevron Corp took an at least $10 billion charge on projects that were no longer economic to tap. “The U.S. shale industry is facing its biggest test since the 2015 downturn, with both capital discipline and slowing leading edge efficiency gains weighing down activity and production,” Halliburton Chief Executive Jeff Miller said on call with analysts. Halliburton will reduce capital spending by 20% this year, to $1.2 billion, executives said on the call, as North American customers further slash spending. It will recognize $50 million of the charges in the current quarter. The U.S. rig count has fallen by roughly 24% to 796 in the past year, according to rival Baker Hughes. Halliburton exited 2019 with 22% less working frack equipment than it began the year. Profit margins in units that drill, evaluate and put oil and gas wells into production will fall this quarter, it forecast. Excluding the charge, Halliburton topped analysts’ estimates for quarterly profit, boosted by higher drilling activity outside North America, a recent bright spot for oilfield service providers. The company swung to a $1.7 billion loss in the fourth quarter on the charge. On an adjusted basis, the company earned 32 cents per share, compared with analysts’ average estimate of 29 cents, according to Refinitiv. Shares were up 1.6% in early trading at $24.48. Halliburton said revenue from North America fell over 30% to $2.33 billion, while international markets rose over 10% to $2.86 billion in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31. Halliburton’s total revenue fell 12.6% to $5.19 billion, but beat estimate of $5.10 billion."

-71.69064432339952," Big three oilfield services firms start year with asset sales -sources NEW YORK/DENVER, Jan 16 (Reuters) - Schlumberger, Halliburton Co and Baker Hughes Co have kicked off the new year by putting units up for sale, as the three largest names in oilfield services seek to reshape their businesses and adjust to falling demand. Oilfield service providers are facing reduced spending by oil and gas producers as investors push for higher shareholder returns rather than more drilling activity. Competition also is forcing service companies to exit less profitable businesses. The trio, which hold about 26% of the global oilfield services market, according to consultancy Spears & Associates, recently disclosed plans to review operations in light of declining demand for their services. The asset sales, which could raise $800 million combined for the trio, come amid cost cutting. Halliburton last year cut more than 8% of its North American staff and Schlumberger booked a $12.7 billion writedown in October. “We believe this is best so we can focus on products and services core to the lifecycle of the reservoir,” Halliburton said in a statement, confirming the marketing of its pipeline and process services business. It hopes to close a sale by mid-year. Schlumberger and Baker Hughes declined to comment. The two separately hired advisers to sell units that boost production from wells using so-called rod lift gear, according to people familiar with the matter. Baker Hughes also has retained an investment bank to sell its wellhead services operations, two of the people said. All four operations are likely to be valued in the region of $200 million each, two of the sources said. Rod lift is an attractive divestment target because profits are slim and energy producers are switching to more advanced electric pumps which sit inside a well. Schlumberger’s recently appointed chief executive, Olivier Le Peuch, spoke in October of moving the company toward more asset-light software and services-driven businesses, which could retain profitability even when drilling activity is subdued. While the four planned divestments are small pieces of these large companies - Halliburton has the smallest market capitalization at $20.9 billion - analysts and investment bankers believe larger asset sales are likely in 2020. In a Jan. 15 note, Scotiabank analysts said it expects further guidance from Schlumberger on the future of its OneStim pressure pumping and completions business in the firm’s fourth-quarter earnings announcement, scheduled for Friday.

-40.850587728034," Halliburton lays off 70 employees at Bakersfield plant in California (Reuters) - Halliburton Co HAL.N is laying off employees at its Bakersfield plant in California in its latest round of job cuts this year, as the U.S. oilfield services firm struggles with falling profits amid slowing oil and gas activity. The layoffs are expected to impact about 70 employees at the plant, the company said in a filing with California authorities. Halliburton said the move was in addition to job cuts at other plants. The company reported a drop in third-quarter profit earlier in October and vowed more cost cuts to help realize $300 million in annualized cost savings. It recently closed a plant in El Reno, Oklahoma that impacted about 800 employees. Earlier in October, the company cut 650 jobs across Colorado, Wyoming, New Mexico and North Dakota. Halliburton - the largest provider of hydraulic fracturing services in the United States - and other oilfield services firms have been struggling as producers cut spending due to weak oil prices. In 2019, more than 50 frac spreads - or a set number of equipment that a service company uses for hydraulic fracturing - have left the Permian Basin, the largest U.S. oil producing region that spans Texas and New Mexico, according to consultancy firm Primary Vision’s estimates. Halliburton shares were up 3.6% at $22.19 on Friday."
22.27228658944282," Halliburton vows more cost cuts as shale demand dwindles, shares rise (Reuters) - Halliburton Co on Monday promised more cost cuts after reporting a bigger-than-expected drop in quarterly revenue as the oilfield services looks to counter weak demand from North American shale producers, sending its shares up about 7%. The biggest hydraulic fracking services provider, which earlier this month cut 650 jobs in North America, said it would take steps over the next few quarters that will lead to $300 million in annualized cost savings. Oilfield service providers are struggling with reduced spending by oil and gas producers as investors push for higher buybacks and dividends rather than growth in a weak oil price environment. Larger rival Schlumberger NV said on Friday it had recorded a $1.58 billion goodwill impairment charge related to its pressure pumping business in North America. “HAL is taking costs out more aggressively than the Street forecast, which it expects to lead to strong Q4 operating margin improvement in the Drilling & Evaluation segments despite falling revenue,” said Anish Kapadia, founder of London-based oil and gas consultancy firm AKap Energy. Halliburton warned of further activity declines in North America, with fourth-quarter revenue for its hydraulic fracturing business declining by low double digits and margins by 125 basis points to 175 basis points. “Feedback from our customers lead us to believe that the rig count and completions activity may be lower than the fourth quarter of last year,” Chief Executive Officer Jeff Miller told analysts during a post-earnings call. Halliburton said its revenue from North America, which accounts for more than half of the company’s total, fell 21% in the third quarter. Revenue from completion and production fell 16% in the three months ended Sept. 30. The company also idled more equipment in the third quarter than the first six months of the year, Miller said. Evercore ISI analyst James West said Halliburton was “showing leadership by walking away from unprofitable or low return work.” Net profit attributable to Halliburton fell to $295 million, or 34 cents per share, in the three months ended Sept. 30, from $435 million, or 50 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts had on average estimated 34 cents per share, according to Refinitiv IBES data. Revenue fell to $5.55 billion, below analysts’ average estimate of $5.80 billion.

33.55919014495937," Halliburton cutting 650 jobs in U.S. as oilfield business slows (Reuters) - U.S. oilfield services firm Halliburton on Wednesday said it was cutting 650 jobs across Colorado, Wyoming, New Mexico and North Dakota amid slowing oil and gas activity. Halliburton and its rivals that provide drilling equipment and services have suffered this year due to reduced spending by oil and gas producers amid weak prices. Spending by U.S. independent producers is projected to fall 11% this year, according to analysts at Cowen and Co. “Making this decision was not easy, nor taken lightly, but unfortunately it was necessary as we work to align our operations to reduced customer activity,” said spokeswoman Emily Mir by email. Most of the affected employees were given the option to relocate to jobs in other locales where more business is anticipated, she said. The cuts are in addition to an 8% North American workforce reduction that Halliburton announced earlier this year. The Houston-based company was the third largest oilfield services firm by revenue last quarter, behind Schlumberger and GE’s Baker Hughes, and the largest provider of hydraulic fracking fleets. The number of active U.S. hydraulic fracturing fleets, which release oil trapped in shale rock, has tumbled to 365, the lowest since spring 2017, energy consultancy Primary Vision said in a note on Wednesday. It estimates as many as 60 more fleets could be idled before the end of the year. Of the latest cuts, 178 were in Mesa County in western Colorado, according to a filing with the state’s Department of Labor and Employment. Halliburton will report its third-quarter earnings on Oct. 21. The company is anticipated to report earnings of 35 cents per share, down from 50 cents per share the same quarter last year, according to data from Refinitiv IBES.

15.445141335222907," Halliburton CEO sees consolidation in oilfield services as shale matures (Reuters) - Slowing growth in the maturing U.S. shale industry and spending cuts by oil and gas customers will lead to a consolidation of oilfield-service suppliers, Halliburton Chief Executive Officer Jeff Miller told investors on Wednesday. The largest U.S. supplier of fracking services to oil and gas producers expects its third-quarter results will be at the low end of its earlier forecasts as activity slows. The company also plans to reduce its 2020 capital spending, Miller said at the Barclays CEO Energy-Power Conference in New York. North American spending growth on oil and gas production will slow to a 2% this year, according to a Barclays survey released this week, down from a January estimate of a 9% gain. Analysts for the bank expect spending in the second half of the year to be 15% below the first half. Independent pressure pumper Liberty Oilfield Services also pointed to slowing hydraulic fracturing activity during a presentation at the Barclay’s conference. “I think the fall off may be quicker and harder and earlier than a number of people expected,” Michael Stock, Liberty’s finance chief, told attendees. Pressure pumping forces water, sand and chemicals underground to release oil and gas trapped in shale rocks, and to apply cement to complete a well. Halliburton’s Miller said some exploration and production companies have continued to attempt to push down service pricing, particularly where productivity gains have slowed or efficiencies are harder to achieve. Oilfield service companies’ margins on fracking have been squeezed due to an oversupply of equipment and as customers have tightened spending to focus on shareholder returns. U.S. energy firms have cut the number of oil drilling rigs for the nine straight months to its lowest since January 2018, according to oilfield service company Baker Hughes. Miller said he anticipates more consolidation among U.S. pressure-pumping providers, but he does not expect Halliburton to be active in those mergers and acquisitions. “Building is cheaper for us,” he said. Although North American oilfield activity has slowed, the company expects continued growth in other regions. “International spending has returned and in my opinion will continue to grow,” Miller said. Halliburton shares were up 7 cents, or 0.4%, at $18.83 in morning trading. They are off about 29% in the year to date."

-15.366627245207154," Halliburton profit exceeds analysts estimates as costs cut; shares rise (Reuters) - Halliburton Co HAL.N on Monday reported a second-quarter profit that beat analysts' estimates as its largest oil-well services unit exceeded expectations, sending shares to their biggest one-day gain in nearly three years. The Houston-based oilfield company is the largest provider of hydraulic fracturing services in North America, a segment of the business that has been hard-hit by overcapacity, making it difficult to raise prices. Halliburton Chief Executive Officer Jeff Miller said that market remains oversupplied and the company idled equipment during the quarter and will continue to do so. It has also taken steps to cut costs by reorganizing its North American business. Halliburton shares, which have declined nearly 18.2% this year, closed up 9.15%, or $1.99 a share, to $23.74, marking the largest percentage gain since November 2016. Revenues for the Completion and Production unit, which provides hydraulic fracturing services and tools to complete oil and gas wells, rose 4% from the prior quarter to $3.8 billion. Margins were boosted by cost-cutting and maximizing equipment usage, Miller said on a conference call. The company cut the number of North American employees by 8% in the second quarter, spokeswoman Emily Mir said on Monday. Byron Pope, an oilfield analyst for Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co, said, “The magnitude of the improvement in the Completions and Production margin performance” was encouraging, adding that it was good to hear the company publicly acknowledge that it has idled equipment. Despite the improvements, CEO Miller warned investors that third-quarter activity would decline as producer customers continue to focus on reducing spending. “We expect that activity in North America will be slightly down in the third quarter. We anticipate the slowdown to be more pronounced in the gassier basins due to persisting lower gas prices,” he said. Halliburton posted a strong increase in revenue from international markets, jumping more than 12% to $2.60 billion, in contrast to the 13.2% decline in North America to $3.33 billion. “Momentum is building internationally and activity improvement should continue into 2020,” Miller said in a statement. Rival Schlumberger NV SLB.N on Friday reported a profit increase on demand from markets outside North America. Net profit attributable to Halliburton fell 85% to $75 million, or 9 cents per share, in the quarter, hurt by impairments and other charges.

-22.99936906136308," Halliburton sees signs of price recovery, shares dip (Reuters) - Halliburton Co sought to convince investors on Monday that weak pricing which has undermined oilfield services providers over four years was on the verge of turning a corner. Better-than-expected revenue in North America, along with the company’s claim that prices were bottoming out, initially drove shares in the oilfield services giant almost 5 percent higher after it published first quarter results. But analysts and investors were unconvinced by a post-earnings conference call with management, which gave little hard evidence and left doubts over future pricing at a time when oil producers have been cutting investments. Shares ended the day down four cents apiece at $31.09. “I don’t think there was anything in there to get people off the sidelines,” said Jennifer Rowland, an analyst at brokerage Edward Jones, arguing the company’s comments fell short of what was needed to shift sentiment around the industry. “We are still kind of in the hope phase that the second half is going to look better,” she said. Halliburton and larger rival Schlumberger NV have been struggling with a tightening of spending by U.S. oil producers in response to shareholder pressure for greater returns following a period of heavy investment in shale. The Houston-based company, known globally for its investment in post-war Iraq, posted an 11 percent rise in international revenue on the back of gains in Mexico, Argentina and the Middle East, areas where Schlumberger also reported gains last week. However, in contrast to its larger rival, Halliburton said activity in its largest market, North America, was modestly higher. It added that it expects demand for its services to progress modestly for the next couple of quarters. “We believe the worst in the pricing deterioration is now behind us,” Halliburton Chief Executive Officer Jeff Miller said. Schlumberger last week posted a 3 percent fall in revenue from North America, blaming softer pricing and lower activity for its hydraulic fracking and drilling businesses. Halliburton’s revenue from the region fell 7 percent to $3.3 billion in the three months ended March 31, but came in above the $3.13 billion that five analysts had estimated on average, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. As expected, Miller also forecast further falls - a 6 percent to 10 percent decline in spending by oil producers in North America in 2019 - lower than the 10 percent fall forecast by Schlumberger. The company said it expects second quarter margins to rise 50 to 150 basis points from the first in both its drilling and evaluation units, as well as in its completion and production business. Revenue at the drilling and evaluation business is expected to rise in the low single digits percentage sequentially, while it is expected to grow mid-single digits in completion and production. The company also reiterated its expectation of high single-digit percentage growth for 2019 in international markets. On an adjusted basis, it earned 23 cents per share, edging past an average estimate of 22 cents. Revenue of $5.74 billion also beat a consensus of $5.53 billion."

Further reductions could be made if market conditions erode, executives said on the company’s fourth quarter earnings call. Last week, rival Schlumberger SLB.N also said it would spend less in 2019, a move that helped bump its shares more than 6 percent. Shares of Halliburton were down 6.4 percent at $30.15 on Tuesday. Investors were surprised by the extent to which the North American market was continuing to face downward pressure in the first quarter, Edward Muztafago, director of equity research for Societe Generale, said of the share decline. Although Halliburton beat profit expectations, Wall Street analysts questioned Chief Executive Officer Jeff Miller during the call on the lack of investor returns from the oilfield service sector, which has struggled to recover from the 2014 downturn in oil prices. Halliburton’s share price in December fell to its lowest level since 2010. Houston-based Halliburton said revenue from North America fell about 2 percent to $3.3 billion from a year earlier and dropped 11 percent from the third quarter. International revenue rose to $2.6 billion from $2.5 billion a year earlier. It rose 7 percent from the third quarter. “In North America, the demand for completions services decreased during the fourth quarter, leading to lower pricing for hydraulic fracturing services,” Miller said in a statement. The number of active hydraulic fracturing fleets in the Permian basin fell to 140 in January, versus 192 in June of 2018, a 27 percent decline, according to data from consultancy Primary Vision. Halliburton’s international business “continues to show signs of a steady recovery,” Miller added. The company saw an increase in demand for services in Argentina, which help offset some lower activity in North America. Halliburton said net income attributable to the company was $664 million, or 76 cents per share, for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a loss of $824 million or 94 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, the company earned 41 cents per share, beating analysts’ estimates of 37 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Fourth-quarter revenue was largely flat at $5.94 billion."

3.6314232511915496," Supreme Court rejects U.S. troops' appeal over 'burn pits' illnesses WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday turned away a bid by U.S. troops sickened by smoke from open-air pits used to burn waste in Iraq and Afghanistan to revive a lawsuit against defense contractors KBR Inc and Halliburton Co. The justices left in place a 2018 lower court ruling in favor of the companies. The former service members said in the lawsuit that they developed various cancers, neurological damage and other illnesses, often fatal, because of KBR’s negligent operation of the burn pits. The case centered on the liability of KBR and Halliburton over waste disposal services they provided the U.S. military in Afghanistan starting in 2001 and Iraq starting in 2003. KBR was part of Halliburton until it was spun off in 2007. The Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the various consolidated lawsuits brought by service members and their relatives amounted to a “political question” that Congress and the president should resolve, not the courts. The plaintiffs, whose cases were consolidated in Maryland in 2009, said they were harmed because the companies did not follow correct safety procedures. They accused KBR of placing the burn pits too close to occupied areas and operating them without regard to wind conditions. The contractor used the pits to dispose of plastics, tires, batteries, medical waste and other material that released airborne toxins when burned. Both companies said they should not be held liable. The Supreme Court in 2015 declined to hear the cases at an earlier stage in the litigation after the companies lost a prior bid to dismiss the lawsuits. Dick Cheney, who served as chairman and CEO of Halliburton from 1995 to 2000, was U.S. vice president at the time the American military operations involved in the case began in Afghanistan and Iraq."
-9.43588295634098," Probe of U.S. Interior Secretary Zinke's conduct referred to DOJ: reports WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Interior Department’s acting inspector general has referred a probe into Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke’s conduct to the Justice Department for further investigation, media reports said on Tuesday, citing unnamed sources. Referring a probe to the Justice Department means it will explore whether evidence warrants a criminal investigation. Mary Kendall, the acting inspector general of the Interior Department, is conducting at least three probes into Zinke’s conduct, but it was not clear which one had been sent to the Justice Department, the Washington Post said. Among other investigations, Kendall is probing Zinke’s involvement in a Montana land deal and a decision not to grant two tribes approval to run a casino in Connecticut. A senior White House official said the White House understands the DOJ investigation is looking into whether the secretary “used his office to help himself,” according to the Washington Post. The Interior Department’s inspector general said in a letter to lawmakers in July that the office was investigating a Montana real estate deal involving a foundation set up by Zinke and a development group backed by the chairman of oil service company Halliburton Co. The letter said the inspector general had launched the probe on July 16 to look into a development deal in Zinke’s hometown of Whitefish, Montana, between a group funded by David Lesar, Halliburton’s chairman, and the foundation. The deal was first reported by Politico. A Lesar spokeswoman said in July that his personal investment had nothing to do with Halliburton and that the company was confident the Interior Department would not be influenced by it. The Interior Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Zinke told CNN that he had not been contacted by the Justice Department, that he follows the law, and that the DOJ investigation was “politically driven” and “has no merit.” Nancy DiPaolo, spokeswoman for the Interior Department’s inspector general office, said she could not comment on any ongoing investigation. The White House and the Department of Justice did not immediately respond to requests for comment."
-13.626380023976212," Halliburton forecasts lower fourth-quarter profit, shares fall (Reuters) - Shares of oilfield services provider Halliburton Co fell on Monday after the company warned that fourth-quarter earnings would come in below analysts forecasts amid ongoing weakness in the North American hydraulic fracturing market. Halliburton, the largest provider of hydraulic fracturing services, has seen demand for its services soften as U.S. producers cut down on spending and transportation bottlenecks in the Permian Basin of west Texas and New Mexico pushed the price of regional crude lower. The company had previously warned that slowing growth in the largest U.S. shale basin would impact its results. Halliburton said it expects the U.S. onshore sector to find a “bottom” in the fourth quarter, as producers reset 2019 budgets and next year begin working through a record backlog of drilled-but-uncompleted wells. The company on Monday said it anticipates a fourth quarter profit of 37 to 40 cents per share. Analysts were forecasting a profit of 49 cents per share, according to Refinitiv. While demand for its North American completions services has weakened, the firm’s international business is showing signs of recovery, the company said on Monday, as global oil prices have climbed to around $80 a barrel. Halliburton’s international revenue rose 5 percent from the second quarter to $2.4 billion, while in North America, revenues decreased 2 percent sequentially to $3.74 billion. North American revenues are up 18.2 percent year-over-year. “Our international business continues to show signs of a steady recovery,” Chief Executive Officer Jeff Miller said in a statement. Shares of Halliburton were down about 2 percent at $36.93 in early trade. In September, they fell to a roughly two and a half year low after the company warned of slowing U.S. activity. “We’re not exactly doing cartwheels given near-term pricing and utilization headwinds in the domestic hydraulic fracturing market,” analysts for Tudor Pickering Holt & Co wrote in a note on Monday. Rival Schlumberger NV also managed a slight third quarter profit beat last week but cautioned that North American growth would slow due to the bottlenecks and hurt results next quarter. Net profit attributable to Halliburton rose to $435 million, or 50 cents per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, from $365 million, or 42 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned 50 cents per share, beating average analysts’ estimate of 49 cents per share, according to Refinitiv estimates. Total revenue rose to $6.17 billion from $5.44 billion a year ago."

-19.30637974930682," Halliburton shares fall 5 percent after CEO warns about third-quarter profit (Reuters) - Shares of oilfield services provider Halliburton Co fell 5 percent on Wednesday after its chief executive officer warned that third-quarter earnings could be hurt by 8 cents to 10 cents per share from moderating activity in the Permian Basin and a slower-than-expected ramp-up of new Middle East contracts. Analysts estimated earnings of 59 cents per share in the quarter, up from 42 cents in the same quarter last year, according to consensus estimates from Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Pipeline bottlenecks, a tight labor market and inflation are slowing activity in the largest U.S. shale basin, CEO Jeff Miller said at a Barclays conference in New York. The slowdown threatens to undermine a recovery in the oilfield services sector, which was hit hard by the 2014 downturn in oil prices. “We have more white space on our calendar than expected. This creates pricing pressure,” Miller said. Halliburton also is experiencing a slower-than-anticipated ramp-up of new contracts in the Middle East, which will affect its third-quarter earnings, Miller said. Shares fell $2.02 at $37.46 in morning trading. Halliburton is a leading supplier of hydraulic fracturing services in the United States, which had put it in a good position to capitalize on a recovery in benchmark oil prices to near $70 a barrel. However, more oil and gas producers are opting to hold off completing wells as local prices in the Permian fall to near four-year lows, diminishing demand for those services. On Tuesday, oilfield rival Schlumberger NV warned that the hydraulic fracturing market had softened more than expected."

-16.62734032683003," Hundreds line up for gushing West Texas oil jobs ODESSA, TEXAS (Reuters) - Job fairs are stocked with people hungry for better opportunities, but inside the MCM Grande Hotel in Odessa, Texas, oil services giant Halliburton is the one doing the wooing. “We need to hire you is our message,” said Chris Redman, a field services manager with Summit ESP, which Halliburton acquired last year. More than 500 men and women flocked to the hotel in Odessa, Texas, on a Thursday last month to be courted by Halliburton, which needs people to handle everything from oilfield technicians to truck drivers, as oil production booms and qualified workers become more scarce. The U.S. unemployment rate is 3.9 percent, just off an 18-year low, but job growth has slowed more recently - notably because companies are having trouble finding people. That is particularly true in the oilfields of West Texas, where workers from local towns like Midland and Odessa have flocked to the oil industry for higher pay. According to a June Dallas Federal Reserve Bank survey of 60 oil executives operating in West Texas, more than half cited difficulty finding workers as a potential drag on growth. Halliburton, the second largest provider of oilfield services after Schlumberger, is adding more than 175 jobs a month, hiring executives say. Redman said people with commercial drivers’ licenses are in particular demand, but numerous attendees at the jobs fair do not have that license. Janice Venables, 57, drove out to West Texas from Mississippi a month ago, after being laid off from Mississippi Power last year. She is applying for two jobs with Halliburton, but says she has applied for as many as 26 other oilfield jobs. “I don’t care where I go. I just need a job, and I’ve heard the wages are good,” said Venables. She lives in a recreational vehicle with her dog and cat, does not have a commercial driver’s license, but has started the process to enroll in a commercial driving class this fall. Kenneth McGowan, 21, drove 12 hours from Mississippi with five friends, some just above the legal age to work for Halliburton, to apply for oilfield jobs. Like many in attendance, they heard about the fair through a Facebook advertisement. McGowan, who works as a stocker at a Walmart, hopes to find a job providing cementing services for wells. “I’m not worried about the long hours,” said McGowan, who is supporting a 3-year-old daughter. He does not have a commercial driver’s license, but said he is prepared to get one if needed. McGowan and his friends are not the only job hopefuls to make the trek from Mississippi, where employment in June was 4.7 percent, one of the highest levels in the United States, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The rush to apply for commercial drivers’ licenses comes as demand for truck drivers, in the oil industry and elsewhere, has driven up wages for anyone with the license. Frank Hardin of Tennessee, who previously drove trucks delivering sand with Amerifield Inc, said he recently landed a job as a driver CIG Logistics. Instead of getting paid per load delivered, he now has a salaried position with CIG, which starts workers at as much as $85,000 with full benefits. Hardin welcomes the change. “That’s what everyone wants. It’s a cakewalk for guys who’ve been on the road for years,” he said."
-13.911022560165678," Halliburton shares plunge on Permian growth worries (Reuters) - Shares of oilfield services provider Halliburton fell by more than 8 percent on Monday after the company warned of moderate growth in the oil and gas-rich Permian Basin and lower third-quarter earnings. Halliburton said some of its customers are reducing activity and lowering their rig count because increased production in the Permian Basin in west Texas and New Mexico has left companies that transport oil to Gulf Coast markets unable to keep up, as existing pipeline, rail and trucking capacity falls short of needs. The bottlenecks have driven down the price of regional crude compared with U.S. benchmark oil and are threatening to dampen demand for oilfield services and equipment. Halliburton was the largest hydraulic fracturing provider in North America as of March, according to consultancy Rystad Energy. Halliburton, meanwhile, lost about 7 percent of its market share in the Permian Basin between the first and second quarters of this year, according to preliminary data from Primary Vision Inc, which tracks hydraulic fracturing fleets. Halliburton Chief Executive Jeff Miller said third-quarter results would likely mirror those of the second quarter and strove to play down the problems with transportation of crude out of the Permian. The company expects a 4 cents per share hit to earnings in the current quarter on the slowdown and on higher maintenance costs, he said, a number already baked into the company’s forecast. “I’m not naive to the math around the off-take issue,” he told an earnings conference call, adding later: “Even in the Permian, as we’ve described that, that’s a moderation in growth as opposed to a pullback.” Analysts said investors read those comments as an admission that the Permian was on the cusp of a slowdown and Miller also said that the bottlenecks would subside only in 2019. That took the shine off a 24 percent year-on-year rise in Halliburton’s revenue for the second quarter that was slightly ahead of analysts expectations. Shares were down 8.1 percent at $41.53 afternoon trade. While Halliburton continues to benefit from soaring U.S. oil production - a record 11 million barrels per day this month - the Permian issues and a stalling of both oil prices and the U.S. stock market have helped knock more than 20 percent off Halliburton shares since May. The company’s operations are more heavily weighted toward North America than those of its peers, leaving the it more vulnerable to the pipeline bottlenecks than rival Schlumberger, which missed forecasts for quarterly revenue last Friday. Excluding one-time items, the company earned 58 cents per share, in line with Wall Street estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. “What the market is trying to discount is the change in earnings estimates and the outlook for North America, especially the North American land market ... as growth in the Permian moderates,” said Evercore ISI analyst James West. A doubling of crude oil prices since early 2016 has underwritten a surge in production that should make the United States the world’s biggest oil producer this year."

-16.125075555116776," U.S. Interior watchdog probes Zinke over real estate deal WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Interior Department’s watchdog said in a letter to lawmakers on Wednesday that it was investigating a Montana real estate deal involving a foundation set up by Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and a development group backed by the chairman of oil service company Halliburton. The letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters, said that the agency’s inspector general had launched the probe on July 16 to look into a development deal in Zinke’s hometown of Whitefish, Montana, between a group funded by David Lesar, Halliburton’s chairman, and the foundation. Neither the inspector general’s office nor the Interior Department, which comments on behalf of Zinke, replied to requests for comment. Halliburton spokeswoman Emily Mir said in an email that Lesar’s “personal investment in a small land development in Montana has nothing to do with Halliburton, and the company is confident that any actions of the Interior Department will not be influenced by (his) personal investment.” The deal, reported by Politico in June, included a hotel, retail shops and microbrewery. The brewery would be set aside for Zinke and his wife Lola to own and operate, Whitefish city planner said in the Politico story, though the developer said at the time that no final decision had been made. Politico reported that Zinke’s foundation, the Great Northern Veterans Peace Park Foundation, had pledged in writing to allow the Lesar-backed developer to build a parking lot for its Peace Park project. Zinke’s wife Lola is president of the foundation, a position she took over from her husband when he became secretary. The letter, first reported by Politico, was addressed to U.S. Representatives Raul Grijalva, Donald McEachin and Jared Huffman, all Democrats, who had asked the inspector general to investigate if Zinke had used taxpayer resources to advance land developments. The letter said the investigation had been opened because the lawmakers “expressed special concern about the reported funding by a top executive at Halliburton and assuring decisions that affect the nation’s welfare are not compromised by individual self-enrichment.” Zinke has pushed for opening federal lands for energy development as the Trump administration pursues a policy of energy dominance to maximize production of crude, natural gas and coal. The Interior Department’s inspector general has also been investigating Zinke over travel issues since late last year after reports that he had used a private plane owned by an oil executive while secretary."

-19.89140283591598," Halliburton revenue jumps on higher North American demand (Reuters) - Oilfield services provider Halliburton Co HAL.N reported a 34 percent jump in first-quarter revenue on Monday as North American companies boosted oil and gas production amid rising oil prices. The jump in revenue came despite a $312 million writedown on Halliburton’s remaining assets in Venezuela, and a hit to earnings related to the impact of cold weather earlier in the quarter. Halliburton expects normalized margins of around 20 percent in North America by the end of this year, supported by ongoing tightness in the hydraulic fracturing market, Chief Executive Jeff Miller said on Monday. “We believe the pressure pumping market is undersupplied and will remain tight,” Miller said, pointing to high fracking equipment utilization rates and service intensity that is degrading existing equipment. Some 3.3 million of additional hydraulic horsepower is expected to be added to the U.S. pressure pumping fleet this year, according to consultancy Rystad Energy. The additions have stoked concerns among investors that companies could overbuild equipment. Halliburton’s revenue from North America jumped nearly 58 percent to $3.52 billion in the three months ended March 31, while revenue from international operations rose 9 percent. Total revenue jumped to $5.74 billion from $4.28 billion. Its shares were trading at roughly $51.13 on Monday morning, off about 1.6 percent as part of a broader decline in energy stocks. U.S. crude futures CLc1 were trading around $67.40, down about 1.45 percent. Adjusting for items, Halliburton posted a profit of 41 cents per share in the latest reported quarter, in line with analysts’ estimates, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Halliburton in February warned it expected a 10 cents per share hit to first-quarter earnings due to delays in deliveries of sand used in fracking. Net income attributable to Halliburton shareholders was $46 million, or 5 cents per share, in the three months ended March 31. The company posted a loss of $32 million, or 4 cents per share to shareholders, in the same quarter a year earlier. The company said it continues to see tightness in the U.S. labor market, and in supply chain segments such as rail and trucking. Higher prices will be needed to absorb the impacts of wage inflation, Miller said during the company’s earnings call on Monday. Halliburton on Monday also said it would remain in Venezuela, which has been plagued with political and economic turmoil, but carefully manage its exposure in the OPEC-member country."
