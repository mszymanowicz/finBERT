Demand for large appliances known as white goods, including refrigerators, washing machines, tumble driers, picked up during the COVID-19 pandemic, as people diverted their discretionary spending from social activities like traveling into upgrading their homes to ease household chores. “As we enter into 2021, we continue to see signs of economic recovery - such as positive demand and encouraging structural housing trends,” Chief Executive Officer Marc Bitzer said. The owner of brands including KitchenAid and Maytag said it expects full-year 2021 adjusted profit to be between $19 per share and $20 per share, the midpoint of which is above analysts’ average estimate of $19.10, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The Benton Harbor, Michigan-based company expects free cash flow of $1 billion or more in 2021 and net sales to rise 6%.

6.883726767152599," 9th Circuit tosses $14.8 mln fee award in Whirlpool ‘coupon’ class action (Reuters) - A new decision from the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, vacating a $14.8 million fee award to class counsel in a case alleging that Whirlpool dishwashers were prone to overheat, seems likely to discourage plaintiffs' lawyers from agreeing to settlements in which a big chunk of the relief can be characterized as a coupon. Under the settlement agreement at the heart of the 9th Circuit case, class counsel’s fees were to be paid directly by Whirlpool rather than coming from the class recovery. But the two sides could not agree on an amount. The company and plaintiffs’ lawyers had widely divergent views on the value of the settlement, which included cash payments to dishwasher owners who had to repair or replace their appliances as well as rebates discounting the price of future dishwasher purchases. Plaintiffs’ lawyers from Chimicles Schwartz Kriner & Donaldson-Smith; Rifkind Weiner Livingston; Lieff Cabraser Heimann & Bernstein; Law Offices of Jeffrey M. Cohon and Weinstein Kitchenoff & Asher claimed the entire deal was worth as much as $116.7 million to the class. Whirlpool said that the actual class recovery would be more like $4.2 million, based on the 3.7% claims rate and deficient documentation by most of the owners seeking a cash payout. Want more On the Case? Listen to the On the Case podcast. Rather than award fees based on a percentage of the settlement, U.S. District Judge Fernando Olguin of Los Angeles based his fee award on class counsel’s lodestar billings of nearly $9 million, applying a 1.68 multiplier for the “impressive” results and novelty of the case. Whirlpool, represented by Mayer Brown, appealed the fee award. Objectors represented by the Bandas Law Firm, Lang Hanigan & Carvalho, the Law Office of Sam Miorelli and Scott & Cain also appealed, protesting approval of the settlement as well as the fee award. The 9th Circuit panel – Judges Richard Clifton, Kenneth Lee and U.S. District Judge Frederic Block of Brooklyn – ruled in an opinion written by Judge Lee that 9th Circuit precedent in 2013’s In re HP Inkjet Printer Litigation and 2018’s Easysaver Rewards Litigation precluded Judge Olguin from basing the fee award only on class counsel’s lodestar billings. Those decisions held that the Class Action Fairness Act does not allow trial judges to award lodestar fees for coupon settlements. (Plaintiffs’ lawyers argued that the rebates in the Whirlpool settlement were not coupons, but the 9th Circuit said they were because class members would have to lay out additional money to receive the credit, which applied only to the future purchase of a Whirlpool dishwasher within a limited timeframe.) When judges are setting fees for a “mixed” settlement that includes both cash and coupon components, the 9th Circuit said, the preferable method is to disaggregate the value of the cash and coupon components and add together separate calculations of appropriate fees for the two components. Fees for the non-coupon piece of the deal can be based on lodestar billings. The award for the coupon component should be a percentage of the value of the coupons to the class. Alternatively, the 9th Circuit said, a trial judge can base the entire fee award on lodestar billings, but only if he or she applies a multiplier to reflect redemption of the coupons. If class members don’t actually use the coupons, the appeals court said, then trial judges should discount the lodestar. That gets complicated in a settlement like the Whirlpool deal, when dishwasher owners have a relatively long timeframe to use their rebate. But the 9th Circuit said judges can award fees on a staggered basis. The appeals court made clear that the adjusted lodestar method should only be used when it’s too difficult to untangle the value of the two settlement components and that trial judges must provide an explanation when they adopt the disfavored approach. In this case, the 9th Circuit said, Judge Olguin should attempt on remand to figure out the redemption value of the coupons and the value of the cash relief. For the second component, the appeals court said, “the record provides ample evidence (including) evidence on the likely deficiency rate of the dishwashers, the value of coverage for future deficiencies and other relevant factors.” (The 9th Circuit also said that its review of the record suggested that plaintiffs had overestimated the value of the deal, failing to account for deficient cash claims and projecting that future overheating claims per year would outstrip the total number of claims over the last decade.) I’m not sure, though, how trial judges can realistically segregate lodestar bills for the non-coupon portion of the deal from billings on the coupon component. Discovery and briefing isn’t conducted on those two separate tracks, after all. In a case like this one, with high lodestar bills, relative to the class recovery, and an agreement that the defendant would pay class counsel’s fees, plaintiffs lawyers might have been better off if the deal had not included a coupon component. As things stand, they can’t claim their entire lodestar billings. Class counsel Steven Schwartz of Chimicles, who argued for plaintiffs’ lawyers at the 9th Circuit, did not respond to my email query. Whirlpool said in an email statement that it was pleased with the decision. “The original fee awarded in this case was grossly disproportionate to the amount plaintiffs’ lawyers recovered for their own clients, the class,” the statement said. “The 9th Circuit’s decision provides important guidance for determining a fee award that will be fair and reasonable to the class, plaintiffs’ lawyers, and Whirlpool.” Objectors’ counsel Rob Clore of the Bandas firm, who urged the 9th Circuit to overturn approval of the settlement, said the ruling helps only Whirlpool, not class members. “Parties shouldn’t be able to contract their way around the (CAFA) statute by segregating fees,” Clore said by email."
2.938225618098628," Whirlpool sees strong 2020 as profit beats on pandemic boost (Reuters) - Whirlpool Corp WHR.N on Wednesday forecast a smaller drop in sales for the year and reinstated earnings targets after posting better-than-expected quarterly profit, as robust demand for home appliances helped it navigate the coronavirus crisis. Shares of Whirlpool, the owner of brands such as KitchenAid and Maytag, jumped 4.5% after the bell as third-quarter sales rose 3.9%, with a strong performance in European markets offsetting weakness in North America, its biggest segment. Demand for appliances has bounced back as consumers stuck at home divert their discretionary income, otherwise earmarked for socially intensive activities like traveling, into the home. Whirlpool said it now forecasts earnings per share between $17.50 and $18 for fiscal 2020, compared with analysts’ estimate of $13.71, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Its Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) market saw sales growth of 15.4% while sales in Latin America rose 13.7%, but coronavirus-induced supply constraints drove North America sales 1.6% lower in the quarter. Still, Whirlpool said it now expects net sales to decline between 5% and 7% in 2020, compared with its previous forecast for a fall of 10% to 15%. Whirlpool, which increased its quarterly dividend by $0.05 to $1.25 per share on Monday, said it earned $6.91 per share excluding items, beating analysts’ estimate of $4.20 per share. Net earnings available to the company rose to $397 million, or $6.27 per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 30 from $358 million, or $5.57 per share, a year earlier.

-25.694824806194976," Whirlpool forecasts 2020 largely above estimates as profit beats (Reuters) - Whirlpool Corp WHR.N beat analysts' estimates for quarterly earnings and forecast 2020 profit largely above expectations on Monday, as the appliances maker raised prices and reined in expenses to cushion the impact of higher production costs. The owner of brands such as KitchenAid and Maytag increased prices twice in 2019 as U.S. tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, both major components in the company’s products, pushed up the cost of production. Chief Executive Officer Marc Bitzer told CNBC that the company will maintain the high prices. “Yes, we’ve seen some relief on the raw materials. And yes, it’s coming down. But we’re far away from having kind of eaten into that $700 million high of cost increases,” he said, noting that the company is still facing the impact of rising cost over the past two years. Whirlpool said it expects full-year 2020 profit to be between $16.00 per share and $17.00 per share, the mid-point of which is above analysts’ average estimate of $16.34, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump last week announced adjustments to tariff-rate quotas (TRQ) on large residential washers, saying that domestic producers had begun to do better in the face of foreign competitors but more was left to be done. Net sales fell nearly 5% to $5.38 billion, missing analysts’ estimates of $5.52 billion as higher prices crimped demand for washing machines and dishwashers. Sales were flat in the company’s biggest market of North America, while they fell in the other three regions. Brand transition investments and soft demand environment resulted in another quarter with operating losses in China, the company said. Net earnings available to the company rose to $288 million, or $4.52 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $170 million, or $2.64 per share, a year earlier. Whirlpool said cost of products sold fell nearly 8% to $4.33 billion. Excluding items, the company earned $4.91 per share, beating estimate of $4.27. Whirlpool is expected to hold a post-earnings conference call with analysts on Tuesday before the bell. The company’s shares were flat in extended trading."

-33.01844090720838," UK regulator orders recall of fire-risk Whirlpool washing machines LONDON (Reuters) - Half a million washing machines manufactured by Whirlpool Corp WHR.N and sold in Britain are to be recalled following an order from the country's safety regulator which found they pose a fire risk. The latest recall follows one for faulty tumble dryers in July, which also posed a fire risk. Whirlpool will start a recall and replacement program for the washing machines next month, the Office for Product Safety and Standards (OPSS) said on Tuesday. The recall will be undertaken by Whirlpool UK Appliances Ltd, which identified a fault in some Hotpoint and Indesit models sold since 2014. According to OPSS’s advice, there is a risk that the door locks of affected machines could catch fire due to overheating during the washing process. It said affected consumers are advised to unplug their machines and register with Whirlpool for a no-cost replacement. “The Office for Product Safety and Standards will closely monitor Whirlpool to ensure the recall is carried out successfully,” said OPSS Chief Executive Graham Russell. “Our priority is to keep consumers safe and we urge affected customers to unplug their washing machines, contact Whirlpool and follow its advice.” Jeff Noel, vice president of Whirlpool, apologized for the recall. “We know this will cause some concern. We especially understand that the washing machine is so important to family life, and in Christmas holiday season it will be even more of an important matter and, for that, we apologize,” he told the BBC."
-0.4718275921517151," Whirlpool drops plan to shut plant in southern Italy ROME (Reuters) - U.S.-listed white goods maker Whirlpool Corp WHR.N has dropped plans to shut down a production site in the southern Italian city of Naples after two weeks of workers' protests, the company said on Wednesday. Whirlpool announced on Oct. 15 that it planned to shut down and sell the site, which it said was no longer profitable, prompting union protests and disappointing the Italian government after months of talks aimed at saving the plant. Workers had reacted fiercely to the decision and metalworkers union FIOM-CGIL had called for work stoppages and protests at the group’s other plants in Italy. On Wednesday, Whirlpool announced a change of course, saying it was “ready to withdraw the sale procedure ... not to proceed with the layoffs in Naples and to continue the production of washing machines.” In a video posted on Facebook, Industry Minister Stefano Patuanelli said the decision would open the way to finding a long term solution for the site. “It is a first step towards restarting the talks with the aim of definitively resolving the site’s problems,” he said. Whirlpool, which employs around 5,500 people in Italy had said the closure was necessary because the production of high-end washing machines in Naples was no longer profitable. The factory employs 400 workers in a region with some of the highest unemployment levels in the country. In June, the Italian government threatened to scrap all incentives it had granted to the company to keep investing in Italy, estimated at some 50 million euros since 2014."
-7.937524168608532," Whirlpool sales miss estimates as Latin America drags (Reuters) - Whirlpool Corp WHR.N on Tuesday reported quarterly sales below analysts' estimates, hurt by lower appliance sales in Latin America, sending its shares down 2% in trading after the bell. Net sales in the Latin American unit fell 28% to $632 million in the third quarter. Chief Executive Officer Marc Bitzer attributed the decline to the sale of the company’s Embraco compressor business and to a small extent to currency changes. Whirlpool has been looking to sell its loss-making businesses and in July completed the sale of Embraco to Japan's Nidec Corp 6594.T. The white goods maker’s quarterly net sales fell 4.4% to $5.09 billion, missing analysts’ estimate of $5.13 billion. The Michigan-based company has raised prices of its products twice this year to counter rising costs from higher U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum - the two main raw materials for the company. Bitzer told Reuters the company does not have any plan to raise prices further unless the price of raw materials change. Whirlpool, the owner of brands such as KitchenAid and Maytag, also affirmed its full-year adjusted earnings forecast of between $14.75 and $15.50 per share.

12.231872446858542," Whirlpool says costs, strong dollar to hit 2019 profit, shares fall (Reuters) - U.S. home appliances maker Whirlpool Corp said on Monday its 2019 adjusted profit and revenue are likely to rise less than analysts’ expectations due to a higher tax bill, costs and a strong dollar, sending its shares down 6.5 percent after the bell. Whirlpool has been grappling with high costs as a trade dispute between United States and China has made imported steel and aluminum more expensive, forcing it to raise prices for its washing machines and kitchen appliances. The company said it expects about $300 million more in expenses due to higher import duty on raw materials used in its appliances. A higher tax rate is also expected to reduce its full-year earnings by 30 cents per share, the company said. Whirlpool’s disappointing forecasts follows weak guidance from industrial bellwether Caterpillar and chipmaker Nvidia, both of which blamed slowing demand from world’s No.2 economy, China. The company said it expects 2019 adjusted profit to be in the range of $14 to $15 per share compared with analysts’ expectation of $15.99 and revenue of $20.3 billion, below Wall Street estimate of $20.76 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The company said higher raw material costs and tariffs resulted in softer demand in North America, its biggest segment. But still sales in the region grew about 7 percent to $3.10 billion. However, weak demand in Europe, Middle East and Africa pulled down its overall net sales by about 0.7 percent to $5.66 billion, missing analyst average estimate of $5.76 billion. In October, the U.S. manufacturer had said it would exit a number of loss-making businesses in Europe in a bid to restore profitability. In a post-earnings presentation, the company said it expected “uncertain external environment and volatility to continue”.

15.20906994918497," France fines washing machine makers $214 million for price rigging PARIS (Reuters) - France’s competition authority on Thursday fined six home appliance makers a total of 189 million euros ($214 million) for price-rigging in 2006 and 2009, the largest penalty it has handed out so far this year. Whirlpool WHR.N, Electrolux ELUXb.ST, Bosch's BSH unit ROBG.UL, Indesit, Candy Hoover and Eberhardt Frères were fined for agreeing price increases on washing machines, fridges or ovens, the competition authority said. Since these firms account for 70 percent of the French household appliances market, the cartel had a major impact on prices paid by retailers and consumers, Isabelle de Silva, who heads the Autorite de la Concurrence, said. The companies did not contest the fines and some even apologized to regulators for their behavior, de Silva said. The ruling found the companies colluded on sales prices to retailers in 2006 and in 2009 on the sidelines of official meetings of their federation the GIFAM, and in chic Parisian restaurants such as La Duree or Corona Imperial. The fines were the result of a probe started in 2012 after whistleblowers contacted French authorities. De Silva said she wanted the government to offer “some kind of reward” to whistleblowers, as happens in other countries. Whirlpool paid the biggest fine of 56 million euros while the Indesit entity - which was later bought by Whirlpool - got a separate 46 million euros fine. Electrolux was fined 48 million euros, Candy Hoover 15 million and Eberhardt Freres 1 million euros. BSH’s fine was cut by 70-80 percent from its initial amount down to 23 million euros after it helped with the inquiry. Electrolux said in a statement that its fine was below the provision of 54 million euros it had set aside. The total fine is the biggest imposed by the antitrust body in 2018. The biggest penalty imposed so far was 951.2 million euros in 2014 on a beauty products cartel."

19.06884421662264," Whirlpool counters tariff hit with price hikes, shares surge (Reuters) - U.S. home appliances maker Whirlpool WHR.N was able to counter costs arising from trade tariffs by raising prices, helping it beat Wall Street estimates for quarterly profit and driving its shares 7 percent higher on Wednesday. The company, which once welcomed President Donald Trump’s tariffs on imported washing machines, has struggled with costs from higher U.S. tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, its two chief raw materials. The tariffs, the result of a trade dispute between the United States and China, have weighed on Whirlpool’s profits in recent quarters. In response, the Michigan-based owner of brands including KitchenAid and Maytag has boosted prices of kitchen and laundry appliances. In the third quarter ended September, Whirlpool sold more of those higher-priced products, thanks to rising consumer spending on durable goods in a strengthening U.S. economy, helping outweigh the impact of tariffs to its costs. While the effect of higher prices and product mix propelled Whirlpool’s EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) margin by 2.5 percent, tariffs and raw material costs dragged margins down by 1.75 percent, the company said. Whirlpool also lifted the lower end of its 2018 adjusted earnings forecast range to $14.50 per share from $14.20. It kept the higher end unchanged at $14.80. Analysts were expecting earnings of $13.95 per share, according to Refinitiv data. Whirlpool, which does not disclose its U.S. sales, said sales from North America climbed about 5 percent to $2.99 billion during the third quarter. Net earnings available to Whirlpool fell to $210 million from $276 million a year earlier. Excluding one-time items, the company earned $4.55 per share, while overall revenue dipped 1.7 percent to $5.33 billion. Analysts had expected earnings of $3.76 per share and revenue of $5.34 billion, according to Refinitiv data. Rising concerns about the impact of trade tariffs on profit margins have weighed on the shares of U.S. manufacturers including Caterpillar CAT.N and 3M MMM.N. Whirlpool’s stock, down 38 percent this year, was last up 5.5 percent at $110 in after-hours trade."

-18.334345711626646," Whirlpool results hit by tariff-driven steel costs, shares sink (Reuters) - Home appliance manufacturer Whirlpool Corp WHR.N, an early supporter of tariffs to protect U.S. washing machines, said on Tuesday that U.S. tariffs on steel and aluminum were raising sharply the costs of raw materials, contributing to a slump in second-quarter earnings, and shares fell 15 percent to a two-year low. The Benton Harbor, Michigan-based washing machine maker could be forced to modify its current business practices, it said in a quarterly filing, without giving details. Chief Executive Marc Bitzer told investors on a call on Tuesday that rising costs in raw materials, unit volume decline and foreign currency volatility were factors in a slump in second-quarter earnings. On Monday, Whirlpool reported second-quarter profit after market close that fell short of Wall Street estimates. The company posted a net earnings loss of $657 million, or $9.50 cents per diluted share, in the quarter that ended in June, compared with $189 million, or $2.52 per share, a year earlier. The Trump administration slapped tariffs on imported washing machines earlier this year, which was expected to give Whirlpool a boost. Bitzer praised the tariffs on washing machines in January but struck a more cautious tone in April, saying the company’s raw materials costs in its U.S. laundry business had risen substantially primarily due to a separate set of tariffs on steel and aluminum. On Tuesday he said that “uncertainty related to tariffs and global trade actions have also led to increased cost of certain strategic components and finished goods import and export.” The company increased prices on its kitchen and laundry appliances earlier this year in response to rising costs. Whirlpool competitor LG Electronics Inc 066570.KS also hiked prices on washing machines in March as a result of the tariffs. Whirlpool shares fell 15 percent on Tuesday to $128.82 on the New York Stock Exchange. Analysts at Credit Suisse lowered the price target on Whirlpool to $175 from $195 after the earnings report."
