-14.062500000000005," Some U.S. companies will keep small business loans, defying backlash (Reuters) - Several publicly listed companies worth hundreds of millions of dollars said on Friday they had no plans to return funding they received under a U.S. government program providing emergency loans to small businesses, even though some of their peers have started to do so. The loans are designed to support smaller businesses - defined as having no more than 500 employees - ranging from hair dressers to landscapers to help cover employee payroll and rent, as large swaths of the economy have been shut down to keep the coronavirus from spreading. The U.S. Treasury Department said on Thursday that “big public companies with access to capital” would have a hard time proving they really needed the coronavirus relief funds, dubbed Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans. It updated its eligibility criteria, and gave companies that do not qualify until May 7 to return the aid. A handful of big public companies, some of which had qualified under a loophole in the program that defined the 500-employee limit to each location operated by a single company, responded to the public backlash by saying they were returning their loans. That included Ruth's Hospitality Group Inc RUTH.O, owner of the Chris Steakhouse chain, investment firm Manning & Napier Inc MN.N and biotechnology company Wave Life Sciences Ltd WVE.O. Restaurant operators Shake Shack Inc SHAK.N and Kura Sushi USA Inc KRUS.O returned loans from an initial tranche of the program. But others are holding fast. MiMedx Group Inc MDXG.PK, a manufacturer of biomaterials with a market value of $420 million, Digimarc Corp DMRC.O, a digital watermark provider with a market value of $197 million, and ZAGG Inc ZAGG.O, a maker of screen protectors for mobile devices with a market value of just shy of $100 million, told Reuters on Friday they took the loans because they needed them and planned to keep them. MiMedx, which took a $10 million loan, said it was in compliance with the Treasury’s loans and could not access the capital markets because it was not current in its financial statements. “COVID-19 has created operating complexities many never imagined. From sourcing material, to guarding our staff’s health and maintaining high quality production standards,” MiMedx said in a statement. Digimarc, which took a $5 million loan, said it complied with both the guidelines and the spirit of the program. “We don’t know whether the capital markets are open to us until we go there,” CEO Bruce Davis said. ZAGG, which took a $9.5 million loan, said it qualified because it met all conditions. “With extensive retail closures nationwide, our business has been severely impacted during the shutdown of all non-essential businesses due to COVID-19. We are using the money in accordance with government guidelines,” Zagg said in a statement. A Treasury spokesman declined comment. ""The risk that these companies run is that they become the poster child for greed,"" said Chas Hermann, the former chief brand officer at Noodles & Co NDLS.O who is now a marketing consultant. ""Shake Shack recognized that quickly and turned it around. It was the best move you could make after you made a really bad move."" There is more loan money coming. President Donald Trump signed a new $484 billion aid bill on Friday, the fourth passed by lawmakers to address the coronavirus crisis to fund small businesses and hospitals. It includes $310 billion for PPP loans."
-14.062500000000005," U.S. agency says no emergency small business loans for hedge funds, private equity BOSTON (Reuters) - Hedge fund and private equity firms are not eligible for the types of U.S. government loans designed to provide relief to small businesses from the economic hardship of the coronavirus outbreak, the Small Business Administration (SBA) said on Friday. “Hedge funds and private equity firms are primarily engaged in investment or speculation, and such businesses are therefore ineligible to receive a PPP (Paycheck Protection Program) loan,” the SBA wrote in an update to clarify which businesses may apply for relief under the program. The loans are designed to support smaller businesses ranging from hair dressers to restaurants to help cover employee payroll and rent, as large swaths of the economy have been shut down to keep the virus from spreading. U.S. lawmakers on Thursday approved a new $484 billion aid bill, the fourth passed to address the coronavirus crisis to fund small businesses and hospitals. It includes $310 billion for PPP loans, replenishing the program’s recently depleted $349 billion initial pot. Reuters has not been able to identify firms that may have asked for or received the loans, but bankers and lawyers said there was speculation that some financial firms had applied for the program. Many Americans expressed anger that government aid might go to these types of firms, sometimes run by billionaire founders who fly in private planes and own second and third homes in exclusive vacation enclaves. Investment advisor Aksia LLC wrote a letter to firms it invested with on April 8 saying it felt “strongly that the PPP’s loan forgiveness should not be going to alternative asset managers” whose fee revenues were not significantly impacted by the COVID-19 crisis. The SBA on Friday issued the update guidance, saying that it “does not believe that Congress intended for these types of businesses...to obtain PPP.” To be sure, not all hedge funds and private equity firms are run by wealthy financiers and some are struggling to stay in business as the historic stock market sell-off hit returns and investors have asked for their money back. As the wave of criticism grew this week, a few U.S. publicly traded companies, especially in the hospitality industry, began refusing PPP loans they were just awarded. That accelerated after the Treasury Department said on Thursday that public companies would have a hard time proving they needed the funds. One firm to turn down a PPP loan was Manning & Napier Inc MN.N, an investment firm but not a hedge fund manager. The company, which had $17 billion under management as of March 31, said on Thursday it had ""immediately rescinded"" its already approved applications for $6.7 million in PPP loans for two subsidiaries following the new SBA guidance."
-8.552631578947375," More U.S. companies return payroll loans after new Treasury guidance WASHINGTON/BOSTON (Reuters) - U.S. companies on Thursday began refusing government loans they were just awarded, after the Treasury Department said that publicly traded firms would have a hard time proving they really needed the coronavirus relief funds. The about-face underscores problems with the way the Treasury’s Payroll Protection Program (PPP), designed to keep American workers on company payrolls and off unemployment during coronavirus-related lockdowns, was structured and rolled out. Some large well-funded companies were granted millions of dollars from the $350 billion pool of funding, while many small, mom-and-pop shops were unable to access any funding at all, sparking public outrage. “Under the rubric of helping small businesses on Main Street, well-intentioned programs like PPP have ended up helping medium and big companies,” said Aaron Klein, a fellow at the Brookings Institution. The initial PPP funding was snapped up in less than two weeks by millions of small and mid-sized businesses, including restaurant chains Potbelly Corp PBPB.O and steakhouse operator Ruth Hospitality Group RUTH.O and a coal mine. Congress has now approved an additional $310 billion. [nL2N2CB0JC] Under the original guidance from the Treasury Department, companies applying for PPP loans had to certify that “current economic uncertainty makes the loan necessary to support ... ongoing operations.” In new Frequently Asked Questions guidance updated on Thursday, Treasury said many of those companies would not be able to certify in their loan applications that funds were “necessary” for continued operations because they were already well-financed. “It is unlikely that a public company with substantial market value and access to capital markets will be able to make the required certification in good faith,” the Treasury said. The department went on to say that borrowers that returned loan money by May 7 “will be deemed by the Small Business Administration to have made the required certification in good faith.” The new guidance prompted the program's largest recipient, the Ruth's Chris Steakhouse chain RUTH.O to say it would quickly repay its $20 million loan to maintain its payroll during coronavirus-prompted shutdowns. Manning & Napier Inc MN.N, a Fairpoint, New York, investment firm that managed $17 billion as of March 31, also said that it had ""immediately rescinded"" its already approved applications for $6.7 million in PPP loans for two subsidiaries following the new guidance for public companies from Treasury. Manning & Napier had said on Wednesday that the loans, obtained through Buffalo, New York-based M&T Bank Corp MTB.N would be ""used to help support payroll costs and rent expense."" The company, which remains in operation, previously disclosed that compensation and related costs for its 307 employees was $81 million for 2019, an average of about $264,000 per employee. A spokesman for the investment firm did not respond to requests for additional comment. Two other public companies that borrowed under the initial tranche, Shake Shack Inc SHAK.N and Kura Sushi USA Inc, KRUS.O, earlier returned the funds. [nL2N2CA0O9] About $550 million of the first round of forgivable loans went to more than 150 publicly traded companies that had qualified under size guidelines in the statute. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin warned on Wednesday that companies that received the rescue money intended for small businesses could be investigated. He told Fox Business Network it was “questionable” whether larger firms had qualified for loans based on a self-certification step in the application process. [nL2N2CA0O9] The FAQ update made it clear that the Treasury was looking hard at the step in which a small business “must certify in good faith that their PPP loan request is necessary.” “Specifically, before submitting a PPP application, all borrowers should review carefully the required certification that ‘current economic uncertainty makes this loan request necessary to support the ongoing operations of the applicant,’” it said."
