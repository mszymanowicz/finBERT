20.334940579709794," BNY Mellon, Google Cloud technology to predict Treasury settlement failures (Reuters) - The Bank of New York Mellon Corp said on Thursday it has partnered with Google Cloud on technology that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning to predict when BNY Mellon’s clients’ U.S. Treasury transactions will fail to settle. Settlement failures occur when two parties buying and selling bonds fail to exchange the cash and securities on time. A large increase in failures can signal market liquidity problems. The $22 trillion U.S. Treasury market is the largest and most liquid market in the world. Around 2% of transactions fail to settle each day, which can create liquidity shortfalls for clients, BNY Mellon said in a release. BNY Mellon said its new technology predicts the likelihood that clients, such as banks, will face settlement failure on a trade. The model can predict around 40% of settlement failures for trades that are eligible to be settled on the Federal Reserve’s FedWire Securities Service, with an accuracy of 90%, it said. The technology analyzes supply and demand and the velocity of trading in specific securities, and it models specific counterparty activity, among other factors, BNY Mellon said.

22.96896464840507," Global banks seek to contain damage over $2 trillion of suspicious transfers HONG KONG/LONDON (Reuters) - Global banks faced a fresh scandal about dirty money on Monday as they sought to limit the fallout from a cache of leaked documents showing they transferred more than $2 trillion in suspect funds over nearly two decades. Britain-based HSBC Holdings Plc HSBA.L, Standard Chartered Plc STAN.L and Barclays Plc BARC.L, Germany's Deutsche Bank AG DBKGn.DE and Commerzbank AG CBKG.DE, and U.S.-headquartered JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N and Bank of New York Mellon Corp BK.N were among the lenders named in the report by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists and based on leaked documents obtained by BuzzFeed News. The report was based on 2,100 leaked suspicious activity reports (SARs), covering transactions between 1999 and 2017, filed by banks and other financial firms with the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). Banks are required to file an SAR whenever handling funds that cause grounds for suspicion of criminal activity. While some banks said many of the transactions happened a long time ago, and they had since put robust checks in place, the reports revealed broader problems with the monitoring system at the heart of global policing of money laundering and other criminal activity. The reports drew calls from some industry groups and activists for reforms. Investors worried about the potential fallout for global banks, many of which have faced hefty fines in the past for lapses in controls and spent billions of dollars to bolster compliance. “It confirms what we already knew: that there are huge amounts of SARs being filed with relatively low numbers of cases brought through to prosecution,” said Etelka Bogardi, a Hong Kong-based financial services partner at Norton Rose Fulbright. “It also brings out the point that managing financial crime risk goes beyond making SARs,” Bogardi said. The Institute of International Finance, an industry group, called for reforms. “There is a balance to be struck between managing financial crime risk and ensuring access to the financial system for legitimate customers,” the IIF said. Policymakers, regulators and banks have long acknowledged fundamental flaws in the anti-money laundering system. The rules around what is deemed “suspicious” can be vague, which leads some banks to send too many reports and others to send too few. And the enforcement group is understaffed to handle the millions of SARs that need to be analyzed to determine whether a crime has been committed. HSBC and StanChart shares touched their lowest level in as much as 25 years, although they fared little worse than their peers amid a wider sell-off in global stocks. JPMorgan and Bank of New York Mellon, which were also in the top five banks mentioned most frequently in the SARs, fell more than 3% each during trading in New York. Shares of Deutsche Bank, which was involved in the largest number of SARs in BuzzFeed’s dossier, were down more than 8% at one point on Monday morning following the reports. Several analysts, however, played down the scale of problems. “Unless there are more substantive allegations of fact, we expect that this article will not have lasting impacts on the industry or stock prices,” Chris Kotowski, analyst at Oppenheimer, wrote in a note. Bank shares were also pressured on Monday by other news, including worries about the resurgence of the coronavirus in Europe. (Graphic: Deutsche Bank shares plunge - ) Deutsche Bank said the issues raised in the media reports were “historic,” while the German Finance Ministry said on Monday that the cases linked to Germany in the reports had already been dealt with. HSBC also said the information in the reports was historic, while Standard Chartered pointed to recent investments to improve its control procedures. BNY Mellon said it fully complied with all “all applicable laws and regulations.” JPMorgan said it has “thousands of people and hundreds of millions of dollars dedicated to this important work.” Many of the suspicious transactions were linked to companies incorporated in Britain or offshore British territories, prompting calls from action groups for tougher rules. “If the government cares at all about the UK’s reputation globally, it must stop rolling out the red carpet to the criminal and corrupt, and refuse to legitimize their money through our companies and banks,” Global Witness said. The UK government said it was working on reforms to its corporate registry system that will require more checks on company directors. (Graphic: HSBC, Standard Chartered lag broader European bank index this year - ) Global banks in recent years have boosted investments in technology and staff to deal with tighter anti-money laundering and sanctions regulatory requirements across the world. Thousands of clients were booted out of bank accounts in major wealth hubs including Hong Kong and Singapore after a money laundering scandal in Malaysia, the “Panama Papers” expose, and a global push for tax transparency. Compliance experts said that part of the problem now was banks were struggling to distinguish between transactions that were and were not suspicious, so were simply filing millions of SARs that enforcement agencies lack the capacity to deal with. “Lots of banks are struggling with high false positive rates and the backlog (of existing cases). That’s why you see that sometimes SARs were raised over 100 days after the transaction,” said Cliff Lam, a director at AlixPartners in Hong Kong."
22.96896464840507," Keys takeaways from the FinCen Files (Reuters) - Shares of the biggest global banks dropped on Monday after news reports said they allowed large sums of allegedly illicit funds to move through the financial system, despite red flags about the origins of the money. Britain-based HSBC Holdings PLC and Standard Chartered PLC fell to 25-year lows, while U.S. banks JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of New York Mellon Corp were down 4.1% and 4.7%, respectively. These lenders were named in recent articles by BuzzFeed News and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, based on leaked documents, known as the FinCEN Files. Here are the key takeaways from the reports: 1. What are the FinCEN Files? The investigative series is named after the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, which receives alerts from banks and other financial firms about transactions that appear to be questionable. Those alerts are called suspicious activity reports, or SARs. Financial institutions filed SARs for more than $2 trillion worth of transactions between 1999 and 2017, according to the reports. The leaked files pertained to roughly 2,100 SARs filed with FinCEN between 2011 and 2017, representing less than 0.02% of the more than 12 million SARs during that time. Among the types of transactions highlighted by the report: funds processed by JPMorgan for potentially corrupt individuals and companies in Venezuela, Ukraine and Malaysia; money from a Ponzi scheme moving through HSBC; and money linked to a Ukrainian billionaire processed by Deutsche Bank AG. 2. Why would a transaction be deemed “suspicious”? U.S. federal laws require certain financial institutions to file SARs if there are signs of money laundering, insider trading, cyber attacks or various types of fraud. The existence of a report does not confirm wrongdoing, but alerts regulators to possible criminal activity. Banks, money exchanges, securities brokers, insurance companies, casinos and other financial institutions are required to file SARs within 60 days of detection, according to the Treasury Department. 3. What went wrong? U.S. agencies tasked with enforcing money-laundering laws rarely took any action after receiving SARs, nor did big banks after filing them, according to the FinCEN Files. As a result, the millions of suspicious activity reports had little-to-no effect on policing the global financial system, the articles said. 4. What does it mean for banks? It is not entirely clear what negative consequences, if any, banks highlighted in the FinCen Files stories may face. Analysts on Monday said the revelations were unlikely to lead to additional regulatory penalties or fines, because the behavior detailed in the articles showed that the system is flawed, but did not make clear that the banks had broken any rules or laws. It is possible that some banks with dated technology may have to spend more money improving compliance systems, and that politicians who typically criticize the industry will scrutinize the matter further, but there was no immediate sign that was happening yet. “Unless there are more substantive allegations of fact, we expect that (these articles) will not have lasting impacts on the industry or stock prices,” Oppenheimer analyst Chris Kotowski wrote in a note to clients."

Big U.S. banks that reported results earlier this week also highlighted the hit from lower interest rates after the U.S. Federal Reserve cut borrowing costs three times last year against the backdrop of the prolonged U.S.-China trade war. “Although we continue to be negatively impacted by lower rates, a flat yield curve and low foreign exchange volatility, we remain intensely focused on carefully managing costs,” interim Chief Executive Officer Todd Gibbons said in a statement. Interest revenue at BNY Mellon fell 8% to $815 million in the fourth quarter, while non-interest expenses declined 1%. BNY Mellon has been investing in technology to automate most of its processes and cut costs, a strategy put in place by former Chief Executive Charles Scharf before he left to take up the top job at Wells Fargo WFC.N late last year. The bank, which manages money of clients such as big banks and hedge funds, said fee revenue rose 26% due to a gain from the sale of an unspecified investment. Fee revenue was flat excluding the one-time benefit. Assets under custody and administration rose 4% to $37.1 trillion in the reported quarter, from the prior quarter. The bank said net income applicable to common shareholders rose to $1.39 billion, or $1.52 per share, in the last three months of 2019, from $832 million, or 84 cents per share, a year earlier.

5.839436982896813," BNY Mellon beats profit estimates on cost controls (Reuters) - Bank of New York Mellon Corp BK.N reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Wednesday, as the world's largest custodian bank cut costs to counter weakness in its investment management business and lower interest rates. Fee revenue fell 1%, hurt by outflows since the third quarter of last year, lower performance earnings and a stronger dollar. Investment management clients have turned cautious in the wake on the trade wars between Beijing and Washington that have rattled financial markets and throttled global economic growth. “Interest rate headwinds and deposit mix continue to challenge net interest revenue and asset management continues to be negatively impacted by prior-year outflows,” Interim Chief Executive Officer Todd Gibbons said in a statement. Gibbons took the helm after Charles Scharf left to take up the top job at Wells Fargo WFC.N. The bank, which gets bulk of its revenue from managing money of clients such as big banks and hedge funds, said net interest revenue fell 18% to $730 million, hurt in part by a lease-related impairment of $70 million, higher interest-bearing deposit and funding costs. The U.S. central bank cut rates twice in the third quarter, after having raised them nine times since 2015. Net income applicable to common shareholders fell to $1 billion in the third quarter ended Sept.30, from $1.08 billion a year earlier. On a per share basis, net income rose to $1.07 from $1.06, reflecting buybacks that have lowered the number of shares. Total revenue fell 5% to $3.86 billion.

-8.219381153462978," BNY Mellon expects net interest revenue to drop again, shares slide (Reuters) - Bank of New York Mellon Corp said on Wednesday it expects net interest revenue to decline again in the current quarter as the world’s largest custodian bank pays higher interest rates to attract deposits, sending its shares down 9 percent. The U.S. Federal Reserve in March did an about-turn on its campaign to raise interest rates and now sees no hikes this year on risks to the economy from a global slowdown. “While the current expectations for the yield curve will likely negatively impact our revenue growth for the next several quarters, we will remain disciplined on expenses..,” said Chief Executive Officer Charlie Scharf. Scharf said competition for deposits was still high, and that the bank expected the rate it paid on deposits to increase a little. The bank, which gets bulk of its revenue from managing money of clients such as big banks and hedge funds, said it expects second-quarter net interest revenue to fall between 3 percent and 5 percent, from the prior quarter. Net interest revenue fell 8.5 percent to $841 million in the first quarter from a year earlier. “We see flat revenues for BNY in 2019, and additional pressure on the company and its new(ish) CEO to produce more measurable turnaround results,” said Cathy Seifert, an analyst with CFRA Research. BNY also posted its first quarterly profit miss in two years, as calmer markets in the first three months of the year after a volatile December led to a slowdown in client activity, causing a 9 percent drop in fee revenue to $3.03 billion. The company’s asset servicing revenue fell 7.4 percent to $1.41 billion, while asset management revenue dropped 17 percent to $637 million. Overall revenue fell 6.7 percent to $3.90 billion, missing analysts’ average estimate of $4 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The bank’s weak revenue overwhelmed its management of expenses, said Susan Roth Katzke, an analyst at Credit Suisse.

A disciplinary tribunal will be convened to decide what sanctions should be imposed, the FRC said, adding that no client money or assets were lost as a result of the misconduct. The accounting watchdog, which issued new so-called CASS guidance for client assets reports in 2011, has already responded to pressure to crack down on auditors and imposed larger fines for misconduct or failings. KPMG and Hinton failed to give adequate consideration on whether the records of custody relationships maintained by BNY Mellon were compliant with certain rules, the FRC said on Wednesday. ‘REGRET’ “We accept and regret that our work did not fully reflect all aspects of this new (CASS) guidance,” KPMG said in an email. “There has been further fundamental change in the regulatory environment and we have significantly enhanced our CASS procedures and training to reflect this.” KPMG partner Hinton did not respond immediately to a request for comment via the LinkedIN social network. The firm said it had cooperated with the FRC but could not agree with the watchdog on the level of appropriate sanctions. KPMG also emphasised that no clients suffered actual financial or other loss. The FRC told Reuters that there is no upper limit to any financial penalty the tribunal might impose and that the largest fine issued under the relevant guidance scheme was 10 million pounds. A spokeswoman for BNY Mellon, which was fined 126 million pounds ($166 million) in 2015 for failing to keep customer money safe during the financial crisis, said: “BNY Mellon is aware of the conclusions from the Financial Reporting Council’s investigation ... We have no comment to make.” KPMG and rivals PwC, EY and Deloitte have all caught the attention of the FRC after the collapse of large British companies such as Carillion CLLN.L and Poundworld raised questions over standards in the auditing industry. The FRC is investigating KPMG’s audit of drinks firm Conviviality’s financial statements after highlighting an “unacceptable deterioration” in the auditor’s work with top British firms. KPMG is also being investigated over its work for construction company Carillion. The watchdog fined KPMG 3 million pounds this year for misconduct related to auditing of British fashion retailer Ted Baker's TED.L accounts and has said that a higher than usual number of the accountant's 2018/19 audits would face FRC scrutiny."

-9.634360498999039," BNY Mellon shares drop on client losses (Reuters) - Bank of New York Mellon Corp's BK.N second-quarter outflows more than doubled, as the world's largest custodian bank said it lost two clients and warned that the departures would impact results in the next few quarters. The company’s shares fell as much as 6 percent on Thursday, their biggest percentage drop in two years. Chief Executive Officer Charles Scharf did not identify the two clients on a conference call with analysts, but said the company was working to add new clients, which would help it mitigate the exits. “While these losses will impact us on a year-over-year basis for the next few quarters, we are also in the process of onboarding several large clients, which will positively impact our results, starting predominantly in the second half of next year,” Scharf said. Total net outflows rose to $26 billion from $10 billion in the first quarter. “Weak revenue growth and outflows in asset management business because of loss in clients are making the investors unhappy,” said Jeffery Harte, analyst at Sandler O’Neill & Partners. BNY Mellon reported a better-than-expected second quarter profit, helped by higher fee revenue and lower income tax provision. Provision for income tax fell 14 percent to $286 million in the quarter from a year earlier. Fee revenue rose 3 percent to $3.21 billion, as the company benefited from higher interest rates and equity markets. The bank said net income applicable to common shareholders jumped 14 percent to $1.06 billion, or $1.03 per share, in the quarter ended June 30. Analysts on average had expected earnings of $1.02 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total revenue rose 4.6 percent to $4.14 billion. Non-interest expenses increased 3.4 percent to $2.75 billion because of a weak dollar. Assets under custody and administration rose to $33.6 trillion from $33.5 trillion in the first quarter."
