83.91080360527106," UPDATE 1-Marathon Oil posts fourth straight quarterly loss on virus hit (Adds background) Nov 4 (Reuters) - U.S. shale producer Marathon Oil Corp reported a fourth straight quarterly loss on Wednesday, as the COVID-19 pandemic hammered demand for fuel and dented crude prices. U.S. oil prices have plunged 38% this year as the virus outbreak led to grounding of flights and brought economies to a standstill, but with the easing of coronavirus-induced curbs, demand has begun to pick up and crude prices have rebounded from historic lows. However, the nascent recovery has since been threatened by new cases of virus infections and fresh lockdowns. The company’s total net production fell to 370,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), from 426,000 boepd a year earlier. Marathon reported a loss of $317 million, or 40 cents per share, for the quarter ended Sept. 30, compared to a profit of $165 million, or 21 cents per share, a year earlier.

The oil and gas producer cut its costs and expenses by 17.2% to $975 million as the average realized price for its U.S. crude oil and condensate fell 63.4% to $21.65 per barrel. U.S. crude prices remain about 32% lower from January levels despite a recent rally, as COVID-19 drained demand and a battle for market share among the world’s top producers flooded the market with oil. However, with oil prices having rebounded from a dip into negative territory, Marathon raised its production guidance to 190,000 net barrels of oil per day at mid-point, inclusive of year-to-date curtailment. It also cut its full-year capital expenditure to $1.2 billion from $1.3 billion. Permian producer Parsley Energy Inc also narrowed its 2020 capital budget to between $650 million and $700 million from less than $700 million previously, however it did not reinstate its production guidance citing ongoing uncertainty caused by the coronavirus.

1.4285709121511143," Producers Marathon Oil, Pioneer rush to save cash as oil slump bites (Reuters) - Marathon Oil Corp MRO.N and Pioneer Natural Resources Co PXD.N on Wednesday detailed new plans to cut costs, as the U.S. oil producers seek ways to overcome a slump in crude prices due to excess supply and a plunge in demand owed to the COVID-19 pandemic. Shale producers have been forced to cut expenses and shore up cash as crude prices have slumped due to a month-long price war between top producers Saudi Arabia and Russia, made worse by the COVID-19 pandemic. North American oil and gas producers have cut their 2020 spending by nearly 34%, or about $41.6 billion, from their original estimates, according to data compiled by Reuters. Pioneer now expects 2020 capital expenditure between $1.4 billion and $1.6 billion, down from its prior estimates of $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion and 55% lower than its original budget. The company’s production for the year is now expected to be between 341,000 to 359,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, about 11% lower from the midpoint of its previous estimates. The forecast includes a voluntary cut of about 7,000 barrels of oil per day, Pioneer said. Marathon, which has slashed spending twice within 30 days, suspended bit.ly/2YGfTl2 its quarterly dividend and share repurchase program as it swung to an adjusted loss in the first quarter and said it expected $350 million in annualized cost reductions. “We’re dramatically reducing our capital expenditures, including a pause in virtually all completion activity during second quarter, and we will continue to optimize our capital program in response to market conditions,” Marathon Chief Executive Officer Lee Tillman said. Most shale companies need prices above $40 per barrel to break even on costs at the well. U.S. crude CLc1, which has fallen about 60% this year, was trading at over $23 per barrel on Wednesday. Marathon’s steps to bring down costs also include management pay cuts and reduction in its employee and contractor base by 16% and 70% respectively."

Marathon Oil now expects to spend about $1.3 billion in 2020, $1.1 billion lower than its original forecast and $600 million below its estimate provided in March. The company plans to suspend further drilling activity in the Northern Delaware region of the Permian basin, the largest U.S. shale basin, with only a limited number of wells producing through the rest of the year.

-48.42257335030198," Marathon Oil profit misses estimates on lower oil, gas prices (Reuters) - Marathon Oil Corp's MRO.N quarterly profit missed analysts' estimates on Wednesday, as tumbling oil and gas prices more than offset the benefits of robust U.S. shale production. Marathon’s results mirrored weaker earnings across the sector, as prices of global crude fell in the quarter on oversupply and demand concerns, fueled by fears of slowing global economic growth. The company said average realized prices for crude oil and condensate in the United States fell 2.1% to $54.83 per barrel. The company, which expects its 2020 capital budget to be $2.4 billion, forecast U.S. oil production growth of 6% in 2020.

10.962785751992406," Marathon's board backs CEO amid calls for his ouster (Reuters) - Marathon Petroleum Corp said on Friday the top U.S. refiner’s board supported Gary Heminger staying on as chief executive officer amid calls for his ouster from two top 10 shareholders. The demand from shareholders Paul Foster and Jeff Stevens comes when Marathon is already under pressure after activist investor Elliott Management Corp revived its call for the company to be split into three. Foster and Stevens, who together own about 1.7% of Marathon, agreed with ""the majority"" of Elliott's proposals, but said an immediate management change was necessary to boost shareholder value. (bwnews.pr/2lFV9ck) Billionaire Paul Singer’s Elliott, which owned 0.7% of Marathon as of June 30, according to Refinitiv data, has argued a split would boost shareholder value by as much as $40 billion. Marathon said the board firmly and unanimously supported Heminger, who has been the chairman and chief executive officer since the company separated from Marathon Oil Corp in 2011. In a separate letter to employees on Friday, Heminger defended Marathon's business model. (bit.ly/2mlFSh1) The CEO said Marathon has generated more cost savings than initially expected from its $23 billion merger with rival Andeavor last year to become the top U.S. refiner by capacity. Additionally, Heminger said he was open to meeting with shareholders, responding to the claim of Foster and Stevens that he had resisted change. Heminger’s membership of the board is due up for shareholder vote in 2020, according to Marathon’s 2019 proxy statement. Shareholders had at the 2018 annual meeting rejected a proposal for an independent chairman. Elliott said its call to separate Marathon’s retail, refining and midstream assets was prompted by the company’s failure to deliver on past promises and “chronic underperformance.” The statement from Foster and Stevens, both former board members at Andeavor, is the second example in recent months of executives from energy companies merged into a rival returning to voice concern over performance following the combination. Toby and Derek Rice led a successful proxy contest in July to gain control of EQT Corp, two years after selling the business they founded, Rice Energy, to EQT for $6.7 billion. Another Marathon shareholder, DE Shaw & Co, has backed Elliott’s call to split the company. DE Shaw has a 0.9% stake in Marathon, according to Refinitiv data. Marathon’s shares were trading 2.5% lower at %62.38 on Friday. They have fallen about 6% this year, compared with a 7.4% gain in the S&P oil and gas refining and marketing index. At the year’s low of $43.96 in August, its shares touched 2016 levels. Marathon is the largest refiner by operating capacity, and the second-largest refiner by market capitalization, lagging Phillips 66, which also operates chemical plants."
11.593775555755444," Elliott revives call to split Marathon Petroleum into three (Reuters) - Elliott Management Corp on Wednesday urged Marathon Petroleum Corp MPC.N to split into three companies, saying it would boost shareholder value by as much as $40 billion, three years after the activist hedge fund asked the refiner to consider spinning off businesses. Shares of Marathon, which has a market capitalization of about $36 billion, were up 8.1% at $59.97. Elliott said its call to separate Marathon’s retail, refining and midstream assets was prompted by the company’s failure to deliver on past promises and “chronic underperformance.” The company’s shares have fallen 6% this year, compared with a 7.4% gain in the S&P oil and gas refining and marketing index. At the year’s low of $43.96 in August, its shares touched 2016 levels. Under Elliott’s latest plan, Marathon’s transportation and storage business will become MPLX, a company with an enterprise value of more than $50 billion. Its refining business will be the “New Marathon” with an enterprise value of $29 billion, while its retail business will become Speedway worth about $18 billion. Marathon said it was focused on increasing shareholder value and would “thoroughly evaluate” Elliott’s proposal. The hedge fund, founded by billionaire Paul Singer, said on Wednesday it had accepted a “compromise” last time around after “extensive” talks in which Marathon agreed to simplify its midstream business and undertake a strategic review of its Speedway assets. After the review, the refiner chose to keep its Speedway retail arm, a decision then backed by Elliott. Marathon later bought rival Andeavor to become the top U.S. refiner and earlier this year completed the merger of midstream units MPLX MPLX.N and Andeavor Logistics LP ANDX.N in a $9 billion deal. Elliott, which owned 0.7% of Marathon as of June 30, according to Refinitiv data, said it estimated a $22 billion boost to shareholder value from the split and another $17 billion if refining, retailing and marketing operations were to be improved after the separation. Shareholder DE Shaw, which has a stake of about 0.9% in Marathon, according to Refinitiv data, has backed Elliott’s call to split the company, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. Marathon Chairman and Chief Executive Gary Heminger could become a target for disgruntled shareholders, given he has overseen the company since Marathon Petroleum was separated from Marathon Oil Corp MRO.N in 2011. Heminger’s membership of Marathon’s board of directors is due up for shareholder vote in 2020, according to Marathon’s 2019 proxy statement. At the 2018 annual meeting, shareholders rejected a proposal to create an independent chairman position. “At this stage, Elliott’s going to have a lot of support, and it is going to be harder for Marathon to fight this,” said Matthew Blair, an analyst at Tudor, Pickering & Holt. The energy brokerage, which has a “buy” rating and a $69 price target on the stock, had called for the sale of one of Marathon’s refineries and the gathering and processing business of MPLX. Blair called Elliott’s demands unsurprising, although the proposal to split the company into three was “a little bit more extreme” than expected."

The company has been looking to divest its North Sea assets and focus on the rising shale oil production in the United States. The U.S. recently surpassed Saudi Arabia and Russia to become the world’s top crude producer. Houston-based Marathon said production from the Bakken shale jumped 37 percent to 94,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d). North Dakota’s Bakken is the country’s third-largest shale oil field and extracting crude there is cheaper than the top Permian, making it an attractive bet for oil producers. Rival Occidental Petroleum Corp reported better-than-expected earnings on Tuesday, while Hess Corp posted a smaller-than-expected loss last month. For 2019, Marathon forecast total production between 410,000 boe/d and 430,000 boe/d, with U.S. production of 320,000 boe/d to 330,000 boe/d. However, a nearly 30 percent drop in oil prices from October highs on the back of oversupply concerns has led to producers cutting back on capital expenditure. Marathon expects to spend $2.6 billion in 2019, down nearly 6 percent from last year.

-38.879433104380226," Exclusive: Marathon Oil looks to exit North Sea, joining other U.S. rivals LONDON (Reuters) - Marathon Oil has launched the sale of its British North Sea oil and gas fields, a document seen by Reuters showed, the latest U.S. firm to retreat from the basin to focus on onshore shale production at home. The sale includes stakes in the BP-operated Foinaven fields in the west of Shetland area as well as interests in the Brae complex northeast of Aberdeen, according to a sales document seen by Reuters. The process, launched this week, is being run by Jefferies and bids are due by December. The assets could fetch up to $200 million, according to two banking sources. Marathon Oil joins several companies including Chevron, ConocoPhillips and EOG Resources that have sought to pull out of the North Sea in recent years as they focus operations on rapidly expanding shale production. Marathon Oil spokeswoman Lee Warren declined to comment directly on the sale but said “portfolio management is an ongoing and integral element of our successful business model as we continue to simplify and concentrate our portfolio to our highest return opportunities with a focus on our differentiated position in the U.S. resource plays.” The company, which produced around 419,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day in the second quarter, will invest over 90 percent of its 2018 capital in U.S. shale production, according to its website. The North Sea, one of the oldest offshore basins that started production in the 1970s, has undergone a broad change of guard in recent years as veteran producers have been replaced by smaller, often privately-owned companies, which say they can squeeze more oil and gas out of the fields. According to the sales document, Marathon’s North Sea assets have a total production of 15,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, a resource of 31 million barrels and are expected to produce $85 million of cash flow in 2019. Marathon holds a 40 percent stake in the Brae Area complex, one of the oldest in the basin, as well as stakes in pipelines. One of the complex’s platforms, Brae Bravo, is being dismantled after production ceased in recent years in what is known as decommissioning. The Foinaven area comprises of two producing fields, Foinaven and Foinaven East, in which Marathon holds 28 percent and 47 percent interests respectively, the document said. Marathon agreed to sell its Libyan assets to France’s Total earlier this year for $450 million."
