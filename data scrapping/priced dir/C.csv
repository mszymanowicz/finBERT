17.044343120991893," Citigroup considering divestiture of some foreign consumer units - Bloomberg Law (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc is considering divesting some international consumer units, Bloomberg Law reported on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter. The discussions are around divesting units across retail banking in the Asia-Pacific region, the report bit.ly/3pD57WP said. “As our incoming CEO Jane Fraser said in January, we are undertaking a dispassionate and thorough review of our strategy,” a Citigroup spokesperson told Reuters. “Many different options are being considered and we will take the right amount of time before making any decisions.” The move, part of Fraser’s attempt to simplify the bank, can see units in South Korea, Thailand, the Philippines and Australia being divested, the Bloomberg report said. However, no decision has been made, according to the report. Revenue from Citi’s consumer banking business in Asia declined 15% to $1.55 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020. The divestitures could be spaced out over time or the bank could end up keeping all of its existing units, the Bloomberg report said. The firm is also reviewing consumer operations in Mexico, though a sale there is less likely, the report said, citing one of the people. Last month, New York-based Citigroup beat profit estimates but issued a gloomy forecast for expenses. Finance head Mark Mason said the lender's expenses could rise in 2021 in the range of 2% to 3%, weighing on its operating margins. (reut.rs/2ZwXRB1)"

The lender said it has 8,500 employees in Texas. The historic winter storm in Texas caused five days of blackouts before the state’s embattled power grid finally sprang back to life.

21.58209243665927," Citigroup cannot recoup Revlon payouts after nearly $900 million gaffe: U.S. judge NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Tuesday said Citigroup Inc C.N is not entitled to recoup half a billion dollars of its own money that it mistakenly wired lenders of Revlon Inc, in what he called ""a banking error of perhaps unprecedented nature and magnitude."" U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman in Manhattan said the Aug. 11, 2020, transfers were “final and complete transactions, not subject to revocation.” Citigroup plans to appeal. “We believe we are entitled to the funds and will continue to pursue a complete recovery of them,” a spokeswoman said. The blunder was the latest misstep involving internal controls at Citigroup, which federal regulators fined $400 million in October over longstanding deficiencies. Acting as Revlon’s loan agent, Citigroup had wired $893 million to the cosmetic company’s lenders, appearing to pay off a loan not due until 2023, when it intended to send only a $7.8 million interest payment. The New York-based bank blamed human error for the gaffe, and some lenders returned money they were sent. But 10 asset managers, including Brigade Capital Management, HPS Investment Partners and Symphony Asset Management, refused, and Citigroup sued to recoup approximately $501 million they received. The bank said Revlon’s lenders knew or should have known the transfers were a mistake, and that Revlon, controlled by billionaire Ron Perelman, could not afford such a big payment. But in a 101-page decision, following a six-day trial in December, Furman said the transfers were a “discharge for value,” matching “to the penny” what the lenders were owed. “The non-returning lenders believed, and were justified in believing, that the payments were intentional,” Furman wrote. “To believe otherwise - to believe that Citibank, one of the most sophisticated financial institutions in the world, had made a mistake that had never happened before, to the tune of nearly $1 billion - would have been borderline irrational.” Furman left in place a temporary ban on the lenders’ using the transferred funds, reflecting Citigroup’s expected appeal. In a joint statement, the lenders’ lawyers Adam Abensohn and Robert Loigman said they were “extremely pleased” with the decision. Administrative agents typically distribute interest payments and perform back-office services for clients. Industry groups have said a ruling against Citigroup could expose banks to excessive liability risks. The Loan Syndications and Trading Association, whose roughly 530 members include Citigroup and some Revlon creditors, said such a ruling could destabilize the $1.2 trillion U.S. syndicated loan market. Shortfalls in Citigroup’s internal controls were a factor in Chief Executive Mike Corbat’s planned early retirement this month.

21.58209243665927," Citi takes profits in South Africa currency trade LONDON (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc said on Tuesday it was booking a profit in its three-month bet on the South African rand versus the U.S. dollar. The rand touched a new one-year high of 14.4300 in thin trade and was last 0.2% higher on the day, spurred by faith in South Africa’s economy and global risk appetite as investors bet on a faster economic recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic. Citi said it was taking profit on its three-month USD/ZAR put spread of 14.00 to 14.50, giving a total profit of 1.26% of the notional value. It purchased the put spread on Jan. 20. “It has been an extraordinary performance in the ZAR, strongly supported by residual current account rebalancing forces, solid metal and mining terms of trade trends, and a sense of reflation and cyclically in global macro investment trends,” Luis Costa, emerging markets strategist at Citi, wrote in a research note. “But not everything is rosy. There is a point at which the underlying very weak growth trend and its fiscal implications could start impacting the ZAR in a negative way.” Hopes of faster economic momentum in South Africa in 2021 have been raised by recent data showing better-than-expected expansion in industrial production and an inching up in mining output. Finance Minister Tito Mboweni is set to deliver the 2021 budget on Feb. 24, showing better-than-forecast revenue collection. Citi said the potential for a lowering in issuance of South Africa government bonds had already been partially absorbed by the market. South Africa looked set for “erratic growth trends” in 2021, due to weakness in the government’s vaccination plans, Citi added."
19.855065180865815," Germany's Rocket Internet aims for SPAC in New York, sources say FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German tech investment company Rocket Internet plans to list a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) in New York to tap into investor interest in new offerings, two people close to the matter said. Rocket, led by tech entrepreneur Oliver Samwer, is preparing to list SPAC shares worth $200 million to $300 million in a deal organised by investment bank Citi, they said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Rocket and Citi were not immediately available for comment. SPACs, or blank-cheque firms, typically raise money in an IPO to pursue an acquisition without telling their investors which company they will buy. The deal then takes the private company public. The United States has seen a boom in SPCA listings, while there have been relatively in Europe. So far, stand-outs in Europe include telecom entrepreneur Xavier Neil’s 2MX Organic in Paris, and ESG Core Investments earlier this month announced plans to list in Amsterdam. Some of the blank-cheque companies backed by European entrepreneurs, including former Credit Suisse CEO Tidjane Thiam or Egyptian billionaire Nassef Onsi Sawiris, have chosen to seek a U.S. listing. Oliver Samwer’s Rocket Internet is pursuing a similar strategy, as he aims for the deeper U.S. market in which investors are more used to SPACs. In January, the amount raised by SPACs globally soared 20 times to $24 billion from a year earlier, Refinitiv data showed. Rocket Internet in September announced plans to delist its shares, saying it had sufficient access to capital outside the stock exchange and could better pursue a long-term approach to investing. Investors had long said Rocket Internet would be better off going private again as it had successfully listed all the major firms it helped to found, including Delivery Hero, HelloFresh and Home.

18.181228931200327," Citi's incoming CEO Fraser forms new operating team to build leadership accountability (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc’s incoming chief executive officer Jane Fraser said on Tuesday she has decided to form a new global operating team to build accountability among its top leaders. “A key element of our Transformation work is to hold our business leaders accountable not only for the performance of their own teams, but for how we collectively operate our firm and deliver the outcomes for which we are responsible,” Fraser said in a memo. The team will consist of Fraser’s executive management team, the group’s treasurer and leaders of Citigroup’s various units, including its investment-banking unit, Global Wealth operations and U.S. consumer unit. Fraser added that Sunil Garg, global head of Citi Commercial Bank, will become the next CEO of Citibank, upon current Citigroup CEO Michael Corbat’s retirement. “Sunil also will chair the Risk and Controls project group of our Transformation effort,” the memo said. Citi will conduct a search for Garg’s successor as the CEO of its commercial bank. Citigroup has asked Zdenek Turek, who was the Chief Risk Officer on an interim basis, to take on the role permanently, according to the memo. Fraser also named Margo Pilic as her chief of staff, moving her from her current role of Finance Lead for Citi’s institutional clients group in Latin America. Last year, Citi named current president Jane Fraser as its next chief executive making her the first woman to lead a major Wall Street bank.

11.280477025859154," Big U.S. banks hunger for loans, capital relief as deposits pile up (Reuters) - A swell of deposits during the coronavirus pandemic has put big U.S. banks on the back foot, with executives saying they hope regulators provide relief on rules that punish bloated balance sheets until loan demand snaps back. JPMorgan Chase & Co, Bank of America Corp and Citigroup took in more than $1 trillion in deposits last year, compared with a $92 billion increase in 2019. In a more normal economy, that kind of boost would be great, allowing banks to lend more or simply invest the money in short-term, low-risk securities, like Treasury bonds. But the stimulus payments and easy-money policies by the government that led to the inundation of deposits has also created a few problems for the banks: low interest rates that crimp lending profitability and stunted loan demand as customers and companies awash with cash spend less. Combined with rules that require more capital for bigger balance sheets, that makes deposits more expensive to hold, instead of profitable. “Excess liquidity is piling up,” Bank of America Chief Financial Officer Paul Donofrio said during a conference call on Tuesday after the bank reported record deposit growth. Profit margins on new deposits are “practically zero,” JPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Piepszak said last week. Citigroup’s $210 billion deposit increase pushed it into a new bracket under Fed rules, requiring the bank to hold more capital, the bank said last week. Big banks will not shun deposits due to the dynamic, executives said, because doing so could hurt their franchises. However, they did push regulators to extend capital relief programs that expire March 31. Banks also want adjustments for holdings that are not high risk, like U.S. Treasury securities. “It is an issue for us in the near to medium term should we not get the extension,” Piepszak said."
13.900578374590413," Gloomy outlook hits Citi shares despite quarterly profit beat (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc reported quarterly profit that beat market expectations on Friday, but a downbeat revenue and expense outlook showed it will take more than a year for the emerging economic recovery to trickle through to the bank’s bottom line. Bets on an economic recovery hinged on coronavirus vaccine roll outs and massive fiscal stimulus allowed Citi to release $1.5 billion from its reserves that it had previously set aside for sour loans, boosting results. Finance chief Mark Mason warned that the revenue the bank earns from lending activities could fall more than 4% this year as the bank contends with the rock-bottom interest rates monetary authorities are holding in place to prop up the economy. Citi’s revenue slid 10% in the last quarter of 2020, driven by declines in its consumer bank as customers borrowed less and paid down more debt. Fees in the North American branded cards business, once the growth engine of the consumer bank, tumbled 13%. Trading remained a bright spot defying concerns that the breakneck growth in trading revenue seen throughout 2020 was unsustainable. Equities fees jumped 57% from last year and fixed-income fees grew 7%, but the bump was not enough to offset interest-related revenue declines during the quarter. Citi shares fell 5.4% to $65.32 as the bank reported a 7% decline in profit even as its peers JPMorgan and Wells Fargo & Co posted growth in the fourth quarter. Expenses rose 2% as the bank spent more to address its risk and controls after being sanctioned by regulators last year for failing to address years long deficiencies. Citi’s finance head Mark Mason also said the bank’s expenses would rise again in 2021 in the range of 2% to 3% this year, further pressuring its operating margins. Incoming CEO Jane Fraser, who will officially take over next month, told analysts on a call that she was “determined” to address the deficiencies in its risk and control environment that have been raised by regulators and encouraging analysts skeptical that things would be different under her tenure to hold her accountable. In all, the bank profit of $4.63 billion, or $2.08 a share, down from $5 billion, or $2.15 a share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected profit of $1.34 per share, according to Refinitiv data Total loans fell 3% to $676 billion, while deposits rose 20% to $1.3 trillion as customers, faced with economic uncertainties, borrowed less and saved more. Outgoing CEO Michael Corbat said the bank intended to resume share buybacks in the first quarter, after receiving a green light from regulators last month. It has a capacity to buyback shares worth $1.8 billion in the first quarter, Mason said."

23.774186233879778," Citigroup urges return of mistaken Revlon payment as trial ends NEW YORK (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc made a final push on Wednesday to persuade a federal judge to force lenders of Revlon Inc to return half a billion dollars of its own money that it mistakenly sent them. At the conclusion of a six-day non-jury trial, U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman in Manhattan said he would rule as quickly as he could, while admitting “it’s not the easiest case.” The case stemmed from an Aug. 11 blunder where Citigroup, acting as Revlon’s loan agent, wired $893 million to Revlon lenders, which the struggling cosmetics company controlled by billionaire Ronald Perelman did not owe until 2023, rather than a $7.8 million interest payment. Ten asset managers including Brigade Capital Management, HPS Investment Partners and Symphony Asset Management have refused to return $501 million. Furman said he plans to consider their thinking immediately after being paid, as he decides whether there was a “discharge for value.” Such a discharge allows creditors who are owed money to keep sums they are mistakenly wired if they are unaware of a mistake. “You might expect some sort of chat or email like, ‘Whoa, can you believe it, they must have totally messed up,’” Furman said. Citigroup, the administrative agent for the 2016 loan, blamed human error for the overpayment. It said the lenders should return its money because they knew it was sent in error and Revlon couldn’t afford it. “The question is, what would have a reasonable person done under the circumstances,” Citigroup’s lawyer Christopher Houpt said. Revlon’s lenders acted “as if there was no repayment,” he said. In contrast, the defendants said they had no reason to believe Citigroup blundered. “The situation here is the exact payout of outstanding principal with accrued interest through that date,” their lawyer Adam Abensohn said. “That is quite different from hitting ‘send’ twice on the same interest payment.” Furman urged the financial services industry and regulators to adopt procedures to address similar situations. “The industry should figure out a better way of dealing with these things, even if this is a black swan event,” he said.

In the country’s biggest white collar criminal case, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) has brought charges against the financial giants, their client and current and former executives, accusing them of colluding to avoid flooding the market with new shares and stop the price falling. The matter has crawled through numerous hearings in a local court in Sydney as lawyers for each defendant sought to cross-examine prosecution witnesses and question whether regulators followed due process as they gathered evidence.

A trial date has not yet been set. ACCC chair Rod Sims declined to comment since the matter was before the court. Citi denied the allegations, as it has done throughout, while Deutsche Bank said it would defend the charges. ANZ, Australia’s fourth-largest retail bank, declined to comment. The case is being closely watched by financial markets participants around the world because it could influence how capital raisings are conducted. For companies, each criminal cartel charge could mean a fine of up to A$10 million or three times the amount the company benefited from the actions in question, whichever is greater.

U.S. District Judge Jesse Furman in Manhattan had late Wednesday said he could not be sure all the defendants were citizens of different states than the bank’s South Dakota-based Citibank unit, a jurisdictional requirement for the planned Dec. 9 nonjury trial. But at a hearing, lawyers for Citigroup and the defendants said they were making substantial progress on that issue, and confident at least most defendants could stay in the case. “I’m relieved in that it seems like it won’t blow up the trial on this issue,” Furman said. The lawsuit stemmed from Citigroup’s having on Aug. 11 sent $893 million of its own money, rather than a $7.8 million interest payment, to Revlon’s lenders. Citigroup was acting as the loan agent for the struggling cosmetics company, which lacked sufficient cash to fully repay the loan, which was due in 2023. The bank blamed human error for the blunder, and said the defendants knew the payment was a mistake but have nonetheless refused to return $508 million. It said about 200 lenders have returned the remaining $385 million. But the defendants, including Brigade Capital Management and HPS Investment Partners, said they were not obligated to return money Revlon owed, and had no reason to believe a global bank such as Citigroup would transfer the full amount by accident.

The third-largest U.S. bank has dismissed all charges against Investcorp Credit Management LLC, which it said had received $18.9 million from Citi’s accidental payment. “We are pleased to have these funds returned,” said Citigroup in a statement. Citi had sued a dozen firms for refusing to return the payment after an “operational error” caused the bank to transfer $900 million of its own funds to Revlon creditors, a blunder that led to costly litigation, regulatory consent orders and a $400-million penalty. Since then, Citi has announced that Chief Executive Mike Corbat would retire earlier than expected, with current president Jane Fraser set to succeed him."
62.364139359024186," Citigroup's Corbat faces tense analyst questions as he approaches exit (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc’s outgoing chief executive came under fire on Tuesday for mistakes that have led to regulatory penalties during a conference call to discuss quarterly results, with analysts questioning his pay and why he is not leaving immediately. In unusually direct exchanges, analysts pressed Chief Executive Mike Corbat to explain what management is doing to fix technical and operational problems that have plagued Citigroup for years and led the bank to erroneously send $900 million of its own funds to Revlon creditors in August. That blunder led to costly litigation between Citigroup and the recipients, as well as regulatory consent orders, a $400-million penalty and lots of embarrassment. Last month, Citigroup announced that Corbat would retire earlier than expected, to be replaced in February by Jane Fraser. Several analysts asked why Corbat did not make more progress in overhauling creaky technology or generating better returns for shareholders during his tenure. They also criticized what they described as a lack of accountability, noting that executive compensation should be better tied to risk management and shareholder returns. “Where is the sense of urgency?” Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo asked Corbat. “Why not step aside now?” Corbat described steps Citigroup is taking to repair issues identified by the Federal Reserve and Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and defended the progress Citigroup has made since he took charge. When asked how much the overhaul might ultimately cost, Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason said it would be “hard to pinpoint a number” beyond the $1 billion Citigroup is spending this year. Citigroup shares fell 5% to $43.58 in afternoon trading. Earlier in the day, Citigroup detailed a 34% decline in third-quarter profit as the coronavirus recession hurt its consumer bank. Its net income of $3.2 billion, or $1.40 per share, still topped analyst expectations of 93 cents per share. But the results were weaker than crosstown rival JPMorgan Chase & Co, whose quarterly profit rose, and Citigroup’s management offered a bleaker outlook. “We are expecting a somewhat more muted and slower recovery in both unemployment and GDP through 2022,” Mason said. Citigroup added about $314 million to credit loss reserves in the quarter, compared to the $15 billion it had set aside in the first half of the year. Revenue in North American branded cards, the growth engine for Citi’s consumer bank going into the year, fell 12% as its credit card customers closed accounts and spent less. The bank, one of the largest credit card issuers globally, said end-of-period open accounts across its portfolio dropped by 4%, or more than 5 million, and purchase sales slid 10%. Citi’s trading business was a bright spot, with a 16% jump in revenue helping to offset consumer weakness. Fraser, who was not on the call, has said that overhauling risk management and internal controls will be her priority. Analysts will probably get a chance to engage with her on the next quarterly call, Corbat said. Regulators have curtailed Citigroup’s ability to make significant acquisitions until its operational issues are fixed. Similar problems caused Citigroup to fail or barely pass its annual stress tests in prior years. Shareholders are concerned that the consent orders and $400 million fine are only the beginning of regulatory fallout for Citigroup, said Bank of America analyst Erika Najarian. She likened the situation to scandal-plagued Wells Fargo & Co , which has faced a long series of fines, lawsuits and regulatory penalties since its phony-accounts scandal began unraveling in 2016. Corbat said the two situations were not comparable because, unlike Wells Fargo, Citigroup did not dupe customers or seek to profit from the Revlon error. Instead, it lost money. “No fraud, no customer harm, no benefit around that,” he said."

47.987865831681816," ValueAct's Morfit says Citigroup positioned for growth, sees higher share price BOSTON (Reuters) - ValueAct Capital Management, a long-time investor in Citigroup Inc, threw its weight behind the third largest U.S. bank in an unusually public way on Thursday by saying its share price could double in the near term. “The upside is very compelling,” Mason Morfit, chief executive officer and chief investment officer of the $12 billion investment firm said at the 13D Monitor Investor Summit on Thursday. He said the bank is inexpensive now and well positioned for growth. Citigroup stock has languished compared to its peers as the bank struggled for years to convince Wall Street that it could reliably hit its financial targets. Shares have fallen 44% so far this year while the KBW Bank index has fallen 30%. Morfit spoke one day after U.S. banking regulators fined Citi $400 million and ordered it to repair its risk-management systems. The government’s rebuke was largely seen to have accelerated Citi CEO Michael Corbat’s decision to retire early next year and hand the reins to Citi President Jane Fraser. Morfit supported Fraser’s appointment and said the firm, which has owned Citi shares since early 2018, was looking forward to working with her. Citi’s institutional clients group is a star business, Morfit said, saying that it alone is worth at least $70 to $110 per share, which is double what the stock is trading today. He forecast this part of the business can continue to grow earnings per share over the next decade. Citi’s stock price, currently trading at $44.91, could jump to $80 in the near term and rise more to hit $150 over time, he said. Morfit called Citi an “irreplicable platform” and said it is well positioned for long-term growth because it is stable, safe and steadily taking share. As its core platform “chugs along,” Morfit said the payoff will come as the company’s return on tangible common equity can reach 15% to 16%. ValueAct, which recently saw founder Jeff Ubben depart, is an activist investor that likes to work behind the scenes over years by advising senior management instead of waging noisy proxy fights. “We try to transform companies from underachievers to overachievers,” Morfit said, adding that ValueAct has in the past lost money on bets before they pay off big."

42.9234086314336," U.S. Fed to extend curbs on big bank buy backs, dividends through end of year WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve will curb big bank capital distributions through the end of the year, meaning the likes of JPMorgan Chase & CoJPN., Citigroup Inc.C.N, Wells Fargo & CoWFC.N and Bank of America Corp.BAC.Nwill be barred from share buy backs and will have to cap dividends. The central bank announced it would extend its existing policy of limiting capital payouts for banks with at least $100 billion in assets, to ensure lenders have enough capital to weather the economic strain caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The restrictions, which apply to 34 banks, including the U.S. operations of several large foreign firms, were extended “due to the continued economic uncertainty from the coronavirus response,” the Fed said. The Fed announced in June it was taking the unprecedented step of limiting bank payouts after finding lenders faced significant capital losses under a pandemic-informed stress test. Under the new policy, banks cannot pay higher dividends than they did in the second quarter, and payments cannot exceed a firm’s average net income over the last four quarters. Large banks will face a second pandemic Fed stress test later this year, with results to be announced by the end of 2020. The Fed found in its original stress test that lenders could endure as much as $700 billion in loan losses under a severe economic downturn caused by the outbreak. Banks were expected to stay afloat amid those losses, but several skirted close to violating minimum capital levels required by regulators, the Fed said at the time."
42.79562855877511," Citigroup is fined $4.5 million by U.S. CFTC for deleting subpoenaed audio recordings NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. regulator on Monday fined Citigroup Inc C.N $4.5 million for deleting millions of audio files, including recordings it had subpoenaed, after failing to fix a known design flaw in its audio preservation system. The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission said the Nov. 2018 deletion of 2.77 million audio files included recordings of traders subpoenaed in Dec. 2017 for a probe, which Citigroup had promised would be preserved. Citigroup was accused of not following up on an employee’s warning in 2014 that the configuration of its audio preservation system might create a “ticking time bomb effect” that could, and did, cause mass deletions of audio files. The civil fine was imposed against Citibank NA, Citigroup Energy Inc and Citigroup Global Markets Inc for the New York-based bank’s failure to maintain sufficient internal controls over its technology. Citigroup did not admit or deny wrongdoing. A spokeswoman said the bank was pleased to settle. According to the CFTC, the deleted recordings comprised 683,296 calls for 982 individual users, including recordings covered by its subpoena, and 2,087,789 recordings from speakerbox or “Hoot n’ Holler” lines. The case is the latest to highlight problems with technology systems at the third-largest U.S. bank by assets. Citigroup is battling separately in Manhattan federal court to recoup $900 million of its own money that it accidentally paid to lenders for the cosmetics company Revlon Inc REV.N. Some hedge funds that lent money to Revlon and received payments from Citigroup have balked at repaying the bank, which blamed the incident on a clerical error."

The Wall Street bank said the three-year initiative will include programs that would provide greater access to banking and credit in communities of color, increase investment in Black-owned businesses and expand homeownership among Black Americans. “We are in the midst of a national reckoning on race and words are not enough,” said Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason. “We need awareness, education, and action that drive results.” Mason is one of the industry’s most senior Black executives.

41.10826394701944," Societe Generale gears up for Lyxor asset management sale - sources NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Societe Generale SOGN.PA is gearing up to launch the sale of its asset management arm Lyxor as the French lender seeks to shore up its finances after two consecutive quarterly losses, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. France's third-biggest bank has hired Citigroup C.N to oversee the sale, which is expected to kick off in the fourth quarter, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity as the matter is confidential. Societe Generale and Citi declined to comment. Lyxor had about 132 billion euros ($156 billion) of assets under management at the end of June, with exchanged-traded funds (ETF) representing almost half of its operations. It ranks as Europe’s third largest ETF provider. The business could be valued at about $1 billion, one of the sources said, adding that interested parties have recently been contacted as the sale is about to kick off. It will be aimed at bidders in Europe and United States, including French asset manager Amundi AMUN.PA and German rival DWS DWSG.DE, one of sources said, while cautioning that no deal was certain. “It’s all been prepared and is ready to start, but the board has yet to sign it off,” the source said. The unit posted a 21.6% decline in revenue to 40 million euros in the second quarter due to challenging market conditions and the fallout from the coronavirus crisis. Societe Generale’s boss Frederic Oudea is trying to strengthen the bank’s capital ratio and may also explore strategic options for its UK wealth management unit, Kleinwort Hambros, another source said. As part of an asset disposal programme first launched in 2018, Societe Generale has parted ways with assets in Eastern Europe and last year agreed to sell its Nordics-based SG Finans division to Nordea Bank NDAFI.HE for 575 million euros.

34.81259741341688," JPMorgan cuts outlook for net interest income on lower rates NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N expects about $55 billion in net interest income for full-year 2020, down from an earlier estimate of $56 billion, Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Piepszak said on Tuesday. Piepszak, at a virtual conference hosted by Barclays, also said the current trend points to 2021 net interest income of about $13 billion per quarter. JPMorgan’s third-quarter trading revenue will be up about 20% from a year earlier, Piepszak said. Citigroup Inc C.N expects third-quarter markets revenue will be up by a ""low double-digit"" percentage from a year earlier, Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason said on Monday at the same conference. JPMorgan does not expect to add a meaningful amount to its loan loss reserves after making large provisions at the end of the first and second quarters, she said. Banks are earning less interest on loans while the Federal Reserve holds interest rates down to support the economy. Trading revenue at the biggest banks has been one of the few bright spots in their results since the coronavirus outbreak. Piepszak said the bank has reserved for worse loan losses than it would expect under its base case for the economy. “While things do look a little bit better than we thought they would, we’re still dealing with an enormous amount of uncertainty looking ahead,” she said. “We would have to have confidence in the outlook before we would release reserves,” she said. Piepszak added that slack loan demand is weighing on net interest income. Consumers are paying off more of their credit card charges and paying down home loans, she said. And, many businesses quickly paid back the money they had borrowed on revolving credit lines when the pandemic started. “Loan growth, I think it is fair to say, will be challenged,” Piepszak said."

The bank has planned $1 billion in incremental investments this year to shore up the bank’s infrastructure and improve risk management and compliance, Mason said at an investor conference. For the third quarter, the bank expects to continue adding to its reserves for loan losses in light of a weaker economic outlook due to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. However, the build is likely to be significantly lower than in the first half of the year when the bank set aside over $7 billion a quarter for potential losses. Overall, the bank forecasts quarterly revenue to decline in the high single digits compared to last year due to lower interest rates and a slowdown in investment banking and consumer activity.

16.9810916807891," Citigroup's next CEO has Herculean task: turning the bank around for real NEW YORK (Reuters) - When Jane Fraser takes the helm of Citigroup Inc C.N in February, she will have some big tasks ahead of her. Citigroup, the third-largest U.S. lender, has struggled for years to convince Wall Street that management’s vision of a global bank with a hodgepodge of profitable, if unrelated, businesses will work. Profit targets set years ago by CEO Mike Corbat proved hard to reach even after revisions and major cost cuts. And although Citigroup is a much different bank than the one that required a $45 billion bailout to survive the 2007-2009 financial crisis, it still carries a stigma from failures that led it there. Citigroup’s legal battles with hedge funds after mistakenly sending them $900 million of its own funds suggests that it has ongoing technology issues, analysts, investors and insiders said. Those problems have been a sticking point with regulators, which have pushed Citi to fix them in order to pass annual stress tests. Although Fraser’s promotion was celebrated on Thursday as a sign that women can get ahead on Wall Street, analysts and investors said the halo will last only as long as she can deliver results. “The job of this woman is to get new business, solve the problem with the government on the technology - and get new business,” said Dick Bove, a longtime bank analyst with Odeon Capital Group. “That’s her job, and I think if anybody can do it, she can.” Bove and others put Fraser’s challenges into three buckets: growing revenue, addressing costly operational issues and truly repairing Citi’s brand, which has been tarnished for over a decade. Fraser, 53, has a reputation as a “fix-it” executive, and many expressed faith in her abilities. A former Goldman Sachs investment banker and McKinsey consultant, Fraser cleaned up Citigroup’s toxic mortgage book after the financial crisis, then its Latin America business after scandals erupted in Mexico, and has been leading its global consumer bank - which Citi is trying to grow - since October. Although Fraser had been seen as a front-runner to succeed Corbat for awhile, many analysts found the change to be abrupt. Most expected a longer-term transition that might take a year or two, with some questioning why Citigroup made the announcement on a seemingly random Thursday in September. Some investors had hoped Citigroup would appoint an outsider with a fresh perspective as its next CEO, KBW analyst Brian Kleinhanzl said in a note predicting an underwhelming share reaction to the news. Citigroup shares fell 0.9% on Thursday, compared with a 1.8% decline in the S&P 500 index. The 43% total return shareholders have gotten since the beginning of Corbat's tenure in 2012 through Wednesday's close pales in comparison to the 137% return for JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N shares and 169% for Bank of America Corp BAC.N shares during the same time frame, according to Refinitiv data. Out of the top six U.S. Wall Street banks, Citigroup's total return is higher only than that of Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N, which has been plagued by various scandals since 2016. A Citigroup executive who spoke to Reuters said staffers were happy with Fraser’s appointment. The person, who was not authorized to speak to the press, said she is seen as someone who understands Citigroup’s key businesses and can repair ties with investors and the government. The person noted Fraser’s success with regulators who scrutinized Citigroup’s woes in Mexico, which ranged from bad underwriting in mortgages to oil loans that were later found to be fraudulent. One major investor said Fraser may be the CEO who can turn Citigroup around. The person described her as someone who has shown she can cut costs and invest in businesses appropriately, and comes across as truly caring about Citigroup’s welfare. But it will not be a cakewalk for Fraser to get the bank to perform in line with peers again. “She will start in ‘prove-it’ mode,” the person said, “and there is a lot to prove.”"
16.9810916807891," Citigroup's Fraser to be first woman CEO of Wall Street bank (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc named consumer banking head Jane Fraser as its next chief executive on Thursday, making her the first woman to lead a major Wall Street bank. Fraser, 53, has been a rising star in the financial industry, with a career that spans investment banking, wealth management, troubled mortgage workouts and strategy in Latin America – a key geography for Citigroup. She will take the reins from CEO Michael Corbat in February, the bank said. Fraser’s promotion to CEO was celebrated as a step in the right direction for an industry that has few women or diverse executives in its top ranks. “Great news for the company and for women everywhere!” tweeted Bank of America Corp operations and technology chief Cathy Bessant. “A big and fantastic moment.” In an internal memo, Corbat characterized Fraser’s new role as a groundbreaking event and a point of pride for Citigroup. Fraser has spoken publicly about the struggles she faced as a young woman, and then a working mother, in a competitive industry. At 2016 event hosted by an international business group, she described her early days as an investment banker, when women were expected to act and dress like men to succeed, as well as her experience juggling home life and work. “I’m often asked, ‘Can you have it all? Can you do it all?’” she said at a 2016 event hosted by an international business society. “And I say, ‘Yes, you can, but you can’t do it all at once and don’t expect everything at once.” Fraser joins a small group of women who have broken through the glass ceiling to reach the C-suite at major financial firms. In addition to Bessant, there is Fidelity Investments CEO Abigail Johnson; JPMorgan’s consumer lending head Marianne Lake and its finance chief Jennifer Piepszak; and Alison Rose, CEO of British bank NatWest. Only 37 of companies on this year’s Fortune 500 list are led by women. Fraser launched her career in Goldman Sachs Group Inc’s mergers & acquisitions department in London, then worked for Asesores Bursátiles in Madrid. She joined Citigroup 16 years ago and is credited internally with helping the bank recover after the financial crisis, when it had to take $45 billion in taxpayer funds to survive. Through the years, she has run client strategy in Citi’s investment bank, as well as its private bank, its mortgage business and its operations in Latin America, which accounted for 14% of annual revenue in 2019. Her name was floated as a potential CEO candidate at Wells Fargo & Co last year, before the board settled on former JPMorgan executive Charles Scharf. In October, Fraser was promoted to the role of president and tasked to head its global consumer bank, a move that was widely seen as a precursor to her elevation. Dylan Haggart, a partner at ValueAct Capital, which owns 27 million shares of Citigroup, said that the hedge fund had worked closely with Fraser in recent years and developed a “deep appreciation for her ability to lead thoughtful strategic transformation and drive operational results.” Credit Suisse analyst Susan Roth Katzke said the promotion came sooner than expected, and that investors are eager to get an audience with her. “Investors will need to hear more from Jane, sooner rather than later,” she said. Corbat, who has spent 37 years at Citigroup, was launched into the CEO role in 2012, when his predecessor suddenly left under pressure from investors. Since then, he has shifted Citigroup’s strategy to focus on corporate businesses where it has strengths, like fixed-income trading and cash management, as well as credit cards and digital consumer banking. He also wound down a huge book of troubled assets known as Citi Holdings, effectively transforming the bank from a bailed out, money-losing entity with operations spanning the world into a slimmer, more profitable version with targeted global operations. Citigroup’s annual profits have more than doubled under Corbat, but rival banks have done better. Only recently has Citigroup been able to meet performance targets that Corbat set and tweaked through the years. Its shares have risen 43% during his tenure, vs 63% to 188% for Wall Street peers."

11.470494031771436," Citi receives China fund custody licence HONG KONG (Reuters) - A Citigroup China unit has received a domestic fund custody licence from the China Securities Regulatory Commission, the bank said on Wednesday, the latest foreign financial firm to expand its presence in mainland China. Citi is the first U.S. bank to receive such a licence, which will allow it to hold securities for safekeeping on behalf of mutual funds and private funds domiciled in China, once it has passed an onsite inspection. Despite Sino-U.S. political tensions, several U.S. asset managers are expanding their presence in China, after foreign ownership restrictions were scrapped earlier this year. BlackRock last week became the first global asset manager to win regulatory approval to set up a mutual fund unit in China, and Vanguard Group announced it would shift its Asian headquarters to Shanghai and close its Hong Kong and Japan operations. “As international fund managers, securities firms, and insurance companies set up in China, we believe they will want a trusted service provider to help them mitigate risks and reduce costs,” David Russell, Citi’s APAC Head of Securities Services, said in a statement."

Based in Paris, Rousseau will focus on the bank’s French client franchise while also providing financial advisory across the region. A 26-year industry veteran, Rousseau was Deutsche Bank's former M&A boss for EMEA and also worked at Morgan Stanley MS.N and Goldman Sachs GS.N. In his new role, he will seek to enhance Citi’s strategic client coverage and help companies identify opportunities despite a difficult backdrop, with French M&A down 40% this year due to the coronavirus crisis. Rousseau will report to Philip Drury who runs Citi’s banking, capital markets and advisory business across EMEA. His appointment comes after the recent departure of Maja Torun, who was Citi's co-head of France investment banking and left in April to take on a similar job at JPMorgan JPM.N."
11.843532547436158," Australia court rejects request to delay epic cartel case against Citi, Deutsche SYDNEY (Reuters) - An Australian court overseeing a criminal cartel case against Citigroup Inc C.N and Deutsche Bank AG DBKGn.DE on Tuesday declined a prosecution request to delay proceedings, raising the chances the long-running matter will proceed to trial this year. In the country's biggest white collar criminal case, a regulator has accused the investment banks of colluding over a A$2.5 billion ($1.8 billion) 2015 share issue to withhold unsold shares and keep the stock from falling. Their client, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd ANZ.AX, is also defending the case. But the matter, which has nine defendants including the financial giants and their staff and former staff, has been crawling through the lower court in Sydney since the charges were laid in mid-2018 as defence lawyers question prosecution witnesses to determine the parameters of the complex case. The ruling that the parties must begin a case management hearing on Nov. 24, not Dec. 15 as requested by the prosecution, gives the matter a chance of moving to the Federal Court, where a trial would take place, before the end of the year. “We’ve reached the point where I have to say enough’s enough,” Magistrate Jennifer Atkinson told the Downing Centre Local Court in a short administrative hearing. “It’s not fair to people to leave it too much longer. It needs to leave this court,” she added. Prosecution lawyer Shanaka Jayasuriya told the court the later date would help all parties involved because “the reality is that organising nine separate case conferences is a challenge (and) some of the clients are located overseas”. The matter is being closely watched by financial markets participants around the world because it could influence how capital raisings are conducted. None of the defendants has entered a formal plea but all have said they will plead not guilty to the charges which potentially carry prison terms."

The third largest U.S. bank has so far sued a dozen firms after an “operational error” that caused it to transfer $900 million of its own funds to Revlon creditors one day after the troubled cosmetics company was sued over its restructuring tactics. Several hundred million has already been returned the bank, Citi said in an emailed statement. But it has had to take legal action to recover over $500 million from lenders who are refusing to return the payment. “All of the funds owed to Citi have now either been returned or frozen by court order,” the bank said in the statement. “We believe the law is on our side and that we will recover the outstanding funds.”"

2.667254049695541," Citigroup wins freeze on funds mistakenly sent to Revlon creditors (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc C.N won a small victory on Tuesday in its battle to recoup nearly $900 million it mistakenly sent to creditors of troubled cosmetics company Revlon Inc REV.N. A U.S. judge blocked a hedge fund from doing anything with its nearly $175 million portion of the payout while he considers a preliminary injunction that could eventually require the firm to repay Citigroup. In a large blunder, Citigroup last week erroneously repaid a nearly $900 million loan made to Revlon, a day after lenders sued the cosmetic company over its restructuring tactics. Citi quickly caught the payment error and was taking steps to recover the funds, the bank has said. Citi had been acting as agent on the loan, meaning it collected payments from Revlon to distribute to the creditors, but the accidental payment came from the bank’s own funds. The error has drawn scrutiny from regulators who have begun looking into the loan and raised questions about the bank’s operational resiliency. The regulatory fallout of the mistake is likely to be drawn out, long time banking analyst Dick Bove from Odeon Capital Group said in a research note. “A payment error by the nation’s only truly international bank is likely to cause significant questions concerning the systems the bank is using,” he said. Brigade Capital Management LP, which got $175 million from the payment, has so far refused to give the money back. Citigroup wired the money to 43 Brigade funds because they were Revlon’s lenders, rather than Brigade itself. “To target Brigade as if they were the lender here, it just doesn’t work and it doesn’t make sense with respect to the type of relief they’re seeking,” said Robert Loigman, a lawyer representing Brigade. An attorney for Citigroup asserted that as manager of the funds, Brigade has the power to return the money to the bank, and that if a judge rules the hedge fund can keep the funds it would create dangerous precedent. “We think it creates serious issues for the banking industry If players like Brigade can understand, by all accounts, that this was unintentional, that this was a mistake, and can reap a windfall from it,” said Matthew Ingber, who represents Citi."

Citigroup repaid a nearly $900 million loan made to Covid-battered cosmetics outfit Revlon on Thursday, a day after lenders sued the company over its restructuring tactics, the Wall Street Journal reported. Unfortunately for investors, the repayment was an error, and Citi quickly asked for the money back. It’s an embarrassing mistake for the former agent for the 2016 loan, named in Wednesday’s lawsuit spearheaded by UMB Bank, the current agent. And the timing couldn’t have been worse, with creditors fresh from alleging Revlon shifted intellectual property – collateral they thought was theirs – to subsidiaries outside their reach, accusations the company said were baseless. If it turns out Citi’s fat-finger error had anything to do with the disruption of remote working, that’s another coronavirus-related risk for employers to examine. For a bank, keeping the money in the right place is, well, foundational. (By Richard Beales) COMMUNITY SPREAD. WeWork is doing surprisingly well. It’s a good thing it never went public. The shared-office provider said on Thursday revenue in the second quarter was $882 million, an increase of 9% compared with last year, and it had slashed its cash burn rate, according to Reuters. Though the number of its members declined 12% from the previous quarter to 612,000, the remaining ones are of the more valuable sort – from businesses with 500 employees or more. That’s even though Covid-19 has made offices and the companies that own them an afterthought. WeWork’s results suggest people haven’t been ditching their homes away from home too quickly. Yet shares in WeWork’s closest competitor IWG, which owns similar business Regus, are off a third from last year. Real estate investment trust SL Green Realty’s shares are down a similar amount. That suggests the future outlook for shared offices – or offices in general – is grim. WeWork’s investor community may be thankful they aren’t facing that music in public.

The company’s $16 billion video-streaming arm iQiyi, has revealed it is under investigation by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over its financial and operating records. That, and a disappointing revenue forecast for the third quarter from Baidu, sent shares of the $43 billion parent and iQiyi down 7% and 12% respectively during after-hours trading in New York. The probe into Baidu’s crown jewel adds to entrenched problems. Boss Robin Li’s other diversification efforts into artificial intelligence and cloud computing have been slow. Meanwhile, hungry rivals like ByteDance are churning out popular apps which are taking crucial advertising dollars out of Baidu’s pocket. Li is running out of time to get his company in shape.

The 9 billion euro German container shipping firm said on Friday that net profit nearly doubled in the first half of the year to 285 million euros even though revenue and shipping volumes declined because of lockdown-related trade disruptions. True, fuel costs were 17% lower in the second quarter than a year earlier, but they were 4% higher over the whole of the first half. Chief Executive Rolf Habben Jansen attributed the improved profitability to his “Performance Safeguarding Programme”. He didn’t have to wait for a global pandemic to start running a tighter ship but at least he has made a start. Hapag-Lloyd shares nearly trebled in May for reasons that remain unclear, including to its management, before promptly collapsing. Friday’s 9% gains appear to be built on firmer foundations. (By Ed Cropley) LABOUR PANGS. The Dutch unemployment rate jumped to 3.8% in the second quarter from 3% at the end of the first, official data showed on Friday. That’s quite different from Britain, where the jobless rate stayed steady at 3.9% in the three months to the June, or France, where it fell to a 37-year low in the second quarter as lockdowns made it difficult for people to look for work. Why the difference? It’s not that the Dutch economy is especially weak. After all, Dutch GDP shrank by a relatively modest 8.5% in the second quarter compared with the first. The UK’s reported decline was more than twice as large. Look rather to the use of flexible contracts in the Netherlands. The drop in employment in the second quarter mainly affected those working under these arrangements, ING economists point out. As more non-working but still employed people in other European countries lose their jobs, other unemployment rates are likely to follow the Dutch lead. (By Swaha Pattanaik)"
-7.856355849523034," Ex-Citi London forex trader welcomes unfair dismissal ruling (Reuters) - A former top currency trader has won an unfair dismissal case against Citigroup Inc but cannot expect to return to his job, a London employment tribunal has ruled. Rohan Ramchandani, the former European head of Citigroup’s forex spot market trading desk, alleged in a lawsuit in October that the bank had dismissed him unfairly without due process or warning. Ramchandani was seeking reinstatement, which would have made him eligible to receive back pay and any other awards. However, employment judge Alison Russell said giving him his job back was not practicable as Citi had proved in the London tribunal that he had been dismissed due to his conduct, although the bank had failed to follow fair procedure. Citi said in an emailed statement that it had already acknowledged that Ramchandani’s dismissal did not follow its usual policy and was unsurprised by that aspect of the ruling. It said it welcomed the tribunal’s decision not to order his return to Citi employment. Tribunal compensation for unfair dismissal is capped in Britain at 88,519 pounds, a fraction of the salary Ramchandani earned at Citi, but the exact amount due to the former trader was not disclosed. “I am pleased that the tribunal has not only found that I was unfairly dismissed but that Citi acted unreasonably and so has awarded me the maximum uplift for such conduct,” Ramchandani said in an email sent to Reuters. “The tribunal also accepted my genuine belief that my chats were not improper.” Ramchandani is suing Citigroup for damages of $112 million in a separate lawsuit filed at the Southern District of New York, alleging that the bank made materially false and malicious statements to U.S. prosecutors that led to charges of foreign exchange rigging against him. A date for the lawsuit brought by Ramchandani has yet to be fixed. ($1 = 0.7650 pounds)"

Investigators wrote a statement which appeared to show a rival banker’s concern about “inappropriate” co-ordination between the companies while they were working on a stock issue, then interviewed the witness and the passages re-appeared the witness’s final signed statement, the court heard. The disclosure shows another strand of the defence against Australia’s biggest white collar criminal lawsuit: lawyers for the investment banks have been trying to show investigators departed from due process to build a case against them. The banks and their former staffers are charged with colluding during a A$2.5 billion ($1.8 billion) 2015 stock issue to withhold unsold shares and keep the stock from falling. Their client, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd ANZ.AX, is also defending the case. The matter is being closely watched by financial market participants around the world because it could influence how capital raisings are conducted. Leah Won, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's general manager of financial services competition, was asked about a draft witness statement the regulator wrote for an employee of JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, which also worked on the share issue but cooperated with prosecutors for immunity. “You hadn’t spoken to (JPMorgan’s then head of equities Mark) Leung at the time?” ANZ’s lawyer, Simon Buchen, asked Won. “No, I don’t think that we had,” Won replied. “Before you had spoken to Mr Leung, you or one of your investigators was pre-populating the statement with his concerns,” Buchen said. “It’s a fundamental aspect of a criminal investigation that an investigator has to have an open mind, correct?” “Yes,” Won said. All pre-written parts of Leung’s statement “assist the prosecution in one way or another”, said Buchen. “Can you accept that?” “I think that’s probably right,” Won replied. “That doesn’t evidence an open state of mind (about) what he was thinking at the time, does it?” “These were propositions ... that were put to him. I’m not sure that is inconsistent with an open state of mind.” JPMorgan and the ACCC have declined to comment outside the court proceedings. The hearing continues."

Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) enforcement director Michael Taylor should not have sent draft witness statements to his personal email account and saved sensitive documents on USB sticks so he could work on the investigation at home, said Leah Won, a senior staffer at the regulator. The disclosure in a pre-trial hearing underscores a key line of defence against the country’s biggest white collar criminal case: the investment banks want to show the evidence used to charge them was tainted by departure from due process.

Under questioning from a lawyer for Deutsche Bank, Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) senior official Jane Lin told a pre-trial hearing in Sydney she did not know why the material was deleted. Lin was shown a JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N draft witness statement which included suggestions the banks were concerned about disrupting an orderly market if they dumped their unsold shares simultaneously. The final signed statement excluded the remarks. “The ACCC has excised parts of his draft which demonstrate an intention ... to do the right thing by the market,” Deutsche Bank lawyer Marugan Thangaraj said. “I have to agree ... that it’s not in the final statement,” Lin replied. Asked why the ACCC cut references to “exculpatory matters going to elements of the offence”, Lin said: “Either someone else is better placed to give that evidence, a contemporaneous document (might give it, or) it wasn’t in the right format in regards to admissibility. There are a whole range of iterations.” The ACCC alleges the three investment banks engaged in criminal cartel behaviour in a A$2.5 billion ($1.8 billion) share issue for Australia and New Zealand Banking Group ANZ.AX in 2015. The banks say they acted independently. The case is being closely watched by financial players around the world because it could influence the way share issues are run.

-13.328484897382257," Citigroup quarterly profit tumbles 73% as loan loss provisions surge July 14 (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc reported a nearly 73% plunge in quarterly profit on Tuesday as the bank set aside $5.6 billion to brace itself for a potential surge in loan defaults stemming from the coronavirus outbreak. The New York-based bank reported a profit of $1.32 billion, or 50 cents per share, for the second quarter ended June 30, down from $4.8 billion, or $1.95 per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 5% to $19.77 billion. Analysts on average had forecast $19.12 billion in revenue and earnings of 28 cents per share, according to Refinitiv data. It was not immediately clear whether estimates were comparable with the figures reported by the bank. The largest U.S. lenders have so far stashed away more than $52 billion to prepare for potential losses this year after government ordered shutdowns triggered historic unemployment and a slowdown in spending. As the third largest credit card issuer in the United States, Citi is especially susceptible to any jump in credit card delinquencies, which tend to track rises in unemployment closely. So far, Citi has offered forbearance on 2 million credit card accounts representing 6% of balances, the bank said. While the pandemic has caused banks to reevaluate their loan books, it has been a boon for deposits. End of period deposits surged 18% to $1.23 trillion as stimulus programs left consumers and corporate clients with more cash to help them ride out the economic consequences of the pandemic. Total loans, however, fell marginally to $685 billion. Trading fees were again a bright spot for the bank as market volatility prompted more client activity, helping offset rock-bottom interest rates that make it harder for banks to earn money on lending. Fixed income jumped 68% from a year earlier, overshadowing a 3% decline in equities trading. (Reporting by C Nivedita and Imani Moise in New York; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)"
-13.681470489141242," Citi expects stocks to go sideways for a year, suggests defensives SINGAPORE (Reuters) - World stocks will probably tread water for a year, according to Citi C.N strategists, who recommend a more defensive portfolio in the face of the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic. Citi equity strategists are recommending clients play it safe by holding U.S. stocks and healthcare shares and reducing exposure to bank shares, as earnings are likely to take a while to recover from the coronavirus fallout. “The bullish push from $6 trillion of global quantitative easing is likely to cancel out the bearish drag from the ongoing lockdown,” the investment bank’s equity strategists said in a note published late on Sunday. Restrictive measures imposed to contain the virus has ravaged economic activity and hurt demand for risky assets in recent months, but their impact has been offset somewhat by huge asset buying from central banks, which has supported confidence. “We would not chase markets higher from current levels,” the strategists said. The note forecasts the S&P 500 .SPX to be at 3,160 points in mid-2021, about 1% higher than Friday's close. It expects other major markets from Australia .AXJO to Europe .STOXX and Japan .TOPX to be similarly steady. The outlook is broadly similar to that outlined by HSBC Private Banking last week, and a touch more downbeat than Credit Suisse which is slightly more positive on equities. Citi said financials will struggle with prolonged low interest rates, and are best avoided, in favour of defensives such as health care. Citi upgraded its recommendation for the materials sector to overweight and downgraded consumer staples."
-12.755394960544558," Citi targets more growth in Saudi Arabia after adding over 20 bankers in two years DUBAI (Reuters) - Citigroup C.N is planning to hire more bankers in Saudi Arabia for its direct custody business after adding more than 20 for onshore capital markets in the last two years, its Europe, Middle East and Africa head said. The bank, which following a 13-year hiatus returned to Saudi Arabia in 2018 after being granted a capital markets licence, said last year it would also expand its direct custody and clearing services to the oil-rich kingdom. David Livingstone told a conference on Thursday that while there was no set time-table for the lender to obtain a full banking licence in Saudi Arabia, the outlook for financial sector activity is positive. “That is something we want to participate very strongly in,” he said. “Recently we secured our direct custody and services licence and we will be growing that business.” The division provides services from trading execution to clearing to institutional investor clients. Citigroup was among the banks that advised Saudi Aramco 2222.SE on the oil giant's record $29.4 billion initial public offering last year and in April advised the Saudi government on a $7 billion three-tranche bond sale. Asked whether Citigroup is more cautious about lending to Middle East producers given lower oil prices, he said “on balance, no”. Brent crude LCOc1 is trading at around $42 a barrel, recovering from recent lows due to output cuts by oil producers, but is still down from over $60 a barrel at the start of the year, as the coronavirus pandemic crimped demand. Livingstone said the low cost base of many Middle Eastern producers gave them greater ability to withstand “lower for longer” oil prices than those in some other parts of the world."
-12.755394960544558," Citi commodity business hits record in first-quarter on volatile markets LONDON (Reuters) - Citigroup’s commodity business soared to record revenues in the first quarter, mainly due to sharp swings in prices such as oil during the COVID-19 pandemic, an executive said. Trading activity has levelled off recently, but there was still strong interest in structured deals, such as financing of base metals, Jose Cogolludo, global head of commodities, told a webinar. “We’ve seen a record level of client activity in the first quarter and that extended to April,” Cogolludo said, without providing figures. A spokeswoman confirmed he was referring to record commodity revenues in the first three months of the year. In April, Citigroup reported a 46% fall in quarterly profit, but that was partly cushioned by a surge in trading fees, with trading revenues in the fixed income division, which includes commodities, up 39%. Banks typically do not break out commodities revenues when reporting results. “That (increase) was predominantly driven by flow business on the investment side of the business, tactical accounts and asset managers that were of course responding to this unprecedented crisis and very unpredictable market outlook.” There was also a significant increase in corporate clients adding protective hedges, he added. Among commodities, oil prices have been the most volatile with WTI crude futures tumbling below $0 for the first time in history, sliding on April 20 to minus $37.63. Cogolludo said trading levels had retreated in recent months, but other types of activity were still healthy. “The flow business that was predominant in the first half of the year has normalised to more normal levels. But we’ve certainly seen an elevated interest in more structured and strategic transactions, for example, financing-related solutions specifically in industrial metals spaces,” he said. “We would expect in the second half of the year and well into next year that this would continue.”"

-14.781640885285121," Standard Life Aberdeen picks ex-Citi executive as CEO LONDON (Reuters) - Standard Life Aberdeen (SLA) SLA.L Chief Executive Keith Skeoch will step down after five years at the helm and former Citi executive Stephen Bird will replace him, the British asset manager said on Tuesday. The announcement marks the end of a 14-year career as an SLA director for Skeoch, during which he oversaw the 2017 merger of Standard Life and Aberdeen Asset Management to create one of Britain’s biggest fund managers. His period as CEO, a job he originally shared with former Aberdeen chief Martin Gilbert, has not always been smooth. Heavy underperformance in the year after the merger drew criticism from some investors, something Chairman Douglas Flint looked to respond to quickly after joining the company last year, ditching the co-CEO structure and ultimately paving the way for Gilbert to leave the firm. “With integration well progressed and having built significant balance sheet strength, this appointment launches the next phase of evolution aimed at developing and expanding the revenue opportunities available to SLA,” the company said. At 0912 GMT, SLA's shares were up 3.3% in a weaker FTSE 100 .FTSE. “I was a little surprised by this news,” said Darius McDermott, managing director at Chelsea Financial Services. “That said, they always described the integration of the two businesses as a 3-year journey and that is now at an end.” Bird will join the board as CEO-designate on July 1 and Skeoch will serve out the remainder of his contract, which runs until July 2021, as non-executive chairman of Aberdeen Standard Investments Research Institute. “The current crisis has highlighted the importance of active asset management as well as building greater resilience into personal financial planning,” Bird said. “SLA’s leading asset management, platforms and wealth capabilities give great scope to help clients and customers navigate these challenges; this is what attracted me to the company.” SLA said it expected the transition to take place by the end of the third quarter, subject to regulatory approval. Bird spent 21 years at Citigroup and most recently served as CEO of its Global Consumer Banking business from 2015 to November 2019. Prior to that, he was CEO for Citigroup’s Asia Pacific business, including India and China. “He is an inspiring leader with a great track record and experience in leading businesses to harness digital technology to improve both productivity and the client and customer experience,” said Flint."

-14.565798281962362," Slow UK recovery risks ballooning borrowing, IFS/Citi research shows LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s government will still be borrowing vast sums of money five years from now if the economy takes time to recover from the coronavirus fallout, new research published on Friday showed. The Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank and U.S. investment bank Citi said they thought it would take the economy “several years” to adjust to the pandemic, in contrast to scenarios from official forecasters showing a relatively swift rebound. That would point to a budget deficit of around 130 billion pounds ($162 billion) - or 5% of GDP - in five years’ time, more than double the forecast published by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) in March. Data due later on Friday are likely to show Britain is on course for a record increase in borrowing this financial year, to reach the highest level as a share of the economy since World War Two. “Even so, with current low interest rates, additional borrowing now that boosts the economic recovery would still be worthwhile,” IFS economist Isabel Stockton said. “But once we are through the immediate crisis and the economy reaches a new normal, we will be left with elevated debt.” Stockton added that a mix of tax rises and an acceptance that higher debt will need to be managed carefully seemed to be the most likely outcomes. Britain’s emergency spending and tax cuts to soften the economic hit from the coronavirus crisis are likely to cost 132.5 billion pounds, the OBR said earlier this month. It estimated new borrowing in the current financial year could approach 300 billion pounds as normal tax revenues dry up."

-7.8661414739017586," Breakingviews - Citi uncomfortably straddles Hong Kong-China fence HONG KONG (Reuters Breakingviews) - Citigroup has a busy time ahead staying out of Chinese politics. Chief Executive Mike Corbat has so far avoided taking sides on Beijing’s controversial security law targeting sedition, terrorism, and “foreign interference” in Hong Kong. But if the White House follows through on threats to sanction Chinese banks over the issue, the $124 billion lender might make a convenient target for retaliation. HSBC and Standard Chartered publicly backed the law last week; HSBC even published a photo of regional chief Peter Wong signing a supportive petition, although major shareholder Aviva Investors pointed out this is premature at best given the actual legal text hasn’t been published yet. American companies in Hong Kong, reticent so far, might feel pressure to follow suit. After all, in 2014 the big four U.S. accounting firms came out against the pro-democracy demonstrations snarling Hong Kong’s streets. Citi sticks out in the Asian financial hub, with its logo slapped on retail branches and ATMs, while most U.S. peers stick to the corporate side. It has won some high-profile business of late, helping Alibaba launch a secondary listing on the local exchange in late 2019 and advising trading house Li & Fung on its May take-private deal. Anti-Beijing sentiment could work in Citi’s favour if demonstrators migrate their HSBC accounts. So China might lean on Citi’s Asia Pacific boss Peter Babej to speak up, too. Were he to demur, mainland license applications might get put on hold, Citi could be locked out of Belt and Road projects, and its pipeline of Chinese initial public offerings could freeze. Were Babej to take Beijing’s side, however, it would not go down well in Washington. And Citi might get punished by China regardless, depending on the scope of U.S. sanctions against mainland lenders. Indeed on Tuesday state tabloid the Global Times dismissed Wong’s photo op and said HSBC is still on the hook for cooperating with a U.S. investigation into telecommunications giant Huawei. The pandemic left Citi more reliant on Asia, which in the first quarter comprised 53% of the bank’s profit. Fortunately its regional business is diversified, with markets like Vietnam driving growth, so any Chinese punishment will sting, not cripple. With little political room to manoeuvre, Corbat’s best hope lies in Beijing letting Citi stay on the fence."
-12.407599412032386," Citigroup closes some branches, mostly in LA and Chicago, due to George Floyd protests (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc C.N said on Friday it would ""proactively"" close some branches and reduce hours at others in light of protests around the country in response to the death of George Floyd that have at times turned violent. Some of Citi’s branches were damaged during recent demonstrations, head of U.S. consumer banking Anand Selva said in an email to customers. “We are actively working on repairs and assessing the situation carefully to re-open these branches,” he said. “Where necessary, we’re putting in place heightened security protocols, including proactively closing or reducing hours in some of our branches.” As of Friday morning, about 40 of Citigroup’s 700 branches were temporarily closed due to planned protest activity or previous damage, spokesman Drew Benson said. Most of the closures are in the Los Angeles and Chicago markets. Protests against police brutality and racial inequality have swept the United States over the last week, causing local governments to impose curfews in attempt to keep them from becoming violent. The unrest and threat of looting have caused many businesses to stay shut just as many were considering re-opening amid easing COVID-19 related restrictions around country. In March, Citigroup said it would temporarily shutter up to 15% of its U.S. branch network to help stem the spread of the novel coronavirus. The demonstrations have also prompted executives and companies to issue statements condemning racism. “These are extraordinarily difficult times,” Selva said. “My sincere hope is that we will all work together toward a better future.”"

For Chawla, who starts his new role at the end of July, the move marks the end of a long career at Citi, where his most recent job titles were co-head of global insurance investment banking and co-head of the financial institutions group in North America. Chawla’s title at Barclays will be vice chairman of the financial institutions group (FIG). He will be based in New York and report to Tim Main, global head of FIG banking, the statement added. The announcement of Chawla’s impending move comes amid a recent slew of movement involving senior investment bankers who cover the insurance sector. Citi announced May 18 it had hired Jawad Haider from Credit Suisse Group CSGN.S as the bank's new head of North America insurance investment banking.

In addition to shareholder defense, the group will leverage its data capabilities to serve a broader set of clients and offer insights into client’s asset bases, corporate finance structure and tax strategies, executives told Reuters. “Bringing these businesses closer together will help scale their respective impact and harness our intellectual capital more effectively,” the global heads of Citigroup’s Banking, Capital Markets and Advisory Group Tyler Dickson and Manolo Falcó said in a memo to staff. This year the number of campaigns launched by activists fell by 40% due to the coronavirus pandemic but companies remain concerned about potential proxy battles since activists have recently launched campaigns against larger companies such as AT&T. “Our shareholder advisory group has been helping clients look beyond the near-term to assess their potential vulnerabilities from a defense perspective, as well as consider opportunities for potential growth and M&A as the market slowly finds some stability,” Paterson said in a statement. Rivals such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N and JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N have also launched initiatives to fuse shareholder defense and data science in recent years.

4.587474650366068," Global remittances could fall by $100 billion in 2020, says Citi LONDON (Reuters) - Slower economic growth expectations prompted Citi on Monday to slash its forecasts for global remittances, saying this raised the risk to credit ratings of smaller emerging market countries and was set to push up their borrowing costs. Remittances could fall by $100 billion in the worse case scenario, Citi said in a note to clients, while more than doubling its base case for the scale of decline to $68 billion in 2020. In mid-April, it had estimated that the amount of wages migrants would send home would shrink by some $28 billion this year. This would cause the biggest problems for countries with little fiscal space to mitigate the hit from falling remittances, which would increasingly force them to spend larger amounts to prop up their economies. That raises the risk that they become unable to meet all their debt obligations. “Declines in remittances may have negative implications for the sovereign debt ratings of small EMs (emerging markets),” Citi’s Dana Peterson wrote in a note to clients. “Tajikistan and Sri Lanka are both at elevated risk of sovereign default, and have net inbound remittances that are sizable shares of own GDP,” she added. Much of the impact depends on which country and sector immigrants and migrants worked in. Migrant workers in the United States who originally came from Latin America and Asia were at higher risk of job losses, Citi said, and consequently would send less money home. In April, the World Bank estimated that global remittances were set to tumble by $142 billion in 2020, the sharpest fall in recent history."

The $300 billion Public Investment Fund (PIF) has been buying minority stakes in companies across the world, taking advantage of market weakness in the wake of the coronavirus outbreak. The PIF disclosed stakes worth $713.7 million in Boeing, ABOUT $522 million in Citigroup, $522 million in Facebook, $495.8 million in Disney and $487.6 million in Bank of America, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing bit.ly/3e2A01B on Friday showed. The PIF has a nearly $514 million stake in Marriott and a small holding in Berkshire Hathaway, according to the filing. The PIF also disclosed an $827.7 million stake in oil company BP, which has American Depository Receipts (ADRs) listed in the United States. “The Saudi sovereign fund went shopping in Q1,” tweeted Ali Al-Salim, co-founder of Dubai-based consulting firm Arkan Partners, adding that it now held about $10 billion in U.S.-listed equities, up from $2 billion at the start of the year. PIF’s strategy is two-pronged; building an international portfolio of investments and investing locally in projects that will help reduce Saudi Arabia’s reliance on oil. “PIF is a patient investor with a long-term horizon. As such, we actively seek strategic opportunities both in Saudi Arabia and globally that have strong potential to generate significant long-term returns while further benefiting the people of Saudi Arabia and driving the country’s economic growth,” the sovereign wealth fund said in a statement. “These opportunities include sectors and companies that are well positioned to drive economies and lead sectors moving forward.” The PIF has separately funded almost half of Japanese investor SoftBank’s $100 billion Vision Fund, which has been hit by losses on technology bets. Last month the PFI’s head, Yasir al-Rumayyan, said it was looking into investment opportunities in areas such as aviation, oil and gas, and entertainment, adding that there would be a lot of potential for investment opportunities once the coronavirus crisis passes. The PIF disclosed an 8.2% stake in coronavirus-hit Carnival Corp in April, sending the cruise operator’s shares nearly 30% higher. The Saudi fund bought stakes in Royal Dutch Shell, Total, Eni and Equinor earlier this year , a source familiar with the transactions told Reuters on April 9.

The sale, which is expected to be launched next week in a two-round process, could see Eni all but exit from Australia. Eni declined to comment, while Citi was not immediately available for comment. The Italian group has chosen to sell the assets to raise cash after the global downturn resulting from the coronavirus pandemic led to a sharp drop in oil prices, one of the sources said. Eni’s operations in Australia are mostly based on selling natural gas into the domestic market and therefore are less exposed to global demand and price fluctuations, the source said, making them a potentially attractive target for buyers. Eni, led by oil veteran Claudio Descalzi who was reappointed CEO this week for a third term, operates a series of offshore gas fields in the north of Australia and has stakes in four exploration licences, including the Joint Petroleum Development Area in the Timor Sea. It owns the Blacktip Gas Project in the shallow waters off the Northern Territory, and has stakes in the Bayu-Undan gas and condensate field and the associated Darwin LNG plant. In March Australia's Santos Ltd STO.AX agreed to sell 25% of the Darwin LNG facility and the Bayu-Undan gas field off Northern Australia to South Korea's SK E&S for $390 million. Another source said the assets could be worth $700-900 million, with the bulk linked to the Blacktip gas field, which has a long-term gas supply agreement tied to it. A third source said it had not yet been decided whether the Katherine solar project Eni acquired last year in northern Australia, which has not yet started production, will be included in the sale. Eni, which has pledged to reduce its oil production from 2025, is investing heavily in renewable energy as part of a drive to slash its greenhouse gas emissions by 80% in one of the energy sector’s most ambitious clean-up drives. Like other rivals it has cut production forecasts and investments as it looks to raise cash to fight the coronavirus crisis, which has destroyed oil and gas demand."

9.75256672995445," JPMorgan poaches Citi's Torun to build up senior Paris ranks LONDON (Reuters) - JPMorgan JPM.N is betting on a female banker to take the reins of its investment banking business in France as it seeks to bolster its leadership in one of Europe's hardest-hit markets from the coronavirus pandemic. The Wall Street bank has snapped up Citigroup's C.N co-head of France investment banking, Maja Torun, to take on a similar job at the helm of its own franchise, according to a memo sent to staff which confirmed an earlier Reuters report. Torun, who will start her new role in July, will also join the bank’s France management committee. The move comes as big banks and corporate boardrooms in Europe are trying to fill the gender gap and open up more top jobs for women. JPMorgan kept a focus on diversity during its latest leadership reshuffling in February when it promoted two female bankers, Dorothee Blessing and Anu Aiyengar, to two power-sharing roles as co-head of EMEA investment banking and co-head of global M&A, respectively. In her new Paris-based role Torun will be part of a small circle of female banking leaders in the French capital which also includes BNP Paribas’ Sophie Javary, Goldman Sachs’s Anne Bizien and Citi’s Laurence Parisot. JPMorgan’s France boss Kyril Courboin, who sent out the memo, said that Torun will mainly focus on deepening the bank’s client franchise while working in close partnership with its existing senior team. But Torun’s appointment comes with the challenge of a bleak economic environment, with France bracing for a series of rescue deals, nationalizations and restructurings in the coming months. The French economy sank 6% in the first quarter of 2020 in its sharpest slowdown since World War Two. The novel coronavirus has forced the country into a prolonged lockdown, paralysing business activity and claiming more than 23,000 lives. Torun, a specialist in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) who joined Citi in 2016 from Deutsche Bank, will lead JPMorgan’s efforts to win business from cash-strapped companies seeking help to stay afloat and fend off pressure from a growing number of activist investors in France. She fills a vacant role that will reunite her with a former Deutsche Bank colleague, Marc Pandraud, who has chaired JPMorgan’s investment banking for France and Belgium since 2016. Torun first met Pandraud at Merrill Lynch where they both worked before the financial crisis forced the bank into a rescue merger with Bank of America BAC.N. She then rose through the ranks quickly at Citi, winning the top job as the bank's co-head of France investment banking alongside Emmanuel Regniez in 2019 and leaving her mark after Citi topped up M&A league tables in France last year ahead of Goldman Sachs GS.N and Morgan Stanley. Torun worked on some of France’s most prominent deals in recent years including the merger of Essilor and Luxottica and Publicis’s acquisition of Epsilon. Conor Hillery, who co-heads JPMorgan’s EMEA investment banking unit, praised her ability to “build trust with clients naturally,” saying she was a “first class adviser.” Torun, who holds an MBA from French business school INSEAD, will report to both Kyril Courboin, who runs France as senior country officer, and Tanguy Piret, who heads the banking business across France, Belgium and Luxembourg."

11.328167363273502," UPDATE 1-Brazil economic outlook darkens as Citi predicts 'worst annual contraction ever' (Adds detail, comment) BRASILIA, April 27 (Reuters) - The outlook for Brazil’s economy continues to deteriorate, a series of surveys on Monday showed, as economists at global bank Citi slashed its 2020 forecast and predicted “the worst annual contraction ever” this year. Citing more widespread and lasting damage from the COVID-19 crisis than previously thought, Citi’s economists said gross domestic product in Latin America’s largest economy will shrink 4.5% this year, versus an earlier forecast of a 1.7% decline. That would be deeper than the 4.25% contraction in 1981, the biggest annual fall in output going back to at least 1962, according to central bank data. The World Bank and International Monetary Fund are penciling in a contraction of 5% or more. “We now expect a GDP drop of 4.5% in 2020, with the unemployment rate peaking close to 17% in the (third quarter),” they wrote in a note on Monday. “The preliminary information that encompasses the shutdown period revealed that the current GDP drop will likely surpass the one seen in the 2008/09 Great Financial Crisis,” they wrote. Inflation this year will come in at 2.40%, below the lower band of the central bank’s target range, prompting a further 100 basis points of interest rate cuts over the next two months, they added. Meanwhile, the average 2020 growth forecast of more than 100 financial institutions in the central bank’s weekly “FOCUS” survey on Monday showed the eleventh consecutive decline to -3.3% this year from -3.0% last week. Also on Monday surveys carried out by the Getulio Vargas Foundation (FGV) showed that consumer and business confidence fell to the lowest on record in April, with the outlook suggesting no sign of improvement in the coming months. The FGV’s consumer confidence index fell 22.0 points to 58.2, the lowest since the index was launched in 2005, and its business confidence index posted a record fall of 26.9 points in April to a new low of 61.2. “Pessimism surrounding the coming months is homogeneous across income groups. It is difficult to see a significant improvement in the coming months, given the high level of economic and political uncertainty,” said consumer confidence survey coordinator Viviane Seda Bittencourt."

22.235719783989598," Citigroup profit tumbles 46% on expected credit card losses (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc C.N reported a 46% plunge in quarterly profit on Wednesday as it prepared for losses driven primarily by its credit card business, and analysts raised worries that there is more pain to come as the economic outlook darkens. Wall Street banks are bracing for a flood of defaults by cash-strapped customers after the novel coronavirus outbreak shuttered businesses, put millions out of work and has put the United States on course for a deep recession. But Citi’s high exposure to unsecured credit card loans makes the bank more susceptible to hefty writedowns, since credit card delinquencies have historically risen in lockstep with unemployment. At the same time, Citi has fewer other businesses to make up for the revenue hit, analysts said. “They don’t have the same kind of profitability or profit buffers that could absorb the hit as much as, say, JPMorgan has,” UBS analyst Saul Martinez said in an interview. Citi’s shares shortly before the closing bell on Wall Street were down 5.8% at $42.81. Citi said its U.S. card businesses, which accounted for 16% of its net income in 2019, were responsible for half of the additional $4.9 billion in reserves the company set aside at the end of March for expected loan losses. The increase in provisions caused the bank’s U.S. business to report a loss of $837 million in the first quarter. The company said its loss expectations were based on factors including rising unemployment and falling gross domestic product, the outlook for both of which is worsening. Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason told analysts it was “reasonable to expect” further loss provisioning in the quarter, depending in part on whether government programs to help struggling Americans are successful. He was reluctant to give an indication of how much pain the bank expects to face in coming quarters, despite analysts’ pushing for more details on how Citi factored economic contraction and unemployment into its first-quarter loss provisions. Card spending was down 30% overall during the last week of March and that trend has continued as people have stayed at home. Mason said he expects revenue from spending and borrowing with Citigroup cards to fall in the second quarter. The third largest card issuer in the United States, according to the Nilson Report, Citi has been leaning on its self-branded cards for U.S. growth, with net income in that business increasing 10% in 2019. The retail services card business, which issues credit cards for stores like Home Depot, Macy’s and L.L. Bean, grew profit by 8%.The new loss reserves are equal to 9.5% of outstanding U.S. card loans. The rate of actual losses in the first quarter was 3.46% of Citi-branded card loans and 5.53% of store-brand loans. The bank said the transition to a new credit loss accounting standard also caused it to hold more loss reserves compared with the previous rules. On Tuesday, JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, the biggest U.S. credit card issuer, reported its quarterly profit plunged by more than two-thirds, largely due to $3.8 billion of additional credit card loss reserves, while Bank of AmericaBAC.N set aside roughly $800 million to cover credit losses related to the coronavirus outbreak.[nL3N2C32UV][nL3N2C22TW] Analysts have said Bank of America’s credit risk positioning will likely lead to smaller losses. The blow to Citi’s earnings was partly cushioned by a surge in trading fees as trading desks cashed in on the turbulent markets in February and March. Both Citi’s equities and fixed-income trading businesses reported a 39% jump from the year earlier quarter. Total revenue rose to $20.73 billion, topping Wall Street’s estimate of $19 billion, according to Refinitiv data. Total net income fell to $2.52 billion, or $1.05 per share, in the three months ended March 31, from $4.71 billion, or $1.87 per share, a year earlier. Earnings per share reflect a 10% reduction in shares outstanding. Analysts on average had expected Citigroup to earn $1.04 per share. Total end-of-period loans grew 8%, excluding foreign-exchange fluctuations, while deposits jumped 17%."

22.235719783989598," UPDATE 1-Citigroup profit nearly halves as loan defaults loom (Adds details on quarterly results) April 15 (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc reported a 46% plunge in quarterly profit on Wednesday as the bank set aside nearly $5 billion to prepare for an expected flood of defaults on loans due to a virtual halt in economic activity caused by the coronavirus pandemic. The novel coronavirus outbreak has temporarily shuttered businesses around the globe, put millions out of work in the United States alone and is expected to cause the deepest recession in recent memory. Citigroup, the most global of the U.S. banks, recorded a $4.89 billion expense to increase its reserves against anticipated losses on loans, primarily from its credit cards because of the rising unemployment. Lenders with more exposure to unsecured loans like credit cards are more susceptible to hefty writedowns, as credit card delinquencies have historically risen in lockstep with unemployment. JPMorgan Chase & Co said on Tuesday its profit plunged by more than two-thirds from a year earlier mostly because of $7 billion addition to loan loss reserves, half of which were for credit cards. JPMorgan and Citigroup are the first and third biggest card issuers, respectively, in the United States. Citigroup, unlike JPMorgan, also issues cards under the brand names of retailers including Home Depot, Macy’s and L.L. Bean. Citigroup has been leaning on its North America branded cards division to generate the bulk of its consumer banking revenue. The business continued to deliver in the quarter, growing 7% on higher volume. The blow to earnings was cushioned by higher-than-expected revenue due to a surge in fees as trading desks cashed in on the turbulent markets in February and March.

13.012106830314002," Trading gains for big U.S. banks may not last past first quarter NEW YORK (Reuters) - Big U.S. banks made a pretty penny in trading during the first quarter as the coronavirus pandemic caused wild market swings, analysts said, but those gains will likely be overshadowed by declines in other businesses and a bleak outlook for the rest of the year. Trading revenue could be up from 8% to 20% when the five big Wall Street banks – JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, Bank of America Corp BAC.N, Citigroup Inc C.N, Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N and Morgan Stanley MS.N – report results this week, according to five estimates gathered by Reuters. A note of caution was sounded by a sixth, Chris Kotowski of Oppenheimer & Co, who penciled in double-digit revenue declines for some banks because “these kinds of markets almost always lead to some trading inventory losses.” Nonetheless, Kotowski favors banks with heavy exposure to trading, betting they will fare better than those with large lending businesses. That dark optimism reflects the state of banking today. Bread-and-butter businesses that take in, lend out, process and manage money for individuals and companies are struggling as the novel coronavirus has infected hundreds of thousands of people in the United States alone, shut down businesses and set the stage for a global recession. (tmsnrt.rs/2RqR9sT) Shifting updates about the novel coronavirus and government responses during the first quarter created volatility that allowed trading businesses to perform well, analysts said. Stock markets plunged and soared day-to-day in a manner not seen in at least a decade, while bond markets reacted to the U.S. Federal Reserve’s cutting interest rates and pouring trillions of dollars into financial markets to address liquidity issues. Teams that handle stocks, Treasury bonds and foreign-exchange swaps likely did better than those in corporate credit, where there was severe stress at times, analysts said. Average daily volumes on Tradeweb Markets Inc TW.O, which operates electronic trading platforms for fixed income and equities, were up 39% in the quarter from a year earlier, the company reported. But activity began dissipating by late March, and few expect it to return as the year goes on. “Good temporary news for the big banks is trading was really good in 1Q,” Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr said in a recent report. The last time Wall Street banks experienced this kind of dynamic was the first quarter of 2009. Investors were worried that banks were in serious trouble, only to learn that government stimulus programs had created a trading boon, which held up through most of that year. But coronavirus volatility may turn out to be quite different, analysts said. Banks have dramatically restructured their trading businesses since then, and bursts of trading activity have become much more fleeting, even when they are extreme. “If we look back to, like, 2Q ‘18 when we had that sharp market correction, it took several quarters in a good economy for that trading activity to come back,” Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck said in an interview. “With this economy it’s going to take a little bit longer.”"

The deal, slated to occur later this year dependent on financial market conditions, will be led by China Merchants Bank International, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N and could value the Chinese online health platform at up to $10 billion. The people with direct knowledge declined to be identified because they were not authorised to speak with media on the matter. Citigroup and WeDoctor spokesmen declined to comment on the bank’s appointment. Credit Suisse was working on the transaction but was dropped due to uncertainty surrounding a regulatory probe of Luckin Coffee Inc LK.O. The Swiss bank worked on Luckin Coffee's IPO last year and follow-on equity deals in January. Investment bankers from rival firms began pitching to WeDoctor this week to pick up the extra role, people close to the process told Reuters. Luckin Coffee is at the centre of a Chinese Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) investigation after the firm said an internal review found its chief operating officer and other staff fabricated sales transactions worth about 2.2 billion yuan ($311.58 million).

27.18379554563597," Citigroup will temporarily close up to 15% of U.S. branches (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc C.N said on Tuesday it will temporarily shutter up to 15% of its U.S. branches amid the coronavirus outbreak. “As our clients and communities increasingly self-isolate, we have noticed shifts in foot traffic and market dynamics - so to best meet our changing customer needs we have begun to temporarily close branches,” spokesman Drew Benson said. The closures are expected to be in effect by the end of the week. Citigroup has roughly 700 branches primarily located in 6 cities across the U.S. The third largest U.S. lender said it would also temporarily reduce branch hours and redeploy staff to ensure access to essential services. Citi’s move follows other large banks who have begun to scale back some retail operations in order to reduce the spread of the coronavirus while keeping critical banking services like accessing deposits available to customers. JPMorgan Chase and Co JPM.N, the largest U.S. bank, said last week it would temporarily shut about 20% of its branch network leaving it with roughly 4,000 locations. Bank of America Corp BAC.N said it has reduced operating hours at its branches. Banks have largely been excluded from government-mandated shutdowns across the country because they are considered an essential industry by the federal government, meaning most bank branches, call centers and trading floors have stayed open even as many firms sent their employees home. On Tuesday, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin backed the Department of Homeland Security’s designation of the financial services workforce as critical infrastructure workers, and said employees who provide consumer access to banking and lending services should maintain their normal schedules amid state and local shutdown orders."

Citi said that one employee was confirmed to have the virus, and JPMorgan confirmed that two of its employees do. The announcements followed similar news from banks such as Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N, Morgan Stanley MS.N and others, as the flu-like virus continues to spread in the United States and worldwide. JPMorgan spokesman Brian Marchiony said two employees at the bank’s midtown Manhattan headquarters have the virus and have been at home receiving treatment since earlier this week. “They are both doing well at this time,” Marchiony said by email. The bank has asked employees who came into close contact with the individuals to work from home for two weeks. Citi said its employee who has tested positive for the virus was last in the office on March 6 and was diagnosed Friday while on personal travel to Singapore. The Citi employee did not exhibit any symptoms while he was in the office and did not visit any Citi facilities while traveling, the bank said. Citi has given employees who worked on the same floor as that colleague the option to work from home. Both banks have already taken measures to limit the spread of the virus, including splitting its North American workforce, imposing business travel restrictions, limiting large meetings and, at Citi, putting up reminders to practice social distancing. Both banks said they are rigorously cleaning all office spaces regularly. JPMorgan Chase said it is deep cleaning both employees’ work spaces in addition to the normal cleaning measures."

The third largest U.S. bank will this week keep fewer than 60% of its Buffalo-based staff at its main site, with the rest either working from home or at a back-up site near Rochester, NY, the source said. Citigroup has around 1,800 employees at the Buffalo location, many of whom work in operational roles. Banks in the world’s largest finance hubs like New York and London have been splitting up trading teams and activating backup offices in a bid to contain the spread of the virus. Citigroup’s latest move shows contingency planning has now extended to smaller cities as well. The number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in New York state rose to 105 on Sunday, up from 89 the day before, according the state governor’s office. Governor Andrew Cuomo issued a declaration of emergency on Sunday as the pace of confirmed cases accelerated. As of Sunday there were no confirmed cases in Eerie County where Buffalo is located. Twelve people have tested positive in New York City, where Citigroup is headquartered. JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, Bank of America Corp BAC.N, and Morgan Stanley MS.N split some of their Manhattan-based teams last week.

Effective Monday, impacted customers will be eligible to have monthly bank account fees and certificate of deposit penalties waived. Citigroup said it would also provide hardship programs and additional small-business support, such as extended banker availability. “This is a rapidly evolving situation and we want our customers to know we are here to provide assistance should they need it,” said Anand Selva, chief executive of Citi’s U.S. Consumer Bank. In the United States, the coronavirus outbreak has spread to 22 states. The U.S. death toll on Friday stood at 15, with more than 230 cases. Worldwide, the number of people infected with the coronavirus surpassed 100,000 on Friday. The outbreak has killed more than 3,400 people and spread across more than 90 nations. Industry experts have raised concerns over how the illness could impact markets if consumers curb spending. “Another week or so of growing COVID-19 contagion, canceled events, foregone travel and shuttered businesses will lead to waves of delinquent debt from Americans with no other choice,” said Karen Petrou, managing partner of Federal Financial Analytics. “One longstanding lesson of economic history is that liquidity crises descend into solvency debacles if not quickly resolved.” Officials, including Dallas Federal Reserve Bank President Robert Kaplan, have been mulling whether to ask banks to consider adopting forbearance programs to help consumers who are squeezed financially by the pandemic. The Federal Reserve has urged banks to take similar steps during natural disasters like Hurricane Michael and during the government shut down."

Citi has told staff heading to Italy’s financial capital Milan or other northern cities to postpone their trips or seek approval from top management if they are working on sensitive deals, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity as banking policies are confidential. Credit Suisse has also informed bankers looking to travel to and from Northern Italy including airports in Milan and Bologna that they will require extra permissions, two of the sources said. Nomura has instead taken a more rigorous approach putting all countries affected by coronavirus deaths on a blacklist, including Italy and France, and banning staff from travelling there, they said. The Japanese bank has also told employees working locally in Milan and Paris that they cannot book business trips to visit clients abroad, one of the sources said. “They are all grounded,” this source said referring to Nomura’s bankers. Citi, Credit Suisse and Nomura declined to comment. The curbs come as coronavirus infections have soared across northern Italy over the past few days, causing seven deaths and more than 200 cases. It is the first time banks have restricted trips within Europe as most financial institutions have so far only applied travel bans to mainland China, imposing a 14-day quarantine to those who had recently returned. Most bankers in London who want to see clients in Italy fear they will have to go through the same quarantine policies when flying back to London, the sources said. “Managers have hinted at a shorter quarantine of one week rather than the standard fortnight but it is not clear yet,” said a London-based banker whose employer had warned staff against booking trips to Italy. Milan-based Mediobanca and UniCredit have also banned all non-essential trips, both inside and outside Italy, two sources said. In a statement on Monday UniCredit said it has introduced “a ban on non-essential domestic and international travel” as a precautionary measure. It also told staff living near the worst affected towns in northern Italy to work from home.

-42.47074532789368," Citi, Deutsche start talks to sell $9 billion Dubai port company debt: sources DUBAI (Reuters) - Citi C.N and Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE have started talks with other banks to sell roughly $9 billion in debt Dubai raised to take full control of DP World DPW.DI and refinance borrowings of Dubai World, sources familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. Dubai announced this week one of its state companies, Port and Free Zone World (PFZW), part of state investment vehicle Dubai World, aims to buy publicly listed shares of port operator DP World in a deal with a $13.9 billion valuation which will end up adding billions of dollars of debt to DP World’s books. Citi and Deutsche Bank have underwritten roughly $9 billion of debt for the transaction and have started discussions with other lenders to decrease their exposure by distributing the debt, the sources said. The banks declined to comment. DP World did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Dubai World, a conglomerate with interests in ports, real estate and hospitality, signed a $25 billion debt restructuring agreement in 2011 after Dubai was hit by the global financial crisis. DP World’s planned de-listing will add leverage to the company, which pushed rating agencies Moody’s and Fitch to put the firm under review this week for a potential downgrade. As part of the deal, DP World will borrow $5.15 billion to fund a dividend to Dubai World, which is the sole shareholder of PFZW, helping it meet outstanding obligations to lenders. “The sizable dividend payment to Dubai World breaks our current assumption that DP World’s credit profile is unaffected by the debt burden at the level of Dubai World,” Moody’s said. The $9 billion in debt includes the dividend payment, $2.7 billion for the purchase of the listed shares, and the refinancing of some debt maturities, said one of the sources. “New money for the deal is only the one needed to buy the shares, the rest is just refinancing,” he said. After the 2009 debt crisis, Dubai had to rely on $20 billion in bailout loans from Abu Dhabi and the UAE central bank to stave off a sovereign default. Fitch said last year that Dubai may need to again restructure a significant part of $23 billion in loans raised by Dubai government-related entities and due to mature by the end of next year. One of the sources said that while the DP World de-listing involves a debt repayment for Dubai World, the deal was not engineered to consolidate Dubai’s debt or extend its maturities.

The U.S. bank now expects gross domestic product growth of 2.0% this year, down from 2.2% previously, and becomes the latest major bank to lower its outlook for Latin America’s largest economy. The 2.0% growth figure represents a psychological threshold Brazilian policymakers will be keen to hurdle this year, following three years of weak recovery and subdued growth around 1% following the 2015-16 recession. “The significant downward revision in China’s Q1 2020 GDP growth expectation ... will likely mean a global headwind for the Brazilian economy through the export channel,” Citi’s Leonardo Porto and Paulo Lopes wrote in a note on Tuesday, noting that China accounts for 28% of all Brazilian exports. Porto and Lopes now expect 2.0% GDP growth in each calendar year out to 2024. They also lowered their 2020 inflation forecast to 3.5% from 3.8%, well below the central bank’s official 4.00% target, and now expect the central bank to keep its benchmark Selic interest rate at a record low 4.25% well into next year."
-40.50692441252144," Citigroup mandated for Turkish gas distributor Enerya sale - sources ISTANBUL (Reuters) - STFA Investment Holding and Swiss Partners Group Holding PGHN.S have mandated Citigroup for a potential sale of Enerya, a leading natural gas distributor in Turkey, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. The sources, who requested anonymity, said the two partners were considering options including selling all shares in the company. STFA Investment Holding and Swiss Partners Group, which took a 30% stake in Enerya in 2014, declined to respond to questions on the plan. Citigroup Inc C.N did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Enerya sold 1.4 billion cubic meters of natural gas in the nine distribution regions that it controls in 2018, according to the Energy Market Regulatory Authority’s (EPDK) most recent data. This level of sales indicates that Enerya controls 6.4% of the annual 22 billion cubic meter natural gas distribution sector in Turkey, or some 6% of the natural gas customers in the country. STFA Investment Holding said in its 2017 operating report, the latest one available, that Enerya’s annual sales were 1.7 billion lira ($281 million). One energy sector source said the distribution sector, whose tariffs are set by the EPDK, had a fixed profit margin and offered a steady flow of revenues. “The number of subscribers is clear, the consumption volume is clear. It is a company that offers very stable revenue and profit,” the source said. “Companies which bring natural gas to Turkey or those who are already present and who want to increase their gas distribution activities may show interest.” The source added that despite Turkey’s very low asset valuation levels, “I don’t think a new foreign investor is likely to show interest” because the country has been seen as a risky bet since a currency crisis in 2018."

Corbat's total compensation included a base salary of $1.5 million plus cash bonuses of about $6.75 million, equity awards of nearly $7.9 million, and a long-term performance based pay worth $7.9 million. (bit.ly/2uPC4Jd) Members of the board considered the bank’s 2019 operating performance, market levels of pay for the CEO role at peer institutions, and Corbat’s leadership while deciding his compensation, according to the filing. For 2019, Citigroup reported returns on tangible common equity of 12.1%, beating its 12% target. Though the biggest U.S. banks largely reported a year of strong top and bottom line growth, executive compensation remained subdued as bank boards have become more cost-conscious reflecting a weaker revenue outlook. Morgan Stanley's MS.N board made the rare move of cutting CEO James Gorman's pay by 7% to $27 million for 2019 in an effort to reduce expenses. Bank of America Corp BAC.N CEO Brian Moynihan's pay package was flat from a year ago and JPMorgan Chase & Co's JPM.N board gave CEO Jamie Dimon just a half-million-dollar raise, following a $2 million dollar raise the year before. A year earlier, Corbat enjoyed a 4.35% raise, bringing his total compensation for 2018 to $24 million. In 2018, the bank exceeded its goal for returns on investment but fell short of its efficiency target due to revenue pressure at the end of the year."

-46.050992170559375," Australia investigator met other regulators before Citi, Deutsche charges SYDNEY (Reuters) - An Australian investigator who helped bring criminal cartel charges against Citigroup Inc C.N and Deutsche Bank AG DBKGn.DE told a court he met agents from another regulator in a cafe to discuss the matter but the talks were ""high level"" only. Citi, Deutsche, their client Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd ANZ.AX and several of their current and former executives are accused of forming an agreement during an A$2.5 billion ($1.7 billion) ANZ stock issue to withhold selling unwanted shares to prevent them from falling when they hit the market in 2015. In pre-trial hearings, lawyers for the banks and their staff have suggested witnesses for the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), which brought the charges in Australia’s biggest white collar criminal case, relied on evidence that was tainted by outside influences and pressure from above. ACCC enforcement director Michael Taylor was asked on Friday about a meeting with two investigators from another regulator, corporate watchdog the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) in a Sydney cafe in early 2016, more than two years before charges were laid. “They would have told me they where they were at,” Taylor told the packed Sydney court room, referring to the cafe meeting. “They might have said, ‘we have’ or ‘we are about to issue notice,” he added, referring to notices which ASIC issued to the banks telling them they were under investigation. Taylor denied “careful coordination” with ASIC, and said his meetings with its investigators were “very short” and “at a very high level”. ASIC did not specify who they had issued notices on, other than the corporate entities, he added. Asked if he had requested ASIC get him recordings of two August 2015 conference calls between the bankers in which they allegedly discussed the share sale, evidence at the heart of the case, Taylor said, “it could have been discussed”. “I just heard that they had done this. I didn’t ask them to do it,” he told the court. Asked why he had not kept an email or other record of the cafe meeting, Taylor said the ACCC “team knew I was meeting with them. There were lots of things that weren’t necessary to put in an email.” The case is being closely watched by investment bankers around the world because it could have implications on the way they are allowed to run share sales. If found guilty, the banks face hefty fines while the individuals face prison time. A year and a half since the charges were brought, the matter is still at a pre-trial stage and none of the accused has entered a formal plea, although all have said they will plead not guilty. The hearings continue."
-43.68724464594938," Australia investigator in Citi cartel case learned of concerns from rival agency SYDNEY (Reuters) - An Australian investigator who helped bring criminal cartel charges against Citigroup Inc C.N and Deutsche Bank AG DBKGn.DE said he first heard concerns about a stock issue they worked on from a rival regulator, but the agencies acted independently. The disclosure on Tuesday in a pre-trial court hearing relates to a central part of the defense against the country’s biggest white collar criminal case: the investment banks want to show the evidence used to charge them was tainted by outside influences and departure from due process. The banks, their client Australia and New Zealand Banking Group ANZ.AX and several current and former executives are charged with colluding during a 2015 stock issue for ANZ to withold unsold shares and keep the stock from falling. A third investment bank which worked on the share sale, JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, cooperated with authorities in exchange for immunity. In a second day of testimony, Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) enforcement director Michael Taylor said corporate regulator the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC) was first to tell him about concerns to do with the capital raising. “The investment banks may not have been entirely truthful with ANZ bank, I recall that coming up,” Taylor told a packed Sydney courtroom, referring to conversations with ASIC. “I became aware that there was some suggestion that bids for shares had been placed by the investment banks to fill the book,” Taylor added. The ASIC investigation focused on suspected insider trading and suspected failure to fulfill obligations for the investment banks to act in clients’ best interests, while ACCC pursued inquiries into suspected antitrust breaches, and the two were “quite separate”, he said. More than a year and a half since the charges were brought, the matter is yet to go to trial and none of the accused has entered a formal plea, but all have said they will plead not guilty. The case is being closely watched by investment bankers around the world because it could have implications about the way they are allowed to run share sales. If found guilty, the banks face hefty fines while their staff and former staff face prison time. JPMorgan’s local head of compliance, Oliver Bainbridge, meanwhile told the court he began making internal inquiries about the capital raising less than a week after it took place after being instructed to by a regional compliance boss. “We listened to some audio recordings in the days after the capital raising,” said Bainbridge. Bainbridge did not elaborate on the recordings. He told the court he gave a witness statement after lengthy sessions at the ACCC offices in Sydney, but said he was not involved in discussions between his employer and the regulator about cooperating in exchange for immunity. The hearing continues on Wednesday."

-36.869468799537515," Regulators scrutinized in Australia cartel case against Citi, Deutsche, JPM SYDNEY (Reuters) - Two Australian regulators may have agreed not to pursue JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N over its role in a criminal cartel case in exchange for its help in prosecuting the other banks involved, a lawyer for another bank told a court on Thursday. The investment bank and two rivals, Citigroup Inc C.N and Deutsche Bank AG DBKGn.DE, worked on a A$2.5 billion stock issue for retail lender Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd ANZ.AX in 2015. Those banks and their former executives - but not JPMorgan - have been charged with criminal cartel behavior. Regulators say they agreed to keep some of the stock to prop up its price, and a pre-trial hearing has heard JPMorgan cooperated with the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) in exchange for immunity. A lawyer for ANZ told the court on Thursday his client was seeking documents detailing contact between the ACCC and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), a corporate regulator that was not directly involved in bringing the charges. “It would ... be an abuse of power if ASIC had decided not to bring (separate) proceedings against JPMorgan for the reason that the ACCC had successfully put pressure on them to do so,” said ANZ’s lawyer, Tim Game. Game later told the court he was not alleging misconduct by either regulator, but rather that he wanted to see their communications. The regulators have resisted handing over some of the documents the defense has sought. “There is no evidence whatsoever suggesting that ASIC is engaging in any of that conduct,” ASIC lawyer Sue McNicol told the court. The case is being closely watched by investment bankers around the world because it could influence how they are allowed to conduct joint capital raisings. A year and half after the charges were brought, no trial date has been set and none of the accused - Citi, Deutsche, ANZ and several of their staff and ex-staff - have entered a formal plea. All have said they will fight the charges, which carry prison terms. The pre-trial hearings will resume in Sydney’s Downing Centre Local Court on Friday."

Kalvaria also told the Reuters Global Markets Forum on Thursday that Citi’s overall market share across advisory, syndicate lending, equity and debt origination rose in 2019, but attracting and retaining talent is challenging in the business. Below are excerpts from the chat, held on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland: Question (Q) - Is geopolitical uncertainty keeping some corporate clients, who would otherwise be looking for deals or other financing, on the sidelines? Answer (A) - I don’t think geopolitical uncertainties are affecting clients who are looking to do strategic transactions. However, that said, obviously outbound mergers and acquisitions (M&A) from China has gone down considerably, but other cross border M&A remains reasonably strong. Q - Many of Citigroup’s competitors are going down market to look for growth since there is more competition for the biggest deals but fewer of them. Why hasn’t Citi followed suit? A - We are not going down market because we do not believe that’s the right phraseology. What we are doing is spending significant time on smaller emerging growth companies, which we believe, over time, will be winners within their sub-sectors. Those companies are candidates for initial public offerings, merger and acquisition (M&A) opportunities and other potential services that we can bring to bear as they grow globally. Q - How has the era of “unicorns” changed the way Citigroup sources new clients? A - The era of unicorns relates to the earlier question about covering smaller companies. The unicorn valuations help highlight companies with great potential for us to cover and are very helpful in the areas we should invest in from the people standpoint. Q - In 2018, Citi’s overall market share across advisory, syndicate lending and equity and debt origination rose to 5.1%, from 4.9%. How is the effort to capture more market share progressing and what are the biggest hurdles? A - We continue to increase market share in 2019 slowly and carefully. The hurdles remain in retaining and attracting the best talent. This is a people business and we have to ensure that we have the best. Q - How will the corporate banking landscape change, given recent consolidation in the capital markets industry. Will fewer players in equity or debt impact the other corporate banking business lines? A - Corporate banking business will remain a broad global business. Obviously the big 3 American corporate banks continue to enjoy a very strong position in the marketplace and remain very strong. But they (face) competition from leading banks in Asia and Europe. In terms of fixed income and equities, some players have retreated to some extent and that has given other players the opportunity to pick up market share.

That was a slight improvement of two percentage points from last year, according to an internal analysis. In similar job positions in the same location, women on average are paid 99% of what men are paid, on a par with last year’s results, the bank said. Citigroup began disclosing “raw” pay gap figures globally last year in response to shareholder pressure to disclose how much less it pays women than men. A British law that went into effect in 2018 forced corporations to disclose unadjusted pay gap figures for their operations in that country annually, but Citi is the only bank that voluntarily discloses the global metrics. “As we’ve said before, transparency breeds accountability and we took that important first step last year in disclosing our pay equity results,” head of global human resources Sara Wechter said in a statement. “We know the pressure to make progress will continue and we welcome it.” For minorities in the United States, Citi said the median pay was 94% of the median for non-minorities, up from 93% last year. The third-largest U.S. bank has said it wants female employees to hold at least 40% of roles at assistant vice-president level through to managing director level by the end of 2021, with 8% of such roles in the United States held by black employees.

-44.18124187102703," Citigroup beats estimates on credit card, trading revenue growth (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc beat analysts’ estimates for fourth-quarter profits on Tuesday, boosted by growth in its credit card business and a jump in trading revenue. North American branded cards, which account for a majority of the bank’s consumer banking revenue, clocked double-digit revenue growth for the second straight quarter, rising 10% from a year earlier. The third-largest U.S. bank by assets has been leveraging its robust card business to help grow deposits by pitching checking and savings accounts to card holders. The bank gathered $6 billion in digital deposits last year. Markets and securities revenue rose 28% as markets steadied during the last three months of 2019, with the gains driven by a 49% surge in fixed-income trading. Equities trading fell 23% due to weak performance in derivatives. Citi also reached a key profitability target. The bank hit a return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) of 12.1% for 2019, above the goal of 12% it promised investors for the year. ROTCE is a widely watched measure of how well a bank uses shareholder money to generate profits. The bank, however, reduced its guidance for 2020 ROTCE to a range of 12% to 13%, down from prior guidance of 13.5%. “The revenue environment has changed since we set our targets for 2020, with lower interest rates, slower global growth and the pressure we’ve seen in industry wallets in markets and banking,” Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason said on the bank’s earnings call. The U.S. Federal Reserve cut interest rates three times last year, crimping banks’ lending margins and their ability to raise revenue. Citi added loans and deposits in the most recent quarter from both consumer and corporate clients as business sentiment began to improve. Total end-of-period loans grew 2%, while deposits jumped 6%, excluding foreign-exchange fluctuations. Credit costs jumped 15%. Net interest income, or the difference between what a bank pays for deposits and earns from loans, was up 1% at Citi, compared with declines at JPMorgan and Wells Fargo & Co. Net income applicable to common shareholders rose to $4.98 billion, or $2.15 per share, in the three months ended Dec. 31, from $4.31 billion, or $1.64 per share, a year earlier.

-41.73652262701694," Citi's corporate banking arm aims to pick up steam as market cools down (Reuters) - When Citigroup Inc C.N combined businesses that cater to big companies in 2018, management wanted dealmakers, traders and traditional corporate bankers to combine forces and propel Citi toward the top of Wall Street market-share rankings. The third-largest U.S. bank has made some progress. Its overall market share across advisory, syndicate lending and equity and debt origination edged up to 5.1%, from 4.9% in 2018. But Citi’s rankings in those business lines were unchanged in 2019, according to Dealogic data. In December, bankers from Citigroup’s capital markets, investment banking and corporate lending teams gathered for their first full-year review meetings since the groups were combined. The tone in the meetings was positive, executives said, but after a year of stagnant rankings the unit still has a lot of work to do. Citigroup has struggled to gain traction since it has yet to snatch away meaningful market share from powerful incumbents like JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N, and Morgan Stanley MS.N. And, as it moves along with its strategy in 2020, the outlook is not great, industry insiders and analysts said. Trade wars, recession fears and international events — ranging from Brexit to Hong Kong protests to political chaos in Venezuela to the United States killing an Iranian leader this month — have unpredictable outcomes that affect prices of goods and services in local markets, as well as global companies’ ability to acquire or transact between them. The geopolitical uncertainty is also keeping some corporate clients, who would otherwise be looking for deals or other financing, on the sidelines, executives have said. However, Citi’s expertise as a deeply international bank that helps companies grow and do business across borders, may not position them well for the current business trends, said Marty Mosby analyst at stock broker-dealer Vining Sparks. “The world that was becoming more and more integrated is becoming less integrated and becoming a little bit more isolated,” he said. “And that’s not to Citigroup’s advantage.” The values of global dealmaking and initial public offerings industry wide are each expected to drop more than 20% this year according to estimates by law firm Baker McKenzie. “The investment banking business has never been more demanding,” said Tyler Dickson, the New York-based co-head of Citi’s Banking Capital Markets and Advisory group. Citigroup has prided itself on being the most global of the big banks for decades, but after the 2007-2009 financial crisis, it pulled back from many regions and businesses. Even so, the bank still operates in 98 countries, partly to ensure that multinational clients have access to markets in which they operate. Citigroup executives say they can win business from big corporations, even if the overall industry revenue pie shrinks. Last year, the bank was able to grow the transaction value of the deals it advised by 11% despite the wallet being down 2% for the industry, according to Refinitiv data. Citigroup can still capture market share even with bleak 2020 outlook, Dickson said. Dickson is co-head alongside Manolo Falco, who is based in London. On the first anniversary of their professional marriage, the two sent balloons and a cake, respectively, to the other’s office to celebrate a job well done. The bank is focused on getting more business from existing corporate customers and adding new companies that fit into a certain rubric, executives told Reuters. That includes technology and healthcare companies, as well as small-but-promising startups that might grow fast. But the bank is not looking to gain share among smaller mid-sized companies that competitors including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America or Goldman Sachs are targeting. “Between the two growth paths, I like that path better,” said Cary Kochman, Citi’s co-head global head of M&A."

-32.741969382185616," 'Out of market today': Australia brandishes four words crucial to case against Citi, Deutsche SYDNEY (Reuters) - A four-word handwritten note by a JPMorgan Chase & Co banker has been seized by Australian prosecutors as fundamental to a criminal cartel prosecution against Citigroup Inc and Deutsche Bank AG, a court heard on Friday. The note, which said “out of market today”, was taken by JPMorgan compliance chief Oliver Bainbridge at the time of a conference call with the other two banks, and prosecutors say it shows the three agreed to refrain from selling stock from a 2015 capital raising to boost its price, the court heard. “Mr Bainbridge has made contemporaneous notes with the words ‘out of market today’,” said Jennifer Giles, a local court magistrate presiding over the case which is yet to go to trial. Prosecutors say the note “seems to have been corroborated by what happened in the market,” Giles added. Though brief, the note’s existence may be used to support a federal case accusing the three banks of agreeing to withhold unsold stock from a A$2.5 billion capital raising for retail lender Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd, misleading retail shareholders and violating cartel laws. The case, brought by antitrust regulator the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), is being closely watched by investment bankers around the world because it could influence how they are allowed to conduct joint capital raisings. JPMorgan and several of its staff and ex-staff, including Bainbridge, have agreed to act as prosecution witnesses in exchange for immunity, the court has previously heard. Defence lawyers have been questioning the JPMorgan witnesses about how they came to cooperate with the authorities, how their signed statements were drafted and who was involved. So far, all of the witnesses said they did not take notes of the conference calls at the heart of the case. A day earlier, another JPMorgan witness who was on the calls, the bank’s local markets head Jeff Herbert-Smith, told the court the banks had not colluded on the capital raising, and that he was surprised when he was approached by the ACCC. Bainbridge lives overseas and will probably be called to testify in February, the court heard on Friday. A year and half since the charges were brought, no trial date has been set and none of the accused - Citi, Deutsche, ANZ and several of their staff and ex-staff - has entered a formal plea, but all have said they will fight the charges which carry prison terms. The pre-trial hearings will resume in Sydney’s Downing Centre Local Court on Jan. 30."
-32.741969382185616," Citi, Credit Suisse drop China's Ucommune U.S. IPO over valuation -sources SYDNEY/HONG KONG (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc C.N and Credit Suisse Group AG CSGN.S have dropped out of the U.S. initial public offering of Chinese shared workspace provider Ucommune, baulking at its desired valuation, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said. Ucommune’s latest filing with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission lists Chinese banks Haitong International and China Renaissance as leading the planned IPO. Earlier filings had named Citigroup and Credit Suisse, but both walked away over the past few days because they could not agree an achievable valuation with Ucommune, the people said, declining to be identified because the information was private. Ucommune did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while Citigroup and Credit Suisse declined to comment. “There was a big gap between what the company had hoped to achieve and where the market is sitting now,” one of the people said, adding that pressure for a higher valuation also came from some investors who took stakes in recent private funding rounds. The valuation that Ucommune is pursuing and the valuation that Credit Suisse and Citi believed possible could not be learned. The banks also had concerns about Ucommune’s rapid timeline to complete its IPO, another of the sources said. The company is eyeing a listing as soon as early January, the source added. Data provider Dealogic told Reuters on Thursday it was not aware of any company ever going public on a U.S. exchange without a Western bank, as would be the case with Ucommune. It is possible that a Western bank will still join Ucommune’s IPO syndicate before its stock market debut, one of the sources said. In recent months, Credit Suisse has also exited the U.S. IPOs of Chinese drone maker Ehang EH.O and Chinese cryptocurrency mining equipment maker Canaan CAN.O before their listings, according to regulatory filings. Credit Suisse declined to comment on these IPOs. Ucommune raised $200 million in November last year, giving the Beijing-based group a valuation of $2.6 billion. At least one adviser warned Ucommune in recent weeks that it would likely get a lower valuation from its IPO - a so-called down round when the latest funding gives a company a lower valuation than the preceding one - one of the sources said. Ucommune refused to accept the advice, the source added. While Ucommune’s preliminary filing did not provide any details of the size of the offering, sources previously told Reuters it was aiming to raise about $200 million. Reuters revealed Ucommune’s IPO plans in October in the week that larger U.S.-based rival WeWork was forced to accept a $10 billion bailout after investors, eying its mounting losses, baulked at the valuation it sought from its IPO. Ucommune, which says it has shared workspaces in 200 locations across 44 cities including Beijing, Shanghai, Hong Kong, Los Angeles and New York, posted a net loss of 572.8 million yuan ($81 million) for the nine months to the end of September on revenue of 874.6 million yuan. Its IPO push comes just as Ping An Insurance’s OneConnect Financial Technology cut its planned U.S. IPO and lowered its target valuation to up to $3.64 billion, well below the $7.5 billion in its maiden funding round last year."

-43.48237855733849," JPMorgan witness in Australia cartel case says no collusion with Citi, Deutsche SYDNEY (Reuters) - A prosecution witness in an Australian criminal cartel case against Citigroup Inc C.N and Deutsche Bank AG DBKGn.DE testified he had just 30 seconds' notice about an underwriting conference call and that there was no collusion. The testimony from former JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N markets head Jeff Herbert-Smith appears to be at odds with the prosecution's case that the three banks and their client Australia and New Zealand Banking Group ANZ.AX agreed to withhold details about a A$2.5 billion ANZ share sale in 2015 to support the stock. The case, in which JPMorgan has been given immunity in exchange for cooperating with the authorities, is being closely watched by investment banks around the world because it could influence how they are allowed to conduct capital raisings. Prosecutors have argued that discussions on two conference calls in August 2015 between bankers on the deal amounted to an agreement to not tell investors that underwriters were buying some of the stock. But Herbert-Smith, who was on the calls, told a Sydney court in a pre-trial hearing that the staff of the three banks decided to withhold information about the share sale independently and there was no agreement. “I had 30 seconds’ notice, and three seconds to make up my mind,” Herbert-Smith said of one of the calls. “I was flying blind on the phone call.” Seven months later, in March 2016, when he was told the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) wanted to speak to him, Herbert-Smith said, “I couldn’t believe it, I was somewhat surprised”. Herbert-Smith’s lawyer, Philip Strickland, asked: “You didn’t consider that you were involved in cartel behavior, is that correct?” “That’s correct,” Herbert-Smith responded. According to his lawyer, Herbert-Smith told other bankers on the call that “we are comfortable with our risk position (and) we are going to stand on it”. “There was no prior agreement ... relating to those lines you’ve just recited,” Herbert-Smith said. Herbert-Smith said that when he met an ACCC investigator in March 2016, the investigator found it hard to believe three people on the same call made the same decision independently. “I disagreed. Maybe it was familiarity with capital markets,” he said. Defence lawyers have been questioning Herbert-Smith and two other JPMorgan staffers involved in the stock issue to determine how they came to give their sworn witness statements and who was involved. The defense has previously suggested the JPMorgan evidence may have been contaminated by the involvement of the ACCC and other regulators. On Thursday, Herbert-Smith said he met the ACCC about six times before signing a statement that would be used to prosecute the other banks, he said. The banks and their staff and former staff have declined to comment on the case outside of what is said in court. All of the accused have said they will defend the case, which is yet to go to trial, but none has entered a formal plea. The hearing will resume on Friday."

-26.169809625102182," Australia cartel case against Citi, Deutsche delayed by late night witness statement SYDNEY (Reuters) - An Australian criminal cartel lawsuit against Citigroup Inc C.N and Deutsche Bank AG DBKGn.DE was postponed on Tuesday after defense lawyers complained the prosecution had given them a redacted statement for a key witness late on the previous day. Though for just one day, the delay raises the chance of pre-trial hearings running into next year, eroding hopes of a swift resolution to a case that is being closely watched by investment bankers around the world since it may change how they run capital raising. The two investment banks and their former client, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ANZ) ANZ.AX, and several of their former executives are charged with withholding information from investors about a A$2.5 billion ($1.7 billion) share issue for ANZ in 2015. Defence lawyers had planned on Tuesday to start cross-examining investigators from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), which brought the charges, about how they took witness statements from a third investment bank, JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, which also worked on the stock issue but cooperated in exchange for immunity. But the defense told the court on Tuesday they had been given what they deemed a crucial ACCC investigator’s signed statement, running to about 100 pages with some information obscured, at 9.30 p.m. local time on Monday. That meant they could not proceed with questioning as planned, it said. “It is particularly troubling that we are provided with these statements in this way at this time,” Citigroup lawyer Dean Jordan told a pre-trial hearing in Sydney. The defense had been trying to get information from the regulator about its case outside the courtroom “for a year (but) it’s fair to say the response has been less than helpful”, Jordan said. “It is entirely regrettable that it’s unfolding in this way.” The magistrate overseeing the hearing, Jennifer Giles, said the delay may mean the cross examination would run into 2020, instead of ending on Dec. 13 as planned. But she held over the questioning until Thursday. The ACCC has said the banks colluded on the share issue, at the expense of ordinary shareholders, during two conference calls during the stock issue to keep the stock price aloft. None of the defendant banks or their former staff has entered a formal plea but all have said they plan to fight the charges which carry prison sentences. Their lawyers have previously told the court they plan to question whether the JPMorgan banker statements were “contaminated” by the involvement of ACCC investigators. The regulator and banks have routinely declined to comment on the case outside the courtroom. ($1 = 1.4736 Australian dollars)"

-9.0484294343305," Bank of England hits Citigroup with biggest fine to date LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England fined Citigroup C.N 43.9 million pounds ($56.3 million) on Tuesday, saying the U.S. banking group's British operations failed to provide it with accurate regulatory returns between 2014 and 2018. Imposing its biggest fine to date, the Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA), the BoE’s banking supervisory arm, said Citigroup’s UK framework for reporting data to regulators was not designed, implemented or operating effectively. It is mandatory for banks to report a broad range of data so that regulators can check that they are not taking on too much risk or holding too little capital as a buffer against market shocks. “While Citi remained in surplus to its liquidity and capital requirements at all times, the failings persisted over a significant length of time and were serious and widespread in nature,” the BoE said. Some of the regulatory returns were unreliable and did not provide the PRA with an accurate picture of the bank’s capital or liquidity position, it added. “Citi failed to deliver accurate returns and failed to meet the standards of governance and oversight of regulatory reporting which we expect of a systemically important bank,” BoE Deputy Governor and PRA Chief Executive Sam Woods said. The U.S. bank said it has fully dealt with the past regulatory issues and settled the matter at the earliest possible opportunity. “Citi places a high priority on meeting its regulatory reporting requirements, and has devoted significant resources to UK financial reporting before, during and after the period to which the PRA’s notice relates,” the bank said in a statement. “Citi co-operated fully with the PRA throughout the process, and in 2019 a leading independent accountancy and audit firm confirmed that Citi had remediated the material issues identified.” The PRA said the fine would have been $62.7 million had Citi not agreed to resolve the matter early."

7.5954325706656585," London forex trader accuses Citigroup of unfair dismissal LONDON (Reuters) - A former top Citigroup C.N trader, who was fired in 2014 but acquitted of foreign exchange-rigging charges after a trial in New York, told a London employment tribunal he was unfairly dismissed despite being in the ""eye of the storm"" at the time. Rohan Ramchandani, who headed European spot forex trading, has already filed a $112 million-plus case against Citigroup in New York, alleging the bank framed him by making false and malicious statements to U.S. prosecutors after sacking him. Citigroup, which has paid more than $2 billion in fines and civil settlements to date over forex allegations, says it will vigorously contest Ramchandani’s claims. “Individual accountability continues to be important to Citi, and for that reason we are disputing Ramchandani’s request for compensation, reinstatement and re-engagement at the employment tribunal,” it said in a statement. The former Citigroup veteran, who says he first heard of his dismissal when his manager phoned him on holiday in India, told the east London tribunal on Wednesday he had had no opportunity to explain potentially confusing or misleading electronic chats. Ramchandani conceded that his name was bandied about in news reports in 2013 as British and U.S. authorities honed in on allegations of price-fixing in the $6.6 trillion-per-day currency markets. But he told the tribunal: “I do not accept it was fair for me to put me on leave when the bank said there were issues about my chats (electronic communications).” Ramchandani alleges he was fired without a disciplinary process and was given no right of appeal. The former trader, whose annual pay stood at around 1.0 million pounds, is seeking a pay-out of around 80,000 pounds ($102,000) and either his old job back or a comparable role. But if the court agrees he should be reinstated or re-engaged in a different role, he is eligible for compensation equal to the pay and benefits he would have accrued if he had not been dismissed. The former London-based trader was one of three who were members of electronic chatrooms in which dealers were alleged to have shared sensitive client order information. A global investigation into alleged forex manipulation, that kicked off in 2013, resulted in some of the world’s biggest banks paying fines of more than $11 billion. Dozens of traders were fired. Citibank, which says Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) watchdog prohibited it from sharing information with Ramchandani about chats it had identified as concerning, has conceded that his dismissal was “procedurally unfair”. But it alleges that senior managers “were clear that his conduct had precipitated an irreparable breakdown in trust and confidence”."

The two banks plus JP Morgan Chase & Co JPM.N worked on a A$3 billion ($2 billion) stock issue for Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ANZ) ANZ.AX in 2015. Citi, Deutsche, ANZ and eight of their staff were charged last year with withholding crucial information from shareholders about the sale. JP Morgan was granted immunity from prosecution when two of its former executives agreed to co-operate with regulators. However, lawyers for the defence have said they want to question staff of the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) in court about how they obtained evidence from the JP Morgan representatives. The ACCC opposed their request. On Friday, a local court magistrate ruled that the defendants’ lawyers may cross-examine the ACCC staff on the subjects of how they obtained witness statements from the JP Morgan personnel and the staff’s level of cooperation with corporate regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. “The defence does not have an unfettered right to cross-examine witnesses (but) I’m not persuaded that I can or should oppose,” the magistrate, Jennifer Atkinson told the court in Sydney. “There will be examination of the following witnesses,” Atkinson said, before naming the four ACCC staff. Spokespeople for the ACCC, Citi, Deutsche and JP Morgan declined to comment. Prosecutors have accused the banks of forming a criminal cartel to restrict the supply of ANZ shares and maintain the price of ANZ shares after they were unable to sell them all to regular investors, court documents showed. Four phone calls in August 2015, which prosecutors said involved bankers from all the companies, are at the heart of the case. None of the accused companies or people have entered formal pleas and no trial date has been set, but all have said they would plead not guilty. The case could have major implications for the underwriting business and lead to increased scrutiny from regulators worldwide. State prosecutors had opposed allowing the ACCC officers to testify, saying it may violate legal privilege and inappropriately expose the regulator’s private workings. The next hearing is on Dec. 5."

Citi’s current CEO, Michael Corbat, said the move did not suggest an imminent change at the top of the bank. However, promoting someone into a president role typically means that person is being groomed for the top spot. That position has been vacant since former head of Citi institutional clients group, Jamie Forese, left the bank earlier this year. “I remain committed to leading our firm in the coming years and look forward to working even more closely with Jane in her new roles,” Corbat said in the statement. Fraser, 52, has been seen as a rising star on Wall Street, and was recently reported to be among the candidates Wells Fargo & Co's WFC.N board was considering for its next CEO. That bank settled on another executive. A 15-years veteran at Citi, who first joined to run client strategy in the investment bank, Fraser had been running the bank’s Latin America business, including its Citibanamex division in Mexico, for the past few years. She ran Citi’s private bank and its troubled mortgage business, and is credited internally with helping the bank recover after the financial crisis, when it had to take $45 billion in taxpayer funds to survive. Before then, Fraser was a McKinsey consultant, and has spent much of her career hopping between countries and regions developing a global approach to business strategy. She will be succeeded in Latin America by Ernesto Torres Cantu, who had been CEO of Citibanamex. Bird, the outgoing Citi global consumer business head, was last month reported to be one of the shortlisted external candidates for the role of HSBC Holdings Plc's HSBA.L chief executive. A HSBC spokesman in Hong Kong declined to comment on the move on Friday. HSBC, which makes more than 80% of its profit in Asia, began a search for a new chief executive in August after ousting John Flint following just 18 months in that role. The bank appointed its global commercial banking unit head Noel Quinn as interim CEO. HSBC Chairman Mark Tucker said in August that the search for a new chief executive, which will include both internal and external candidates, could take up to a year. London-headquartered HSBC will report its third-quarterly results on Monday. Before becoming head of global consumer banking at Citi, Bird was chief executive of the U.S. bank’s Asia Pacific business, responsible for all of Citi’s consumer and institutional businesses across 17 markets in the region. Prior to joining Citi in 1998 in Singapore as the bank’s Asia Pacific head for operations and technology, Bird - who was also a Citi executive management team member - held senior management positions in GE Capital and British Steel in the U.K."

17.38482148351397," Citigroup names Peter Babej as Asia Pacific chief executive: memo HONG KONG (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc C.N has named Peter Babej, the U.S. bank's global head of financial institutions group, as its new Asia Pacific chief executive officer, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters on Thursday. Babej joined Citi in 2010 as co-head of the financial institutions group after having previously worked at Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE and investment bank Lazard LAZ.N, according to the memo sent to staff by Citi global CEO Mike Corbat. A spokesman for Citi in Hong Kong confirmed the contents of the memo. Babej, who is currently based in New York and will relocate to Hong Kong, will replace Francisco Aristeguieta, who left Citi earlier this year to join custodian bank State Street Corp STT.N as chief executive of its international business. Citi’s business in Asia Pacific is the second largest region-wise in terms of revenue, outside of its home market of North America, and contributes around one-fifth of its revenues and nearly one-third of the bank’s net income. In the quarter ended Sept. 30, Citi’s Asia Pacific revenue grew 7% to $4.01 billion. Babej has been involved in several Asia-focused merger and acquisition transactions in the financial sector, Corbat wrote in the memo, adding the new regional head will take over the role immediately. “He will draw on his deep knowledge of the financial services landscape in Asia, where we continue to see great opportunities, including fast-growing digital adoption,” Corbat said in the memo."

14.884410651182472," Consumer banking powers Citigroup's profit beat (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc C.N reported higher-than-expected earnings on Tuesday off the back of its global consumer business, showing consumer spending and sentiment remain high. Citi, the most global of the U.S. banks, said profit in its consumer unit rose 13% excluding the impact of currency fluctuations, outpacing its institutional client business where revenue inched up 1%. The consumer business was helped by more U.S. credit card customers beginning to pay interest as promotional periods wore off. North America branded card revenue jumped 11% in the third quarter, and profit in the U.S. consumer business jumped 9%. Expenses in the consumer business fell 2%, partially offset by rising credit costs which have increased every quarter this year. Citi has been leaning on its U.S. credit card business, which accounts for more than 60% of its global consumer banking revenue, to help it grow deposits by pitching checking and savings accounts to card holders. Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason said that strategy has helped them earn more than $4 billion in digital deposits this year, most of which came from areas where the bank does not have a physical presence. The U.S. consumer proved to be more resilient than the corporate sector where clients continued to show more caution reflecting macroeconomic uncertainty. JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N also reported strong results in its consumer business. Trading revenue fell 1% as a decline in equities offset stable revenue in fixed-income trading. JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N both reported a rise in revenue from bond trading. Citi also reached a key profitability target. The third-largest U.S. bank by assets hit a return on tangible common equity (ROTCE) of 12.2%, above the goal of 12% it has promised investors for the year. ROTCE is a widely watched measure of how well a bank uses shareholder money to generate profits. Citi has been focused on building credibility with investors after missing targets in recent years. Estimates often hovered below the bank’s stated goals, indicating Wall Street analysts were skeptical management could reach the targets it had set. The performance on ROTCE may be hard to replicate in the fourth quarter without the one-time tax benefit which boosted earnings by 10 cents a share. Net income applicable to the bank rose 6% to $4.9 billion, or $2.07 per share, in the third quarter from $4.6 billion, or $1.73 per share, a year earlier. Excluding a tax benefit, the bank earned $1.97 per share. Revenue was up about 1% at $18.57 billion. Analysts were expecting a profit of $1.95 per share and revenue of $18.5 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv."

14.884410651182472," Citigroup plans to set up wholly-owned securities business in China: sources HONG KONG (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc C.N plans to set up a wholly-owned securities business in China, people with knowledge of the matter said on Tuesday, taking advantage of Beijing's move to fully open up some of its financial sectors to foreigners next year. Citi is currently in the process of completing its exit from a minority-owned securities joint venture in China, a process that one of the sources said is expected to be completed by end of this year. The exit, which was first announced late last year, was seen as paving the way for the U.S. bank to set up its own brokerage in the world’s second-largest economy. Citi’s plans to set up a wholly-owned securities business in China are in the early stages, said the sources, who declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the matter. Bloomberg first reported the development. “Citi continues to evaluate opportunities to further support its clients in China,” a spokesman for the bank said in an emailed statement, declining to give details. Global investment banks are currently able to own up to 51% of their China operations. That requires a joint venture with local Chinese partners. Beijing has pledged to ease foreign ownership limits in the financial sector over a period of time. Last week, China announced a firm timetable for opening its futures, brokerage and mutual fund sectors fully to foreign investors next year, the latest step to deregulate the country’s trillions of dollars worth of financial industry. Limits on foreign ownership of securities firms will be removed on Dec. 1, 2020. The China Securities Regulatory Commission will start taking in applications in the second quarter of 2020, and plans to give at least couple of licenses for wholly-owned securities business by end of the year, said a source with knowledge of the plans. Citi, which has a large retail and corporate banking presence in China, will become one of the first foreign banks to set up a wholly-owned securities business in China, if the plans are finalised. French lender Societe Generale SOGN.PA has also ditched a plan for a securities joint venture in China in favor of a wholly-owned subsidiary, a senior executive of the bank said over the weekend."
15.872294590455983," Citi pays $30 million fine to settle real-estate violations: regulator WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Citibank has agreed to pay a $30 million fine to settle charges of repeated violations of real estate holding rules and for failing to meet its commitment to take corrective actions, the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) said on Friday. Federal law limits the time a national bank may hold foreclosed and “other real estate owned” (OREO) assets. In 2015, Citi said it lacked adequate processes to effectively monitor the holding period, and committed to developing and taking corrective actions, but it did not do so, the OCC said. As a result, between 2017 and 2019, the bank committed over 200 violations in South Dakota related to the statutory holding period for OREO assets.

20.344341094388074," Citi says ten-year bull market 'old, but not dead' LONDON (Reuters) - Citi says it is too early to call the end of the current 10-year bull market and expects global equities to rise by another 9% by the end of 2020, although it warns the threat of recession is the biggest risk facing markets. Citi’s outlook, entitled “Bull Market: Old, But Not Dead” and released on Thursday, comes after global stock markets took a beating this week amid signs of a slowdown in U.S. economic growth and as weak earnings fan fears that trade tensions could push the global economy into a recession. Equities have lost more than $1.2 trillion in market value so far this week, according to Refinitiv DataStream. Citi equity strategists, however, say they expect central banks will continue to respond to slowing economies in 2020, as they have done this year, and U.S. equities will lead the way higher as a result. They acknowledge the risk of earnings downgrades, saying growth estimates of 10% by several analysts and strategists are too high. “Downgrades are unhelpful, although not fatal for stock markets,” Citi equity strategists said, adding that Europe and emerging markets were “most vulnerable” to downgrades. “Since 1989, analysts’ first global EPS (earnings per share) forecast has been too high ..., but in 15 of those (21 years, including 2019) global equities still rose.”"
23.469080241470955," London forex trader sues Citigroup over 'malicious' forex prosecution LONDON (Reuters) - A London-based former Citigroup C.N trader is suing the U.S. bank for more than $112 million, alleging it made materially false and malicious statements to U.S. prosecutors that led to his trial in New York on foreign exchange-rigging charges. Rohan Ramchandani, the former European head of Citigroup’s forex spot market trading desk, alleges in a lawsuit filed on Wednesday that Citigroup made false and “gravely derogatory” assertions against him to government investigators and the media after firing him in 2014 without cause. “Ultimately, Citi quite literally fabricated an antitrust case for the United States Department of Justice against Ramchandani based upon knowingly false allegations that he engaged in market ‘manipulation’ and ‘collusion’,” read the complaint filed in the federal court in Manhattan. A spokeswoman for Citigroup in London said the bank rejected the allegations and would fight the case. “Mr. Ramchandani’s claims of malicious prosecution are without merit and we will contest them vigorously,” she said. A New York jury last year cleared Ramchandani, alongside two other London-based currency traders, of scheming to rig benchmark exchange rates in the $5.3 trillion-per-day foreign exchange markets after just hours of deliberation. The verdict was a blow for U.S. authorities, which alongside Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) had fined some of the world’s most powerful banks -- including Citigroup -- a total of around $10 billion over the foreign exchange scandal. The UK Serious Fraud Office (SFO) abandoned its own criminal investigation into currency rigging allegations in 2016, saying it lacked sufficient evidence for a successful prosecution. Ramchandani alleges that a Citigroup lawyer, who is not named in the filings but who he said had “full knowledge” of the facts, had recognized that he had not engaged in intentional wrongful conduct or violated any law or regulation. He also alleges his manager at Citigroup, an experienced forex spot market trader tasked with reviewing and evaluating Ramchandani’s communications, had volunteered that Ramchandani had not engaged in “collusion or price fixing” and there was “nothing criminal” in his intent or actions. Citigroup only pleaded guilty in May 2015 to conspiring to manipulate currencies in order to pin the blame on Ramchandani and to limit the regulatory consequences for their senior managers and officers, the former trader alleged. Ramchandani alleged that although he had been acquitted, Citigroup’s conduct had cost him tens of millions of dollars, damaged his reputation and ended his successful and well-paid professional career. He is demanding a trial by jury."

14.017545388074728," National Australia Bank, Citi latest to predict October cash rate cut SYDNEY (Reuters) - National Australia Bank economists on Friday became the latest to join a growing pool of analysts predicting a third interest rate cut by the country’s central bank in October, citing slowing economic growth and a smaller chance of fiscal support. Financial futures <0#YIB:> are now pricing an 80% chance of cut by the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) in October to a record low 0.75%, up from a 50-50 probability before data out on Thursday showed the country’s unemployment rate had increased to a one-year high of 5.3% in August. An October cut would follow two back-to-back cuts in June and July to 1%. NAB brought forward the next RBA cut to October, with a follow-up move in December, senior economist Gareth Spence wrote in a note, from previous predictions for November and February. Earlier in the day, Citi economist Josh Williamson pulled forward his call to October, from November previously. “We previously anticipated some further support from fiscal policy but now believe this is unlikely in the near term,” NAB’s Spence added. “With monetary policy involving longer lags, we think the urgency to lower rates sooner has increased.” On Thursday, Commonwealth Bank of Australia CBA.AX brought forward its forecast rate cut by a month to October after the labor force data. With CBA and NAB's revision, the ""big four"" Australian banks including Westpac WBC.AX and ANZ ANZ.AX are all predicting a cut in October. Also on Thursday, Australia’s center-right government announced the budget was in balance for the first time in 11 years and a surplus next year was all but certain. The government has repeatedly said it is not prepared to significantly boost spending to revive growth and inflation. Citi’s Josh Williamson said “early evidence” indicated that household saving would continue to outstrip spending amid ongoing low wages growth, rising income taxes and falling consumer sentiment. He also cited an increase in global downside risks for bringing forward his rate cut call, noting a recent jump in oil prices could temper household spending while slower growth in China was a major overhang for Australia’s export-heavy economy."

12.688056342415532," From underpants to oat drink makers, Citigroup courts startups for growth (Reuters) - At an event hosted by Citigroup Inc C.N this month, its dealmakers sat executives from major consumer-product companies alongside rivals trying to disrupt their businesses. The idea, bankers said, was to hatch partnerships between old companies that are replete with cash and searching for growth, and fledgling companies that are gobbling up market share and need working capital. One of the blue-chip titans that benefited from Citi's matchmaking was Kimberly Clark Corp KMB.N. Known for selling tissues and diapers, the Irving, Texas-based company made an investment in a direct-to-consumer brand on Tuesday, inking a $25 million deal with period-proof-panty startup Thinx, the startup said. Such tie-ups help Citigroup bankers improve relationships with large-cap clients while also building connections with privately held companies that may one day go public, said Elinor Hoover, Citigroup’s co-head of consumer investment banking. “We do need to have our finger closely on the pulse not only because it’s important to our equity franchise, but it also is important to our mainstream bigger cap clients and our overall advisory business,” Hoover said in an interview. Hoover began organizing Citigroup’s Consumer Disruptive Growth Conference three years ago. At the time, her team did not pay much attention to emerging companies that were quickly grabbing a greater portion of revenue, as well as deal volumes. The Sept. 11 conference attracted nearly 400 attendees, Hoover said. Among them were household names like Kimberly Clark, Hershey Co HSY.N and J.C. Penney Company Inc JCP.N, and startups like beauty-products site Glossier, Swedish oat-drink maker Oatly and e-commerce merchant Brandless. There were also private-equity investors and high-net-worth clients from Citi’s private bank. Citigroup plans to expand this strategy to other sectors, including automotive, media and healthcare, said Paul Abrahimzadeh, head of equity capital markets syndicate for the Americas. The consumer business was a natural place to start, because incumbents there have been disrupted more than in other industries. The average time for companies to remain in the S&P 500 was 24 years in 2016, down from 33 years in 1994, according to market-research provider Innosight. The firm predicts half of the companies now in the S&P 500 will be replaced over the next decade, with the consumer-products industry facing the most upheaval. Citigroup is not the only bank responding to the trend. Bank of America Corp BAC.N has expanded its team of dealmakers who cater to private companies, Chief Operating Officer Tom Montag said at a conference last week. Other Wall Street banks including Morgan Stanley MS.N and Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N have swarmed Silicon Valley, offering advice and capital to hot startups in hopes of winning IPOs, advising on acquisitions or performing capital raises. Part of Citigroup’s strategy has been reorganizing staff to increase collaboration and win more business. Roughly a year ago, its investment bank created the technology and strategy solutions team, which tries to get non-technology companies to think about digital disruption. Sean Rogers, who runs the team, spends his time pitching manufacturers, retailers and other conventional companies on deals and partnerships with startups. Citigroup also integrated teams that focus on raising capital in public and private markets, because companies sometimes need to consider both options, Abrahimzadeh said. Its dealmakers are also collaborating more closely with commercial bankers and wealth managers to build relationships with up-and-coming companies and put them on larger clients’ radars, executives said. Banks have little choice but to cater to companies in their near-infancy because of interest from investors and corporations, said Leon Kalvaria, chairman of Citi’s institutional clients group. “Big companies are all interested in it on a senior management and board level,” he said. “"
9.299660844433362," Citigroup stands by card strategy despite economic clouds NEW YORK (Reuters) - Some Wall Street analysts have begun to question whether Citigroup Inc's C.N big bet on credit cards will backfire if the U.S. economy enters a recession, despite the bank saying it is underwriting responsibly. The New York-based lender is the third-largest card issuer by payments, according to industry publication The Nilson Report. Its card business accounts for one-third of overall revenue and half the profits of its consumer business. Citigroup is also among the most aggressive promoters of zero-interest balance transfers, according to market research firms that track the data. Those deals tend to lure borrowers with debt burdens rather than affluent spenders who chase rewards. Citi offers four credit cards with zero-interest balance transfers. Most major rivals offer one or two cards with the 0% offer, according to Ted Rossman, a credit card industry analyst at consumer finance company Bankrate LLC. The bank also offers the longest interest-free period on the market with one of its cards at 21 months, compared to an industry average of 12.16 months, according to credit monitoring site WalletHub’s analysis. “The risk is Citigroup is over-indexed to credit cards,” said Wells Fargo banking analyst Mike Mayo. “We are worrying every day about what could go wrong.” Still, with the card business continuing to perform well, Mayo has given a “buy” rating to Citigroup stock, which is up 35% so far this year. Citigroup spokeswoman Elizabeth Fogarty said the bank is lending responsibly, through balance transfer offers as well as other products. “They are one lever within a strategic, balanced growth strategy,” Fogarty said. “We diligently monitor market and environmental conditions on a continuous basis and will make adjustments as needed,” she added. Some analysts say potential downside lies with borrowers like Jacqueline Alvarado, a Pennsylvania truck driver who now owes $12,000 in credit card debt. Over the past five years, Alvarado, 40, says she has moved balances around on 19 cards, including one from Citigroup. If 0% promotional offers dry up, she said, so do her hopes of paying off that debt. “That’s the only way I can stay afloat,” she said. “This works out for me for now, until they change it.” Citigroup executives emphasize that strong underwriting procedures will prevent catastrophic losses, and that they are sticking with the card strategy because it is crucial to hit growth targets. Citigroup’s card delinquency rates are far below the industry average, according to federal data and filings. (For a graphic on Citigroup's credit card delinquencies and charge-offs, see: tmsnrt.rs/2ZtH9QF) After this article was first published on September 6, Citigroup provided data to show its mail promotions of 0% balance transfer offers have declined significantly over the past two years. Citigroup now accounts for 13% of those deals, down from 25% in the fourth quarter of 2017, statistics from third-party research firm Mintel Group Ltd show. It remains one of the top three promoters, according to the data. The other two are Discover Financial Services DFS.N and Capital One Financial Corp COF.N. Discover, known for flooding mailboxes with promotions, has said on earnings calls it is pulling back on promotional offers and tightening personal loan underwriting due to concerns about the economy. Capital One, which pioneered balance transfers in the early 1990s, said on public investor calls it has become more conservative in extending credit while targeting wealthier clients who typically do not carry balances. The two companies declined to comment for this article. Customers who apply for balance transfers are considered riskier than those that don’t because they often use the offers to rack up more debt, several underwriters and banking analysts said. “It’s a fine line between finding customers who need your product and customers who will also be good customers and pay their bill,” said Julian Kheel, a card expert at personal finance site The Points Guy. RELYING ON PLASTIC After receiving three taxpayer bailouts to survive during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, Citigroup exited many businesses and narrowed its focus to a few key areas, including cards. Today, its card business is an important driver of deposit growth. By marketing online checking and savings accounts to its 28 million cardholders, Citigroup was able to add $2 billion in consumer deposits during the first half of 2019, executives said. That is more than double what it gathered all of last year, the executives said. Though the customers who sign up for those deals may be riskier, Citigroup is betting they will stick around once promotional periods expire. At that point, they face annual percentage rates of up to 27%, according to sites that compare cards. Citigroup’s interest-bearing balances rose 10% in the second quarter versus the year-ago period. That growth helped boost overall profits on consumer lending by 9%, according to its financial statements. “The good news is this is not Citigroup 2007,” said Mayo, the bank analyst. “There is better risk control, better awareness of potential pitfalls and frankly a stronger consumer.” Citigroup started scaling back promotional offers in 2017, but executives say they believe the bank now has the right mix of customers — both in 0% and interest-bearing accounts — to start investing in promotions again. That will help Citigroup grow its card business through next year, Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason said at a conference this week. Citigroup is also adding new features to encourage borrowers to use their cards more. The bank this year introduced a new card that rounds up to the nearest 10 reward points on every new purchase, and rolled out installment loans for large transactions. Anand Selva, head of consumers strategy, said he expects the business to continue picking up steam with the right mix of consumers. “We sort of hit our sweet spot,” Selva said."

15.737280656513676," FOCUS-Citigroup doubles down on credit cards even as U.S. economy softens NEW YORK, Sept 6 (Reuters) - Despite signs that the U.S. economy is slowing, New York-based Citigroup Inc is betting big on credit cards. Citigroup, the third-largest U.S. card issuer, according to payments industry publication The Nilson Report, has been among the most aggressive promoters of zero-interest balance transfers. For a small fee, customers can move debt from a rival card onto Citi’s plastic and pay no interest for 21 months. That is currently the longest 0% deal in the industry, according to consumer finance company Bankrate LLC. Rivals offer 15 interest-free months with no fee. The card business now accounts for nearly one-third of Citigroup’s overall revenue and is one of the biggest potential drivers of future earnings growth. But some analysts and investors worry this portfolio could become a liability if the economy goes south. The bank continues to advertise zero-interest deals on popular personal finance websites and through mailers, even as competitors have scaled back. “Just recognizing where we are in the credit cycle, it’s interesting to see Citigroup doubling down and pushing forward,” said Moody’s analyst Warren Kornfeld. Credit card customers who use balance transfers are considered higher risk because they often use the easy financing to accumulate more debt, according to bank analysts and credit underwriters. Wall Street’s worst fears lie with borrowers such as Jacqueline Alvarado, a Pennsylvania truck driver who now owes $12,000. Over the past five years, Alvarado says she has moved balances around on 19 cards, including one from Citigroup, to avoid finance charges. If the promotional offers dry up, she said, so do her hopes of paying off that debt. Zero interest is “the only way I can stay afloat,” said Alvarado, 40. In interviews with Reuters, Citigroup executives defended their card strategy and tough underwriting standards they say will protect the bank from major losses in the event of a downturn. Citigroup’s card business has reported delinquency rates far below the industry average in recent years, according to federal data and filings. In addition, 83% of consumers in its American credit card business, excluding its retail partnership cards, have credit scores of 680, which is considered a good score, according to credit rating firm Experian. (For a graphic on Citigroup's credit card delinquencies and charge-offs, see: tmsnrt.rs/2ZtH9QF) Citigroup counts on customers sticking around after the promotional period expires. With annual percentage rates of up to 27% on its cards, the profits on borrowers who carry balances can be juicy. The strategy so far is paying off. Interest-bearing balances rose 10% in the second quarter versus the year-ago period. That growth helped boost overall profits on consumer lending by 9%. Anand Selva, the bank’s head of consumer strategy, said he expects the business to continue picking up steam. Citigroup shares have rallied more than 20% so far this year. The KBW Banking Index, the benchmark stock index for the U.S. banking sector, rose 6% over the same period. Selva says Citigroup has taken other steps to encourage cardholders to do more than transfer balances. For example, it has sweetened its reward program by rounding up to the nearest 10 reward points on every new purchase. And it has introduced installment loans linked to credit lines for large purchases. Major card rivals, meanwhile, are proceeding more cautiously. Discover Financial Services, known for flooding mailboxes with promotions, has said on analyst calls that it is paring those offers and tightening personal loan underwriting over concerns the economy is slowing. Capital One Financial Corp , which pioneered balance transfers in the early 1990s, similarly told analysts and investors it has become more conservative in extending credit lines while targeting wealthier clients who typically do not carry balances. Bank of America Corp and JPMorgan Chase & Co , two of the biggest card lenders, have grown their businesses by prioritizing affluent consumers over people already carrying credit card debt, according to analysts. Citigroup has leaned more on its card business since the 2007-2009 financial crisis. The bank required three government bailouts when its U.S. subprime mortgage business turned toxic and caused it to shrink its portfolio to stem losses. It sold its retail wealth management unit to Morgan Stanley , and it no longer engages in traditional mortgage and auto lending. Citigroup now has one-fifth the number of U.S. branches as its primary competitors. So it has turned to its card business to drive growth and lure deposits. The bank now earns more than half of its consumer profit and revenue from cards. And it markets online checking and savings accounts to its 28 million cardholders. Doing so helped Citigroup add $2 billion in consumer deposits during the first half of 2019. That is more than double what it gathered all of last year. Analysts said the business will be a bright spot for Citigroup - as long as the economy remains healthy. U.S. banks suffered $87 billion in losses on credit card loans from 2009-2010 in the wake of the financial crisis, according to a Federal Reserve report. Alvarado, the truck driver, said she has been slowly chipping away at her balance thanks to 0% financing. “This works out for me for now, until they change it,” she said."
13.421800112893456," Citi's Mexican unit expects interest rate cut in September MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Citibanamex, the Mexican unit of Citigroup Inc C.N, said on Thursday that its latest poll of analysts forecast that Mexico's central bank will cut its benchmark overnight lending rate by 25 basis points to 7.75% at its Sept. 26 meeting. In a majority decision, the Bank of Mexico’s five-member board voted at its Aug. 15 meeting to lower the overnight interbank rate by 25 basis points to 8.00%, the first cut since June 2014, citing slowing inflation and increasing slack in the economy. All but two of the 24 analysts polled by Citibanamex said they expect the central bank to cut the rate by a quarter of a percentage point at the September meeting. Citibanamex said the median response of its poll saw the key rate being cut 50 basis points from its current level to 7.50% by the end of the year, from a prior forecast of 7.75%. It also lowered its view for Mexican economic growth in 2019 to 0.5%, from 0.6% previously. Citibanamex reduced its forecast for gross domestic product growth in 2020 to 1.3%, from 1.4%. Late last month, the Bank of Mexico said slack economic conditions will persist for longer than expected, slashing its economic outlook for this year to forecast virtually no growth. It now forecasts growth will range between 0.2% and 0.7% in 2019, down from an earlier prediction of between 0.8% and 1.8%."
16.45245893321783," ANZ, Citi, Deutsche cartel case inches ahead in Australia SYDNEY (Reuters) - An Australian magistrate shifted hearings to a larger room as a long-awaited criminal cartel case against Australia and New Zealand Banking Group ANZ.AX and the local units of Citigroup C.N and Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE inched ahead on Tuesday. Lawyers for each of the banks and individual executives packed out the Sydney courtroom for a short administrative hearing ahead of legal argument scheduled for later this month, giving a sense of the size and complexity of one of the country’s biggest white collar crime prosecutions. The case is being closely followed by brokers and banks globally because it could lead to increased regulator scrutiny. Authorities last year charged the financial giants and six bankers over the 2015 sale of A$3 billion ($2 billion) ANZ shares and subsequent trading by underwriters, saying they colluded to keep from ordinary shareholders the fact that they had not found buyers for all the stock. All the accused banks and executives have said they will fight the case, although they have not yet entered a formal plea. If they plead not guilty, the matter would proceed to trial, although no date has been set. Magistrate Jennifer Atkinson said it appeared the court would need to make room for 20 barristers, an unusually large number in Australia, even for large cases. The room of Sydney’s Downing Centre Local Court normally used for early hearings of commonwealth matters was so crowded, lawyers had to stand behind the bar table that had room for just five chairs. Atkinson also accepted commitments from lawyers on both sides to deliver briefs of evidence to each other a week before the next hearings scheduled for Sept. 25 and 27. At those hearings, lawyers for the banks and bankers will press to be allowed to cross-examine prosecution witnesses, who have not been named yet in hearings. If convicted, the banks could face penalties of A$10 million or triple the benefit of the conduct. The individuals charged could face 10 years in jail. Citi and JP Morgan, which also worked on the 2015 share issue, declined to comment, while Deutsche and ANZ were not immediately available for comment."
17.57099777955782," UK public inflation expectations rise to highest since 2013: Citi/Yougov LONDON (Reuters) - British households’ expectations for inflation in the year ahead rose in August to their highest level since 2013, possibly reflecting the rising chance of a no-deal Brexit, a survey from U.S. bank Citi and pollsters YouGov showed on Friday. The public expects inflation over the next 12 months to rise to 3.2%, up from 2.9% in July. “Such high levels have previously usually been associated with high energy prices,” economists at Citi said in a research note. “However, in the absence of those at the moment, the increase could be driven by rising chances of a rupture with the EU on Oct. 31, which could lead to higher consumer prices via tariffs, supply disruptions and weaker sterling.”"
21.322863288975682," Citi raises minimum wage to $15 per hour (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc. C.N raised its minimum wage to $15 per hour earlier this year following pressure from politicians and similar moves by other big banks. Data released by U.S. Representative Maxine Waters, chair of the House Financial Services Committee, shows that Citi raised its minimum wage in June following a request by the congresswoman for the third largest bank by assets to commit to increasing the minimum wage to $20 per hour. Lawmakers grilled Chief Executive Officer Michael Corbat in April over the disparity between executive pay and compensation for the median worker at Citi. Of the top banks, Citi had the largest pay gap with the Corbat earning 486 times the amount of the median worker. In February, Citi said Corbat would get a 4.35 percent raise, bringing his total compensation for 2018 to $24 million: a base salary of $1.5 million plus cash bonuses of about $6.75 million, equity awards of nearly $7.88 million, and a long-term performance based pay worth $7.88 million. A number of banks raised their minimum wage after receiving large tax cuts following the enactment of the President Donald Trump's corporate tax cuts. JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N raised its minimum wage to $15 and $18 per hour depending on the local cost of living, Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N raised its minimum wage to $15 per hour and Bank of America Corp BAC.N has pledged to raise its minimum wage to $20 by 2021."
21.322863288975682," Burger King's China franchisee hires Citi for stake sale: sources HONG KONG/ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Tab Food Investments (TFI), the biggest worldwide franchisee of Burger King, has asked Citigroup to help to sell a minority stake in the business in China and Turkey, a deal which could fetch at least $200 million, two sources familiar with the matter said. Istanbul-based TFI, founded by the Kurdoglu family, operates nearly 1,700 Burger King outlets in Turkey and China. TFI began investing in China in 2012 and now has a network of more than 1,000 Burger King restaurants in more than 150 Chinese cities, according to its website. The company, also a franchisee of fast-food chicken chain Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen and pizza brand Sbarro, last year postponed reut.rs/2UaQJGU plans for a $220-million initial public offering in New York amid market jitters. TFI wants the value of the potential stake sale to imply an enterprise value of about $1 billion, the sources said. First-round indicative bids will be due by the end of next week, one source, who declined to be named as the information was not public, said. TFI is seeking new partners to help speed up growth in China through new restaurant openings, food-delivery services and digital transformation, the source said. The source also said TFI was considering listing its businesses in China and Turkey, or only the China franchise, in Hong Kong as early as next year. TFI made about $70 million in earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization last year. Its 2019 EBITDA is expected to be about $90 million, one of the sources said. TFI said its China and Turkey operations continue to attract the attention of potential investors. “In the current period, there is an increasing investor interest in our company,” Burcu Bati, TFI’s chief financial officer, told Reuters in an emailed statement. “TFI is always open to evaluate strategic options that would be in the best interest of the company.” Citigroup C.N declined to comment. Burger King's major rivals include KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell brands in China, for which exclusive licenses are held by Yum China YUMC.N, a Yum Brands YUM.N spin-off. McDonald's Corp MCD.N sold the bulk of its China business here to state-backed conglomerate CITIC Ltd 0267.HK and private equity giant Carlyle Group in 2017. TFI's China business is also part-owned by private equity firm Cartesian Capital Group and Restaurant Brands International QSR.TO, the owner of Burger King itself. They own 50%, 22.5% and 27.5% of the China business respectively, according to the IPO prospectus TFI filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission last year."
17.98649188655244," Citigroup's new shipping finance chairman to deepen environmental focus LONDON (Reuters) - Citigroup's C.N veteran shipping finance banker Michael Parker is to become chairman of the bank's shipping & logistics business, a role which will include bolstering the lender's environmental focus in the sector, Citi said on Thursday. In June, Citi was among a group of leading banks who signed up to environmental commitments known as the “Poseidon Principles.” These will for the first time integrate efforts to cut CO2 emissions into banks’ decision making when providing loans to shipping companies. The initiative highlights how businesses are having to respond to moves by investors around the world to factor environment, social and governance (ESG) risk into their commercial strategy. International shipping accounts for 2.2% of global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and the U.N.’s International Maritime Organization (IMO), has a long-term goal to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 50% from 2008 levels by 2050. “As the IMO progresses its agenda, we will look to adapt our policies for shipping in line with that and the evolution of the Poseidon Principles,” Parker told Reuters. Citi is one of the world’s major shipping finance banks with a lending portfolio of around $11 billion. “As chairman Michael will remain actively involved in senior client relationships and overall strategy as well as Citi’s sustainability and ESG agenda with the industry given his role as chairman of the drafting committee of the Poseidon Principles,” Citi said in a statement. “This is a planned transition as a consequence of Michael stepping up to a full-time role as chairman EMEA Corporate Banking for Citi.” Shreyas Chipalkatty, currently the division’s head of EMEA, will take on Parker’s previous role as global industry head of Citi’s shipping & logistics business."
17.98649188655244," Citigroup, BNP caught up in U.S. case against Huawei CFO: documents NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S.-based Citigroup Inc and French bank BNP Paribas are caught up in the U.S. criminal case against the chief financial officer of China’s Huawei Technologies, according to newly available documents. The banks were named in documents released on Tuesday after a hearing in British Columbia Supreme Court, where Huawei CFO Meng Wanzhou is fighting extradition to the United States on bank fraud charges. The two are among at least four financial institutions that had banking relationships with Huawei when Meng and others allegedly misled them about its business dealings in Iran despite U.S. sanctions. Two others, HSBC Holdings Plc and Standard Chartered, have been previously reported. The banks are considered “victim” institutions in the 13-count indictment the United States brought against Meng and Huawei, which includes charges of bank and wire fraud, violating sanctions against Iran and obstructing justice. Both she and Huawei have denied wrongdoing. Spokespeople for Citigroup, BNP Paribas, Standard Chartered, and HSBC all declined to comment, as did a spokesman for U.S. prosecutors. Huawei did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the newly public information. The British Columbia court made public hundreds of pages of documents and other materials, including video of Meng’s detention, in advance of a hearing scheduled to begin Sept. 23 in Vancouver. Meng, the daughter of Huawei’s billionaire founder Ren Zhengfei, was arrested at Vancouver’s airport in December on a U.S. warrant and her lawyers argue she was unlawfully detained. They claim Canadian authorities delayed her arrest to allow the border patrol to gather evidence for the United States as part of a “covert criminal investigation.” In the video, Meng can be seen moving through the Vancouver airport customs and immigration area, escorted by border agents, and being questioned. In a transcript, Meng repeatedly asks why she was being detained and is eventually told she can contact a lawyer, but not her family. “My family members will be worried if they can’t find me,” she says. Meng was searched and interrogated for hours in violation of her constitutional rights, her lawyers say. She spent more than a week in detention before being granted bail. Diplomatic relations between Canada and China turned icy after Meng was detained and China subsequently arrested two Canadian citizens, charging them with espionage. It has also blocked imports of some Canadian commodities. Meng and Huawei also have become part of the escalating U.S. and China trade war. U.S. President Donald Trump told Reuters in December he would intervene in her case if it would help secure a deal with China, leading her lawyers to argue the extradition proceedings are being used for economic and political purposes. In Tuesday’s court documents, they describe Trump’s comments about Meng as “corrosive of the rule of law.” The United States also has made a broader push against Huawei, the world’s largest telecommunications maker, which it maintains is involved in activities contrary to U.S. national security or foreign policy interests. Huawei was placed on a U.S. trade blacklist in May that bans the sale of U.S. parts and components to the company without special licenses. So far, the licenses have not been granted except to allow the repair and maintenance of existing products and networks. Besides alleged sanctions-busting, the United States says the company’s smartphones and network equipment could be used by China to spy on Americans, allegations the company also has repeatedly denied. In one document released on Tuesday, the United States describes the evidence against Meng, including articles published by Reuters in 2012 and 2013 about a company in Iran called Skycom Tech that had tried to sell computer equipment from a U.S. firm to a customer in Iran. The reporting detailed links between Huawei and Skycom, including that Meng had served on Skycom’s board of directors between February 2008 and April 2009. The articles were “concerning” to at least four financial institutions that banked for Huawei, according to the document, which was drafted by a U.S. federal prosecutor in Brooklyn, New York, where the case was brought against Meng and Huawei. U.S. laws and regulations generally prohibited the banks from providing U.S. dollar transactions tied to Iran through the United States. Meng and others defrauded HSBC and other banks by misrepresenting Huawei’s relationship with Skycom, according to U.S. prosecutors who claim Skycom’s operations in Iran were controlled by Huawei from at least 2007 until 2014. U.S. authorities claim Huawei used Skycom to obtain embargoed U.S. goods, technology and services in Iran, and to move money via the international banking system. According to the newly available document about the evidence, witnesses for the prosecution of the U.S. case will include executives from HSBC, Standard Chartered and Citigroup, and an FBI forensic accountant is expected to testify about documents showing BNP Paribas provided banking services for Huawei between at least 2013 and 2018. In February, when Reuters exclusively reported that HSBC conducted a probe that helped bring the case against Meng and Huawei, a spokesman said the bank was legally obligated to provide the information it did to the U.S. Department of Justice. All four banks have resolved their own sanctions issues with U.S. authorities in recent years. The agreements range from BNP Paribas paying $8.9 billion in 2014 and pleading guilty in U.S. court to Citigroup agreeing to pay $217,841 the same year over potential civil liability for its apparent violations of sanctions programs."

22.197986224594434," More major banks bet on steeper Australian rate cuts as trade risks rise SYDNEY (Reuters) - Commonwealth Bank, HSBC and Citi are betting that Australia’s central bank will cut interest rates more steeply than previously thought as global trade tensions ratchet up and domestic hiring intentions slow. Economists at CBA CBA.AX, Australia's biggest bank by market capitalization, said in a note on Thursday they expect one 25 basis point (bps) easing in November followed by a second in February, taking the key rate AUCBIR=RIC to 0.5%. Earlier, they had predicted just one cut to 0.75%. HSBC and Citi followed up with a similar predictions of two cuts. HSBC had expected the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) to halt its current easing cycle after two back-to-back reductions in June and July to a record low of 1%. Citi had earlier forecast another easing to 0.75%. With the RBA pledging to do more if needed, the revised expectations from these banks now match financial market pricing <0#YIB:>. “There has been further escalation in the trade and technology tensions between the U.S. and China, which is now having a more distinct impact on currency markets too,” HSBC chief economist Paul Bloxham said in a note. “We expect the local labor market and global downside risks to motivate the RBA to cut further,” Bloxham added. The clear and present danger to the economy prompted RBA Deputy Governor Guy Debelle to warn of the growing risks from the trade war. In a speech on Thursday, Debelle said a slowdown in business investment decision risked a self-fulfilling global downturn. HSBC’s change in view was led by an abrupt escalation in the trade war this month when U.S. President Donald Trump slapped tariffs on $300 billion of Chinese imports. That led to a sharp depreciation in the yuan, prompting Washington to label China a “currency manipulator.” The rising tensions have heightened fears that a significant economic slowdown in China would severely hurt Australia’s growth as the two economies are closely intertwined. Further raising concerns about domestic momentum, official data on Thursday showed Australia’s jobless rate was stuck at a disappointingly high 5.2% in July even as employment surged past expectations. “The leading indicators of the labor market are pointing to reasonable jobs growth. But they are running at a level that suggests progress in reducing labor market slack will stall,” CBA’s economics team wrote. Australia’s economy has dodged a recession since the early 1990s thanks to insatiable appetite from China for its key commodities but growth has now slowed to the weakest since the global financial crisis. The protracted Sino-U.S. trade war has fueled fears of a global recession, hammering financial markets overnight and pulling yields on 10-year Treasuries below those on two-year paper. That inversion of the curve has been a reliable predictor of recessions in the past. Financial markets are pricing in policy easing by all major central banks. “The global backdrop looks more risky,” Citi economist Josh Williamson said. “The domestic economy requires more policy accommodation.”"
14.869810672665839," Medina Mora, powerful Citigroup exec who battled scandals, dies at 69 MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Manuel Medina Mora, one of the most influential Mexican bankers to work on Wall Street during a long career at Citigroup Inc C.N, has died, the bank's Mexican unit Citibanamex said on Wednesday. He was 69. Citibanamex said Medina Mora died of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a form of motor neuron disease. Earlier, the bank had said multiple sclerosis was the cause of death. Medina Mora was a powerful executive at what became Citi’s most important foreign unit, credited with turning a laggard Mexican lender into a lifeboat for the large U.S. bank as it rebounded from the 2007-2009 financial crisis. However, money laundering and loan fraud scandals at the Mexican unit tarnished his legacy, even as he managed to keep a hold on power and run the bank at arm’s length from New York. Citi bought the lender, known as Banamex, in 2001 and the unit came to account for about 15% of the parent company’s global consumer revenue by 2016, when Medina Mora resigned. Medina Mora was the third generation in his family to work at Banamex, according to prominent businessman Alfredo Harp Helu, and had the nickname “Mr. Mexico” within Citigroup. In 2016, the Mexican subsidiary was renamed Citibanamex. Citigroup Chief Executive Officer Mike Corbat paid tribute to Medina Mora, saying he had been a “mentor to many” and helped turn the business into one global franchise. “Manuel was a pillar of Mexico’s business community yet his impact extended well beyond his home country,” Corbat said in a statement, expressing his sadness at Medina Mora’s passing. Seen as an effective manager who smartly navigated internal affairs, Medina Mora was described by powerbrokers who knew him as a brilliant and respected banker. Under his leadership, Banamex, one of the oldest Mexican banks in continuous operation, became Mexico’s second-largest bank with more than $26 billion in deposits and over 1,000 branches. However, a series of scandals damaged his reputation, leading to a significant pay cut in 2014, and likely contributed to his retirement in 2016. In 2014, loans made to a Mexican company backed by bogus work orders from state oil firm Petroleos Mexicanos [PEMX.UL], or Pemex, cost Citi more than $500 million.

17.21196932714497," Medina Mora, powerful Citigroup exec who battled scandals, dies at 69 MEXICO CITY, Aug 7 (Reuters) - Manuel Medina Mora, one of the most influential Mexican bankers to work on Wall Street during a long career at Citigroup Inc, has died due to multiple sclerosis, the bank’s Mexican unit Citibanamex said on Wednesday. He was 69. Medina Mora was a powerful executive at what became Citi’s most important foreign unit, credited with turning a laggard Mexican lender into a lifeboat for the large U.S. bank as it rebounded from the 2007-2009 financial crisis. However, money laundering and loan fraud scandals at the Mexican unit tarnished his legacy, even as he managed to keep a hold on power and run the bank at arm’s length from New York. Citi bought the lender, known as Banamex, in 2001 and the unit came to account for about 15% of the parent company’s global consumer revenue by 2016, when Medina Mora resigned. Medina Mora had been the third generation in his family to work at Banamex, according to prominent businessman Alfredo Harp Helu, and had the nickname “Mr. Mexico” within Citigroup. In 2016, the Mexican subsidiary was renamed Citibanamex. Seen as an effective manager who smartly navigated internal affairs, Medina Mora was described by powerbrokers who knew him as a brilliant and respected banker. Under his leadership, Banamex, one of the oldest Mexican banks in continuous operation, became Mexico’s second-largest bank with more than $26 billion in deposits and over 1,000 branches. However, a series of scandals damaged his reputation, leading to a significant pay cut in 2014, and likely contributed to his retirement in 2016. In 2014, loans made to a Mexican company backed by bogus work orders from state oil firm Petróleos Mexicanos, or Pemex, cost Citi more than $500 million. In addition, anti-money laundering issues and soured loans created hundreds of millions of dollars in losses. Medina Mora started as an intern at the bank in 1971, working his way up to lead the privatization of Banamex in 1991. He became chief executive of the resulting Banamex-Accival Financial Group in 1996, before eventually running Citi in Latin America in 2004 and heading its global consumer banking business in 2010.

The New-York based bank will also lay off hundreds of equity and fixed-income traders globally in response to weak revenue trends, according to a Bloomberg report that cited sources familiar with the matter. A Citi spokesman declined to comment on the reported layoffs. The new unit, named Equities and Securities Services, will be co-led by Dan Keegan, Okan Pekin and Murray Roos. Keegan will also become head of markets and securities services for North America. “As the industry continues to consolidate and margin pressures intensify, clients are looking for solutions that deliver best-in-class services,” co-heads of markets and securities services Carey Lathrop and Andy Morton wrote in an internal email seen by Reuters. “We believe that now is the time to create an integrated offering supporting the pre-trade, execution and post-trade requirements of our clients,” they wrote. The combined business will include broad trading and execution capabilities in addition to financing, hedging, clearing, and custody services, the memo said. In its second-quarter results reported earlier this month, Citi’s trading revenue remained challenged for a third consecutive quarter, with fixed-income trading down 4%, excluding a gain from Citi’s investment in Tradeweb, and equities revenue down 9%. Many other banks already have combined such units. Citi’s markets and securities services division has been shaken up in recent months as the bank streamlines businesses to better serve the evolving needs to clients.

-1.8192730465814493," Citi ramps up ASEAN banking team with 30 hires over past year SINGAPORE, July 16 (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc said it has hired about 30 bankers over the past year across its banking, capital markets and advisory teams in the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), spurred by robust growth in its ASEAN banking business. Countries in the bloc such as Vietnam and Thailand are benefiting from the ongoing Sino-U.S. trade war as companies start to shift supply chains to Southeast Asia to escape tit-for-tat tariffs that the world’s two biggest economies are imposing on each other’s goods and services. “We are seeing growth across local ASEAN companies increasingly going global,” David Biller, head of Citigroup’s ASEAN banking, capital markets and advisory team, said in a statement on Tuesday. “On the inbound, global multinational companies are increasingly investing in ASEAN and the supply chain shift through many ASEAN countries is leading to increased opportunities for Citi’s ASEAN banking network,” said Singapore-based Biller. The hires include bankers in Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam and Malaysia – some of Citigroup’s fastest-growing markets in the Asia-Pacific region. On Monday, Citigroup topped expectations for quarterly profit as a tight lid on costs and strength in consumer lending helped it counter weakness in its trading business. However, corporate lending was 9% lower than the year-earlier period and Citigroup’s chief financial officer told reporters that the bank’s loans to corporate clients in Asia were down about 5%, partly because of aggressive pricing by competitors, but also because of “some of the trade tensions”. Citigroup’s revenue from supporting clients in intra-Asian trade corridors rose 18% in the first half. As economic growth slows in developed economies, global banks are stepping up their presence in Southeast Asia, attracted by strong regional trade flows. Over the past year, Citi advised LafargeHolcim Ltd on the sale of businesses in Indonesia and Philippines and was a joint global co-ordinator for Vinhomes JSC’s $1.35 billion share issue in May 2018."
0.06333746553261602," S&P ends near flat as Citigroup results sink banks; Nasdaq hits new high NEW YORK (Reuters) - The benchmark S&P 500 index ended little changed on Monday after oscillating between positive and negative territory throughout the session after Citigroup Inc C.N kicked off the earnings season with a mixed quarterly report. The bank reported a better-than-expected profit but also a decline in its net interest margin. The fall in net interest margin triggered a fall in shares of other banks on concerns that it would presage lower profits across the industry as interest rates have dropped. Though Citigroup shares erased nearly all their losses to end just 0.1% lower, the S&P 500 bank index .SPXBK slid 1.0%. Shares of JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N and Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N - all set to report results on Tuesday - declined more than 1%. As a result, financial shares .SPSY fell 0.5% to weigh most heavily on the S&P 500 among its 11 major sectors. Gains in technology .SPLRCT and healthcare .SPXHC shares offset the losses in financial shares, however. Those sectors helped the Nasdaq edge higher to notch its fourth consecutive record closing high. Second-quarter earnings start in earnest this week, and analysts expect S&P 500 companies to report a 0.3% fall in profit, which would be the first quarterly drop in three years, according to Refinitiv IBES data. U.S. stocks will likely be muted until more results come in, said Oliver Pursche, chief market strategist at Bruderman Asset Management in New York. The three main indexes ended last week at record closing highs as dovish comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell bolstered hopes the central bank would cut interest rates later this month. “It’s definitely a wait-and-see environment,” Pursche said. “Citi was looked at as slightly disappointing.” Yet solid earnings could give U.S. stocks a further boost, said Lamar Villere, portfolio manager of the Villere Balanced Fund in New Orleans. “We think earnings are going to be generally positive this season,” he said. “We’ve been on a tear this year, but we still have some room to go.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI rose 27.13 points, or 0.1%, to 27,359.16, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 0.53 point, or 0.02%, to 3,014.3 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 14.04 points, or 0.17%, to 8,258.19.

0.06333746553261602," Citigroup profit beats estimates on gains in consumer lending (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc topped expectations for quarterly profit on Monday as a tight lid on costs and strength in consumer lending helped the third-largest U.S. bank counter weakness in its trading business. New York-based Citi is the first major bank to report second-quarter earnings. Fellow Wall Street titans JPMorgan Chase & Co, Bank of America Corp and Goldman Sachs Group Inc report later in the week. Bank stocks have lagged the market in recent weeks on concerns that net interest margins, a key measure of bank profitability, have peaked as the Fed gets ready to start cutting interest rates. Citi’s interest margin declined slightly to 2.67% from 2.70% a year earlier and 2.72% in the first quarter of 2019. But the bank was able to make more money from its lending activities during the quarter and net interest income rose 2%. Overall revenue rose 2% to $18.76 billion, driven by 4% growth in Citi’s consumer business as customers spent more on their credit cards. Branded card revenue jumped 7% as more customers initially attracted with promotional offers started paying interest. Interest-earning card balances rose 10%. Strength in its consumer sector helped offset softness in Citi’s Wall Street business and corporate banking. Trading revenue remained challenged for a third consecutive quarter. Fixed-income trading fell 4%, excluding a gain from Citi’s investment in Tradeweb, while equities revenue declined 9%. Corporate lending was 9% lower than the year-ago period. Citigroup Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason told reporters on a call that trade tensions have discouraged some corporate customers from taking out loans. “There’s a bit of caution that many of the corporate clients are exercising, in particularly in Asia,” Mason said. He said Citigroup’s loans to corporate clients in Asia were down about 5%, partly because of aggressive pricing by competitors, but also because of “some of the trade tensions.” Overall, Citi continued to add loans and deposits in the most recent quarter, allaying concerns that a weaker economic outlook was hurting consumers’ ability to borrow. Firmwide loans rose 3% to $689 billion, while deposits increased 5%, excluding foreign exchange fluctuations. Banks have been under pressure to cut costs as a weaker economic outlook raised concerns about revenue growth. Mason said earlier this year the bank has accelerated some cost-cutting plans to cope with potential headwinds. Expenses fell 2% during the quarter, putting the bank on track to end the year on the high end of its projected $500 million to $600 million in annual savings, Mason said on a call with analysts. Return on tangible common equity, one of the broadest measures of performance, improved more than one percentage point to 11.9%, putting Citi in striking distance of its 12% ROTCE goal for the year. Citi’s per-share earnings have been propped up by a lower outstanding share count due to large stock buy-back programs, but investors have been pressuring the bank to prove it can grow profit organically. Its share count declined 10% in the second quarter from a year earlier. The stock ended little changed on Monday, off 6 cents, or 0.08%, at $71.71. Net income rose to $4.80 billion, or $1.95 per share, in the second quarter, from $4.50 billion, or $1.63 per share, a year earlier. Excluding the impact of a one-time gain related to Citi’s investment in electronic trading company Tradeweb. the bank earned $1.83 a share. Analysts had expected a profit of $1.80 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

0.06333746553261602," U.S. Fed seen launching repo facility in early 2020: Deutsche Bank (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve may launch a policy tool to lend to banks using Treasuries and other securities as collateral in early 2020, with possible testing to begin later this year, a Deutsche Bank strategist said. Such a standing fixed-rate repurchase agreement, or repo, facility would serve as a backstop against sharp spikes in interest rates in money markets, which are occurring with growing frequency at month- and quarter-end. “We reaffirm our expectations that the Fed could test this facility later this year and launch it for full-scale operations in early 2020,” Deutsche Bank strategist Steven Zeng wrote in a research note published late on Friday. Fed policymakers debated the merit of a repo facility in June. There is no consensus yet on the design of the facility. Other Wall Street analysts questioned whether a repo facility would happen any time soon when the central bank may end its balance sheet normalization and restart its purchases of Treasuries sooner than it has planned. “Our base case remains for this facility to be implemented eventually, but we think it can take longer than we previously expected – around Q3 2020 – given diverse opinions on the parameters from the participants,” Citi Research rates strategist Steve Kang wrote in a research note. Still, the Fed and financial markets stand to benefit from a repo facility, Deutsche Bank’s Zeng said. For the Fed, such a program could shrink more of its balance sheet, currently at $3.86 trillion, and may discourage big banks from hoarding reserves, resulting in more even distribution of reserves to smaller banks, he said. For traders and investors, a repo facility could support Treasuries trading volumes and liquidity by offering more flexibility to banks to move between holding reserves and holding securities, he said. Big U.S. banks have clung to a large share of excess reserves, rather than lending them, partly to meet liquidity requirements enacted in response to the global financial crisis a decade ago. More bank demand for Treasuries could help lower bond dealer holdings of them. Dealers’ need for financing to hold their Treasuries inventory has contributed to the intermittent spikes in repo rates on the open market, he said. The Fed may initially set the facility’s fixed rate at 35 basis points above the interest the Fed pays on bank reserves. The spread could be adjusted up or down, Zeng said. He reckoned the Fed would allow banks and primary dealers, or the top 24 Wall Street bond firms that do business directly with the Fed, to access the repo facility."
-5.0630138125709125," ANZ, Citi and Deutsche cartel case heads for 'bigger courtroom' in Australia SYDNEY (Reuters) - A criminal cartel case against Australia and New Zealand Banking Group ANZ.AX and the local units of Citigroup C.N and Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE was adjourned on Tuesday for further legal arguments ahead of a possible trial. Australian authorities filed charges last year against the firms and six senior bankers over the sale of A$3 billion ($2.1 billion) in ANZ shares in 2015 and subsequent trading by the underwriters. The case is being closely followed by brokers and banks around the globe because it could have major implications for the underwriting business and lead to increased scrutiny from regulators worldwide. It was standing room only as lawyers crammed into a tiny courtroom in Sydney for the brief procedural hearing, setting dates in September when lawyers for the banks and bankers will press to be allowed to cross-examine prosecution witnesses. “We’re going to need a bigger courtroom,” Magistrate Jennifer Atkinson said, before fixing the case for its next mention on Sept. 3 and two days of arguments on Sept. 25 and 27. None of the accused executives were present and it is not clear if or when the matter will proceed to trial. Prosecution lawyer Shanaka Jayasuriya said in court that he would oppose his witnesses being cross examined, without elaborating. The government accuses the banks of forming a criminal cartel to either “directly or indirectly” restrict the supply of ANZ shares or maintain the price of ANZ shares, according to court documents. The banks and bankers are all defending the charges. ANZ did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on Tuesday. Citigroup had no commend but has previously said it had “operated successfully in Australia in this manner for decades”. Deutsche referred to a previous statement saying it will vigorously defend the charges and its staff. JPMorgan JPM.N, which underwrote the capital raising along with Citigroup and Deutsche Bank, has not been charged. A representative declined to comment. If convicted, the companies could face penalties of up to A$10 million or triple the benefit of the conduct. The individuals charged could face 10 years in jail. ANZ, Australia’s third-largest bank, is also facing civil charges over the same share issue by the country’s corporate watchdog, though that case was paused in June pending the outcome of the criminal matter."

-5.226952039669241," Deutsche Bank held talks with Citi, BNP on shedding chunk of equities business: Wall Street Journal (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE has held talks with Citigroup Inc C.N, BNP Paribas SA BNPP.PA and others over the possible sale of parts of its equities business, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday. Deutsche Chief Executive Officer Christian Sewing said in May that he planned to make cutbacks to the bank’s investment banking and trading operations to appease investors unhappy about its underperformance. Shares in the German lender hit a record low last month. Sources told Reuters last month that Deutsche plans to cut the size of its U.S. equities business, leaving only a skeleton operation to service corporate and high-net-worth clients. The business has struggled to compete with Wall Street rivals. Deutsche Bank, Citigroup and BNP Paribas declined to comment. Reuters reported in May that Deutsche’s prime brokerage services, which serves hedge funds, would be a key focus of the cutbacks. Deutsche is also planning to set up a separate unit, or “bad bank,” to house toxic assets worth up to 50 billion euros ($56 billion). Deutsche Bank’s supervisory board is expected to meet on July 7 to finalize its plans. The unit is expected to hold mainly long-dated derivatives, sources familiar with the matter say. Those assets have been a burden on the bank’s capital position since tougher rules were introduced after the 2007-09 financial crisis. Deutsche wants to wind down the assets or sell them. However, it may struggle to find other banks willing to take them on, analysts say, though they say private equity buyers could be interested in taking them at a deep discount. “I think it’s possible buyers could emerge but Deutsche would have to take a mighty big write-down,” said David Hendler, an independent analyst at New York-based Viola Risk Advisors. The discussions could involve Deutsche employees moving to one or more other banks alongside client balances, systems and derivative positions, some held by Deutsche Bank to offset bets taken by its clients, the WSJ reported, citing people familiar with the matter. No agreements have been reached in the talks involving multiple parties, the report said."

2.2657322878897523," Citi launches co-branded credit cards with SE Asia's Grab in push for more customers HONG KONG (Reuters) - Citigroup has teamed up with Singapore-based ride-hailing firm Grab to launch co-branded credit cards, as it looks to boost its Asian customer base by about 13% via partnerships with digital firms, a senior Citi executive said. The new cards mark the latest step in Grab’s big push into the financial services sector, an area it has earmarked for growth. For the U.S. bank, it is in line with its strategy to offer its products within online ecosystems as consumers spend more time on smartphones. The Citi-Grab co-branded cards will be issued in the Philippines on Tuesday and in Thailand later this year, before being rolled our in other Southeast Asian markets. “Today we have about 16 million customers in Asia, and our aspiration is to increase this by about two million in the next few years through partnerships alone,” Gonzalo Luchetti, Citi’s head of consumer banking for Asia Pacific, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, told Reuters. Citi launched a co-branded credit card with Indian payments firm Paytm last month and with Qantas two years ago. The bank’s net income from Asia Pacific was $4.4 billion in 2018, with a third of its $15.3 billion revenue coming from Southeast Asia - where Grab is the leading ride-hailing firm. Grab, which started as a taxi-hailing app firm, has been aggressively expanding into financial services and said, earlier this year, that it was pursuing lending licenses across Southeast Asia. “The Citi-Grab credit card is a natural next step as we create more value for our digital first, always in GrabPay users,” Huey Tyng Ooi, managing director of GrabPay Singapore, Malaysia, and the Philippines, said in a statement. Grab is also exploring spinning off its financial services unit and has mandated banks to approach potential minority investors, Reuters reported last month, citing sources. Banks and insurance firms are among the potential investors in the Grab unit, a source has said. Lenders around the world are trying to partner with digital players to get closer to consumers. A recent case in point would be Goldman Sachs’ credit card deal with Apple that can potentially connect Goldman with hundreds of millions of iPhone users. Competition is fierce, however, as banks try to work with the most successful digital players, who in return are vying with each other to get the better deal with banks. “We are not the only ones to see the blinding insight that customers are spending more time on their phones whether in payment, ride sharing or chat ecosystems, but it is all about how you execute a partnership,” Citi’s Luchetti said. “Thirty years ago, if you wanted to be relevant to clients, you needed to have as many branches as you could. Today ... people spend hours every day in these virtual cities, and the equivalent of having a branch in every corner is being able to provide your services within these digital ecosystems.” Citi has closed hundreds of branches in Asia in recent years, shrinking its network from 600 to roughly 250, while, like its competitors, spending heavily on digital initiatives. “Now we have reached a point of decent stability,” Luchetti said. “If you asked me to make a bet on how many branches we’ll have in a few years, I would say a number in the low 200s.”"

Founded in 1982, Investcorp is one of the oldest Middle Eastern private equity houses. As of the end of last year, it had $22.5 billion in assets under management. The firm has hired the banks to coordinate the refinancing of a $400 million revolving credit facility it raised in 2016 which is due next year, said the sources. Investcorp and Citi declined to comment. JPMorgan did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The new revolving loan, with a maturity of four years renewable by one year, is being syndicated to other banks, said the sources. A revolving loan is one that can be drawn, repaid and drawn again during the agreed lending period. The 2016 loan included a euro-denominated tranche of around 110 million euros, according to Eikon Refinitiv data. The refinancing comes amid a slowdown in the Middle East loan market, as borrowers have increasingly turned to bond issues to diversify their funding base and, more recently, to take advantage of favourable conditions across emerging markets.

Australian authorities filed criminal charges in June last year against Citi, Deutsche Bank, Australia and New Zealand Banking Group and six senior bankers over the sale of A$3 billion ($2.07 billion) in ANZ shares in 2015, and subsequent trading by the underwriters. Citi said Luet as chief executive officer would report to Tim Monger, interim CEO of the bank’s Asia Pacific business. He takes over the role from David Livingstone, who was recently named CEO for Citi’s Europe, Middle East & Africa region. “Marc has a strong record in leading complex businesses across multiple segments and geographies,” Livingstone said.

-5.192057401024008," Citigroup looks to vastly expand India reach with Paytm tie-up MUMBAI (Reuters) - India’s top digital payments firm Paytm on Tuesday launched a credit card with Citigroup, widening its financial product base while giving its banking partner an opportunity to vastly expand its credit card customer base in the country. The new card should help Paytm stay a step ahead of rivals in the fiercely competitive digital payments market in India where companies from Alphabet Inc-owned Google to Walmart-owned PhonePe, are all scrambling to grab a piece of the digital payments pie that is projected to grow to $500 billion by 2020, according to the Boston Consulting Group. For Citi, it is a big opportunity to extend its retail presence in India. Even if only 1% of Paytm’s over 300 million customers use the new credit card, that’s a huge number, Stephen Bird, Chief Executive, Global Consumer Banking at Citi told reporters at a news conference. “We think there is a tremendous potential for growth of this partnership,” Bird added. Paytm became a household name across India after New Delhi’s shock move to ban high-value currency notes late in 2016 led to a cash crunch and boosted use of its electronic wallet. Its parent One97 Communications counts Japan’s SoftBank Group, Alibaba and Berkshire Hathaway among its investors. The Paytm First Card will offer 1 percent cashback on all transactions, unlike reward points offered by most rival credit cards in India. “We understood that there is a set of the customer base or customer needs that get fulfilled when you have a credit card or card in the hand,” said Vijay Shekhar Sharma, founder and CEO of One97 Communications. “That is why we had launched a debit card of our bank and today we complete our offering with a credit card partnership with Citibank.” Sharma, a self-made billionaire, said his firm is targeting “urban aspirational users who are first-time credit users”.

-5.200886755827454," Citi closes CitiCross 'dark pool' amid equities unit review NEW YORK (Reuters) - A unit of Citigroup Inc has shut down one of its private stock trading venues, often referred to as dark pools, as part of a broader review of the bank’s equities business, the bank said on Monday. Citigroup Global Markets’ CitiCross alternative trading system (ATS) ceased operations on April 30, according to a filing from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. “We have decided to shut down the CitiCross ATS as part of a strategic review of our equities business. We continue to invest in talent and technology to drive wallet share growth in global equities,” Citi spokesman Scott Helfman said in a statement. Last month Citi reported a 24 percent drop in equities trading revenue in the first quarter due in part to lower market volumes, pressuring the bank’s overall revenue. Nearly 25 million shares were matched in CitiCross during the week of April 15, placing it 23rd out of 32 active U.S. ATSs in terms of size, according to the most recent statistics from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. The average trade size was under 200 shares. Dark pools are electronic broker-run trading venues, and every big bank has one. They allow investors to trade shares without the trading data becoming available until after the trades happen, reducing the chance that others in the market will catch wind of the buyer’s or seller’s intentions and move the price against them. The private trading venues have traditionally been more lightly regulated than public stock exchanges like those run by Nasdaq Inc and New York Stock Exchange-owner Intercontinental Exchange Inc, but in recent years regulatory scrutiny and compliance costs have increased. Citi still operates a block trading ATS called CitiBLOC, according to the SEC filing. That ATS matched just over 6.4 million shares with an average trade size of more than 15,000 shares in the week of April 15, according to FINRA."
