17.18658034137729," Reliance's unit to sell Marcellus shale assets for $250 million BENGALURU (Reuters) - Reliance Industries Ltd said on Thursday its unit will sell its interest in certain upstream assets in the Marcellus shale in the United States for $250 million in cash to Northern Oil and Gas Inc. The assets, currently operated by various affiliates of EQT Corp, will be sold for the cash consideration and warrants, that will allow for the purchase of 3.25 million common shares of NOG at an exercise price of $14 per common share over the next seven years, Reliance said. In 2017 Reliance sold a shale oil and gas block in the Marcellus shale in northeastern and central Pennsylvania for $126 million. Reliance, led by billionaire Mukesh Ambani, has been diversifying away from its mainstay energy arm to consumer-facing businesses in recent years."
14.715090795241073," Sweden's EQT to buy real estate investment firm Exeter for $1.87 billion STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden’s EQT said on Tuesday it had signed a deal to buy global real estate investment manager Exeter Property Group for $1.87 billion as the buyout group reported an almost doubling in net profit for 2020. EQT said the acquisition fitted well with its plan to expand its real estate operations, particularly in North America where the firm aims to strengthen its position. Exeter, majority-owned by Ward Fitzgerald and other members of Exeter’s management team, has more than $10 billion of assets under management, EQT said in a statement. “We’ve found a perfect match in that they are similar to us in terms of growth, financial profile and underlying culture,” EQT Chief Executive Christian Sinding said on a conference call with analysts. “Real estate is a market we see as quite attractive, growth has been strong and we expect that to continue,” he added. EQT shares were up just over 10% at 0840 GMT. Pennsylvania-based Exeter is focused on acquiring, developing and managing commercial and residential properties mainly across the United States and Europe. The consideration for the acquisition consists of $800 million in new EQT shares and $1.07 billion in cash. Exeter is expected to generate around $135 million in revenues for 2020, EQT said. “The transaction supports EQT’s diversification across asset classes as well as provides a stronger footprint in the U.S.,” Citi analysts said in a note. EQT also reported an annual net profit of 283 million euros ($343.17 million) compared to 149 million a year ago, beating a mean forecast of 230 million euros in a Refinitiv poll of analysts. It proposed a dividend of 2.40 Swedish crowns per share paid in two equal instalments in June and December. Assets under management grew by 46% to 52.5 billion euros, a record year for the firm in terms of fund raising."

EQT said the deal to buy 29.6% of shares and 26.4% of votes would make it the largest shareholder in Beijer Ref. “EQT will support Beijer Ref’s growth journey, which will include acquisitions and organic expansion, as well as investments in digitalization and automation initiatives,” the private equity group said. The deal would give Carrier, which had sold shares worth about $300 million in the company in September, cash to cut its debt and fund growth initiatives, the U.S-based company said in a statement late on Monday. Beijer Ref made an operating profit of 780 million crowns ($92.9 million) in the January-September period, on sales of 10.65 billion crowns. Citigroup Global Markets acted as a financial adviser to Carrier on the deal, which is expected to close by the end of December.

Following the carve-out from Bilfinger, Apleona has sold activities such as the turnkey construction business in Germany and its UK-based real estate advisory business GVA. Bilfinger is set to benefit from the sale as a result of an earn-out clause in the 2016 deal, which provided equity-like participation rights.

SUSE, acquired two years ago by Swedish investment fund EQT from Micro Focus International for $2.5 billion, has been a target of media speculation that it is planning an initial public offering of shares. And, while CEO Melissa Di Donato declined to comment on the IPO talk, she did tell Reuters that SUSE was positioned for rapid growth as enterprises seek greater flexibility in running software on premise, in the cloud or in hybrid settings. “Customers depend on us to be able to innovate with speed, adaptability and agility,” the American veteran of SAP , Salesforce, IBM and Oracle, said in an interview. SUSE, founded in 1992, is working with companies including Walgreens on the U.S. pharmacy chain’s largest S/4 HANA retail environment on the Microsoft Azure cloud. The Linux specialist has just completed its own acquisition of Rancher Labs, a leader in Kubernetes, an open-source system for managing ‘containerised’ tasks that can run automatically in different settings. The Rancher deal was valued at $600 million, according to reports when it was announced in July. SUSE said revenue exceeded $450 million in the fiscal year to Oct. 31, with both the top line and profit growing in double digits. Revenue was up from a reported $320 million in 2017, the year before the company was acquired by EQT. The annual contract value of bookings worth more than $1 million grew by 21% in its fiscal fourth quarter, while cloud bookings jumped by 87%, the company said.

21.625344352617084," Buyout fund EQT in early takeover talks with KPN: source LONDON/AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - European private equity fund EQT is holding preliminary talks with KPN NV KPN.AS over a possible takeover bid that could value the largest Dutch telecommunications company at about $13 billion, a source with knowledge of the matter said. EQT has approached both KPN’s management and the Dutch government in recent weeks to discuss a possible deal, the source said. The buyout fund, founded in Sweden in 1994 and led by Chief Executive Christian Sinding, is working with JPMorgan JPM.N on a possible deal, the source said, but negotiations are still at an early stage and no deal is certain. KPN's top investor America Movil AMXL.MX, which owns 16% of the Dutch firm, has not been informed of the discussions, which were first reported by Bloomberg, the source added. EQT and KPN declined to comment while America Movil was not immediately available. KPN shares rose almost 6.5% on Thursday to 2.64 euros. On October 28, KPN boss Joost Farwerck told reporters during the company’s third-quarter results that KPN was not planning on being bought but remained open to interest. “If somebody comes along with an interesting proposal, we can always listen, but we’re not focused on it,” he said. KPN, which has a market value of 11 billion euros, competes with VodafoneZiggo and T-Mobile in the highly concentrated Dutch market and has suffered a decade-long decline in sales. Farwerck has said he does not expect a quick revival. EQT owns the Netherlands’ second-largest fibre optic network, DeltaFiber, and may use it as a vehicle to buy parts of KPN’s fibre business and extract some synergies, or cost efficiencies, if an outright takeover fails to win the blessing of Dutch government officials, the source said. In May, the Dutch government passed a law that allows it to block takeovers of companies in the telecommunications sector that it deems to be not in the interest of national security. “Any deal for KPN needs to be friendly. EQT will never go hostile,” the source said. The Netherlands’ Economic Affairs ministry, which oversees KPN, did not respond to requests for comment on Thursday. An attempt to buy KPN for 8 euros per share in 2013, by America Movil, floundered on KPN’s poison pill defences, which are still in place."

The deal includes about 100 work-in-progress wells, acreage in the Marcellus basin and a 31% stake in Laurel Mountain Midstream, a joint venture between Chevron, producer Laurel Mountain and pipeline operator Williams Cos Inc WMB.N. EQT’s shares fell nearly 4% in after-market trading after it launched an offering of 20 million shares to partially fund the deal alongside cash and borrowings. The deal comes at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic has slashed energy demand, sent oil prices to historic lows earlier this year and forced producers to cut costs, curtail production and seek consolidation to weather a downturn. Reuters reported last month that EQT had placed a bid on Chevron’s Appalachia gas properties and a pipeline stake. Chevron last year said it was considering a sale of the properties and took an $8.17 billion charge to earnings to write down their value and an unrelated U.S. offshore project.

Oil and gas producers have been forced to cut costs and curtail production in hopes for higher prices in the future as the COVID-19 pandemic has slashed energy demand. EQT, which began production curtailment in September, said it began to bring back production on-line from early October and all curtailed production had been returned to sales. The Pittsburgh-based company on Thursday also cut its full-year capital expenditure forecast by $50 million at midpoint to a range of $1.05 billion and $1.1 billion. It raised the bottom end of its full year adjusted core earnings guidance by $50 million to a range of $1.55 billion to $1.6 billion. The company now expects full-year sales volumes of between 1.48 billion cubic feet equivalent (bcfe) and 1.5 bcfe, slightly higher than its previous range of 1.45 bcfe to 1.5 bcfe. Sales volumes in the quarter ended Sept. 30 fell about 4% to 366 bcfe, with about 15 billion cubic feet curtailed. Average realized prices fell 5.7% to $2.33/Mcfe.

Bloomberg on Friday reported that European private equity firm EQT was considering a potential bid for KPN. The buyout firm was said to be in early discussions with possible advisers on the feasibility of a deal, without any final decision having been made. KPN and EQT declined to comment on the report. Shares in KPN traded up 7.5% at 0805 GMT in Amsterdam, reaching their highest level in three months. KPN shares had lost 15% since the start of the year until Friday. KBC Securities analysts on Monday said a deal could make sense considering EQT’s ownership of fiberglass supplier Delta Fiber, which has the second-largest fiber footprint in the Netherlands after KPN. A deal could be opposed by the company and Dutch government. A new law adopted this year gives the government the option to block takeovers of Dutch telecom companies if they are deemed a threat to national security. KPN also has a strong defence against unwanted takeovers, in the form of a foundation that can build up a controlling stake to block any deal. This proved successful in 2013, when KPN won a lengthy battle against unsolicited interest from Mexico’s America Movil . (Reporting by Bart Meijer; Editing by Edmund Blair)"

Chevron last year said it was considering sale of the properties and took an $8.17 billion charge to earnings to write down their value and an unrelated U.S. offshore project. Most of the impairment charge was for the gas properties.

Bids for the properties were received on Aug. 12 and are being evaluated, Chevron said in response to inquiries. It declined to comment on the bids. There is no guarantee the talks will lead to a sale to EQT or another company. The shale assets are from Chevron’s purchase of producer Atlas Energy for $4.3 billion including debt in 2010, a time when shale gas fields were selling at large premiums. A year earlier, Exxon Mobil Corp. agreed to pay $30 billion for XTO Energy, then a large Appalachian shale basin operator. The deals soured for both companies.

Equitrans said it was recently made aware that EQT believed the pipeline was not in service, and that gave the producer the right to terminate gathering agreements with Equitrans and take ownership of the line in exchange for a reimbursement. EQT, the largest U.S. natural gas producer, was even marketing the pipeline for a sale with its financial advisors under that belief, an action Equitrans said it believes “constitutes unlawful conduct”. Equitrans said that the 1.6 Bcf/day Hammerhead pipeline was, however, placed in-service on Aug. 1, after being completed and injected with initial line-pack - gas stored in a pipeline - provided by EQT in July 2020. “We firmly believe, and have communicated to EQT, that EQT lacks any valid basis for its actions and that any attempt by EQT to terminate the Hammerhead gathering agreement and to acquire (or potentially sell) the Hammerhead pipeline is contrary to law,” Equitrans said in a statement. EQT in 2018 split into two, separating its midstream operations from the gas production business. It did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

EQT, which bought a 60% stake in Getec in 2016, is expected to hire advisors in the first quarter of 2021 and to start an auction targeted at utilities and infrastructure investors shortly thereafter, they said, adding a deal could be worth several billion euros. EQT declined to comment. Madgeburg-based Getec is a producer of decentralized energy, supplying heat and electricity to industrial and real estate clients such as shopping malls. Cash-rich investors seeking stable returns have turned to infrastructure assets this year as the sector has proven resilient during the coronavirus pandemic. Despite the low prices, oil-related infrastructure deals have also been high in demand as seen in Abu Dhabi National Oil Company’s pipeline deal in June. Getec has annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of 150 million-200 million euros ($179 million-$238 million), the sources said.

EQT expects the purchase of Madrid-based Idealista, which is controlled by funds advised by private equity firm Apax Partners, to close in December, pending regulatory approvals. Spain’s mergers and acquisitions market has been ignited by a series of deals within banking and telecoms, such as the tie-up between Bankia and Caixabank and the recent purchase of MasMovil by a group of funds. Investment bankers are expecting more deals to surface in Spain in both the short and medium term. Spain’s real estate market has hit a difficult period, with stagnating prices in cities because of the coronavirus crisis and rising demand in rural areas as many Spaniards seek to avoid another urban lockdown. Despite this, Idealista has experienced record growth in the months since the pandemic began, saying that its traffic is up to unprecedented levels, while noting buyer enthusiasm is tempered by a tougher financing climate. Idealista, which supports around 40,000 real estate agents and receives an average 38 million unique monthly visitors, has launched a mobile app and tripled its revenue since it was bought by Apax in 2015. “The business... is now a clear market leader in Spain and Portugal, and a strong player in Italy,” Tom Hall, a partner at Apax, said.

The fund level subscription credit facility currently totals €2.3bn and has an upper limit of around €5bn. It is the first ESG-linked fund bridge facility of this size in the global fund financing markets, EQT said. “This is a game changing moment for EQT but also the private equity industry, further evidencing how our industry also can benefit from sustainable financing,” Per Franzen, partner and co-head of the EQT Private Equity Advisory Team. “For us, ESG plays a crucial role in how EQT future-proofs companies and with an ESG-linked bridge facility, we bring a new dimension to EQT’s value creation process.” The financing has a pricing mechanism designed to incentivise portfolio companies in improving their ESG performance, specifically in terms of gender equality on the board of directors; renewable energy transition; and sustainability governance. The mechanism is directly tied to EQT’s higher level targets on diversity and climate as well as its governance model. The financing is being provided by syndicate of global financial institutions including BNP Paribas and SEB as sustainability coordinators and BNP Paribas as facility agent and sustainability agent. EQT and future portfolio companies will work with advisers to develop customised and measurable key performance indicators for the individual companies, which will be reported quarterly and audited annually. This approach will contribute to an increase of reliable and comparable ESG data. “With this ESG-linked financing facility, we actively contribute to increasing the availability of high-quality ESG data, critical for the financial markets to be able to build a resilient and regenerative economy,” Therese Lennehag, head of sustainability at EQT, said. The aggregated results from the portfolio companies’ ESG efforts will later be compared with the pre-set KPI targets. The portfolio’s averaged fulfilment rate will impact the ESG-bridge facility’s interest rate, with an improved ESG performance meaning lower pricing.

The group said in April that the pandemic and economic ructions could slow fundraising and delay asset sales, but is nonetheless looking at potential French deals. “We’re starting to work on a few items that should materialise by year-end or next year, and which we think will be able to move ahead,” said Nicolas Brugere, a former partner at France’s PAI who will now run EQT’s French office. The Swedish firm, which will also focus on real estate in France, plans to expand the 10-strong team, Brugere told Reuters. EQT - with about 40 billion euros ($45 billion) in assets under management globally - invests heavily in infrastructure, including assets such as fibre-optic internet, hospitals and clean energy firms. Its private equity operations also focus additionally on areas such as software.

Revenues are expected to be impacted as carry is dependent on exits and increases in unrealized values,” EQT Chief Executive Christian Sinding said in the report. EQT said investments by its funds had totalled 1.8 billion euros ($1.94 billion) in the first quarter and that its portfolio of assets, while impacted by the pandemic, remained “relatively robust.” “Furthermore, based on our experience from previous crises, the portfolio companies have prepared for a potential downturn and even though the magnitude of COVID-19 was unpredictable, having contingency plans in place is helping the companies respond faster,” it said. EQT has raised more than 62 billion euros in capital since it opened for business 25 years ago. It currently has about 40 billion euros in assets under management across 19 funds.

163.38289962825277," EQT Corp sells half its stake in pipeline operator, strikes rate relief deal (Reuters) - EQT Corp EQT.N said on Thursday it renegotiated its gas transportation rates and sold half its stake in pipeline company Equitrans Midstream Corp ETRN.N as the largest U.S. natural gas producer tries to cope with low fuel prices. U.S. natural gas prices are trading at their lowest in nearly two decades, hurting producers, many of whom have disclosed asset writedowns in the last few months. EQT recorded $1.6 billion non-cash impairment charge in the fourth quarter. Shares of EQT were down 3.3% at $4.79 amid a broader 4% drop in the S&P Energy index .SPNY. The Pittsburgh-based company has been looking to sell assets to pay down debt and said on Thursday that it had refined its hedging strategy and cut annual capital expenditure. The company expects 2020 capital expenditure between $1.15 billion and $1.25 billion, compared with a prior outlook of between $1.25 billion and $1.35 billion. It has hedged 87% for 2020 and 26% for 2021, assuming flat production. The company, which focuses on production from the Marcellus and Utica shale basins in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia, said it expects 2020 sales volumes in the range of 1,450-1,500 billion cubic feet equivalent (bcfe). But it could curtail production if commodity prices fail to give returns, Chief Financial Officer David Khani said on the post-earnings call. The company said under the new gas gathering agreement with EQM Midstream Partners LP EQM.N, EQT will get a gathering and compression fee relief and increase its minimum volume commitments, effective upon the Mountain Valley Pipeline kicking into service. In addition, EQT also exchanged half of its equity stake in Equitrans Midstream for a combination of $52 million in cash and incremental fee relief. These deals are expected to give EQT about $535 million in total fee relief over a three-year period, starting 2021, and cost savings that would improve its EBITDA and leverage. “The announced rate reduction should provide meaningful rate relief but puts a higher burden on executing asset monetization plans to fund upcoming 2021 maturities,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Scott Hanold. EQT also reported a 5.2% fall in fourth-quarter sales volumes and posted a smaller-than-expected loss. Excluding items, the company posted a loss of 3 cents per share, smaller than analysts’ average estimate of 21 cents, according to Refinitiv IBES."

159.2026791755741," UPDATE 1-EQT, OMERS to buy Deutsche Glasfaser, increasing competition in fibre-optic rollout (Adds valuation, EQT quote) FRANKFURT, Feb 10 (Reuters) - Investors EQT and OMERS have agreed to buy German fibre-optic network company Deutsche Glasfaser from buyout firm KKR, increasing pressure on incumbents Deutsche Telekom and Vodafone to roll out high-speed internet access more widely. EQT Infrastructure last year acquired peer Inexio and is now planning to merge that company with Deutsche Glasfaser. EQT will hold 51% in the combined group and OMERS Infrastructure 49%, the two investors said on Monday. The deal, in which EQT beat rival investment firms Antin and Brookfield, values Deutsche Glasfaser at more than 2.5 billion euros ($2.74 billion), including debt, people close to the matter said. Over the coming years the combined group plans to invest more than 7 billion in the roll-out of high-speed internet infrastructure in rural Germany. Deutsche Glasfaser, set up by Dutch investor Reggeborgh in 2011 and previously backed by KKR, has a broad national focus and has invested around 1 billion euros in its network since 2011. It provides high-speed internet access to more than 600,000 households and 5,000 businesses through 30,000 kilometers of fiber-optic infrastructure. “Deutsche Glasfaser and Inexio currently connect a combined 250,000 homes a year to fibre-optic grids and we are planning to double that in the medium term”, EQT partner Matthias Fackler said. Independent fibre-optic companies have built franchises in German regions and cities, seeking to capitalise on government efforts to build a national network and achieve ‘gigabit’ speeds. Both Inexio and Deutsche Glasfaser were put up for sale last summer and suitors had contemplated a combination of both from the beginning. Deutsche Glasfaser has annual earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation of more than 100 million euros, according to a person familiar with the matter. The rollout of 5G mobile involves erecting cells connected by fibre-optic to main mobile masts - enabling rapid downloads and shortening reaction times so that, for example, self-driving cars can navigate city streets safely. At around 7% of households, fibre-optic penetration is lower in Germany than in countries like the Netherlands, creating pressure on Europe’s largest exporter to speed up its rollout to remain competitive. Innexio and Deutsche Glasfaser have been building fibre-to-the-home connections in underserved parts of Germany, creating de facto local monopolies. OMERS has also invested in French fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) firm SFR FttH, which last year bought peer Covage.

140.19809889825675," UPDATE 1-EQT discusses postponing flotation of visa firm VFS on virus impact -sources (Updates with details, background) FRANKFURT/ZURICH Feb 5 (Reuters) - Buyout group EQT is discussing postponing the planned stock market flotation of its visa services firm VFS on fears that the spread of the coronavirus could impact the deal, people close to the matter said. While EQT had planned to launch the flotation next month it is considering postponing the deal to May, the people said, adding that no final decision had been taken. EQT and VFS declined to comment. “Investors are worried because it is not clear how deep the dip in first-quarter performance will be,” one of the sources said. The deliberations on the timing of the initial public offering come after Germany’s Atotech last week decided to postpone its float, concerned that the coronavirus outbreak would negatively impact valuation. A second person said that while the base case remained a first-quarter launch of the IPO, the timing of the deal would be reconsidered if the situation does not improve in coming weeks. “It’s premature to say that the VFS IPO will be pushed back as the company has a very limited presence in China,” a third person added. While China was an important market for VFS, travellers from other Asian countries were hardly affected so far, the second person said, adding that most Chinese travelled in the summer months and not in the first quarter. Dubai-headquartered VFS is a provider of visa process outsourcing services for governments and diplomatic missions worldwide. It supplies security checks, information dissemination and form checks for visa applicants, as well as the recording of biometric data and identity verification. EQT bought Swiss travel group Kuoni in 2016 and split it into three businesses. VFS, in which Kuoni and the Hugentobler Foundation have stakes, has made a series of acquisitions since then. The listing could value VFS at more than 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.08 billion), another of the sources said. Last year, EQT tried to sell the company but shelved the deal after offers came in too low.. It opted for an IPO instead, which is being organised by Credit Suisse, Citi and UBS, according to people familiar with the matter. The company, which competes with France’s TLScontact operates in 147 countries and processes visa applications for governments in around 3,400 sites.

142.53506493506492," Exclusive: Gas producer EQT seeks to raise $1 billion from royalty deal - sources (Reuters) - EQT Corp, the largest natural gas producer in the United States, is aiming to raise as much as $1 billion by selling some of its royalty income, people familiar with the matter said on Friday. EQT has been seeking ways to reduce its swelling debt pile of close to $5 billion as it struggles to cope with lower natural gas prices. Late last year, it tried unsuccessfully to divest its Ohio acreage, two of the sources said. EQT is in talks to find an investor for a so-called “override” deal, the sources said. The investor would take a 1% royalty interest in the net revenue generated from EQT’s production, the sources added, requesting anonymity because the matter is confidential. The sources cautioned there was no certainty a deal would be reached. In 2018, EQT generated operating revenue of $4.7 billion, following its $6.7 billion acquisition of peer Rice Energy. Its production is focused on the Appalachian Basin. A spokesman for EQT declined to comment. More U.S. natural gas producers are turning to override deals to raise cash as falling gas prices make it more difficult to sell assets at attractive valuations. Fellow Appalachian producer Range Resources Corp completed two override deals in the second half of 2019. EQT said when announcing its third-quarter earnings it wanted to raise $1.5 billion from asset sales by mid-2020 to pay down debt, maintain its investment-grade credit rating, and better equip itself to operate in a lower commodity price environment. Earlier this month though, Moody’s Investors Service Inc downgraded EQT’s credit rating from Baa3 to Ba1, citing the unlikely prospect of improvement in the company’s cash flow metrics to a level required to support an investment-grade credit profile. EQT’s 2020 capital budget indicates a more constrained approach to reserves and production growth, enabling the company to generate free cash flow that could be applied toward debt reduction, Moody’s added."
49.355183327780075," EQT Corp to take up to $1.8 bln charge as U.S. gas prices at two-decade lows Jan 13 (Reuters) - U.S. natural gas producer EQT Corp said on Monday it would take a non-cash impairment charge of up to $1.8 billion in its fourth quarter, as it writes down the value of some assets due to lower commodity prices, sending shares down 6%. U.S. natural gas prices are trading at near two-decade lows due to oversupply. That forced oil major Chevron Corp to warn in December that it would have to write down up to $11 billion in the fourth quarter, mainly due to losses at its shale gas operation in Appalachia. Smaller rival Range Resources had warned a week earlier that it expects to take a significant charge. EQT said in a filing here it plans to cut debt by about 30%, or about $1.5 billion, by mid-2020 as oil and gas companies face investor pressure to focus more on higher returns and debt reduction by cutting back on spending. The company said it expects to spend $50 million less in 2020 compared to its prior outlook and estimated capital expenditure to be between $1.25 billion and $1.35 billion. It now expects net sales volumes to be between 370 billion cubic feet equivalent (bcfe) and 375 bcfe in the fourth quarter, at the high end of its prior forecast of between 355 bcfe and 375 bcfe.

The offer price represents a premium of 9.7% to Metlifecare’s closing price on Dec. 20, before its stock was placed on a trading halt, and a 38% premium to the closing price prior to the announcement of the initial offer on Nov. 19. EQT first approached Metlifecare with an offer of NZ$6.50 per share, which was rejected. Further discussions led to the raised offer, Metlifecare said. The board backed the deal, adding that it had received strong support from a number of institutional shareholders. In a separate statement, EQT said it had also entered into a voting deed with Metlifecare’s largest shareholder, New Zealand Superannuation Fund Nominees Limited (NZSF), to vote in favor of the deal. NZSF holds about 19.9% of the New Zealand company’s shares. The fund manager said a few other Metlifecare shareholders collectively representing around 22% of the register had also indicated their intention to vote for the deal.

VFS, formerly part of travel group Kuoni, had attracted offers from private equity investors such Partners Group, Cinven, CVC, Permira, PAI and Onex. “It was the right decision to wait because EQT was unable to get the price it had imagined,” one person following the deal closely said.

-43.51117404732548," EQT to cut spending on U.S. natural gas production in 2019, 2020 (Reuters) - EQT Corp EQT.N, the biggest U.S. natural gas producer, said on Thursday it cut its capital expenditure guidance for 2019 and 2020 as new management highlighted their plans to deal with low energy prices. EQT cut its expected 2019 capex by $115 million and reduced its planned 2020 spending forecast by $525 million from its prior 2019 guidance. Despite the cut in 2019 capex, the company said in its third quarter earnings release that it was maintaining its 2019 full-year production guidance of 1,490-1,510 billion cubic feet equivalent (bcfe). The company, which focuses on production from the Marcellus and Utica shale basins in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia, said it expects sales volumes in 2020 of 1,450-1,500 bcfe, which is roughly flat with projected 2019 output. “We are committed to allocating our capital responsibly and effectively, with the intent to reduce absolute debt by at least $1.5 billion by mid-year 2020 to maintain investment grade metrics,” EQT President and Chief Executive Toby Rice said in the earnings release. Rice, who took over as head of EQT in July following a proxy battle, said the company expects to reduce well costs, overhead, land and other capex by 25% relative to legacy costs. The equity market likes EQT’s plan. Shares in EQT, which fell to a 17-year low last week, were up 8.6% to $10.75 a share in midday trade on Thursday. EQT said it planned to spend $1.30-$1.40 billion in 2020. That compares with its previous capital expenditure expectation of $1.825-$1.925 billion in 2019. That previous expectation was before the $115 million reduction announced on Thursday. EQT is not the only driller cutting spending to focus on earnings as it copes with an expected decline in energy prices. U.S. financial services firm Cowen & Co said projections from the exploration and production (E&P) companies it tracks point to a 5% decline in capex for drilling and completions in 2019 versus 2018. Before EQT reported its earnings, Cowen said nine of the 47 E&Ps it tracks reported spending estimates for 2020 with just two increases and seven decreases versus 2019. EQT said 87% of its 2020 gas production is hedged at a weighted average floor price of $2.71 per dekatherm, which is equivalent to $2.71 per million British thermal units (mmBtu). Analysts project gas prices at the Henry Hub NG-W-HH-SNL benchmark in Louisiana will average $2.76 per mmBtu in 2019 and $2.65 in 2020. That compares with an average of $3.16 in 2018 and a five-year (2014-2018) average of $3.13. [NGAS/POLL]"

EQT is expected to mandate an investment bank as advisor on the sale by year end or early next year and may start an auction in the first quarter, the people said, adding that no final decision on an exit had been made. The investor, which bought the company at a valuation of 1.4 billion euros ($1.6 billion) in 2016, is expected to shop Apleona to other private equity firms as well as peers such as CBRE CBRE.N, Cushman & Wakefield CWK.N and Jones Lang Lasalle (JLL) JLL.N, they added. EQT declined to comment. Apleona employs roughly 20,000 staff in 30 countries and has annual sales of 2 billion euros. It counts BMW, Volkswagen, Daimler, BASF, Adidas, Siemens and Lufthansa among its clients. This year, Apleona is expected to post earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of 120 million euros, with substantial growth expected next year, one of the people said. EQT is hoping to fetch at least the earnings multiple of 11 times it paid in the 2016 transaction. CBRE, Cushman & Wakefield and JLL trade at between 7 and 9.5 times expected EBITDA but may be willing to buy a company at a higher valuation to expand their facility management services, which supplies a steady revenue flow albeit at lower margins compared to their more volatile project management services, one of the people said. Following the carve-out from Bilfinger, Apleona has sold activities such as the turnkey construction business in Germany and its UK-based real estate advisory business GVA. Bilfinger is set to benefit from any sale as a result of an earn-out clause in the 2016 deal, which among other provided equity-like participation rights. “This entitles Bilfinger to 49 percent of the resale proceeds, less debt, from EQT,” Bilfinger said in its 2016 annual report.

EQT plans to sell around 20 percent of its shares at 62-68 Swedish krona ($6.44-$7.06) each in the maiden listing, according to a lead manager, raising between 1.2 billion-1.3 billion euros.

The IPO will fund continued investments in the business and growth opportunities, including expansion in North America and Asia-Pacific, the company said in a statement. The deal will consist of a mixture of new shares -- that will raise about 501-550 million euros equivalent for the firm -- and existing shares sold by the owners.

Shareholders ranging from mutual fund group T. Rowe Price Group Inc to pension fund CalSTRS elected all seven Rice Team nominees as directors as well as five nominees supported by both Rice and EQT, the company said in a statement. “The newly constituted Board will meet later today and is expected to name Toby Z. Rice as President and CEO, succeeding Robert McNally,” the statement added. The vote ended an eight-month campaign against the EQT board and management during which the Rice brothers claimed they had mismanaged the company since the brothers sold them natural gas and oil firm Rice Energy in 2017. The board is also expected to name John McCartney, a former board member of Rice Energy, as its chairman, a person familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. Robert McNally, who will be replaced as CEO, at times choked back tears while conducting the annual meeting in Pittsburgh on Wednesday, according to a person who was in the room. It was one of the biggest fights for corporate board control since Starboard Value won its proxy contest at Darden Restaurants Inc in 2014. Toby and Derek Rice have been frustrated with operations at EQT and decided their only recourse was to press ahead with a proxy battle and for Toby Rice to replace McNally as chief executive officer. While a number of prominent shareholders had publicly declared their support for the Rice team early, proxy fights are often decided when the large index funds that own large stakes vote. BlackRock and State Street both sided with the dissidents, having voted late Tuesday, according to a person familiar with the voting. Vanguard was the only large shareholder to use the universal proxy card, picking several people off the Rice slate and voting for others from the EQT slate, the source said. Toby Rice told Reuters last month that he needed more influence on the board to make changes such as cutting costs and bringing in new executives to run key business after EQT let most of Rice Energy’s senior management go after the merger. EQT energy shares rose 2.3% at $16.02 early Wednesday. The stock price has tumbled nearly 59% since the Rice merger was completed, sparking worry among big investors and at least one influential proxy advisory firm."

Enough votes have been cast for the Rice brothers to defeat EQT’s slate of directors and take over the board in what has become the most prominent fight for control of a board since Starboard Value waged and won its proxy contest at Darden Restaurants Inc in 2014, the sources said. Two sources said that the pair is expected to have won seven seats on the 12-member board. Representatives for EQT and the Rice brothers did not immediately respond to requests for comment. At stake is control of the largest natural gas producer in the United States. The Rice group has waged an eight-month campaign against the current EQT board and management, claiming they have mismanaged the company since its 2017 takeover of Rice Energy. Investors can vote until EQT’s annual meeting begins in Pittsburgh at 8 a.m. on Wednesday. But with big investors ranging from T.Rowe Price to the California Teachers Retirement System pension fund having already thrown their support to the brothers, sources say their win is all but assured. Toby and Derek Rice, two of the three brothers who sold Rice Energy to EQT in 2017, have been frustrated with operations at EQT and decided their only recourse was to press ahead with a proxy contest and plans to push for Toby to replace Robert McNally as EQT’s chief executive officer. Toby Rice told Reuters last month that he needs more influence on the board to create changes like cutting costs and bringing in new executives for key parts of the business after EQT let most of Rice Energy’s senior management go after the merger. EQT’s stock price tumbled nearly 59% since the Rice merger was completed, sparking worry among big investors and at least one influential proxy advisory firm. Besides T.Rowe Price, investors D.E. Shaw and Kensico Capital Management as well as Elliott Management have publicly said they are backing the brothers, giving them more than 21% of the vote. CalSTRS, whose votes often carry clout with other investors, reported on its website that it cast its vote for the brothers’ slate and for five current board members who were unopposed. Similarly proxy advisory group Institutional Shareholder Services threw its weight behind the Rice group.

-25.811045069187866," Rice Energy founder says EQT's turnaround dependent on his board takeover plan NEW YORK (Reuters) - The founder of Rice Energy, the U.S. natural gas producer acquired by larger peer EQT Corp for $6.7 billion in 2017, told Reuters on Tuesday that only by giving him control of the EQT board would the business be able to make the changes he believes it needs. Toby Rice has put forward himself, his brother Daniel and five more nominees to sit on EQT’s 12-member board, arguing the company has mismanaged the acquisition, with its inefficient production methods leading to significant shareholder value destruction. Daniel Rice is already an EQT board director. EQT shareholders will decide on the composition of the board in a vote at the company’s annual shareholder meeting on July 10. “We’ve tried having a voice with just a couple of board seats, and that hasn’t worked, so clearly we need more influence on this business to effect the change that needs to happen,” Toby Rice told Reuters in an interview. EQT has said the company is improving across its financial parameters, as highlighted by its most recent earnings, and that the Rice challenge is based on inflated projections and outdated market conditions. Shares of EQT have lost around half their value since its Rice Energy acquisition in November 2017. Toby Rice said much of EQT’s woes stem from current management ignoring Rice Energy’s best practices for drilling wells and utilizing technology in the production process, as well as discarding most of Rice Energy’s senior management in the wake of the merger. The consequence, according to Rice, has been significant inefficiencies and the highest production costs for EQT among Appalachian producers - a charge which EQT has denied. The Rice team would bring in its own executives in key parts of the business, such as drilling and completions, technology, and human resources. The rest of the EQT management team would be subject to a “fair assessment” of their capabilities, Rice said. “That being said, because we have experience in building our business from the ground up, I know what the right leadership looks like and what are the right things we need to be focused on,” said Rice, who aims to take over as chief executive. The Rice team is backed by EQT’s fourth-largest shareholder, DE Shaw Group. Rice said the departure last month of DE Shaw’s head of activism, Quentin Koffey, had not impacted the investment firm’s support.

-42.8575529401614," Sweden's EQT cuts the cord on $2.3 billion offer for Aussie telco Vocus (Reuters) - Vocus Group Ltd on Tuesday said Swedish private equity firm EQT Infrastructure had withdrawn its A$3.3 billion ($2.30 billion) buyout offer, making it the fourth suitor to drop its bid for the telecoms company in the last two years. “Following an accelerated period of due diligence, EQT has decided not to proceed with the transaction outlined in the indicative proposal,” Vocus said in a statement. A spokeswoman for EQT declined to comment on the development. The withdrawal comes just a few days after Australian energy retailer AGL Energy Ltd revealed it had made and then ditched a takeover offer for Vocus as it could not agree on due diligence terms with the telecoms firm. U.S. buyout firm KKR & Co Inc and Asian peer Affinity Equity Partners had pursued and then abandoned their own plays for Vocus in 2017 after a string of profit warnings from the telco. Australia’s fourth-biggest internet provider had issued several profit warnings, lost its chief executive and had to scrap the sale of its New Zealand arm, as competition in recent years had cut its profit margin. Competition in the industry has also prompted TPG Telecom Ltd and the local arm of Britain’s Vodafone Group PLC to pursue a A$15 billion merger. After struggling over the past two years, Vocus appeared to be poised for a second wind, with the company pursuing forays into fiber-optic infrastructure over its traditional internet services. The company had in 2018 separated the enterprise and wholesale arm of its Australia business into two operating segments. The move into fiber optics would have also aligned the company with EQT, which seeks equity investment in medium-sized infrastructure companies, according to its website. EQT’s offer, which at the time was at a 35% premium to Vocus’ previous closing share price, had come just as Vocus’ turnaround plan was beginning to gain traction. The company had allowed EQT to conduct non-exclusive due diligence. Vocus on Tuesday also reiterated its fiscal 2019 underlying core earnings forecast range of A$350 million to A$370 million."

-47.861244060900304," Australian telco Vocus entertains $2.3 billion offer from Sweden's EQT BANGALORE/SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian telecoms junior Vocus Group Ltd on Monday said it received a A$3.3 billion ($2.3 billion) buyout offer from Swedish private-equity firm EQT Infrastructure, just as the firm’s fiber-focused turnaround plan begins to gain traction. The non-binding offer sent Vocus shares soaring by a quarter and vaulting over where they traded in 2017 when U.S. buyout firm KKR & Co Inc and Affinity Equity Partners made, then abandoned, their own plays for the struggling telco. EQT made a cash offer of A$5.25, Vocus said. That was a 35% premium to Friday’s closing price and A$1.1 billion bigger than KKR and Affinity’s separate but matching bids, underscoring confidence in the telco’s path away from discount retailing into network building. “It’s a great price,” said independent telecoms analyst Paul Budde. “Vocus has been struggling a bit for the last couple of years (but) the assets that they have are definitely worthwhile.” “(The bid) is not necessarily for the business or the customers that they have ... but that infrastructure is always something that is worthwhile and they have got quite a lot of it.” Vocus, in a stock exchange filing, said its board has allowed EQT to conduct non-exclusive due diligence. It gave no view on the offer. EQT was not immediately available for comment. Shares of the telco jumped as much as 26 percent after the announcement, hitting a two-and-a-half-year high before drifting lower to A$4.59 - still well below the offer price, suggesting a degree of doubt about whether a deal will materialize. The broader market was flat. Sydney-based Vocus, Australia’s fourth-largest internet provider, fell into a downward spiral in 2017 and 2018, cutting and missing profit forecasts as its retail businesses battled falling profit margins and increasingly stiff competition. The same forces are driving competitors TPG Telecom Ltd and the local arm of Britain’s Vodafone Group PLC to pursue a A$15 billion merger. Both KKR and Affinity dropped their approaches for Vocus, without explanation, four days after Vocus issued a third profit warning in nine months back in August 2017. Since then, Vocus has shifted focus to network infrastructure, owning and developing fiber-optic cables in Australia, New Zealand and the Pacific. Under the strategy, revenue in the division grew by almost a third over the six months to Dec. 31. “Where the retail market is still very tough, trying to fight against the big guys, that infrastructure-based commercial business seems to have a few different dynamics,” said Jason Beddow, chief executive officer of A$5.3 billion fund manager Argo Investments Ltd and a shareholder of Vocus. EQT, which is backed by Sweden’s industrialist Wallenberg family, has mostly focused in Europe and North America. In 2014, it bought Australian medical diagnostics firm I-Med, selling out in 2018 for A$1.25 billion. Beddow said it was too early to comment on EQT’s Vocus proposal because it was not binding. Vocus said it expects the due diligence process to take weeks and that a formal, binding, bid may follow. ($1 = 1.4428 Australian dollars)"

-38.319943005931876," Rice Energy founder to drop lawsuit against energy producer EQT (Reuters) - Toby Rice, the co-founder of Rice Energy, which was acquired by EQT Corp in 2017, said in a statement on Sunday he would drop his lawsuit against EQT after the U.S. oil and gas producer said it was not seeking to manipulate the outcome of his board challenge. Rice and his brother Derek have put forward a slate of nominees to challenge EQT’s board in a shareholder vote in July, arguing EQT has mismanaged the $6.7 billion acquisition of their company to the detriment of EQT investors. In a lawsuit last month, Rice also accused EQT of seeking to mislead its shareholders by portraying his board nominees as endorsing EQT’s existing board, and presenting their election as triggering covenants that would require EQT to repay early or refinance its debt. In a letter on Sunday to its management, EQT said the lawsuit was a distraction without merit, calling it “a tactic intended to distract focus from the company’s strong first quarter financial results and outstanding recent operational performance.” EQT said the Rice team had misinterpreted a “standard form director and officer questionnaire” and that it would not seek to conflate its board directors with the Rice nominees. It added it had no intention of triggering change of control provisions that would have required a debt refinancing or early repayment. In response, the Rice team said in its statement it was pleased “EQT has conceded that it must withdraw its unreasonable requirements” and that it was “deeply disappointed” that a lawsuit was needed to address the issue. The Rice team is continuing with its effort to overthrow EQT’s board. Pittsburgh-based EQT became one of the largest gas-focused U.S. producers when it completed its tie-up with Rice Energy.

-26.382220516993875," EQT Corp CEO rejects Rice Energy board manipulation lawsuit (Reuters) - The chief executive of EQT Corp has rejected allegations in a lawsuit filed on Thursday by a founder of Rice Energy Inc to prevent the oil and gas producer from “manipulating” the outcome of its forthcoming board election. Toby and his brother Derek Rice were part of the founding team of Rice Energy, which was bought by EQT in November 2017. They are pushing for a change in EQT’s strategy and replacement of its board. Toby, in a statement, alleged that EQT might name Rice nominees in its proxy statement against their wishes, giving an impression that his nominees support the company’s current board. Warring parties commonly send separate proxy cards, he added. “We believe both sides agreeing to use a universal proxy card would reflect best-in-class corporate governance, as the most qualified directors would be elected regardless of which proxy card a shareholder voted on,” said Toby Rice. The Rice brothers had nominated nine candidates to the EQT board, which currently has 12 directors. In an interview with Reuters, EQT CEO Rob McNally insisted there was no attempt by the board of the company to manipulate the nomination process, and said it would file its preliminary proxy material in the “next few weeks.” “This is something timed to distract the market from a good set of results from the company,” McNally said, referring to EQT’s first-quarter earnings released earlier on Thursday. EQT’s shares were trading 2.1% lower at mid-afternoon. Despite becoming the largest U.S. natural gas producer when it acquired Rice Energy, shares of Pittsburgh-based EQT have underperformed. The Rice brothers blame EQT management for not fulfilling the Appalachian-focused firm’s potential, while the company has insisted the duo’s projections are inflated and based on outdated market conditions. Shares of EQT have lost 42% of their value since its Rice Energy acquisition in November 2017, while the broader S&P 500 Energy index has declined only about 3% in the same period."

9.164049546288899," Exclusive: Sweden's EQT may sell 1 billion euro stake in Stockholm IPO - sources STOCKHOLM/FRANKFURT (Reuters) - EQT, the largest private equity firm in the Nordic region, is planning a Stockholm listing that could take place in the third quarter with the aim of raising about 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion), three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. A stake of about 25 percent could be sold in an initial public offering (IPO), potentially valuing EQT at about 4 billion euros (41.7 billion Swedish crowns), the sources told Reuters, declining to be named because the plans were private. The company has previously said it was considering options to strengthen its balance sheet but it had not indicated whether this would involve an IPO and has not indicated a specific timing, the stake to be offered or any potential valuation. Marcus Brennecke, partner and co-head of EQT’s advisory team, said on Wednesday that EQT had hired JP Morgan and SEB to assist with a possible IPO or “something else” this year if the market environment was right. He did not give further details. The first source told Reuters that a listing of EQT could be in the second quarter “if all stars align” but was more likely to be in the third quarter. He said no final decision had been taken on an IPO and all options were still open. Despite investor concerns about a U.S.-Chinese trade row and Brexit, another source said EQT was still drawing interest because of its involvement in a range of industries and broad geographic presence, with offices in Europe, the United States and Asia. The trade row and concerns about whether Britain will leave the European Union with a deal on its future relations with the bloc have hit other private equity firms in recent months, so an IPO by EQT will be watched closely. Listed private equity funds are relatively rare in Europe, with the majority in the United States, where firms such as Blackstone, KKR and Carlyle have been able to diversify and style themselves as alternative asset managers."

Appalachian-focused EQT acquired rival Rice Energy for $6.7 billion, making it the largest natural gas producer in the United States. However, its share price has tumbled more than 30 percent since the merger, which brothers Toby and Derek Rice blame on operational and managerial mismanagement. In a presentation to shareholders on Tuesday, the brothers proposed appointing Toby Rice, former chief operating officer of Rice Energy, as the company’s new chief executive. When EQT released its 2019 guidance in January, the brothers said they would challenge the board in a shareholder ballot. The brothers, who own around 3 percent of EQT, said in their presentation they could improve EQT’s free cash flow by $500 million per year. They proposed streamlining aspects of the organization, digitizing workflows, and improving planning to reduce well costs. A spokeswoman for EQT said on Tuesday the company disagreed with the analysis put forward by the Rices and that the firm looked forward to continued discussions with shareholders. “EQT remains focused on reducing costs and generating substantial free cash flow to create further value for EQT shareholders,” she added. Shares of EQT were down 2.4 percent to $19.31 in afternoon trading on Tuesday and are off 28 percent in the past 52 weeks. EQT’s average Marcellus well cost for a 12,000-foot lateral was $1,250 per foot in 2018, while Rice Energy, before its merger with EQT, averaged $790 per foot for wells with laterals reaching 8,800 feet in the same region, according to the Rice presentation. The brothers also said EQT has “erroneously adjusted downwards” its well costs. In a presentation, the brothers said operations could be improved by altering well designs to include more sand, water and stages per foot. The presentation also said they had initiated dialogue with EQT to improve its business, but claimed those suggestions have been ignored, prompting it to bring their concerns to shareholders.

5.4673590455531595," EQT Corp's 2019 plan draws formal Rice brothers' challenge (Reuters) - EQT Corp’s production guidance for 2019 and a plan for increased focus on generating cash flow drew a rebuke from founders of the company it merged with 15 months ago, who said they would challenge the energy firm’s board in an upcoming shareholder ballot. Pittsburgh-based EQT became one of the largest gas-focused U.S. producers when it completed its tie-up with Rice Energy in November 2017. Despite its new scale, EQT’s share price has lagged since the merger - a situation which spurred in December two of Rice Energy’s founders, Toby and Derek Rice, to call for changes. In response, EQT said it would focus on generating free cash flow that could be returned to shareholders, with EQT Chief Executive Robert McNally telling Reuters it was “highly likely” it would seek to buy back shares in the “near term.” Shareholder reaction to the plan was broadly negative, with EQT shares ending 5.5 percent lower. The sentiment was matched by the two Rice brothers, who said in a statement that EQT’s plan “does not address the fundamental concerns being raised”, and they will ask shareholders to replace board members and install Toby Rice as CEO. A spokeswoman for EQT did not respond to a request for comment on the Rice statement. However, according to a letter sent to the brothers, seen by Reuters, the EQT board said while it was “open-minded” to new ideas and adding management expertise, it questioned the “experience and suitability” of the brothers to be appointed CEO and to the board. The core schism is over how the company develops its assets: the Rice brothers insist EQT’s poor stock performance since the merger has been because the current management has not fulfilled the firm’s potential, while EQT insist the siblings’ projections are inflated and based on outdated market conditions. Under its plan, EQT expects to generate around $2.7 billion of accumulated adjusted free cash flow over the next five years. Adjusted free cash flow in 2019 was expected to be $350 million. Aiding cash flow generation would be $100 million of cost savings, an initiative to trim a further 10 percent of costs across its development program, as well as an up-to-21 percent decline in forecasted capital expenditure this year versus 2018. The company also plans to sell its 19.9 percent stake in Equitrans Midstream Corp, the pipelines business that EQT spun out in November. The Rice brothers have insisted they can generate an additional $400 million to $600 million pre-tax free cash flow per year under their plan - which has attracted the support of top-ten shareholder D. E. Shaw Group. A spokesman for D. E. Shaw did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

2.91349565853143," EQT's board to seek talks with Rice brothers: sources (Reuters) - EQT Corp’s board of directors will ask to meet Toby and Derek Rice for talks, people familiar with the matter said on Sunday, after the two brothers threatened the largest producer of natural gas in the United States with a board challenge. The Rice family sold its company Rice Energy Inc to EQT for $6.7 billion in cash and stock last year. It now owns about 2.75 percent of EQT, and Toby and Derek Rice wrote a letter last week to EQT’s board asking for a “course correction”. The brothers have also warned EQT that they will nominate their own directors to its board at its next annual shareholder meeting in 2019 if a “mutually agreeable outcome” is not reached. EQT Chairman Jim Rohr and Chief Executive Rob McNally plan to write to the Rice brothers to ask them to discuss their plans for the company in more detail with the board, the sources said, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential. EQT declined to comment, while a spokesman for the Rice brothers did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Rice brothers said in their letter last week that they had previously engaged in private discussions with Rohr and McNally to discuss their proposals, which included “inserting Toby Rice into the organization with proper authority and support to oversee operations.” They said they were going public with their demands because of what they called EQT’s lack of reciprocal engagement, as well as its pushing forward with establishing its 2019 operational plan. It is not clear how the Rice brothers will respond to EQT’s offer, and what outcome any new talks may produce. EQT shares have lost more than 45 percent of their value since the company’s acquisition of Rice Energy in November 2017, much worse than the 8 percent decline in the broader S&P 500 Energy index in the same period. The Rice brothers have said they have a “proven, detailed business plan” to generate an incremental $400 million to $600 million of pre-tax free cash flow per year above EQT’s current plans, resulting in more than $1 billion of free cash flow annually. EQT, which has a market capitalization of $4.9 billion, is focused on the acquisition, exploration and development of natural gas and oil properties in the Appalachian Basin. It has operations throughout Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio."

In a letter made public on Monday, the Rice brothers, who own about seven million shares or a 2.75 percent stake in the company, pointed to EQT’s “severely depressed” stock price and blamed the management for underperformance. EQT shares have slumped 47.6 percent as of Friday’s close since the acquisition of Rice Energy in Nov. 2017, much worse than the 7.7 percent decline in the broader S&P 500 Energy index in the same period. The two brothers said that after several EQT investors reached out to them for help, they held talks with Chairman Jim Rohr and Chief Executive Officer Rob McNally, but there was a lack of ‘reciprocal engagement’. While calling for inclusion of individuals with experience in large-scale operational planning to the board and the senior management, the two brothers also sought greater authority for Toby Rice in the company’s operations. They said they were willing to work with the board, but had already identified replacements if an agreement could not be reached and are ready with a plan that would help generate an additional $400-$600 million pre-tax free cash flow per year. EQT bought Rice Energy last year in a bid to expand its natural gas business, at a time when U.S. energy firms were spending heavily to develop facilities in gas-rich states like Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio.

The firm, founded in 1994, invests in public companies, real estate and venture capital and manages about 50 billion euros of raised capital under 27 funds. Its CEO, Thomas von Koch, wants to strengthen its balance sheet to support its global growth ambitions. Listed private equity funds are relatively rare in Europe, with the majority in the United States, where firms such as Blackstone BX.N, KKR KKR.N and Carlyle CG.O have been able to diversify and style themselves as alternative asset managers. EQT is in no hurry to finalize the banking mandate or go to the market and would “definitely not” list in the first quarter of 2019, said one of the sources, who declined to be named as the information is confidential. The company was instead considering the second or third quarter of next year, the source added. While other private equity funds have exited investments through IPOs, EQT has opted against an IPO of its portfolio firm IFS and will instead seek to refinance the enterprise software maker in early 2019 after bolstering its equity this year, a second source said. That source added that Goldman Sachs had been selected to raise 100 million euros by selling a 10-15 percent stake in IFS to one or two limited partners, a strategy EQT has applied before. The first source said this strategy was more pertinent now as private equity investors have been struggling to find good enough companies to snap up and were choosing to hold “good assets” for longer. EQT, whose companies include pest control firm Anticimex and data communications provider IP Only, is also working on raising more funds to use to bulk up its assets under management before listing, the first source added. EQT, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley declined to comment. EQT is owned by senior investment advisory professionals of EQT Partners. Investor AB INVEb.ST, founded by Sweden's wealthy Wallenberg family, is the firm's anchor investor with an ownership of about 10 percent in its most recent funds.

3.9879847070024983," EQT shares slump to eight-year low on third-quarter earnings miss (Reuters) - Shares in EQT Corp, the biggest producer of natural gas in the United States, fell to an eight-year low on Thursday after the company reported third quarter earnings that missed analyst estimates. The company reported adjusted earnings per share of 35 cents, which missed the 42 cents per share estimate, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. EQT shares dropped by more than $6, or 16 percent, to around $34 in midday trade, their lowest since 2010. By mid-afternoon, they were down 13.7 percent. Also on Thursday, the Pittsburgh-based driller announced the appointment of new directors on the completion of the separation of its upstream and midstream businesses. EQT said its earnings in the quarter were hurt by higher operating costs, including a charge related to the sale of some assets, and higher interest expense. The company also reduced guidance for the amount of gas it expects to sell in 2018 because some wells will enter service later than planned in the fourth quarter. The company said it now expects to produce 1,460-1,480 billion cubic feet equivalent (bcfe) in 2018, down from 1,520-1,550 bcfe projected in its first quarter earnings release. EQT boosted its estimated well development capital expenditures for 2018 by $300 million to $2.5 billion due to inefficiencies resulting from higher activity levels, the learning curve on ultra-long laterals and service cost increases. In addition, the company boosted its hedging for 2019 and 2020 far above the amount it hedged for 2018 and 2019 at this time last year. Just looking at swaps on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) - where EQT did most of its hedging - the company said total volume hedged was 600 billion cubic feet (bcf) at an average price of $2.99 per thousand cubic feet (mcf) in 2019 and 393 bcf at $2.98 in 2020. In the third quarter of 2017, EQT said total volume hedged using NYMEX swaps was 189 bcf at $3.18 for 2018 and just 19 bcf at $3.12 for 2019."
-19.544664481061137," EQT does not expect U.S. court order to hold up Mountain Valley natgas pipe (Reuters) - EQT Corp said Wednesday it still expects to finish the $4.6 billion Mountain Valley pipeline from West Virginia to Virginia in the fourth quarter of 2019 despite a recent decision by a federal court to vacate a federal permit for the project. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday sided with environmental groups in a dispute about a permit that allowed the company to cross rivers in West Virginia. Specifically, the court vacated the Clean Water Act Section 404 stream and wetland crossing permit, called the Nationwide 12 permit, issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. EQT said the decision affects steam and wetland crossings along about 160 miles of the pipeline route in West Virginia. EQT said in an email it was “evaluating options to understand its ability to continue with construction activities that do not include stream and wetland crossings along this portion of the route.” That court decision was only the most recent appeals court victory by the Sierra Club and other opponents of the pipeline. Due in part to those earlier court decisions, EQT in September delayed the projected in-service date to the fourth quarter of 2019 and boosted the estimated cost of the project to $4.6 billion. When it started construction of Mountain Valley in February, EQT estimated the project would cost about $3.5 billion and be completed by the end of 2018. Mountain Valley is one of several pipelines under construction to connect growing output in the Marcellus and Utica shale basins in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio with customers in other parts of the United States and Canada. The 303-mile (488-kilometer) pipeline is designed to deliver 2 billion cubic feet per day of gas to meet growing demand for the fuel for power generation and other uses in the U.S. Southeast and Mid-Atlantic. One billion cubic feet is enough gas to supply about 5 million U.S. homes for a day. Mountain Valley is owned by units of EQT, NextEra Energy Inc, Consolidated Edison Inc, AlatGas Ltd and RGC Resources Inc. EQT Midstream Partners LP will operate the pipeline and owns a significant interest in the venture."
-34.66534791476319," U.S. court vacates two permits for EQT Mountain Valley natgas pipe July 27 (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Friday vacated decisions by two federal agencies that allowed EQT Corp to build its $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion Mountain Valley natural gas pipeline from West Virginia to Virginia across federal land. The case is the latest victory in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit by the Sierra Club and other opponents of the pipeline. Analysts at Height Capital Markets in Washington said the decision could delay the project’s in-service date until the fourth quarter of 2019. The Sierra Club and others challenged decisions by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Forest Service granting the pipeline rights of way across federal land. The court concluded certain aspects of the federal agencies’ decisions failed to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act, the Mineral Leasing Act and the National Forest Management Act. Officials at EQT were not immediately available for comment. The court remanded the case back to the BLM and Forest Service for further proceedings. Mountain Valley is one of several pipelines expected to enter service over the next year or two to connect growing output in the Marcellus and Utica shale basins in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio with customers in other parts of the United States and Canada. On Thursday, EQT delayed the targeted completion date for Mountain Valley to the first quarter of 2019 from late 2018. In explaining the delay, the company cited legal challenges in the Fourth Circuit by the Sierra Club and others to a permit issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers that allowed the pipeline to cross streams and rivers in West Virginia, among other issues. The 303-mile (488-kilometer) pipeline is designed to deliver up to 2 billion cubic feet per day of gas to meet growing demand for the fuel for power generation and other uses in the U.S. Southeast and Mid-Atlantic. One billion cubic feet is enough gas to supply about five million U.S. homes for a day. Mountain Valley is owned by units of EQT, NextEra Energy Inc , Consolidated Edison Inc, AlatGas Ltd and RGC Resources Inc. EQT Midstream Partners LP will operate the pipeline and owns a significant interest in the venture. In April, the companies said they planned to spend about $350 million to $500 million to extend the pipeline about 70 miles from Virginia into North Carolina by the fourth quarter of 2020."

-14.958555819702458," KKR and Blackstone pursue stake in Swiss sports data group: sources FRANKFURT (Reuters) - KKR KKR.N and Blackstone BX.N have been picked for a second round of bidding for Sportradar, as investor EQT looks to sell a minority stake that could value the Swiss sports data group at more than 2 billion euros ($2.4 billion), sources said. The sources familiar with the matter said the second-round of bidding was due in early July, and it was unclear whether other bidders, such as rival private equity firm Permira, were also still in the running. Evercore is advising EQT on the sale. The named parties either declined to comment or were not immediately available for comment. Sportradar supplies data on live sports events and counts sports media and betting companies among its clients. In 2018 it is expected to post earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of more than 150 million euros, before costs for sports rights. Including debt, the company may be valued at 13 times that or more in a potential stake sale. EQT invested in Sportradar in 2012, and owns 37 percent in the company, while the majority of the group is still owned by founder Carsten Koerl. Since EQT’s investment, the firm has acquired peers GSS, BTD and Sportsman among others, and expanded its U.S. business via partnerships with the American Football’s NFL, basketball’s NBA, stock car racing’s NASCAR and ice hockey’s NHL. Sportradar’s U.S. advisory board features celebrity investors such as former basketball star Michael Jordan and Mark Cuban, the owner of the U.S. basketball team Dallas Mavericks. Sportradar employs 1,900 staff in 24 countries, and tracks 400,000 annual events in 40 sports. Its customers include media organizations such as AP, Kicker, NBC Sports, Google GOOGL.O and Facebook FB.O as well as betting companies such as William Hill WMH.L, Paddy Power PPB.I and Ladbrokes. Koerl and others founded Sportradar in 2007, based on a company called Market Monitor, in which Koerl had invested and which was originally set up by two Norwegian computer scientists as part of a student programming project."
