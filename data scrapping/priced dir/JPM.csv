14.510790592465906," JPMorgan puts key dealmakers in charge of SPAC unit to lure EMEA clients: memo LONDON (Reuters) - JPMorgan is deploying two of its most senior dealmakers in Europe, the Middle East and Africa to help a stream of blank cheque companies that have listed over the past year find acquisition targets in the region. The Wall Street bank is building out a so-called ‘SPAC specialist team’ which was set up in August to capitalise on the rise of blank check companies in the United States - now seen as a major driver of dealmaking activity, according to a memo seen by Reuters. Data from SPAC Research shows that since the start of 2021 alone, 144 SPACs have raised $45.7 billion globally, with backers including high-profile investors, politicians and sports personalities. JPMorgan’s co-head of M&A in EMEA, Guillermo Baygual, will work closely with Lukasz Dziarnowski - a seasoned banker who focuses on clients in Central and Eastern Europe as well as the Middle East and North Africa - to pioneer the SPAC bonanza in Europe and win a slice of lucrative advisory fees, according to the memo. Based in London, the pair will be involved in all SPAC merger discussions across the EMEA region and play matchmaking between SPAC entrepreneurs and possible targets, the memo said. “Guillermo and Lukasz should be involved in all SPAC merger discussions we are having across the EMEA region to maximize our collective insight into market activity, identify best practices and deliver top-quality execution,” the memo said. JPMorgan competes head-to-head with the likes of Deutsche Bank to dominate global SPAC league tables. SPACs raise money from investors with the aim of finding a private company to buy. If the sponsors fail to complete their desired merger within a certain timeframe, the SPAC is dissolved and the money returned to shareholders. Such vehicles have emerged as a popular IPO alternative for companies, especially in the United States, providing a path to going public with less regulatory scrutiny and more certainty over the valuation that will be attained and funds raised. JPMorgan’s dedicated SPAC taskforce already includes M&A vice-chairman Charlie Dupree and M&A executive director Albert Wong, both focusing on U.S. clients, while three other bankers - Ben Berinstein, Jeff Marks, and Rob Stuhr - provide broader corporate finance advisory for blank check clients in the United States. “SPAC M&A activity has continued to grow outside of the United States, particularly in Europe where SPAC M&A volume now represents 12% of the market since the beginning of Q4 2020,” said the memo. It was signed by JPMorgan’s global co-heads of M&A, Dirk Albersmeier and Anu Aiyengar, and by its global head of corporate finance advisory, Rama Variankaval. While creating a bespoke team of SPAC dealmakers, the memo said most bankers - especially those focusing on M&A and equity capital markets - should make a collective push to help deep-pocketed investors and former executives who are looking to front their own SPACs. Both Baygual and Dziarnowski will retain their existing roles, with Baygual also leading JPMorgan’s EMEA investment banking industries coverage for corporate clients. For all M&A deals involving SPACs, JPMorgan will deploy members of the SPAC Specialist Team as necessary “in addition to the relevant product and coverage bankers,” the memo said. JPMorgan recently advised on the merger of British electric van start-up Arrival into U.S. SPAC firm CIIG Merger Corp, which is expected to close in March and result in a U.S. listing at a market valuation of about $5.4 billion. It also worked closely with former Credit Suisse chief executive Tidjane Thiam, who is raising a $250m special purpose acquisition vehicle to invest in financial services businesses. A number of European banking executives are in the process of launching their owns SPACs, including former UniCredit boss Jean-Pierre Mustier - who recently teamed up with LVMH founder Bernard Arnault and ex-Bank of America dealmaker Diego De Giorgi - as well as former Commerzbank boss Martin Blessing and ex-UBS boss Sergio Ermotti."

Benjamin Wilson, head of shareholder activism defense for North America resigned this month to take another job in the banking industry while Kirshlen Moodley, who was head of the practice in Europe, Middle East and Africa, left late in 2020, the sources said. Wilson who has worked at JP Morgan since 2008 and rose through the ranks in the bank’s Mergers & Acquisitions department is moving to position at Guggenheim Partners, two sources said. Moodley, who worked at the bank for nine years, now works at BNP Paribas CIB in London, according to his LinkedIn profile. JP Morgan declined to comment. The moves come only a few months after the bank revamped its shareholder defense practice in August when it promoted David Freedman to oversee the business globally after David Hunker left the bank. Activism defense has become a major franchise for investment banks, as hedge funds such as Elliott Management, Starboard Value and Third Point push for changes at companies. There has been movement among banks in the last months. In January, UBS hired Aneliya Crawford from law firm Schulte Roth & Zabel LLP to co-head its activism defense group."

The banks will hold calls with investors from Wednesday to Friday on the three-year senior bond, which will be rated BB+ with a negative outlook by ratings agency Fitch, the trader said earlier on Tuesday. Credit Suisse declined to comment and JP Morgan was not immediately available for comment. San Marino, whose banking sector is struggling because of a large pile of non-performing loans, already sought to tap markets in October last year with a five-year bond but a deal did not surface after the investor meetings. Back then, San Marino was aiming to raise 300 million euros to help reorganise the liabilities of lender Cassa di Risparmio of San Marino and repay debt to the central bank to shore up liquidity in its banking system, according to an offering document sent to investors at that time.

16.183939050029913," UPDATE 4-Hong Kong stock exchange names JPMorgan's Aguzin as new chief executive (Replaces chairman quote from statement with live quote, adds Citi analyst) HONG KONG, Feb 9 (Reuters) - The Hong Kong stock exchange operator on Tuesday named JPMorgan Chase & Co’s international private bank head Nicolas Aguzin as its chief executive, a role in which he will be expected to step up the bourse’s links with China. The appointment of a non-Chinese person as CEO of the Hong Kong stock exchange operator surprised the market, and Aguzin will have to balance the wishes of authorities in Beijing, international institutions, and Hong Kong local brokers and traders. Aguzin, an Argentine, takes over HKEX at a time when shares of the company are near record highs boosted by high trading volumes, particularly through the stock connect schemes which link the Hong Kong bourse with mainland markets. He will replace Charles Li, another former JPMorgan banker, who announced his resignation as CEO of Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing (HKEX) in May. Aguzin, whose appointment is subject to approval from markets watchdog the Securities and Futures Commission, has been appointed for three years, starting May 24, HKEX said in a regulatory filing. “I’m surprised the CEO wasn’t more Chinese affiliated,” said Ashley Pittard, head of global equities at asset manager Pendal an HKEX shareholder “The future for the Hong Kong exchange is to tie up with mainland exchanges as a gateway to China’s financial hub so this is an interesting decision.” Aguzin is the first non mainland or Hong Kong-Chinese to be permanent CEO of HKEX since its formation in 2000 in a merger of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong with other local financial market infrastructure providers. “Our policy with the mainland will not change,” HKEX chairman Laura Cha told the media. “Currently we have a good core team of people who deal with mainland related matters ... So the fact that Mr Aguzin does not speak Chinese will not be a factor that will affect our policy or our relationship with our counterparts.” Hong Kong was the second most popular listing venue in the world in 2020 with deals worth $31.2 billion, compared to Nasdaq’s $51.3 billion, based on Refinitiv data. The exchange has benefited from a series of Chinese companies looking to raise capital in the Asian financial hub via primary floats, including Kuaishou’s $5.4 billion IPO this month , as well as secondary-listings from U.S.-listed Chinese companies such as tech firm JD.com. Citi analyst Tian Yafei said Aguzin’s international and investment banking experience could mean HKEX would attempt acquisitions to strengthen areas such as fixed income and currencies and data to diversify revenues away from cash trading. Aguzin’s appointment comes against the backdrop of Beijing’s imposition of national security legislation on the city that has clouded its outlook as a leading financial center. Aguzin was appointed as the CEO of JPMorgan’s international private bank in January 2019. He joined the Wall Street bank in 1990 in Argentina, and was based in Hong Kong as the chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Asia Pacific from 2012 to February 2020. Martin Marron, the chief current chief executive of JPMorgan’s Latin American private bank and head of its Latin America and Canadian operations will replace Aguzin, an internal memo seen by Reuters said. “(Aguzin) is an outstanding leader and human being ... While we’re disappointed he is leaving us, we thank him for his many accomplishments at our company and wish him all the best,” Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, said."

19.361135365058907," Former JPMorgan Asia top banker found not guilty of bribery HONG KONG (Reuters) - A Hong Kong judge on Monday found JPMorgan’s former vice chairman of Asia investment banking, Catherine Leung, not guilty of bribery following her trial held late last year, saying she had followed the bank’s existing procedures. Hong Kong’s Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC), in 2019, charged Leung with bribing the chairman of a logistics company, by employing his son at the bank’s Hong Kong office in 2010. She did so, the prosecution told the court last year, in anticipation that Ang Keng-lam, the then chairman of Kerry Logistics Network Ltd, would influence his company to give JPMorgan a role on its up-coming initial public offering (IPO). However, deputy district judge Emily Cheung told the court, when explaining the reasons for her not guilty verdict, that Leung had not played a major role in the decision to hire Ang’s son, Ang Ren-yi, and that Leung had followed procedures required under JPMorgan’s client referral programme. That programme allowed staff to refer the children or relatives of the company’s existing and potential clients for training or employment. Cheung said in a three hour-long explanation of her verdict that it was the responsibility of JPMorgan’s Junior Resources Management team to make checks with the bank’s legal and compliance department when employees were being hired under the scheme. Ang Ren-yi worked at JPMorgan from June 2010 until October 2011, according to court documents. Leung, who left the Wall Street bank in 2015 according to her LinkedIn profile, did not comment when approached by Reuters outside the courtroom on Monday. A representative of both Angs’ current employer Metropoly Holdings Ltd said they had no comment. An ICAC spokeswoman said the Commission “respects the court ruling. We will study the reasons for the verdict in consultation with the Department of Justice.” JPMorgan declined to comment.

18.99016005266123," JPMorgan to join British online banking chase within months LONDON (Reuters) - JPMorgan will launch a digital consumer bank in Britain under its Chase brand within months, marking its first foray into an already competitive British market. The new business has already recruited 400 people and will offer a range of products, including current accounts, JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets, said on Wednesday. At a time of growth for online finance, JPMorgan’s venture further ramps up competition in Britain’s digital banking sector, where it will compete with Goldman Sachs’ consumer brand Marcus which launched in Britain in 2018. The new digital bank will also be competing with start-ups such as Starling and Monzo, which have made some headway in grabbing market share from Britain’s four largest banks. Digital financial services globally have seen a boost in business during the COVID-19 pandemic, with more homebound consumers adopting online banking and investing. This is not JPMorgan’s first attempt at a digital-only bank. It launched a smartphone bank called Finn in its home market in 2017, but shut it down a year after its nationwide debut. Other large banks have also had mixed results when attempting to fend off competition through new digital offshoots. In May, NatWest said it was scrapping its digital bank Bó, after a tepid reception from consumers. Sanoke Viswanathan, previously chief administrative officer for JPMorgan’s corporate and investment bank, has been named as chief executive of the new digital bank, which will be headquartered in London’s Canary Wharf financial district. Its customers will be supported from a new call centre in the Scottish capital Edinburgh, which has long been home to a vibrant financial services sector. Reports of a likely tilt by JPMorgan at British consumer market have been circulating for around a year, but the bank had publicly disclosed few details. “The UK has a vibrant and highly competitive consumer banking marketplace, which is why we’ve designed the bank from scratch to specifically meet the needs of customers here,” Gordon Smith, CEO of consumer and community banking for JPMorgan, said in a statement."

10.798990895355569," JPMorgan board holds CEO Dimon's annual pay at $31.5 million JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N) Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon will not get a raise in his annual pay and will receive $31.5 million for his work in 2020, the bank said on Thursday. Dimon's total compensation will include the same annual base salary of $1.5 million and a performance-based incentive of $30 million, according to a regulatory filing. The bank said directors based the pay decision on ""the firm's strong performance"" last year during the coronavirus pandemic and over the long term across business results, risk controls and conduct; client, customer and stakeholder focus; and teamwork and leadership. The rationale provided by the board was similar to that offered for Dimon's compensation for 2019. Under Dimon, who turns 65 in March, JPMorgan produced net income of $29.1 billion for 2020, down from $36.4 billion a year earlier, and a return on tangible common equity of 14%, down from 19%. Profits at JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, and other banks were hurt by massive expense provisions for expected loan losses due to the pandemic. Low interest rates fostered by the Federal Reserve to support the economy also reduced lending margins. Incentive compensation for Dimon and other top JPMorgan executives is largely composed of restricted stock instruments. The bank also disclosed awards to other executives of restricted stock units, indicating their total compensation for 2020, including: Gordon Smith, co-president and CEO of Consumer & Community Banking, $22.5 million, unchanged from the year before. Daniel Pinto, co-president and CEO of the Corporate & Investment Bank, $24.5 million, up 9%. Mary Erdoes, CEO for Asset & Wealth Management, $21 million, unchanged.

12.309298090503852," Italy prosecutors ask for JPMorgan documents to be admitted in Eni, Shell Nigeria case MILAN (Reuters) - Italian prosecutors asked a Milan Court on Wednesday for documents sourced from U.S. bank JPMorgan to be filed as part of a corruption trial over the acquisition of an oilfield in Nigeria by Eni and Shell. The long-running graft case revolves around the purchase of the Nigerian OPL 245 offshore oil field in 2011 for about $1.3 billion. Prosecutors allege that about $1.1 billion of that was siphoned off to politicians and middlemen. At a public hearing, prosecutors asked the court to accept two emails sent to Italy by UK authorities. The emails originate from a separate London court case launched by the Nigerian government against JPMorgan Chase, claiming over $1.7 billion for its role in the disputed oilfield deal. The first is an email sent by former Nigerian Attorney General Mohammed Adoke Bello to JPMorgan from the email address of a company owned by Aliyu Abubakar - a Nigerian oilman whom prosecutors allege paid $500 million in cash as part of a bribe. In this email, seen by Reuters, Adoke sent the bank copies of the resolution agreement regarding the oilfield acquisition. The prosecutors said they considered it relevant to establish the relationship between Adoke and Abubakar. Adoke was charged last year for allegedly receiving bribes to facilitate the deal, and he pleaded not guilty to all charges. Abubakar’s trial will start in coming weeks in Milan. He denies any wrongdoing. The second email, also seen by Reuters, is between two JPMorgan officials expressing doubts about transferring $1.1 billion to two accounts at Nigerian banks. Milan magistrates said at Wednesday’s hearing they considered the email significant as it shows there were doubts within the bank over the transfer, which a Swiss and a Lebanese lender had previously refused to carry out. The Milan court will decide on Feb. 3 whether to admit the two documents in the case. JPMorgan declined to comment. It is not part of the Milan case. The companies and defendants involved in the Milan case, including Eni’s current CEO Claudio Descalzi, have all denied any wrongdoing. Milan prosecutors have asked for jail sentences for all the defendants and fines for the two oil giants. On Wednesday lawyers for Eni and Shell asked for the companies to be acquitted. The verdict is expected at the end of March."
10.405535783118786," JPMorgan trims loan reserves on hopes for recovery (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Friday as it released some of the cash it had built up against coronavirus-driven loan losses, although the bank cautioned that demand for loans was likely to remain sluggish this year. For most of last year, Main Street lenders were grappling with the economic fallout of the pandemic, setting aside tens of billions of dollars to cover potential loan defaults by struggling businesses and households. But speedy vaccine deployments and nearly $2 trillion in stimulus have raised hopes of a recovery from one of the worst downturn in decades, prompting banks to start unwinding some of their massive loan loss reserves. “You will have a better economy in the second half [of the year] because we have the vaccine coming, we have fiscal stimulus and people have saved up a lot of money,” JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said. “There will be a lot of pent-up demand and, hopefully, optimism because of the fact that we are getting through this mess. By sometime this summer you could have a very healthy economy.” JPMorgan CFO Jennifer Piepszak said the bank had the ability to repurchase up to $4.5 billion of stock in the first quarter, according to regulatory income-based limits on capital reductions. The pandemic has also caused a plunge in short and long-term interest rates that hurt interest income, but the Wall Street arms of the biggest banks have benefited from volatility in global financial markets, a rush for stock market listings and emergency corporate fundraising. JPMorgan’s net income rose 42% to $12.1 billion, or $3.79 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31. Revenue rose 3% to $30.2 billion. During the quarter, it released credit reserves of $2.9 billion, adding 72 cents to its earnings per share. Excluding the reserves, the bank reported net income of $9.9 billion, or $3.07 per share, which was well ahead of the average Wall Street estimate of $2.62 per share, according to Refinitiv. About 70% of JPMorgan’s beat came from reserve releases and much of the benefit was already priced into its stock, Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr estimated. Analysts called the results solid, considering low interest rates and business challenges during the pandemic. “These were strong results and the economic outlook is improving,” Schorr wrote in a note to clients. In the latest quarter, JPMorgan’s numbers also received a boost from continued strength in its trading and investment banking units. Investment banking revenue surged 37% to $2.5 billion, driven by higher advisory fees across all its products. Trading revenue rose 20% to $5.9 billion. Looking forward, JPMorgan said in a slide presentation to analysts that it expects its non-interest expenses to go up in 2021 to about $68 billion from $65.5 billion, as it makes another $1.5 billion of investments in its business and spends another $900 million on its technology. The spending plan continues JPMorgan’s practice of using its financial heft as the biggest U.S. bank to expand its business and take market share from other lenders as it fights to hold off non-bank competitors. Still, JPMorgan chief Dimon warned of “significant near-term uncertainty” and said the reserve takedown did not represent “core or recurring profits”, while other top executives warned that comparisons with 2020 will be “challenging,” due to a record performance from markets during the year. Shares of JPMorgan, Citigroup Inc and Wells Fargo & Co, which had seen a strong rally in the run-up to earnings, were all down in early trading even as they reported better-than-expected profits. Near-zero Federal Reserve interest rates led to a record reduction in net interest margins in 2020 - the difference between what banks charge for loans and what they pay out to depositors. JPMorgan’s net interest income fell 7% to $13.4 billion. Interest metrics are closely watched by investors to show how much central-bank policies are affecting income, and how well banks are managing their balance sheets. The bank’s other reporting lines held up well during the quarter. Three of JPMorgan’s four operating units reported higher revenue, with the consumer & community banking unit recording an 8% decline. Trading revenue surged as the bank benefited from volatility in financial markets with investors reassessing their portfolios at the end of the year."

Shares of JPMorgan, Citigroup Inc (C.N) and Wells Fargo & Co (WFC.N), which had seen a strong rally in the run-up to earnings, were all down in early trading even as they reported better-than-expected profits. Near-zero Federal Reserve interest rates led to a record reduction in net interest margins in 2020 - the difference between what banks charge for loans and what they pay out to depositors. JPMorgan's net interest income fell 7% to $13.4 billion. Interest metrics are closely watched by investors to show how much central-bank policies are affecting income, and how well banks are managing their balance sheets. The bank's other reporting lines held up well during the quarter. Three of JPMorgan's four operating units reported higher revenue, with the consumer & community banking unit recording an 8% decline. Trading revenue surged as the bank benefited from volatility in financial markets with investors reassessing their portfolios at the end of the year. "
13.631642668603208," Bristol Myers sees up to $25 billion a year of new revenue from current drug pipeline NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bristol Myers Squibb said on Monday that its current drug pipeline has the ability to replace up to $25 billion a year in lost revenue from patent expirations by the end of the decade. According to a presentation for JP Morgan’s annual healthcare conference, the company said anemia drug Reblozyl, as well as experimental heart drug mavacamten, psoriasis drug deucravacitinib and its cancer cell therapy franchise could each be responsible for more than $4 billion a year in revenue. Other drugs in the pipeline would make up the rest. Reblozyl and one of the cancer cell therapies were picked up in the company’s $74 billion acquisition of Celgene last year. It acquired mavacamten this year in a $13 billion purchase of MyoKardia Inc. “This really does speak to the importance of being able to not only source innovation internally, but having the financial wherewithal to be able to source innovation successfully externally,” Chief Commercial Officer Chris Boerner said in an interview. “That flexibility financially - and being willing to move quickly to become a partner of choice - is going to serve us well as we continue to navigate the loss of exclusivity for products in the future.” Bristol Myers is expected to pull in more than $27 billion in sales - around two-thirds of its revenue this year - from its top three drugs, cancer drugs Revlimid and Opdivo and blood thinner Eliquis. Revlimid will lose some of its U.S. patent exclusivity in 2022 and Eliquis could lose U.S. exclusivity after 2026. Opdivo’s patents also begin to expire later this decade. Shares of Bristol Myers closed at $62.49 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday."

Of the total payment that was due on Dec. 14, about 30 billion won was owed to Bank of America, 20 billion won to JP Morgan Chase and 10 billion won to BNP Paribas, Mahindra said.

Mahindra has since June been looking for a buyer for all or most of its 75% stake in the South Korean sport-utility vehicle (SUV) maker, which it bought from near-insolvency in 2010 but has struggled to turnaround. The move is part of a wider restructuring effort by Mahindra under which it is reviewing all of its loss-making businesses to cut costs and prioritise capital expenditure. Ssangyong has total outstanding loans of about 100 billion won ($92 million) to the three banks, Mahindra said.

26.36298853625132," JPMorgan sends pandemic relief policy recommendations to lawmakers (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co, the biggest U.S. lender, has laid out a set of policy recommendations for lawmakers, aimed at driving a swift recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic and reducing racial inequality. The paper, reported earlier by CNBC, suggests additional pandemic relief funding for lower-income families to support expenses and bring about financial stability among those who have lost their jobs during the pandemic. ""Existing structural barriers in the U.S., made worse by the current crisis, have created profound racial inequalities — straining families' economic mobility and restricting the U.S. economy,"" the bank said here. JPMorgan’s report comes against the backdrop of a deadlocked Congress over the size of a pandemic relief bill and follows the victory of Democrat Joe Biden over Republican Donald Trump in a highly contested U.S. presidential election. Talks aimed at delivering a fresh infusion of coronavirus relief to American families and businesses gathered momentum in the U.S. Congress on Friday, with a bipartisan group of lawmakers working to put the finishing touches on a new $908 billion bill. Other recommendations in JPMorgan’s report include promoting policies for families to build emergency savings, policies and programs that boost income and liquid assets and address the underlying challenges Black and Latino families face within the labor market.

The plans come as bank executives grapple with next year’s budgets and consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, which include low interest rates and higher costs for loan losses even as trading revenue has surged. As part of the incentive pay for traders, bonuses increase when market revenue rises. Wall Street firms routinely report higher compensation costs for traders after markets have been strong. “Traders obviously had a very good year and you would expect them to be up,” the source said. At the same time, the bank has been keen to show that it is holding the line on expenses broadly. “The bank’s bonus pools this year are generally down,” the person said.

Current owner U.S. utility PPL Corp in August launched the sale of WPD, which has a regulatory asset value of 7.7 billion pounds ($10.1 billion) with the help of U.S. investment bank JP Morgan , to focus on its U.S. operations. Based on its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) at 1.25 billion pounds ($1.67 billion) for the financial year ended in March, WPD could fetch a valuation of up to 12 billion pounds. Despite PPL’s gauging the interest of European utilities and investment funds, the power group has attracted just a small number of potential bidders, the sources said. The next regulatory regime for Britain’s networks, which sets fixed investment returns for grid owners and will only be decided in 2021, has refrained some companies from expressing their interest, the sources said. Two consortia are now left in the race, they said.

25.173316995249053," JPMorgan Chase to pay $250 million for failings in asset, wealth business WASHINGTON (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co has agreed to pay $250 million for risk management and other control failings in its asset and wealth management business, a U.S. regulator said on Tuesday, in the second chunky penalty for the bank in less than two months. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) said it found that JPMorgan’s risk management practices were “deficient and it lacked sufficient controls to avoid conflicts of interest.” The bank has since remediated the deficiencies that led to this action, it said. “We are committed to delivering best-in-class controls across our business, and we have invested significantly in and enhanced our controls platform over the last several years to address the issues identified,” a spokesman for the bank said in a statement. JPMorgan boasts one of the world’s largest and most complex asset and wealth management businesses, with $1.3 trillion in fiduciary assets and $27.8 trillion of non-fiduciary custody assets, the OCC said. The bank also provides a broad range of investment strategies to its fiduciary clients through a variety of investment vehicles. For several years, however, JPMorgan operated a weak management and control framework for its fiduciary activities and had an insufficient audit program for, and inadequate internal controls over, those activities, the OCC said. In its consent order with the bank, the OCC did not require changes to the way the bank manages client assets. Tuesday's OCC penalty comes after the U.S. derivatives regulator fined here JPMorgan $920 million in September to settle federal U.S. market manipulation probes into its trading of metals futures and Treasury securities, in a landmark case for the agency."

28.69657083734894," Exclusive: JPMorgan dominates gold market with record $1 billion precious metals revenue LONDON (Reuters) - JPMorgan has earned record revenue of around $1 billion so far this year from trading, storing and financing precious metals, vastly outperforming rival banks, two sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. The coronavirus has created a bonanza for investment banks dealing in gold, silver and other precious metals by triggering massive investor purchases and rupturing the normal workings of the market. But JPMorgan has dominated, growing its share of the market. The U.S. bank’s revenue by mid-November accounts for at least half of the $1.7 billion to $2 billion that consultancy McKinsey CIB Insights estimates the top 10 investment banks combined will make this year from precious metals, mostly gold. Its commodities division is on track to bring in more than $1.5 billion this year and could challenge Goldman Sachs for the title of top earner, the sources said. JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs declined to comment. Individual investment banks have rarely made more than $1 billion in commodities in recent years, and none has ever before earned more than around $600 million in precious metals in a single year, said George Kuznetsov at McKinsey CIB Insights. (For a graphic on Commodities bonanza, click ) JPMorgan is the largest bank in the United States and one of the biggest in the world. It sits at the heart of the global bullion market, and its activities span trading physical bars to derivatives, running vaults and clearing trades in London, the biggest trade hub. Driving profit has been the clamour for gold and silver from investors, mainly in Europe and North America, worried the coronavirus pandemic and money-printing by central banks could devalue other assets. These investors pushed gold prices to record highs above $2,000 an ounce earlier this year. Added to that are profits earned on the Comex futures exchange in New York, where supply issues earlier this year made it more lucrative for those with access to physical gold to trade precious metals. Banks such as JPMorgan took advantage of opportunities on Comex and helped clients do the same. JPMorgan’s client business dwarfs that of others. Data from CME Group, which runs Comex, show JPMorgan’s clients accounted for one-third of all trade in gold bars registered with the exchange in October, and more than two fifths in June. Like other big banks, JPMorgan was able to get and ship metal cheaply and in large quantities when other, smaller traders could not, sources said. The revenue windfall will likely fade as trading on Comex reverts to normal patterns, but high gold prices and interest from investors mean this business will remain profitable. “2020 is going to be an outlier year,” said Kuznetsov at McKinsey."

The two parties should split the difference between the amounts they want to devote to coronavirus relief, he said. “Just get it done,” he said, declining to blame one side over the other. The issue came up again in Congress on Wednesday, as U.S. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said he and House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi had formally invited Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and other Senate Republicans to bipartisan talks on relief legislation. Earlier in the day, McConnell said Congress should aim for agreement on items where there is little disagreement. But he blamed Democrats for blocking earlier Senate Republican efforts to approve spending packages of $500 billion, which Democrats have called inadequate. Dimon also advocated higher taxes to pay for stimulus spending, but said hikes have to be done in a way that does not harm economic growth. “Taxing my income a little bit more, that does not hurt growth,” he said. “Taxing capital formation, over time, hurts growth. We should have a competitive international tax system for business.”"

25.48932432920076," Nigeria case against JP Morgan over OPL 245 oil deal to go to trial LONDON (Reuters) - A lawsuit launched by the Nigerian government against U.S. bank JP Morgan Chase, claiming over $1.7 billion for its role in a disputed 2011 oilfield deal, will proceed to trial, London’s high court ruled on Thursday. The suit filed in the English courts in 2017 relates to the purchase of the offshore OPL 245 oilfield in Nigeria by oil majors Royal Dutch Shell and Eni in 2011, which is the subject of an ongoing trial in Milan. The six-week London trial will start on the first available date after Nov. 1 next year, meaning that proceedings may not begin until 2022. JP Morgan declined to comment. Central to the case is a $1.3 billion payment from Shell and Eni to secure the block that was deposited into a Nigerian government escrow account managed by JP Morgan. As part of the proceedings, JP Morgan will also have to disclose within 21 days which individuals at the bank made the final decision to transfer the funds in question. “Nigeria is pleased that JP Morgan has agreed it will now confirm all the senior figures at the bank who were involved,” a spokesman for the Nigerian government on this case said. “This claim will move forward and Nigeria will hold JP Morgan accountable for its central role in the OPL 245 fraud.” In the claim, Nigeria alleges JP Morgan was negligent in its decision to transfer the funds in escrow to a company controlled by the country’s former oil minister Dan Etete instead of government coffers. The damages sought include the monies allegedly sent to Etete, around $875 million paid out in three instalments, plus interest taking the total to $1.7 billion. The decision is also likely to compel the bank to disclose details of its internal processes. JP Morgan sought to quash the case last year. The Milan trial began in 2018. In July 2020, Italian prosecutors asked a Milan court for Eni and Shell to be fined and some of their present and former executives, including Eni CEO Claudio Descalzi, to be jailed. They further requested Eni and Shell to be fined 900,000 euros ($1.06 million) each and sought to confiscate a total of $1.092 billion from all the defendants in the case, the equivalent of the bribes alleged to have been paid. Shell and Eni and the managers accused in the Milan court case, including Eni CEO Claudio Descalzi, have all denied any wrongdoing. Final defence arguments from lawyers representing Shell, Eni and its executives are being made to the court. The next hearing is scheduled for Nov. 25.

20.74358822358902," Investors celebrate Biden winning U.S. presidency NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors and financial executives took a big sigh of relief on Saturday after major networks declared Democrat Joe Biden winner of the U.S. presidential election, offering some certainty after days of conflicting reports about who might run the White House next term. Although current President Donald Trump said he would fight the results in court, Wall Streeters who offered comments felt there was little doubt Biden would ultimately succeed. Election predictors including the Associated Press, NBC, Fox News and Edison Research, upon which Reuters relies, called the presidency for Biden. “Biden is good news for the markets,” Christopher Stanton, chief investment officer at Sunrise Capital Partners, said on Saturday. “We’re all so tired of the whipsaw that came with the Trump tweets.” Major U.S. stock indexes registered their biggest weekly gains since April this week, as investors bet Biden would win and Republicans would hold onto the Senate. That scenario would create a steadier hand in the Oval Office and a Congress that would check left-leaning impulses on taxes or regulations that pinch companies, investors said. However, there are lingering risks to asset prices in the days and weeks ahead. Republicans have already filed several lawsuits over ballot counting and Trump said his campaign will file more. The litigation could drag out election proceedings. Investor focus also now turns to the Senate, which remains undecided ahead of two runoff elections in Georgia on Jan. 5. The significance of those races, which could potentially end up with the Democrats controlling all three of the White House, Senate and House of Representatives, means January is “the new November” in terms of election volatility risk, Michael Purves, founder and CEO of Tallbacken Capital, said in a note to clients. Purves said that was evident when looking at contracts for the stockmarket’s fear gauge, the VIX, stretching out into the months ahead. Beyond those battles, investors have been worried about the people Biden might appoint to his Cabinet. Some of those officials would be negotiating with Congress about a relief package and have extensive powers to craft Wall Street rules. Current U.S. Federal Reserve governor and former McKinsey consultant Lael Brainard’s name has been floated as a potential Treasury Secretary, while Biden has already tapped former derivatives market regulator and Goldman Sachs Group Inc banker Gary Gensler for advice on financial regulation. For the moment, investors and prominent Wall Street figures said they were happy with the election finally being called after what seemed like unending tension as ballots were counted through the week. “Now is a time for unity,” JPMorgan Chase & Co Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said in a statement. “We must respect the results of the U.S. presidential election and, as we have with every election, honor the decision of the voters and support a peaceful transition of power.” Leon Cooperman, a billionaire former hedge fund manager who had previously criticized Democrats said he was pleased with the results. “It’s a signal to the world that America has not changed its values,” said Cooperman, of Omega Family Office. “That’s a good thing in my view.” Robert Wolf, a major Democratic donor and former UBS Group AG executive who now runs 32 Advisors, was enthusiastic: “I am ecstatic, relieved and deeply hopeful for the future of this country,” he said in a text message. Billionaire investor Bill Ackman wrote on Twitter: “There comes a time in the battle when one should fold the tent,” and urged: “Concede graciously and call for unity.” The financial industry was not reacting in a bubble: major cities from New York to San Francisco erupted in celebration on Saturday. Though Trump undoubtedly has significant support throughout the country, including on Wall Street, 2020 has been a difficult year for the United States. The coronavirus pandemic has taken a huge toll on the country, killing some 236,250 people so far, while social unrest over the police killing of George Floyd, a Black man, has only hardened divisions that already existed. Many voters were hoping for a decisive election that would offer some calm, whichever candidate they cast ballots for. Mohamed El-Erian, Allianz Group’s chief economic adviser, said he hoped a Biden administration could work with Congress to get a handle on the pandemic and pass an economic stimulus package for struggling Americans. “The country needs to come together to deal better with a surge in Covid infections that risks the loss of more lives, greater disruptions to livelihoods, and long-term economic, institutional and social scarring,” he said."

35.743744223988074," General Dynamics third-quarter sales fall amid aerospace headwinds, but margins rise WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Defense contractor General Dynamics Corp GD.N reported an 8.7% fall in third-quarter earnings on Wednesday, sending its shares lower as the coronavirus crisis continues to impact aerospace sales. Shares fell 1.1% in morning trading, and had earlier dropped 2.6% before the market opened. On an earnings conference call with investors , Chief Executive Phebe Novakovic reaffirmed a forecast given a quarter ago of 2020 earnings per share of between $11 and $11.10. Novakovic said that of 100,000 employees, 1,800 have had COVID-19, with 1,500 of those recovered and back at work. Profit margins rose to 11.5%, up slightly from the second quarter, as workflow techniques were improved during the pandemic. Margins were still down 1 percentage point from a year ago before the pandemic. The Gulfstream business jet maker delivered 32 planes to customers, six fewer than a year ago. Pandemic-related lockdowns have hindered jet deliveries since early in the year. Revenue at the aerospace unit fell 20.8% to $1.95 billion compared with a year ago. Profit margins at the unit also fell to 14.3% from 15.8% in the same period last year. The marine systems unit, which makes ships and submarines for the U.S. Navy, saw revenue up 7.6% compared with a year earlier. Half that growth comes from the Columbia-class submarine program, Novakovic said on the call with investors. Earnings per share fell to $287 million, or $2.90 per share, in the third quarter ended Sept. 27, from $291 million, or $3.14 per share, a year earlier. Analysts’ mean estimate for General Dynamics Corp was for earnings of $2.86 per share, according to Refinitiv IBES data. General Dynamics’ total order backlog at the end of the third quarter was $81.5 billion, up 21% from the year-ago quarter as the U.S. Department of Defense continues to place orders with U.S. defense contractors. Revenue at the Reston, Virginia-based company fell 3.4% to $9.4 billion."

30.90438797534219," 'Orderly' Trump win most favourable outcome for equities, JPMorgan says LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. investment bank JPMorgan expects the S&P500 index to surge to 3,900 points if U.S. President Donald Trump is re-elected next week, calling such an outcome the most favourable for stock markets. A rise to 3,900 would mark a 12.6% jump from Friday’s closing level. A clean sweep by Democrats would be “mostly neutral” for markets, JPM said in a note received on Monday, adding: “We see an ‘orderly’ Trump victory as the most favourable outcome for equities.” The odds of a “blue wave” have narrowed slightly since mid-October. Former vice president Joe Biden has a substantial lead in national opinion polls, although the contest is closer in battleground states likely to decide the race. JPMorgan said several of its data gatherings, such as voter registration, Twitter sentiment, point to a “tightening race”. The bank sees a gridlock in the election as a “net positive” for stocks. Within sectors, JPM sees beaten down energy and financial stocks to likely be key beneficiaries of a Trump victory, while a Biden win could trigger a rotation from U.S. growth stocks to non U.S. growth stocks, given the risk of higher taxes. “We find that energy, financials and healthcare sectors could likely see the most outsized moves as they have been explicitly referenced by each candidate on the campaign trail,” the bank added."

40.266696688725," JPMorgan executives offer slightly brighter view on pandemic recession (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N executives are cautiously optimistic that the coronavirus pandemic will not send the economy into the worst possible tailspin, and feel confident enough in the bank’s financial position to start repurchasing shares again soon if regulators allow. Their comments came on Tuesday after JPMorgan reported much stronger-than-expected results for the third quarter, beating profit estimates and setting aside relatively little money for loan losses. Only one of its four major units – consumer banking – saw revenue and profits decline, and even those customers are holding up relatively well, Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Piepszak said. Other businesses, including trading, investment banking, commercial lending and wealth management, posted gains. Although JPMorgan expects loan losses to escalate, and added another $611 million to its loan loss reserves, that figure is tiny compared to the previous quarter and smaller than what many analysts had expected. JPMorgan has the financial wherewithal to handle those losses and start buying back shares again if regulators will allow it, Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said. The Federal Reserve has ordered big banks to halt buyback programs and limit dividends through year-end. “We’ll be patient, but we have tremendous amount of wherewithal to do both when the time comes,” he said. “And I hope we’re allowed to do it before the stock is much higher.” JPMorgan shares fell 1.8% to $100.57 in morning trading. The stock is down 27.4% year-to-date. As the largest U.S. bank and one of the biggest global lenders, JPMorgan’s results are viewed as a barometer of the economy and financial markets. Its profit rose 4% to $9.4 billion, or $2.92 per share, in the third quarter, compared with $9.1 billion, or $2.68 per share, in the year-ago period. Analysts had expected its profit to fall, with a consensus estimate of $2.23 per share, according to Refinitiv. JPMorgan’s revenue fell slightly to $29.9 billion, but still came in ahead of expectations. Trading was a bright spot for the third consecutive quarter, as market volatility caused volumes to swell. Revenue there jumped 30% to $6.6 billion. Analysts cheered the results. Evercore ISI’s Glenn Schorr called JPMorgan “the Rickey Henderson of banks,” a reference to a celebrated Major League Baseball star. “JPMorgan put up as strong of a quarter as we could have hoped for,” he wrote in a note to clients. Executives were careful not to offer too sunny an outlook, especially because Congress has failed to pass another stimulus bill. Lockdowns intended to prevent the virus from spreading have put millions out of work and shuttered thousands of businesses, causing the worst recession in decades. JPMorgan looks at a range of possible economic outcomes when setting aside reserves, executives said. While its “base” case has improved from the second quarter, it could very well deteriorate again. “There’s so much uncertainty,” said Dimon. “If better outcomes happen, we are over-reserved by $10 billion. If the double-dip happens, we would be under-reserved by $20 billion.” So far this year, JPMorgan has added $19.4 billion to its credit loss provisions, more than four times the comparable figure for 2019. Low interest rates hurt JPMorgan’s results in a predictable way, as the U.S. Federal Reserve is keeping rates at nearly zero to offset the impact of the pandemic. JPMorgan’s net interest income fell 9% to $13.1 billion in the third quarter and its net interest margin dropped to 1.82%. Those metrics are closely watched by investors to show how much central-bank rate policies are affecting income, and how well banks are managing their balance sheets. JPMorgan maintained its forecast for full-year interest income at about $55 billion, but said adjusted annual expenses will be about $66 billion, worse than its prior forecast of $65 billion. JPMorgan’s results came in contrast to Citigroup Inc C.N, which also reported earnings on Tuesday. Citigroup beat analyst estimates but executives offered a less optimistic economic outlook, especially for its consumer business. Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N, Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N and Bank of America Corp BAC.N are scheduled to report results on Wednesday, with Morgan Stanley MS.N on Thursday."
40.266696688725," JPMorgan sticks with plan to build giant New York headquarters NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co is forging ahead with plans to build a mammoth new headquarters in New York, Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said on Tuesday, despite the coronavirus pandemic casting serious doubt on the future of office buildings. “We’re building that headquarters for 50 years! It is not a short-term decision,” Dimon said during a call with reporters after posting quarterly results. Slated to open in 2024, for a price tag of as much as $3 billion, the building at 270 Park Avenue is to house about 14,000 employees. At 1,425 feet, it would be the second-tallest office building in Manhattan behind One World Trade Center, nearly 200 feet higher than the Empire State Building and 225 feet above the nearby Bank of America Tower, according to the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat. An illustration by Lewis Garrison, a 3-D architectural illustrator who likes to make video flyovers of skylines, here envisions JPMorgan's new headquarters towering over Midtown Manhattan, a T-Rex in what might seem like a field of dinosaurs. But since pandemic lockdowns happened in March, far fewer workers have been going into offices, making it unclear why such a big skyscraper is necessary. JPMorgan has been showcasing new safety protocol and prodding white-collar employees to return, but New York’s financial centers are nothing like they were before the pandemic. Major thoroughfares are more populated than when virus fears ran high, but the Midtown lunch crowd remains sparse. The longer it goes on, the less temporary it seems. Companies will need 10% to 20% less office space in a post-pandemic world, several real-estate brokerages predict. Nearly three-quarters of respondents to a Piper Sandler & Co survey in mid-September said they expect to work from home more often, up from 59% in its June tally. Only one-in-five JPMorgan employees are going to offices in New York now, Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Piepszak said. The company does not expect that to change for the foreseeable future. JPMorgan will have a lasting shift toward working from home, Dimon said, but he doesn’t know how big the change will be. The bank has as many people assigned to other New York buildings as it plans to have in the skyscraper and can adjust if necessary, he said. “We have plenty of leeway in how we manage our real estate over time,” Dimon said. JPMorgan likely will adopt new floor plans that are less dense with larger conference rooms and perhaps more private offices, said Dennis Donovan, principal at Wadley Donovan Gutshaw Consulting. The bank will be able to do that from scratch instead of retrofitting. It may also be part of Dimon’s legacy, a building to last beyond the time anyone is talking about his expense ratios or return on equity. “It really is something that will endure well beyond COVID,” said Jesse Keenan, a real-estate professor at Tulane University.

Brent futures rose 18 cents, or 0.4%, to $43.52 a barrel by 11:56 a.m. EDT (1556 GMT), while U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude rose 14 cents, or 0.3%, to $41.33. Both contracts were on track for weekly gains of about 10% this week, their first increase in three weeks. Prices turned from slightly negative to slightly positive following news that U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin planned to hold talks later in the day amid ongoing negotiations for further COVID-19 federal aid package. Pelosi said she hopes the Democrats and the administration can reach a deal soon. In Norway, oil workers could end their 10-day strike later on Friday if a set of new proposals from the oil industry proves satisfactory, the head of the Lederne trade union told Reuters. An escalation of the strike could almost triple the existing outage if no solution is reached by Oct. 14, taking the total capacity cut to about 934,000 barrels of oil equivalents per day. Hurricane Delta, meanwhile, has shut 1.67 million barrels per day, or 92%, of U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil output, the most since 2005 during Hurricane Katrina. “We believe we are soon in for an oil price correction when the Norway strike is resolved and when the hurricane in the U.S. goes away ... These $40+ price levels are as fragile as glass,” Rystad’s Head of Oil Markets, Bjornar Tonhaugen, said. Looking ahead, JP Morgan said that a worsening global oil demand outlook due to a potential rise in coronavirus cases this winter would likely prompt the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) to reverse a planned easing of oil cuts in 2021, with Saudi Arabia offering deeper cuts below its current quota.

37.21897614080633," Inflation would be trigger for Brazil rate hike, not spending cap breach -central bank chief BRASILIA, Oct 7 (Reuters) - Brazil’s central bank president Roberto Campos Neto on Wednesday said that any trigger for higher interest rates would be linked to inflation, not a breach in the government’s spending cap rule. In an event hosted by JP Morgan last week, Campos Neto had said that the bank would withdraw its ‘forward guidance’ pledge not to raise rates if the spending cap is breached, three sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters. In an interview with Jovem Pan radio broadcast on Wednesday, Campos Neto said that he wanted to emphasize that the bank would abandon forward guidance is the government’s key fiscal rule were broken. “It was interpreted in some way as if the central bank was saying it was going to raise interest rates, and it wasn’t that,” Campos Neto said, warning, however, that fiscal slippage could fuel inflation expectations. “If there is a breakdown or we think that some type of creative accounting will make the long-term debt profile worse, our initial reaction is to remove this instrument (forward guidance) that forecasts lower rates for a longer time,” he said. Brazilian markets have come under pressure in recent weeks due to growing uncertainty and confusion on how the government plans to fund its new welfare program ‘Renda Cidada’ without breaking the ‘spending ceiling’ rule that limits public spending growth to the rate of inflation. The new program is due to replace the current popular Bolsa Familia scheme at the start of next year but will be more expensive. The central bank’s benchmark Selic rate is a record low 2.00%.

The Trump administration is preparing to pull the United States - one of the world’s biggest emitters of planet-warming greenhouse gases - out of the Paris accord adopted by nearly 200 nations with the aim of limiting global warming to “well below” 2 degrees Celsius and ideally to 1.5 degrees. While the use of lower-carbon technology is growing within the electric power and automotive sectors, JPMorgan said, few options are available to replace oil and natural gas in long-distance transportation and heavy industry. To track the progress towards the goals set in the Paris Agreement, JPMorgan said it will aim to evaluate its clients’ carbon footprint relative to their output, and provide insight into changes in performance. “The goals set in the Paris Agreement are commendable and ambitious, but the world is not on track to meet them,” said Daniel Pinto, co-president of JPMorgan Chase. “While the world has a long way to go, we at JPMorgan Chase want to do more.”"

31.42542757595112," JPMorgan to pay $920 million for manipulating precious metals, treasury market (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co has agreed to pay more than $920 million and admitted to wrongdoing to settle federal U.S. market manipulation probes into its trading of metals futures and Treasury securities, the U.S. authorities said on Tuesday. The landmark multi-agency settlement lifts a regulatory shadow that has hung over the bank for several years and marks a signature victory for the government’s efforts to clamp down on illegal trading in the futures and precious metals market. JPMorgan will pay $436.4 million in fines, $311.7 million in restitution and more than $172 million in disgorgement, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) said on Tuesday, the biggest-ever settlement imposed by the derivatives regulator. Between 2008 and 2016, JPMorgan engaged in a pattern of manipulation in the precious metals futures and U.S. Treasury futures market, the CFTC said. Traders would place orders on one side of the market which they never intended to execute, to create a false impression of buy or sell interest that would raise or depress prices, according to the settlement. This manipulative practice, which is designed to create the illusion of demand, or lack thereof, is known as “spoofing.” Some of the trades were made on JPMorgan’s own account, while on occasions traders manipulated the market to facilitate trades by hedge fund clients, the CFTC said. The bank failed to identify, investigate, and stop the behavior, even after a new surveillance system flagged issues in 2014, the agency said. “The conduct of the individuals referenced in today’s resolutions is unacceptable and they are no longer with the firm,” said Daniel Pinto, co-president of JPMorgan and CEO of the Corporate & Investment Bank. He added that the bank had invested “considerable resources” in boosting its internal compliance policies, surveillance systems and training programs. In parallel settlements, the bank entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement with the Department of Justice and the United States Attorney’s Office for the District of Connecticut, staving off criminal prosecution on charges of wire fraud. It also agreed to pay $35 million to settle related charges with the Securities and Exchange Commission, although the bank’s payment to the CFTC would offset that fine, it said. In an unusual concession, JPMorgan also admitted wrongdoing in agreeing to the SEC and Justice Dept. settlements. “This record-setting enforcement action demonstrates the CFTC’s commitment to being tough on those who intentionally break our rules, no matter who they are. Attempts to manipulate our markets won’t be tolerated,” said CFTC Chairman Heath Tarbert. The CFTC and Justice Department have taken aim at spoofing in recent years, using sophisticated data analysis tools to spot potential wrongdoing that it could not previously detect. Reuters has reported that around 2017, the agency began using techniques it originally developed to spot healthcare fraud schemes to identify suspicious trading patterns, including by scanning activity on exchanges. “The idea was: let’s mine this data source to see who the worst actors are,” Robert Zink, a top Justice official who helped lead the effort, told Reuters in May here. The agency has already charged six JPMorgan traders for manipulating metals futures between 2008 and 2016. On Friday, meanwhile, two former Deutsche Bank AG traders were found guilty here by a federal jury of spoofing, the agency said."

The shift sees JPMorgan follow similar moves by other big banks in Britain, as regulators in continental financial hubs such as Frankfurt and Dublin urge banks to book their assets locally. Barclays for example has moved its European headquarters and almost 200 billion euros in assets to Dublin, Reuters reported last year. The source did not specify what type of assets JPMorgan was moving to Germany, but for banks making similar moves, it would typically include cash and financial securities such as stocks and bonds that banks hold in inventory for clients to trade. A JPMorgan spokeswoman declined to comment. The shift in assets represents part of banks’ routine planning for life after Britain leaves the European Union, when they will likely no longer be able to book their entire trading operations for the contintent out of London. Clients of those banks in Europe will now trade with the lenders’ local banking entities rather than the UK-based subsidiary. Banks using Britain as a gateway to the European Union must fully execute their plans for serving EU customers before a Brexit transition period ends in December, the EU’s banking watchdog said in July. Last year, consultancy EY said assets worth nearly $1 trillion were being moved from Britain to new financial hubs in the European Union ahead of Brexit.

30.832515408995032," Keys takeaways from the FinCen Files (Reuters) - Shares of the biggest global banks dropped on Monday after news reports said they allowed large sums of allegedly illicit funds to move through the financial system, despite red flags about the origins of the money. Britain-based HSBC Holdings PLC and Standard Chartered PLC fell to 25-year lows, while U.S. banks JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bank of New York Mellon Corp were down 4.1% and 4.7%, respectively. These lenders were named in recent articles by BuzzFeed News and the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, based on leaked documents, known as the FinCEN Files. Here are the key takeaways from the reports: 1. What are the FinCEN Files? The investigative series is named after the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, or FinCEN, which receives alerts from banks and other financial firms about transactions that appear to be questionable. Those alerts are called suspicious activity reports, or SARs. Financial institutions filed SARs for more than $2 trillion worth of transactions between 1999 and 2017, according to the reports. The leaked files pertained to roughly 2,100 SARs filed with FinCEN between 2011 and 2017, representing less than 0.02% of the more than 12 million SARs during that time. Among the types of transactions highlighted by the report: funds processed by JPMorgan for potentially corrupt individuals and companies in Venezuela, Ukraine and Malaysia; money from a Ponzi scheme moving through HSBC; and money linked to a Ukrainian billionaire processed by Deutsche Bank AG. 2. Why would a transaction be deemed “suspicious”? U.S. federal laws require certain financial institutions to file SARs if there are signs of money laundering, insider trading, cyber attacks or various types of fraud. The existence of a report does not confirm wrongdoing, but alerts regulators to possible criminal activity. Banks, money exchanges, securities brokers, insurance companies, casinos and other financial institutions are required to file SARs within 60 days of detection, according to the Treasury Department. 3. What went wrong? U.S. agencies tasked with enforcing money-laundering laws rarely took any action after receiving SARs, nor did big banks after filing them, according to the FinCEN Files. As a result, the millions of suspicious activity reports had little-to-no effect on policing the global financial system, the articles said. 4. What does it mean for banks? It is not entirely clear what negative consequences, if any, banks highlighted in the FinCen Files stories may face. Analysts on Monday said the revelations were unlikely to lead to additional regulatory penalties or fines, because the behavior detailed in the articles showed that the system is flawed, but did not make clear that the banks had broken any rules or laws. It is possible that some banks with dated technology may have to spend more money improving compliance systems, and that politicians who typically criticize the industry will scrutinize the matter further, but there was no immediate sign that was happening yet. “Unless there are more substantive allegations of fact, we expect that (these articles) will not have lasting impacts on the industry or stock prices,” Oppenheimer analyst Chris Kotowski wrote in a note to clients."
22.54511131864754," Breakingviews - Green bonds could slide into irrelevance LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Green bonds are booming. Everyone from JPMorgan to Germany is issuing securities earmarked for environmentally friendly projects. Yet the benefits of the $800 billion market in channelling new money to green causes are less obvious. Green bonds just mean a company issues securities and earmark proceeds for projects like wind farms. That gives the investor certainty how the money is spent. This year as much as $350 billion of the bonds could be created, the Climate Bonds Initiative reckons. Yet the securities may not always be used for very green ends. Oil and gas group Repsol’s 2017 bond, for example, was used to make refineries more efficient. The market is getting more vigilant. Dirtier bonds are excluded from indexes, and third-party firms scrutinise how funds are used. The European Commission’s Taxonomy, which says what’s green and what isn’t, will tighten the screw. However, even the darkest green bonds only serve a narrow purpose: They tell investors a lot about the projects they fund, but not much about the company that issues them. An issuer can allocate funds for renewable projects, but that doesn’t make its overall business any greener. A recent Bank for International Settlements report showed that green bonds issuance does not lead to falling or even comparatively lower carbon emissions by the firms selling them. Green bonds could become more useful if they stimulated new green investment by giving companies a new, cheaper source of funding. Yet that is unlikely, because the credit risk of green bonds is exactly the same as an issuer’s other bonds. If yields on green bonds fall too much out of whack with similar dirty bonds, investors will arbitrage the difference. While there is sometimes a green premium, or “greenium”, it is usually tiny. One solution would be to require issuers to also abide by emission reduction targets. Italian utility Enel has gone a step further; abandoning green bonds in favour of debt with coupons linked to its sustainability goals. Even so-called sustainability-linked bonds like these may just be a stopgap. As more capital pours into funds that focus on environmental, social and governance factors, bond markets will differentiate better between green and dirty companies. Green bonds would then become irrelevant."

22.317174635947953," JPMorgan sends some traders home after worker contracts COVID-19: Bloomberg News (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N sent some of its Manhattan workers home this week after an employee in equities trading tested positive for COVID-19, Bloomberg News reported on Tuesday, citing a person familiar with the matter. News of the infection, on the fifth floor of the bank's 383 Madison Ave. building, was communicated to employees on Sept. 13, according to the report here. A JPMorgan spokesman said the bank has been “managing individual cases across the firm over the course of the last few months and following appropriate protocols when they occur.” The bank executives had previously told managing directors and some executive directors within its sales and trading operation that they must return to the office by Sept. 21. Earlier on Tuesday, before the media report, JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon dismissed concerns over asking staff to return to the office. Dimon, who said he has been going to the office for three months, noted that productivity had dropped in certain jobs. He also said working from home has negative effects in society that most people don’t appreciate, including drug overdoses. “Everything we do is good,” Dimon said. Wall Street banks had sent workers home in mid-March to help stem the spread of the virus, but that proved disruptive for some heavily regulated or technology-intensive functions, such as trading and other compliance roles. JPMorgan in April was the first big bank to announce steps to return to normal amid a growing debate over reopening the U.S. economy. At the time, the company said it was working on a plan to bring thousands of employees who have been working from home back onsite in stages."

22.317174635947953," JPMorgan cuts outlook for net interest income on lower rates NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N expects about $55 billion in net interest income for full-year 2020, down from an earlier estimate of $56 billion, Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Piepszak said on Tuesday. Piepszak, at a virtual conference hosted by Barclays, also said the current trend points to 2021 net interest income of about $13 billion per quarter. JPMorgan’s third-quarter trading revenue will be up about 20% from a year earlier, Piepszak said. Citigroup Inc C.N expects third-quarter markets revenue will be up by a ""low double-digit"" percentage from a year earlier, Chief Financial Officer Mark Mason said on Monday at the same conference. JPMorgan does not expect to add a meaningful amount to its loan loss reserves after making large provisions at the end of the first and second quarters, she said. Banks are earning less interest on loans while the Federal Reserve holds interest rates down to support the economy. Trading revenue at the biggest banks has been one of the few bright spots in their results since the coronavirus outbreak. Piepszak said the bank has reserved for worse loan losses than it would expect under its base case for the economy. “While things do look a little bit better than we thought they would, we’re still dealing with an enormous amount of uncertainty looking ahead,” she said. “We would have to have confidence in the outlook before we would release reserves,” she said. Piepszak added that slack loan demand is weighing on net interest income. Consumers are paying off more of their credit card charges and paying down home loans, she said. And, many businesses quickly paid back the money they had borrowed on revolving credit lines when the pandemic started. “Loan growth, I think it is fair to say, will be challenged,” Piepszak said."

22.317174635947953," JPMorgan and BlackRock tap AI startup to automate opening custody accounts LONDON (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co and BlackRock Inc have teamed up with artificial intelligence (AI) technology startup Saphyre to automate the opening of custody accounts, the companies said on Tuesday. The system, which uses AI to remember when an asset manager has already uploaded a specific document needed to open a custody account, has been tested for the past six months and will now be used by the bank with BlackRock and other asset managers. The companies believe the system will make new funds get to market quicker by streamlining what is now a heavily manual process involving reams of paperwork, spreadsheets and faxes. “The custody side, historically, has been a very traditional industry operating steadily and reliably with faxes and spreadsheets,” said Naveen TV, managing director, product development in securities services at JPMorgan. “Asset managers are starting to realize that the lack of automation is causing issues, and is actually a missed opportunity to be more efficient.” The partnership comes as large financial institutions increasingly turn to tech-savvy startups to help them automate and digitize some of their burdensome processes. JPMorgan, which has $27.4 trillion of assets under custody, took on over $1 trillion of BlackRock’s assets in 2017. The bank has securities services operations in 30 countries and a custodial network in more than 95 markets. “We are digitizing this whole pre-trade space,” said Gabino Roche, Saphyre’s chief executive. “This becomes more important in the post COVID-19 world.” In many cases, COVID-19 lockdowns have further slowed down the process of setting up custody accounts, as a lot of the documents required need to be printed and signed by multiple parties, said JPMorgan’s TV. Many financial institutions do not allow printing of sensitive documents at home and with most people working remotely documents need to be sent to various locations to get signatures, he said."
16.519702668343296," UK lawmaker to lead competition review in light of pandemic, Brexit LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s finance ministry said a review of the country’s competition rules would consider ways they could be improved as the economy emerges from the COVID-19 pandemic and starts life outside the ambit of the European Union.

Dimon made the comments on Friday to stock analyst Brian Kleinhanzl of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, who wrote about their meeting in a report. Dimon added that earlier government stimulus had delayed the full effects of the recession. As it hits, customers who have borrowed from the banks will feel the impact, the note said. Consumers are spending less. “Based on their data it is unclear if that trend is getting better or worse,” Kleinhanzl wrote. JPMorgan is largest U.S. bank by assets and estimates spending trends from transactions through accounts in its 4,900 branches and its credit card businesses. Dimon also said that having employees work from home during the pandemic has hurt overall productivity and reduced what he called the “creative combustion” that happens more in offices, Kleinhanzl wrote. JPMorgan is moving to people back into the office safely, Dimon said. “Jamie thinks a shift back to the office will be good for the young employees and to foster creative ideas,” Kleinhanzl wrote."

Individuals who fraudulently obtained loans under the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program had not been acting as JPMorgan employees, the person said. However, breaking the law was a violation of the bank’s code of conduct and some people were fired as a result of their improper EIDL applications, the person added. The lender found that some of its own staff had deposited suspicious EIDL funds in their Chase checking accounts, according to the report. Those cases accounted for a “very small” percentage of the total suspicious activity uncovered by JPMorgan, the person said. Reuters reported on Tuesday that the lender was probing employees who may have been involved in the misuse of funds intended for COVID-19 relief, citing an internal memo.

23.23066686705298," JPMorgan probing alleged misuse of PPP funds by employees, memo shows (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co is investigating employees who may have been involved in the misuse of federal funds meant to help small businesses and other customers hurt by COVID-19 shutdowns, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters. The bank said it had found cases of customers “misusing Paycheck Protection Program loans, unemployment benefits and other government programs,” according to the memo, which was verified by a bank spokeswoman. “Some employees have fallen short, too,” according to the memo, which was sent to staff by the bank’s top operating committee. “We are doing all we can to identify those instances, and cooperate with law enforcement where appropriate.” The JPMorgan memo is one of the first signs that lenders and their staffs may be swept up in federal efforts to police pandemic-related aid programs. In May, Reuters reported that the U.S. Justice Department had subpoenaed Wall Street banks to seek records on PPP lending as it kicked off its enforcement efforts, but it was unclear if the banks themselves were targets at the time here. A Justice Department spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. U.S. lawmakers and independent watchdogs have in recent weeks warned of widespread abuse and fraud in the PPP, a $659 billion program under which banks dished out government-backed funds to small business borrowers hurt by pandemic shutdowns. Just last week, a key congressional panel said it had identified tens of thousands of PPP loans worth billions of dollars that may have been subject to fraud, waste and abuse, including by companies that were ineligible or that broke the rules by taking more than one loan. The Small Business Administration, which administered the PPP, said in July that JPMorgan was the largest lender to the program by loan value, dishing out 270,000 loans worth nearly $30 billion. The SBA has also warned of “strong indicators of widespread potential fraud” in its economic disaster loan program. The Justice Department has already brought multiple criminal actions against individuals for allegedly stealing federal aid, including to fund lavish lifestyles."

20.75891712204186," JPMorgan inches closer to taking 71% of China securities JV BEIJING (Reuters) - JPMorgan JPM.N has first right to buy a 20% stake in its Chinese securities joint venture that has been put up for sale by one of its local partners for 177.7 million yuan ($26.02 million), a filing by the partner showed on Thursday. The potential transaction could take the U.S. bank’s stake from 51% to 71% as it edges closer to full ownership of a securities entity in China at a time when geopolitical relations between the United States and China remain fragile. A JPMorgan spokesman declined to comment on the likely sale. The state-owned Shanghai Waigaoqiao FTZ is selling its stake in the joint venture, which made a net loss of 86.8 million yuan in 2019, according to its filing on the Shanghai United Assets and Equity Exchange. JPMorgan was the only candidate that could raise its ownership with priority rights in the securities joint venture, the filing showed, as the remaining four shareholders had given up their rights to purchase the 20% stake. The securities joint venture consists of investment banking, research, equities and fixed income businesses. JPMorgan’s development came after Citigroup received regulatory approval on Wednesday to take full ownership of a custodian business in mainland China. China has overhauled regulations to grant foreign firms greater access to its financial sector which is worth trillions of dollars. It has also allowed foreign institutions to fully own companies in the securities and mutual fund sectors since April 1, positioning Wall Street and European banks to compete for a slice of the world’s second-largest economy. JPMorgan received regulatory approval last December to establish the 51%-owned securities joint venture.

Reuters had reported in February that the companies were discussing a deal. Blockchain emerged over a decade ago as the software powering cryptocurrency transactions. Since then, banks and other large corporations have been investing millions of dollars to develop and test a range of business applications using the nascent technology. Efforts have had mixed results, with few projects achieving significant impact. JPMorgan built the Quorum blockchain internally using the ethereum network, the software that underpins ether, one of the most well known cryptocurrencies. Quorum, which will remain open-source, is being used by the bank to run the Interbank Information Network, a payments network that involves more than 300 banks. The network and other bank projects running on Quorum will continue to operate using the platform, JPMorgan said.

He remains a lawmaker in Britain’s parliament but is to take up a post as a member of the U.S. bank’s advisory council for Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA). “We are delighted to welcome Sajid back to JPMorgan as a senior adviser, and we look forward to drawing upon his in-depth understanding of the business and economic environment to help shape our client strategy across Europe,” a spokesman for the bank said in a statement. Javid began his career in finance at Chase Manhattan, which later merged with JP Morgan, and worked in a number of roles in its currencies and emerging market businesses. He then joined Deutsche Bank, running several of the German lender’s trading businesses in Asia before being elected to Britain’s parliament in 2010. JPMorgan regularly appoints ex-government ministers to advisory posts, with former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair and ex-Finnish Prime Minister Esko Aho among its previous appointees. Former Italian finance minister Vittorio Grilli has just become chair of the EMEA advisory council."

(PPC) DEHr.AT, said on Wednesday it has finalised a deal to sell off unpaid bills to investment bank JP Morgan that will raise about 200 million euros ($235 million). PPC is struggling under a pile of about 2.7 billion euros of electricity bills owed by Greeks hard up because of the country’s decade-long debt crisis. Sources told Reuters in June that PPC, which is 51% state-owned, was close to selling off the bills. In a stock market filing on Wednesday, PPC said it had signed contracts to sell bills in arrears of up to 60 days. Finacity Corporation arranged the transaction. PPC said last month it had also finalised the terms for securitising a second tranche of bills worth 1.7 billion euros that are in arrears by more than 90 days, seeking to raise 300 million-350 million euros."
8.605184631470669," Portfolio trading grows in choppy bond markets: JP Morgan LONDON (Reuters) - Portfolio trading is gaining significant momentum as market turmoil picks up, with J.P. Morgan’s credit trading desk already handling more than three-quarters of the volume of trades this year executed in the whole of 2019, a client report showed. Last year’s volumes had already more than doubled from 2018 levels, according to the report, seen by Reuters. Portfolio trading, which involves bundling several bonds into a single package to trade, was once a time-consuming process that is gaining traction thanks to tech innovation. It also proved popular among traders during the recent coronavirus-linked market mayhem, anecdotal evidence suggests. “Halfway through 2020, the desk has already printed 77% of last year’s volume,” the note seen by Reuters said. “Couple these figures with the fact that three of the past five months have yielded a rise in monthly inquiry and traded volumes, it becomes clear to JP Morgan that portfolio trading is gathering momentum.” The turmoil unleashed by the coronavirus pandemic has forced liquidity to dry up even in the deepest parts of the global bond markets, with a surge in corporate debt issuance making the task of trading bonds extremely difficult. Portfolio trading is a relatively new entrant in the bond market, with the strategy taking root in the United States and spreading to Europe last year as trading platforms move to electronic execution of the trading and settlement process. The interest in portfolio trades comes as a surge in corporate bond issuance adds pressure on traders and banks such as JP Morgan - a top dealer in European bond markets, according to a Greenwich survey - to find faster and more cost efficient ways to trade."

Increased scrutiny from investors, regulators and climate change activists is prompting miners to limit their exposure to fossil fuels. BHP’s Mt Arthur open cut mine, in the Hunter Valley region of New South Wales, supplies thermal coal, used as fuel for power plants, to domestic and international customers and could fetch between $1.5 billion and $1.8 billion, banking sources said on condition of anonymity. Thermal coal only accounts for 3% of the portfolio of BHP, which has been asked by green groups and some shareholders to leave any industry associations with policies that fail to match the company’s support for the 2015 Paris climate accord. Its activist investor Elliott, which holds a 4.7% stake in the mining company, has pushed for the sale of the thermal coal assets, which also include one third of the Cerrejon mine in Colombia. BHP and JP Morgan declined to comment. Rival mining companies have also taken steps to go thermal coal free, with Rio Tinto selling its last coal mines in 2018, and Anglo American considering the spinoff or sale of its South African coal operations within the next two or three years. There is only a handful of companies including Australia’s Whitehaven Coal Ltd and India’s Adani Enterprises likely to express interest in the Mt Arthur mine, the sources said. Sales processes have slowed over the past few months, as government lockdowns to contain the novel coronavirus halted mine visits and due diligence. But as lockdown measures are gradually lifted, banking sources expect activity to resume in the coming months, with BHP’s sale of Mt Arthur possible by the end of the year.

0.3723226988738757," JPMorgan gets China's nod for first fully foreign-owned futures business HONG KONG (Reuters) - China on Thursday approved JPMorgan's JPM.N application to operate the first fully foreign-owned futures business, as the world's second-largest economy pushes ahead with opening its multi-trillion-dollar financial market. The latest regulatory approval for a U.S. financial services company coincides with tension between Beijing and Washington, increased by the COVID-19 pandemic and China’s move to impose security legislation on Hong Kong. JPMorgan reportedly sought full control of its China futures joint venture last December as Beijing moved to scrap caps on foreign ownership. The futures industry in China is dominated by local players. The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) said in a statement posted on its website the approval would bring in more qualified foreign players. JPMorgan had no immediate comment. China's central bank on Saturday gave the final nod to a network clearing licence for an American Express AXP.N joint venture, allowing it to be the first foreign credit card company to launch onshore operations in China. The approval for JPMorgan to launch its futures business follows on from other licences the bank has received in the last six months to increase its shareholding in other financial services business in China. Caps on the foreign ownership of futures companies were scrapped at the start of this year. China is a “critical market” for clients globally, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said in December when the bank received approval to establish a majority-owned securities joint venture, offering brokerage, investment advisory and underwriting services. In April, the biggest bank in the U.S. said it would raise its stake in a Chinese mutual fund venture to 100%."

2.1877279074928735," Saudi oil market share set to hit highest since 1980s: J.P. Morgan LONDON (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia’s share of the oil market is set to rise this decade to its highest since the 1980s as investment in production elsewhere dries up in the wake of the coronavirus crisis, J.P. Morgan said in a report. Oil prices have plunged more than 40% this year after an unprecedented collapse in demand, prompting oil and gas companies to announce spending cuts that will total $625 billion by the end of the decade, according to the Wall Street bank. The investment crunch will lead to a loss of output that is set to push benchmark Brent oil prices to $60 a barrel within two years, J.P. Morgan analyst Christyan Malek told Reuters. (GRAPHIC - JPM oil supply and demand: ) Brent LCOc1 fell as low as $16 a barrel in April as the pandemic forced economies around the world to lock down and it is currently trading near $40 a barrel. [O/R] The U.S. bank expects global oil demand to average 91 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2020, 9 million lower than earlier estimates, with consumption only recovering to pre-pandemic levels of 100 million bpd in November 2021. But changes in consumption patterns will lead to a permanent demand loss of 3 million bpd this decade compared with previous forecasts, J.P. Morgan forecasts. Oil supply, meanwhile, is set to fall by 5 million bpd due to a lack of investment in new output and the closure of some fields. With the lowest production costs and biggest capacity, Saudi Arabia is best placed to take up the slack, the bank said. “Saudi Arabia will come out on top in the fight for market share as non-OPEC and U.S. production fades,” Malek said. U.S. shale oil production, which grew sharply throughout the 2010s, will barely rise this decade, climbing only to 11 million bpd by 2030 from 10.9 million this year, the bank forecast. Before the slide in oil prices, shale output was expected to reach 17 million bpd by the end of this decade. As a result, J.P. Morgan expects members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting countries (OPEC) to fill the supply gap, once oil prices reach $60 a barrel, which is the price OPEC countries need on average to balance their budgets. While OPEC’s market share fell from a peak of 39% of total oil supply in 2016 to 33% in 2020-21, the bank expects the group to regain a market share of about 40% by 2025. Saudi Arabia’s market share is set to grow from 11.6% in 2020 to 15% over the period, a level not seen since the 1980s, Malek said."

In a Monday night filing with the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, lawyers for the investors said the “ice breaker” settlements could be a catalyst for settlements with the other bank defendants. These defendants include affiliates of Banco Santander, Bank of America, BBVA, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank, HSBC and UBS. JPMorgan is paying $15 million, and Barclays is paying $5.7 million. Both denied wrongdoing in agreeing to settle. Neither bank immediately responded on Tuesday to request for comment. Investors led by several pension funds accused the defendant banks of operating as a “cartel” from January 2006 to April 2017 by sharing pricing and other transaction data, including through chatrooms, to maximize their profits at investors’ expense. The private litigation began after Mexico’s antitrust watchdog, the Federal Economic Competition Commission (COFECE), began a probe into possible collusion. That culminated last October in accusations against seven of the banks. Monday’s settlements require approval by U.S. District Judge Paul Oetken. He had dismissed the lawsuit last September, but let the investors amend their complaint.

Dimon said that it was still early, but he expects most banks will add to cash reserves because economists now estimate the U.S. unemployment rate will rise to 18% by June 30, as businesses cannot yet rehire workers let go during the economic shutdown caused by the novel coronavirus. “Since CECL is very forward looking, I think that banks will have to put up a lot more credit reserves this quarter,” Dimon said, referring a new accounting rule that requires banks to take provisions now for loans a borrower may default on at any point. “We would have a substantial increase in credit reserves in the second quarter.” JPMorgan's first-quarter profits plunged by roughly two-thirds because it put aside $7 billion in reserves for outstanding loans to customers. reut.rs/2XBtsBO Speaking at a virtual conference hosted by Deutsche Bank, Dimon said that these builds in the bank’s credit reserve coffers are front-loaded and will likely taper off in the third and fourth quarters, when economists also expect the U.S. unemployment rate to fall closer to 10%.

Customers of the largest U.S. bank are spending more on their debit cards again, bringing 2020’s total spending levels back in line with that of 2019, Dimon said.

Bidders for the stake in Al Jazeera Agriculture Company include ADQ, formerly known as Abu Dhabi Development Holding and based in the capital of the United Arab Emirates, the sources said, adding ADQ was being advised by Rothschild & Co ROTH.PA. The UAE, which depends on imports for 80%-90% of its food, introduced a law in March to organize strategic food stocks for emergencies, the state news agency WAM reported, amid growing food security concerns due to the coronavirus crisis. Al Jazeera’s main products include fresh and frozen chicken for retail and wholesale, eggs, chicks and chicken feed, its website says. The sources did not give a value for Al Jazeera but said it had earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of about $40 million a year. Based on typical valuation multiples of 8 to 12 times EBITDA, the Jordanian firm could be worth in excess of $320 million. However, the coronavirus crisis has caused turmoil in financial markets, hammering corporate valuations. The sources said the crisis had slowed the sale but bidders were still active.

7.652278862164977," JPMorgan directors reelected, former Exxon executive overcomes opposition NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N shareholders voted to reelect all of the bank's board members on Tuesday, including a former Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N CEO who drew criticism from environmental groups and New York City's comptroller and pension system leader. Each director received support of at least 84% of investors' votes at the bank's annual meeting, conducted virtually due to the novel coronavirus pandemic. In April, JPMorgan said it will name a new independent director to replace former Exxon CEO Lee Raymond, 81, ""by end of summer 2020."" reut.rs/2SummMh The vote showed investors were willing to go along with JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon’s assertions that the bank can support green initiatives, while continuing financing deals with some fossil fuel companies. Raymond was targeted by critics who said his previous role leading a major oil company put him at odds with the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement, which Dimon said the bank supports. While none of the shareholder proposals won a majority of shares voted, one proposal got close with 49.6% of shares voted. The proposal asked the bank to report on whether and how it will align its lending business with the Paris agreement’s goal of limiting global temperature rise to below 2 degrees Celsius. Traditionally shareholder measures that receive more than 30% of support usually push companies to make at least some changes to assuage investor concerns. The bank also said on Tuesday that board directors James Bell, a retired executive vice president of Boeing Company, and Laban Jackson, CEO of Clear Creek Properties, were retiring."

18.153484731997306," JPMorgan's U.S. credit card holders spent 40% less due to coronavirus NEW YORK (Reuters) - Credit card spending among some of JP Morgan Chase & Co’s U.S. customers fell 40% during March and early April compared to last year, as Americans stayed home to protect against the novel coronavirus, according to a new report on Thursday. Spending on non-essential goods and services, like retail, restaurants, and entertainment, fell sharply across income brackets accounting for nearly all of the drop in spending during that period, the JP Morgan Chase Institute said. This is primarily due to the stay-at-home orders put in place by many U.S. states, and less due to job loss, at least for now, said Diana Farrell, president and chief executive of JPMorgan Chase Institute. “While surprising, we expect this may change over time as layoffs, furloughs and unemployment insurance further impact families’ bank accounts,” Farrell said in a statement. The overall fall in spending was 8 times larger than the average drop in household credit card spending in the first month of unemployment during regular times, according to the report. The global outbreak of the coronavirus has forced governments worldwide to impose lockdown orders to contain its rapid spread, crippling economic activity. In the United States, more than 32 million people have filed for unemployment benefits since March while consumer demand has also been hard hit. The U.S. Federal Reserve warned this week that the country will likely see weak economic growth for “an extended period”. The JPMorgan Chase Institute studied anonymized spending data from more than 8 million Chase credit card customers for the period from March 1 to April 11. Credit card users who report household incomes of less than $39,000 reduced spending by 38%, while wealthier cardholders, with incomes of more than $92,000, reduced spending by 46%. The group says the difference largely reflects higher average spending by wealthier households. The report showed essential spending, like on groceries and healthcare, initially spiked by 20% before falling back. Spending on non-essential things fell by 50% and dropped 70% on restaurants. The group tracked only spending on Chase credit cards, like its Slate, Sapphire and Ink cards. It did not track spending with cash, debit cards or other bank credit cards.

23.012681641473012," JPMorgan sees more Gulf companies linking up but no liquidity crunch DUBAI, May 13 (Reuters) - JPMorgan expects more consolidation among Gulf companies this year in sectors such as banking, real estate and hospitality, but it sees no liquidity crunch in the region, despite the twin blow of the new coronavirus and low oil prices. “We are going to continue to see consolidation themes building up on what we have witnessed in the previous years. I expect banking consolidation to continue its way through and to spill over in sectors such as real estate and hospitality,” said Karim Tannir, head of investment banking for the Middle East and North Africa and co-head of MENA at JPMorgan. The economic downturn in the Middle East is expected to be worse than the 2008/09 financial crisis and the 2014/15 oil price crash, the International Monetary Fund has said. But Tannir said the region had entered 2020 with strong finances and, after an initial phase of assessing liquidity needs, companies and governments are now looking more strategically at potential opportunities. “Unlike the 2008-2009 global financial crisis, we have gone into the current crisis with the corporates, the financial institutions and the government having more liquidity and stronger balance sheets, in a very low interest rate environment that has been low for a while,” he said. “Now that we have started moving out of assessing the operational impact, and the industrial impact of COVID 19, businesses are starting to have a clear view of their liquidity needs. The debate now will probably shift towards what strategic moves you can make and how to do that in the region.” JPMorgan was one of the top advisors of Saudi oil giant Aramco for its record-breaking initial public offering last year. This year, it has worked with the governments of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Abu Dhabi, and Bahrain on over $30 billion in international bond issues. Governments and companies in the Gulf are expected to borrow heavily this year to offset the impact of low oil prices. Abu Dhabi’s state fund Mubadala raised $4 billion in bonds this week. “I cannot say if this year will be record year in terms of debt issuance from the region, but it’s going to be intense,” Tannir said.

19.433639994159726," UBS seeks wealth management boost with JPMorgan hire and new Russia head ZURICH, May 12 (Reuters) - UBS is seeking to boost its wealth management business in Russia and the broader central and eastern Europe region with a senior hire from JPMorgan and a new head of wealth management for Russia. The Swiss lender has hired Elena Griffin, JPMorgan’s head of wealth management for Russia, to become vice chair of the Central and Eastern Europe, Greece and Israel region and has promoted Ekaterina Lehmann to become head of global wealth management in Russia, it said in a memo seen by Reuters and confirmed by the bank. Through Griffin’s appointment, the world’s biggest wealth manager hopes to extend its business with family offices -- privately held groups which coordinate investments and advise the world’s richest families on their wealth -- in the region led by Caroline Kuhnert. “During her 11 years with JP Morgan, Elena built a very strong franchise focusing on billionaire clients from the region,” Kuhnert and global family office (GFO) head Joe Stadler said in a joint memo. “Her exceptional track record and strong networks will allow us to broaden and strengthen our GFO business in the markets she serves.” Griffin, recently announced to lead JPMorgan’s private banking and wealth management business for international clients in New York, will join UBS at the beginning of July. Lehmann, now head of the UBS’s global family office and ultra-high-net-worth clients for Russia and surrounding countries in the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS), will lead wealth management in both Russia and CIS countries.

The company will adopt a phased-in approach when staff do return to working in offices, a strategy it has already started at some places in Asia, according to the email, which was verified by a JPMorgan spokesman. Like most global banks, more than 90% of the JPMorgan’s staff have been working from home or remotely since at least March due to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus. While countries are beginning to take steps to re-open businesses to staff and customers, the top executives of the New York-headquartered bank said they will continue to take a cautious approach. “We are still facing a global pandemic and the lifting of restrictions is just one important piece of being in a position to return employees safely to the office,” according to the memo sent by the bank’s operating committee. “However, we must have the right processes, protocols and practices in place before more employees return. This will take some time.” The bank is enhancing security and health protocols for people entering its buildings and re-arranging desks and changing how people access cafes and elevators to ensure that people stand six feet apart, according to the memo.

4.060527144760786," Climate activists claim win as JPMorgan sets timetable for new lead director (Reuters) - New York City’s pension fund leader claimed a win on Friday after JPMorgan Chase & Co set a timetable to replace its lead independent director, a former Exxon Mobil Corp CEO who had become the focus of criticism of the bank’s climate record. The director, Lee Raymond, who is up for re-election at the bank’s annual meeting on May 19, had earlier asked the board to start a formal process to find a successor for the lead independent director role, JPMorgan said previously. But in a securities filing on Thursday JPMorgan said it plans to name a new lead independent director “by end of summer 2020.” A JPMorgan spokesman declined to comment beyond the language in the filings. New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer, who oversees the city’s pension fund and whose office last month began a campaign to vote out Raymond, in a statement sent by a spokeswoman called the change “a tremendous victory for shareholders and for the planet.” Stringer’s office in its campaign against Raymond had cited JPMorgan’s lending to fossil fuel companies and Raymond’s long tenure on JPMorgan’s board. Raymond has been on the board of JPMorgan and a predecessor since 1987. Institutional Shareholder Services on Thursday had recommended investors back all JPMorgan directors, but called its support for Raymond “cautionary” in order “to convey that additional, new independent oversight is necessary as the process to find his successor unfolds.”[nL1N2CJ03L]"
4.060527144760786," JPMorgan Chase approved to process $15 billion in new PPP loans NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co said on Friday that the U.S. Small Business Administration gave it the green light to make $15 billion in new loans to some 211,000 business customers hurt by the outbreak of the novel coronavirus. The largest U.S. bank said it expects to process a total of $29 billion in loans for around 239,000 customers as part of the government’s Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). The average of these loans is for $123,000, according to a press release. Congress gave the Small Business Administration (SBA) nearly $660 billion over the past two months for government-guaranteed, forgivable loans that businesses hurt by the epidemic could apply for at participating banks. Faced with high demand from many of the country’s roughly 30 million small businesses, the program’s success was hindered by technology failures, a lack of clarity on the rules and paperwork required, and by banks’ struggles to quickly launch platforms to process the high volume of loan requests. “Thousands of dedicated (staff) worked tirelessly over the past 30+ days to support the federal government in one of the largest and most ambitious emergency lending facilities in history,” JPMorgan Chairman and Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said in a statement. Big banks have faced criticism from policymakers for approving loans to businesses considered to be at the larger end of the small businesses range. This fueled concerns that the program’s funds would be exhausted before smaller, needier companies could apply. Congress attempted to address this concern this week by ring-fencing $30 billion for banks with less than $10 billion in assets. But pent-up demand meant those funds were exhausted by Tuesday. For its part, JPMorgan said on Friday that half of the PPP loans it processed went to companies with fewer than 5 employees, and 75% of the loans were for less than $100,000. “We’ve followed (the government’s) direction to deploy this relief as quickly as possible and agree with their tightening of eligibility requirements so that funding goes to those that need it most,” Chief Executive of Chase Business Banking Jennifer Roberts said in a statement."

3.1255425117136006," JPMorgan poaches Citi's Torun to build up senior Paris ranks LONDON (Reuters) - JPMorgan JPM.N is betting on a female banker to take the reins of its investment banking business in France as it seeks to bolster its leadership in one of Europe's hardest-hit markets from the coronavirus pandemic. The Wall Street bank has snapped up Citigroup's C.N co-head of France investment banking, Maja Torun, to take on a similar job at the helm of its own franchise, according to a memo sent to staff which confirmed an earlier Reuters report. Torun, who will start her new role in July, will also join the bank’s France management committee. The move comes as big banks and corporate boardrooms in Europe are trying to fill the gender gap and open up more top jobs for women. JPMorgan kept a focus on diversity during its latest leadership reshuffling in February when it promoted two female bankers, Dorothee Blessing and Anu Aiyengar, to two power-sharing roles as co-head of EMEA investment banking and co-head of global M&A, respectively. In her new Paris-based role Torun will be part of a small circle of female banking leaders in the French capital which also includes BNP Paribas’ Sophie Javary, Goldman Sachs’s Anne Bizien and Citi’s Laurence Parisot. JPMorgan’s France boss Kyril Courboin, who sent out the memo, said that Torun will mainly focus on deepening the bank’s client franchise while working in close partnership with its existing senior team. But Torun’s appointment comes with the challenge of a bleak economic environment, with France bracing for a series of rescue deals, nationalizations and restructurings in the coming months. The French economy sank 6% in the first quarter of 2020 in its sharpest slowdown since World War Two. The novel coronavirus has forced the country into a prolonged lockdown, paralysing business activity and claiming more than 23,000 lives. Torun, a specialist in mergers and acquisitions (M&A) who joined Citi in 2016 from Deutsche Bank, will lead JPMorgan’s efforts to win business from cash-strapped companies seeking help to stay afloat and fend off pressure from a growing number of activist investors in France. She fills a vacant role that will reunite her with a former Deutsche Bank colleague, Marc Pandraud, who has chaired JPMorgan’s investment banking for France and Belgium since 2016. Torun first met Pandraud at Merrill Lynch where they both worked before the financial crisis forced the bank into a rescue merger with Bank of America BAC.N. She then rose through the ranks quickly at Citi, winning the top job as the bank's co-head of France investment banking alongside Emmanuel Regniez in 2019 and leaving her mark after Citi topped up M&A league tables in France last year ahead of Goldman Sachs GS.N and Morgan Stanley. Torun worked on some of France’s most prominent deals in recent years including the merger of Essilor and Luxottica and Publicis’s acquisition of Epsilon. Conor Hillery, who co-heads JPMorgan’s EMEA investment banking unit, praised her ability to “build trust with clients naturally,” saying she was a “first class adviser.” Torun, who holds an MBA from French business school INSEAD, will report to both Kyril Courboin, who runs France as senior country officer, and Tanguy Piret, who heads the banking business across France, Belgium and Luxembourg."

JPMorgan is the first big bank to announce steps to return to normal as debate grows over reopening the U.S. economy after the novel coronavirus shuttered businesses across the country and put a record 22 million people out of work. “Two considerations are paramount as we plan for this across the firm: We want to do it at the right time — which may differ by region, country and state — and in a manner that prioritizes your health and safety,” the bank’s Operating Committee said in the memo. Around 180,000 of JPMorgan’s more than 200,000 employees have been working from home, with around 25% of its bank branches closed, in an effort to protect employees from the virus, bank executives said last week. The bank said on Tuesday it does not have a firm timeline for when it will return employees to offices, but that it will follow guidance from government and health authorities and take into consideration concerns over public transportation and school reopenings. Wall Street banks sent workers home in mid-March to help stem the spread of the virus, but that has proved disruptive for some heavily regulated or technology-intensive functions, such as trading and other compliance roles. President Donald Trump has pressed states to begin easing restrictions on non-essential businesses amid worries the economic fallout will hurt his re-election chances. Some states, though, are resisting that pressure, with New York City, home to JPMorgan’s headquarters, locked down until May 15. Health experts have criticized the White House’s push to re-open the economy without widespread virus testing, while the World Health Organization warned on Tuesday that lifting lockdowns must be gradual or populations risk a resurgence in cases. While JPMorgan’s memo did not specifically address testing, Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said earlier this month that companies could get employees back to work faster if the government provided them with tests, including antibody tests. Congress agreed to provide $25 billion for more nationwide testing on Tuesday as part of a $500 billion coronavirus relief package.

Americans stand to receive payments of up to $1,200 each as part of Congress’ $2.2 trillion aid package meant to stem the fallout from the novel coronavirus outbreak that has shuttered businesses and left more than 10 million people unemployed. The first wave of the payments began to hit bank accounts through direct deposits this week. JPMorgan Chase & Co, Bank of America Corp and Wells Fargo & Co are pausing collection on negative balances or offering temporary credits to customers who have overdrawn their accounts. Without the relief, the payments would be reduced by the amount of the negative balance, which can include hefty overdraft fees. The number of checking-account customers with negative balances varies widely each day and often peaks at the end of months, when people face bills, and falls on common paydays, like the 15th. “We hope this gives them a chance to catch their breath,” JPMorgan spokeswoman Anne Pace said.

The results painted a grim picture at the start of a long, tough period for lenders, with Chief Executive Jamie Dimon saying the economy was facing a “fairly severe” recession because of the economic shutdown caused by the coronavirus. “If the economy gets worse, we’ll bear additional loss,” Dimon said on a call with analysts. “But we do forecast all of that. We know we can handle really adverse consequences.” That tone was repeated by the No. 3 U.S. bank, Wells Fargo & Co, which also reported profits plunged as it boosted reserves in the first quarter. In total, JPMorgan recorded charges worth $8.3 billion in the first quarter, mostly due to money the bank set aside to cover loans. JPMorgan also reported a $951 million-loss on derivatives and an $896-million markdown on its bridge loans. The bank’s shares were down about 3% in mid-day trading. JPMorgan’s chief financial officer, Jennifer Piepszak, that the bank may “meaningfully” increase the amount it is holding in credit reserves next quarter and later in the year if the economy worsens. “We haven’t actually seen the stress emerge yet,” Piepszak said. “What we took in the first quarter is our best estimate of future losses. It is our best estimate of the losses that will inevitably emerge through this crisis.” The reserves included $4.5 billion against potential consumer loan defaults as millions of Americans lose their jobs and struggle to make payments on anything from iPhones to cars to new microwaves. A new accounting rule requires banks to take provisions now if a borrower may default at any point during the agreement, even if that is months or years away. Revenue at three of its four main businesses were down, although trading proved to be a bright spot in an otherwise dismal quarter. JPMorgan’s investment bank was hurt by a near-total halt in M&A activity and underwriting, with the exception of investment-grade debt.

The bank’s net interest income stayed flat at $14.5 billion as lower interest rates were offset by higher net interest income from its investment banking business. It forecast annual net interest income of $55.5 billion. The bank’s net income fell to $2.87 billion, or 78 cents per share, in the quarter ended March 31, compared with $9.18 billion, or $2.65 per share, a year earlier. Analysts on average had expected $1.84 per share, according to Refinitiv. It was not immediately clear if the reported numbers were comparable with estimates. One month ago, analysts had estimated that JPMorgan would make $2.74 per share, according to Refinitiv data. The additional reserves, largely as a result of COVID-19, reduced results by $1.66 per share, JPMorgan said. “While a couple of critical issues like future reserves & run rate revenues ... will help shape the picture on what to do with JPM ... at first look we think 1Q20 results will be good enough to keep JPM remain profitable,” Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr wrote in a note to investors on Tuesday.

0.4191374246711628," Trading gains for big U.S. banks may not last past first quarter NEW YORK (Reuters) - Big U.S. banks made a pretty penny in trading during the first quarter as the coronavirus pandemic caused wild market swings, analysts said, but those gains will likely be overshadowed by declines in other businesses and a bleak outlook for the rest of the year. Trading revenue could be up from 8% to 20% when the five big Wall Street banks – JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, Bank of America Corp BAC.N, Citigroup Inc C.N, Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N and Morgan Stanley MS.N – report results this week, according to five estimates gathered by Reuters. A note of caution was sounded by a sixth, Chris Kotowski of Oppenheimer & Co, who penciled in double-digit revenue declines for some banks because “these kinds of markets almost always lead to some trading inventory losses.” Nonetheless, Kotowski favors banks with heavy exposure to trading, betting they will fare better than those with large lending businesses. That dark optimism reflects the state of banking today. Bread-and-butter businesses that take in, lend out, process and manage money for individuals and companies are struggling as the novel coronavirus has infected hundreds of thousands of people in the United States alone, shut down businesses and set the stage for a global recession. (tmsnrt.rs/2RqR9sT) Shifting updates about the novel coronavirus and government responses during the first quarter created volatility that allowed trading businesses to perform well, analysts said. Stock markets plunged and soared day-to-day in a manner not seen in at least a decade, while bond markets reacted to the U.S. Federal Reserve’s cutting interest rates and pouring trillions of dollars into financial markets to address liquidity issues. Teams that handle stocks, Treasury bonds and foreign-exchange swaps likely did better than those in corporate credit, where there was severe stress at times, analysts said. Average daily volumes on Tradeweb Markets Inc TW.O, which operates electronic trading platforms for fixed income and equities, were up 39% in the quarter from a year earlier, the company reported. But activity began dissipating by late March, and few expect it to return as the year goes on. “Good temporary news for the big banks is trading was really good in 1Q,” Evercore ISI analyst Glenn Schorr said in a recent report. The last time Wall Street banks experienced this kind of dynamic was the first quarter of 2009. Investors were worried that banks were in serious trouble, only to learn that government stimulus programs had created a trading boon, which held up through most of that year. But coronavirus volatility may turn out to be quite different, analysts said. Banks have dramatically restructured their trading businesses since then, and bursts of trading activity have become much more fleeting, even when they are extreme. “If we look back to, like, 2Q ‘18 when we had that sharp market correction, it took several quarters in a good economy for that trading activity to come back,” Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck said in an interview. “With this economy it’s going to take a little bit longer.”"
-1.0000035962387896," Exclusive: JPMorgan Chase to raise mortgage borrowing standards as economic outlook darkens NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, the country's largest lender by assets, is raising borrowing standards this week for most new home loans as the bank moves to mitigate lending risk stemming from the novel coronavirus disruption. From Tuesday, customers applying for a new mortgage will need a credit score of at least 700, and will be required to make a down payment equal to 20% of the home’s value. The change highlights how banks are quickly shifting gears to respond to the darkening U.S. economic outlook and stress in the housing market, after measures to contain the virus put 16 million people out of work and plunged the country into recession. “Due to the economic uncertainty, we are making temporary changes that will allow us to more closely focus on serving our existing customers,” Amy Bonitatibus, chief marketing officer for JPMorgan Chase’s home lending business, told Reuters. The bank was the fourth largest U.S. mortgage lender in 2019, according to industry publication Inside Mortgage Finance. The changes should help JPMorgan reduce its exposure to borrowers who unexpectedly lose their job, suffer a decline in wages, or whose homes lose value. The bank said the change will also free up staff to handle a surge in mortgage refinance requests, which are taking longer to process due to staff working from home and non-essential businesses being closed. Refinancing requests jumped to their highest level in more than a decade last month as average rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages, the most popular home loan, fell to near record lows, according to data from the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA). JPMorgan would not disclose the current minimum requirements for its various mortgage products, but the average down payment across the housing market is around 10%, according to the MBA. The new credit standards do not apply to JPMorgan’s roughly four million existing mortgage customers, or to low and moderate income borrowers who qualify for its “DreaMaker” product, which requires a minimum 3% down payment and 620 credit score. The U.S. housing market had been on a steady footing earlier this year, but with a deepening recession and would-be home buyers unable to view properties or close purchases due to social distancing measures, the health crisis now threatens to derail the sector. The residential mortgage market is already under strain after borrower requests to delay mortgage payments rose 1,900% in the second half of March, Reuters reported. The National Association of Realtors last month said home sales could fall by around 10% in the short-term, compared to historical sales for this time of year. A Federal Reserve March consumer survey said home prices were expected grow 1.32% over the year, the lowest reading since the survey began in 2013."
-10.306081014623864," Exclusive: JPMorgan looking to offload Saudi and UAE sovereign fund loans - sources DUBAI (Reuters) - JPMorgan JPM.N is seeking to sell at a discount loans raised by the sovereign wealth funds of Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, according to two sources and a document, as banks brace for a borrowing spree in the Gulf due to low oil prices. Banks tend to hold loans they grant to Gulf governments in their portfolios, only selling down their exposure quietly through bilateral transactions as they don’t want to be seen as dumping the paper in the market, two banking sources said. This helps them maintain good relationships with the borrowers in light of future funding requests, but with loans raised by oil-rich Gulf states generally trading at par value, there are also few incentives for other banks to buy them in the secondary market. However, as Gulf government and state entities seek to raise funds after the recent plunge in oil prices and the coronavirus pandemic strained budgets, banks have been trying to make room for new borrowing requests by selling down some of their exposure, the two sources said. JPMorgan this week tried to sell down loans it has made to Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund (PIF) and Abu Dhabi’s Mubadala, among a few other regional names, according to a loan document known as axe sheet, seen by Reuters. The bank was considering selling at least $50 million of PIF loan paper due in 2023 at an indicative price of 98.75 cents on the dollar, and at least 70 million euros of Mubadala loans at 99 cents on the dollar, the document showed. JPMorgan and Mubadala declined to comment, while PIF did not respond to a request for comment. Other banks with large exposures to Gulf governments have also tried to offload loans over the past few weeks, a Gulf-based source said. “Everyone wants money these days and we can’t give everyone money,” said the source, speaking anonymously due to commercial sensitivities. “Even if you put aside the current market environment, this is a region which has seen an increase in borrowing requests over the past few years so we need to make room.” The source stressed that the sale of the loans was not a sign of a change in the creditors’ financial condition, with repayments due as per the agreements. The PIF debt JPMorgan has been trying to sell is part of an $11 billion debut syndicated loan the sovereign wealth fund raised in 2018 from 15 banks, including the U.S. lender. Gulf states have borrowed tens of billions of dollars since oil prices collapsed in 2014/2015, taking advantage of low global rates to refill their oil-dependent state coffers, with Saudi Arabia alone borrowing more than $100 billion through loans and bonds over the past few years. “Generally the expectation this year is there will be a lot of asks for the region ... so you make room ahead of that,” the source said. PIF - the investment fund at the centre of Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman’s plans to diversify the Saudi economy - raised an additional $10 billion loan last year. Some banks were hesitant to participate in that deal given the low interest rate on offer and in light of their already big exposure to Saudi entities, sources have told Reuters. [nL8N24Q55B]"

The German airline is culling a portion of its fleet – an admission that demand for air travel will take years to return to pre-coronavirus levels. That’s in marked contrast to previous crises. After the 2003 SARS outbreak, Hong Kong’s Cathay Pacific Airways, the worst-hit carrier, was almost back to normal in three months. Lufthansa’s move means aviation’s hoped-for V-shaped recovery is rapidly becoming more U-like and may even end up as an L. By decommissioning 42 aircraft, including 20% of its wide-body fleet, the company is accepting it will be a dramatically smaller carrier. That has profound implications for suppliers. The giant Airbus A380 superjumbo and Boeing’s 747 long-haul workhorse were already headed for the scrap-heap due to high running costs. But short-haul crafts like the A320 were not. The 30-billion-euro question is what happens to the 200 aircraft Lufthansa had on order. (By Ed Cropley) JPMORGAN’S FAT-FINGERED NEAR-MISS. Investors may be feeling calmer about U.S. bank earnings after the confidence Jamie Dimon exuded in his letter to shareholders on Monday. But imagine their momentary panic after receiving a note later in the day from the bank he runs with a link to first-quarter results that weren’t due for another week. It isn’t the first time a company, or its third-party provider, has hit send early on earnings. In fact, over the past 15 years the likes of Microsoft, Walt Disney, Google (pre-Alphabet), and Sony Ericsson all committed such boo-boos, sending out their numbers up to a day in advance. JPMorgan made a similar mistake in 2014. Luckily, JPMorgan’s mistake simply included the wrong words and a link that didn’t work, rather than the numbers themselves.

Remember the app that shot to fame a decade ago for consumers to share locations and win virtual prizes? Far larger social networks like Facebook and Twitter drowned it out. Privately owned Foursquare, co-founded by Dennis Crowley, is still around, though focuses on helping advertisers find customers based on where they are. Now it’s making some noise merging with rival Factual. The two are small, with $150 million of combined revenue last year. If valued on the same multiple as some of their larger peers, Foursquare-Factual would be worth less than $1 billion. Even that may be a stretch for a while. After all, location-based advertising loses virtually all appeal in a near-nationwide pandemic-enforced lockdown. (By Robert Cyran) THE CHIC OF IT. Designer Kurt Geiger is gifting 5 million pounds of fashion to British health workers. The brand is aiming to get at least 1,000 pairs of shoes to the National Health Service frontline every week. Chief Executive Neil Clifford, who suspended his salary until shops reopen, said the chain can’t make significant financial donations. But high heels are probably not the accessories dedicated hospital staff need amid a shortage of life-saving protective equipment. Still, the move allows owner Cinven to stay out of the private equity sin bin. Thanks to help from its bank, Lloyds Banking, Kurt Geiger says it’s continuing to pay its employees while stores are closed. This will eat into the buyout fund’s returns, particularly as its four years holding the asset are likely to be extended. Cinven is setting other buyout barons a stylish example to follow.

Originally, 45% of American Dream’s square footage was to be dedicated to retailers like Saks Fifth Avenue. Owners Triple Five reduced that to 30%. American Dream’s part-launch was bold to begin with but now looks especially troubled. Shoppers may find they’re more drawn to experiences as they emerge from quarantine, rather than just destination buying, especially as online buying habits are cemented. But that pits American Dream against Walt Disney and Six Flags Entertainment theme parks. American Dream will need to live up to its billing as a destination attracting people globally to its SpongeBob-themed roller-coaster, ski slope and water park. That’s a costly mission with no guarantee of success. Triple Five may be better off repurposing some of that space to warehouse or ventilator factory. (By Jen Saba) UNDESERVING. Luxury mega-brands like LVMH and Kering, owned by two of France’s richest men, are bracing for a whopping Covid-19 hit. With stores closed across the United States and Europe, Goldman Sachs expects sector sales to contract 30% in 2020. That’s three times as bad as in 2009. But it still doesn’t give the duo an excuse to rein in costs by tapping state-backed job support schemes in countries like France, as a report by the Financial Times suggested they were tempted to do. Years of strong cash flow have helped bling players build strong balance sheets, with average net debt below one year’s EBITDA. Moncler, Kering and Richemont have more than 10 months of liquidity to cover the current cash burn, say RBC analysts. And the sector should experience a 15% sales bounceback in 2021, Goldman reckons.

Following bouts of major M&A, chains are typically highly leveraged: AMC had net debt of 6 times EBITDA last year. The industry can’t rule out a scary sequel. The Covid-19 villain can make a comeback and the growing trend of watching films at home will keep bums away from movie theatre seats. In the United Kingdom, total cinema revenue fell last year.

Even before coronavirus grounded fleets worldwide, Malaysia Airlines was an indebted, bloated Asian state carrier looking for a buyer.

They told Reuters they wanted to reinvent the airline as a premium long-haul operator and were even willing to let the government keep its golden share. A promise to retain all 13,000 frontline employees and not strip out assets will also be music to Kuala Lumpur’s ears.

7.227491988784021," JPMorgan CEO Dimon calls 'bad recession', mulls suspending 2020 dividend (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co's top boss, Jamie Dimon JPM.N, on Monday said he sees a ""bad recession"" in 2020, and that the largest U.S. bank could suspend its dividend if the coronavirus crisis deepens. Dimon, widely regarded as the face of the U.S. banking sector, is the most prominent voice on Wall Street so far to project that the economic cost of the coronavirus will not evaporate quickly, and said the bank’s earnings will be down “meaningfully in 2020.” But, Dimon said, even in the worst case scenario, the bank is strong and will continue lending to customers and will not need any relief from the federal government. JPMorgan’s stock was up 5% to $84.05 in morning trading. JPMorgan could look at suspending dividends if gross domestic product were to fall by as much as 35% in the second quarter and the unemployment rate were to rise further to 14% in the fourth quarter of the year, the chief executive officer wrote in his annual letter to shareholders. Questions are mounting about whether big U.S. banks will have to cut dividends later this year as the coronavirus crisis puts a record portion of Americans out of work, making it difficult for borrowers to pay back loans. “If the board suspended the dividend, it would be out of extreme prudence and based upon continued uncertainty over what the next few years will bring,” Dimon said. Dimon highlighted some challenges seen at the bank’s call centers, where a handful of staff have fallen ill, customer call volumes are at record highs and local restrictions have effectively shuttered some offices. For customers hurt by the crisis, the bank is offering a 90-day grace period to make mortgage and auto loan payments, removing minimum payment requirements on credit cards, and waiving any late fees for those types of accounts, according to the letter. Dimon also said that the vast majority of the bank’s 16,850 ATMs were “well-stocked and still functioning” to provide cash for customers. The bank said it had extended about $950 million in new loans to small businesses over the last 60 days and would still extend credit to small businesses. “In both our central case scenario for 2020 results and in our extremely adverse scenario, we are lending – currently or plan to do so – an additional $150 billion for our clients’ needs,” Dimon said. Even with that lending, Dimon wrote JPMorgan currently has over $500 billion in total liquid assets and $300 billion in incremental borrowing capacity from the Federal Reserve and Federal Home Loan Banks. Dimon did not pass up the opportunity to suggest regulatory and fiscal policy reform, as he has often done in past annual letters. “After the crisis subsides (and it will), our country should thoroughly review all aspects of our preparedness and response. And we should use the opportunity to closely review the economic response and determine whether any additional regulatory changes are warranted to improve our financial and economic system. There will be a time and place for that – but not now.” JPMorgan will also nominate former International Business Machines Corp IBM.N CEO Virginia ""Ginni"" Rometty for election to its board. Rometty will become the executive chairman of IBM on April 6."

In his annual letter to shareholders, Dimon also highlighted several challenges that the largest U.S bank is currently facing, saying that the bank’s call centers have struggled in the current environment, with many of them effectively shutting down due to local restrictions. “We are working closely with all levels of government during this crisis — and while we will participate in government programs to address the severe economic challenges, we will not request any regulatory relief for ourselves,” Dimon said.

11.698787525484036," U.S. pension funds may pour $400 billion into stocks, lifting virus-hit markets: JP Morgan NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. pension funds that delayed rebalancing their portfolios are likely to pump about $400 billion into stocks over the next two quarters, analysts at JP Morgan said, providing a potential boost to equity markets battered by the coronavirus pandemic. Weeks of asset price volatility may have pushed some fund managers to postpone rebalancing portfolios where equity allocations have been knocked out of whack by a sharp decline in stocks, the bank said in a note to investors. The S&P 500 fell 20% since the start of the year, marking its worst quarter since 2008. “We still expect that US pension funds will eventually rebalance within 1-2 quarters,” wrote strategist Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou. The bank said its estimate of $400 billion in equity buying by the funds over the next two quarters could prove conservative. U.S. pension funds bought $200 billion in stocks by the first quarter of 2009, in the aftermath of the global financial crisis -- equivalent to $600 billion today, the bank said. Wild market swings have presented a challenge to asset managers looking to square their portfolios against a benchmark or return to their long-maintained allocation of stocks versus bonds. While the S&P is down about 24% from its February highs, unprecedented support from the Federal Reserve and a $2.2 trillion relief package from U.S. lawmakers helped stocks rally 15.5% since March 23. At least one fund -- the Los Angeles City Employees’ Retirement System, which oversees some $15 billion -- is allowing its rebalancing to be deferred, according to a report in Pensions & Investments. The fund did not immediately respond turn a request for comment. Brian Reynolds, chief market strategist with Reynolds Strategy, said in a note this week a rebalancing that leads pensions to sell bonds and buy stocks “makes no sense for pensions given the capital calls they are facing from credit and related products.” Some index providers, such as S&P Dow Jones Indices, have delayed their quarterly rebalancing due to the market volatility, potentially complicating the picture for funds that look to track index performance. Last week’s rally in stocks may have helped boost some funds’ equity allocations, making the need to increase exposure less acute, said Mike Schumacher, head of macro strategy at Wells Fargo Securities. The bank last week had estimated that U.S. corporate pensions will need to shift about $40 billion from fixed income into equities to maintain allocation targets. Its estimate now stands at $20 billion following last week’s rally, Schumacher said. At the same time, mutual funds, pensions and other asset managers rebalancing their portfolio may have stoked some of last week’s gains. Steven DeSanctis, an equity strategist at Jefferies, said moves from fixed income into equities “most likely” happened last week, adding that “the rebalancings don’t have to take place on the 31st.” Jack Janasiewicz, portfolio strategist at Natixis Investment Managers Solutions, said some of the market’s recent gains have come from quarter-end and month-end rebalancing. “Once we get through the next couple of days, it’s going to be a little bit more interesting because the question then becomes, ‘Do we return really back to fundamentals and technicals?’.”"
5.561954208357571," JPMorgan, addressing racism allegations, reforms customer complaint system, access NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N told employees on Tuesday it is changing its customer complaint system and how staff choose which customers are eligible for certain banking products after the New York Times reported allegations of racial discrimination against black customers at the bank last year. The reports prompted the bank to “look at how we do business so that we could gain a deeper understanding of what more we can do to root out racism and discrimination,” co-Chief Executives Gordon Smith and Daniel Pinto wrote in a memo sent to the bank’s staff seen by Reuters and verified by a bank spokesman. In December, the New York Times reported instances of racial discrimination at the bank’s branches in the Phoenix, Arizona, area, citing audio recordings made by a bank employee and a customer as evidence. “We are looking across the whole firm and at everything we do. We’ve identified a number of areas that, with enhanced, scaled or new programming or processes, would serve to improve our culture in important ways,” Smith and Pinto wrote. The bank will simplify the process through which employees file customer complaints and flag serious concerns to senior management. It is also re-evaluating the qualification requirements for new products and benefits and will strengthen tools bank managers use to monitor employees who have discretion over which customers get access to certain products and benefits. The bank also committed to recruiting more diverse staff and said it will expand assessment programs for managers that evaluate how successfully they recruit for and hire diverse employees in management."

The bank plans to raise $5 billion to $10 billion in the next couple of months from clients including pension funds, sovereign-wealth funds, family offices and private banks, according to the source. The biggest U.S. bank by assets already has about $10 billion of client capital that it plans to use on opportunities created by the market disruption in the wake of the outbreak. That amount has roughly $3 billion earmarked for credit, $3 billion for real estate and $4 billion across transportation and infrastructure. The pandemic has sent global financial markets into a tailspin, knocking $7 trillion off the value of S&P 500 companies and raising fears of a deep global recession. JPMorgan said on Saturday it expected real U.S. gross domestic product to fall 10% in the first quarter and plunge 25% in the second quarter.

18.35495420796368," JPMorgan Chase to pay 'front-line' workers $1,000 bonus: memo NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N said Friday it would give ""front line employees,"" workers who are staffing branches and call centers through the coronavirus pandemic, a sweetener for their efforts: a one-time $1,000 bonus. The largest U.S. bank by assets, which closed 1,000 of its roughly 5,000 branches this week, said full- and part-time staff who have to do their jobs from an office or branch, and who make less than $60,000 a year or are based at a consumer banking branch, are eligible to receive the payments, according to a memo sent by the bank’s operating committee. The move comes as banks struggle to meet the dual demands of remaining open for customers who need cash and other banking services and keeping employees satisfied as many are asked to keep working as usual, despite the frightening global pandemic. Earlier this week, JPMorgan announced it was closing about 20% of its U.S. branches, as it worked to reduce its staff’s possible exposure to the flu-like virus. The bank also tried to make going into the office a bit more palatable by relaxing the dress code for employees of the community and consumer bank who do not work in branches, such as call center employees. The bank is also giving all employees up to five new paid days away from work, as well as allowing people to carry over unused vacation time from 2019 until June, as a way to “help employees manage childcare/dependent care and temporary disruption of service issues during this difficult period,” according to the memo. Employees will get the one-time payment announced on Friday in two, $500 installments to be paid out in April and May."
15.8574335685848," JPMorgan Chase to close 1,000 Chase branches on coronavirus concerns (This March 18 story corrects in seventh paragraph to clarify dress code is relaxed for operations staff but not Chase branch staff) (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase and Co JPM.N will temporarily shut about 1,000 bank branches, roughly 20%, to protect employees and reduce the spread of the coronavirus, according to a memo the bank sent to employees Wednesday. Beginning Thursday, the bank’s remaining roughly 4,000 branches will be open as usual but operating on reduced hours, as JPMorgan Chase becomes the first national lender to temporarily close operations as a precaution against the escalating health crisis. Many of the branches remaining open have drive-through windows and glass partitions separating the bank teller from customers, the bank said. The bank said it will pay its branch employees for their regularly scheduled hours, even if the hours they work are reduced or the branch where they work is closed. Financial advisers, small-business bankers and home-lending advisers will start working from home on Thursday. Private client, relationship and business bankers will also get a one-time financial incentive for March, April and May. The bank is also offering free meals to employees of the community and consumer banking division who work in offices where there is an on-site cafeteria and free lunch on Thursdays for branch employees. The bank also loosened the dress code for its operations staff, like call center employees, allowing those workers to wear T-shirts and sneakers to work. Branch employees and operations staff will also get two additional paid days off for the year. Thasunda Duckett, chief executive officer of Chase Consumer Banking, said that the bank is balancing “the fact that we are essential to the communities we serve” with the need to protect employees. “We are doing everything we can to step up for our country, our customers and for all of you,” Duckett wrote in the memo. Chase is also stepping up cleaning at branches and will send a specialized cleaning team to a branch within an hour if they report a “confirmed or highly likely COVID-19 case,” according to the memo."

It also announced it would access funding from the Federal Reserve’s so-called “discount window,” and that it was closing 1,000 Chase branches to allow more staff to work from home and avoid the fast-spreading virus. Dimon had emergency heart surgery on March 5 to repair a tear to his aorta. The aorta is usually replaced with a synthetic tube, and recovery can generally take around seven to eight weeks.

The impact on Latin America (-12%) and Europe, Middle East and Africa (-13%) is expected to mark the biggest single-quarter declines in these regions since 2008-09 in the coming months. Turkey’s 17.2% and Mexico’s 15.5% q/q annualized growth collapse is likely to be the largest in emerging markets in the second quarter with central and eastern European economies not far behind. Some of the biggest losses are seen in EMEA EM where aggressive social distancing measures and Euro area linkages are expected to cause a permanent loss of 3%-pts in the level of economic output this year. In Latin America, Colombia, Brazil and Mexico are expected to suffer the largest GDP hits for the year as a whole, all close to 3%-pts on 4Q/4Q basis, the bank added."
19.165711700658765," Brazil sliding into deep, coronavirus-linked recession in 2020: Goldman, JPMorgan BRASILIA (Reuters) - Economists at Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan said on Wednesday they expected Brazil’s economy to tip into recession this year as the global coronavirus pandemic pummels demand, investment and trade. Goldman Sachs slashed its 2020 growth forecast to -0.9% from 1.5% only two weeks ago, while JP Morgan went further to predict that Latin America’s largest economy will shrink by 1.0%. These are among the most gloomy outlooks for Brazil among the world’s big banks, most of which had estimated growth of between 2.0 and 2.5% at the start of the year. The reversals were prompted by the scale of the coronavirus shock. “Global and domestic dynamics take a turn for the worse. Recession seems unavoidable,” said JP Morgan economists in a note on Wednesday. The forecasts came the same day Brazil’s central bank cut interest rates by 50 basis points to a new low of 3.75%. Some economists had said the scale of the crisis merited a 100 basis point cut, like the U.S. Federal Reserve delivered on Sunday. Goldman Sachs’ economists noted that enforced social distancing and job losses will hit private consumption, while the “signiﬁcant” increase in economic uncertainty and tightening of ﬁnancial conditions will hurt investment. Goldman said it now expected the Latin American economy to shrink 1.2% this year, compared with its previous call of 1.1% growth. It cut Mexico’s outlook down to -1.6% from +0.6%."
19.165711700658765," JP Morgan economist says U.S. GDP could drop 14% in second-quarter SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - The U.S. economy could shrink 14% next quarter, a JP Morgan economist said on Wednesday, one of the most dire calls yet on the potential hit to the United States from the coronavirus epidemic. A drop of that size would be steeper than in the fourth quarter of 2008 - the worst of the Great Recession - when the economy shrank 8.4%. That is assuming the Federal Reserve will continue to find “creative” ways to support the economy and that the Trump administration and Congress deliver $1 trillion in fiscal support, according to the bank’s U.S. chief economist, Michael Feroli. Other analysts are also forecasting downturns in the United States and across the globe, as authorities restrict movement and public outings to essentials only in a bid to safeguard public health. In the United States, the ripple effects of rapidly shuttering restaurants, shops and businesses are putting millions of jobs at risk. “The United States, Europe, and Japan are headed for recession,” IHS Markit said on Wednesday, forecasting world real GDP to grow just 0.7% this year, and the U.S. economy to shrink by 0.2%. The JP Morgan view has the U.S. economy shrinking 1.5% for the full year, and unemployment, now at a 50-year low of 3.5%, rising to 6.25% by the middle of the year before easing to about 5.25% by year end as economic growth restarts."

The unprecedented pandemic has affected hundreds of millions of people worldwide, as more than 200,000 people are confirmed to have the flu-like virus, 8,500 have died, and tens of millions more are either not working because their workplaces have closed or are working from home.

The bank will also give $3 million to international groups that provide similar assistance. In addition, the bank is giving $2 million to the United Nations and World Health Organization’s COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund, and $1 million each to Feeding America’s response fund, GlobalGiving Foundation’s European response fund, and the China Foundation for Poverty Alleviation.

3.983944786274591," JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon recovering after emergency heart surgery NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N CEO and Chairman Jamie Dimon is recovering from emergency heart surgery done on Thursday morning, with two deputies taking over as he recuperates, the largest U.S. bank said. Dimon, 63, experienced a tear in his heart’s main artery, which was detected early and treated successfully, JPMorgan said, publicly releasing an internal memo. He is “awake, alert and recovering well,” according to the memo. The bank did not disclose where Dimon is being treated. The bank’s co-presidents and co-chief operating officers, Daniel Pinto and Gordon Smith, sent the message to all employees, and are running JPMorgan as Dimon recovers. Dimon has been CEO of JPMorgan for over a decade, and is a larger-than-life figure on Wall Street. He has fashioned himself into a voice of the industry and become more active in Washington in recent years. He often uses his platform as head of the country’s biggest bank to opine on issues that fall outside that scope, including immigration, education and healthcare. At various times, Dimon has also mocked financial regulators, cursed during public appearances and joked about becoming U.S. president. During his time at the helm of JPMorgan, Dimon has turned the bank into a global behemoth, with leading positions in many key businesses, through crisis-era acquisitions as well as opportunistic market-share grabs. His most vulnerable time as CEO may have come after a trader known as “the London Whale” caused billions of dollars’ worth of losses from derivatives positions in 2012 that management overlooked. Industry analysts characterized Pinto and Smith as capable hands at the helm of JPMorgan, but noted that Dimon’s health scare raised new questions about who will succeed him for the long term. He also battled throat cancer after a diagnosis in 2014 that sidelined him for several months. “This will definitely get the board to step up their efforts to put in place a succession plan because it is not going to be easy to replace someone like Dimon,” said a Hong Kong-based consultant who works with the bank. “They will have to cast their net very, very wide and will have to look both internally and externally.” The condition for which Dimon had surgery on Thursday is called an acute aortic dissection, where the inner lining of the aorta tears away from the outer edge of the tube. It is a serious, potentially deadly event that, left untreated, can lead to a heart attack or the aorta collapsing, said Dr. Gabriele Di Luozzo, director of thoracic aortic surgery at Mount Sinai Morningside hospital in New York. During surgery, about 6-8 inches of the aorta nearest to the heart is replaced typically with a synthetic tube, said Di Luozzo. “This is a major operation,” Di Luozzo said. “In a typical elective surgery (to replace) an aorta, the risk of death is in the 2-3% range. But when you have an emergency operation it can be as high as 20%.” If treated in time, patients typically spend a week in hospital followed by several weeks recovery at home, he said. Dimon’s surgery was successful and bank executives said they expect him to return to work. When Dimon was going through cancer treatment, he curtailed travel and made fewer public appearances, but eventually recovered and got back to work. Questions about who might succeed him have existed for years, as many executives who were viewed as potential successors left out of impatience or for other opportunities. Pinto and Smith are relatively close in age to Dimon, who said in promoting them in 2018 that he wanted to stay in the job for five more years. Two other people often talked about as potential CEOs are Marianne Lake, who runs JPMorgan’s consumer business, as well as Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Piepszak. “The bottom line is that Mr. Dimon is often viewed as a steady hand for the banking industry during turbulent times (like we are in now),” KBW analyst Brian Kleinhanzl said in a note to clients, referring to recent market chaos and economic concerns stemming from the coronavirus outbreak. “Not having him at the helm of JPMorgan is a modest negative.”"

This week the bank may also begin sending teams of traders to work from secondary office locations in Brooklyn, New York, and nearby in New Jersey, to test its systems and ensure that any kinks are worked out should the bank need to roll out emergency plans more broadly, one of the sources said. The largest U.S. bank by assets is testing these contingency plans now because, if the coronavirus spreads further in the United States, it would need to separate employees of the bank’s many business lines to ensure that most business could continue as usual, one source said. The bank began asking managers of each of its four main businesses to select employees and ask them to work from home starting last week. Managers in the consumer & community banking division, which includes Chase bank and employs more than 120,000 people, have asked around 10% of employees to work from home a day this week. The corporate and investment bank employees were asked last week. The project was code-named “Project Kennedy”, Bloomberg first reported on Tuesday. Big U.S. banks have been rolling out contingency plans to respond to the global virus outbreak — requiring some staff to work from home, implementing travel restrictions and talking to regulators about potential stresses. European banks are doing the same and also splitting shifts and isolating some teams. Last week on Thursday, JPMorgan told employees it was restricting all but essential international work travel due to the continued spread of the virus."

-13.101634821683158," CORRECTED-JPMorgan inclusion adds shine to rising Chinese bonds (Corrects to say monthly inflow estimates came from analysts, not JPMorgan) HONG KONG, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Chinese government bonds are rallying their way into JP Morgan’s widely-tracked indices on Friday, as expectations of falling interest rates coincide with the pre-scheduled inclusion. Nine bonds with maturities between five to 10 years are entering the Government Bond Index Emerging Markets (GBI-EM) suite over 10 months, eventually giving China a 10% weighting in the flagship Global Diversified, which is tracked by $202 billion of funds. This will draw $3 billion to China each month, according to analyst estimates. The inclusion “underscores growing interest in the world’s second-largest bond market,” Ming Leap, associate director for fixed income at HSBC Global Asset Management, said in a memo. The market is particularly attractive to international investors “at a time when nearly a quarter of the global bond market is offering negative yields,” he said. The inclusion could lend momentum to foreign purchases of Chinese government bonds, which has slowed since the end of December, Janice Xue, rates strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, wrote in a research report on Thursday. Chinese bonds were already rallying before Friday as fears of the spreading coronavirus outbreak sent investors rushing to safe-haven assets. Bond markets were cheered by China’s rapid-fire measures to shore up investor confidence and keep businesses afloat as the epidemic hurt economic activity, which included steps to lower the costs of bank loans and bonds. Yields on 10-year Chinese government bonds hit a fresh three-year low of 2.81% on Thursday, slumping 24 basis points over the past month. “I am optimistic that yields can go lower still,” said Edmund Goh, Asian fixed income investment director at Aberdeen Standard Investments in Shanghai, who increased Chinese government bond positions in his portfolio around the Lunar New Year in late January when coronavirus cases started to spike in China. Karan Talwar, an emerging markets investment specialist at BNP Paribas Asset Management in Hong Kong, said investors required few incentives from the index publisher to tap Chinese bonds. “The JPMorgan inclusion on its own is not going to move the $13 trillion market,” he said. “$2.5 billion or $3 billion a month will not be a key factor in driving inflows.” The Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index, tracked by a larger pool of $2.5 trillion, was the first of the three major bond indexes to incorporate China last year. FTSE Russell’s World Government Bond Index left China out amid long-standing operational concerns last September, but the country remains on the watchlist for entry next month."

-15.610627972576122," UPDATE 1-Wall St banks cut Brazil 2020 GDP growth forecast further below 2% threshold (Adds JP Morgan forecast change, byline) BRASILIA, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Bank of America Merrill Lynch on Thursday cut its 2020 Brazilian economic growth outlook to under 2.0%, while JP Morgan reduced its outlook for Latin America’s largest economy even further below the threshold that many observers say is highly sensitive for President Jair Bolsonaro’s administration. Economy Minister Paulo Guedes and other officials have consistently said the government’s right-wing economic reforms and record low interest rates will deliver growth this year comfortably above 2%, with Guedes confident of 2.5%. But several economic indicators have been weaker than expected recently, and Brazilian media have reported that Bolsonaro is becoming increasingly frustrated with Guedes the more it looks like 2% growth this year might be in jeopardy. Citing the hit to China’s economy from the coronavirus outbreak, economists at BAML and JP Morgan both cut their 2020 Brazil growth outlook for the second time this month, with BAML’s going to 1.9% from 2.2%, and JP Morgan to 1.8% from 1.9%. “The coronavirus outbreak should negatively impact exports. Given the expected bigger impact from the virus and ongoing mixed economic activity indicators in Brazil, we shave our forecast by another 30bp (basis points),” BAML economists David Beker and Ana Madeira wrote in a research note. JP Morgan’s economists said investment growth this year will now be lower at 5.0%, while exports will fall 0.5% compared with an earlier forecast of 0.5% expansion. “All in all, we now see 2020 GDP rising 1.8%, a tenth lower than our estimate published at the beginning of this month,” they wrote. The government’s official 2020 growth forecast remains 2.4%, although Treasury Secretary Mansueto Almeida said in an interview earlier this month that may be revised. A few private sector forecasters, like UK-based research firm Capital Economics, are more gloomy, predicting 1.5% growth this year. The average from the central bank’s latest ‘FOCUS’ survey of economists this week edged down to 2.2% from 2.23%. (Reporting by Jamie McGeever; Editing by Steve Orlofsky and Richard Chang)"

JPMorgan said on Monday that it would detail the initiatives at the bank's investor day. The bank has faced years of criticism from environmentalists for its relationships with fossil-fuel companies, scrutiny it has sought to avoid at events like its annual shareholder meeting, which are open to the public. (reut.rs/38lCdmj) The bank’s changing approach at its 15th annual investor day, which is invitation-only, comes as other big U.S. banks have announced similar initiatives. JPMorgan said it will facilitate $200 billion of transactions in 2020 that “support climate action” and advance the United Nations’ sustainable development goals. Those transactions are expected to be a mix of loans, underwriting, advisory services and investments, and will include $50 billion of financing for green initiatives, which was earmarked to count toward a 2017 target. The bank said it will also stop providing financing for new oil and gas developments in the Arctic, and will expand restrictions on its financing of coal mining and coal-fired power. Environmental activist group Rainforest Action Network said it welcomed the bank’s new restrictions on providing financing to coal companies, but said the bank could further restrict lending. “Their coal mining financing represented less than 1% of their overall fossil financing” in recent years, said Jason Disterhoft, a climate and energy senior campaigner with Rainforest Action Network. “We need to see much more from them, particularly in terms of phasing out their fossil financing.” The bank declined to comment on the amount of previous revenues gained from this type of lending. Separately, JPMorgan has asked regulators for permission to skip a vote on a shareholder resolution seeking a review of its voting on climate-related proposals put to companies in which it holds stakes. Among other things the bank has argued its board does not directly control proxy voting by its asset management division. Tim Smith of resolution filer Boston Trust Walden, an investment management firm, said he hopes for an agreement as regulators review the matter. “Let’s see if the two sides can come to an agreement, because the clock is ticking,” he said. Smith said his firm and another filer agreed to withdraw a similar resolution at BlackRock Inc, BLK.N which agreed to further talks with activists. BlackRock did not immediately comment.

-23.320367040505804," JPMorgan gets busy in repo lending after regulatory thumbs up -CFO NEW YORK, Feb 25 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co is putting more cash into overnight lending markets and holding less for a rainy day, after discussing the matter with regulators, the bank’s finance chief said on Tuesday. The change in approach comes months after a squeeze in short-term lending markets led the U.S. Federal Reserve to step in and provide funding. JPMorgan executives had complained that capital requirements prevented the bank from financing such loans itself, but regulators have since eased up, Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Piepszak said. As a result, JPMorgan has decided it can hold less cash for its resolution plan, and instead factor in the possibility that it would use the Fed’s emergency lending facility, known as the discount window. “We think that this is an important step for us to take to help break the stigma here, and it’s also consistent with the public comments from the Fed,” she told attendees of JPMorgan’s investor day in New York. Fed officials including Vice Chair Randal Quarles have indicated support for changes that would make it easier for banks to be more involved in overnight lending, also known as repo markets. JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, is a major player in repo. Its decision to become a more active lender there should help liquidity more broadly, Piepszak said.

-23.320367040505804," JPMorgan raises clean energy spending goals, profit targets unchanged  (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N largely maintained its key profit goals for the medium term on Tuesday, signaling steady but slower growth, and raised its financial commitment for clean-energy initiatives after years of pressure from environmental activists. The largest U.S. bank will target $200 billion in lending and other financial services for green and sustainable companies and projects, up from an earlier target of $175 billion set in 2017, according to a presentation ahead of its annual investor day. The new target, however, failed to satisfy some climate-change activists who flocked outside JPMorgan’s New York headquarters, partially blocking some entrances and demanding that the bank get rid of fossil-fuel clients. At the investor meet, Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Piepszak said she was confident that the bank’s near to medium-term growth would be backed by a robust U.S. economy, despite some near-term headwinds. “We can outperform on a relative basis regardless of the environment,” Piepszak said. “Although risks are more skewed to the down side given ... risks like coronavirus, we are confident that the strength of our operating model will continue to demonstrate strength.” The bank projected that return on tangible common equity (ROTCE), a key measure used to determine how well a bank is using its shareholders’ money, will be the same as last year’s target of 17%. However, JPMorgan cut its outlook for net interest income (NII) to $57 billion for 2020 from $57.8 billion in 2019, blaming lower interest rates. The bank forecast NII of $60 billion or more for 2021, which was above analysts’ estimates. The bank also forecast higher expenses of $67 billion, compared with $65.3 billion last year, despite a “reduction in structural expenses.” The presentation showed that JPMorgan’s outlook remained unchanged for profit at its corporate & investment bank (CIB), a disappointment for analysts who had expected the lender to push for higher growth at the unit that accounted for a third of total revenue in 2019. It expects return on equity of 16%, unchanged from the target that was set a year ago. Targeted return on equity stayed unchanged at 25%-plus for the consumer & community banking segment, and remained flat at 18% for the commercial banking segment. JPMorgan also maintained the outlook for the asset and wealth management business and said it expected a 25%-plus return on equity in the medium term."
-23.320367040505804," JPMorgan to maintain key growth targets from last year at investor day -analysts NEW YORK, Feb 25 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co executives are unlikely to provide new financial targets at the bank’s annual investor day on Tuesday, and instead will use the forum to showcase a clean-energy initiative, analysts said. JPMorgan, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, reported record earnings last year and easily met management’s stated goals for expenses and profitability. But its metrics are best-in-class among big U.S. banks, and JPMorgan’s sheer size presents challenges for further growth, analysts said. “We believe the challenge is for JPM to maintain this strong operating performance while at the same time investing for growth and gaining customer wallet share,” said Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo. Nonetheless, Wall Street pays close attention to JPMorgan’s investor day, where Chief Executive Jamie Dimon and other senior leaders offer views about key businesses, as well as the global economy and financial markets. Those presenting include Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Piepszak, head of Consumer & Community Banking Gordon Smith, Head of Consumer Lending Marianne Lake and others. The event starts at 8 a.m. in New York. Executives are likely to express optimism about JPMorgan’s potential, despite unsettling macroeconomic events such as concerns over the fast-spreading coronavirus, the 2020 U.S. presidential election and low interest rates, analysts said. On Monday, global markets plunged as investors ran for safety on fears that a rise in coronavirus cases outside China could expand damage to the global economy. In the United States, the Dow dropped more than 1,000 points for just the third time in history. However, JPMorgan will likely keep the bank’s official outlook stable for expenses relative to revenue, and for return on tangible common equity (ROTCE), which measures how well a bank uses shareholder money to produce profit. Last year, JPMorgan’s efficiency ratio of 55% and its full-year ROTCE of 19% met and exceeded management’s targets of 55% and 17%, respectively. The bank’s main announcement will center on steps it is taking to reduce financing for coal mining projects and companies and to facilitate $200 billion in loans and other financing for clean-energy and sustainability initiatives by the end of 2020. The bank detailed some of that plan on Monday, after years of pressure from environmental activists and steps taken by other major financial firms including Blackrock Inc and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. JPMorgan shares closed at $132.14 on Monday, near a record high, leaving the bank as the most valuable by market value globally.

SIA, which is being advised by Rothschild ROTH.PA, has sent out requests for proposals to banks for potential roles in organizing the deal and is looking to fill them in the coming weeks, the sources said. It plans to issue shares worth 1 billion-1.5 billion euros ($1 bln-$1.6 bln) in a deal that could value the business at more than 4 billion euros excluding debt, another source said. JPMorgan JPM.N and UniCredit CRDI.MI are expected to be frontrunners for the global coordinators spots, two of the sources said. SIA, JPMorgan, Rothschild and UniCredit declined to comment. SIA’s listing comes after European initial public offerings (IPO) dropped to a seven-year low last year. Yet European stock markets are near record highs boosting investors confidence and offering a window of opportunity for IPO candidates after a flurry of secondary share sales were well received this year. Milan-based SIA is controlled by Italian state lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CDP) through investment vehicle FSIA Investimenti, which owns a 57.42% stake. CDP also owns 25.69% of SIA via its holding CDP Equity which gives the state lender an overall exposure of slightly more than 83%. Italian lender Banco BPM and asset manager Banca Mediolanum control 5.33% and 2.85% of SIA, respectively, while Deutsche Bank has 2.58% of the company. The company said earlier this month that it had started preparations for a Milan float which could take place before the summer. SIA provides payment services for the banking sector and has the London Stock Exchange among its clients. Its services include a capital markets software which aims at improving transparency during the IPO or rights issue process - though it is not clear if it will be used for the potential listing. SIA, which has core earnings of 201 million euros, has also explored a tie up with another payments firm as an alternative option, said a source.

-32.623181743472735," Exclusive: JPMorgan shakes up investment bank in leadership makeover - sources LONDON (Reuters) - JPMorgan JPM.N is reshuffling senior management at the top of its investment bank, naming two new global co-heads and shifting some of its most senior dealmakers into new jobs focused purely on bringing in business, two sources told Reuters. The Wall Street bank has named Viswas Raghavan and James Casey to jointly run its global investment banking unit, one source said. The appointments are part of a sweeping reshuffle in which some senior executives will take on “rainmaker” roles. Global M&A co-heads Hernan Cristerna and Chris Ventresca are among those who will drop management responsibilities and instead join a new executive committee of 18 global chairs, the two sources said, focused on winning business from clients. To fill their shoes the bank is promoting eight bankers to manage specific regions and products, the first source said. These include Dorothee Blessing and Conor Hillery who will become co-heads of investment banking in Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Fernando Rivas who is taking the helm of the same unit in North America. Raghavan and Casey - currently chief executive officer and head of banking for EMEA and global head of debt capital markets respectively - will both report into JPMorgan’s global banking head Carlos Hernandez who is in turn taking on a new role as executive chairman of global investment banking, one source said. This source said Raghavan would keep his EMEA chief executive job, reporting to the bank’s co-president Daniel Pinto in this capacity. JPMorgan’s leadership makeover highlights the pressures big investment banks are under to retain senior staff in the face of increasing competition from rival boutiques which can attract seasoned bankers with more entrepreneurial roles. Wall Street firms face a tricky balancing act to keep their long-serving top managers happy while providing promotion opportunities for the next generation of leaders. “This is the bulge-bracket response to the boutiques’ threat,” the second source said. “It is a good way to motivate senior bankers who tend to move to boutiques when they feel there is nothing more to achieve in their current roles,” he said. In investment banking, titles such as managing director or senior vice chairman are the ultimate status symbols, a sign that someone has made it. But with many bankers reaching the “managing director” grade in their early thirties, banks are looking for new ways to motivate them and reward their loyalty. Hernandez, who is driving the changes, wants the bank’s global chairman network to focus solely on client relationships and also to mentor a new breed of dealmakers, the two sources said. “This is not a trophy title,” the first source said. “People will need to bring in real business.” Current wealth management executive chair Andy Cohen is set to be part of the new global chairmen group while continuing in his previous role. Three women have made it to the same executive committee, namely global head of equity capital markets Liz Myers and global chairs Isabelle Sellier and Jennifer Nason whose focus has so far been on financial services and TMT respectively, the source said. The group will also include healthcare rainmaker Steven Frank and several existing vice chairs such as London-based Harry Hampson and New York-based Ben Berinstein, the source said. Under the new structure, Anu Aiyengar and Dirk Albersmeier will take over from Cristerna and Ventresca as global co-heads of M&A, the source said. Power sharing will also apply to equity capital markets with Achintya Mangla and Mike Millman becoming global co-heads of ECM while Kevin Foley will run global debt capital markets (DCM) alone, the source said. Asia Pacific will not be impacted by the changes with Filippo Gori continuing as head of banking for the region and similarly Martin Marron will stay in charge of investment banking in Latin America and Canada. All the regional and product heads – who will report into Raghavan and Casey – will need to ensure JPMorgan maintains its 2019 ranking, based on Refinitiv data, as the top global investment bank by fees, having earned $6.5 billion in fees, or 6.5% of the overall global fee pool ahead of Goldman Sachs GS.N. They will pair up with some of the newly-appointed global chairmen to foster team-work and a more cooperative culture. “This is far from being a retirement plan for anyone,” said one of the sources. “The ultimate goal is to breed the next generation of star bankers.”"

-38.42240511857998," JPMorgan sets July deadline for fintechs to sign new data access deals: sources WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N has told financial technology companies they will be barred from accessing its customer information by July 30 unless they sign data access agreements with the bank and back a plan to stop using customer passwords to gather the data. The largest U.S. bank by assets set the new deadline in a letter sent to the companies in late January, in which it said they must agree to a “concrete plan” to transition to a new method of collecting customer data, according to two people familiar with the matter. Otherwise, JPMorgan will block all automated access to the data, including through so-called screenscraping, or the process of collecting data from one application to use it in another, the people said. A JPMorgan spokesman confirmed the contents of the letter and said the company already had agreements covering more than 95% of data access requests. The deadline is the latest move in the bank’s effort to transition fintechs and data aggregators to what it has said is a more secure way of accessing customer data. Fintech startups, such as those that offer budgeting apps or digital wealth management, usually connect to a user's bank account to gather the necessary data to provide their services. Some gather the data through aggregators such as Yodlee and Plaid, which is in the process of being acquired by Visa Inc V.N, while others request that customers provide their password. Through JPMorgan’s new method, fintechs will not be able to use customers’ passwords to access their entire financial data, but will instead connect to a set of bank programming code known as an API, that grants access only to limited account information authorized by the consumer. The transition comes as large banks and fintech companies globally tussle over data-sharing. Banks have said their wariness to grant access to third parties stems from a need to protect highly sensitive information, such as transaction history and income. Fintechs have been skeptical, arguing that it should be up to consumers, not banks, to decide what companies can look at that information. JPMorgan said earlier this year that it was preparing to crack down on the use of customer passwords for data-sharing purposes, and had been discussing another method to access information since 2016. However, some startups said they were surprised by the stringent requirements and strict deadline in the letter, according to one fintech source. “We’ve been working on this with aggregators and fintechs since 2016 because our secure API is the best way to help our customers make smart money decisions more easily and safely,” Paul LaRusso, managing director of digital platforms at Chase, said in a written statement to Reuters. The bank said companies that have agreed to JPM’s terms would be able to continue accessing customer data using existing tools, provided they have a concrete plan in place to move to the new method and are making progress toward that goal. “Customers can still use their favorite apps and websites while these companies migrate to our API,” LaRusso said.

The largest U.S. bank by assets set the new deadline in a letter sent to the companies in late January, in which it also said they must agree a “concrete plan” to transition to a new method of collecting customer data, according to two people familiar with the matter. Otherwise, JPMorgan will block all automated access to the data, including through so-called screenscraping, or the process of collecting data from one application to use it in another, the people said. A JPMorgan spokesman confirmed the contents of the letter and said the company already has agreements with more than 95 percent of companies that request data access. The deadline is the latest move in the bank’s effort to transition fintechs and data aggregators to what it has said is a more secure way of accessing customer data. Fintech startups, such as those that offer budgeting apps or digital wealth management, usually connect to a user’s bank account to gather the necessary data to provide their services. Some gather the data through aggregators such as Visa Inc -owned Plaid or Yodlee, while others request that customers provide their password. Through JPMorgan’s new method, fintechs will not be able to use customers’ passwords to access their entire financial data, but will instead connect to a set of bank programming code known as an API, that grants access only to limited account information authorized by the consumer. The transition comes as large banks and fintech companies globally tussle over data-sharing. Banks have said their wariness to grant access to third parties stems from a need to protect highly sensitive information, such as transaction history and income. Fintechs have been skeptical, arguing that it should be up to consumers, not banks, to decide what companies can look at that information. JPMorgan said earlier this year that it was preparing to crack down on the use of customer passwords for data-sharing purposes, and had been discussing another method to access information since 2016. However, some startups said they were surprised by the stringent requirements and strict deadline in the letter, according to one fintech source. “We’ve been working on this with aggregators and fintechs since 2016 because our secure API is the best way to help our customers make smart money decisions more easily and safely,” Paul LaRusso, managing director of digital platforms at Chase, said in a written statement to Reuters. The bank said companies that have agreed to JPM’s terms would be able to continue accessing customer data using existing tools, provided they have a concrete plan in place to move to the new method and are making progress toward that goal. “Customers can still use their favorite apps and websites while these companies migrate to our API,” LaRusso said.

Activists, including the As You Sow Foundation, Trillium Asset Management and Boston Trust Walden, said they had received notices that the bank has asked for regulatory permission to skip votes at its spring annual meeting on proposals such as reporting on greenhouse gas emissions tied to its lending. JPMorgan’s position creates reputational risks at a time when clients and investors want banks to help slow the rate of a global rise in temperature, according to a joint statement from the activists on Wednesday. “They’re not walking their talk,” said Danielle Fugere, president of As You Sow, in an interview. She noted how, in correspondence with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission posted on the agency’s website, JPMorgan argued that her group’s request for an emissions report amounted to an attempt to “micromanage” the company. “I was surprised at the depth and breadth of the argument saying there’s no way you can talk to us about anything,” Fugere said. Asked about the matter, a JPMorgan representative referred to arguments it laid out in filings to the SEC. In addition to the micromanagement concern, JPMorgan, among other things, said the issues related to “ordinary business” and that its board does not approve its proxy voting policy. Top U.S. corporations routinely seek permission to skip controversial shareholder proposals. Activists have also filed climate proposals at other banks and energy companies, and have sought votes against JPMorgan lead independent director Lee Raymond, a former Exxon Mobil Corp CEO. XOM.N The activists hope to get a boost from a recent announcement by top asset manager BlackRock Inc BLK.N to put more focus on environmental issues. Indeed, other banks have been more receptive to such proposals, or at least, not tried to block them, said Christina Cobourn Herman, program director at the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, which represents the activists. The group says JPMorgan is the largest financier of the fossil fuel industry among 33 top global banks. Dimon has expressed support for the Paris Agreement to combat global climate warming, and in August joined the CEOs of more than 180 U.S. companies who signed a “statement of corporate purpose,” arguing that corporate America should focus on social responsibility, including protecting the environment."

-34.12686969465986," Exclusive: JPMorgan in talks to merge blockchain unit Quorum with startup ConsenSys - sources NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co is in talks to merge its marquee blockchain unit Quorum with Brooklyn-based startup ConsenSys, according to people familiar with the plans. The deal is likely to be formally announced within the next six months, but financial terms are still unclear, the people said. Around 25 people currently work on the Quorum team globally, and it is unclear whether they will join ConsenSys after the merger, the people said. Blockchain emerged over a decade ago as the software tracking cryptocurrency transactions. Since then, banks and other large corporations have been investing millions of dollars to develop and test a range of business applications using the nascent technology. Efforts have had mixed results, with few projects achieving significant impact. JPMorgan built the Quorum blockchain internally using the ethereum network, the software that underpins ether, one of the most well known cryptocurrencies. It is being used by JPMorgan to run the Interbank Information Network, a payments network that involves more than 300 banks. JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets, also said it would use Quorum to issue a digital currency called JPMorgan Coin that it designed to make instantaneous payments using blockchain. A merger with ConsenSys would have no impact on the IIN and other JPMorgan projects running on Quorum, one of the people said. JPMorgan has been considering spinning off Quorum for around two years, evaluating options including setting up an open-source foundation, creating a new startup or merging it with another company, the person said. A merger with ConsenSys was chosen as the best path forward as both organizations work with ethereum and have been involved in joint initiatives in the past. ConsenSys, a prominent blockchain startup that grew rapidly during the 2017 crypto bubble, was founded by Joe Lubin, one of the co-founders of ethereum. The company announced last week that it had laid off around 14% of its staff, as it undergoes a restructuring to separate its software development business from its venture activities. A merger with Quorum would align with its shift toward growing its software division. Quorum is open source, meaning its code is free and may be modified and redistributed. The plan after the merger is to maintain the Quorum brand and keep the technology open source, one of the people said."
-34.002520819596974," Australia cartel investigator says no impropriety in exchanges with JPMorgan lawyers SYDNEY (Reuters) - An Australian antitrust investigator who helped bring criminal cartel charges against Citigroup Inc C.N and Deutsche Bank AG DBKGn.DE denied acting with ""impropriety"" when presented with communications between the regulator and informants' lawyers. The court testimony from Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) enforcement director Michael Taylor on Monday points to a defense strategy questioning the integrity of an investigation that ended in charges of collusion during a A$2.5 billion ($1.67 billion) share sale in 2015. In pre-trial hearings, lawyers for the investment banks and their client, retail lender Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd (ANZ) ANZ.AX, have been trying to show witness statements by a third investment bank which worked on the deal, JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, were tainted by coordination between JPMorgan's lawyers and the authorities. JPMorgan and its staff and ex-staff agreed to act as informants with the ACCC in exchange for immunity from prosecution, the court has previously heard. On Monday, Taylor, the first ACCC employee to testify, was handed a note, and Deutsche lawyer Murugan Thangaraj told the packed courtroom it showed a JPMorgan lawyer notifying the ACCC about a discrepancy between statements from JPMorgan witnesses. “That’s what the file note records,” Taylor said. “That’s an example of the JPMorgan lawyers attempting to give advice to the ACCC about how to build a case,” said Thangaraj. “That’s your proposition,” replied Taylor. “If there are inconsistencies, I want to bring them out. I want to know.” The JPMorgan witnesses had seemed to be “full, frank and truthful” throughout their ACCC interviews, Taylor added. Taylor said he had taken charge of investigations for 30 years and that in this instance, the interviews demanded “more governance than I have ever been involved in”. More than a year and a half since the charges were brought against Citi, Deutsche, ANZ and several of their executives, the matter is yet to go to trial. None of the accused has entered a formal plea, but all have said they will plead not guilty. The case hinges on allegations the banks colluded to keep hold of ANZ stock to prop up its price. It is being closely watched by investment bankers around the world because it could have implications about the way they are allowed to run share sales. During a sometimes tense local court hearing, Taylor was presented with another email which Thangaraj said showed him arranging to meet JPMorgan lawyers without obtaining the necessary clearance. When Taylor said he was unclear of the email’s significance, Thangaraj said, “You are perfectly clear what this is about.” “I am absolutely not,” said Taylor. “I don’t know if the meeting occurred. I’ve read the email. I honestly don’t know. I would not ever act with impropriety. I would never ever act inappropriately.” When Taylor said again that he was confused by the significance of the email, Thangaraj told the court, “that’s rubbish.” The hearing continues."

That was a 1.6% increase from the $31 million he received for 2018. The bank said it was based on its strong performance last year and “over the long term,” according to the filing. The bank said its board of directors considered the bank’s business results, risk controls and conduct, client, customer and stakeholder focus and teamwork and leadership when determining Dimon’s pay. Under Dimon, JPMorgan reported net income of $36.4 billion for 2019, up from $32.5 billion a year earlier, and a return on tangible common equity of 19%, up from 17% in 2018. Dimon's raise stands in contrast to the pay cut that Morgan Stanley's MS.N board delivered to its chief executive, James Gorman, reducing his pay by 7% for 2019 as the bank trimmed incentive compensation firm-wide in an effort to reduce expenses. Even so, Gorman is richly compensated, receiving $27 million for 2019.

JPMorgan would have said “No” to a Paris move back in 2016, its French executive told Reuters, but government-led labor law and taxation reforms made it review its stance. The U.S. bank said it plans to buy a building in central Paris from France’s BNP Paribas to house up to 450 staff in coming years, allowing it to keep operating in the EU once the current unfettered two-way direct access between Britain and the bloc comes to an end in December following a Brexit transition period. The expansion is expected to make the French capital, where it currently has 260 staff, its second-largest base in Europe behind London, where there are 10,000 staff, JPMorgan said. It currently has 600 staff in Luxembourg and 450 in Frankfurt. The bank will initially transfer sales teams, followed by trading staff depending on the timing of Britain’s full withdrawal from the European Union, Kyril Courboin, JPMorgan’s CEO of France, told Reuters. “Paris is going to be the second pole for our market activities in Europe,” he said. “London will still be number one because we are only transferring euro activities.” He declined to disclose the purchase price of the new building, which is close to JPMorgan’s existing Paris offices on the prestigious Place Vendome. The move is part of a wider trend of banks shifting selected activities to euro-zone cities ahead of Brexit, without calling into question London’s dominance as Europe’s premier financial center. Large international banks and investors could relocate around 4,000 jobs to Paris, the French financial lobby Paris Europlace said, citing data from “Choose Paris Region”, which helps international companies set up business in Paris. “In addition to the new announcements made by American banks...Asian investors, from HongKong and Singapore...confirm their wish to strengthen their activities in Europe, in particular in Paris,” Arnaud de Bresson, chief executive of Paris Europlace, told Reuters. Wells Fargo, which currently has three job openings in Paris, said in October it had chosen the city as its European hub for post-Brexit trading activities. Bank of America BAC.N also plans to move more than 400 jobs into a new office in central Paris. An Elysee official said JPMorgan was one of several large banks who have been considering a move to Paris, without naming others, leaving open the possibility that more jobs will be relocated to the “city of lights”. The building purchase by JPMorgan was announced on Sunday as part of the “Choose France” drive, an annual investment event created by President Emmanuel Macron to draw business leaders to France en route to the World Economic Forum in Davos each January."

Executives were positive and clear-eyed about the outlook for 2020, as well. “Our outlook heading into 2020 is constructive, underpinned by the strength of the U.S. consumer,” said JPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Piepszak on a call with analysts. “In spite expected slower global growth and the backdrop of geopolitical uncertainties, we remain well-positioned.” Big bank rivals Citigroup C.N and Wells Fargo WFC.N also reported earnings on Tuesday. Citi beat profit estimates thanks to a jump in trading revenue and strong credit card sales, while Wells Fargo's profits slumped on a rise in legal reserves. [nL4N29J366] At JPMorgan, the only business to post a decline was commercial banking, which reported revenues fell 3% on lower net interest income and higher expenses due to investments in the business.The bank’s bond trading revenue jumped 86% compared to a year earlier when financial markets were walloped industry-wide by a sell-off driven by trade and global growth concerns. Revenue from equity markets rose 15% to $1.5 billion. Piepszak conceded that its returns in bond-trading benefited from “a favorable comparison against a challenging fourth quarter last year,” but said there were examples of strength across the business. Debt underwriting fees in the investment bank rose 11 percent year over year, in part thanks to the increased activity in bond issuance which made for competitive pricing conditions, she said. Overall revenue at JPMorgan’s corporate and investment banking unit, which houses its trading and underwriting businesses, surged 31% to $9.47 billion. The consumer and community banking business, which accounts for almost half of the bank’s revenues, reported a $14 billion, or 3% rise, over last year. Chase credit card customers used their plastic to the bank’s benefit this holiday season. The bank reported credit card, merchant services and auto revenue surged $6.3 billion or 9%, with credit card loans up 8%. But revenues were under pressure this quarter from lower deposit margins because low interest rates meant that the bank earned less on deposits it loaned out. Home lending revenue was also down 5% to $1.3 billion. Total loans, excluding home lending, rose 3% in the quarter. Home loans were down 17%. Deposits flowed into the consumer bank in the fourth quarter, helping to offset a decline in loans, as Chase opened around 100 new bank branches 2019 in many new cities where it previously had not been located. Deposits grew 5% compared to a year ago. CEO Jamie Dimon said the U.S. consumer continued to be in a strong position. “Their wages are up, their assets are up, their investments are up, their home values are up,” he said on a call with reporters. The bank's net income rose to $8.52 billion, or $2.57 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, from $7.07 billion, or $1.98 per share, a year earlier. Net revenue rose 9% to $29.21 billion.

-30.42214560234018," JPMorgan Chase raises fee on popular Sapphire Reserve credit card NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N said on Wednesday it was raising the annual fee for its popular Chase Sapphire Reserve credit card by $100, according to a press release from the bank. Starting on Jan. 12, all new applicants for the card will be charged a $550 annual fee, up from $450. After April 1, all existing cardholders will be charged the higher annual fee when it comes time for their annual renewal. The largest U.S. bank said in the statement that the price increase comes as it expands its program of travel rewards and ways to earn points. The bank has also struggled to manage the expense of the Sapphire Reserve card, which annually gives customers hundreds of dollars in travel credit and rewards points for a range of transportation expenses, like airline flights, roadway tolls and subway fares. More than 40 million U.S. households have a credit card from JPMorgan, which comprises about 19 percent of the market, executives have said. The bank is gambling that customers will deem the Chase Sapphire Reserve cards, which launched in 2016, valuable enough for its rich rewards and travel perks that they do not mind the $100 price increase. This week, the bank announced new partnerships with the ride-hailing app Lyft Inc LYFT.O and the food delivery services DoorDash Inc. Starting Jan. 13, Sapphire Reserve cardholders will get 10 points per dollar spent on Lyft rides and a free year subscription to Lyft's membership program, Lyft Pink, which gives users discounted rides and other perks.

-37.49719631280526," JPMorgan metals traders under Singapore scrutiny, two more depart: sources NEW YORK/LONDON/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Regulatory scrutiny of precious metals trading at JPMorgan Chase & Co., one of the world’s largest gold brokerages, has expanded to Singapore and ensnared two more bank employees, according to people familiar with the situation. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is looking into the bank’s precious metals trading unit, three sources confirmed. A probe in the United States has resulted in criminal charges against six current and former employees of the bank. Regulators in the United Kingdom are also interested in the matter, Reuters has reported. JPMorgan’s global precious metals trading staff has shrunk to around half a dozen people, industry sources say. Tonny Ka, the bank’s head precious metals trader in Singapore, has been put on leave, two of the people said. The regulatory attention has also forced out Donald Turnbull, who until recently led JPMorgan’s global precious metals trading operation out of New York, one person told Reuters. Efforts to reach Turnbull were unsuccessful. Ka, a longtime JPMorgan employee who recently won a trading award from the Shanghai Gold Exchange, did not respond to requests for comment. The exact nature of MAS’s interest is unclear. It has not publicly accused the bank of wrongdoing. A spokeswoman said that, as a matter of policy, the Singapore authority “does not comment on our dealings with specific financial institutions.” JPMorgan has said in U.S. regulatory filings that its metals trading practices are the subject of probes from “various authorities” and that it is “responding to and cooperating with these investigations.” The ongoing probe by U.S. officials, which includes the Department of Justice (DOJ) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), has already resulted in charges against six people in 2018 and 2019 related to alleged spoofing activity between 2007 and 2016. Spoofing involves placing bids to buy or offers to sell contracts with the intent to cancel them before execution, allowing traders to influence prices. The U.S. charges have alleged the illegal trading practices took place across JPMorgan’s global precious metals trading desks in New York, London and Singapore. Four of those charged in the United States have pleaded not guilty. Two others pleaded guilty; one of them, Christiaan Trunz, spent time on JPMorgan’s Singapore metals desk, according to the DOJ. He is “cooperating with the ongoing investigation,” the department said in August. Scott Willig, listed online as a commodities trader, has replaced Turnbull as head of global precious metals trading, two people said. Willig did not respond to requests for comment."

The investment bank revised its Brent price forecast to $64.5 per barrel in 2020 from $59 earlier, although it expects prices to slip to $61.50 in 2021. West Texas Intermediate prices are seen following a similar trajectory with prices averaging $60 per barrel in 2020 and $57.50 in 2021, JP Morgan said. The end of UK electoral uncertainty and the U.S.-China trade truce along with fading of idiosyncratic headwinds in some of the larger emerging markets economies have improved the global growth outlook for next year, the bank said. “In contrast to our September forecast that the global oil market will be in surplus of 0.6 million barrels per day (mbpd) on average for 2020, we now estimate the market will be in deficit of 0.2 mbpd,” the bank said. JP Morgan continues to expect global oil demand growth at 1 mbpd. The OPEC, Russia and other producers, a group known as OPEC+, have agreed to cut output by an extra 500,000 barrels a day in the first quarter of 2020.

-35.795345608988015," JPMorgan witness in Australia cartel case says no collusion with Citi, Deutsche SYDNEY (Reuters) - A prosecution witness in an Australian criminal cartel case against Citigroup Inc C.N and Deutsche Bank AG DBKGn.DE testified he had just 30 seconds' notice about an underwriting conference call and that there was no collusion. The testimony from former JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N markets head Jeff Herbert-Smith appears to be at odds with the prosecution's case that the three banks and their client Australia and New Zealand Banking Group ANZ.AX agreed to withhold details about a A$2.5 billion ANZ share sale in 2015 to support the stock. The case, in which JPMorgan has been given immunity in exchange for cooperating with the authorities, is being closely watched by investment banks around the world because it could influence how they are allowed to conduct capital raisings. Prosecutors have argued that discussions on two conference calls in August 2015 between bankers on the deal amounted to an agreement to not tell investors that underwriters were buying some of the stock. But Herbert-Smith, who was on the calls, told a Sydney court in a pre-trial hearing that the staff of the three banks decided to withhold information about the share sale independently and there was no agreement. “I had 30 seconds’ notice, and three seconds to make up my mind,” Herbert-Smith said of one of the calls. “I was flying blind on the phone call.” Seven months later, in March 2016, when he was told the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) wanted to speak to him, Herbert-Smith said, “I couldn’t believe it, I was somewhat surprised”. Herbert-Smith’s lawyer, Philip Strickland, asked: “You didn’t consider that you were involved in cartel behavior, is that correct?” “That’s correct,” Herbert-Smith responded. According to his lawyer, Herbert-Smith told other bankers on the call that “we are comfortable with our risk position (and) we are going to stand on it”. “There was no prior agreement ... relating to those lines you’ve just recited,” Herbert-Smith said. Herbert-Smith said that when he met an ACCC investigator in March 2016, the investigator found it hard to believe three people on the same call made the same decision independently. “I disagreed. Maybe it was familiarity with capital markets,” he said. Defence lawyers have been questioning Herbert-Smith and two other JPMorgan staffers involved in the stock issue to determine how they came to give their sworn witness statements and who was involved. The defense has previously suggested the JPMorgan evidence may have been contaminated by the involvement of the ACCC and other regulators. On Thursday, Herbert-Smith said he met the ACCC about six times before signing a statement that would be used to prosecute the other banks, he said. The banks and their staff and former staff have declined to comment on the case outside of what is said in court. All of the accused have said they will defend the case, which is yet to go to trial, but none has entered a formal plea. The hearing will resume on Friday."

The testimony from former JPMorgan Chase & Co markets head Jeff Herbert-Smith in court is a blow to the prosecution, which is relying on JPMorgan to support a case that the three global investment banks engaged in criminal cartel behaviour in a A$2.5 billion share issue for Australia and New Zealand Banking Group in 2015. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), which brought the charges, accuses Citi and Deutsche and their client, Australia’s fourth-largest bank, of withholding details of the sale to support the stock’s price. JPMorgan was given immunity in exchange for cooperating with the authorities. In pretrial hearings in Sydney, three senior JPMorgan staffers said they began discussing possible immunity deals with the ACCC in 2016 and wrote witness statements months later. Herbert-Smith said he first met the ACCC over the stock issue in March 2016, seven months after the capital raising, and agreed to provide a frank account of his role in it. But he said he rejected an ACCC investigator’s suggestion that the three banks had colluded in a recorded phone call during the capital raising. “I disagreed and stood my ground,” Herbert-Smith told a packed courtroom. “In relation to the part of the call (between the bankers) where people said they would stay out of the market of the day... it was not an agreement.” “It was three independent positions which happened to be the same,” he added. The three investment banks and ANZ have declined to comment on the matter outside of what is said in court. Herbert-Smith left the bank in February 2016, according to his LinkedIn page. JPMorgan’s Australian head of trading, Mark Dewar, also spoke at the hearing, describing more than a year of meetings with the ACCC over drafting the witness statement he signed. In a meeting over three days in October 2016, Dewar, who still holds his position at JPMorgan, said ACCC staff showed him a draft on a screen “so everybody could see”. He said he gave notes verbally while an ACCC staffer wrote them down. After several more meetings, he signed the statement in April 2017, he said. “I probably needed a holiday after that,” he added. The ACCC ultimately brought the charges in June 2018 against Citi, Deutsche and ANZ, and their former executives. All the banks have said they will defend themselves against the charges and declined to comment further on the case outside of court."

-6.974868802012331," Deteriorating bond supply/demand balance to push up borrowing costs in 2020 - JPMorgan LONDON, Dec 2 (Reuters) - Number crunchers at JPMorgan have predicted global borrowing costs are likely to rise next year due to a deterioration of around $465 billion in the worldwide bond supply and demand balance. They calculate that, despite buying from major central banks like the ECB, there will be a $840 billion reduction in bond demand in 2020 against a $375 billion decrease in bond supply. “This implies upward pressure on bond yields next year, particularly if our estimates of bond fund demand and G4 (US, Eurozone, Japan, UK) commercial bank bond purchases for 2020 prove correct,” JPMorgan’s analysts wrote in a note. Next year should also break a four-year trend of rising global bond supply. The $375 billion reduction predicted by JPMorgan reflects both a decline in net government supply in the United States and a reduction of corporate issuance. Companies globally are trying to rein in their debt having pre-financed on the back of record-low interest rates in recent years. This year has seen bond supply rise to just over $3.1 trillion, the highest level since 2009. Over the past four years, annual global bond supply has gone up by almost $1 trillion. On the demand side, the two surprises this year have been the strength of bond fund demand by retail investors and the extent of bond purchases by G4 commercial banks.

7.2604987636008245," MOVES-JPMorgan hires bankers for new venture capital coverage team NEW YORK, Nov 5 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co said on Tuesday that it hired a team of four bankers to lead a new team in its commercial bank that connects venture capital investors with fast-growing start-ups in technology, life sciences and other fields. Venture capital firms have long been a critical source of funds for the U.S. start-ups, and the new hires have decades of combined experience working with VC firms at Silicon Valley Bank. Called the venture capital coverage team, the group will serve as a bridge between VC investors and the middle market and specialized industries bankers who cover the kinds of companies in which the firms are already invested or may want to invest in the future. Led by Pamela Aldsworth, the group will include Andy Kelly, Katie Taormino and Dave Reich, all of whom joined JPMorgan from Silicon Valley Bank. Aldsworth and Reich will be based in Boston, while Kelly and Taormino will be based in the San Francisco Bay area. “Venture capital is the lifeblood of the innovation economy, and we will be able to bring the unmatched solutions, network and global connections clients need to be successful,” said Aldsworth. Earlier this year the bank combined two units in the commercial bank, the middle-market technology and emerging growth commercial banking teams, to help it better compete to handle the business of start-ups that quickly become big companies.

15.367637830761293," JPMorgan's Dimon says Facebook's Libra currency 'will never happen' WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Facebook’s Libra digital currency project is “a neat idea that will never happen,” JPMorgan Chase Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said on Friday, adding to scepticism about the project that has faced criticism from policymakers and some regulators. Dimon, who made the comments at an event in Washington hosted by the Institute of International Finance, did not elaborate on why he believed Libra was a non-starter. But the Wall Street Journal reported this week that JPMorgan had declined to join the project due to concerns the digital currency could be used for criminal activities that would violate money-laundering and sanctions rules. The ambitious efforts of Facebook Inc to establish a global digital currency have suffered severe setbacks in recent weeks, after several high profile partners including Visa, Mastercard, PayPal and eBay abandoned the project. The exodus followed a pushback from policymakers and regulators in the United States and Europe over concerns Libra could upend the global financial system, threaten users’ privacy and facilitate money laundering. David Marcus, a Facebook executive who has been leading the project, said this week he expected to get 100 banks and financial firms on board once the project has addressed regulatory concerns.. Speaking to reporters Thursday night, Marcus said Libra did not need banks or payment firms to launch the system, however. He added that Libra intended to meet the highest possible regulatory standards, if not exceed them. Dimon has in the past been a vocal critic of cryptocurrencies and described bitcoin as a “fraud” in 2017. Back then Dimon said cryptocurrencies were “worse than tulips bulbs,” referring to a famous market bubble in the 1600s. He tempered his view a few months later, saying he regretted calling bitcoin a fraud, but maintained his disinterest in cryptocurrencies. Still, JPMorgan made its own foray into the digital asset space in February, launching a “JPM Coin” to allow its clients to instantly transfer payments over a blockchain network. In a presentation on its website at the time, JPMorgan said it was supportive of “cryptocurrencies as long as they are properly controlled and regulated.”"

14.703008226976353," JPMorgan beats profit estimates, says consumer remains strong (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N kicked off bank earnings on Tuesday by beating Wall Street estimates for quarterly profit by a wide margin, a signal that the U.S. consumer remains strong, executives at the largest U.S. bank said. Strength in bond trading and underwriting boosted revenue here at three of the bank's four main businesses, allaying concerns about the impact of an escalating U.S.-China trade war, slowing global growth and low interest rates. “It does look like geopolitics, particularly around China and trade, are reducing business confidence,” Chief Executive Jamie Dimon told reporters on a conference call, adding that current consumer financial strength is “very powerful.” “The consumer is not under strain. The consumer is doing fine,” Dimon said. He said that although job growth has slowed slightly, “it is still positive and it may very well not go negative.” The only business to report a fall in revenue was commercial banking, where lower interest rates hampered results. Overall, revenue rose 8% to $30.06 billion, well above the average analyst estimate of $28.49 billion, on the back of better-than-expected results in the bank's bond trading business, where revenue surged 25%. Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N also reported a rise in revenue from the business. Oppenheimer analyst Chris Kotowski described JPMorgan’s results as “solid,” noting that trading and investment banking results were strong, credit metrics held up well and that the bank managed to produce higher interest income even as rates declined. “Nothing not to like,” Kotowski wrote in a note. Strength in bond trading helped offset weakness in equity trading, which it blamed on lower derivatives trading and M&A advisory fees. The bank’s net income for the quarter ended Sept. 30 was $9.08 billion, or $2.68 per share, compared with $8.38 billion, or $2.34 per share, a year ago. Analysts, on average, had expected the bank to earn $2.45 per share, according to Refinitiv data. Shares were up 2.9% at $119.84 in morning trading."

The debt package may include at least $2 billion of unsecured notes with a 15% coupon, Bloomberg reported. The report said that WeWork preferred the JPMorgan package over a stake sale to SoftBank, which already owns around one-third of the company, because it would not dilute the stakes of top private shareholders. The Bloomberg report cited people familiar with the matter. SoftBank and WeWork declined to comment on the report. JPMorgan did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Reuters reported earlier in October that WeWork and JPMorgan were negotiating a debt deal after the company postponed last month’s initial public offering as investor concerns grew about its valuation and its business model. Reuters reported on Sunday, citing a source, that SoftBank had prepared a financing package that would significantly increase its one-third stake and further dilute the influence of co-founder Adam Neumann. The Guardian newspaper reported early on Tuesday that WeWork is expected to sack at least 2,000 people as early as this week. In recent weeks, the cash-strapped office-sharing company has seen its credit ratings being downgraded deeper into junk territory by global credit rating agencies Standard & Poor’s and Fitch Ratings. WeWork lost $1.9 billion in 2018 and burned through $2.36 billion in cash in the first half of this year, according to U.S. filings.

18.89168776673258," Wall Street Week Ahead: Bruised U.S. banks expected to report third quarter earnings decline NEW YORK (Reuters) - The biggest U.S. banks are expected to kick off the earnings season on a sour note next week due to falling interest rates, which may have pressured net interest margins enough to cause the sector’s first year-over-year earnings per share decline in three years. While strength in mortgage banking and cheap valuations could provide support to the S&P 500 bank index, its performance depends on what reassurance executives provide on credit conditions, the outlook for loan growth and their ability to reduce deposit costs during their conference calls. Tuesday brings third quarter profit reports from Citigroup Inc, Wells Fargo and Co, JPMorgan Chase & Co, and Goldman Sachs. Bank of America reports on Wednesday. The biggest U.S. banks will report a 1.2% decline in third-quarter earnings, while revenue is seen rising 0.9%, according to data aggregated by Refinitiv analyst David Aurelio. This would be the first profit decline since the same quarter in 2016, according to data from Factset. “Overall it’s shaping up to be a pretty challenging quarter because of the net interest rate environment,” said Fred Cannon, director of research for Keefe, Bruyette & Woods in New York, citing the flattening and temporary inversion of the U.S. Treasury 2-year/10-year yield curve during the quarter. Bank profits depend heavily on net interest income, or the difference between the rate they charge for long-term loans and the rate they pay for short-term borrowing. Executives from Citi, Wells Fargo and JPMorgan all cut their full-year forecasts for net interest income last month, citing macroeconomic concerns. Part of the problem is U.S. Federal Reserve interest rate cuts in July and September. And futures traders are betting on more Fed rate cuts going forward, including one in October. As a result, bank investors will listen for executive reassurance on the net interest margin outlook and their ability to mitigate weakness, said Manulife Investment Management’s Lisa Welch, who manages the John Hancock Regional Bank Fund. One offset to lower lending profits would be a reduction in interest rates banks pay their customers for deposits, as those rates rose while the Fed was hiking interest rates. “There’s going to be a lot of questions on how fast banks are able to bring down their deposit costs as loan yields are coming down,” said Welch, adding that she does not expect deposit costs “to come down as quickly as loan yields have fallen.” Mortgages may be another silver lining to lower rates in third-quarter numbers and future quarters as borrowers avail of cheaper rates. Refinancing, which accounts for most mortgage applications, has more than doubled from a year ago, according to Mortgage Bankers Association data released on Wednesday. “With rates being lower, we think mortgage activity will be very strong,” said Welch, pointing to First Horizon as one bank that could benefit from mortgage demand. Bank of America and Wells Fargo should also benefit, according to KBW’s Cannon. To cope with rising demand, Wells Fargo is boosting its mortgage team, according to a memo seen by Reuters this week. But investors will also be on high alert for signs slowing U.S. economic growth is hurting debt repayments, said Mike Cronin, investment manager at Aberdeen Standard Investments. “Given that we’ve had some economic data that’s been a little weaker is there any trend in credit costs that raises concerns going into 2020?” said Cronin. So far, strong credit quality and bank balance sheets have reassured KBW’s Cannon, who is neutral on the sector. “But if we start to see meaningful credit deterioration that would change our minds about how we think about the banks,” he said. Cannon did not recommend buying banks going into earnings season due to the likelihood “consensus estimates come down in the quarter.” But on the plus side, he said, valuations do seem to reflect an expectation for further weakness. (GRAPHIC - S&P bank index valuation vs S&P 500: ) The S&P Bank index has gained 14% year-to-date, compared with a 16.5% advance for the S&P 500. But the sector’s trading multiple of 10.2 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months compares well to its historical average of 12.6 and the benchmark S&P’s current trading multiple of 16.4. Bank valuations look attractive to Manulife’s Welch, who does not expect a recession any time soon. “If we’re wrong and go into a mild recession we think the banks will hold up much better” than going into financial crisis, she said, citing underwriting improvements. But, after a spate of weak manufacturing data, Aberdeen Standard’s Cronin is looking for data to stabilize before recommending the sector. “There is a lot of downside priced into the stocks but overall I’d still say I’m not really positive on the group just yet,” he said."

Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said on Thursday a withdrawal agreement could be clinched by the end of October, which would allow the United Kingdom to leave the European Union in an orderly fashion. EU negotiator Michel Barnier and his British counterpart Stephen Barclay, meanwhile, held a “constructive” meeting on Friday, both the British and EU sides said. The pound, British stocks, bonds, and Irish government bonds rallied as investors scrambled to cover short positions, with the British currency hitting its highest levels in more than three months. It was trading at $1.2675 at 1500 GMT. [GBP/] Deutsche Bank said it was no longer negative on the pound. “This represents a significant change of tune by the Irish government, that has so far been relatively pessimistic about the prospect of talks moving forward,” Deutsche’s foreign exchange strategist, Oliver Harvey, told clients. JPMorgan, meanwhile, predicted a deal would be struck, noting the two sides appeared to have found a solution to the thorny Irish border issue. The bank now sees a 50% chance of a withdrawal agreement being struck with a “modified/time-limited” Irish “backstop” that could get round a major sticking point over customs and border arrangements between Ireland and the UK province of Northern Ireland. It had previously put the likelihood at just 5%. Some remain doubtful. For one, time is short and any deal British Prime Minister Boris Johnson brings back from Brussels will need the British parliament’s approval, including from hardline pro-Brexit factions. The British government is therefore likely to request an extension to the Brexit deadline and then hold a general election, UBS Wealth Management said. But it acknowledged that the chances of a Brexit agreement had nonetheless increased. “The chances of a deal seem to have improved and the pound has moved accordingly but hurdles still remain,” said Dean Turner, economist at the wealth manager. “Time to thrash out the details of the deal are tight, and then there is the question of parliamentary approval.” A deal would prolong the rally in the pound, Turner said, predicting sterling would hit $1.35 and trade in the “low 80s” against the euro if there was an agreement. Morgan Stanley upped its chances of a Brexit deal to 55% from 35% before the latest developments. The investment bank said a deal would be negotiable if London agreed to a customs border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom, although it was uncertain such an arrangement would be approved by the current parliament. “We continue to see elections as the most plausible mechanism to decide the way forward on Brexit and expect them to be held before Brexit,” the bank’s economists Jacob Nell and Brunca Skarica wrote in a note to clients. “However, given that a Johnson government seems to have switched to supporting a negotiable deal, we now see a significantly reduced risk of a no-deal outcome after elections, since even a Johnson government would prefer an orderly exit to a no-deal outcome.” Goldman Sachs was ahead of the bunch, however, sending a recommendation late last Friday for clients to buy sterling against the dollar, with a target of $1.30 compared with the then spot pound value of around $1.23. It assessed the probabilities of a Brexit deal being struck at 60%. Political risk consultancy Eurasia Group raised its probability of a Brexit deal from 5% to 10%. But barriers to one were still substantial, it cautioned."

24.10028466002575," Canadian M&A slides in third quarter, cannabis deals drop TORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian M&A activity fell by 31% in the third quarter to its lowest in eight quarters and initial public offerings also slowed, according to Refinitiv data, with economic headwinds and a decline in cannabis deals among the drivers. M&A involving Canadian players totaled $49.7 billion (C$66.07 billion) in the three months to Sept. 30, the data showed, while IPOs raised $774 million in the quarter. Deals in the first three quarters of 2019 slid to $157 billion, the lowest level since 2014, compared with $200.6 billion for the corresponding period in 2018. Trade and economic uncertainties meant companies were “less confident and therefore less interested in acting,” said David Rawlings, Chief Executive Officer for Canada at JP Morgan Chase & Co, although he noted a high base for comparison. “We’ve normalized from some really high activity a couple of years ago to a more normal run rate now,” Rawlings told Reuters. He said activity over the next 12 to 18 months could remain fairly consistent with the levels so far this year. Most companies have healthy cash flow and balance sheets and access to financing, and investors are still active, Rawlings said. Investment and private equity firms including Brookfield Asset Management BAMa.TO, Blackstone Group BX.N and Canada Pension Plan Investment Board were involved in four of the quarter's five biggest deals. TD Securities led financial advisors with $36.3 billion of M&A deals. Osler Hoskin & Harcourt topped legal advisors with deals worth $41.3 billion. A fall in cannabis deals also contributed to the decline in M&A activity. The biggest marijuana deal, Constellation Brands' $4 billion investment into Canopy Growth WEED.TO, was announced in the third quarter of 2018. “In the cannabis space, there has been a significant (stock) market adjustment over the past few months,” said Jonathan Sherman, co-chair of law firm Cassels Brock’s cannabis group. “From an M&A and deal-flow perspective, companies are also hesitant to dive into something given the political uncertainty you have right now,” he said, pointing to a Canadian federal election on Oct. 21. The biggest deals announced during the quarter included Blackstone funds' $4.2 billion acquisition of Dream Global Real Estate Investment Trust DRG_u.TO and BC Partners' purchase of a 51% stake in Garda World Security. Equity raisings doubled to $10.4 billion in the third quarter from a year earlier, while debt deals rose 12% to $42.8 billion."
18.774411580710463," Ex-JPMorgan Australia executives named as prosecution witnesses in bank cartel case SYDNEY (Reuters) - Two former senior executives of investment bank JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N in Australia were named on Wednesday as prosecution witnesses in a criminal cartel case by the state against rivals Citigroup C.N and Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE. A senior investigator at antitrust regulator the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) was also named in a court hearing as a witness in the country’s biggest prosecution of alleged white collar crime. The investment banks are accused of colluding over a A$3 billion ($2 billion) capital raising. The local units of JPMorgan, Citi and Deutsche all worked on a share issue for the country's then third-largest bank Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd ANZ.AX in 2015. Last year, the ACCC brought charges against Citi, Deutsche, ANZ and several of those companies’ top employees alleging they colluded to keep from regular shareholders the fact that the issue was undersubscribed. The previously undisclosed involvement of witnesses who worked at JPMorgan, which was not charged, raises the chances the case will involve global investment banks testifying against each other when it goes to trial, as well as defending themselves against government prosecutors. The lawyer for Citi’s former Australia head, Stephen Roberts, named as witnesses Richard Galvin, JPMorgan’s former head of equity and derivative capital markets, and Jeffrey Herbert-Smith, JPMorgan’s former managing director and head of markets, in an application to be allowed to cross-examine them. Roberts’ lawyer, Robert Dick, told the court he wanted to question the two ex-JPMorgan people on written statements about Roberts’ participation in a phone call at the time of the capital raising. Herbert-Smith’s statement gave only limited detail about Roberts’ involvement in the phone call while Galvin’s statement made “no reference to Mr Roberts saying anything at all”, Dick told the court. “Is this a case that says ‘by silence Mr Roberts is said to have consented to something’?” Dick said. “We should be entitled to know.” Between the two witness statements, “there’s not a shred of material that explains to us what that involves,” Dick said. A JPMorgan spokesman declined to comment, while Galvin and Herbert-Smith did not respond to requests for comment on LinkedIn. Both left the bank in 2016. Lawyers for Citi, Deutsche and ANZ also said they want to cross-examine the ACCC’s general manager of financial services competition, Leah Won, also named publicly as a witness for the first time. An ACCC spokeswoman declined to comment on Won’s behalf. Prosecution lawyers said they would respond to requests to allow their witnesses to be cross-examined when the matter returns to court on Sept. 27. All the people and companies charged in the case have said they will plead not guilty, but no trial date has been set."

The investment also shows that the bank is betting that supporting finance apps and having meeting spaces for community groups in its branches could result in more new customers. A newly renovated Harlem branch bank on West 125th Street is passed more than 1 million pedestrians weekly, and the bank redesigned it to have several meeting rooms that can be reserved for free by people and businesses in the community. This is a new take on a trend started by other banks like Capital One, which converted several of its branches into cafes in a bid to drive more people into the bank’s costly brick and mortar locations. JPMorgan’s location has a storefront where local entrepreneurs can hold pop-up shops, as local retailer and hat maker Flamekeepers Hat Club did in August. The bank plans to open five more branches like the Harlem branch, next in Los Angeles."
16.335013388737163," Russian man pleads guilty in U.S. to role in hacking scheme that targeted JPMorgan NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Russian man pleaded guilty on Monday to U.S. charges he took part in a massive computer hacking scheme that targeted JPMorgan Chase & Co and other financial services companies. Andrei Tyurin, 36, pleaded guilty in Manhattan federal court to six counts including wire fraud and computer hacking conspiracy, admitting that he illegally obtained the personal information of the companies’ customers to find potential victims for fraudulent investment schemes. He is scheduled to be sentenced on Feb. 13 by U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain in Manhattan. He has agreed to forfeit more than $19 million as part of his plea. His lawyer, Florian Miedel, declined to comment on the case. Tyurin was arrested in the country of Georgia at the request of U.S. authorities last year, the latest of several people to be charged with taking part in the scheme. JPMorgan disclosed that it had been hacked in 2014, saying it had exposed information associated with about 83 million customer accounts. Other victims included E*Trade Financial Corp, Scottrade Inc and News Corp’s Dow Jones & Co, publisher of the Wall Street Journal. Prosecutors said a total of more than 100 million customers of the hacked companies were affected. Prosecutors had previously charged two Israeli citizens, Gery Shalon and Ziv Orenstein, along with an American resident of Israel, Joshua Samuel Aaron, in connection with the scheme. Members of the conspiracy made hundreds of millions of dollars through criminal schemes using stolen information, prosecutors said."

Dimon, who was speaking to reporters in Washington, said he did not believe recent issues in the U.S. repurchase agreement market were immediately worrying, but suggested underlying issues that should be addressed. “It’s not a big deal given that it happened in good times. If we don’t fix the underlying problem, it will hurt the economy in bad times,” he said. Dimon said that banks have a “tremendous amount” of liquidity, but are constrained in how they can use it when rates consistently fluctuate. (Reporting by Katanga Johnson, Editing by Franklin Paul)"
16.187199049420283," JPMorgan says UK unlikely to get a Brexit deal at October summit LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. investment bank JPMorgan said on Wednesday it was negative about the prospects of Prime Minister Boris Johnson striking a Brexit deal at the Oct. 17-18 EU summit. “Our reading of the situation is much more negative than positive as far as the prospects of a revised Withdrawal Agreement being agreed at the October summit are concerned,” it said in a note to clients. “The UK’s negotiating approach appears to be to present the details of its proposals late in the process, and to use the brute force of a no-deal threat to force the EU to accept them,” JPMorgan said. “The very limited credibility of that threat adds to reasons why such a brute-force approach is not going to work.” Johnson has said he can get a deal at the summit though he has cautioned that if he does not, the United Kingdom will leave on Oct. 31 without a deal. JPMorgan’s Malcolm Barr said reports of a shift in the position of the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party - which props up Johnson’s government - were misplaced. “Time is increasingly short,” the note said. “Any deal that had ‘alternative arrangements’ at its heart would be a complex one, given the EU’s demand that a well-defined and legally operative ‘solution’ for Ireland be included in the Withdrawal Agreement.”"

16.180086878786536," U.S. charges JPMorgan metals traders over alleged market manipulation WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Department of Justice charged two current and one former JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N executives on Monday with alleged racketeering and manipulating prices of metals such as gold, silver, platinum and palladium between 2008 and 2016. The charges came from an “ongoing” investigation into alleged fraudulent trading practices at JPMorgan that generated “millions of dollars in profit” for the bank and “tens of millions of dollars of losses” for its customers, said Brian Benczkowski, an assistant attorney general. The three men – global precious metals desk head Michael Nowak, precious metals trader Gregg F. Smith, and former trader Christopher Jordan, who left JPMorgan in 2009 – were charged with a racketeering conspiracy and other federal crimes, the Department of Justice said in a statement. The cases relate to spoofing, which involves placing bids to buy or offers to sell contracts with the intent to cancel them before execution, allowing spoofers to influence prices to their benefit. There has been a surge in spoofing-related prosecutions in the United States in recent years. Two former JPMorgan metals traders, Christiaan Trunz and John Edmonds, already pled guilty to similar charges as part of the same investigation. A spokesman for JPMorgan declined to comment. One of the largest gold traders in the world, the bank said in an August regulatory filing it was “responding to and cooperating with” investigations by various authorities, including the Department of Justice, relating to trading practices in the metals markets. Nowak’s attorneys, David Meister and Jocelyn Strauber of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP, said Nowak “has done nothing wrong” and expect him to be fully exonerated. Smith and Jordan did not respond to requests for comment. Separately, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission said on Monday it has charged Nowak and Smith for spoofing and manipulating prices in the precious metals futures market. In a statement and in the indictment, prosecutors described how the trio executed “thousands” of unlawful trading sequences that included “layering” deceptive orders at different prices in rapid succession. Prosecutors also described attempts to influence market prices toward specific price points to trigger or avoid triggering options. An option is a financial instrument that gives buyers the right to buy or sell an underlying asset at an agreed price and at a fixed time. Its value is tied to the value of the underlying asset. While previous spoofing prosecutions have led to guilty pleas, in a similar case a former metals trader at the Swiss bank, UBS Group UBSG.S, was acquitted by a jury last year, highlighting the difficulties in making a case that canceling orders is a criminal act given that many market orders go unfilled. Reuters reported on Sept. 12 that Nowak and Smith had been placed on leave from JPMorgan in connection with the ongoing investigation. “This is, in our view, a very strong case, and as strong a case as we’ve seen in this area,” said Benczkowski. “We believe that there were millions of dollars in profit, at least to the bank, and tens of millions of dollars of losses (to customers) The case was filed with the U.S. District Court in Chicago, and was unsealed on Monday, the Department of Justice said."

On Monday, top brass from Citi and Wells Fargo tempered their outlooks for net interest income. Citi now expects net interest income to be up 3% to 4% for the year, compared with prior guidance of 4% growth. Wells Fargo lowered its projections for the second time this year. The bank’s chief financial officer said it expects net interest income to fall 6% in 2019, compared with 5% stated previously. Dimon also said JPMorgan Chase expects third-quarter trading revenues to be 10% lower than in the second quarter, while fees from mergers and acquisitions will likely be flat in comparison with the prior quarter."

The guilty plea and resignation of Christian Trunz, 34, of London, were announced by the U.S. Department of Justice. Trunz admitted in the federal court in Brooklyn, New York, to having from July 2007 to August 2016 at JPMorgan and another bank placed thousands of orders for gold, platinum and palladium futures contracts that he never intended to complete. While the Justice Department did not identify the banks by name in court papers, Trunz had worked for JPMorgan since at least 2008, according to the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority’s BrokerCheck database. Lawyers for Trunz did not immediately respond to requests for comment. A spokeswoman for JPMorgan declined to comment. Trunz’s plea followed a guilty plea to spoofing last October by another JPMorgan trader, John Edmonds, in a Connecticut federal court. The Justice Department said Trunz, who worked in New York, London and Singapore, learned about spoofing from more senior traders and engaged in the practice with the consent of his immediate supervisors. U.S. prosecutors have charged several other traders with spoofing, and their probe into the practice is continuing. JPMorgan said in a Feb. 26 regulatory filing that it was cooperating with the probe. Trunz pleaded guilty to one count of spoofing and one count of conspiracy to engage in spoofing. His sentencing is scheduled for Feb. 19, 2020. Edmonds has yet to be sentenced. The case is U.S. v Trunz, U.S. District Court, Eastern District of New York, No. 19-cr-00375."

WeWork would like work on the debt offering to begin as early as next week, although this is subject to change as there are regulatory hurdles to be cleared, the sources said.

WeWork is looking to raise $5 billion to $6 billion through the bond offering and is then looking to go public as soon as September, Reuters reported last month. Leading the WeWork IPO would be a coup for JPMorgan and means it would occupy the lead spot on two of the three largest IPOs of 2019, having led preparations for the Lyft Inc LYFT.O listing in March. Rival Morgan Stanley MS.N was the lead bank on the Uber Technologies Inc UBER.N IPO in May.

5.97869553458322," Former JPMorgan senior banker pleads not guilty to Hong Kong bribery charges HONG KONG (Reuters) - A former JPMorgan JPM.N Asia investment banking vice-chair, Catherine Leung, pleaded not guilty to charges of bribery in a Hong Kong court on Thursday. Leung was charged in May by Hong Kong’s Independent Commission Against Corruption with bribing the then chairman of a potential client, a logistics company, by employing his son at the U.S. investment bank. While Hong Kong's anti-corruption watchdog did not name the company or the chairman at the time, the prosecution in the Leung case said on Thursday that she had ""offered advantages"" to Keng-lam Ang, chairman of Kerry Logistics Network Ltd 0636.HK. Leung did that in anticipation that Ang would return the favor by influencing Kerry Logistics and its parent Kerry Properties Ltd 0683.HK to give business to JPMorgan, the prosecution alleged in its summary of facts. Leung did not comment when approached by Reuters outside the court room. Ang and his son could not be immediately reached for comment via their current employer. A Kerry Logistics representative said in an email that Ang stepped down from Kerry Logistics Network Limited’s chairmanship in August 2012, and that JPMorgan did not participate in Kerry Logistics’ IPO in December 2013. A spokeswoman for Kerry Properties did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokeswoman for JPMorgan declined to comment and instead referred to the bank’s statement made when Leung was charged in May that said: “This is a historical case, which J.P. Morgan reached agreement on and settled in 2016”. JPMorgan agreed to pay U.S. authorities $264 million in 2016 here resolve allegations it hired the relatives of Chinese officials - dubbed ""princelings"" - to win banking deals. The bank did not admit or deny the charges. As part of its settlement with the U.S. Justice Department, a Hong Kong unit of the bank admitted to making quid pro quo hiring agreements with Chinese officials to win investment business. U.S. authorities at the time said JPMorgan’s Asia unit created an elaborate program, called “Sons and Daughters”, that allowed clients and influential government officials to recommend potential hires. “BLINK BLINK, NOD NOD” Leung was vice-chair of Asia investment banking when she left JPMorgan in February 2015. She first joined JPMorgan in 1994, according to her LinkedIn profile, and left to join rival Merrill Lynch in 2001, before rejoining JPMorgan in 2002. In 2009, Kerry Properties 0683.HK decided to spin out and list Kerry Logistics 0636.HK in Hong Kong. Leung liaised with top company executives for the IPO and other services that JPMorgan could offer, the prosecution summary showed. Having considered the existing and potential business opportunities from Kerry Logistics, Leung allegedly sought to offer the chairman’s son, Ang Ren-yi, a job with JPMorgan under the bank’s “Sons and Daughters” program, the summary said. Kerry Logistics is “close to mandating banks for their IPO. We are a strong contender. Blink Blink nod nod, can we find a place for his son ...”, Leung allegedly wrote in an internal email to her colleagues on Jan. 10, 2010. Leung arranged interviews for the son and persuaded her colleagues to hire him, the prosecution summary said, adding that Ang Ren-yi was given a job contract starting from June. 28, 2010 as an analyst with the bank in Hong Kong. Ang Ren-yi resigned from JPMorgan on Oct 28, 2011. Management of Kerry Logistics said they did not allow Ang, or any employee, to accept advantages from JPMorgan staff as rewards for showing favor to JPMorgan, the document shows. Leung’s trial has been set to start on Feb. 25, 2020, and will continue for eight days, Glen Kong, prosecutor, said. Kong asked the judge to consider merging Leung’s case with that of another ongoing investigation as the two share a similar witness list. No arrests have been made in the other case but the suspect, currently in mainland China, is likely to return to Hong Kong, Kong said. Details of the case were not available. Judge WK Kwok did not immediately make a decision about merging the two cases."

4.793883412350317," JPMorgan beats profit estimates but shows signs of pressure (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N reported a quarterly profit that beat estimates on Tuesday as higher interest income and consumer lending offset lower activity at its trading desks. But even as the biggest U.S. bank reported record earnings, there were warning signs across Wall Street that the playing field is beginning to tilt against the financial industry. Like Citigroup C.N on Monday and Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N on Tuesday, JPMorgan reported its net interest margin declined to 2.49% from 2.57% a year ago, as deposit rates and the rate the bank pays for other borrowings both rose. JPMorgan also lowered its outlook for net interest income to “about $57.5 billion” in 2019 from the $58 billion to $60 billion projection executives gave in February. While Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon maintained a bullish outlook about the U.S. economy as a whole, he conceded that uncertainties relating to global trade, which tend to impact trading volumes, were a drag. “The consumer in the United States is doing fine,” Dimon said on a conference call. “Business sentiment is a little bit worse, mostly driven by the trade war. But...I wouldn’t get too pessimistic.” Average loans rose 2%, driven largely by JPMorgan’s consumer bank, Chase, which reported credit card loans were up 2% and credit card sales surged 11%. The cost of handling that credit was flat. Overall income from the consumer and community banking, JPMorgan’s largest business, rose 22% to $4.17 billion, which offset declines across other businesses. Total net interest income, the difference between what banks pay on deposits and earn on loans, rose 7% to $14.40 billion. Net income climbed 16% to $9.65 billion as a tax gain and higher net interest income overshadowed lower activity on its trading desks. Excluding the tax gain, it earned $2.59 per share. Net revenue rose 4% to $29.57 billion.

The biggest U.S. bank by assets launched its robo-adviser on Wednesday with a minimum account balance of $2,500 and an annual fee of 0.35%, or 35 basis points, of assets. You Invest Head Jed Laskowitz said that during the year they spent testing the product with a select group of employees and bank clients, customers frequently said that lack of funds was a major reason they did not invest. “We wanted to get the minimums to as low as possible,” said Laskowitz. “We hope to get to below $1,000 next year.” The low-cost investment platform matches customers with portfolios of the bank’s exchange traded funds (ETFs) based on their risk tolerance and financial priorities. Customers pay an annual fee and receive rebates for any fees associated with the ETFs. The robo-adviser tool is an offshoot of You Invest, a self-directed investment platform the bank launched 10 months ago. Laskowitz did not say how many clients or assets You Invest has gathered so far.

0.16077654375033446," JP Morgan cuts Venezuela debt from popular bond benchmarks LONDON (Reuters) - JP Morgan will cut Venezuela’s sovereign and state oil firm PDVSA’s bonds to ‘zero weight’ in its widely-followed debt indexes over the next five months, the bank said on Tuesday, after U.S. sanctions halted nearly all trading in them. The U.S. investment bank’s index arm said the phasing-out process would start on July 31 and be completed by Nov. 29, although technically the debt will remain part of the indexes and pricing will also be maintained for the time being. Venezuela’s weight in the EMBI Global Diversified, EMBI Global and EMBI+ indices is currently 0.5%, 0.9% and 1.2% respectively. As a result of weighting cut, JP Morgan estimated the average yields on the EM indices would drop by some 45 basis points. It will now trigger forced selling of the bonds into what is already a largely frozen and illiquid market. Trading in Venezuelan and PDVSA debt [PDVSA.UL] ground to a halt this year after Washington imposed sweeping sanctions on Venezuela in a bid to force President Nicolas Maduro and his allies from power. “Those funds who do have the bonds will have to sell,” said Abhishek Kumar lead EM portfolio manager at State Street Global Advisors. “You do not want to be holding an overweight position in a country that is not in the benchmark.” He added it was likely to be a struggle as the sanctions mean they cannot be sold to U.S. investors. “There is always a buyer at the right price, but it will definitely be a time consuming process,” he said. That expectation of forces selling has seen Venezuela’s government bonds marked down to around 15 cents in the dollar from almost 30 cents early last month. PDVSA 2027 bonds are also trading at around 15 cents having been at 20 cents a month ago. Opposition leader Juan Guaido, who declared himself interim president on Jan. 23, has received the backing of the United States, along with most other countries in the western hemisphere. JP Morgan said it could open another index watch process in “the event of any favorable official guidance around easing of trading restrictions or consistent, observable improvements in liquidity and replicability of Venezuela bonds”."

The Highbridge fund, which is available to institutional and wealthy private investors, is part of JP Morgan’s $150 billion global alternatives business, which offers real estate, private equity, credit, infrastructure and hedge fund portfolios. As part of the change, one of the four lead portfolio managers, Arjun Menon, will be leaving the company. “As markets and clients evolve, we continue to innovate and examine our alternatives offering to ensure we deliver the solutions clients want and need today and into the future,” company spokesman Darin Oduyoye said, explaining the move. Three of the four key portfolio managers, Mark Vanacore and Jon Segal and Jason Hempel, who have been leading the multi-strategy credit business for the last decade, will stay with the fund. Investors will be allowed to shift their capital to the new fund or pull some or all of it out at a time the fund was delivering gains to investors. Exact returns for 2019 could not be learned. JPMorgan first bought a piece of Highbridge, co-founded by Glenn Dubin, in 2004 and purchased the rest five years later. In 2015 the lender agreed to sell the majority of Highbridge’s $22 billion private equity business to senior executives. Vanacore, who joined Highbridge at its founding in 1992, was named the chief investment officer for Highbridge Capital Management in 2012, a position he holds in addition to being a portfolio manager. Menon, who had concentrated on investing in Asian stocks, plans to launch his own fund in the future. As investors speculate that the bull market, which has pushed ahead for a decade, will inevitably slow in the months ahead, many investors are looking for alternatives and are showing signs of preferring more niche oriented strategies, fund managers and analysts have said."

8.670988455589145," RPT-Rallye debt losses burn JP Morgan and HSBC (Repeats for wider distribution. No change to text.) June 12 (IFR) - The pick-up in European corporate defaults continues to weigh on bank trading desks this quarter, with JP Morgan and HSBC on the hook for sizeable losses after French holding company Rallye entered bankruptcy protection last month. JP Morgan lost around US$25m on bonds and credit default swap positions related to Rallye, according to people familiar with the matter. HSBC lost about US$5m on its exposure to Rallye, one of those people said. Spokespeople for JP Morgan and HSBC declined to comment on the losses. The struggles at some of the finance industry’s largest bond trading units show how the recent increase in credit market volatility is creating winners and losers among the banks and funds that trade this market. IFR reported last week that JP Morgan had struggled this quarter in European high-yield trading. JP Morgan’s European high-yield credit trading desk, headed by Bhavit Sawjani, is known for not being averse to taking risk, having made tens of millions of dollars in revenues for the bank last year, according to people familiar with the matter. Elsewhere, one of Citigroup’s credit traders left its London office last month after racking up about US$10m in paper losses on CDS positions related to UK travel company Thomas Cook. By contrast, Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse have had particularly strong quarters in European high-yield after getting on the right side of some big moves in bonds and derivatives markets. Rallye, the holding company for French retailer Casino, has been one of the most high-profile companies to run into trouble this year in Europe. Investors had been scrutinising its finances for some time. Scott Goodwin, co-founder of New York-based hedge fund Diameter Capital Partners, recommended buying CDS protection on Rallye at the Sohn Investment Conference last year. Goodwin said the company was “burning a material amount of cash” and had a large amount of debt maturing in the next year. But the speed and scale of the slump in Rallye’s debt prices show how difficult it is for traders caught on the wrong side to cover their positions. The upfront cost of buying five-year CDS protection on Rallye leapt from 48 to 73 points overnight after the company entered creditor protection, according to data provider IHS Markit. That means the upfront fee a buyer of default protection would have paid to insure US$1m of Rallye debt rose from US$480,000 to US$730,000. The Credit Derivatives Determinations Committee, an industry body of banks and investors that rules on whether CDS contracts should pay out protection holders, voted last month that Rallye entering bankruptcy protection had triggered CDS. An auction to determine the size of those CDS payouts is scheduled to be held on June 27. (Reporting by Chris Whittall)"

JPMorgan plans to fold the existing Finn accounts into its Chase mobile app and said credentials such as account numbers and passwords would remain the same. The move comes at a time financial institutions across the United States have been looking to grow their consumer banking businesses by roping in younger customers though smartphone banking, aiming to cross-sell other financial products to them as their earnings increase.

3.341859766290958," JPMorgan's deposit growth slowing as customers seek higher yield NEW YORK (Reuters) - Deposit growth at JPMorgan Chase & Co, the largest U.S. bank by assets, is slowing as customers withdraw some of their money and stash it with competing banks that pay higher interest rates, a bank executive said Thursday. Most big U.S. banks have been slow to raise the interest rates they pay customers on their savings and deposits, despite the U.S. Federal Reserve setting current rates at between 2.25% and 2.5%. This has left an opening for some smaller and online-only banks that are trying to capitalize on customer frustration by offering savings accounts and other products that pay between 2% and 2.45% interest. Gordon Smith, co-president and chief operating officer for JPMorgan Chase, said that though customers are taking out money, and this is contributing to slowing in the bank’s deposit growth, most of those customers still keep Chase as their main bank. “People are taking a component of their deposits. They’re parking those deposits with a high-yield competitor, whomever they may be,” said Smith, also head of JPMorgan’s consumer and community banking. “That money is very liquid,” said Smith. “It’ll then move from that high-yield competitor to another ... but that high-yield competitor is not winning the primary bank relationship, which is obviously what’s critical.” Smith said the bank constantly reviews its deposit pricing and that interest rates are only part of what customers want from the bank."

-2.6792498802144586," Exclusive: JPMorgan cuts ties with OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma - sources (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co has cut ties with Purdue Pharma LP over the OxyContin maker’s alleged role in the U.S. opioid crisis, forcing it to find a new bank to manage cash and bill payments, people familiar with the matter said on Thursday. The move makes JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets, the most high-profile corporation known to have distanced itself from Purdue and its wealthy owners, the Sackler family, amid thousands of lawsuits alleging the company pushed addictive painkillers while downplaying their abuse and overdose risks. JPMorgan’s decision also underscores a drive among U.S. banks to reassess their relationships with clients and industries in response to controversy and political debates over matters such as immigration detention and mass shootings. After JPMorgan informed Purdue in March that it had six months to find another bank, Purdue tapped Dallas-based regional bank Comerica Inc to handle its financial transactions and accounts, the sources said. JPMorgan told Purdue that reputational risks associated with the public backlash against the drugmaker informed its decision to cut business ties, the sources added. While not a lender to Purdue, JPMorgan’s commercial bank managed the company’s cash and bill payments, according to the sources. It is not clear how long JPMorgan served as Purdue’s bank. “Purdue is a streamlined organization with an exciting pipeline of new medicines and significant cash reserves,” the company said in a statement. “The company has multiple banking relationships and will not have any interruption to its banking and financial service needs.” JPMorgan and Comerica declined to comment. Purdue faces roughly 2,000 lawsuits accusing the Stamford, Connecticut-based company, and increasingly the Sacklers, of aggressively marketing prescription opioids while misleading prescribers and consumers about risks from their prolonged use. U.S. states, counties and cities are seeking billions of dollars in damages to address harm from opioids. Nearly 400,000 people have died after overdosing on opioids between 1999 and 2017, according to the latest data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. More than half the deaths resulted from prescription painkillers. Purdue denies it contributed to the U.S. opioid crisis, pointing to U.S. Food and Drug Administration approvals of labels for the company’s drugs that carried warnings about risk and abuse associated with treating pain. Purdue and its family owners argue that heroin and fentanyl are currently more significant culprits in the opioid epidemic. However, health experts have said many people turn to those drugs after first getting hooked on prescription painkillers. In March, Purdue and the Sackler family reached a $270 million settlement with the state of Oklahoma, which on Tuesday is set to take two other drugmakers to trial over claims they also helped fuel the opioid epidemic. Dozens of other states have lawsuits pending against Purdue, and in some instances the Sacklers, who made a financial contribution to the Oklahoma settlement even though they were not defendants in the case. A North Dakota judge earlier this month dismissed that state’s case against Purdue. Purdue Chief Executive Officer Craig Landau in March said a bankruptcy filing remained an option for the company to address potential liabilities from widespread litigation. Various museums, universities and other nonprofits are now shunning donations or reassessing their relationships with the Sackler family, which has a long history of philanthropy. In New York, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, which has a wing named for the Sacklers, and the American Museum of Natural History, said earlier this month they had ceased accepting donations from the family. For JPMorgan, dropping Purdue is the latest in a series of moves aimed at steering clear of political lightning rods. In January, the bank said it would stop financing operators of private prisons, which have become the target of protests over their role detaining undocumented immigrants. Its peers have made similar moves. In March, Wells Fargo & Co’s CEO at the time, Tim Sloan, told a congressional panel the bank was exiting relationships with private prison operators. Citigroup Inc, meanwhile, last year placed restrictions on firearms sales for retailers doing business with the bank following the deadly school shooting in Parkland, Florida. A Bank of America Corp executive said last year that the bank intended to avoid financing military-style firearms for civilians moving forward."

-3.0056022172751615," JPMorgan shareholders approve executive pay, fewer votes than last year CHICAGO (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co said on Tuesday that only 72% of shareholder votes approved its executive compensation packages, marking unusual opposition to pay for the bank’s top leaders. About 93% supported JPMorgan’s executive pay last year. JPMorgan Chase also said all of its directors were elected, and that a shareholder proposal that the bank report annually on its global gender pay gap was voted down, according to preliminary tallies. The votes were taken at the bank’s annual shareholder meeting at its offices in Chicago. Around 29% of shareholder votes supported a proposal asking for more details on gender pay equity in the United States and some 28% of votes were in favor of a proposal aimed at easing shareholders’ access to proxy voting rights. ISS, the influential proxy advisory group, urged investors to vote against the bank’s executive pay packages in a report published earlier this month because it objected to the portion of pay that was discretionary. ISS advised investors to vote against the board’s pay packages for the bank’s top brass, including Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, twice before in 2011 and 2015, also over concerns about the portion of pay that was discretionary. Dimon, who has led the bank since 2005, received a total of $31 million in compensation for the year 2018. The bank’s board of directors had recommended that shareholders vote for executive compensation, and lead independent director Lee Raymond said the development and assessment of compensation was the board’s “top priority.” “We believe our performance-based incentive program and our balanced approach ... effectively align executive comp and shareholder value,” Raymond said, adding that the board will consider shareholders’ feedback. Dimon was peppered with questions during the meeting from climate change activists who criticized the bank’s funding of pipeline projects. The meeting was momentarily disrupted by protesters who chanted “Defund climate change, stop funding fossil fuels.” Wells Fargo analyst Mike Mayo asked the board and Dimon about the bank’s leadership succession plan. “JPMorgan has key man risk - that’s you,” Mayo said, indicating Dimon. “If I was hit by that truck ... we have people who are quite capable who can run this company. There are more than one. There are several who can do it,” Dimon said. “Our bigger fear is that they get recruited away by somebody else because they are very talented.” JPMorgan shares added 0.2 percent to $111.54."

Leung allegedly offered employment to the son of the chairman of a logistics company in 2010 and 2011 as a reward for the chairman favoring J.P. Morgan Securities (Asia Pacific) when choosing banks to work on the company’s IPO, Hong Kong’s Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) said in a statement on Thursday. Leung, currently at MizMaa Ventures, an Israeli-U.S. tech-focused venture capital firm she co-founded, did not immediately respond to a Reuters email sent via MizMaa requesting comment. Leung has been released on ICAC bail pending a scheduled appearance in a Hong Kong magistrates court on May 20, ICAC said. ICAC said that in 2010 and 2011, the times of the alleged offences, Leung was responsible for sourcing business for JP Morgan Securities (Asia Pacific) and its parent JPMorgan Chase & Co. A spokeswoman for JPMorgan said: “This is a historical case, which J.P. Morgan reached agreement on and settled in 2016.” “We strengthened our compliance procedures and controls around hiring and reinforced the high standards of conduct expected of our people,” the spokeswoman said in an emailed statement. In 2016, JPMorgan agreed to pay U.S. authorities $264 million to resolve allegations it hired the relatives of Chinese officials - dubbed “princelings” - to win banking deals, according to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the U.S. Justice Department. U.S. authorities at that time said JPMorgan’s Asia unit created an elaborate program, called “Sons and Daughters,” that allowed clients and influential government officials to recommend potential hires.

-3.59892302209409," JPMorgan Chase will invest $125 million in programs to encourage people to save money NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co will provide $125 million over the next five years to nonprofit groups in the United States and abroad that help people save, pay down debt and improve their credit scores, the bank said on Wednesday. The goal is to aid the expansion of nonprofits that help people become more financially secure and better able to weather financial hardships. The bank has committed more than $800 million in grants, donations and loans to promote urban renewal in cities including Paris, Detroit, Chicago and others, efforts that need financially stable citizens to succeed. “We see financial health as a cornerstone of inclusive growth in cities”, Colleen Briggs, head of community innovation at JPMorgan Chase’s corporate responsibility office, said in an interview. Families who have even a small amount of emergency savings - between $250 and $749, depending on where they live - are less likely to be evicted, miss housing or utility payments or receive government benefits after a health issue or job loss, according to a 2016 report by the Urban Institute. JPMorgan is initially giving seven grants worth between $300,000 and $1 million to nonprofits operating in Miami, London, San Diego and Boston, including some, like Mission Asset Fund, which the bank has worked with before. Briggs said the investments aim to help organizations build out technology or complete other steps needed to scale their services in their communities or nationwide. “The main theme is really understanding how do we actually improve people’s financial health - moving beyond knowing how to save more to actually saving more,” Briggs said. Mission Asset Fund provides no-interest loans to help immigrants and small business owners establish credit scores. Starting a few years ago, the bank’s corporate responsibility office provided financial assistance to help MAF expand to 60 cities, and will give it another $1 million as part of this initiative. Alice Rodriguez, head of community and business development for Chase, said working with nonprofits has contributed to the bank launching low-cost products like a no-overdraft-fee checking account called Chase Secure. But where those products cannot help low-income customers, the bank can refer them to these nonprofits. “To the extent that we can’t help a client with our own services, we are investing in these other nonprofits so that they can continue to provide that counseling at an ever greater scale,” Rodriguez said."
0.606748318544083," Long fight over error in JPMorgan loan to GM settles for $231 million WILMINGTON, Del (Reuters) - Lenders and hundreds of investors agreed on Monday to pay $231 million to end their decade-long legal fight over a clerical error in a $1.5 billion loan to General Motors that was administered by JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, according to court documents. The settlement payment will benefit the unsecured creditors of General Motors’ 2009 bankruptcy, as well as the U.S. and Canadian governments, which helped finance GM’s Chapter 11 case. The unsecured creditors, who collected pennies on the dollar from GM’s bankruptcy, have been trying for years to recoup some of the $1.5 billion that was paid to GM’s secured lenders. The $1.5 billion loan was syndicated to hundreds of investors who were defendants in the lawsuit. The individual settlement contributions by JPMorgan, a law firm that handled the paperwork and the investors in the loan were not disclosed in court documents. JPMorgan declined to comment. The dispute stemmed from the unintentional release of a lien on GM equipment due to a paperwork error. At the end of 2008, the automaker was preparing to pay off a $300 million financing. The law firm handling the paperwork accidentally included a lien that secured the $1.5 billion loan in the list of security interests it terminated after the $300 million was repaid. Releasing the lien rendered part of the loan unsecured, allowing a trustee working for unsecured creditors of GM to try to claw the money back. The mistake did not invalidate all liens securing the $1.5 billion loan, and the parties have spent years disputing whether GM assets such as robots and conveyor belts secured loan. GM’s predecessor filed for bankruptcy in 2009, beset by a deep U.S. recession, an enormous debtload, high labor costs and outdated car models."
-1.7513658198798892," JPMorgan shareholders advised to vote against executive compensation by ISS NEW YORK (Reuters) - Proxy advisory group ISS has advised JPMorgan Chase & Co shareholders to vote against the bank’s executive compensation at its upcoming annual shareholder meeting, according to a report the firm published this week that was seen by Reuters. This is the third time the group has advocated voting against JPMorgan’s executive compensation since the Dodd-Frank law mandated shareholders be given a say on pay in 2010. Each time, ISS has cited discretionary compensation as a concern. JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets, did not immediately provide comment on the ISS view. The bank’s board of directors recommended in its proxy filing that shareholders vote to approve executive compensation at its shareholder meeting next week in Chicago, based on the company’s strong business results, risk controls and conduct, customer and stakeholder focus, and leadership in 2018. The influential proxy advisory firm said that although JPMorgan’s compensation committee uses performance assessments to guide the amount of discretionary compensation awarded, certain “factors assessed were described only vaguely and appear subjective.” “Investors increasingly prefer an incentive program structure that constrains discretion in favor of emphasis on objective and transparent determinations that are more compatible with pay-for-performance,” ISS wrote. ISS said it was also concerned about the vesting of one part of the pay plans described as performance share units. ISS previously advised voting against executive pay in 2015 because it objected to a discretionary cash bonus, and in 2011 because it said the chief executive pay was “significantly above-median” and the discretionary components reduced the focus on performance. JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, who has led the bank since 2005, received a total of $31 million in compensation for the year 2018, $1.5 million more than in 2017. His compensation included an annual base salary of more than $1.5 million and performance-based incentives of $29.5 million. The shareholder vote on executive compensation next week is ultimately nonbinding. However, the bank’s board said in its 2019 proxy statement that it will consider the results of the vote when making future compensation arrangements. In Britain, Standard Chartered faced investor criticism at its annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday after roughly a third of votes were cast against its executive compensation plans. Standard Chartered’s pay plans differ significantly from U.S. banks. ISS and another advisory firm, Glass Lewis, had advised shareholders to vote against the plans."

-1.7513658198798892," JPMorgan poised to be first foreigner to get majority in China fund venture HONG KONG (Reuters) - JPMorgan could become the first foreign company to own a majority stake in its Chinese mutual fund business, after its joint venture partner put a crucial 2 percent of the business up for sale that analysts expect the Wall Street bank to lap up. A move by JPMorgan towards that goal would come at a tense time in U.S.-China ties, as Chinese Vice Premier Liu He is set to continue trade negotiations with the United States that were roiled after U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday he would raise tariffs. Under new rules announced in late 2017, foreign asset managers can own up to 51 percent of their Chinese mutual fund joint ventures, though, so far, no company has managed to do so. J.P. Morgan Asset Management (JPMAM) currently owns 49 percent of China International Fund Management (CIFM), while Shanghai International Trust, belonging to Shanghai Pudong Development Group, owns 51 percent. Shanghai International Trust said in a posting on the Shanghai United Assets and Equity Exchange website it is auctioning a 2 percent stake. “This is a very, very critical step because this potentially could open the doorway for a number of other deals to begin working their way through the process,” said Peter Alexander, founder and managing director of fund consultancy Z-Ben Advisors. Alexander added he had “a high conviction level” that JPMorgan will be the buyer and that the purchase price will be watched closely, as it will offer a guidance on the “premium” foreign firms need to pay for control of a Chinese fund venture. The open bidding process begins on May 8, and will continue until June 4. Last year, JPMorgan said that its asset management unit was “pursuing its desire and intent to increase its current joint venture stake in China International Fund Management Co Ltd to a majority interest.” A spokeswoman for JPMAM declined to comment on Shanghai International Trust’s move. Were JPMAM to win the auction, it would still need approval from Chinese regulators to reach 51 percent. Morgan Stanley became the largest shareholder last month in its joint venture, but remains short of majority control. A number of foreign asset managers, including JPMAM, wholly own companies in China which hold private securities fund management licenses. However, these licenses do not allow them to sell products to mass market retail investors, something that is allowed for mutual fund management joint ventures. Lack of access to the China market for foreign companies, including financial services firms, is one major area of contention in the trade dispute between China and the United States, and Z-Ben Advisors’ Alexander said that the stake auction by JPMorgan’s Chinese fund partner could be seen in the context of the trade talks. “You know this could have been done ages ago. Why now? I don’t believe in coincidence,” he said."

2.247581612475489," J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley see U.S. Fed may cut interest on reserves next week NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve may lower the interest it pays on excess reserves banks leave with it by 5 basis points at its April 30-May 1 policy meeting in a bid to prevent the federal funds rate from drifting higher, two primary dealers said on Friday. The fed funds rate has been running consistently above the interest on excess reserves (IOER) since mid-March, fanning worries excess bank reserves are scarce, which would drive up short-term borrowing costs broadly. On Thursday, the average or effective fed funds rate (EFFR) stood at 2.44%, 4 basis points above the current IOER level. “We believe the move higher in EFFR comes as a surprise to the Fed and most market participants since there has been a belief that at current reserve levels EFFR is likely to remain sticky close to IOER,” Morgan Stanley strategists Matthew Hornbach and Sam Elprince wrote in a research note. If the Fed reduces the IOER spread to the lower end of its target range on interest rates, it would mark the third such “technical” adjustment on the interest on excess reserves (IOER) following cuts last June and December. “If the funds rate continues to trade near recent levels, we think there’s about one-in-three chance they make another 5 (basis points) technical adjustment to the IOER rate,” J.P. Morgan economist Michael Feroli wrote in a note. J.P. Morgan and Morgan Stanley are among 23 Wall Street firms that do business directly with the Fed.

0.4348246150597781," JPMorgan shuffles CFO and card services executives NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co shuffled the jobs of two of its most senior women executives on Wednesday, moving Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake to a role leading consumer lending and naming the head of card services Jenn Piepszak to replace her. The moves, which take effect on May 1, were announced in an internal memo signed by Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon and the bank’s two co-presidents. During the 13 years that Dimon has run the bank, he has made it a practice to move even top executives into different roles to give them more experience across the banking franchise. The new role will give Lake, who has been indicated as a likely successor to Dimon, her first opportunity to run one of the bank’s business, a key qualification that was missing from her resume. Lake has won praise from investors and Wall Street analysts for handling the CFO job and Dimon’s demands. “No one likes change especially given how exceptional a CFO Marianne Lake has been,” wrote Susan Katzke, a bank analyst at Credit Suisse. “We are surprised but not shocked. Talent management comes with change.” Dimon, 63, has made something of a joke of perpetually saying he will resign in five years. Recently, he said he the five-year clock has actually begun. In her new role, Lake will oversee card services, home lending and auto finance. She has prior experience in that area, previously serving as CFO of consumer and community banking from 2009 to 2012. She took the job of CFO of the entire bank in January 2013. Piepszak’s star has been rising at JPMorgan as she moved through different businesses in JPMorgan’s consumer and community banking segment under co-president Gordon Smith. Previously, she served as CEO of the business banking unit, and prior to that she was CFO of mortgage banking. As CFO, Piepszak will have a seat on the bank’s powerful operating committee, giving her a front row view into all of the bank’s businesses. “Jenn has excelled in every role she has taken on in her 25 years with our firm,” the memo said. JPMorgan is the biggest U.S. bank by assets and is the most profitable among big banks as measured by return on tangible equity."

4.4117362359710866," JPMorgan lifts expectations for rivals with earnings beat NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co’s better-than-expected first-quarter earnings raised expectations that rival Wall Street lenders would follow suit when they report next week, pushing most bank stocks higher on Friday. Shares in JPMorgan jumped as much as 4.7 percent in morning trading, touching a more than four-month high before paring some gains. Morgan Stanley shares were up 3.8 percent and Bank of America Corp rose 2.8 percent. Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Citigroup shares both climbed 2 percent. JPMorgan is the largest U.S. bank by assets and a bellwether for the U.S economy and financial sector. It reported strong results across its businesses, with Chief Executive Jamie Dimon citing solid U.S. economic growth, moderate inflation and robust consumer and business confidence. Even a 10 percent fall in JPMorgan’s trading revenue from a year earlier was viewed as boding well for others, since analysts had been bracing for a bigger drop in fixed-income and equities trading. “JPMorgan had a positive read-across for trading results in the quarter,” said KBW analyst Brian Kleinhanzl. “We believe FICC (fixed income, commodities and currencies) trading should be a positive read-across to Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley.” Bank stock investors appeared to zero in on JPMorgan and ignore Wells Fargo & Co, the other big bank that reported on Friday. Wells Fargo reported higher first-quarter earnings but lowered its forecast for net interest income this year, a move that sent its shares tumbling as much as 3 percent. U.S. bank stocks had underperformed in recent months as economists and investors fixated on a flattening yield curve, normally the precursor to a recession. Bank executives have downplayed those concerns, pointing to continuing loan growth in the first quarter of 2019. Since the start of December, the S&P 500 financial sector is up 0.3 percent, while the overall S&P 500 is up 5 percent. The S&P 500 banks index fell 2.5 percent over the same period. Brushing aside global economic concerns such as Brexit and U.S.-China trade tensions, JPMorgan’s Dimon said the U.S. economy “continues to grow, employment and wages are going up, inflation is moderate, financial markets are healthy and consumer and business confidence remains strong.”"
4.4117362359710866," JPMorgan's solid quarterly profit beats back recession fears (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Friday, easing fears that slowing economic growth could weigh on its results. The largest U.S. bank by assets showed strength across its businesses in the first quarter, driven by what Chief Executive Jamie Dimon described as solid U.S. economic growth, moderate inflation and strong consumer and business confidence. U.S. bank stocks have underperformed the broader market in recent months on fears of an impending recession, with economists and investors citing concerns over a flattening yield curve and slowing housing market. But bank executives have downplayed concerns, pointing to continuing loan growth. “There is no law that says it has to stop,” Dimon said when asked if the decade-long economic expansion is due to turn into a recession. “I wouldn’t count on there having to be a recession in the short run.” Loans in JPMorgan’s consumer banking division rose 4 percent from a year ago. Overall revenue rose 4.7 percent to $29.85 billion. Analysts had expected revenue of $28.44 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. “We’ve been generally quite optimistic about the outlook for the economy,” Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake told reporters on a call to discuss the results. “It doesn’t diminish the fact that there are a number of risks out there. Right now we don’t see that playing out in the data.” The bank’s net interest margin, a key measure of loan profitability, edged up only 0.02 percent point from the fourth quarter, a slower pace of improvement than in the two previous quarters. Investors have been concerned that net interest margins may have peaked for the banks, since the Federal Reserve has signaled it is unlikely to raise short-term rates this year and the spread between short- and longer-term rates has narrowed. While Lake did not directly answer if the lending spread had peaked after fueling profit growth for years, she said it will likely not get any better in the coming quarters. The bank expects it to remain constant, she said. Unlike Wells Fargo & Co, the other big U.S. bank to report earnings on Friday, JPMorgan stood by its outlook for net interest income, a key driver of profits, which it expects to increase about 4 percent this year over 2018. Wells said it now expects its NII to decline 2 to 5 percent instead of landing in a range of plus or minus 2 percent. The change sent Wells shares down as much 2.4 percent. Lake also reiterated the bank’s 17 percent projection for return on average tangible common equity and said she does not anticipate the bank will raise it this year. Lake downplayed questions about whether the bank’s $90 million provision for credit losses in its commercial banking segment in the first quarter was a reason for concern. “These downgrades were idiosyncratic. It was a handful of names” of diverse commercial and industrial borrowers, she said. “We are not seeing signs of deterioration.” In the bank’s capital markets business, equity underwriting fell 13 percent and bond trading revenues fell 8 percent from the year-ago quarter. Bank executives had signaled earlier in the quarter that capital markets revenue could fall by a greater amount. Shares of the bank were up 3.6 percent in morning trading. The bank said net income rose to a record $9.18 billion, or $2.65 per share, in the quarter ended March 31, from $8.71 billion, or $2.37 per share, a year earlier. Net interest income rose 8 percent to $14.60 billion, boosted by interest rate increases since the first quarter of last year. Analysts had estimated earnings of $2.35 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv."

4.4117362359710866," REFILE-UPDATE 2-JPMorgan profit beat eases fear of slowing economy (Corrects quarter in second paragraph) April 12 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Friday, easing fears that slowing economic growth could weigh on its results. The largest U.S. bank by assets showed strength across its businesses in the first quarter, driven by what Chief Executive Jamie Dimon described as solid growth in the U.S. economy, moderate inflation and strong consumer and business confidence. Loans in the consumer banking division rose 4 percent from a year ago. Overall revenue rose 4.7 percent to $29.85 billion. The bank’s net interest margin, a key measure of loan profitability, edged up only 0.02 percent point from the fourth quarter, a slower pace of improvement than in the two previous quarters. Investors have been concerned that net interest margins may have peaked for the banks, since the Federal Reserve has signaled it is unlikely to raise short-term rates this year and the spread between short- and longer-term rates has narrowed. Investors will be listening closely to what bank executives say about changes in their outlooks for interest margins in coming quarters, analyst Brian Kleinhanzl of Keefe, Bruyette & Woods wrote in a note ahead of the results. There are other warning signs. JPMorgan’s commercial banking segment made a $90 million provision for credit losses in the first quarter primarily because of downgrades in the credit worthiness of what it called “select” commercial and industrial borrowers. In the bank’s capital markets business, equity underwriting fell 13 percent and bond trading revenues fell 8 percent from the year ago quarter. Bank executives had signaled earlier in the quarter that capital markets revenue could fall by a greater amount. Shares of the bank were up 2.3 percent in early trading. Analysts had expected revenue of $28.44 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. JPMorgan’s results kick off earnings for the big banks and are closely watched by investors for cues on the health of the U.S. economy and the financial system. The bank said net income rose to a record $9.18 billion, or $2.65 per share, in the quarter ended March 31, from $8.71 billion, or $2.37 per share, a year earlier. Net interest income rose 8 percent to $14.60 billion, boosted by interest rate increases since the first quarter of last year. Analysts had estimated earnings of $2.35 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. (Additional reporting by David Henry and Matt Scuffham; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila and Neal Templin.)"

The S&P 500 e-minis were up 17.25 points, or 0.6% by 8:42 a.m. ET. If the gains hold at the open, the benchmark would top 2,900 points for the first time since Oct. 5. JPMorgan Chase & Co rose 2.8% after the largest U.S. bank by assets beat quarterly profit estimates, easing fears that slowing economic growth could weigh on its results. Shares of Well Fargo & Co climbed 0.5% after reporting a 16.4 percent increase in quarterly profit. “The market has been stagnated for a while and when you get a good report like JPM then that’s going to help sentiment and will probably be the main focus for the next three weeks,” said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist and senior portfolio manager at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York. Another big gainer premarket was Walt Disney Co, whose shares rose 6.3% after the company priced it highly anticipated streaming service in a bid to challenge the digital dominance of Netflix Inc. Netflix shares were down 1.5%. S&P 500 companies are expected to post their first profit contraction since 2016 in the first quarter, with analysts projecting a 2.5 percent drop in earnings. Bank earnings are also expected to see a steep drop. S&P 500 banks are expected to post earnings growth of 1.8%, down from an 8.2% rise estimated six months ago, according to Refinitiv data. The S&P banks index has risen 12.8% this year, compared with a 15.2% gain for the S&P 500. Data from China showed exports rebounded in March but imports shrank for a fourth straight month and at a sharper pace. The data, which eased concerns about a slowdown in world’s second largest economy, as well as a jump in oil prices offered support to global equities. Grabbing the spotlight in the energy sector was Chevron Corp’s $33 billion offer to buy smaller rival Anadarko Petroleum Corp. Shares of Anadarko jumped 31.6%, while Chevron fell 4.6%. Shares of Anadarko’s peers were also up on the news. Devon Energy Corp and EOG Resources Inc gained 4.4% each, while Marathon Oil Corp was up 3.1%. Dow e-minis were up 227 points, or 0.87% and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 36.5 points, or 0.48%. The S&P 500 index is now less than 2% away from its all-time high hit in September and investors are hoping that a trade deal with China and a better-than-feared quarterly earnings season will help push Wall Street above record.

4.4117362359710866," Venezuela debt placed on 'index watch' by JPMorgan (Reuters) - Venezuela’s debt is another step closer to being removed from a key emerging market bond index series after JPMorgan Chase & Co placed the country’s securities on “index watch” because of trading disruptions caused by U.S. sanctions against President Nicolas Maduro’s government. In an advisory to JPMorgan index clients seen by Reuters, the bank said the “index watch” designation covered both Venezuelan sovereign bonds and those issued by state-run oil company PDVSA in its widely followed EMBIG Diversified, EMBIG and EMBI+ indexes. During the review period, JPMorgan will evaluate liquidity and transactional viability, while watching for official communications around secondary market trading in Venezuela debt. When the period ends on June 28, “a more definitive course of action for Venezuela in the index will be determined,” the bank said. “It’s a classic case of a potential bonanza for active managers like us and a terrible disaster for passive managers,” said Jan Dehn, head of research at Ashmore Group, a specialist emerging markets investment manager. “If JPMorgan’s final decision is to exclude these bonds from their index those passive investors (who track it) will be forced to sell at exactly the wrong time as the direction of travel in Venezuela is quite clear. Once the regime change happens, which is inevitable, you’re going to want to hold these securities as they’re going to double in value.” The sanctions imposed by the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) have impaired secondary market trading, liquidity and price discovery on Venezuela’s sovereign bonds and on PDVSA’s securities, the notice said. In January, U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration imposed sweeping sanctions on PDVSA intended to prevent Maduro’s government from siphoning funds from the oil company to maintain his grip on power. Washington has also put curbs on trading in the country’s sovereign debt. JPMorgan said 76% of investors responding to a recent index client survey said their approved counterparties did not offer them the ability to unwind their PDVSA or sovereign bond holdings. “These conditions constitute a de-facto market disruption event from the index standpoint,” it said. Unless market conditions improve by the end of the review period, JPMorgan may begin a reduction of the index’s exposure to Venezuelan bonds. “A prolonged market disruption may result in the reduction of Venezuela’s index weight to zero in a phased manner,” the advisory said. Any such phase-out could take three to five months, with the process likely ending in late November. But additional restrictions on secondary market activity could trigger an accelerated wind-down. The status of Venezuelan debt in the JPMorgan indexes has been a central concern for investors since the sanctions were imposed earlier this year. Currently, 20 bonds from Venezuela - 12 sovereign issues and eight from PDVSA - are in the benchmark EMBIG Diversified index with a total weight of 0.97%. That is down from 1.19% in early February. Under Maduro’s government, the oil-rich nation has defaulted on most of its $63 billion of debt as it has spiraled into its worst-ever economic crisis, with rampant hyperinflation and a food shortage. The Venezuelan securities rallied earlier this year after the United States and other major Western powers recognized opposition leader Juan Guaido as the country’s legitimate leader. The OFAC sanctions, however, have effectively brought activity in its bonds to a halt."

8.530488208478577," Big banks to report first quarter results with lowered expectations NEW YORK (Reuters) - Investors will focus on falling profits, a more dovish Federal Reserve and lower interest rates as major U.S. banks kick off what analysts expect to be the first quarter of contracting corporate earnings since 2016. On Friday, April 12, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Wells Fargo & Co will post results to begin the earnings season in earnest. Citigroup Inc and Goldman Sachs Group Inc will report the following Monday, followed by Bank of America Corp and Morgan Stanley on Tuesday. In the wake of the Federal Reserve’s cautious shift due to signs of softness in the U.S. economy and the subsequent drop in 10-year Treasury yields, S&P 500 banks are seen posting year-on-year first-quarter earnings growth of 2.3%, down from 8.2% forecast six months ago, according to Refinitiv data. (For an interactive graphic on evolving bank earnings estimates click, tmsnrt.rs/2HOVt1D) “The Fed pivoted so abruptly, which gives one pause about what they’re saying about the economy,” said Chuck Carlson, chief executive officer at Horizon Investment Services in Hammond, Indiana. “Flat to falling interest rates are not good news for bank interest margins. It’s not surprising that analysts are taking down earnings estimates.” The central bank’s change in tack put the brakes on what had been a pattern of quarterly rate hikes, amid signs of slowing economic growth. Slowdown jitters have also hit 10-year Treasury yields. The benchmark bond’s yield hit a 15-month low in the first quarter, flattening the yield curve and narrowing the gap between the interest banks pay depositors and the interest they charge consumers, which is bad news for profits. “That’s why the estimates are going down,” Carlson added. “(Analysts are) fearful of interest margins for banks and there’s an underlying concern about loan growth.” In the first three months of the year, the S&P 500 bounced back from a sell-off in December, gaining 13.1%, its biggest quarterly increase since 2009. But financials underperformed the wider market, gaining 7.9% in the quarter as the new low-interest-rate normal that boosted other sectors was a headwind for banks. Since October, analysts have drastically lowered their expectations for S&P 500 earnings in 2019, with first-quarter estimates dropping from 8.1% growth to a year-over-year decline of 2.2%. That would mark the first quarter of negative growth since the earnings “recession” that ended in 2016. The partial federal government shutdown in January and an expected drop in trading revenues provided additional impetus for analysts to cut first-quarter bank earnings estimates. In a KBW note dated April 3, lead analyst Brian Kleinhanzl sees median year-on-year revenues from both equities and fixed income, currencies and commodities (FICC) trading to have dropped by 15% in the quarter. “Within financials, the industry that’s been hit hardest is capital markets,” said Tajinder Dhillon, senior research analyst at Refinitiv on London. “Those downward revisions have intensified over the last 90 days. Of the big 6 banks, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and JPMorgan have seen the biggest declines” in first-quarter earnings estimates. But some analysts believe the effects on banks of a more accommodative Fed and the flattened yield curve are overstated. Oppenheimer lead analyst Chris Kotowski wrote in a March 25 note “to be sure, rates and the yield curve have had an effect on bank earnings.” But he called the impact from the Fed’s decision “a minor one,” and wrote that aside from these impacts, “bank fundamentals are remarkably stable.” Recent history shows that large U.S. financial institutions have beat analyst estimates at a higher rate than the broader market. In the eight most recent quarters, the six banks have beat earnings estimates 83.3% of the time on average, compared with the S&P 500’s 75.4% average beat rate. Additionally, bank revenues surprised to the upside 79.2% of the time, while S&P 500 company revenues came in ahead of analyst estimates 68.3% of the time, per Refinitiv data. (For a graphic on 'U.S. banks beat/miss track record' click, tmsnrt.rs/2Vmv2DP) In today’s late-cycle reality, however, it is not clear that banks can beat even lowered expectations. Either way they should set the tone for what analysts predict will be a rocky earnings period. “Psychologically, these are bellwether companies that tend to drive sentiment,” Dhillon added, suggesting that their quarterly reports are proxy indicators of corporate earnings health. “Banks are up there.”"

The source also said the two funds, which together hold more than 6.7 percent of Knowles and are seeking to nominate two new members to its board, are still prepared to work cooperatively with the company on solutions. Shares in Knowles have risen about 3 percent since Caligan and Falcon went public with their demands at the end of last week, after settlement talks between the shareholders and the company stalled. JPMorgan’s involvement in the conflict was first reported earlier on Thursday by Dealreporter. The source said the funds were unwilling to agree to demands by Knowles that the funds enter a two-year stand-still agreement in return for a single board seat. After an overwhelming vote in favor of de-staggering the company’s board at its last annual meeting, six of Knowles’ board members will be up for re-election at a 2020 shareholders’ meeting. A two-year standstill agreement would require the activists to vote in favor of all board proposals till 2021. While Caligan and Falcon were open to settling for one seat instead of two, the stand-still demand, described as ""off-market"" in the funds' letter here dated March 29, was a dealbreaker, the source said. Caligan and Falcon Edge also posted a presentation (bit.ly/2YNXqka) on Wednesday, demanding the company release detailed financials for its struggling Intelligent Audio segment. The funds said they believe Knowles’ stock could reach at least $28 per share in value by the end of the year if the company listened to their feedback.

11.286653748087142," JP Morgan, Nomura get nod for China brokerage JVs as market access expands SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - JP Morgan and Nomura have won Chinese regulatory approval to set up majority-owned brokerage joint ventures, in China’s latest move to open its financial sector up to foreign firms. The China Securities Regulatory Commission said on Friday it will continue to approve foreign brokerage joint ventures “efficiently”, after announcing its decision for the two banks. Allowing foreign banks a controlling stake in securities joint ventures is a key part of China’s pledge to ease ownership curbs, especially in the trillion-dollar financial sector. A lack of control and limited contribution to revenue have long been a source of frustration for western investment banks, and a reason behind JP Morgan’s 2016 decision to sell its 33 percent ownership in its then Chinese joint venture. Western banks including Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse run joint ventures, whose offerings include debt and equity underwriting and financial advisory, with varying degrees of operational control. Beijing gave UBS approval in November to hold a majority stake in its securities joint venture, making it the first foreign bank to do so under new rules announced in 2017. JP Morgan and Nomura applied to set up majority-controlled joint ventures in China last year. But unlike UBS, neither has a mainland joint venture and would need to start from scratch. The majority-owned securities venture will allow JP Morgan to further strengthen its China business and offer “a complete set of services and solutions” to its clients, the Wall Street bank said in a statement. “It’s a critical component of our growth plans globally as well as in Asia Pacific,” JP Morgan Asia Pacific Chairman and Chief Executive Nicolas Aguzin, said. Nomura said it’s China joint venture would initially focus on the wealth management business, and expand its offerings “with the ultimate goal of growing the business into a full-fledged brokerage”. “With an increased presence in China, we aim to support economic growth in both China and Japan and firmly establish ourselves as a global financial services group with deep roots in Asia,” Nomura Chief Executive Koji Nagai said. The recent approvals for greater access to foreigners, from insurance to asset management, comes amid a festering trade war with the United States, with increased access to the financial sector among a host of demands from Washington. Premier Li Keqiang said on Thursday that Beijing will expand market access for foreign banks and securities and insurance companies, especially in financial services. China has in recent years allowed many foreign financial firms to either set up new businesses onshore or expand their presence through majority ownership in joint ventures. Besides UBS, HSBC also holds 51 percent of its securities business in China, which was launched in 2017, but the Asia-focused bank does so under rules allowing Hong Kong-based companies special access."

9.75898163043691," JPMorgan awards research grants, deepening its AI push NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co has awarded 47 financial grants to university faculty and PhD students for artificial intelligence research, ramping up its efforts in the emerging technology, the bank plans to announce later on Monday. Winners of the JPMorgan’s first AI Research Awards will study the use of AI and machine learning in areas including investment advice, risk management, digital assistants and trading behavior. The bank declined to disclose the size of the grants. JPMorgan and other financial institutions have been investing more to develop artificial intelligence-based technology to better process the vast amounts of data they collect and produce, and to become more efficient. But they are struggling to compete for the best computer-science talent with Silicon Valley startups and large technology companies such as Alphabet Inc’s and Amazon.com Inc. Through the awards, the bank hopes to deepen ties with academia following the creation of its AI research division less than a year ago, Manuela Veloso, head of JPMorgan’s AI Research, said in an interview. Veloso’s 16-member unit helps the bank come up with ways for AI to improve its internal processes, by automating more mundane tasks, and enhance services to clients. The bank spends around $11.5 billion a year on technology and employs more than 50,000 workers in IT. “The world is becoming increasingly digital and there is a lot of data,” Veloso said. “The only way for this data to be truly useful is to have an AI solution to process it.” The division’s areas of research include data and cryptography and ethics and fairness. While the grants do not require PhD fellows to join JPMorgan upon completing their studies, the hope is the awards can help attract talent. “We want AI and other technical students, when they finish, to also consider joining JPMorgan instead of only thinking about the tech companies,” said Veloso, who is on leave from Carnegie Mellon University."

9.754863708840169," Turkish watchdogs to probe JP Morgan after lira plunge ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey’s banking watchdog said it had launched an investigation into JP Morgan and other banks over complaints it received after the lira plunged more than 4 percent and the main share index fell sharply on Friday. The BDDK watchdog said on Saturday it received complaints that a report JP Morgan published on Friday hurt the reputation of Turkish banks and caused volatility in financial markets. The necessary “administrative and judicial processes” would be followed, it said. The Capital Markets Board of Turkey (SPK) also said it had launched a probe after receiving complaints that a JP Morgan report was “misleading” and caused speculation on the Istanbul bourse. A JP Morgan spokesman for the region declined to comment. The Turkish lira tumbled more than 4 per cent against the U.S. dollar on Friday, its biggest one-day fall since a currency crisis took hold in August, raising concerns that Turks are buying more foreign cash as ties with Washington deteriorate. The regulators’ actions are the latest official measures to counter the lira’s sharp decline. The central bank said on Friday it was suspending one-week repo auctions “for a period of time”, a policy tightening move to squeeze market liquidity and support the lira. A copy of the JP Morgan report seen by Reuters said it saw a high risk that the lira would decline after local elections set for 31 March, recommending clients to go ‘long’ on the U.S. dollar. Such advice is typical of client notes from banks globally. BDDK also said it was looking into claims that “some banks” had lead clients to buy foreign currencies in a manipulative and misleading way, and that the necessary administrative and judicial processes would be followed. The watchdog did not say which those banks were, or if they were Turkish or foreign. The total forex deposits and funds including precious metals of Turkish individuals hit a record high of $105.74 billion in the week to March 15, data from the central bank showed on Thursday. Turkey’s main index BIST100 was down 3.45 percent at Friday’s close, while the banking index had declined 6.64 percent."

10.54270812613882," JPMorgan Chase tests neuroscience-based video games to recruit interns NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co is testing neuroscience-based video games to help recruit interns, as it seeks to increase the diversity of its workforce by broadening its candidate pool. The bank is piloting technology from pymetrics, a startup whose games help companies assess applicants’ social, cognitive and behavioral features, such as attention, memory and altruism, Matt Mitro, JPMorgan’s head of campus recruiting, said in an interview. To identify which potential interns might be best suited for a job, the platform measures a candidate’s attributes against those of a firm’s successful employees. This helps companies make their assessments more data-based than traditional processes. Over the past few months, entry level employees at JPMorgan across the world played the pymetrics’ games, which were then played by hundreds of candidates for a limited number of full-time roles, Mitro said. Mitro said employment history is a good indicator of fit for experienced workers, but with recent college graduates, resumes have less predictive value. That prompted JPMorgan to test pymetrics’ technology with entry-level candidates, who are usually just starting their careers. Large firms have been increasingly turning to technology to make recruitment and other human resources processes more fair. Systems also include applications that scan performance reviews for unconscious bias or that monitor job ads for phrases that might dissuade a certain demographic from applying. “Our re-imagining of how we hire is part of a broader objective at the firm where we are asking ourselves: ‘Can we better meet our diversity goals by broadening the pool of candidates we are considering?’,” Mitro said. JPMorgan’s pilot will continue with applicants for 2020 internships in the United States, he added, noting that this technology would only be one step of the selection process. Pymetric’s clients also include Unilever Plc and Accenture Plc, according to its website"

JPMorgan, Bank of America Corp, and Wells Fargo & Co are nip and tuck in deposits. Bank of America, in early 2018, had decided to open more than 500 new branches across the United States by 2021. Chase said it will also hire up to 700 employees in the markets, which include Charlotte, North Carolina; Minneapolis, Minnesota; and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, from this summer. The company will also open some of these branches in the cities of Philadelphia, Boston and the Greater Washington area in the District of Columbia - markets it recently entered into. JPMorgan had said last year that it was planning to open 400 new branches, of which 30 percent would cater to low-to-moderate income communities, and hire as many as 3,000 employees in new markets over the next five years. In its latest quarterly report, JPMorgan showed that consumer and community banking deposits grew 3 percent to $673.78 billion. JPM’s Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said last month that she expects growth in deposits to slow and the interest it pays for them to rise, reducing profit margins on its loans.

2.241488901470874," JPMorgan keeps Venezuela in emerging bond indexes: fund managers SYDNEY/LONDON (Reuters) - JPMorgan has retained dollar-denominated debt issued by Venezuela and its state-run oil company PDVSA in a key emerging market bond index as part of its monthly rebalancing, according to two fund managers. Investors have been concerned about the status of debt issued by Venezuela and its oil firm after Washington imposed sweeping sanctions earlier this year. With the curbs, trade in Venezuelan debt has ground to a halt, leaving some investors concerned the price is not reflective of the assets’ true value and making it harder for passive funds to accurately reflect the indexes. JPMorgan, which declined to comment on its monthly rebalancing, had sent out a survey to its clients ahead of the rebalancing asking more specific questions about Venezuela, Tina Vandersteel, Boston-based head of emerging country debt at Grantham Mayo Van Otterloo & Co, told Reuters. “JPM had launched a survey, which I’d completed, about what to do about VENZ. The feedback I gave them was, per their index liquidity rules, while the sanctions prevailed, they should be removed,” Vandersteel said in an email. Investment managers’ willingness to support the eviction of Venezuelan debt from the indexes is also influenced by the flexibility of their funds’ investment mandates. A leading exchange-traded fund from BlackRock, the iShares JPMorgan USD Emerging Markets Bond ETF, for example, is allowed to invest up to 20 percent of its assets in securities not in the index, its prospectus showed. Yet making changes to portfolios in reality is not easy. “To actually exit the exposure is nearly impossible - especially for larger funds - as there is no trading,” said Uday Patnaik, Head of Emerging Market Debt at Legal & General Investment Management. “Placing the country weight to 0 percent while freezing the price of the securities makes the most sense,” he added. At the end of January, PDVSA had a weight of 0.53 in JPMorgan’s EMBI Global Diversified index while Venezuela Republic bonds were at 0.66, according to the index provider. Reuters did not have access to February index weight data. Venezuela - the country with the largest oil reserves in the world - has defaulted on most of its $63 billion of debt as it has spiraled into its worst-ever economic crisis. The International Monetary Fund has forecast inflation will hit 10 million percent this year. Since the start of the year, bonds issued by Venezuela and PDVSA chalked up steady gains amid weeks of protests that saw pressure mount on President Nicolas Maduro. However, trading in bonds ground to a halt after Washington imposed a swathe of sanctions, including a ban on U.S. investors from trading in the secondary market, other than divestment. JPMorgan communicates any changes of index constituents to its clients on the last trading day of the month.

4.781900664458459," JPMorgan plans temporary Paris hub for 200 staff if no-deal Brexit LONDON/PARIS (Reuters) - JPMorgan has secured additional office space on the outskirts of Paris to house up to 200 staff who could be billeted to the French capital at short notice, under plans to cope with the fallout from a ‘no deal’ Brexit, sources told Reuters. The U.S. investment bank has expanded an existing lease at the temporary base so it can accommodate a swift transfer of crucial operations to the city by April 1 if Britain were to leave the EU without a deal on March 29, the sources familiar with the matter said. The premises just outside central Paris would accommodate a mix of front, middle and back office employees that the bank considers to be vital to keeping its continental European business running smoothly. Staff earmarked to work out of the venue would do so on a temporary basis while the bank finalises longer term arrangements. JPMorgan has also taken short-term leases on an undisclosed number of hotel rooms and apartments in Paris and several other European cities where staff may also be moved to if there was a disorderly ‘no deal’ Brexit, one of the sources said. JPMorgan declined to comment. Britain is due to leave the EU in 29 days time, but has yet to agree an exit deal. The chances of a no-deal Brexit at the end of March have fallen after Prime Minister Theresa May said she would allow lawmakers to vote on whether to accept her proposed deal or else have a small extension to the leave date. Speaking at the Economic Club of New York in January, JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said the bank had spent hundreds of millions of dollars preparing for Brexit and was ready for all eventualities. If there is a no deal staff will remain in place at the temporary site in Paris until the Wall Street heavyweight progresses plans to secure additional prime real estate in the city, preferably close to its existing offices in the city’s famous Place Vendome. JPMorgan has been resident in Place Vendome since 1916 but there is not enough space to accommodate its ‘Day 1’ Brexit team there, and not enough time to fit out other more permanent addresses under consideration, including Hotel de la Marine on Place de la Concorde, the sources said. With one of the most competitive and expensive prime office markets in Europe, JPMorgan is unwilling to rush into signing a long-term lease on a large new base in Paris, especially if a lengthy Brexit transition deal is confirmed. During a transition, European regulators are expected to give greater clarity on the scale and scope of operations international banks will be required to have in the EU compared with their existing European headquarters in London."

For two years, JPMorgan’s commercial banking business has been building a list of around 1,500 middle-market European companies that it wants to attract through its global approach to investment banking, credit, hedging and treasury services. The targets are companies with between $500 million to $2 billion in annual revenue and international ambitions, including known brands that already use JPMorgan for their U.S. business and companies whose owners are JPMorgan private wealth clients. “We see a lot of opportunity for local corporations in these markets to grow, and they can benefit from working with a global banking partner,” Rob Holmes, head of the bank’s corporate client banking & specialized industries (CCBSI) group, said in a statement.

3.8563856793485374," JPMorgan absolved by U.S. judge in former top broker's suicide NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge in Manhattan on Tuesday dismissed a wrongful death lawsuit against JPMorgan Chase & Co by the estate of a former top broker, who it said committed suicide after being forced into retirement. U.S. District Judge John Keenan said it was not reasonably foreseeable that JPMorgan’s treatment of Michael Lorig would cause him to take his life at age 66 on Jan. 22, 2017, after years of what the estate called depression and mental illness. Keith Fleischman, a lawyer for the estate, declined to comment. JPMorgan also declined to comment. According to the complaint, Lorig was a senior managing director from Florida who joined JPMorgan after it bought his former employer Bear Stearns in 2008. The marathoner and avid cyclist performed in the top 20 percent of his division and commanded seven-figure pay, but was told on Aug. 8, 2016, there was “no work for him to return to” after he spent two years on disability leave, the complaint said. Lorig had twice previously taken leaves of absence for his depression, and his mental health issues were or should have been known to the bank, the complaint added. Keenan, said, however, that because Lorig had assumed he could return to work after his disability leave, only actions taken by JPMorgan after he was told he could not return could be said to have caused his suicide. The judge also said it had been nearly two years since Lorig’s doctors advised JPMorgan that Lorig might be suicidal. “Given these circumstances, it was not reasonably foreseeable that defendants’ actions would result in Lorig’s suicide,” Keenan wrote. “These actions were simply too attenuated to be the proximate cause.” The estate had sought a variety of monetary damages. The case is Mullaugh as personal representative of the Estate of Lorig v JPMorgan Chase & Co et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 18-02908."
3.8563856793485374," JPMorgan keeps key profit goal, cautious on U.S. recession risks NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, said on Tuesday it expects to face rising costs for deposits, a key part of its business, and slowing global economic growth. Still, senior executives, speaking at the bank’s annual investor day, painted a picture of stable financial performance and maintained a key profit goal for the next three years. Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said while JPMorgan is strong in many of its businesses, the bank was uncertain whether the near-term future for interest rates and the U.S. economy would provide the underlying strength that could boost its bankwide profit targets. JPMorgan’s annual investor day is closely watched by investors as the bank accounts for about 14 percent of U.S. banking industry revenue, according to estimates by analysts at Barclays. Lake said the bank expects growth in deposits to slow and the interest it pays for them to rise, reducing profit margins on its loans. At the same time, new regulations are making those loans less profitable and pushing the bank to invest more in securities. “The further out you go, the less confidence we have that we won’t see” changes in interest rates and a downturn in the economy, Lake said, when asked why the bank did not raise its target for profitability. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said the bank’s decision not to raise its profitability target was not a warning about the economy. “We are not predicting a recession. We are prepared for a recession,” Dimon said. Like last year, the bank said it expects its return on tangible common equity, a key profit measure for how well it uses shareholder money, to be 17 percent over the medium term, which the bank considers roughly three years. The bank may exceed its key growth targets, Lake said, but its forecast is set with a cautious view of future risks, including global trade worries as well as Britain’s pending withdrawal from the European Union, or Brexit, she said. “Recent declines in business sentiment have driven recessionary risk higher,” she said, referring to the United States. Still, she added, “the U.S. economy remains consumer-led, and consumers are strong and healthy.” JPMorgan faces a balancing act: reassuring investors while not making pledges that are likely to haunt it in the future amid growing economic turbulence. In the fourth quarter, JPMorgan and several other big banks took a hit in their fixed-income trading operations as a market swoon kept clients on the sidelines. Trading revenue in the first quarter is expected to be down in the “high teens” in percentage terms after an unusually strong quarter a year earlier when the U.S. tax overhaul boosted results, said Daniel Pinto, head of JPMorgan’s corporate and investment bank. In a recession, Dimon said, the bank would continue to invest in its businesses. “We would take advantage of a recession to build our branches, network, etcetera. We would take advantage of a recession.” While executives trumpeted market share gains from recently increased spending on technology and marketing, they also acknowledged problems. “It is a tough time to be in the mortgage business,” said Gordon Smith, chief executive officer of consumer and community banking. Mike Weinbach, head of home lending, said mortgage originations will likely remain “near cyclical lows” in the coming years. The industry is struggling with excess capacity for making loans, even as the cost of new loans continues to rise, he said. The bank sketched out its views before the stock market opened in a slide presentation ahead of the investor day. (bit.ly/2GMaYXR) JPMorgan shares fell 1.2 percent at $104.84 after dropping as much as 2 percent early in the session. The bank stuck with its previous targets of an expense overhead ratio of 55 percent as adjusted expenses were set to rise this year by $2.3 billion, or 3.6 percent. The higher expense forecast includes $600 million of new technology investments and $1.6 billion for marketing, front-office hiring, new branches and a new headquarters building. The additional spending is down from $2.7 billion a year ago, when it boosted the technology budget by $1.4 billion."

6.350452771906341," JPMorgan trades banker offices for shared desks NEW YORK - JPMorgan Chase & Co is tearing down walls and moving its San Francisco investment bankers onto “hot desks,” a space-saving layout that has long been a fixture at tech companies, while redesigning offices in Dallas and other cities. Shared workspaces have been relatively slow to catch on at banks, but JPMorgan is following recent renovations by some rivals, which designers tout as cost cutting and productivity boosting. Still, bankers who covet the status and privacy of personal offices are in for big changes. When JPMorgan renovated two floors at its Mission Street office in San Francisco last month, it replaced many offices with diner-style booths, designated quiet zones and communal tables for the roughly 250 investment bankers and other employees there. Noah Wintroub, a San Francisco-based vice chairman of investment banking at JPMorgan who focuses on tech and media companies, said he lobbied for the open-desk layout, though it may be a culture shock for some. “We have historically been very hierarchical. When you become a managing director you have this kind of office,” Wintroub said. The bank already set up hot desking for investment bankers in Hong Kong, said David Arena, JPMorgan’s head of global corporate real estate. It was able to cut costs by putting more people on fewer floors. Arena did not say if U.S. renovations will help JPMorgan shrink its real estate footprint. He noted limits to the approach, saying it is “counter-productive if too many people are squeezed into one space.” JPMorgan is also redesigning offices in Phoenix and Columbus, Ohio. It did not say if there were any plans to include hot desks at the bank’s New York main office, which is currently under construction. Goldman Sachs Group Inc tore down walls in its New York asset management office in 2017, and Morgan Stanley, is redesigning its midtown Manhattan headquarters to move brokers, traders and tech employees closer together, according to media reports. Multiple users sharing one workstation has been common at tech and consulting companies for more than a decade, and a 2015 study by industry group the International Facility Management Association found a majority of businesses now use hot desking for at least some staff. But the layout was slower to take hold in banking, where a cultural resistance stems in part from the need to take confidential calls in private, according to the report. Offices were also status symbols, and sitting at a communal table instead of one’s own glass office is a big shift for investment bankers. Some will still have offices, including Wintroub, though he said he prefers to sit with others in the open area and use his office as a conference room."
6.350452771906341," Fed permanently bars former JPMorgan banker over China hiring scandal WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Reserve said on Thursday it was barring former JPMorgan Chase & Co Managing Director Timothy Fletcher from the industry for life over his role in a China hiring program for which the bank was fined $264 million in 2016. The Fed alleged that Fletcher had “improperly administered” the program to hire relatives of Chinese officials “in order to obtain improper business advantages for the firm.” The Fed said Fletcher consented to the prohibition. Fletcher, who had worked at JPMorgan’s Hong Kong unit, could not could immediately be reached for comment. In 2016 the bank agreed to pay a total of $264 million to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the Justice Department and the Fed, to resolve the allegations its hiring program had violated the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The Fed said on Thursday Fletcher had “engaged in unsafe and unsound practices, breaches of fiduciary duty, and violations of law.” The regulator said it was also requiring Fletcher to cooperate in any pending or potential enforcement action against other individuals who are or were affiliated with the firm."
4.917986815337856," Wall Street divided on Brexit: Goldman sees a deal, JPMorgan sees a delay * Goldman: 15 percent probability of no deal Brexit * JPMorgan: May will delay Brexit * Senior banker: Risks of no deal rising * Berenberg: 10 percent chance of May’s deal (Adds details and JPMorgan) By Guy Faulconbridge, Helen Reid and Andrew MacAskill LONDON, Feb 15 (Reuters) - As the United Kingdom’s Brexit crisis deepens, two of the titans of Wall Street have starkly different views of the ultimate outcome: Goldman Sachs sees a 50 percent probability of a ratified deal while JPMorgan sees a delay. Unless Prime Minister Theresa May can get a Brexit deal approved by the British parliament, then she will have to decide whether to delay Brexit or thrust the world’s fifth largest economy into chaos by leaving without a deal. Goldman Sachs said it sees a 50 percent probability of May getting a Brexit divorce deal ratified, adding that lawmakers would ultimately block a no-deal exit if needed. Goldman said it saw the probability of a no-deal exit at 15 percent and the probability of no Brexit at around 35 percent. “There does exist a majority in the House of Commons willing to avoid a ‘no deal’ Brexit (if called upon to do so), but there does not yet exist a majority in the House of Commons willing to support a second referendum (at least at this stage),” Goldman said in a note to clients on Friday. “The prime minister will repeatedly try to defer the definitive parliamentary vote on her negotiated Brexit deal, and the intensification of tail risks will continue to play a role in incentivising the eventual ratification of that deal.” May suffered a defeat on her Brexit strategy on Thursday that undermined her pledge to EU leaders to get her divorce deal approved if they grant her concessions. She has promised that if parliament has not approved a deal by Feb. 26, she will make a statement updating lawmakers on her progress on that day and lawmakers will have an opportunity on Feb. 27 to debate and vote on the way forward. JPMorgan said that it thought May would now seek an extension to the March 29 deadline. The divergent views from two of the most powerful Wall Street banks indicates just how hard investors are finding it to read the labyrinthine plots and counterplots of Brexit, the United Kingdom’s most significant political and economic move since World War Two. “Having chosen to afford the PM extra time this week, our expectation is that a majority of MPs will finally be prepared to begin to take action to attempt to ensure that a “no deal” exit does not occur at that point,” JPMorgan said. “We continue to think it likely that, rather than allowing the vote and consequent ministerial resignations to occur, PM May will attempt to forestall by stating that she will seek an extension herself.” Most major banks got the 2016 referendum wrong. The consensus then was that the United Kingdom would not vote to leave but as results came in showing that it had, sterling had its biggest one-day fall since the era of free-floating exchange rates was introduced in the early 1970s. In private, though, many bankers are still deeply worried about the possibility of a no-deal Brexit. “The more messy this gets the more worried I am that we are heading for no deal,” said an executive at one investment bank in London who spoke on condition of anonymity. “We still expect a last-minute deal, but the closer we get to exit day we become less sure,” the banker said. Berenberg, one of Europe’s oldest banks, said it saw the chances of May getting a majority for her deal at just 10 percent. It sees a 30 percent chance of a hard Brexit and a 20 percent chance of no Brexit. (Writing by Guy Faulconbridge; editing by Paul Sandle)"

Morgan cuts forecast for U.S. rate hikes NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co on Thursday cut its estimates of where the U.S. Federal Reserve will leave interest rates over the next two years, with just one hike this year and another in 2020. The bank previously forecast two quarter-point federal funds rate hikes this year to a target range of up to 3 percent and another two increases in 2020, to 3.5 percent. “With a Fed more tolerant, even welcoming, of an inflation overshoot, we see less near-term tightening in our forecast,” economist Michael Feroli wrote in a research note. “The more dovish policy path should allow the economy to continue growing faster than potential longer than previously projected.”"
8.537549241326788," JPMorgan Chase to create digital coins using blockchain for payments (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co said on Thursday it plans to launch its own digital coins, called “JPM Coin”, that customers will be able to use for instant transfer of payments over a blockchain network. The largest U.S. bank by assets said customers, on depositing money at the bank, will be issued the cryptocurrency that they will be able to use for transactions over the network with other JPMorgan clients. The coin can be redeemed for a U.S. dollar, so its value will largely remain stable, the bank said bit.ly/2V0lFsV. When one client sends money to another over the blockchain, JPM Coins are transferred and instantaneously redeemed for the equivalent amount of U.S. dollars, reducing the typical settlement time, the bank said. Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon once criticized the former high-flying bitcoin, calling it a “fraud” in 2017. Back then Dimon said cryptocurrencies are “worse than tulips bulbs,” referring to a famous market bubble from the 1600s. He tempered his view a few months later, saying he regretted calling bitcoin a fraud, but maintained his disinterest in the cryptocurrency. The bank said in a presentation on its website discussing the new JPM Coin that it was supportive of “cryptocurrencies as long as they are properly controlled and regulated.” “As a globally regulated bank, we believe we have a unique opportunity to develop the capability in a responsible way with the oversight of our regulators,” said JPMorgan’s Head of digital treasury services and blockchain Umar Farooq. JPMorgan also said it believed in the potential of blockchain technology, and expects its new digital coin to yield significant benefits for blockchain use by reducing clients’ counterparty and settlement risk, decreasing capital requirements and enabling instant value transfer. Last year, several big U.S. lenders including JPMorgan, banned the purchase of bitcoins by credit-card customers. Rival Goldman Sachs also ditched its plan to open a desk for cryptocurrency trading. JPMorgan said its new coin, which will be issued on its in-house blockchain technology Quorum, was currently a prototype. The company plans to make the coin operable on all standard blockchain networks."

JP Morgan was one of the organisers of the deal. * Last week, Gazprom placed the 7-year Eurobond with a yield of 5.15 percent, Refinitiv IFR reported. The deal took place days after the U.S. Treasury lifted sanctions on major Russian companies Rusal and En+. * “About half of the book came in from American investors. This is the evidence that the market has a rather constructive attitude towards Russian borrowers, and Gazprom, in particular,” Tavrovsky said. * The rest of the demand came mostly from Europe, while less than 10 percent came from Russia and less than 3 percent from Asia, Kirill Kondrashin, head of debt capital markets at JP Morgan in Russia and CIS, added. * According to Kondrashin, initial demand for Gazprom’s Eurobond exceeded $5 billion, but this had declined to $3.5 billion by the time the book closed as the company had cut its yield guidance. * It was the first Russian dollar-denominated Eurobond since February 2018 and Gazprom’s largest dollar-denominated Eurobond since 2009, Tavrovsky said. * “The demand was very high, it was obvious that investors were hungry for quality issues from Russia. In fact, Gazprom has opened the market for placements in dollars for Russian borrowers after a long break,” he added. * The share of U.S. dollar-denominated debt in Gazprom’s net debt had fallen to 34 percent as of mid-2018 from 46 percent at the end of 2016, while the share of euro debt had risen to 38 percent from 34 percent.

11.949167982525493," JPMorgan appoints former Finland leader Aho to advisory body LONDON (Reuters) - JPMorgan has appointed former Finnish Prime Minister Esko Aho to its Europe, Middle East and Africa advisory council, according to a memo seen by Reuters on Friday, as the Wall Street bank prepares its strategy for the region after Brexit. The memo, signed by Walter Gubert, Chairman of JPMorgan in EMEA, was shared with bank staff on Friday and said insights from Aho’s political and business career would be “invaluable” to the bank’s clients. A spokesman for the bank confirmed the content of the memo but declined to comment further. Aho became Finland’s youngest-ever Prime Minister in 1991, aged just 36, and went on to preside over Finland’s accession to the European Union in 1995. News of the appointment comes less than 50 days before Britain - home to JPMorgan’s EMEA headquarters - is due to cut ties with the EU, in a move likely to transform the way global financial institutions do business across the bloc. Until now, banks like JPMorgan have used Britain as a gateway to access clients based across the EU. But a loss of so-called passporting rights from March 29 has forced the bank and several rivals to redistribute assets and capital from London to much smaller operations in other hubs including Paris and Frankfurt. These moves, together with the relocation of hundreds of staff, aim to keep business running smoothly until a new trade deal covering cross border financial services between Britain and the EU is struck. Aho will join other members of the JPMorgan EMEA council in advising on the bank’s strategy in the region. He served as a member of the Finnish Parliament for two decades from 1983 and was chair of the country’s Centre Party from 1990 until 2002.

Pinterest’s IPO preparations come at a time when social media companies such as Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc are under fire from politicians for concerns about privacy and political bias, challenges that Pinterest has avoided. Pinterest could raise around $1.5 billion in the IPO, which is likely to come in the first six months of 2019, the sources said, requesting anonymity to discuss the planning arrangements. Pinterest, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan declined to comment. Pinterest, which was valued at $12 billion in its last fundraising round in 2017, is among a host of technology startups with popular consumer brands gearing up for multi-billion IPOs in 2019, including Uber, Lyft, AirBnB and Slack. The San Francisco-based company has grown rapidly since its founding in 2008, boasting 250 million monthly active users last September. Its revenue in 2018 was $700 million, 50 percent higher than the previous year, according to a person familiar with the matter. Pinterest monetizes its website through advertisements, which it places among the “pins” that users put on the site.

11.367384960212394," Crypto value unproven, blockchain years away from mainstream: JP Morgan LONDON (Reuters) - The value of cryptocurrencies is unproven and the widely-hyped blockchain technology that grew out of them will not make any real difference to banks for at least three to five years, JP Morgan analysts said on Thursday. The comments underscored widespread scepticism about the assets by established finance firms, while offering some succor for advocates of blockchain who are still waiting to see it take root. Last year bitcoin, the original and biggest digital coin, lost nearly three quarters in value, putting the brakes on cautious curiosity from mainstream finance and investors that emerged during its vertiginous ascent in 2017. JP Morgan said it was skeptical of the value of cryptocurrencies - suggesting the assets would only make sense in a dystopian scenario where investors have lost all faith in gold, the dollar, other major reserve assets and the global payments system. “Even in extreme scenarios such as a recession or financial crises, there are more liquid and less-complicated instruments for transacting, investing and hedging,” it said in a report on on crypto and blockchain. Using bitcoin futures trading volumes as a proxy, JP Morgan said participation by financial institutions in crypto markets had slipped over the last six months, with individuals taking up an increasing share of the market. Pension funds and asset managers have largely stayed clear, despite some advances in market infrastructure that have seen safer methods to store digital money emerge, with most worried about volatility, security flaws and propensity for illicit usage. The usage of cryptocurrencies for payments - the intended purpose of bitcoin - will remain “challenged,” JP Morgan said, adding that it was unable to pinpoint any major retailers that accepted digital coins in 2018. Marketplaces where small businesses and individuals have control over payment methods would prove most fertile ground for the spread of cryptocurrencies, it said, citing a Reuters analysis of the usage of bitcoin in commerce. Bitcoin, which stood at around $3,565 in afternoon trade, is likely to have cost support at around $2,400, and could fall below $1,260 if a bear market persists, JPMorgan said. The New York-based bank struck a more optimistic tone on blockchain. The shared ledger technology, which can process and settle transactions in minutes without third-parties for checks, has the potential to cut costs for global banks and digitalize complex process, it said. Trade finance would likely benefit from blockchain, the bank said, cautioning that the lack of integration between private platforms could present a stumbling block for wider use."

11.19997804038592," MIDEAST DEBT-Gulf gets boost as billions pour in before bond index entry * JPMorgan indexes inclusion to start on Jan. 31 * Could generate up to $40 bln in inflows * Emirates NBD estimates over $15 bln already in * New money helps compress GCC debt spreads * Saudi outperforms after Khashoggi volatility DUBAI, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Government bonds issued by Saudi Arabia and four other Gulf states are outperforming debt from other regions, on expectations their inclusion in JPMorgan’s bond indexes will pull in up to $40 billion in foreign investment. JPMorgan told investors in September that Saudi Arabia, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Kuwait – all members of the Gulf Cooperation Council – would join its emerging-market government bond indexes this year, in phases starting Jan. 31 and running to Sept. 30. The indexes are performance benchmarks for emerging-market debt; membership can help a country sell bonds and cut borrowing costs. Fund managers estimated index inclusion will generate $30 billion to $40 billion by September. “We estimate roughly $30 billion to 35 billion would be the total inflow by September 2019,” said Parth Kikani, director o fixed income at Emirates NBD Asset Management. “However, the majority of that (more than half) would be active money that has already come in.” More than $15 billion in new money has already been invested in GCC sovereign debt before the index entry, Kikani said. GCC governments have become some of the biggest debt issuers globally over the past few years, tapping international capital markets to plug budget deficits caused by a slump in oil prices. They will represent around 11.2 percent of JPMorgan’s EMBI Global Diversified and EMBI Global series, JPMorgan said in September. Saudi Arabia’s bond spreads rose late last year amid an emerging-market sell-off and oil price volatility; the fallout from the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, in early October, added further pressure. Option-adjusted spreads of Saudi Arabia’s debt due in 2026 rose 53 basis points since early October until the end of the year. By comparison, spreads on 2026 bonds issued by similarly rated Chile rose 39 bps during the same period. But since the beginning of the year spreads on Saudi bonds have fallen significantly, in line with Chile. That decline was partly caused by yields tightening across emerging markets and partly by foreign investors returning to snap up a $7.5 billion Saudi bond issue in January. SPREAD COMPRESSION Fund managers said a rebound in oil prices and rekindled risk appetite as well as a strong bid from investors before the index inclusion all helped GCC spread compression. Some dedicated index investors will wait for the final inclusion to put their money to work, said Sergey Dergachev, senior portfolio manager at Germany-based Union Investment. However, “expectations matter” for the large group of EMBI indexed investors, he added. Countries with liquid debt curves -- Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, and Qatar -- have benefited the most so far. Dergachev expects overall regional spreads to continue to move in line with global emerging-market debt. Fluctuations will depend on oil prices and such factors as China’s economic growth, geopolitical issues and interest rates hikes. But he also expected they will be “somewhat supported still from EMBI inclusion euphoria, so if markets stay in the same mood as they are now, GCC should benefit and be a marginal outperformer versus other regions.” The minimum size for inclusion in the indexes is $500 million, and during the inclusion, instruments will need to have a maturity date beyond March 2022, JPMorgan said.

The final months of 2018 were dominated by investor worries about slowing global growth and the U.S.-China trade dispute and were further aggravated by concerns that the Fed might be pushing interest rates too high. The resulting volatility in equity, bond and commodity markets sent many investors to the sidelines, pushing down bond trading volume and hurting the value of credit market assets sitting on banks’ own books. “You had a one-two punch of market losses on inventory along with a lot of bank clients stepping back from market because you couldn’t have much of an opinion given the uncertainty,” said Jeffery Harte, bank analyst at Sandler O’Neill & Partners. Credit spreads, the measure of additional compensation investors demand for owning riskier corporate securities over safer U.S. Treasuries, widened in the fourth quarter by the most in more than seven years both for investment-grade and high-yield, or junk, bonds, according to ICE BofAML index data. Moreover, corporate bond issuance largely dried up, slicing into underwriting fees. As quarterly results spilled out this week, it became clear that it all added up to a sizable hit for Wall Street’s biggest players. Bank of America said fixed income fees fell 5 percent because of lower debt underwriting and advisory fees, while its adjusted sales and trading revenue fell 6 percent, with a 15 percent fall in bond trading. Goldman Sachs’ bond trading revenue slid 18 percent to $822 million, far from its peak of more than $6 billion. In both cases, a big surge in equity trading volumes during the quarter helped offset those losses. But JPMorgan missed profit estimates for the fourth quarter as its bond trading revenue slump overpowered strong consumer loan growth. At Citigroup, Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach said for much of the quarter corporate and investor clients “remained on the sidelines, waiting for some clearer market conditions.” Citi reported a 21 percent fall in revenue in its markets and securities business for the quarter. After being slow to address the spasms in financial markets, Fed officials in recent weeks have said they are mindful of how such moves have tightened financial conditions. The Fed raised interest rates four times in 2018, but since the start of this year a chorus of Fed officials, including Chairman Jerome Powell, have come out to pledge that they will take it slow from here. That dovish tone has investors in a better mood so far in the first quarter. The S&P 500 is up more than 11 percent from its Dec. 24 low and junk bonds are enjoying their strongest start to a year in a decade, according to ICE BofAML’s high-yield index. The S&P bank sector has risen 17.5 percent since its Dec. 24 low, including a 5.6 percent gain since Citigroup kicked off earnings season on Monday. Even as “the potential for tape-bombs from trade and political developments still present challenges, the dovish pivot at the Fed has helped calmed markets,” said Craig Bishop, lead strategist for U.S. fixed income strategies at RBC Wealth Management. “This has contributed to tamping down fixed income volatility, so to me it could be just a matter of one bad month/quarter.” But no one is quite ready to dismiss the possibility that the environment could change quickly again for the worse. “That could change tomorrow,” said Sandler O’Neill’s Harte. “That’s the trouble with trading revenues, they’re awfully volatile. But at least today the first quarter is looking a lot better than the fourth.”"

8.950871589946143," JPMorgan misses fourth-quarter profit estimates as bond trading slumps (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N missed profit estimates for the fourth quarter as a slump in bond trading revenue overpowered strong consumer loan growth and record revenues. It was the first time JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank by assets, has underperformed earnings-per-share expectations in 16 quarters, according to Barclays equity analyst Jason Goldberg. JPMorgan was the second large U.S. bank to point the finger at choppy markets in December for its bond revenue losses. Citigroup Inc C.N on Monday posted a sharp drop in fixed income revenue, blaming widening credit spreads, or the premium investors demand for holding corporate bonds over safer U.S. Treasury securities. Goldman Sachs GS.N and Morgan Stanley MS.N, which report earnings later this week, are likely to say they experienced the same effects in their large fixed-income trading businesses. Well Fargo & Co WFC.N, which relies less on trading, said on Tuesday that fourth-quarter revenue missed expectations as revenue across all its banking units declined, especially at community banking. Despite an 18 percent drop in JPMorgan’s quarterly fixed-income revenue, Chief Financial Officer Marianne Lake said one down quarter does not make a trend. “The outlook for growth in the economy is still strong,” she said on an analyst call. “The consumer is still strong and healthy. We are expecting to see maybe slower but still global growth going forward.” Its shares edged up 0.7 percent to close at $101.68. (GRAPHIC: JPMorgan Corporate & Investment Bank Revenue breakdown - tmsnrt.rs/2T1tf65) The bank increased its provision for credit losses by $240 million from a year earlier, with roughly two-thirds for commercial and industrial loans. Lake said the rise in provisions were “driven by literally a handful of names across a handful of sectors.” ‘MORE PARANOID THAN YOU ARE’ Asked about any broader concerns over clients’ credit-worthiness, Lake said, “There’s nothing to see right now in our portfolios and we’re looking. We’re more paranoid than you are.” JPMorgan’s equities trading revenue rose 2 percent from a year earlier, helped by strength in prime brokerage, which serves hedge fund clients. Investment banking revenue rose 3 percent on higher advisory fees, even as underwriting fees declined. Revenue in asset and wealth management fell 5 percent as market declines translated into lower asset levels and management and performance fees. Trading desks at banks have been shaken by global growth concerns and the ongoing trade war between the United States and China. Bank stocks underperformed the S&P 500 index .SPX in 2018 by 13 percent. On a conference call with reporters, JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said the partial U.S. government shutdown will hurt the U.S. economy if it persists. “We don’t know exactly what it is going to do, but it is not a positive,” he said. JPMorgan said expenses rose 6 percent, outpacing revenue growth as it invested in technology, marketing and real estate. Net income increased 67 percent to $7.07 billion, or $1.98 per share, from a year ago, when it took a one-time charge due to the U.S. tax overhaul. But it missed analysts’ average estimate of $2.20 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Net interest income was up 9 percent to $14.5 billion on higher interest rates in 2018. The bank’s average core loan book grew 6 percent from the year-earlier quarter. Revenue rose 4.1 percent to $26.80 billion, shy of the average analyst expectation of $26.83 billion."

JPMorgan Chase & Co fell 2.1 percent in premarket trading after the biggest U.S. lender by assets reported a lower-than-expected rise in quarterly profit and revenue, hurt by weakness in bond trading. Wells Fargo & Co, due to report results later in the morning, slipped 0.9 percent. UnitedHealth Group kicked off the earnings season for health insurers, reporting a better-than-expected quarterly profit, helped mainly by growth in its services business. Shares of the company, however, were little changed. At 7:16 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 0.03 percent. S&P 500 e-minis were up 0.09 percent and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 0.34 percent. Futures were up more than half a percent after Chinese officials came out in force hinting at more stimulus in the near term for their slowing economy especially after surprising contractions in China’s December trade and factory activity. Providing some relief over the trade front, U.S. President Trump said on Monday he thought a trade deal with China was possible. Concerns about the impact of trade war on global growth along with rising interest rates have taken a toll on fourth-quarter corporate profit expectations. Analysts now expect S&P 500 earnings to grow 14.3 percent in the fourth quarter, much lower than the 20.1 percent growth forecast in October, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Despite declines in the past two days, the benchmark S&P 500 remains nearly 10 percent higher from its December lows. The index is about 14 percent away from its September record close.

12.161892726949302," Former banking executive Walter Shipley dead at 83: JPMorgan Chase (Reuters) - Walter Shipley, a former banking executive credited with helping spur a series of mergers that led to the creation of JPMorgan Chase JPM.N, has died at age 83, the company said on Saturday. Shipley was “a critical force behind what is now JPMorgan Chase,” Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said in a note to employees. He died on Friday, Dimon said. The company did not provide details on Shipley’s death. Shipley served as chairman and chief executive of both Chase Manhattan Bank and Chemical Bank, Dimon said, and retired in 1999, the year before Chase acquired J.P. Morgan. Over four decades, he helped to orchestrate mergers with Texas Commerce Bank in 1987, Manufacturers Hanover in 1991 and Chase Manhattan Bank in 1995. “Walter had a vision of where the banking industry was going, and he had the courage and ability to act,” former Chase CEO Bill Harrison said in a statement. Born the son of a Wall Street investment banker in Newark, New Jersey, Shipley was forced to leave Williams College due to poor grades. The six-foot, eight-inch former basketball captain subsequently had to work and pay for his education, and attended night school determined to prove himself to his family, the bank said in an obituary. Dimon said Shipley was widely respected as a “straight shooter” who fostered an open, entrepreneurial meritocracy. He is survived by five children, seven grandchildren, two siblings and a companion, the bank said."

JPMorgan employees who can look forward to bonus payments likely include those in the equities trading division. Equity markets revenue was up 17 percent in third quarter of 2018 over the prior year. JPMorgan reports fourth quarter earnings on Tuesday. JPMorgan is known as one of the stingier banks on Wall Street in terms of how much it pays revenue-generating employees. In 2017, the largest U.S. bank spent $7.5 billion on total compensation, which includes bonuses as well as salaries and other employee-related expenses, like health benefits. That represented 31 percent of overall revenue. In its investment bank, that amount was $2 billion last year, representing a compensation ratio of 27 percent.

5.251459479812779," Highest number of emerging economies will raise rates this year since 2006: JP Morgan LONDON (Reuters) - This year will see more emerging market countries raise interest rates than at any point since the pre-financial crisis uplands of 2006, analysts at JP Morgan predict. A presentation by the U.S. investment bank showed 19 of the 24 emerging economies it follows are likely to lift borrowing rates. Only one country, Malaysia, will keep them on hold, while Nigeria, India, China and Turkey are set to cut their rates. The list wasn’t exhaustive, and didn’t include the likes of Argentina, for example, which more than doubled its interest rates to an eyewatering 60 percent last year as its currency collapsed. JP Morgan’s global head of research, Joyce Chang, who made the presentation, said the expected pace of hikes could end up being slower if the U.S. Federal Reserves keeps its own increases to a minimum. However, the trend will still be upwards and shows the turnaround seen in emerging markets over the last 12 months. Between 2015 and early 2018 developing countries, big and small from Brazil and Russia to Armenia and Zambia slashed interest rates, sending borrowing costs sinking and fund managers’ profits soaring. From February last year, though, the resurgent dollar and higher U.S. borrowing costs hit currencies hard, particularly Argentina and Turkey’s, prompting EM central banks to raise rates instead. The result was that hikes outstripped cuts for eight straight months after April - the longest such run since mid 2011. (GRAPHIC: Shifting gears - tmsnrt.rs/2MupTVW) Chang’s presentation showed that the emerging market average rate will go up to just over 5 percent this year, from around 4.7 percent now. Still JP Morgan expects local currency emerging market bonds to have a much better year than they did last year despite the moves. It sees the asset class earning investors just over 6 percent, which is virtually what they lost last year. It also forecast dollar-denominated EM debt will gain 2.2 percent compared to the 4.3 percent that it lost in 2018. (GRAPHIC: Emerging market rate hikes - tmsnrt.rs/2ADZXmK)"

-0.747579016901841," Citigroup, JPMorgan to pay $182.5 million to settle rate-rigging lawsuit NEW YORK (Reuters) - Citigroup Inc and JPMorgan Chase & Co will pay $182.5 million to settle U.S. investor litigation claiming they violated antitrust law by conspiring with other banks to rig a key European interest rate benchmark. A preliminary settlement addressing the banks’ alleged manipulation of the European Interbank Offered Rate, or Euribor, was filed on Wednesday night with the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, and requires a judge’s approval. Five banks have reached $491.5 million of settlements in the case, including earlier settlements of $170 million by Deutsche Bank AG, $94 million by Barclays Plc and $45 million by HSBC Holdings Plc. Euribor is the euro-denominated equivalent of Libor, a benchmark for setting rates on hundreds of trillions of dollars of credit cards, student loans, mortgages and other debt. Investors including the California State Teachers’ Retirement System (CalSTRS) pension fund accused banks of rigging Euribor and fixing prices of Euribor-based derivatives from June 2005 to March 2011 to profit at their expense. According to the settlement agreement, Citigroup and JPMorgan denied wrongdoing, and settled to avoid the cost and distraction of litigation. Several banks remain defendants. Citigroup spokeswoman Danielle Romero-Apsilos and JPMorgan spokeswoman Tasha Pelio declined to comment on Friday. Vincent Briganti, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, also declined to comment. Many lawsuits in the Manhattan court seek to hold banks liable for alleged rigging in interest rate, commodity, currency and other financial markets. JPMorgan this week reached a separate $7 million settlement of investor claims that it conspired with rivals to rig the Australian Bank Bill Swap Reference Rate, becoming the first bank to settle that litigation. The same law firms represented investors in that case and the Euribor case. The case is Sullivan et al v. Barclays Plc et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 13-02811."
-3.79973383363445," Berkshire invests in JPMorgan, Oracle as Buffett puts cash to work (Reuters) - Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc deepened its commitment to the U.S. financial industry, announcing a $4.02 billion stake in JPMorgan Chase & Co and new investments in PNC Financial Services Group Inc and Travelers Companies Inc, plus a stake in Oracle Corp. The investments were disclosed in a Wednesday regulatory filing detailing Berkshire’s U.S.-listed stocks as of Sept. 30, following a quarter when the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate spent $17.7 billion on equities. According to the filing, Berkshire owned $829 million of PNC stock, $460 million of the insurer Travelers, and $2.13 billion of Oracle, the database software company. It also added to its sizable stakes in two earlier Buffett investments, Bank of America Corp and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. “While nervous investors fear the end of the economic recovery, Mr. Buffett is buying economically sensitive bank stocks,” said Bill Smead, who runs Smead Capital Management Inc in Seattle and owns Berkshire stock. “It makes owners like us not mind sitting through a correction with them.” Though the filing did not say which individual purchases Buffett or his investment managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler were responsible for, investors watch Berkshire’s quarterly stock listings for signs about where the trio sees value. Shares of JPMorgan, PNC and Travelers each rose at least 1 percent in after-hours trading following Berkshire’s disclosure of its new stakes, while Oracle shares rose 2.4 percent. JPMorgan and Travelers declined to comment. PNC, Oracle and Buffett’s assistant did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The investment in JPMorgan, where Combs is a board member, closes a notable hole in Berkshire’s portfolio. Berkshire had already been the largest investor in several companies, including American Express Co, Bank of America, Bank of New York Mellon Corp, US Bancorp and Wells Fargo & Co, according to Refinitiv data. Buffett has long praised the leadership of JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, and over the last year partnered with him and Amazon.com Inc Chief Executive Jeff Bezos to create a new company aiming to cut U.S. employee healthcare costs. Atul Gawande, a surgeon and critic of medical industry practices, was named in June to lead the venture. Buffett and Dimon also teamed up in June to call on companies to stop giving quarterly earnings forecasts, because they encourage an unhealthy focus on short-term profit at the expense of sustainable long-term growth. Berkshire has more than 90 businesses in the insurance, energy, food and retail, industrial, railroad and other sectors. Buffett, however, has not made a major acquisition since buying aircraft parts maker Precision Castparts in January 2016.

-5.063579859271824," Bank of France partners with JPMorgan to boost gold bullion services: sources LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of France has partnered with U.S. banking group JPMorgan JPM.N to expand its range of gold bullion services for central banks, sources familiar with the matter said on Monday. The French central bank’s second deputy governor Sylvie Goulard wrote in the Alchemist, the magazine of the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA), that it had partnered with “a large commercial bank” to offer swaps, leases and gold deposits from Paris. Sources said the bank was JPMorgan, one of the world’s largest bullion trading banks and a member of a group that settles trades in London’s $25 billion a day gold market. The Bank of England acts as a gold custodian and service provider for many other central banks and has the advantage of operating within the London market, by far the world’s largest commercial bullion trading pool. Until now central banks holding gold at the Bank of France had to go through London if they wanted to perform market transactions. JPMorgan said it had “opened an account with Bank of France” and declined to comment further. The Bank of France declined to comment. One source said the Bank of France was positioning itself to take advantage of uncertainty over Britain’s withdrawal from the EU, thinking that some central banks may seek alternatives to London. “They are convinced that Brexit is going to change things and they want to be there,” the source said. “They are pitching to European potential customers.” Such a move would fit into a wider push by Paris to become a European financial markets hub after Brexit. The head of the Bank of France said in May it aimed to be “the markets’ central bank in Europe”. The Bank of France began to expand gold services in 2012, Goulard said in the Alchemist article. It is also renovating its vaults to allow operations by heavy forklift trucks, and upgrading the quality of its gold reserves so they can trade on the international market, she said."
-4.085734185120565," JPMorgan spreads its urban development money to Paris NEW YORK/PARIS (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, the biggest U.S. bank by assets, said on Sunday that it has selected impoverished areas around Paris as the first foreign focus of an urban economic development strategy it started four years ago in Detroit. The bank will contribute $30 million over five years to programs to teach job skills and expand small businesses in Seine-Saint-Denis and other places with high unemployment and poverty, JPMorgan said in a statement provided to Reuters. Located north of Paris, Seine-Saint-Denis has the highest poverty and crime rates in France. Dotted with large social housing projects, the area is separated from wealthy Paris only by an extremely congested highway circling the city. The area was in the center of the riots that devastated suburbs all over France a decade ago. CEO Jamie Dimon planned to follow the announcement with a visit to the city on Tuesday. Dimon has been leaving more day-to-day operations of the New York-based bank to lieutenants while he promotes policies and public-private partnerships which he believes will promote economic growth. His advocacy work has been primarily in the United States where JPMorgan earns about 80 percent of its revenue. The Paris effort is part of JPMorgan’s “Advancing Cities” program, which builds on investments of $150 million in Detroit and $40 million in Chicago, cities where JPMorgan has the biggest market share of bank deposits. JPMorgan executives have said they want more business abroad, particularly commercial lending to mid-sized companies. JPMorgan employs about 200 people in France among some 255,000 worldwide. JPMorgan employees in Paris work in investment banking, money management and capital markets. They do not serve low-income individuals or small businesses who could be the first to benefit from the new effort. Peter Scher, JPMorgan Head of Corporate Responsibility, said the program will provide workers the skills needed by the bank’s business clients, some of which are in office towers near areas where unemployment rates reach 35 percent. “That is a good bet for the economy and it is a good bet for our firm,” said Scher. The job training will focus on the construction, information technology and environmental sustainability industries which are important in France, he said. The $30 million for Paris is part of $500 million JPMorgan said in September that it would spend in as many as 30 cities, including some outside of the United States. JPMorgan reported net income in 2017 of $24.4 billion."

0.2752908152121648," International transactions and sanctions compliance duties highlighted by JPMorgan lapses NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence) - The U.S. Treasury Department’s $5.3 million settlement last week with JPMorgan Chase and Co. over suspected sanctions violations highlights the government’s continued focus on sanctions and the adequacy of screening procedures. It also underscores the importance of corporate self-reporting and remediation in limiting penalties, and offers compliance lessons on avoiding control lapses that can lead to penalties and bad publicity. The settlement between JPMorgan and Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control{here} involved suspected violations by the bank's J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, NA unit of economic sanctions related to Cuba, Iran, and designated proliferators of weapons of mass destruction. OFAC said the transactions were net-settlement payments, some of which were attributable to airlines on OFAC’s list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons (SDN List), blocked under OFAC sanctions, or located in countries subject to the sanctions programs administered by OFAC. OFAC said JPMorgan voluntarily self-disclosed the apparent violations and said they constituted a “non-egregious case.” It said the bank had operated a settlement mechanism that resolved billings among airlines and other participants in the airline industry on behalf of its client, a U.S. entity and with approximately 100 members, and a non-U.S. entity and its over 350 members. It said that from 2008 to 2012 the bank processed 87 transactions through the U.S. financial system that may have contained interests attributable to a sanctions-targeted party. OFAC said that before January 2012 the bank lacked a process to independently evaluate the participants of the non-U.S. person entity for OFAC sanctions risk, despite receiving red flag notifications regarding OFAC-sanctioned members on at least three occasions. As a result the bank for a number of years processed net settlement payments that appear to have violated OFAC sanctions programs. Separately, OFAC cited the parent company for the same subsidiary’s violation of sanctions regulations regarding Syria and suspected foreign narcotics kingpins. OFAC said that from approximately 2007 to October 2013, JPMC processed 85 transactions totaling $46,127 and maintained eight accounts on behalf of six customers who were at the same time identified on the SDN List. It issued a “Finding of Violation,” which did not carry a penalty. OFAC cited as aggravating factors in the net-settlement case: --JPMorgan appears to have acted with reckless disregard for its sanctions compliance obligations when it failed to screen participants in the net settlement mechanism with JPMorgan’s clients for purposes of OFAC compliance, despite having the necessary information to do so; --The bank missed red flags and other warning signs on several occasions, including twice in 2011 when its client notified the bank about OFAC sanctioned entities participating in the settlement mechanism; --The bank was aware that it processed net settlement transactions on behalf of the two member organizations on a weekly basis, and, given the bank’s involvement in reconciling the organizations’ billings against each other, JPMorgan staff members had actual knowledge of the individual members, including OFAC-sanctioned entities, involved in each transaction; and --JPMorgan activity helped several entities subject to OFAC sanctions and harmed the integrity of a number of OFAC sanctions programs. As a big, internationally sophisticated bank, JPMorgan should have known better, OFAC indicated. OFAC also considered as mitigating factors: --No JPMorgan managers or supervisors appear to have been aware of the conduct or transactions that led to the apparent violations; --The harm to OFAC sanctions programs was significantly less than the total value of the transactions, because the transactions represented net settlements between numerous parties, of which the sanctioned entities were only a few; --The bank cooperated with OFAC’s investigation, including by agreeing to suspend the statute of limitations; and --JPMorgan has taken steps as part of a risk-based sanctions compliance program to prevent future similar violations. As examples of the remedial efforts, OFAC said that, between February 2012 and the time JPMorgan ended its relationship with its U.S. entity client, the bank screened all net settlement participants to prevent sanctioned entities from utilizing the process; it increased its compliance staff; it implemented new sanctions-screening software; and it incorporated these apparent violations as a case study for training purposes. In the net-settlement case, the enforcement “highlights the risks associated with a U.S. person failing to take adequate steps to ensure that transactions that it processes are compliant with U.S. economic sanctions laws — particularly in instances in which a U.S. person has actual knowledge or reason to know, prior to the transaction being effected, of an SDN’s past, present, or future interest in such a transaction,” OFAC said. In citing JPMorgan for violating the narcotics kingpin and Syrian sanctions regulations, OFAC said that from 2007 to 2013, JPMorgan had used a vendor screening system that failed to identify six customers as potential matches to the SDN List. The system’s screening logic capabilities failed to identify customer names with hyphens, initials, or additional middle or last names as potential matches to similar or identical names on the SDN List. Despite strong similarities between the account holder’s names, addresses, and dates of birth in JPMorgan account documentation and on the SDN List, JPMorgan maintained accounts for or processed transactions on behalf of these six customers. The bank identified weaknesses in the screening tool’s capabilities as early as September 2010 and implemented a series of enhancements from 2010 to 2012. In 2013, JPMorgan transitioned to a new screening system. In November 2013, JPMorgan re-screened 188 million clients’ records through the new system, identified the questionable transactions and accounts, and reported the violations to OFAC. “This enforcement action highlights the importance of financial institutions remediating known compliance program deficiencies in an expedient manner, and when that is not possible, the importance of implementing compensating controls to mitigate risk until a comprehensive solution can be deployed,” OFAC said. In other recent sanctions cases: -- U.S. federal and state authorities informed Standard Chartered Bank that they are preparing to bring criminal charges against two of the bank’s former employees over alleged sanction breaches involving Iran-linked companies, the Financial Times reported on Monday. The report said prosecutors were also seeking to fine Standard Chartered about $1.5 billion in a probe based on allegations the bank continued to breach such Iran sanctions by processing U.S. dollar transactions -- even after it paid a $667 fine in a 2012 settlement for such violations. Standard Chartered PLC chief executive Bill Winters told senior staff on Tuesday that the bank is working on an “acceptable resolution” with these authorities. He said most of the transactions in question date to before 2012. As part of it 2012 deferred prosecution agreement (DPA) with the U.S. Treasury, the bank said it had stopped working with Iranian and Iranian-connected companies, the FT said. StanChart closed its Tehran office in May 2012, the newspaper said. The bank was subject to an independent monitor appointed to oversee its effort to improve its sanctions compliance program under its DPA; that agreement has already been extended twice, as the monitor has found supposed remedial efforts inadequate. -- U.S. authorities last year alleged in civil and criminal charges that Chinese handset maker ZTE illegally shipped telecommunications equipment to Iran and North Korea. ZTE was also charged with obstruction for making false statements to the US. Commerce Department and destroying export records. ZTE paid $1.19 billion in penalties to settle the 2017 case and promised to fire four senior employees and discipline 35 others by reducing their bonuses or reprimanding them. In April, the Commerce Department said ZTE had not disciplined the 35 employees. Instead it “paid full bonuses to employees that had engaged in illegal conduct, and failed to issue letters of reprimand.” The United States then revoked the business’ export privileges so ZTE was unable to get the parts manufactured in the United States that it needed to make its handsets. That caused the business to end its operations. In exchange for reinstating U.S. exports, ZTE paid a $1 billion fine, reconstituted its board and accepted a U.S.-appointed compliance department. ZTE also paid an additional $400 million that it would receive back if it honors its promises. -- In June, OFAC announced a $145,893 settlement agreement with telecommunications firm Ericsson to settle its potential civil liability for an apparent violation of OFAC’s Sudanese sanctions regulations. The violation involved employees of Ericsson units conspiring together and with employees of a third company to export and reexport a satellite hub from the United States to Sudan and to export and reexport satellite-related services from the United States to Sudan. OFAC determined that the businesses voluntarily self-disclosed the apparent violation. But it also termed the violation egregious , because the employees conspired specifically to evade a U.S. embargo on Sudan, they ignored repeated warnings from the Ericsson’s compliance department, and at least one employee was a manager. -- HSBC Holdings Plc in 2012 paid a $1.9 billion settlement for helping Mexican drug cartels launder money and for breaching international sanctions by doing business with Iran. HSBC agreed to cooperate with the U.S. Justice Department in return for not losing access to some of its most lucrative institutional banking activities in the United States. The bank was also put under the supervision of an external monitor, Michael Cherkasky, who said in a report early in his monitorship that there had been resistance from senior managers at the investment bank. HSBC purchased new technology and significantly increased its compliance team worldwide. The deferred prosecution agreement it signed with the Justice Department ended in December 2017, signaling the department’s satisfaction with the bank’s compliance enhancements. The use of sanctions by the United States government has been significant in recent years. Law firm Gibson Dunn noted in a sanctions update for 2017{here} that former U.S. President Barack Obama's administration had sharply increased its additions to sanctions lists by his last year in office, and President Donald Trump had added nearly 1,000 people, companies and entities during 2017 alone. The Sectoral Sanctions Identifications List (SSI List) also adds complexity to the sanctions compliance landscape. In July 2014, OFAC created the SSI List under an executive order authorizing sanctions against specific sectors of the Russian economy. The list has endured as a sanctions program that targets discrete areas of another country’s economy, such as its energy, mining, and defense sectors, while allowing transactions in other sectors. The sheer number of sanctions, their variety, and their constant evolution makes sanctions compliance time-consuming, costly and difficult. Companies are spending considerably to help the United States achieve national security and foreign policy goals through sanctions. Senior management and directors must make sure the company has an adequate sanctions-compliance program as well as oversight and testing to meet legal and regulatory mandates. The efforts also help avoid bad publicity that can be costly even if penalties from authorities are low. Executives and board members must also ensure there are adequate resources for the creation of an effective program and they must play a part in monitoring the organization’s risk profile through an appropriate board committee. Based on the findings of a 2017 survey by AlixPartners, however, it seems many boards are falling short in achieving this goal. Out of 361 financial institutions that participated in the global anti-money laundering and sanctions compliance survey, 20 percent of the institutions indicated that they “do not provide AML (anti-money laundering) and sanctions compliance training for their boards of directors or are unaware whether their boards are being briefed on AML and sanctions matters.” Sanctions screening technology can help compliance professionals by parsing data and creating alerts that streamline the searching functions. The data will pertain to customers, vendors, partners and agents, so the technology must be able to handle growing data feeds and changing search parameters, without getting tripped up by similarities in names of people, places or entities. An alert should stop the transaction and alert the end user. But this is where human judgment plays the ultimate role, by identifying false positives or even detecting where a deeper examination is warranted to purse other financial crimes. Controls built around the sanctions technology, such as the settings of the screening software, should be consistent with the risk approach of the business and periodically updated. Building a process to handle each type of alert and match takes time. The sanctions compliance program also must have a regular top-to-bottom review, at least annually, with results of the testing sent to upper management and the board. An annual risk assessment must precede this program review, however so the business determines its sanctions risks first and then builds around them. One challenge for compliance teams is embedding sanctions information into a business’s systems and workflows. Besides technology, trained staff, defined roles, escalation processes and technical scalability are needed to make the sanctions controls truly helpful. Furthermore, identifying the persons and entities that reside on the U.S. sanctions list is tough enough, but global businesses must also know which parties reside on the sanctions lists of other governments, as they will have to answer to them for transgressions.

-3.6056534621052725," JP Morgan and Ford cancel plans for Saudi investor event NEW YORK (Reuters) - JP Morgan & Chase Co JPM.N Chief Executive Jamie Dimon and Ford Motor Co F.N Chairman Bill Ford canceled plans to attend a Saudi investor conference, the companies said on Sunday, the latest such high-profile announcements after the disappearance of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The cancellations could add pressure on other U.S. firms like Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N, Mastercard Inc MA.N and Bank of America Corp BAC.N to reconsider their plans to attend the investor event. Neither JP Morgan nor Ford would elaborate on the reasons for the decision not to attend the Future Investment Initiative conference in Riyadh later this month, and did not comment on whether concerns about the disappearance of Khashoggi were a factor. Khashoggi, a U.S. resident and Washington Post columnist critical of Riyadh’s policies, disappeared on Oct. 2 after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Turkey believes he was murdered and his body removed. Saudi Arabia has denied that. The investment summit in Riyadh typically attracts executives from some of the world’s largest companies and media organizations. But it has rapidly become a vehicle for those firms to express their concerns over Khashoggi’s disappearance. U.S. President Donald Trump has threatened “severe punishment” if it turns out Khashoggi was killed in the consulate, although he said Washington would be “punishing” itself if it halted military sales to Riyadh. Major news organizations such as CNN, the Financial Times, the New York Times, CNBC and Bloomberg have pulled out of the conference. The Fox Business Network, the lone Western news outlet still heading to the conference, told Reuters on Sunday it was reviewing that decision. Uber Technologies Inc Chief Executive Dara Khosrowshahi, Viacom Inc VIAB.O CEO Bob Bakish and billionaire Steve Case, one of the founders of AOL, said they were no longer going . Goldman Sachs, Mastercard and Bank of America did not respond to requests on Sunday on whether they were still attending the event.

-5.823851840494053," JPMorgan's consumer banking strength offsets bond trading weakness (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Friday as gains from higher interest rates and growth in loans helped the bank offset weakness in bond trading revenue. The largest U.S. bank by assets, whose results are often seen as a barometer of the economy, has benefited from a tax windfall and a strong economy that has led to higher interest rates and kept loan defaults in check. All four of JPMorgan’s main businesses recorded a rise in revenue, with the consumer banking unit notching the biggest jump in revenue due to a healthy appetite for borrowing. Trading was the only weak spot in the results. Chief Executive Jamie Dimon praised President Donald Trump’s tax cuts and deregulatory efforts, but cautioned on inflation and “geopolitical issues bursting all over the place.” “The U.S. and the global economy continue to show strength, despite increasing economic and geopolitical uncertainties, which at some point in the future may have negative effects on the economy,” Dimon said. JPMorgan shares fell 2 percent late Friday afternoon. Worries about lackluster trading and weak loan growth have weighed on bank stocks this year, with the S&P Financial index .SPSY falling about 5 percent and underperforming the broader S&P 500 index .SPX. JPMorgan is the best performing stock among the big six U.S. banks. Including losses from the market carnage over the past two days that saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI drop more than 1,300 points, the stock is the only one among the big banks to be in positive territory for the year. The bank's average core loan book rose 6 percent in the third quarter and outperformed Citigroup's C.N 4 percent growth even as higher rates crimped borrowing in areas such as mortgage loans. Trading revenue fell 2.5 percent amid an escalating trade war between Beijing and Washington and worries about slowing global growth. Bond trading revenue fell 10 percent - in sharp contrast to Citigroup's C.N 9 percent increase - while equity trading revenue was up 17 percent. JPMorgan’s total revenue rose 5.2 percent to $27.82 billion. Net income rose 24.5 percent to $8.38 billion, or $2.34 per share. Analysts had expected earnings of $2.25 per share, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. “Everything looks nice and steady for JPMorgan,” Octavio Marenzi, CEO of capital markets management consultancy Opimas said. “This portends well for the rest of the US banking industry.” Net interest income - the difference between what the bank earns on loans and pay on deposits - rose 7 percent to $14.1 billion as the U.S. Federal Reserve raised rates four times since the third quarter of last year, bringing it to 2.25 percent.

-5.823851840494053," JPMorgan profit rises 24.5 pct, helped by higher interest rates Oct 12 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co reported a 24.5 percent jump in quarterly profit as higher interest rates and gains from tax cuts helped offset weakness in bond trading revenue. The largest U.S. bank by assets said net income for the third quarter rose to $8.38 billion, or $2.34 per share, from $6.73 billion, or $1.76 per share in the year ago period. Analysts had expected earnings of $2.25 per share, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv. It was not immediately clear if the reported results were comparable. Smaller rivals Citigroup Inc and Wells Fargo are also expected to report quarterly results later in the day.

-11.439793659730064," J.P. Morgan to settle allegations of violating sanctions: U.S. Treasury WASHINGTON (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Chase Bank JPM.N has agreed to pay $5.3 million to settle allegations it violated Cuban Assets Control Regulations, Iranian sanctions and Weapons of Mass Destruction sanctions 87 times, the U.S. Treasury said on Friday. Treasury also said it had found the bank violated sanctions on narcotics and Syria, when it processed 85 transactions, totaling $46,127, and maintained accounts for six sanctioned individuals. “We’re pleased to resolve this issue, which we self-identified and voluntarily disclosed more than six years ago. We have since upgraded our systems and made substantial enhancements to our sanctions compliance program,” said Brian Marchiony, a bank spokesman. Specifically on the Cuba and Iran violations, the Treasury said the bank engaged in a “very small portion” of net settlement payments that appeared to have been attributable to airline interests that were blocked by U.S. sanctions or located in countries subjected to sanctions. The Treasury said the bank voluntarily disclosed the violations, and they constituted a “non-egregious case.”"

-15.986805219645895," JPMorgan steps up push for women executives and clients NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N is expanding the reach and funding of a group established to promote women working inside the bank to also help female clients, including entrepreneurs and individuals. The bank said on Wednesday that it is backing the group with a full-time director and resources to promote savings by women and $10 billion of loans to women-owned businesses. The group, which grew out of a networking and career advancement effort started in 2013, on Wednesday held its third annual “Leadership Day” by expanding the conference to 2,000 people at Radio City Music Hall from 300 employees in a room at JPMorgan headquarters. “We are going to continue to focus on employees to make sure we have more women in senior positions, but the extension is around clients and providing access to capital,” Samantha Saperstein, the JPMorgan managing director of the group, Women on the Move, said in an interview. The move comes as a number of big banks have publicized their aspirations to have more women executives. In August, Citigroup Inc C.N said it aims to lift its share of women in mid- and senior-level executive positions to 40 percent by 2021 from the current 37 percent. In March, Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N said it was committed to having women account for 50 percent of employees globally ""over time."" Goldman does not disclose the current global percentage, but in the United States women make up 22 percent of executives and senior managers and 38 percent of total employees. Studies by university scholars and by management consultants have shown that the financial performance of firms tends to be better if they have more women in top management. One reason is believed to be the diversity of ideas and perspectives that comes from a more heterogeneous pool of executives. David Gaddis Ross, a professor at the University of Florida who has studied the issue, said in an interview that the increased attention for women from Wall Street likely reflects competition for a new generation of finance graduates who would rather work for firms that embrace diversity. JPMorgan's conference was to include talks by the five women who are on the 11-member JPMorgan Operating Committee, and interviews with JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon, Nasdaq Inc NDAQ.O CEO Adena Friedman and Girlboss Media CEO founder Sophia Amoruso."

The people asked not to be named because Tcholakian’s hiring had not yet been announced at JP Morgan. Representatives for JPMorgan and UBS representative declined to comment. Based in New York, Tcholakian has worked at UBS for nearly two decades, beginning in 1999, according to his LinkedIn page. As a managing director, Tcholakian will work under JP Morgan’s current global head of consumer retail investment banking Eric Oken. In June, Reuters reported that UBS Group had hired Deutsche Bank AG’s global co-head of consumer retail and services, Jeff Rose, to be co-chief of Americas mergers and acquisitions. Separately, the bank also appointed Solon Kentas, previously a managing director at Deutsche Bank, to help lead the Swiss bank’s U.S. consumer and retail dealmaking efforts. That move followed an April turnover in which UBS also lost three senior consumer retail bankers, Brett Pickett, Lowell Strug, and Peter Kuhn, to Barclays Plc. The changes are part of a broader reshuffle in the industry as large banks compete for talent and connections that can help them bring in banking business during a period of blockbuster consumer mergers. Retail and consumer goods giants are making large investments to quickly meet changing consumer demands while keeping costs down as shoppers’ habits and tastes change.

-13.184560859641556," WeWork tops JPMorgan as No. 1 New York tenant as coworking booms NEW YORK (Reuters) - WeWork Cos said it surpassed JP Morgan JPM.N, the biggest U.S. bank, as the largest tenant of Manhattan office space, a milestone highlighting growing demand for flexible leases. WeWork, a provider of co-work spaces with flexible leases that now has more than 50 locations in Manhattan, said in a blog post on Monday it signed a lease for 258,344 square feet at 21 Penn Plaza. The move makes it the largest private occupier of office space on the island with more than 5.3 million square feet. JPMorgan, the largest U.S. bank by assets, has 5.2 million square feet, according to brokerage Cushman & Wakefield. Flexible space accounted for 12 percent of Manhattan leasing activity in the first six months of the year, according to brokerage CBRE, and WeWork was responsible for about half of that as companies in search of extra space embrace coworking. Flex space providers sign long-term leases with a landlord and then rent the leased space to clients on a short-term basis. Coworking's appeal has become more mainstream across the United States, not just in New York. Mall operator Macerich Co MAC.N in August announced a partnership with Industrious to roll out flexible workspaces in its portfolio of high-end U.S. shopping centers. WeWork’s torrid growth has not gone unnoticed. Brookfield, one of the world’s largest property owners, plans on offering flexible space in most of the 1,000 office buildings it owns globally. “Anybody that’s not thinking about it now and not doing it risks being road kill,” said Kevin Danehey, global head of corporate development at Brookfield Properties. “From an owner’s perspective, this isn’t something where we’re just seeing this as a trend but as something that’s core to how we’re viewing the operation of our assets,” he told a Rethink conference about the future of the office two weeks ago."
-12.418011216598643," How JPMorgan's CFO became the top prospect to succeed Dimon NEW YORK (Reuters) - As a single mother with a British accent who loves numbers, Marianne Lake bears little resemblance to Jamie Dimon, the longtime chief executive of JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N, known for his bravado, quips and occasional profanity-laced outbursts. Yet Lake has emerged as a front-runner to replace Dimon when he eventually retires, Reuters interviews with more than a dozen current and former executives show. Over her nearly six years as JPMorgan’s chief financial officer Lake, 49, has taken on more and more responsibilities effectively becoming Dimon’s understudy. She helps develop strategies for each of the bank’s business units and oversees matters ranging from its annual stress test to employee cafeterias. Largely unknown outside JPMorgan when named CFO in 2012, Lake has worked in both the wholesale and retail businesses during 19 years there. “She has been all over,” Dimon, 62, said in an interview, describing Lake as an “extraordinarily talented executive.” “She has all of the qualities of a great leader,” he said. Those include being demanding, drawing information out of people and recognizing talent within the 15,000 people she oversees. Dimon said she also challenges him when she believes he is wrong. Lake, who also spoke to Reuters, said she wanted to broaden her skillset in her next job and has made her ambitions clear to the board chaired by Dimon. She declined to predict whether she will be the next CEO. “I want to be at this company 10 years from now and I will be quite open-minded about what the next step could look like,” she said. “I have told the board that I want to be here for the long-term.” Dimon has been CEO for nearly 13 years, the longest tenure among major U.S. banks. He is a larger-than-life figure who steered JPMorgan through the financial crisis and regularly stands up to regulators and politicians. The question of who could succeed him has captivated Wall Street for years. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/2NbTiZo) Lake’s standing has risen as other CEO candidates have left JPMorgan after growing impatient or getting on Dimon’s wrong side, executives said. “I would put my money on her above anybody else,” said one longtime JPMorgan executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity. “She knows the bank extremely well, with her role spanning all of our businesses and functions,” said Gordon Smith, co-president of the company and chief executive of JPMorgan’s consumer bank. Dimon, who has said he will step down in about five years, would not discuss Lake’s chances. It is the board’s choice, and there are other people who could also run the company, he said. And, Dimon cautioned, “Things change...Everybody changes.” JPMorgan has said it has a succession plan and that it strives to give executives experience in its different businesses, but it does not publicly disclose the details. Two people analysts often mention as possible successors if Dimon were to suddenly leave are Smith, 60, and the other co-president Daniel Pinto, 55, who runs the investment bank. Mary Erdoes, 51, chief of asset and wealth management, and Doug Petno, 53, chief of the commercial bank, have also been cited over the years. When former CFO Douglas Braunstein stepped down in 2012 in the wake of the “London whale” scandal in which a JPMorgan trader lost more than $6 billion, Lake was one of several executives interviewing for the CFO job. In the interview, Lake credited a colleague for a piece of advice she says helped her win the promotion: Tell Dimon how much you want the job and tell him how hard you will work for him. “If you don’t tell people you really want a job, then you have no shot,” said Lake. Born in Maryland and raised by working-class parents in southern England, Lake joined JPMorgan’s London office as chief financial officer for credit trading at age 30, after working on the JPMorgan account for PricewaterhouseCoopers accounting firm. She moved to the United States in 2004 as JPMorgan was merging with Bank One, which Dimon ran before becoming CEO of the combined organization. She worked on an expensive, multi-year drive to combine JPMorgan’s data and accounting systems and the implementation of Sarbanes-Oxley accounting controls. She was controller of the investment bank during the 2007-2009 financial crisis, and ran finances for the retail bank as the mortgage business went through drastic changes afterward. Dimon named her to the current post in November 2012 and colleagues were stunned by her intensity in preparing for her first quarterly results presentation in January. “She always wants to understand the why behind the things she would say,” recalled Sarah Youngwood, then head of investor relations. “It is still happening to this day.” Lake talks too fast for some people to keep up. “That is because she thinks so fast, but she has slowed it down,” said Youngwood, who now has Lake’s old job of CFO for the consumer bank. Lake said she sometimes counts to herself to reduce the pace. Bank analysts say they welcome all of the information Lake packs into her presentations and they like that she is quick to thoroughly address questions on investor minds. For example, after Goldman Sachs analyst Richard Ramsden published a report in January 2015 asking whether JPMorgan should break itself up because of new regulations, Lake made a case that the bank would thrive because of its size. “She is probably one of the most gifted CFOs around,” Ramsden said. “She is really at the top of every dynamic at JPMorgan.” Lake’s speed, demands for information, and visual memory of numbers can intimidate new hires, people who work with her said. Dimon said he and Lake sometimes challenge one another to remember numbers down to one decimal point. “We have a lot of fun with each other,” he said. Lake had her three children through a surrogate starting at the age of 42 after she decided that, even without a partner, she wanted to be a parent. She said she realized after she became CFO that her story could inspire other career-driven women at the bank and she tells it frequently. One junior colleague described Lake’s parenting decision as “fearless.” “It’s too easy to say it’s not convenient right now” to have a child, said Lake. “On big life-changing decisions like that, you just have to go for it.” In a nod to her expanding role, JPMorgan put Lake at center stage at its four-hour investor conference this year. Typically, all the business heads would give their own presentations, but this time, Lake spoke for an hour and a half, explaining strategies for each of JPMorgan’s four segments and giving an overview of how the bank is using technology to cut costs and generate more revenue. Lake says she is ready to take on a different role at JPMorgan and that the next CEO’s main challenge will be making sure JPMorgan remains the country’s most profitable big bank. “When you are a successful company,” she said, “you have to fight really hard to make sure you avoid complacency, arrogance, bureaucracy.”"

-10.039432989208638," JPMorgan looks abroad as it commits $500 million more to urban renewal NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N will provide $500 million over five years to promote economic opportunities in selected cities, including some outside the United States, the bank said Wednesday. The program builds on urban renewal strategies that the bank funded in Detroit with $150 million starting in 2014. It has since taken the approaches to Chicago with $40 million and to Washington, D.C., with $25 million. Half of the $500 million will be in philanthropic grants. The other half will provide low-cost, long-term development capital. The money will be used to teach job skills, finance small businesses of women and minority entrepreneurs, rebuild neighborhoods and to help families with their finances. The funding comes as JPMorgan Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon, 62, has turned more of his attention to public policy and economic issues as chairman of the Business Roundtable. “Businesses can and must step up to help change the status quo by creating a better future for all, no matter where they live,” Dimon said in a statement. “It is in our best interest and the right thing to do.” JPMorgan, the biggest bank in the U.S. by assets, reported net income in 2017 of $24.4 billion. The new program will make “large-scale investments” in targeted cities where the bank believes “conditions are right for success and broader, deeper investments are needed to drive inclusive growth,” the bank said. By the end of the year, the bank plans to name a “global city” for its first targeted urban investment outside of the United States. JPMorgan wants to do more business abroad and already spends some of its corporate social responsibility funds outside of the United States. In the new program, the bank is also challenging cities to submit bids for financing that would “seed innovative solutions that help drive inclusive growth.” Previously, the bank did not have a formal process to evaluate requests from cities for money. The bank looks for evidence of collaboration between public and private interests on renewal schemes in cities it supports. Based on experience in other cities, the bank said it expects its $500 million will be matched by $1 billion of outside capital."

-7.163358231494185," JPMorgan picked to run sale of Anbang' Dutch insurer Vivat: sources HONG KONG/AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - China’s Anbang Insurance Group [ANBANG.UL] has picked JPMorgan to manage the 1.4-1.8 billion euro ($1.6-$2 billion) sale of its Dutch insurance arm Vivat, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters. The Chinese government has been considering the sale of Anbang’s overseas real estate and insurance assets, which include Belgian insurer Fidea, since it took control of the troubled company in February. JPMorgan won the mandate after Anbang asked banks to pitch for a role in August, the sources said.JPMorgan declined to comment. A Vivat spokesman referred questions to Anbang. An Anbang spokesman said on Wednesday evening the review of Vivat had not been completed and a final decision would be based on the results of the review. He declined to comment further. Sources said in July the insurer was looking to offload overseas properties worth about $10 billion to shore up its balance sheet as part of a government-backed rescue. UBS and China’s CICC have wider roles advising Anbang on its restructuring. Sources said they were not handling Vivat’s sale as Anbang wanted independent advice on its European disposals. Vivat on Wednesday reported a first-half underlying result of 115 million euros, with a Solvency II ratio of 167 percent and a book value of 3.35 billion euros. Two Dutch insurers, Aegon AEGN.AS and ASR ASRNL.AS, have said they were aware Vivat was preparing a sale and would consider bidding. ASR could pay around 1.4 billion euros for Vivat, ABN Amro analyst Cor Kluis said in an email on Wednesday. Anbang bought Vivat -- the insurance arm of the defunct SNS Reaal, nationalized by the Dutch government in 2013 -- for a nominal 1 euro and a cash injection of 1.35 billion euros. However, Anbang’s foreign expansion plans suffered a setback in May when former chairman Wu Xiaohui was sentenced to 18 years in prison for fraud and embezzlement. He is appealing the conviction. In April, the Chinese government gave Anbang a 60.8 billion yuan ($9.67 billion) capital injection and began selling its assets. The two sources said that Dutch insurers Aegon and ASR were considered the most likely buyers for Vivat as a “deal of synergies” made more sense than a buyout.

-7.5603203516203115," JPMorgan picked to run sale of Anbang' Dutch insurer Vivat - sources * Anbang seen seeking price of up to $2 billion for Vivat * Consolidation seen as needed in Dutch insurance sector * Aegon, ASR among likely bidders AMSTERDAM, Sept 5 (Reuters) - China’s Anbang Insurance Group has picked JPMorgan to manage the 1.4-1.8 billion euro ($1.6-$2 billion) sale of its Dutch insurance arm Vivat, two people familiar with the matter told Reuters. The Chinese government has been considering the sale of Anbang’s overseas real estate and insurance assets, which include Belgian insurer Fidea, since it took control of the troubled company in February. JPMorgan won the mandate after Anbang asked banks to pitch for a role in August, the sources said. JPMorgan declined to comment. A Vivat spokesman referred questions to Anbang. Anbang could not immediately be reached for a response. A spokesman told Reuters in August it was reviewing the fate of its overseas holdings. UBS and China’s CICC have wider roles advising Anbang on its restructuring. Sources said they were not handling Vivat’s sale as Anbang wanted independent advice on its European disposals. Vivat on Wednesday reported a first-half underlying result of 115 million euros, with a Solvency II ratio of 167 percent and a book value of 3.35 billion euros. Two Dutch insurers, Aegon and ASR, have said they were aware Vivat was preparing a sale and would consider bidding. ASR could pay around 1.4 billion euros for Vivat, ABN Amro analyst Cor Kluis said in an email on Wednesday. Anbang bought Vivat -- the insurance arm of the defunct SNS Reaal, nationalized by the Dutch government in 2013 -- for a nominal 1 euro and a cash injection of 1.35 billion euros. But Anbang’s plans for foreign expansion have evaporated, and former chairman Wu Xiaohui was sentenced to 18 years in prison in May for charges including fraud. Beijing gave Anbang itself a 60.8 billion yuan ($9.67 billion) capital injection and began selling its assets. The two sources said that Dutch insurers Aegon and ASR were considered the most likely buyers for Vivat as a “deal of synergies” made more sense than a buyout. The Dutch central bank supports consolidation of the Dutch insurance industry, and last year quickly approved a takeover of Delta Lloyd by NN Group. Vivat’s operations include personal life insurer Reaal, corporate life and pension insurer Zwitserleven and investment arm Actiam, with more than 54 billion euros of assets under management.

-6.2258639985146695," Hesperia hires JP Morgan as adviser on NH Hoteles stake MADRID (Reuters) - Spanish hotel group Hesperia has hired JP Morgan to advise on options for its 8 percent stake in domestic peer NH Hoteles, currently the target of a takeover offer from Thai firm Minor International, two sources familiar with the matter said. The move from Hesperia, which has said Minor’s 6.3 euros per share offer for NH Hoteles was insufficient, comes as the Thai company nears majority control of NH with 45 percent of its share capital. Derailing Minor’s bid would be highly complicated at this stage. Spanish law dictates that a holder of more than 30 percent in any one company must launch a takeover offer, and the Thai firm is buying more NH shares every day. U.S. operator Hyatt Hotels moved toward a takeover battle for NH in July, but backed away just three days later after Minor revealed the size of its stake. One of the sources said JP Morgan, which advised China’s HNA Group on the sale of a 26.5 percent stake in NH to Minor in June, had approached other potential investors to try to muster a counter offer. “They realize it would be difficult, but they see some chance,” the source said. Minor’s offer put a value of up to 2.5 billion euros ($2.9 billion) on NH, which runs more than 370 hotels in 30 countries. The offer has been approved by Spanish and Portuguese competition watchdogs, but NH said the offer undervalued it. The mandate given by Hesperia to JP Morgan includes various options ranging from putting together a competing bid, to striking a partnership with Minor or simply selling the stake, the sources said. Hesperia and JP Morgan declined to comment. NH turned down a takeover in January from a different Spanish rival, Barcelo, which had valued it at 2.48 billion euros. ($1 = 0.8653 euros)"

-6.391674201419553," JPMorgan undercuts discount brokerages on trades NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co, JPM.N in a bid to lure customers from the discount brokerage industry, said on Tuesday it will begin offering free stock trades for self-managed accounts through its Chase mobile banking app starting next week. Shares of Charles Schwab Corp. SCHW.N and other discount brokerages fell after CNBC reported the offering was imminent. The service will be part of a new suite of investment products called “You Invest” through which customers will get at least 100 free trades of stocks and exchange-traded funds in their first year, a bank spokeswoman said on Tuesday. As part of the You Invest offering the bank also plans to launch online managed portfolios early next year, the spokeswoman said. The industry had been anticipating some sort of dramatic move by JPMorgan for several years. In April 2017 Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said in his annual letter that an “inexpensive” self-directed online tool was coming by the end of that year. He also has talked adding free services as part of a bigger consumer package, much like he has seen Amazon.com do with its Prime service. Still, the amount of price-cutting, coupled with the bank's widely-used app, makes the move by the biggest U.S. bank potentially disruptive to the discount brokerage industry pioneered by Charles Schwab Corp. SCHW.N “While this has been telegraphed for some time, JPM entering the discount brokerage market is not your typical bank given its size, scale and global brand,” equity analysts at Jefferies said in a note on Tuesday. Shares of Schwab were down 2.35 percent to $50.21 Tuesday afternoon, while shares of TD Ameritrade Holding Corp AMTD.O were down 7.53 percent to $55.62. E*Trade Financial Corp's ETFC.O stock was down more than 4.25 percent to $58.63. The move follows other disruptive actions by JPMorgan in what analysts have called a “scorched earth” strategy against competitors to take market share in profitable business across banking and finance--from credit cards to commercial lending to securities custody. The new investment services are being offered to so-called “mass affluent” customers with no minimum initial investment size, as well as to wealthier clients. After one year of free trades, the bank expects to add some charges, with pricing depending on the type of account. In comparison, Schwab currently charges $4.95 on stock trades while TD Ameritrade charges $6.95 per trade. JPMorgan’s new service will also compete with startups like Robinhood, an online brokerage which offers commission-free U.S. stocks and ETFs trading."
-6.587086733217015," JPMorgan extends Sapphire card brand to checking accounts NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N is expanding its high-end Sapphire brand to include checking accounts, hoping to attract and keep increasingly affluent millennial customers, the largest U.S. bank said on Wednesday. The bank is changing its Chase Premier Platinum accounts, which require a minimum of $75,000 in deposits and certain investments, into Sapphire Banking accounts, spokeswoman Elizabeth Seymour said. The new accounts will offer special access to sports and entertainment events as do its Sapphire Reserve credit cards. The Reserve card became a big hit with millennials eager to travel when it was introduced in 2016 with generous sign-up and spending bonuses and access to travel lounges. “We are focusing on customers who are starting to earn and save more,” Thasunda Duckett, chief executive of Chase Consumer Banking, said in an interview. “They are reaching key milestones.” The new bank accounts will also eliminate some of the fees that can annoy consumers, including those for wire transfers and foreign exchange at overseas ATMs. Later this year the bank will offer its Ultimate Rewards points, which it pays for credit card spending, as a sign-up incentive to new customers to Sapphire Banking accounts, Seymour said. The new account is another example of JPMorgan cutting prices and offering additional services to attract customers and take market share from competitors. On Tuesday the bank rattled the discount brokerage industry by offering free stock trades for self-managed accounts through its Chase mobile banking app. JPMorgan has also taken market share in securities lending with aggressive pricing. It has won commercial banking business by opening new offices in cities outside its established markets. The launch of the Sapphire Reserve card disrupted the high-end credit card business and resulted in higher-than-expected start-up expenses for JPMorgan. JPMorgan has previously used tie-ins with Sapphire Reserve to promote its mortgage loans. Duckett said the bank is working on other extensions of Sapphire in consumer banking. “We are just getting started. You can expect us to continue to iterate,” she said. The bank aims to grow consumer deposits more quickly than the industry. Low-cost deposits become more valuable to banks as interest rates rise on loans. Duckett said offering higher interest rates on accounts is not the key to attracting customers. “They value more than just interest rates,” she said."

-4.7204165346413," Tesla nears three-month low as JPMorgan adds to deal doubts (Reuters) - Tesla Inc TSLA.O shares fell nearly 4 percent on Monday as a $113 cut in JPMorgan Chase's JPM.N price target for the electric carmaker added to growing doubts among market players about a plan to take the company private. Slashing its price target for Tesla Inc TSLA.O from $308 to $195, the brokerage said it did not believe Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk had funds for a plan announced by a tweet that said ""funding secured"" two weeks ago. Analysts from the U.S. bank had upped its forecast from $198 to $308 after a roughly $100 surge in Tesla stock following Musk’s tweets on Aug. 7 and the note on Monday was the latest evidence of scepticism about the deal on Wall Street. People familiar with the matter said on Sunday that PIF, the Saudi Arabian sovereign wealth fund that Musk says had been pressing to help fund the buyout, is in talks to invest in aspiring Tesla rival Lucid Motors Inc. “Our interpretation of subsequent events leads us to believe that funding was not secured for a going private transaction, nor was there any formal proposal,” JPMorgan analyst Ryan Brinkman wrote in a client note. “Tesla does appear to be exploring a going private transaction, but we now believe that such a process appears much less developed than we had earlier presumed, suggesting formal incorporation into our valuation analysis seems premature at this time,” Brinkman said. JPM now targets the stock, which it continues to value at underweight, back at $195, versus Friday’s close of $305.50. The median price target of the Wall Street analysts covering Tesla is $336. Tesla shares touched a three-month low of $285 in premarket trading before recovering to trade around $290, reducing its market value back below that of General Motors GM.N as the biggest U.S. carmaker. An interview with the New York Times, in which Musk said he was under major emotional stress in the “most difficult year” of his life, on Friday added to investors’ concerns over his leadership after a series of social media spats. A person with direct knowledge of the matter told Reuters last week that the SEC has opened an inquiry related to Musk’s tweets on the buyout and the billionaire is also facing a class action suite from investors who lost money in the share moves. “The lack of process to (Musk’s) announcement has now caused governance and competency concerns which are starting to snowball,” said Tigress Financial Partners analyst Ivan Feinseth."

A Goldman Sachs representative confirmed the contents of the memo. A JP Morgan representative confirmed the departure. A move to a rival firm for a banker as senior as Simon, who was JP Morgan’s global chairman of mergers and acquisitions, is rare and underscores Goldman Sachs’ drive to be No. 1 in the global M&A league tables. It is currently second in the rankings that measure market share in M&A advisory business, behind Morgan Stanley, and has worked on $846.7 billion of global deals so far this year, according to Thomson Reuters data. It holds the No. 1 ranking in deals that have U.S. involvement, the data shows. JP Morgan, which ranks third in both global and U.S. M&A according to the Thomson Reuters data, said last month its M&A fees reached a record $1.2 billion in the first half of the year. “Kurt brings a wealth of knowledge, experience, and valuable insights to our business and his appointment underscores our continued commitment to further strengthening and developing our global team,” Goldman Sachs’ senior leaders in its banking division - Gregg Lemkau, John Waldron and Marc Nachmann - said in the memo. Simon will also become a co-chairman in the global technology, media and telecom group based in New York. At JP Morgan, he advised its largest clients such as Walt Disney Co , Dell Technologies Inc and Softbank Group . Simon was also based in San Francisco from 2010 until 2015. A J.P. Morgan spokesman said the bank did not plan on finding a replacement for Simon as global M&A chairman, “given the depth of talent in the bank’s M&A and Technology, Media and Telecom teams.” He also noted that “many of the M&A transactions have been spearheaded by Jamie Dimon, the bank’s CEO.” Transformative tie-ups of telecommunications and media companies, including megadeals such as the sale of most of the assets from Rupert Murdoch’s Twenty-First Century Fox Inc to Disney, and the combination of Sprint Corp and T-Mobile US Inc, have been boosting worldwide merger and acquisition activity to new highs. In the first half of the year, announced deals in global media M&A totaled $322.5 billion, more than six times as high as the same period a year ago. (Reporting by Liana B.

-4.115891489225235," JPMorgan Chase revamps entry-level tech program in race for talent NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N has revamped its entry-level program for technologists to attract more young software engineers amid a battle for top talent between Wall Street and Silicon Valley. The bank has adapted the two-year curriculum to focus on technical skills and will provide recruits hands-on experience on more challenging projects, Lori Beer, JPMorgan’s global chief information officer, told Reuters on Thursday. The new hires will also be given technical assessments and training and will be assigned to managers who act as career advisers, she added. “We wanted to take a fresh look not only at how other financial services firms think about talent but also, other high tech companies,” Beer said. “We have fantastic talent but we need a lot of it.” JPMorgan, which is the largest U.S. bank by assets, brings in about 1,000 entry-level engineers each year globally. Cyber security, cloud technology and data science engineers, are especially in demand, according to Beer. Similar to other large banks, the company has been facing intensifying competition for the best software developers and engineers from large technology firms and hedge funds which are seen as having better perks and work hours. The bank now refers to staff under the program as software engineers rather than technology analysts, bringing the terminology in line with that used by big tech companies. Goldman Sachs Group GS.N, which also calls its technology employees engineers, last year relaxed its dress code for their division in a bid to boost appeal. At JPMorgan, the dress code was relaxed two years ago, and some offices for tech staff include foosball tables, scooters, video games and guitars, features largely associated with tech firms. While the growing use of digital technologies has led to a spike in demand for developers across industries, banks have traditionally been big tech recruiters and spenders. JPMorgan employs 50,000 technologists globally, about two-thirds of them software engineers, up from 40,000 in 2016. It is set to spend $10.8 billion on technology this year, compared to a $9 billion tech budget in 2016. The bank has 48 million active digital customers, up 14 percent from 2016 and processes $5 trillion in payments a day."
-5.115716705579784," JPMorgan says it is a subject of SEC probe of ADR abuses NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N said on Wednesday it is among banks and securities dealers being investigated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission for their handling of so-called ""pre-released"" American Depositary Receipts (ADR) between 2011 and 2015. The disclosure, made in a regular quarterly filing by JPMorgan, comes after the SEC said on July 20 that Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE had agreed to pay nearly $75 million to settle its part of a continuing investigation into mishandling of the securities. ADRs are U.S. securities that represent foreign shares of a foreign company. They require a corresponding number of foreign shares to be held in custody at a depositary bank. Under certain conditions the SEC allows the “pre-release” of ADRs before the corresponding shares have been deposited. In the case of Deutsche, the SEC said the bank had improperly provided thousands of pre-released ADRs and failed to prevent securities law violations when the instruments were borrowed or lent. Failures to properly handle the transactions leave ADRs “ripe for potential abuse at the expense of ADR holders,” the SEC said when it settled with Deutsche. JPMorgan said it has been cooperating with the investigation. A spokesman declined to comment further."

Aramco aims to buy such a stake, possibly taking the entire 70 percent holding owned by Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund, two of the sources familiar with the matter told Reuters earlier on Monday. Late last week, Aramco IPO-ARMO.SE confirmed a Reuters report that it was working on the possible purchase of a ""strategic stake"" in Saudi Basic Industries Corp (SABIC) 2010.SE from the Public Investment Fund (PIF), Saudi Arabia's top sovereign wealth fund. Aramco wants to develop its downstream business as the government prepares to sell up to 5 percent of the company, which is the world’s largest oil producer. Boosting its petrochemicals portfolio further could help to attract investors for the initial public offering. JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley had already been among the advisers assisting Aramco on its IPO. Aramco’s initial thinking is to buy the full stake owned by the PIF, but if that fails to materialise Aramco could end up with a stake in SABIC of more than 50 percent, making it a majority owner, two of the sources said. No final decision has been made on the size of the stake as discussions are at a very early stage, they added. Aramco, JPMorgan and Morgan Stanley declined to comment. The PIF did not respond to a request for comment on the size of the stake sale. Riyadh-listed SABIC, the world’s fourth-biggest petrochemicals company, has a market capitalisation of 385.2 billion Saudi riyals ($103 billion). The potential acquisition would affect the time frame of Aramco’s planned IPO set for later this year, the state oil giant’s chief executive, Amin Nasser, said in a TV interview on Friday. Aramco plans to boost investments in refining and petrochemicals to secure new markets and sees growth in chemicals as central to its downstream strategy to cut the risk of an oil demand slowdown. [L8N1TE423] Aramco plans to raise its refining capacity to between 8 million and 10 million barrels per day, from around 5 million bpd now, and double its petrochemicals production by 2030.

0.08969371781860935," JPMorgan Chase invests in artificial intelligence startup Volley NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N has made a strategic investment in Volley.com, a San Francisco-based startup that uses artificial intelligence to help large enterprises automatically generate training content for employees, the companies said on Tuesday. The companies declined to disclose the size of the investment, but Volley said it will use the funding to double its team of less than 20 over the next nine months. JPMorgan’s investment comes as banks increasingly look to use artificial intelligence to make better use of the growing amount of data that they hold across a variety of business lines, ranging from trading to compliance. The startup is developing software that can process data from disparate sources to create quizzes and other corporate training material such as cyber security or compliance courses. Its technology can help large companies, including banks, save money and time when creating educational content for employees, Volley founder and chief technology officer Carson Kahn said in an interview. Volley had initially focused on developing an app for students that used its machine learning engine, but later pivoted to developing technology for enterprises, Kahn added. New York-based JPMorgan takes equity stakes in young technology companies that can help the bank enhance customer experience, become more efficient and protect its assets. “Volley’s innovative technology to ingest, integrate and target micro-learning content automatically can fundamentally transform the way firms like ours approach learning and knowledge management,” Joseph Infozino, head of learning platforms at JPMorgan Chase, said in a statement. Volley's investors also include Zuckerberg Education Ventures, a fund investing on behalf of Facebook Inc FB.O founder Mark Zuckerberg, as well as former global co-heads of technology at Goldman Sachs Group Inc GS.N Paul Walker and Don Duet. Walker, also a senior advisor at Volley, said in an interview that the company’s technology could help augment people’s ability to learn by identifying their knowledge gaps and creating personalized content. “Volley is tackling and solving one of the most difficult and important problems in machine learning: extracting knowledge from unstructured information,” Walker said."
1.2588728791671908," JPMorgan profit beats on better-than-expected trading, loan growth (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co's JPM.N quarterly profit topped Wall Street's expectations on Friday, as trading revenue came in much higher than expected and demand for loans increased on the back of a strengthening U.S. economy. U.S. banks are benefiting from a cut in corporate tax rates, hikes in interest rates and a growing economy that is driving demand from borrowers while holding down loan loss rates. “We see good global economic growth, particularly in the U.S., where consumer and business sentiment is high,” Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said. Overall, the bank’s revenue rose 6.5 percent to $28.39 billion and topped the average analyst estimate of $27.36 billion, driven by growth in all four of the bank’s businesses. Shares of the largest U.S. bank by assets were up 1 percent in premarket trading. JPMorgan’s quarterly reports are closely watched for signs about the health of consumers and businesses as the lender plays a major role in several businesses, such as home mortgages, commercial lending and asset management. Average core loans, which include consumer credit and loans to the biggest corporations, were up 7 percent compared with the year-earlier quarter. Analysts and economists are watching loan demand at banks for signs of any impact from international trade tariffs on their business and expansion plans. Investors have also been looking for signs that the corporate tax cuts have given companies new confidence to borrow, a phenomenon that bankers have said might not show up before the second half of the year. Earlier this week, Dimon was quoted in an Italian newspaper saying that U.S. business executives have warned U.S. President Donald Trump that the impact of trade tariffs on economic growth could offset the benefits of tax cuts. Trading revenue, which makes up about a fifth of JPMorgan’s total revenue, was up 13 percent, compared with a 1 percent gain expected by Credit Suisse analyst Susan Roth Katzke. In May, the bank’s corporate and investment bank chief, Daniel Pinto, said second-quarter markets revenue was likely to be flat compared with a year earlier. Net interest income rose 10 percent as the U.S. Federal Reserve raised benchmark interest rates four times since the second quarter of 2017. Net income rose 18.3 percent to $8.32 billion, or $2.29 per share, in the second quarter ended June 30, from $7.03 billion, or $1.82 per share, a year earlier.

In the interview he also expressed concerns about the effects of Brexit and trade tariffs. “I think that Brexit will ultimately have very heavy consequences for the British people and for growth in Britain ...and the lower growth in Britain will negatively affect global growth, so Brexit will damage almost everyone,” Dimon said.

10.91933951959632," German government, JPMorgan deny report on Deutsche Bank FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The German government dismissed a report that it had privately raised concerns about Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE, while JPMorgan JPM.N denied it was interested in a stake in Germany's biggest lender. Shares in Deutsche had jumped by as much as 6 percent on Friday after WirtschaftsWoche (WiWo) magazine said JPMorgan and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) 601398.SS might invest in the bank. By 1055 GMT, its shares had retraced some of those gains but were still up 4.8 percent at 9.98 euros . The weekly publication had also said Chancellor Angela Merkel met Axel Weber, the former Bundesbank head who is now chairman of Swiss bank UBS UBSG.S, to sound out his views on Deutsche. “We were astonished to learn about the report about a supposed conversation between the chancellor and Mr Weber,” government spokesman Steffen Seibert told a news conference. “It is purely speculative and cannot be confirmed.” The government had full trust in the bank’s management, he added. A spokeswoman for JPMorgan said: “We are denying the story, it is not true.” UBS and Deutsche Bank declined to comment and ICBC could not immediately be reached for comment. Shares in Germany’s flagship bank touched record lows below 9 euros in June on investor scepticism about the appointment of Christian Sewing as CEO and his strategy to refocus on its European core while slashing global investment banking. Some investors have said they doubt whether Sewing, 48, can return Deutsche to profitability after the bank racked up three years of losses under his predecessor, John Cryan. He has been hobbled by downgrades to Deutsche’s credit ratings, while the bank’s U.S. subsidiary has failed a Federal Reserve test of its ability to withstand a financial crisis. Despite Deutsche’s woes, its franchise was attracting interest as London’s standing as a financial center is threatened by Britain’s looming exit from the European Union, investment bankers told WirtschaftsWoche. Bulge-bracket banks are looking to strengthen their presence in Frankfurt, as the German financial capital and seat of the European Central Bank gains importance after Brexit. Deutsche’s shares have fallen by nearly two fifths this year, reducing its market capitalization to below 20 billion euros ($23.4 billion). That compares to JPMorgan’s $353 billion and ICBC’s $274 billion."

10.91933951959632," Exclusive: JPMorgan triggers EU talent transfer as 'dozens' prepare for Brexit move LONDON (Reuters) - JPMorgan JPM.N has asked ""several dozen"" employees to lead a first wave of relocations from Britain to continental Europe by early 2019, kicking off plans to protect its business post-Brexit, a memo to staff shows. In its first Brexit-related mass communication to its 16,000-strong workforce in the UK this year, JPMorgan highlights the organisational and strategic challenges facing global banks as they prepare for Britain’s European Union exit. It comes a day before Prime Minister Theresa May is due to host crunch talks with ministers at her country residence Chequers on how she wants to shape Britain’s future trading relationship with the soon-to-be 27-member club. Signed by Daniel Pinto, chief executive of JPMorgan’s Corporate & Investment Bank and Mary Erdoes, chief executive of the bank’s Asset & Wealth Management division, Thursday’s email also outlined JPMorgan’s plans to beef up its presence in other EU cities including Paris, Madrid and Milan. Until now, the Wall Street heavyweight was broadly expected to focus on expanding its Frankfurt, Luxembourg and Dublin bases, where it already holds banking licenses. A spokesman for JPMorgan confirmed the authenticity of the memo, which was also sent to its staff in continental Europe, Middle East and Africa, but declined to comment further. The staff who have committed to leave Britain before “Brexit Day” on March 29, 2019 primarily work in client-facing or risk management roles in both the investment bank and asset management divisions. The memo also said JPMorgan expected to migrate or add “a few hundred roles” to the EU-based headcount by that date and it had already started recruiting for key positions, but relocations could happen more gradually if a suitable transition deal was confirmed. The total size of its EU workforce, however, “was entirely dependent on whether an agreed transition arrangement is finally confirmed.” “Just as we are working to minimize disruption for our clients, we are looking to do the same for our people,” the memo said. “We want to avoid affecting the lives of employees and their families with changes that could prove to be unnecessary or premature, as long as political negotiations and regulatory outcomes remain unclear.” Slow progress in post-Brexit negotiations with Brussels has raised fears of a so-called “hard Brexit” that would cause major disruption to global banks who run their European businesses from Britain, home to a thriving financial services industry and hubs for bond, equity and currency trading. With an October deadline on the trading relationship between Britain and the EU just weeks away, banks have little idea how many EU staff they will need to maintain relationships with EU-based governments, companies and investors. About 5,000 finance jobs will be shifted out of Britain or created overseas in the next few years if it is denied access to Europe’s single market, half the original forecast, a Reuters survey in March found. Shortly before the June 2016 referendum, JPMorgan chief executive Jamie Dimon suggested the bank could move thousands of jobs out of London if Brexit talks failed to deliver a good outcome for the financial services sector. But a letter sent to shareholders in April showed the bank’s leadership remains open-minded about the impact on its operations, with a much larger number of job relocations seen just as possible as staying “exactly as we are today”. “What we do not know — and will not know until the negotiations are complete — is what the end state will look like,” Dimon’s letter said."

JPMorgan’s plan for China investment banking expansion comes as a slew of Chinese technology companies, or so-called unicorns, have raised or are planning to raise billions of dollars through public and private markets."
10.285191445155684," JP Morgan consults on including Gulf states in key bond index LONDON (Reuters) - JP Morgan has started a consultation on including Gulf states in its widely tracked emerging market government bond indexes, although a number of issues remain sticking points. JP Morgan’s EMBI bond index is a key performance benchmark for emerging market investors. Inclusion in the index can encourage hundreds of billions of dollars of buying of that country’s bonds, lowering its borrowing costs. Slides produced as part of the bank’s annual index “governance consultation” first looked at various metrics for Gulf states, whose relatively high incomes don’t always fit the standard definition of an “emerging” market. Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries - Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman and Qatar - have issued a quarter of all new debt sold by emerging markets in each of the last three years. They now account for 14 percent of total EM debt stock. A spokesman for the bank declined to comment on the likelihood of Gulf countries getting the green light in the next update of the index, which normally gets announced around September. A source at the bank told Reuters that its “indices work to strict rules of eligibility and this rumored scenario with GCC countries (gaining inclusion) may never come to pass”. The presentation showed how GCC countries are too high on the World Bank High Income classification (IIC) index to meet normal emerging market index eligibility. However, there could be other ways to look at it, such as purchasing power parity ratios that the IMF and OECD use to compare different countries’ wealth. That would class GCC countries firmly as emerging markets. Analysts and investors were beginning to run the numbers on what inclusion would mean in terms of bond buying. According to JP Morgan’s estimates, about $360 billion track its hard-currency emerging market debt indexes. About $150 billion of debt from GCC may get added with an expected weight of 12.33 percent. A phase-in could happen at 2 percent a month for six months. “This could lead to passive inflows of over $45 billion, which will be about 30 percent of total amount outstanding of the bonds to be added,” said Abhishek Kumar, the managing director for emerging markets debt and fixed income beta at State Street Global Advisers. Dino Kronfol, chief investment officer for global sukuk and MENA fixed-income strategies at Franklin Templeton said it would be a “tremendous development and very positive for the region, particularly efforts to develop regional capital markets.” Assessing the situation in China, the JP Morgan consultation acknowledged that significant progress had been made in opening the country’s bond markets to foreign investors since 2016. “We continue to observe key action items to determine GBI-EM Global Diversified eligibility,” JP Morgan wrote in the presentation slides, referring to the bank’s local sovereign debt benchmark. Adding only the more readily traded or “liquid” Chinese government bonds could result in an estimated weight of 7 percent in the bank’s flagship GBI-EM Global Diversified index. China has $800 billion of bonds represented in the GBI-EM Broad index, but the replicability of these bonds remained unclear, JP Morgan added. Just over $230 billion of assets under management are benchmarked against its local debt indexes, of which $211 billion are benchmarked again the GBI-EM Global Diversified index, the bank said."

1.2054812350639754," JPMorgan poaches Wells Fargo banker for entertainment group - sources (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N has hired Reginald Lang, the head of media investment banking at Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N, to work for its entertainment industries group, which provides financing to TV and film studios, people familiar with the matter said. The group, which is part of JPMorgan’s commercial banking arm, does not finance individual TV and movie projects. Instead, it provides corporate financing that producers can use to fund budgets, refinance debt or splash out on mergers and acquisitions. Lang, a managing director in Wells Fargo’s New York office, will relocate to Los Angeles and report to the head of JPMorgan’s entertainment industries group, David Shaheen, the sources said, requesting anonymity to discuss the matter ahead of an official announcement. JPMorgan could announce the new hire as early as Monday in an internal memo, according to one of the sources. JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Lang all declined to comment. The move marks a return to JPMorgan for Lang, who left the New York-based bank in 2006 to join Wachovia, a bank subsequently acquired by Wells Fargo, according to his LinkedIn page. JPMorgan has a market share of more than 90 percent in the provision of senior debt financing to entertainment production companies, according to its website. It started financing Hollywood movies in the silent film era of the 1920s. JPMorgan's corporate clients in the entertainment industry include Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios Inc, Lions Gate Entertainment Corp LGFa.N, Legendary Pictures, which is now owned by China's Dalian Wanda, Steven Spielberg's Amblin Partners, Village Roadshow Ltd and Entertainment One Ltd ETO.L."
1.2054812350639754," JPMorgan applies to set up majority-owned securities business in China HONG KONG (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N said on Monday it has applied to China's securities regulator to set up a securities business in which the U.S. bank would own a majority stake under recently relaxed ownership rules. The unit, in which JPMorgan would own 51 percent, would allow the firm’s corporate and investment banking divisions to seek more Chinese clients on the mainland in an effort to expand and grow their businesses, JPMorgan said in a statement. The U.S. bank also said it is looking to double its research coverage of China-listed companies across all sectors, and that it has appointed banking veteran Mark Leung as chief executive of its China business. The application is a step toward JPMorgan’s return to the securities business in China, having sold its 33 percent holding in a similar venture to its local partner in 2016. JPMorgan did not disclose who would own the remaining 49 percent of the new venture. However, it said it would raise its ownership to 100 percent if eventually permitted. China in April said it aims to raise foreign ownership limits in securities, fund management and futures firms to 51 percent. The announcement came as the United States and other trading partners complain of unfair limits on competition. “These developments are important for China, the U.S. and global commerce, and an encouraging sign for the world’s two largest economies,” JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said in the statement. In the past, Western banks could only own up to 49 percent of Chinese securities joint ventures. The lack of control and limited contribution to revenue have long been a source of frustration. JPMorgan joins other foreign banks including Nomura Holdings Inc 8604.T and UBS Group AG UBSG.S who have taken steps in China to set up majority-owned securities businesses, which typically provide broking and underwriting services. So far, only HSBC Holdings PLC HSBA.L has received permission to set up a majority-owned securities joint venture in China, taking advantage of rules that favor Hong Kong-established banks over foreign peers. JPMorgan also said its asset and wealth management unit is also working on increasing its current Chinese joint venture stake to a majority interest, subject to agreement with its joint venture partner and the relevant authorities."

7.667953015492728," Activist investment rising in Asia, led by local players: JP Morgan HONG KONG (Reuters) - Activist investing in Asia is rising steadily, driven more by local players rather than headline-grabbing foreign firms, as the region's regulators pay greater attention to corporate governance, according to research from JP Morgan JPM.N. Last year, there were 106 activist campaigns in Asia, versus 94 the previous year and just 10 in 2011, the investment bank said, citing data from Activist Investor and Shark Repellent. Domestic players accounted for almost two-thirds of activist campaigns between 2011 and 2017, JP Morgan said. “In Asia, as regulators look to protect the interests of minority shareholders, corporate governance has risen up the agenda ... activist investors now have more power to push for change in the companies in which they have invested,” said David Hunker, JP Morgan’s head of shareholder activism defense. In Japan, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has been a public advocate of corporate governance, providing a boost to activists. Earlier this year, Sparx Asset Management 8739.T urged synthetic fiber maker Teikoku Sen-i 3302.T to triple dividend payouts. The proposal was rejected, but the company separately announced a small increase in dividend, for which Shuhei Abe, founder and CEO of Sparx, claimed some credit. Similar trends are emerging in other parts of Asia. Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing 0388.HK finalised new rules recently for capital raisings by listed issuers aimed at ""restricting abusive practices ... and protecting the interests of minority shareholders"". South Korea’s Financial Services Commission has also announced a plan to facilitate and encourage minority shareholder participation at meetings for listed companies. Another factor in the rise of shareholder activism is the growing presence of large global institutional investors among Asian listed companies’ top shareholders, Hunker said. These investors have already shown a willingness to support activist investors, if not in Asia, then at least elsewhere in the world, he said, adding that such firms are certainly willing to disagree with management decisions. U.S. activist fund Elliott Management has challenged South Korea's top two family-run conglomerates, most recently Hyundai Motor 005380.KS, over better corporate governance and returns to shareholders. BlackRock said in its Asia Pacific investment stewardship report for the fourth quarter of last year that of the 8,390 proposals it had voted on in the three months, it had voted against management recommendations on 7 percent of them."

6.90248508815698," Investors least bearish on longer-dated U.S. bonds since Sept -JPMorgan May 1 (Reuters) - The margin of investors who are bearish on longer-dated U.S. Treasuries versus those who are bullish on them shrank to its slimmest since September, JPMorgan Chase & Co’s latest client survey showed on Tuesday. The move came after benchmark 10-year Treasury yields last week reached 3 percent for the first time since January 2014 on concerns about rising inflation and government borrowing. The 10-year yield retreated below 3 percent on buying from investors attracted to those yield levels. At 10:35 a.m. (1435 GMT), the 10-year Treasury yield was 2.976 percent, up 4 basis points from late on Monday. The share of investors who said on Monday they were “short,” or holding fewer Treasuries than their portfolio benchmarks, decreased to 28 percent from 36 percent a week earlier. The share of investors who said they were “long” longer-dated Treasuries slipped to 19 percent from 21 percent the prior week. The net shorts fell to 9 percent from 15 percent last week, marking the smallest difference between the shares of short and long investors since Sept. 18, JPMorgan said. The share of investors who said they were neutral on longer-dated government debt grew to 53 percent from 43 percent, JPMorgan said.

The listing in London or Hong Kong could be the first in a string of sales from a privatization program in Central Asia’s biggest economy. Kazakhtelecom, which already trades on the Almaty bourse, will also be listed on the new Astana exchange. Oil-rich Kazakhstan launched its privatization drive with the goal of reducing the state’s role in the economy by 2021. VTB and JP Morgan declined to comment. The Kazakh sovereign wealth fund Samruk-Kazyna, which owns 52 percent of the firm, and Kazakhtelecom did not respond to requests for comment. One source said he expected the Astana bourse, which is due to open in July, to be the “driving force” for the new listing. Kazakhtelecom, which Thomson Reuters data shows has a market capitalization of 309.7 billion tenge ($944.32 million), has a 51 percent stake in a local mobile operator co-owned by Tele2 and made a bid for Kcell KCEL.KZ, another Kazakh mobile firm. Separately, two banking sources said Kazakhstan's state uranium miner Kazatomprom had delayed its plans to list in London this year due to falling uranium prices UX-U3O8-SPT, used to power nuclear reactors. In 2017, Kazatomprom hired JP Morgan as its lead adviser on the flotation. Samruk-Kazyna, which has holdings worth $67 billion, plans to reduce its investments in Air Astana, Kazatomprom, oil company KazMunayGaz (KMG) and other assets."
0.37205160271529764," RPT-JPMorgan, National Bank of Canada, others test debt issuance on blockchain (Repeats story with no changes) NEW YORK, April 20 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase & Co has tested a new blockchain platform for issuing financial instruments with the National Bank of Canada and other large firms, they said on Friday, seeking to streamline origination, settlement, interest rate payments and other processes. The test on Wednesday mirrored the Canadian bank’s $150 million offering on the same day of a one-year floating-rate Yankee certificate of deposit, they said in a statement. The platform was built over more than a year using Quorum, a type of open-source blockchain that JPMorgan has developed inhouse and is in discussions to spin off. Participants in the experiment included Goldman Sachs Asset Management, the fund management arm of Goldman Sachs Group Inc , Pfizer Inc and Legg Mason Inc’s Western Asset and other investors in the certificate of deposit. Banks have poured millions of dollars to develop blockchain, the software first created to run cryptocurrency bitcoin, to streamline processes ranging from cross-border payments to securities settlement. “Blockchain-related technologies have the potential to bring about major change in the financial services industry,” David Furlong, senior vice president of artificial intelligence, venture capital and blockchain at National Bank of Canada, said in a statement.
