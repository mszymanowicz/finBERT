2.4798596484787874," U.S. Treasury's Yellen vows to boost transatlantic cooperation WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen stressed the importance of cooperation with the European Union in a call with the European Commission’s vice president for the economy, Valdis Dombrovskis, on Tuesday, the U.S. Treasury Department said. Earlier on Tuesday, Yellen in a conversation with European Central Bank President Christine Lagarde had also underscored ways to deepen transatlantic cooperation on economic and financial issues. In her discussion with the EU executive, Yellen emphasized the importance of the transatlantic partnership and said she aimed to work more closely with Brussels on key challenges, including “ending the pandemic, supporting a strong global economic recovery, fighting income inequality, and forcefully addressing the threat of climate change,” the Treasury said. Yellen committed to re-engaging in discussions on international taxation to forge a timely international accord, and to seek solutions to key bilateral trade issues, it said. The Biden administration is seeking to rebuild ties with European allies on all fronts after the deep rifts that characterized Donald Trump’s presidency, and want to work together to counter what Yellen has called China’s “abusive, unfair and illegal practices.” While Trump, a Republican, repeatedly took aim at European allies, threatening and imposing tariffs on a range of goods, the administration of Democratic President Joe Biden has sent far more positive signals on issues ranging from trade to taxes. EU officials last week welcomed Washington’s decision to refrain from imposing additional tariffs on EU goods in a long-running dispute over aircraft tariffs, and said they were ready to work to resolve trade disputes. The United States and European countries have also said they will redouble efforts to reenergize and conclude talks on global taxation being led by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Nearly 140 countries are negotiating the first update in a generation to the rules for taxing cross-border commerce, to account for the emergence of big tech companies like Alphabet Inc’s Google, Apple Inc and Facebook Inc. The talks stalled under the Trump administration after Yellen’s predecessor suspended U.S. involvement, but OECD ministers say they now hope to reach a deal by mid-2021."

2.395508796456846," Exclusive: Vietnam intervened in currency markets weeks after U.S. censure: sources HANOI/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - After being branded a “currency manipulator” by the United States in December for trying to keep the dong from rising in value, Vietnam is again intervening in foreign exchange markets and using what traders say is an unusual method to do so, according to six people familiar with the matter and a review of an interbank trading message. Early in January, the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) told some local banks it would cease its regular purchase of U.S. dollars in the spot market, where the trade settles within days, according to two senior currency traders and an analyst, who all work at local banks and have direct involvement in the trades. The central bank offered the local banks an attractive deal instead: It would agree to buy dollars at a favourable rate for delivery in July, and it would allow the local banks to cancel this agreement before mid-June if they wished, according to the three sources and a review of trading instructions sent by the SBV for one such transaction. The new method of intervention, which has not been previously reported, put downward pressure on the dong but without money changing hands right away, which the sources said could help avoid drawing U.S. attention to the trades and any further consequences for bilateral relations. For a graphic, click tmsnrt.rs/3aT8V0K The SBV did not respond to requests for comment. There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing by Vietnam. Many central banks intervene regularly in currency markets. Vietnam has consistently said its currency policies aimed to maintain stability and control inflation, not seek trade advantage. “We do not have anything public to share at this time,” a Treasury official said in an emailed response to Reuters’ queries about Vietnam’s foreign exchange practices. Vietnam, which has seen a surge in export-led growth as manufacturing of electronics and other goods, has increasingly shifted to the Southeast Asian nation, especially from China after its trade war with Washington. A higher value of the dong because of its trade surplus could hurt this growth in the middle of a pandemic. Nguyen Xuan Binh, who is head of research at KB Securities in Hanoi and familiar with the trades but not directly involved with them, said the delayed delivery of dollars meant Vietnam’s central bank could avoid triggering one of the conditions behind the U.S. label: buying dollars in six of 12 consecutive months. The Treasury’s semi-annual report to Congress, which examines exchange rate policies of major trading partners, said in December that Vietnam’s currency management was aimed at creating “unfair competitive advantage in international trade.” It said Vietnam met all the conditions that trigger the currency manipulator designation, including “persistent, one-sided intervention” in the currency market. The stakes are high for Vietnam since further interventions after the currency manipulator label could trigger a U.S. response, such as new tariffs on its goods. The next U.S. review is slated for April. Under its January deals, the SBV offered the local banks an above-market rate of 23,125 dong per dollar, according to the three sources and written trading messages sent by the central bank. That rate is a premium of about 0.5% on current spot prices. If the dong were to rise further between January and June, it would increase the premium over spot prices for the banks. And if the dong were to weaken below 23,125, they could then cancel the deal and sell dollars in the spot market instead. Reuters could not determine the size of the SBV’s intervention, but the three traders said it was large enough to create demand for dollars in the market, which put downward pressure on the dong. The currency’s value in the black market, where the dong is often traded in the real economy, has fallen 1.1% as the traders said dollar supply may have dried up. SBV’s new transactions resemble financial derivatives known as forwards, which bind parties to exchange currencies at a future date at an agreed upon rate, the three sources said. Forwards contracts offer several advantages to central banks. They do not require cash up-front and can help smooth out sudden shifts in reserves. Indeed, they are popular with other Asian central banks, such as those in India, Taiwan and South Korea. But four of the people familiar with the transactions said SBV’s agreements were not typical forward contracts, as they gave banks the option to cancel the deal without significant costs. Two of them said the SBV had offered similar options previously, around 2015, although then it had been selling dollar forwards in order to try and support a sliding value of the dong. As the SBV previously preferred to use three-month forward contracts, all six sources familiar with the transactions said the shift to a longer time frame suggested a desire to buy time before the intervention drew U.S. attention or pressure. The SBV did not respond to questions about its approach."
2.8099361923709805," U.S. 10-yr yield rises to 1.2%, inflation expectations build LONDON (Reuters) - A U.S. Treasury selloff gathered pace on Monday, with 10-year yields rising to 1.20% and inflation expectations at the highest since 2014 as investors priced an acceleration in economic recovery thanks to President Joe Biden’s spending package. The $1.9 trillion stimulus package looks likely to be approved by Congress, bypassing Republican roadblocks. Friday’s lacklustre labour data appeared to highlight the urgency of getting state support to the economy. Ten-year borrowing costs extended their rise to the highest since last March at 1.2%, while 30-year yields touched 2% for the first time since mid-February 2020. Ten-year yields are up around 30 bps since end-2020. Rabobank analysts said the catalyst appeared to be Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen’s comments “where she cited her expectation that, with sufficient fiscal support, the U.S. should be at full employment in 2022”. The Treasury curve steepened further, with the gap between 2- and 10-year yields now at its widest since early-2017 at around 108.4 bps. The 5-year/30-year Treasury yield gap widened to around 151.50 bps, a new October 2015 high. Inflation expectations have been steadily rising in recent weeks and on Monday, 10-year breakeven inflation rate rose briefly above 2.20%, the highest since 2014. Investors will be closely watching inflation data due on Wednesday. Prices had increased 0.4% in December. “Inflation is becoming a prominent theme with a growing suspicion that its rise could be larger and longer-lasting than the Fed currently anticipating,” ING Bank told clients. The moves haven’t yet spooked global equity markets which hit a record high on Monday."

World shares are a tad lower but within striking distance of last month’s record peak and on track for their strongest week in three months. Positive soundings from the earning season, Italy tapping former ECB chief Draghi to solve its political crisis, hopes for big-time U.S. stimulus and bullish comments by Fed policymakers on economic growth are all lending a new impetus to reflation trades. Ten-year U.S. Treasury yields set a new three-week high at 1.151% and Brent crude is at an 11-month peak. In Europe, despite a double-dip recession, German 10-year yields are approaching six-month high. In a sign of confidence, Shell boosted its dividend even as Q4 profits dropped to the lowest in over two decades, boosting shares almost 1% pre-market. Deutsche Bank meanwhile posted its first annual net profit since 2014, sending shares nearly 4% higher before the bell. On the radar is also the Bank of England. No policy changes are expected but it will likely set its sight on the prospects of an vaccine-driven economic recovery and release the findings of a consultation on what negative rates would mean for banks. One dampener: speculation China may want to tighten its policy drove short-term rates higher. Also watch the dollar -- at its strongest in more than two months on signs U.S. economic recovery is outpacing the rest of the developed world. Key developments that should provide more direction to markets on Thursday: * Unilever reported underlying sales growth for the fourth quarter that was in line with estimates * Roche got a fourth-quarter lift from its COVID-19 test business * Nokia reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter revenue and underlying profits, buoyed by a strategy revamp. * Frankfurt-listed shares in retail trader darlings GameStop and AMC fell in early trade * Bank of England meeting * Egypt central bank meets * Japan auctions 30-yr bonds * U.S. corporate events: Cigna, Bristol Myers-Squib, Merck, New York Times, Ford, Motorola"

Japan’s finance ministry received bids worth 3.47 times the amount of bonds offered, which was higher than the bid-cover ratio of 2.98 times at the previous auction of 30-year debt last month. The results supported the long end of the market. The 20-year JGB yield fell 0.5 basis point to 0.455%, while the 30-year yield shed 0.5 basis point to 0.660%. The 40-year JGB yield slid down 0.5 basis point to 0.700%. But shorter maturities failed to catch up, after U.S. Treasury yields rose overnight on stronger economic data and a push in Washington to pass a massive relief plan to aid the coronavirus-battered economy. Benchmark 10-year JGB futures fell 0.12 point to 151.62, while the 10-year JGB yield was flat at 0.055%.

1.5196542781039613," U.S. Treasury names officials expected to lead Biden's global tax crackdown WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury announced several hires to top posts on Wednesday, and sources said the new officials plan to push a key part of President Joe Biden’s economic agenda: ramping up tax enforcement and regulation at home and overseas. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen added a clutch of former Obama administration officials to her leadership circle who have extensive tax, legal and international economics backgrounds. Former International Monetary Fund official David Lipton will serve as a senior counselor to Yellen, an appointment first reported by Reuters on Tuesday. He will be joined by Itai Grinberg and Tom West, whose backgrounds are in tax policy, and Federal Reserve lawyer Laurie Schaffer. Yellen is expected to push for broad changes to global tax enforcement and regulation, with the personal blessing of Biden, a person with direct knowledge of the matter. Biden is seeking sharper enforcement of existing laws to reduce income inequality and to pay for spending proposals, the person said. The Treasury Department said that in calls with foreign ministers from the allied United Kingdom, Germany, France and Italy since her swearing in, Yellen has discussed tax issues, including finding ways to “efficiently and equitably” tax multinational companies’ income. She also pledged to rejoin Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development negotiations on taxing large multinational technology services companies such as Facebook Inc and Google that her predecessor, Steven Mnuchin, had abandoned. Over a dozen countries have imposed unilateral taxes on such digital services. Biden has argued that large tech companies sometimes shoulder too small a tax burden. His administration is also considering new guidance to the Internal Revenue Service, sanctions targeting tax havens and synchronizing the U.S. tax approach with other countries, according to the person familiar with the matter. The new hires can be expected to help the Democratic president fulfill his pledge to unwind previous President Donald Trump’s tax legacy, which included slashing corporate taxes and reducing enforcement. Treasury and White House spokespersons did not immediately respond to requests for more details on the administration’s tax strategy. The Internal Revenue Service in 2019 estimated that the average annual gross tax gap - the difference between taxes legally owed and those collected - averaged $441 billion for the tax years 2011 through 2013, largely through underreporting of individual, payroll and corporate income. The tax act passed by Trump and Republicans in late 2017 slashed corporate taxes by 40%, and the reduced revenue contributed to a wider federal deficit. The tax team is being built up more quickly than other areas of Treasury. Lipton, who was the No. 2 official at the IMF for over eight years, and led the institution’s policy development, is expected to assist Yellen with outreach to U.S. allies on economic policy matters and coordination of G20 and G7 finance meetings and summits, people familiar with his appointment said. West, a tax adviser at the auditing company KPMG International Ltd who spent five years in the Treasury Office of Tax Policy under former President Barack Obama, will return to as deputy assistant Secretary for domestic business tax, Treasury said. Grinberg, who served in international tax roles during the George W. Bush and Obama administrations, is returning to Treasury as deputy assistant secretary for multilateral tax in the Office of Tax Policy, after a decade as a Georgetown Law School professor. Schaffer, a Federal Reserve Board deputy general counsel, would return to Treasury as principal deputy general counsel, the department said. Schaffer had been Treasury assistant general counsel for banking and finance from 2008-2011. Treasury also named Fordham University tax law professor Rebecca Kysar as counselor to the assistant secretary of tax policy. An expert on international tax law, Kysar helped Biden’s transition team review tax policy and the Treasury department."
1.5196542781039613," Venezuela's offshore funds could pay for vaccines but Maduro not cooperating, Guaido says CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuelan opposition leader Juan Guaido said on Wednesday that Venezuelan funds controlled by the U.S. Treasury Department could be used to pay for coronavirus vaccines but that President Nicolas Maduro’s government is refusing to cooperate. The government has not accepted an implementation plan laid out by the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) that would enable Venezuela to join the COVAX program, and has not fulfilled a prior deal regarding distribution of COVID-19 tests. “The (problem) is not the funds, that’s the dictatorship’s propaganda to try to excuse itself and point fingers and confuse the whole world,” Guaido told a press conference. “If we are willing, and the regime is not, the funds cannot be transferred.” Venezuela’s information ministry and the U.S. Treasury did not immediately reply to requests for comment. Ciro Ugarte, PAHO’s director of health emergencies, told another press conference on Wednesday that Maduro had “announced his interest in obtaining access to vaccines via the COVAX mechanism, as well as from other sources, and the Guaido group has also expressed that intention”. The United States in 2019 recognized Guaido as Venezuela’s legitimate president and created a sanctions package against the Maduro government that included the seizure of nearly $350 million held in U.S. accounts. Part of those funds were used last year to obtain test kits and personal protective equipment for medical workers, following an agreement between Venezuelan officials and opposition leaders, Guaido said. Venezuela needs to pay more than $100 million to get access to vaccines through the global COVAX program that allocates access to shots for poorer countries, according to estimates by diplomats familiar with the situation. Maduro’s allies in recent weeks have said Venezuela cannot pay due to sanctions. PAHO said last month Venezuela had used only 1% of the coronavirus tests it had received, and Venezuela’s opposition said Maduro had not honored deals to distribute equipment and tests. Maduro has said the South American country will receive 10 million doses of the Sputnik V vaccine from ally Russia. A PAHO official said on Tuesday that between 1.4 million and 2.4 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine had been reserved for Venezuela and could arrive by the end of February, but that Caracas would have to pay for them by Feb. 9. PAHO had previously said that Venezuela would not be able to participate in the COVAX facility due to a lack of timely payments by the government."

1.5196542781039613," U.S. Treasury keeps auction sizes steady after recent increases Feb 3 (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department said on Wednesday that its recent efforts to increase the size of nominal Treasury auctions have created sufficient capacity for its near-term funding, and that any new increases in funding needs will be met with increases in Treasury bill auction sizes or cash management bills. The Treasury next week will sell $58 billion in three-year notes, $41 billion in 10-year notes and $27 billion in 30-year bonds, unchanged over last month. The U.S. Treasury said on Monday it plans to borrow $274 billion in the first quarter, significantly lower than the November estimate of $1.127 trillion, with the decline due to the department’s higher cash balance at the beginning of January. “Since April 2020, Treasury has substantially increased issuance sizes for nominal coupon and (floating rate note) securities and begun a gradual increase in (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) issuance. Treasury believes that these changes have created sufficient capacity to address near-term projected borrowing needs,” The Treasury said in a statement on Wednesday. The Treasury last year issued record amounts of Treasuries to finance spending meant to offset the damage of COVID-19 related business shutdowns. A $900 billion stimulus bill was not signed into law until Dec. 27, however, leaving the Treasury with a larger than anticipated cash balance of $1.729 trillion at the end of 2020.

1.5196542781039613," Exclusive: Treasury's Yellen calls top regulator meeting on GameStop volatility, consults ethics lawyer WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is calling a meeting of top financial regulators this week to discuss market volatility driven by retail trading in shares of GameStop Corp , silver and other stocks favored on social media. Yellen will convene the heads of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Federal Reserve, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Treasury said on Tuesday. Yellen sought and received permission from ethics lawyers before calling the meeting, according to a document seen by Reuters, along with clearance to engage on wide-ranging issues in the financial services industry. Yellen's decision to seek the waiver followed a report here by Reuters that because of speaking fees she was paid by a key player in the GameStop saga, hedge fund Citadel LLC, she may need permission to deal with matters involving the firm. A Treasury official, who declined to be identified by name, said the meeting would be held this week, possibly as early as Thursday. “Secretary Yellen believes the integrity of markets is important and has asked for a discussion of recent volatility in financial markets and whether recent activities are consistent with investor protection and fair and efficient markets,” Treasury spokeswoman Alexandra LaManna said in a statement to Reuters. Yellen’s action comes after days of gyrations in the shares of video-game retailer GameStop, headphone maker Koss Corp, cinema chain AMC Entertainment and other stocks and commodities favored on the Reddit social media site’s Wall Street Bets forum. Retail traders last week bid up the shares to force short-sellers, who profit if a stock falls, to close their positions at massive losses, sending GameStop to a dizzying high of $483. But GameStop crashed back to earth, closing down 60% at $90 on Tuesday, leaving many traders with huge losses. Silver prices also fell. The SEC last week warned here that ""extreme stock price volatility has the potential to expose investors to rapid and severe losses and undermine market confidence."" The Federal Reserve Board declined to comment and the SEC, New York Fed and CFTC did not respond to queries about the meeting late on Tuesday. The Treasury official said Yellen was looking for an update from the top U.S. financial regulators. The meeting signals heightened concern about the volatility just a week after Yellen was sworn in as the first female U.S. Treasury secretary. The saga is likely to expedite a regulatory review of the ever-larger role played by non-bank firms in the financial markets, regulatory experts say. One of these is Citadel, which extended hedge fund Melvin Capital a $2.75 billion lifeline last week after the latter firm suffered massive losses in short positions. Yellen earned more than $700,000 in speaking fees from Citadel, as recently as last fall. In an ethics agreement here, she pledged not to involve herself in specific matters involving the firm - as well as major banks including Citigroup, Barclays and Goldman Sachs - without first seeking authorization. Treasury ethics attorneys have given Yellen flexibility to work on any related markets or broad financial services sector issues, with no limits on current or future matters, the Treasury official said. She may need to seek further authorization to deal with specific firms she listed. In the memo granting Yellen permission to call the meeting of regulators, a Treasury ethics official, Brian Sonfield, said it would be “difficult, if not impossible” for Yellen to recuse herself from matters involving market volatility. “You are the Secretary of the Treasury, the duties of which require you to be involved in a broad array of matters focused on these sectors,” Sonfield wrote. “Issues relating to these sectors could arise at any time without the opportunity for consultation with the ethics office,” and “argue in favor of prior authorization.”"
1.5196542781039613," EXCLUSIVE-Yellen to name ex-IMF official Lipton to senior Treasury role, sources say David Lipton, an economist who served as a senior official at the International Monetary Fund and U.S. Treasury, will return to government service as a senior adviser to Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, six sources familiar with the matter said. Lipton will focus on the U.S. role within the Group of Seven advanced economies and the larger Group of 20 economies in a temporary role, several sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity. His appointment comes as the world's top economies are struggling to manage the coronavirus pandemic and ensure a nascent global recovery stays on course. The White House and Treasury had no comment. Lipton did not respond to an emailed request for comment. Bringing Lipton on board to guide international matters will free Yellen to focus on the U.S. economy and work to ensure passage of President Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion economic rescue plan, the sources said. The plan has run into resistance from Republicans in Congress, and Democrats on Tuesday took a first step toward fast-tracking the bill without Republican support. [nL1N2K81MU] ""Lipton's presence in the Yellen Treasury is a huge boost for the department's international efforts. He brings immediate credibility and signals that the Biden administration intends to hit the ground running in responding to the economic dimensions of this crisis globally,"" said Scott Morris, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development and a former Treasury official. ""That would be great news!"" tweeted German Finance State Secretary Wolfgang Schmidt. Lipton's experience on international economic issues and his tenure as Treasury undersecretary for international affairs from 1993 to 1998 in the administration of former President Bill Clinton will help Washington as it seeks to rebuild ties with allies and multilateral institutions, people familiar with his assignment said. Several of the sources said Lipton's assignment would help bridge a gap in staffing as Yellen assembles her team. The Senate has not yet scheduled a confirmation hearing for Yellen's nominated deputy, Wally Adeyemo, and the Biden administration has not yet announced its pick for the international post at Treasury, or who will serve as the G7/G20 sherpa, a job normally housed at the White House. The sources welcomed Lipton's return to official life after IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva ousted him as her top deputy one year ago, some 19 months before his official term was due to expire. He had served nearly 8-1/2 years in the role. Widely respected in economic circles, Lipton, 67, was often critical of former President Donald Trump's trade policies and tariff actions, which triggered heavy costs for U.S. companies and farmers and spawned significant tensions with allies. Lipton began his professional career as an economist at the IMF in 1981, and in addition to his role in the Clinton administration, he held a senior role in the administration of former President Barack Obama. Allies are looking for more muscular U.S. leadership on global issues ranging from climate change, battling the pandemic and staving off a wave of sovereign debt defaults among low-income countries. IMF officials have warned of continued uncertainty and divergent economic trends that threaten to push an additional 90 million people into poverty, as even advanced economies struggle to distribute COVID-19 vaccines. Lipton will also likely have to wade into global talks on taxation after those negotiations came to a standstill under former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. It was not immediately clear when Lipton would start in his new role, but the move could happen quickly since the job does not require Senate confirmation. G7 finance officials are due to meet remotely on Feb. 15, while G20 finance officials are due to meet Feb. 26-27, with debt issues and the financing needs of low-income and emerging market economies a priority. Consensus is building for a new allocation of IMF Special Drawing Rights, a move akin to a central bank printing money, that was blocked by Mnuchin. Such a move would provide extra reserves to every IMF member at a time when funding needs remain large, especially for low-income countries hit hard by COVID-19. The Biden administration has signaled support for a new allocation of SDRs, and legislation to back such a move is working its way through the now Democratic-controlled Congress.

After Asian shares rose overnight, European equity indexes opened higher, with market participants optimistic before negotiations between U.S. President Joe Biden and Republican senators on a new COVID-19 support bill. “The tone in global market strikes as us as more upbeat than last week,” wrote ING rates strategists in a note to clients. “The focus on US fiscal stimulus could add upside to global yields, and help resume the USD-EUR rates widening trend.” The benchmark German 10-year Bund yield was up around two basis points at -0.4980% at 0817 GMT, having risen by around 6 bps in the past seven days. The spread between the German benchmark yield and the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield was at 159 basis points . In Italy, talks aimed at reviving the collapsed ruling coalition were stuck on policy issues, political sources said. Riskier Italian bonds yields edged higher, with the 10-year up around 1 basis point at 0.636%. Data on Monday showed that the European Central Bank kept its purchases of Italian government bonds steady in the last two months, even as the country went through a political crisis that briefly pushed up its borrowing costs. ECB bond-buying under the Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme (PEPP) was lower than it was the week before. “The reduction in the pace of purchases is perhaps not surprising when one considers that the ECB is simply aiming to maintain low rates and spreads, rather than to push them even lower,” wrote the ING strategists. “Provided the ECB remains credible in enforcing favourable financing conditions, something that is much more easily achieved for sovereign bond markets than for household credit for instance, then private investors might be happy to continue buying long-dated syndicated deals,” they said. Elsewhere, preliminary French inflation data showed a 0.8% increase year-on-year in January, higher than a forecast of 0.4%. Italy’s fourth-quarter gross domestic product is due at 0900 GMT and euro zone fourth-quarter GDP at 1000 GMT. “Evidence suggests that the euro area economy may have begun to adapt to the effects of lockdown with increased online shopping and better-targeted lockdown measures, meaning that the Q4 lockdowns likely had a smaller impact than previously thought,” wrote RBC Capital Markets strategists in a note.

1.765455760783009," Analysis: GameStop saga may provide early test of Biden administration ethics pledges WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Arguably the last thing new U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen wants to take up during her first days in office is a financial market imbroglio involving one of her last private sector business relationships. But as hedge fund Citadel LLC emerges as one of the key actors in the trading frenzy last week involving GameStop Corp - and questions arise over whether the activity exposes deeper risks for the financial system - Yellen could find herself pulled into the fray. Citadel, together with another fund, extended a $2.75 billion financial lifeline to hedge fund Melvin Capital Management, which had suffered heavy losses by betting against GameStop. Citadel Securities, a separate trading arm, pays Robinhood to execute its users’ trades, a practice that has drawn some concern from investor advocates. The White House has said Yellen is among a handful of officials monitoring the fracas. As head of the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC), Yellen is broadly responsible for the health of the entire trading and investing system. A sticking point for her to clear, though, may be $700,000 in speaking fees she accepted from Citadel, as recently as last fall. Yellen has pledged not to involve herself in an official capacity in matters involving the firm without first seeking a written waiver from Treasury ethics officials. Ethics experts say that pledge is not a hard wall for her to scale should the need arise. After ethics violations dogged the Trump administration, some groups are urging Yellen to pre-emptively seek a waiver, and set a precedent. “This example is a good test of Biden’s ethics executive order and the transparency that follows, but it also highlights the revolving door and why restrictions are necessary to protect the integrity of government missions, policies, and programs,” said Scott Amey, general counsel at Project On Government Oversight, a nonpartisan government watchdog group. The Treasury secretary normally does not get involved in matters involving individual stocks and concentrates instead on broad systemic risks to the financial system, which the department monitors through daily market surveillance. “Secretary Yellen of course will abide by her ethics agreement and ethics pledge in all instances,” Treasury spokesman Calvin Mitchell said. He did not indicate how she would approach the specific Citadel issue. Like many former government officials, including here her Federal Reserve chair predecessor Ben Bernanke, Yellen took speaking fees from private companies after she left government. Yellen filed an ethics agreement here with the Office of Government Ethics in December saying she would ""seek written authorization to participate personally and substantially in any particular matter"" related to any companies that paid her speaking fees prior to joining President Joe Biden's administration - for a year after her last speech to each firm. Yellen spoke several times at Citadel, most recently on an Oct. 27 webinar, according to the filing. She was paid at least $700,000 in speaking fees by the Citadel while she was in private practice at the Brookings Institution think tank, another disclosure here shows. These speaking engagements, which also include financial heavyweights such as Barclays, Citigroup, and Goldman Sachs, are not likely to impact her ability to give Biden broad advice on the stock trading matter, government ethics experts say. “If this becomes a situation where regulators are considering new rulemaking with Citadel as the poster-child, that’s different,” said Lisa Gilbert, executive vice president of Public Citizen, a group pushing for stronger financial regulation. A major question is whether volatility from Gamestop and similar retail investor revolts against short-squeezes boil over into a systemic event that sends markets crashing broadly. Typically a matter involving an individual stock or equity market trading and brokerages would fall to the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has said it is examining the matter. On Friday, SEC commissioners including acting chair Allison Herren Lee said in a statement here they were closely monitoring the extreme volatility in certain stocks and warned market participants to ""uphold their obligations to protect investors and to identify and pursue potential wrongdoing."" Extreme stock price volatility “has the potential to expose investors to rapid and severe losses and undermine market confidence,” they added. Biden’s choice to run the SEC, Gary Gensler, awaits Senate hearings. The FSOC that Yellen chairs is charged with identifying risks and responding to emerging threats to financial stability. It includes the heads of the Federal Reserve and other major U.S. financial regulatory agencies. It has the authority to designate non-bank financial institutions for consolidated supervision to minimize risk to the financial system or to break up firms that pose a “grave threat.” Distress in individual companies rarely rises to such a level. Treasury maintains daily market surveillance, but it is looking for orderly market functioning and broad systemic threats. Thus far, the situation looks contained, Barclays said in a note to clients on Friday. Short positions in stocks favored on the Reddit social media site total about $40 billion, which would limit the pain to a handful of hedge funds. “The ongoing short squeeze in a few stocks by retail investors has raised concerns of a broader contagion. While we believe there is more pain to come, we remain optimistic that it is likely to remain localized,” Barclays said. Unlike many previous Treasury secretaries, Yellen has only worked as an academic and for the government, not at a bank or trading firm. Richard Painter, a former top ethics lawyer to President George W. Bush, said many Treasury secretaries had a great deal more entanglements that would raise conflict of interest concerns than Yellen. Henry Paulson, a Republican who was U.S. Treasury secretary during the 2008 financial meltdown, sold half a billion dollars in stock from his former employer Goldman Sachs Group Inc to satisfy ethics concerns. Paulson later forced Goldman and other major banks to take billions of dollars in taxpayer capital at the depth of the financial crisis. Steven Mnuchin, Yellen's immediate predecessor, pledged here after he was nominated to divest $94 million in investments, and refrain from any decisions involving CIT Group until August 2018, when he was due a payment of $5 million from the company. “Yellen is going to be about as clean as you can get on this stuff,” Painter said.

1.275422156469718," U.S. Treasury slashes first-quarter borrowing estimate due to higher cash balance (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury said on Monday it plans to borrow $274 billion in the first quarter, significantly lower than the November estimate of $1.127 trillion, with the decline due to the department’s higher cash balance at the beginning of January. The Treasury last year increased its borrowing projections to account for an estimated $1 trillion in fiscal spending to address the economic devastation from COVID-19-related business shutdowns. A $900 billion stimulus bill was not signed into law until Dec. 27, however, leaving the Treasury with a larger than anticipated cash balance of $1.729 trillion at the end of 2020. Current borrowing projections do not account for any new fiscal spending, as any predictions are unlikely to be correct and may differ from what other market participants expect. “There’s just a wide range in what is being proposed in potential future legislation,” a senior Treasury official said on a call with reporters. The first-quarter borrowing estimate assumes an end-March cash balance of $800 billion, the Treasury said in a statement. For the second quarter of 2021, the Treasury said it plans to issue $95 billion in net marketable debt, assuming an end-June cash balance of $500 billion.

1.275422156469718," Exclusive: Tunisia to issue up to $3 billion debt and push reforms this year, finance minister says TUNIS (Reuters) - Tunisia will issue debt worth up to $3 billion this year and aims to roll over some existing credit arrangements while setting in train wider economic reforms, Finance Minister Ali Kooli told Reuters in an interview. With a deficit estimated at 11.5% of gross domestic product last year and public debt at 90% of GDP, Tunisia plans reforms to cut its high public wage bill and subsidies and restructure poorly performing state-owned companies, Kooli said. The COVID-19 pandemic, political infighting and ongoing protests over inequality have added to the pressure on the government, while foreign lenders and the powerful labour union have often made competing demands on reform. “Our situation is tough, but it doesn’t mean that we aren’t in a position to pay salaries or reimburse our debt”, said Kooli, adding that Tunisia could comfortably meet repayments due in the first half of 2021. Tunisia’s 2021 budget forecasts borrowing needs at 19.5 billion Tunisian dinars ($7.2 billion), including about $5 billion in foreign loans. It puts debt repayments due this year at 16 billion dinars, up from 11 billion dinars in 2020. Kooli said Tunisia wants a new $1 billion loan guarantee arrangement from the United States, which he said could help it secure the $3 billion in bond issuance, the first time he has given that figure. The government also hopes to reach agreement with the International Monetary Fund on a new financing programme, and he said recent Article IV consultations were a step towards that. However, Kooli said Tunisia had not yet decided how much new international debt to seek and that it was taking steps to improve its credit rating and gain IMF blessing for the move. “I believe there is a real possibility to go to the markets for at least $1 billion during 2021,” he said, adding that the higher sum of $3 billion would also be possible. Tunisia is looking at various instruments including a sukuk for the first time, a club deal, a specific action for the Asian market or a dollar-denominated bond issue, Kooli said, without elaborating. The government may also issue, separately, a sukuk for the domestic market before July, he said, adding that it could be in the region of around 300 million dinars. Tunisia will switch to targeted subsidies in coming months, he said, and will announce restructuring plans for state-owned companies after Ramadan, which this year ends in mid-May. However, the pandemic may delay some reforms both to avoid increasing the economic pain for ordinary Tunisians and because it is not a good time to attract potential investment in state companies. Targeted subsidies will involve distributing digital cards for lower-income Tunisians as well as other measures, he said. However, the government is still assessing how many people require help, what price different products should be and how to avoid a big rise in inflation, he said. Although Prime Minister Hichem Mechichi has already announced a new unit to take over state-owned companies from direct control by government ministries, the details of reforms will not be announced until they are finalised, Kooli said. He confirmed the government would sell its share in some firms but did not identify them. He questioned whether the state needed to hold minority shares in companies, whether it needed to own stock in 12 banks, as now, or in gambling. Any revenues raised by privatisation would be pumped back into other state-owned companies that the government wants to restructure, he said. Tunisia’s main labour union, the UGTT, has previously resisted any privatisation, but Kooli said he expected no trouble there, adding the government was “not looking for a fight”. On the public sector wage bill, Kooli said the government was looking at different ways to reduce it, for example by offering slightly lower pay for greatly reduced hours. “The possibility to work half time and be paid a little bit more than half salary is an avenue we are considering,” he said.

1.0329481925944553," U.S. delays Chinese investment ban's impact on certain firms WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Wednesday updated its ban on investments in certain Chinese military companies by delaying until May the application of the directive’s restrictions on companies with names similar to those that have been blacklisted. In a statement posted on the U.S. Treasury Department website, the Biden administration said most investments in companies “whose name closely matches, but does not exactly match, the name of a Communist Chinese military company” would be allowed until May 27, extending the deadline which was originally set to Jan. 28. The order does not authorize securities transactions with subsidiaries of banned Chinese military companies, it added. In November, former U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration moved to prohibit U.S. investments in Chinese companies that Washington said were owned or controlled by the Chinese military in an effort to ramp up pressure on Beijing. The order required U.S. investors to completely divest their holdings in the firms by Nov. 11, 2021 and was seen as part of a bid by Trump to cement his tough-on-China legacy and box Biden into hardline policies on Beijing. The blacklist of alleged Chinese military companies was mandated by a 1999 law but the Defense Department only began complying by publishing names of the firms last year. The catalogue now includes 44 companies including China’s top chipmaker SMIC and oil giant CNOOC.

In a statement posted on the U.S. Treasury Department website, the Biden administration said most investments in companies ""whose name closely matches, but does not exactly match, the name of a Communist Chinese military company"" would be allowed until May 27, extending the deadline which was originally set to Jan. 28. The order does not authorize securities transactions with subsidiaries of banned Chinese military companies, it added. In November, former U.S. President Donald Trump's administration moved to prohibit U.S. investments in Chinese companies that Washington said were owned or controlled by the Chinese military in an effort to ramp up pressure on Beijing. The order required U.S. investors to completely divest their holdings in the firms by Nov. 11, 2021and was seen as part of a bid by Trump to cement his tough-on-China legacy and box Biden into hardline policies on Beijing. read more The blacklist of alleged Chinese military companies was mandated by a 1999 law but the Defense Department only began complying by publishing names of the firms last year.

0.9510837802589404," U.S. Treasury resuming steps to put Harriet Tubman on $20 bill - White House WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury Department is taking steps to resume efforts to put escaped slave and abolitionist Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill, White House and Treasury officials said on Monday, saying the move would reflect U.S. history and diversity. The redesigned bill was initially to be unveiled in 2020, but those efforts were delayed by the Treasury after former President Donald Trump called them an example of “pure political correctness.” White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said the Treasury was revisiting the effort, which was first announced 2016 under former President Barack Obama, but floundered under Trump. “It’s important that our notes are... reflective of the history and diversity of our country and Harriet Tubman’s image gracing the new $20 note would certainly reflect that,” Psaki said. “So we are exploring ways to speed up that effort.” Treasury spokeswoman Alexandra LaManna said a fresh push to put Tubman’s image on the widely used $20 bill was underway. President Joe Biden has made diversity a centerpiece of his administration, marking a sharp contrast to the Trump administration, which sought to downplay the role of slavery in the country’s history. As a presidential candidate, Trump suggested Tubman would be better-suited for the $2 bill, a note that is not widely circulated. Former U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told lawmakers in May 2019 that he was focused on redesigning bills to address counterfeiting issues, not making changes to their imagery, and said no imagery changes were likely until 2026. It was not immediately clear how much that push could be accelerated given the complexity of redesigning a new bill with the needed counterfeiting and security features. A high-speed printing facility needed to produce a new $20 note is currently scheduled to open in 2025. Under the plans announced in 2016, Tubman, who was born into slavery and grew up on a Maryland plantation before escaping in her late 20s, would replace Andrew Jackson, the seventh president of the United States, on the front of the $20 bill. Tubman returned to the South many times to help hundreds of slaves to freedom and later worked as a Union spy during the Civil War. She died in 1913. No women have been depicted on U.S. bills since former first lady Martha Washington, who was featured on the $1 silver certificate from 1891 to 1896, and Native American Pocahontas, who was part of a group image on the $20 bill from 1865 to 1869. Other women, including Native American interpreter Sacagawea, suffragist Susan B. Anthony and author and activist Helen Keller have been featured on coins. Jackson has been criticized for his ownership of slaves and treatment of American Indians. In the redesign announced in 2016, his image would have remained on the back of the $20 bill."

1.179734826647494," Big U.S. banks hunger for loans, capital relief as deposits pile up (Reuters) - A swell of deposits during the coronavirus pandemic has put big U.S. banks on the back foot, with executives saying they hope regulators provide relief on rules that punish bloated balance sheets until loan demand snaps back. JPMorgan Chase & Co, Bank of America Corp and Citigroup took in more than $1 trillion in deposits last year, compared with a $92 billion increase in 2019. In a more normal economy, that kind of boost would be great, allowing banks to lend more or simply invest the money in short-term, low-risk securities, like Treasury bonds. But the stimulus payments and easy-money policies by the government that led to the inundation of deposits has also created a few problems for the banks: low interest rates that crimp lending profitability and stunted loan demand as customers and companies awash with cash spend less. Combined with rules that require more capital for bigger balance sheets, that makes deposits more expensive to hold, instead of profitable. “Excess liquidity is piling up,” Bank of America Chief Financial Officer Paul Donofrio said during a conference call on Tuesday after the bank reported record deposit growth. Profit margins on new deposits are “practically zero,” JPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Jennifer Piepszak said last week. Citigroup’s $210 billion deposit increase pushed it into a new bracket under Fed rules, requiring the bank to hold more capital, the bank said last week. Big banks will not shun deposits due to the dynamic, executives said, because doing so could hurt their franchises. However, they did push regulators to extend capital relief programs that expire March 31. Banks also want adjustments for holdings that are not high risk, like U.S. Treasury securities. “It is an issue for us in the near to medium term should we not get the extension,” Piepszak said."

1.5041560915688228," RPT-ANALYSIS-Ultra long bonds are back in force as rock-bottom rates create sweet spot More governments are selling bonds that mature in 30, 50 and even 100 years' time, capitalising on rock-bottom borrowing costs and a willingness among investors to look past risks for the sake of slightly higher yields. After Germany's state of North Rhine Westphalia (NRW) raised 2 billion euros on Jan. 5 via a 100-year issue, France said on Monday it would soon sell a 50-year bond, its first new debt at that maturity since 2016. A brisk start that has also seen Mexico and Indonesia sell 50-year bonds could mean issuance volumes approach levels seen in 2016, when euro zone governments sold a record 19 billion euros of bonds with maturities of 30 years and over. ""It feels more like 2016,"" said Lee Cumbes, head of public sector debt, EMEA at Barclays. ""Considering firm demand from investors and the issuers' current perspective, it seems like things are lining up for a high volume market again this year."" For borrowers, it's a no-brainer -- selling ultra-long debt allows them to lock in interest rates squashed to historically low levels by central bank stimulus. Governments might also seek to smooth out a jump in borrowing to cover the costs of coronavirus; euro area net issuance alone will reach 541 billion euros this year, Societe Generale estimates, versus 531 billion euros in 2020. That backdrop of low interest rates has already seen many euro zone governments extend the average maturity of their debt since the bloc's crisis of last decade, saving taxpayer money. Ultra-long debt nevertheless remains a fraction of the overall market, accounting last year for about 14.6 billion euros of an estimated 1.23 trillion of gross issuance by euro zone governments, Rabobank data shows. Long issues carry risks for investors, however -- above all of inflation rearing its head and hurting bond prices. And the longer the tenor, the greater such duration risk.

1.5041560915688228," Analysis: Ultra long bonds are back in force as rock-bottom rates create sweet spot LONDON (Reuters) - More governments are selling bonds that mature in 30, 50 and even 100 years’ time, capitalising on rock-bottom borrowing costs and a willingness among investors to look past risks for the sake of slightly higher yields. After Germany’s state of North Rhine Westphalia (NRW) raised 2 billion euros on Jan. 5 via a 100-year issue, France said on Monday it would soon sell a 50-year bond, its first new debt at that maturity since 2016. A brisk start that has also seen Mexico and Indonesia sell 50-year bonds could mean issuance volumes approach levels seen in 2016, when euro zone governments sold a record 19 billion euros of bonds with maturities of 30 years and over. “It feels more like 2016,” said Lee Cumbes, head of public sector debt, EMEA at Barclays. “Considering firm demand from investors and the issuers’ current perspective, it seems like things are lining up for a high volume market again this year.” For borrowers, it’s a no-brainer -- selling ultra-long debt allows them to lock in interest rates squashed to historically low levels by central bank stimulus. Governments might also seek to smooth out a jump in borrowing to cover the costs of coronavirus; euro area net issuance alone will reach 541 billion euros this year, Societe Generale estimates, versus 531 billion euros in 2020. That backdrop of low interest rates has already seen many euro zone governments extend the average maturity of their debt since the bloc’s crisis of last decade, saving taxpayer money. Ultra-long debt nevertheless remains a fraction of the overall market, accounting last year for about 14.6 billion euros of an estimated 1.23 trillion of gross issuance by euro zone governments, Rabobank data shows.

U.S. Treasury prices posted substantial gains on Tuesday for the first time this year, bringing down the benchmark 10-year yield to 1.121% from a 10-month high of 1.187%. The upbeat mood in global bonds overrode a small disappointment after an auction of 2.5 trillion yen five-year JGBs drew tepid demand. The auction’s tail widened to 0.03 from 0.02 in the previous auction, while the bid-to-cover ratio fell to 3.83 from 3.96.

0.529467003983941," Biden to unveil trillions in pandemic economic relief spending next week WILMINGTON, Del. (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Joe Biden said Americans need more economic relief from the coronavirus pandemic now and that he will deliver a plan costing “trillions” of dollars next week. Biden, introducing several members of his economic team, spoke on Friday after data showed the U.S. economy lost jobs for the first time in eight months in December as a resurgent COVID-19 pandemic shuttered restaurants and other businesses. He said the proposal includes relief for state and local governments grappling with the pandemic, as well as new support for people who lost their jobs or cannot afford rent. Biden also called for raising the minimum wage to $15, a campaign promise, and for sending out $2,000 in direct cash payments. Democrats sought those cash payouts in the last relief bill, passed in December, but only were able to get Republicans to agree to $600. “We need more direct relief flowing to families, small businesses, including finishing the job of getting people that $2,000 relief direct payment. $600 is simply not enough,” he said. Biden said he would unveil the plan on Thursday. The Democrat, who takes office on Jan. 20, emerged emboldened from a pair of Senate elections this week in Georgia that handed Democrats a majority in that chamber to complement control of the House of Representatives. The majorities could allow Biden to pass larger spending bills. Biden’s initial plan was for a bill under $1 trillion but he said on Friday that “economic research confirms that with conditions like the crisis today, especially with such low interest rates, taking immediate action - even with deficit financing - is going to help the economy.” Speaking to reporters as he announced his nominees to head the Commerce and Labor departments, the president-elect said action was needed to help Americans get to the other side of the health and economic crisis, and to “avoid a broader economic cost that exists out there, that will happen due to long term unemployment, hunger, homelessness and business failings.” Markets have reacted quickly to expectations that government spending will rise since Democrats won the Georgia elections, with stock indexes rising and the interest investors demand on 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds climbing to their highest levels since March. Yet Republicans and even some Democrats may be resistant to greater deficit-fueled spending, with Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat from West Virginia, among those who initially greeted the idea skeptically. Biden’s transition team also said on Friday that they are looking into other economic relief actions they can take unilaterally, including extending a pause on repayments of federal student loans."

0.44766115114958216," Investors react after Trump supporters storm Capitol, Dems sweep Senate TOKYO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Asian stocks and U.S. stock futures rose on Thursday, while Treasury yields remained high and the dollar unwound overnight losses after supporters of President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol and Democrats won control of the U.S. Senate after runoff races in Georgia. Following are investor comments after a tumultuous day in U.S. politics: MATHAN SOMASUNDARAM, HEAD OF RESEARCH FIRM DEEP DATA ANALYTICS, SYDNEY “It’s basically a reflation trade. Anything that benefits from rising prices is going to do well. “The market had a one-way bet that the Republicans were going to win both seats in the Georgia runoff...but as we found out that didn’t happen, and that changes a lot. “The reason why there’s a reflation trade is when you look at the policy settings they are trying to get through, it’s about printing to the Main Street and not Wall Street. “Taxes and regulations will go up, but they will be printing a lot more money and giving a lot more support for consumer spending, so it favours the domestic economy over support for corporate profits. “A huge amount of money has come out of the bond market. Even though only a portion of that went into equities, it’s jammed up equities. When passive money moves around this is what happens.” AKIRA TAKEI, GLOBAL FIXED INCOME FUND MANAGER, ASSET MANAGEMENT ONE, TOKYO “The rise in yields and stocks can be explained by the Blue Wave and expectations that Biden’s win will lead to massive fiscal stimulus, but I think fiscal stimulus is an old story. “The events in Washington show that the United States is divided and we have to question whether the people will be united once again. It looks like maybe not. “This is bad for equities and the dollar. The equities rally is already over-extended and looks like a bubble. I can’t see Treasury yields rising much further from here. It looks like a good level to buy Treasuries.” JASON TEH, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, VERTIUM ASSET MANAGEMENT, SYDNEY “Commodities are up and banks are up. The catalyst for that is really the Democrat win of the Senate, and in fact you can see it in the intra-market movements. “Tech came off and anything considered value - or really ‘old-economy’ stocks - moved up. “Biden now has a greater pathway to approve his laws. “There’s only one way a riot can de-rail the stock market and that’s if it spills over into the economy. If a riot results in a lockdown, like what you would expect with a COVID lockdown, then you could potentially see stock market ramifications - but these feel more like skirmishes rather than a wide lockdown.” MASAFUMI YAMAMOTO, CHIEF CURRENCY STRATEGIST, MIZUHO SECURITIES, TOKYO “The mob has interrupted to the process of Biden’s confirmation, but the mob will not overturn the process because Republicans are saying no to that. “The market is optimistic that Biden’s victory will not be overturned. “Realisation of the Democratic sweep will be positive for the U.S. economy, U.S. stocks, and the dollar. “Higher Treasury yields should benefit the dollar against the euro and the yen, because the dollar has underpriced the potential for U.S economic recovery under Biden. “However, the dollar will remain weaker against commodity currencies like the Aussie and emerging market currencies. “Markets are trying to position for a U.S. economic recovery. This is easy to do in Treasuries and stocks.” TIM CHUBB, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, GIRARD, WEST CHESTER, PENNSYLVANIA “What give us a little bit of a pause is that the economy is still very fragile and I think it’s unlikely that Democrats are going to have as easy of a time as markets are trying to predict in passing some of these policies. Especially when it comes to tax reform, I think the window is relatively small. It’s going to be difficult to achieve that level of tax reform and some of these restrictive policies as cooler heads prevail and the Democratic process works itself out.” “What market is really (keen on) is more stimulus. We’ve seen over the course of 2020 Democratic party be much more open to providing stimulus to vulnerable Americans. That, along with additional support for greater fiscal policy as we climb out of COVID-19 downdraft in the economy and hopes for an infrastructure bill.” GUY LEBAS, CHIEF FIXED INCOME STRATEGIST, JANNEY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, PHILADELPHIA “The Georgia senatorial elections tipped in favor of the two Democratic candidates, which gives Democrats, with Vice President Harris’ vote, a narrow majority in the Senate and that increases the odds of greater fiscal stimulus and a proposed infrastructure spending package.” “With those programs two things happen. One, there’s a chance that greater fiscal spending generates inflation. Two, there’s a high probability of greater long-duration Treasury supply. The usual supply-demand dynamics in the market mean that greater supply will push yields a little bit higher.” KEN POLCARI, MANAGING PARTNER, KACE CAPITAL ADVISORS, JUPITER, FLORIDA “It’s a re-positioning. I’ve been saying this for a couple of weeks, if there was a Democratic sweep the market has to reprice a little bit. It doesn’t mean it has to fall out of bed. A five percent or seven percent move lower is well within the normal trading band and wouldn’t be out of the question at all before the market finds stability. The market will figure it out but the path of least resistance is right now is lower before it goes higher. Five to seven percent is well within normal and actually it is probably very healthy if it does that anyway.” SEBASTIEN GALY, SENIOR MACRO STRATEGIST, NORDEA ASSET MANAGEMENT, LUXEMBOURG “We are trading as if Democrats have won both of the races, which mean more fiscal deficits and a steeper Treasury curve and there we enter into the psychological level of 1% in the 10-year treasury yield and that seems to have caused a significant move in growth (stocks). “Growth of course depends on the expectations that rates stay very low so the two are related phenomenally. It’s interesting because it shows that everybody expects that eventually we get a tapering and we get higher yields and of course growth is going to tank and value is going to outperform. We are seeing a preview of it right now. That’s the surprising message of the market.” “If Democrats hold both houses then there will be more pressure to regulate some of the bigger play within growth. Most of the (market) gains are concentrated in them and hence they are very sensitive to this.” JIM VOGEL, INTEREST RATE STRATEGIST, FHN FINANCIAL, MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE “There were a lot of people lined up to buy (Treasuries) if there was a blue wave election in November, and they got disappointed and instead it was the sellers at the long-end emphasizing TIPS purchases and all sorts of inflation-protection strategies that carried the day. Now you’re going to be dealing far more with fundamentals, and what’s the ‘real economy’ going to look like when we end 2021, as opposed to what might happen. All the things that fell into a ‘what if this happens,’ such as senate control changing, are now here and so we can start to deal with what’s here.” “I think the big thing is you could see easily another half a trillion in terms of direct aid to states. That idea has never died. I don’t know what the exact amount would be but it’s something on that order, which is real, versus where we were before the Georgia runoffs. But it’s not so big that it changes everything.” OLIVIER KONZEOUE, FX SALES TRADER, SAXO MARKETS, LONDON (email) “This means markets will anticipate more fiscal stimulus which could prop up inflation and mechanically push US interest rates higher but this also increases the prospect of more regulation imposed on technology companies as well as corporate tax hikes.“This could naturally drive interest rates-sensitive growth stocks lower, typically technology stocks, as NASDAQ Futures illustrate by extending losses to 2% this morning.“With 10-Year Treasury yields above 1% on expectations of a Democratic Senate and the Fed committed to support the market, the US Dollar would be expected to further tilt lower versus its main peers.” DAVID BAHNSEN, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, THE BAHNSEN GROUP, NEWPORT BEACH, CALIFORNIA (emailed) “I don’t expect major stock market implications surrounding a 50-50 tie in the Senate. While the Vice President’s vote means that a straight party line vote would belong to the Democrats, some of the market unfriendly policies that investors have been worried about in the event of a Blue Wave are still not going to come so easily. There are now three moderate Democrat Senators (most notably Joe Manchin of West Virginia) and House Democrats maintain a small lead.” “The Democrats’ small lead in both the Senate and the House will make it tougher than many believe to pass tax hikes, impose regulation and enact some of the other market unfriendly policies that investors have been worried about under a Blue Wave scenario.” “Investors should not be making any portfolio reallocations based off of the Georgia Senate results. If an investor’s asset allocation was to be substantially altered by a 50-50 Senate vs. a 51-49 Senate split, that asset allocation was never constructed well from the outset.” PETER CARDILLO, CHIEF MARKET ECONOMIST, SPARTAN CAPITAL SECURITIES, NEW YORK “It’s even if the Republicans should hold on to the Senate, it’s by a very slim margin. That means the Democrats can say it’s a victory. That means they have a better chance of passing legislation since they can always capture an independent or a more progressive Republican. “In the short term, it could be a catalyst to correct. The market is overbought and is looking for a catalyst to correct. And today’s election results is the perfect catalyst for the market to pull back. That doesn’t mean it’s going to happen immediately. “If you look what’s happening this morning financials, energy, sectors related to infrastructure are strong, and tech stocks are getting badly beaten. What is that suggesting? Taxes will probably go up and certain sectors of the market could get hit. What we’re seeing this morning is somewhat of a snapshot of what may be in store 3 to 6 months down the road.” GUY LEBAS, CHIEF FIXED INCOME STRATEGIST, JANNEY CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, PHILADELPHIA “The Georgia senatorial elections tipped in favor of the two Democratic candidates, which gives Democrats, with Vice President Harris’ vote, a narrow majority in the Senate and that increases the odds of greater fiscal stimulus and a proposed infrastructure spending package.” “With those programs two things happen.

0.03887309395846298," UPDATE 2-German bond yields rise to five-week high as U.S. yields jump on Georgia count * Georgia vote count fuels reflation trade * UST 10-yr yield above 1%; Bund yield at five-week high * Euro zone periphery govt bond yields tmsnrt.rs/2ii2Bqr (Updates levels) LONDON, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Germany’s 10-year bond yields rose to five-week highs on Wednesday, pushed up by a jump in U.S. Treasury yields as expectations rose that a win for Democrats in a Senate runoff race in Georgia may signal more fiscal spending. Democrats won one hotly contested U.S. Senate race in Georgia and pulled ahead in a second, edging closer to control of the chamber and the power to advance Democratic President-elect Joe Biden’s policy goals when he takes office this month. It was this scenario, suggesting further fiscal stimulus and inflation, that bond markets appeared to be betting on. Germany’s benchmark 10-year bond yield rose to -0.54% , its highest level in around five weeks. It was set for its biggest one-day jump in two weeks. Euro zone bond yields were broadly higher and UK gilt yields touched a two-week high, reflecting a trend in world bond markets led by U.S. bonds. The U.S. 10-year Treasury yield rose above 1% for the first time since March and was up 9.7 basis points on the day. The U.S. yield curve was at its steepest since 2017. A key market gauge of long-term inflation expectations in the euro area, meanwhile, rose to 1.2871% -- the highest level since early 2020. Bond strategists said the reflation trade evident in U.S. markets would likely be less pronounced in the euro area, where inflation was likely to be further depressed by weak economic activity, given renewed restrictions to contain the coronavirus. Indeed, economic activity in the bloc contracted more sharply than previously thought at the end of 2020. It could get worse as renewed lockdown restrictions hit the bloc’s dominant service industry, a survey showed. IHS Markit’s final December Composite Purchasing Managers’ Index, seen as a good gauge of economic health, rose to 49.1 from November’s 45.3 but was below a flash reading of 49.8. Anything below 50 indicates contraction. “For euro zone rates, there is an underlying tension between the recovery in traded inflation indicators and the near-term gloom that followed extensions of lockdown restrictions across the continent, most recently in the UK and Germany,” said Antoine Bouvet, a senior rates strategist at ING. “We find it hard to justify further rises given the lack of a Fed-style commitment to let inflation run above the previously understood target from the European Central Bank.” The ECB targets inflation near 2%. Its monetary policy remit is currently under review."
0.03887309395846298," German bond yields rise to five-week high as U.S. yields jump on Georgia count * Euro zone periphery govt bond yields tmsnrt.rs/2ii2Bqr LONDON, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Germany’s 10-year bond yields rose to their highest in almost five weeks on Wednesday, pushed up by a jump in U.S. Treasury yields, on expectations that a win for Democrats in a Senate runoff race in Georgia may signal more fiscal spending. Democratic challenger Raphael Warnock won a hotly contested U.S. Senate race in Georgia over Republican incumbent Kelly Loeffler, TV networks and Edison Research projected. A second runoff remains undecided, leaving control of the Senate up in the air. Democrats must win both contests to take control of the Senate, lifting the prospect of more fiscal stimulus and inflation -- a scenario that bond markets appeared to betting on. As the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield rose above 1% for the first time since March, with the yield curve at its steepest since 2017, Europe’s borrowing headed higher in early trade. In Germany, the euro area’s benchmark issuer, 10-year bond yields rose to -0.53% -- their highest in almost five weeks. Most 10-year year bond yields across the euro zone were up around 4 to 5 basis points on the day. UK gilt yields touched a two-week high, a sign of the broader trend in world bond markets. “If market expectations of a double Democrat win in Georgia are confirmed, gains above 1% should be maintained,” analysts at ING said, referring to the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield. “But it will feel more palatable later in Q1 when the worst of the Covid impact is behind us.” Bond strategists said the reflation trade evident in U.S. bond markets would probably be less pronounced in the euro area, where inflation was likely to be further depressed by weak economic activity, given renewed restrictions to contain the coronavirus."
-0.33388529210948303," U.S. Treasury-led report calls for overhaul of money market funds U.S. policymakers need to consider major changes to make money market funds less vulnerable to investor runs, a working group led by the Treasury Department said Tuesday, stopping short of making specific recommendations. The regulatory group laid out several potential changes to those markets, which the U.S. government intervened to stabilize after big outflows prompted by the U.S. coronavirus outbreak in March. Ideas included setting stricter rules around fund redemptions, or higher capital buffers for such funds, but the group said it was not favoring any specific approach, and simply wanted to spur discussion. ""The events of March 2020 show that more work is needed to reduce the risk that structural vulnerabilities ... will lead to or exacerbate stresses in short-term funding markets,"" stated the report by the Presidential Working Group on Financial Markets. The report could kick off a broader effort to overhaul the funds. Former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen, whom President-Elect Joe Biden has tapped to lead his Treasury Department, is expected to review of so-called ""shadow banking,"" which includes such funds, analysts said. In March, short-term funding seized up with a massive sell-off in U.S. markets, including Treasuries. Among institutional and retail prime money market funds, which allow daily redemptions while holding less liquid short-term assets, outflows as a percentage of fund assets exceeded that of the September 2008 crisis. The crunch prompted the Fed to buy $1.6 trillion in Treasuries and other bonds to stabilize the markets. It continues to buy around $80 billion monthly. Top officials have warnedthat liquidity could collapse again if that support is withdrawn. read more"
0.0886760730334052," Trump's final trade jab may be tariffs on Vietnamese goods - experts WASHINGTON/HANOI (Reuters) -President Donald Trump is likely to unveil proposed tariffs on Vietnamese goods before he leaves office in January, currency and trade experts say, after the U.S. Treasury branded the growing U.S. trade partner a “currency manipulator” last week. U.S. companies that import goods from Vietnam should brace for significant tariffs from the U.S. Trade Representative’s (USTR) “Section 301” investigation into currency valuation practices, experts say. Results of the probe, running in parallel with the Treasury review announced last week, could be public as soon as Jan. 7. “It is wise to be planning now for the conclusion of the Section 301 process because, especially with the Treasury designation, it is extremely likely that the United States will impose some kind of retaliation against Vietnam,” said Deborah Elms, executive director of the Singapore-based Asian Trade Centre. U.S. companies imported about $65 billion worth of goods from Vietnam in the first 10 months of 2020, compared with $66.6 billion for all of 2019. Tariffs could hit the $400 billion-plus sales U.S. apparel and footwear sector, along with furniture, electronics and household goods. “There will be economic consequences,” Elms told a Friday web event hosted by the American Chamber of Commerce in Vietnam. Deadly foes during the Vietnam War in the 1960s and early 1970s, Vietnam and the United States have enjoyed significantly warmer relations in recent years. Washington had considered Hanoi a strategic security and economic partner in Southeast Asia to help counter China’s growing influence, including during the Trump administration, but tariffs would deal the relationship a setback. Vietnam’s commerce ministry said on Monday that tariffs would cause firms in the country to “lose their confidence in doing businesses with U.S. partners” and reduce imports from the United States. It said officials from the two countries will hold “extremely important” talks in late December. Taxing Vietnamese imports would present yet another trade complication for President-elect Joe Biden as he takes over, and could prompt retaliatory tariffs on U.S. exports to Vietnam. Trump has thrown up new economic restrictions on China in recent weeks, including adding the top Chinese chipmaker SMIC and drone maker SZ DJI Technology to a technology blacklist on Friday. A spokesman for Biden’s transition team did not respond to questions about the Vietnam investigation or Treasury’s findings. A USTR spokesman also did not respond. The Treasury’s long-delayed currency report, published Dec. 16, concluded that Vietnam, along with Switzerland, had exceeded all three of its thresholds for currency manipulation during the year ending June 30. Both countries had foreign exchange market interventions and global current account surpluses exceeding 2% of gross domestic product (GDP), and a $20 billion-plus trade surplus with the United States. The designation adds fuel to the USTR's Section 301 investigation into Vietnam's ""acts, policies, and practices that may contribute to the undervaluation of its currency,"" hurting U.S. commerce. The USTR has Dec. 28-29 public hearings here on the investigation and a second one into whether Vietnamese manufacturers use illegally harvested timber. Three sources familiar with the matter said the USTR would not cut short a public comment period that ends Jan. 7, giving Trump about two weeks to act on any Vietnam tariff recommendations before he leaves office on Jan. 20. Tariff collections could start in Biden’s first weeks in the White House. “This administration clearly has a beef here and wants to send a signal that Vietnam needs to be brushed back for its currency policies,” said Matthew Goodman, a former Treasury official and an Asian economics expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The message is that the United States will not tolerate Vietnam using an artificially low currency to aid its development in the same the way that China undervalued its currency for decades, Goodman said, adding that he views Vietnam’s high current account surplus as a temporary phenomenon. USTR used a similar Section 301 investigation to justify tariffs of up to 25% on $370 billion worth of Chinese imports in Trump’s 2.5-year trade war with Beijing. It is unclear whether tariffs on Vietnamese goods would reach that level or be closer to the 6.2% to 10% duties that Commerce Department applied to Vietnamese tires in November under a new currency rule. Analysts say that Vietnam’s violation of the Treasury current account surplus threshold was partly a product of the Trump administration’s trade war with China, causing a rush of inward investment by companies seeking to avoid Chinese tariffs and a large increase in exports to the United States. Concerned U.S. executives are already reaching out to Congress. “Just the rumor of another massive tax on American companies has created such a panic that congressional offices are already getting panicked calls from their hometown businesses,” one congressional aide told Reuters. In comments submitted for the USTR currency investigation, the American Apparel and Footwear Association said Vietnam “has become even more important as U.S. companies have implemented diversification strategies away from China. Imposing new punitive tariffs on imports from Vietnam would cause extreme disruption.”"

1.7612809144407902," Asian countries, Switzerland at risk in U.S. Treasury's currency report The Trump administration labeled Switzerland and Vietnam currency manipulators on Wednesday, in another parting shot at trading partners that could complicate matters for U.S. President-elect Joe Biden's incoming team. In a long-overdue report, the U.S. Treasury also added India, Thailand and Taiwan to a list of trading partners it says may be deliberately devaluing their currencies against the dollar. The COVID-19 pandemic has skewed trade flows and widened U.S. deficits with trading partners, an irritant to outgoing President Donald Trump, who won office four years ago partly on a promise to close the U.S. trade gap. The Swiss National Bank said it does not manipulate its currency and ""remains willing to intervene more strongly in the foreign exchange market"". read more Vietnam's central bank said it would work with U.S. authorities to ensure a ""harmonious and fair"" trade relationship. ""Vietnam's foreign exchange rate policy has for years been managed in a way to contain inflation, ensure macro stability and not to create unfair trade advantage,"" the State Bank of Vietnam said in a statement. The manipulator labels will ramp up pressure on Biden before he takes over, Per Hammered, chief emerging markets strategist at SEB in Stockholm, said. ""You set the agenda and force him (Biden) into positions that he will have to get out of somehow,"" Hammered said. A U.S. Treasury official said Biden's transition team had not been briefed, adding: ""They are not implicated in this."" U.S. Treasury Secretary nominee Janet Yellen could alter the findings in her first currency report, which is due in April. A spokesman for Biden's team did not respond to a request for comment. The President-elect's team has been critical of other moves by U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, including ending some Federal Reserve pandemic lending programs. Mnuchin said in a statement that the Treasury ""has taken a strong step today to safeguard economic growth and opportunity for American workers and businesses."" China, labeled by Mnuchin as a currency manipulator in August 2019 at the height of trade tensions, was kept on the Treasury's monitoring list due to its high trade surplus with the United States. Mnuchin lifted the designation in January, two days before the world's two largest economies signed a ""Phase 1"" trade deal. TRADE ADVANTAGE Countries must at least have a $20 billion-plus bilateral trade surplus with the United States, foreign currency intervention exceeding 2% of gross domestic product and a global current account surplus exceeding 2% of GDP to be labeled a manipulator. Vietnam and Switzerland far exceeded these criteria, with foreign exchange interventions of 5% and 14% of GDP respectively. (See FACTBOX read more ) The report said that at least part of Vietnam's intervention was aimed at pushing down the dong for a trade advantage, while at least part of Switzerland's action was aimed at pushing down the Swiss franc to prevent effective balance of payments adjustments. Mark Sobel, a former Treasury and International Monetary Fund (IMF) official, said the manipulator designations were ""mechanistic"" interpretations of the thresholds that ignored subtleties and extenuating circumstances. These include safe-haven inflows into Switzerland's currency due to the pandemic and a rush of foreign investment into Vietnam in 2019, fueled by U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. The IMF has forecast that Vietnam's current account surplus will fall below the 2% of GDP threshold for 2020. ""They're missing some more obvious cases of harmful currency practices,"" said Sobel, adding that Taiwan and Thailand, which narrowly missed the intervention thresholds, ""have been intervening heavily for years."" The Treasury official said the United States will seek negotiations with Switzerland and Vietnam to bring them back below the manipulation thresholds and declined to speculate on whether the process could lead to U.S. tariffs on their goods. Among remedies specified in U.S. laws governing the currency report are limiting offending countries' access to government procurement contracts and to development finance. Vietnam could be hit with tariffs under a separate probe by the U.S. Trade Representative's office into the causes of an undervalued dong that could be influenced by the Treasury report. Some business leaders fear Trump could act before a late December hearing on the issue, but a source familiar with the matter said that appeared unlikely. read more Taiwan said its currency policies were aimed at stability and that it hopes to cut its trade surplus with the United States to address U.S. concerns. read more Thailand said its addition to the monitoring list would have no big impact. The label briefly lifted the value of the Swiss franc against a broadly soft dollar . Forex strategists said the move may make it slightly more difficult for the SNB to intervene, but the easing of the coronavirus pandemic would reduce upward pressure on the franc. read more The Thai baht leapt to a seven-year peak as investors reckoned Thailand's central bank might ease off its baht selling. The dong inched up to a two-week high and the Taiwan dollar made a new 23-year peak. EMRG/FRX The additions of India, Thailand and Taiwan leave the Treasury monitoring list at 10, with China, Japan, South Korea, German, Italy, Singapore and Malaysia already on it. Vietnam and Switzerland were upgraded and Ireland was removed. The report said that India and Singapore had intervened in the foreign exchange market in an ""asymmetric manner"" but did not meet other requirements to warrant a manipulator label."
1.0077002112031057," U.S. Treasury labels Switzerland, Vietnam as currency manipulators WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury labeled Switzerland and Vietnam as currency manipulators on Wednesday and added three new names to a watch list of countries it suspects of taking measures to devalue their currencies against the dollar. In what may be one of the final broadsides to international trading partners delivered by the departing administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, the Treasury said that through June 2020 both Switzerland and Vietnam had intervened in currency markets to prevent effective balance of payments adjustments. Furthermore, in its semi-annual currency manipulation report, the Treasury said Vietnam had acted to gain “unfair competitive advantage in international trade as well.” Foreign exchange analysts had broadly anticipated the U.S. Treasury designation for the two countries. The action comes as the global coronavirus pandemic skews trade flows and widens U.S. deficits with trading partners, an irritant to Trump, who won office four years ago partly on a promise to close the U.S. trade gap. To be labeled a manipulator, countries must at least have a $20 billion-plus bilateral trade surplus with the United States, foreign currency intervention exceeding 2% of gross domestic product and a global current account surplus exceeding 2% of GDP. The U.S. Treasury also said its “monitoring list” of countries that meet some of the criteria has grown to 10 with the additions of Taiwan, Thailand and India. Others on the list include China, Japan, Korea, Germany, Italy, Singapore and Malaysia. The U.S. Treasury report also said that India and Singapore had intervened in the foreign exchange market in a “sustained, asymmetric manner” but did not meet other requirements to warrant designation as manipulators."
1.0077002112031057," UPDATE 1-Sudan welcomes U.S. move to clear $1 bln in arrears to World Bank (Adds background) CAIRO, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Sudan’s finance ministry said on Wednesday that it welcomed the U.S. Treasury’s move to clear $1 billion in Sudanese arrears to the World Bank after its removal from Washington’s list of terrorism sponsors. The move allows Sudan to access $1.5 billion annually in funds from the International Development Association (IDA), which is an arm of the World Bank. Sudan’s presence on the list had cut it off from much-needed financial assistance and foreign investment in the midst of an economic crisis marked by shortages in wheat and fuel. Acting finance minister Heba Ahmed said on Monday that the U.S. Export-Import Bank would also provide guarantees to American investors from the private sector that could initially total $1 billion, after Washington removed Sudan from its list of state sponsors of terrorism. Ahmed also said U.S. support would extend to the provision of wheat and other commodities over four years.

0.42369572401384675," U.S. tariffs over currency issue would harm ties with Vietnam -U.S. Chamber WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Chamber of Commerce urged the U.S. government on Tuesday not to impose tariffs on Vietnam over the alleged undervaluation of its currency, saying Vietnam did not meet the U.S. Treasury’s three-part test for unfair currency practices. In a blog post and an interview, U.S. Chamber officials said any move by the United States to slap tariffs on Vietnam ahead of a late December hearing would ignore established procedures. “It would send a bad message to Vietnam and it would have a real and consequential impact on the bilateral relationship,” John Goyer, the chamber’s executive director for Southeast Asia, said in an interview. “Rash tariff action will be damaging to the overall relationship.” Currency experts expect U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to issue a report on the foreign currency practices of major trading partners within days. Industry sources say Washington could slap tariffs on Vietnam afterwards. The U.S. Treasury earlier this year determined that the Vietnamese currency was undervalued in 2019 by about 4.7% against the dollar due in part to government intervention, according to an assessment sent to the U.S. Commerce Department. In October, it set in process a motion that could result in U.S. tariffs on billions of dollars of imports from Vietnam. Vietnam, already on Washington’s watch list of alleged currency manipulators, has come under scrutiny for its trade surplus with the United States, a highly positive current account balance and a perception that its central bank has been active in terms of net foreign exchange purchases. In a blog post, John Murphy, the U.S. Chamber’s senior vice president for international policy, said Vietnam had not met two of the U.S. Treasury’s three tests for assessing whether a country was engaging in unfair currency practices. Vietnam did meet the third test due to its trade surplus, but that was largely due to U.S. imposition of Section 301 tariffs on more than $350 billion of Chinese imports and a scramble by U.S. firms to find other suppliers, Murphy said."
0.6735164880209595," Suspected Russian hackers spied on U.S. Treasury emails - sources WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hackers believed to be working for Russia have been monitoring internal email traffic at the U.S. Treasury and Commerce departments, according to people familiar with the matter, adding they feared the hacks uncovered so far may be the tip of the iceberg. The hack is so serious it led to a National Security Council meeting at the White House on Saturday, said one of the people familiar with the matter. U.S. officials have not said much publicly beyond the Commerce Department confirming there was a breach at one of its agencies and that they asked the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and the FBI to investigate. National Security Council spokesman John Ullyot added that they “are taking all necessary steps to identify and remedy any possible issues related to this situation.” The U.S. government has not publicly identified who might be behind the hacking, but three of the people familiar with the investigation said Russia is currently believed to be responsible for the attack. Two of the people said that the breaches are connected to a broad campaign that also involved the recently disclosed hack on FireEye, a major U.S. cybersecurity company with government and commercial contracts. In a statement posted here to Facebook, the Russian foreign ministry described the allegations as another unfounded attempt by the U.S. media to blame Russia for cyberattacks against U.S. agencies. The cyber spies are believed to have gotten in by surreptitiously tampering with updates released by IT company SolarWinds, which serves government customers across the executive branch, the military, and the intelligence services, according to two people familiar with the matter. The trick - often referred to as a “supply chain attack” - works by hiding malicious code in the body of legitimate software updates provided to targets by third parties. In a statement released late Sunday, the Austin, Texas-based company said that updates to its monitoring software released between March and June of this year may have been subverted by what it described as a “highly-sophisticated, targeted and manual supply chain attack by a nation state.” The company declined to offer any further detail, but the diversity of SolarWind’s customer base has sparked concern within the U.S. intelligence community that other government agencies may be at risk, according to four people briefed on the matter. SolarWinds says on its website that its customers include most of America’s Fortune 500 companies, the top 10 U.S. telecommunications providers, all five branches of the U.S. military, the State Department, the National Security Agency, and the Office of President of the United States. ‘HUGE CYBER ESPIONAGE CAMPAIGN’ The breach presents a major challenge to the incoming administration of President-elect Joe Biden as officials investigate what information was stolen and try to ascertain what it will be used for. It is not uncommon for large scale cyber investigations to take months or years to complete. “This is a much bigger story than one single agency,” said one of the people familiar with the matter. “This is a huge cyber espionage campaign targeting the U.S. government and its interests.” Hackers broke into the NTIA’s office software, Microsoft’s Office 365. Staff emails at the agency were monitored by the hackers for months, sources said. A Microsoft spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment. Neither did a spokesman for the Treasury Department. The hackers are “highly sophisticated” and have been able to trick the Microsoft platform’s authentication controls, according to a person familiar with the incident, who spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not allowed to speak to the press. “This is a nation state,” said a different person briefed on the matter. The full scope of the breach is unclear. The investigation is still its early stages and involves a range of federal agencies, including the FBI, according to three of the people familiar with the matter. A spokesperson for the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency said they have been “working closely with our agency partners regarding recently discovered activity on government networks. CISA is providing technical assistance to affected entities as they work to identify and mitigate any potential compromises.” The FBI and U.S. National Security Agency did not respond to a request for comment. There is some indication that the email compromise at NTIA dates back to this summer, although it was only recently discovered, according to a senior U.S. official."
0.6735795781434777," Euro climbs as ECB adds stimulus, U.S. stocks slip NEW YORK (Reuters) -The euro rose on Thursday as the European Central Bank rolled out yet more stimulus measures to lift the currency bloc out of a double-dip recession, while the S&P 500 ended slightly lower following an increase in weekly U.S. jobless claims. Energy shares were sharply higher, with oil prices climbing nearly 3% and Brent rising above $50 a barrel for the first time since early March, fueled by hopes of a faster demand recovery. The ECB expanded its debt purchase scheme and agreed to provide banks with even more ultra-cheap liquidity as long as they keep passing the cash onto companies. It said it is monitoring the euro’s exchange rate with regard to its possible implications for the medium-term inflation outlook. Strategists said the level of the measures may ensure that current monetary accommodation will be extended well into 2022. Sterling weakened as investors became more cautious about the risk of a no-deal Brexit. The euro was up 0.49% to $1.214, while sterling was last trading at $1.3295, down 0.75% on the day. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 and Dow ended lower as the jump in jobless claims pointed to a stalling labor market recovery, though focus remained on stimulus talks. A U.S. Senate vote on a stopgap measure to keep the government running could slip to the Friday deadline, as a top Democrat suggested wrangling over a spending package and coronavirus aid could drag on through Christmas. “We are in a bit of a trough, we’ve hit a valley right now and it’s all based on accelerating through this,” said Phil Blancato, CEO of Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management in New York. “We need that announcement, without that announcement we are going to have volatility through the end of the year, without a doubt.” The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 69.55 points, or 0.23%, to 29,999.26, the S&P 500 lost 4.72 points, or 0.13%, to 3,668.1 and the Nasdaq Composite added 66.86 points, or 0.54%, to 12,405.81. The pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.44% and MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 0.03%.

0.6735795781434777," Mnuchin says next U.S. Treasury secretary should sell $700 million YRC loan WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Thursday he would recommend that his successor next year consider selling the $700 million emergency government loan made to trucking company YRC Worldwide at a profit for taxpayers. Mnuchin, speaking to a congressional oversight commission on federal coronavirus aid programs, said the loan to YRC, which hauls goods for the Defense Department, “was a risky loan.” “We’ve been fortunate that the economy recovered, and that the equity is doing well and I am going to recommend that next year, whoever is Treasury secretary seriously look at selling this loan and recovering what I think will be a profit to taxpayers because this was a success,” Mnuchin said. The $700 million loan to YRC, which reported a net loss of $104 million in 2019, came with a 30% equity stake in the trucking firm. It was the largest and most controversial of 11 loans made from a $17 billion coronavirus rescue fund that was initially intended to bail out large defense contractors such as Boeing Co and General Electric Co. Mnuchin has since closed the program to new loans and is asking Congress to reallocate unused funds for aid to small businesses, municipalities, individuals and schools. Members of the bipartisan Congressional Oversight Commission established under the $2 trillion CARES Act grilled Mnuchin on the decision to make the loan to YRC, a company that has been frequently in financial difficulty. Mnuchin, who has not publicly acknowledged that he will be succeeded by President-elect Joe Biden’s Treasury nominee, Janet Yellen, said the Treasury made the loan to protect Defense Department operations and to protect thousands of jobs that would be lost if the company failed. Mnuchin added that if he was still in charge of his former bank, OneWest, he would have rejected YRC’s application as a commercial loan. “But as you recall both Congress and outsiders encouraged us to take losses,” he said. YRC’s shares were trading at $5.50 on Thursday, up from $1.85 on June 30, the day before the Treasury loan was announced. Mnuchin was also asked by commission member Bharat Ramamurti, an attorney and former Democratic Senate aide, whether he was aware that one of YRC’s largest creditors, Apollo Global Management, had “close personal ties” to White House adviser Jared Kushner, including a $184 million loan to the Kushner Companies. Kushner is the son-in-law of President Donald Trump. Mnuchin said he was not directly aware of this and did not take it into account in approving the loan. He added that neither Kushner nor anyone on Kushner’s staff reached out to Mnuchin about a loan to YRC."
4.319178296301524," Lebanon central bank can keep subsidies for only two more months - governor BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon’s central bank can keep basic subsidies for only two more months and the state should come up with a plan, Governor Riad Salameh said on Tuesday as the country’s financial crisis spirals. He told Saudi’s al-Hadath TV the central bank would commit to providing Lebanese government accounts for a forensic audit, but that disclosing those of domestic banks would require a change in legislation. A meltdown without precedent has crashed Lebanon’s currency, paralyzed banks and sent inflation soaring. As dollar inflows dried up, the central bank has used dwindling reserves to provide foreign currency for key imports - fuel, wheat and medicine - and some basic goods. Suggestions of a looming end to subsidies have triggered panic buying and fears of rising hunger. The crisis had made over half the population poor. “We have the capacity to keep the subsidies for two months,” Salameh said on Tuesday. “This question should also be asked of those in charge of the country,” he said about the subsidies. He added that lawmakers would meet this week to start drafting a plan. Foreign donors have demanded a forensic audit of the central bank among key reforms before helping Lebanon out of the crisis, rooted in decades of waste and graft. But restructuring consultancy Alvarez & Marsal said it withdrew from the audit because it had not received information required. Some Lebanese officials have accused Salameh of using bank secrecy laws to justify withholding information. Salameh said he was for an audit but local banks’ accounts could not be revealed without some laws being amended. The central bank would seek to reorganize and sell Lebanese banks that fail to raise capital, he said. He has said those that cannot increase their capital by 20% by the end of February 2021 will have to leave the market. In response to a question about the possibility of U.S. sanctions, Salameh said the bank was doing everything necessary within the law and “in constant coordination with the U.S. Treasury.” Washington has in recent months sanctioned Lebanese officials on charges of corruption or enabling Iran-backed Hezbollah."
4.319178296301524," GLOBAL MARKETS-Global equity markets jump, bonds dip, on hopes of vaccine-led recovery (New throughout, updates prices, market activity and comments through close of U.S. trading) NEW YORK, Dec 1 (Reuters) - Stock markets rose and safe havens such as U.S. Treasury bonds dipped Tuesday as strong factory data and signs that coronavirus vaccinations could be administered by the end of the year helped prolong a worldwide rally in risk assets even as the pandemic accelerated. Bets on more easing from the U.S. Federal Reserve to help the economy through the winter weighed on the dollar as riskier currencies rose. Crude prices fell after oil-producing countries delayed a decision on output cuts. Pfizer Inc said it had asked for emergency European Union authorization of its vaccine after a similar move in the United States last month. On Monday, Moderna Inc applied for U.S. authorization after full results from a late-stage study showed it was 94.1% effective with no serious safety concerns. “We believe the rally can continue, with the current pipeline of expected vaccine rollouts, in line with our central scenario of widespread availability in the second quarter of 2021,” said Mark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management in Zurich. MSCI’s gauge of stocks across the globe gained 1.16% following broad gains in Europe and Asia, with Japan’s Nikkei closing near a 29-1/2-year high. China’s blue-chip CSI300 index rose 2.2% after a business survey showed factory activity accelerated at the fastest pace in a decade in November. In the UK last month, factories recorded their fastest growth in almost three years, a survey showed. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 185.28 points, or 0.63%, to 29,823.92, the S&P 500 gained 40.82 points, or 1.13%, to 3,662.45 and the Nasdaq Composite added 156.37 points, or 1.28%, to 12,355.11. In November, breakthroughs in vaccine developments from Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca along with a market-friendly outcome of the U.S. presidential election helped the MSCI world stock index score its biggest monthly rise on record, up 12% to new all-time peaks. Coronavirus cases have touched multimonth highs in South Korea, Hong Kong and Europe over the last week, while the United States posted a record 4.2 million new cases in November. “What we are seeing today is that upward trend reasserting itself, given the positive news on the vaccine front, China’s growth picking up, and the tremendous faith in the ability of central banks to keep the markets afloat,” said Stephen Miller, market strategist for GSFM Funds Management. In foreign exchange markets, the dollar fell a day after closing November with its biggest monthly loss since July and investors bracing for more U.S. monetary easing. In a speech released late on Monday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said a slowing recovery and a surging pandemic meant the United States was entering a “challenging” few months, with the potential deployment of a vaccine still facing hurdles. Benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury notes last fell 24/32 in price to yield 0.9194%, from 0.842% late on Monday, as Congress began a two-week sprint to secure funding and avoid a possible government shutdown. Oil prices fell after leading producers delayed talks on 2021 output policy, while the pandemic kept sapping fuel demand. U.S. crude fell 1.68% to $44.58 per barrel and Brent was at $47.38, down 1.04% on the day."
4.319178296301524," Corporate defaults a rising risk for 2021: Russell Investments global head of fixed income LONDON (Reuters) - Corporate defaults are a growing risk for next year, although central bank stimulus and a COVID-19 vaccine will provide support, Russell Investments’ global head of fixed income said on Monday. “You’ve got the vaccine news, you’ve got the stimulus in the background, you’ve got low interest rates,” Gerard Fitzpatrick told the Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit. “On the flip side, there is definitely a rising risk relating to default risk. We’re not out of the woods relating to COVID. It’s clearly having an impact on the economy and some sectors.” The coronavirus shock will more than double company default rates across the United States and Europe over the next 9 months, ratings agency S&P Global said last month, predicting U.S. corporate default rates at 12.5%. Europe’s rate would surge to 8.5% from 3.8%, it said. Fitzpatrick, who helps to manage almost $300 billion in assets, said he had reduced some of the credit overweight he had taken on in March. “The delta of the stimulus being behind us, and the default risk being ahead, means now’s the time to be a bit more conservative,” he said. Fitzpatrick expects central bank policy support to cap any bond sell-off, with 10-year U.S. government borrowing costs unlikely to rise more than 50 basis points, from the current 0.86%. “A 50 bps increase from here would take us to 1.30-1.40%, if it (any selling) were to escalate further, you would get more of a repeat of the market volatility we got with the taper tantrum one, which wasn’t good, nobody wants that,” Fitzpatrick said, referring to sell-offs triggered by hints of stimulus pullback. He reckons U.S. yields could fall further and is overweight Treasuries over German Bunds, betting on a compression in the yield gap. Inflation is also on his list of risks to watch next year. “I think it’s a low risk, but the severity would be high, if it did happen,” Fitzpatrick said. “And the low risk, I think, is because of that control from central banks, and you’ve got to put your money there for or against central banks.” Fitzpatrick also said for next year he expected: * The European recovery fund to be a net positive for governments * Weight of cbank stimulus will keep yields low * Low growth but some growth a theme for next year Follow Reuters Summits on Twitter @Reuters_Summits (This story corrects title in headline and first paragraph, no other changes to text)"
4.319178296301524," U.S. debt, Fed easy money biggest risks in 2021: Jim Rogers (Reuters) - The debt taken on by the U.S. government and the unprecedented amount of money printed by the Federal Reserve are the biggest risks for 2021, Jim Rogers, the investor who co-founded the Quantum Fund with George Soros, said on Monday. Rogers, who is Chairman at Rogers Holdings and Beeland Interests in Singapore, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum he expected the next decade to be the most difficult for markets in his lifetime because of the levels of global debt. “We had a horrible time in 2008 because of too much debt, and since 2008, the debt everywhere has skyrocketed. We can’t even count how much the debt is up,” Rogers said at the Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit 2020. Rogers said he expected the U.S. central bank to continue printing and spending more money under the Democratic administration led by President-elect Joe Biden. Biden is expected to nominate former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen as U.S. Treasury secretary. “If Janet Yellen is the next Secretary of the Treasury, she loves to print and spend money,” Rogers said. Taking a contrarian view, Rogers said he was not bearish on the U.S. dollar after its correction and on its safe haven appeal. “There are many bears right now, which usually leads to a rally; so, I’m not bearish on the U.S. dollar,” he said. Bets against the U.S. dollar were expected to linger or even increase in the aftermath of the Nov. 3 presidential election, a Reuters poll found. Rogers said he was not buying gold or silver at current prices, but was looking at declines in both precious metals to add to his portfolio. He was one of the earliest investors to predict the boom in commodities in the early-2000s. “Silver is much cheaper than gold on a historical basis. I will buy both (silver and gold), but I will buy more silver.” For other news from Reuters Global Investment Outlook Summit 2021, click here Follow Reuters Summits on Twitter @Reuters_Summits (This interview was conducted in the Reuters Global Markets Forum, a chat room hosted on the Refinitiv Messenger platform.

4.5962203881513135," GLOBAL MARKETS-Stocks touch record high as investors cheer Biden transition, vaccines * MSCI’s all-country world index hits record high * European shares approach nine-month peak before pulling back * Wall Street futures fall * Risk-sensitive currencies supported, bitcoin near record * 2020 asset performance tmsnrt.rs/2yaDPgn * Global stock market outlook: tmsnrt.rs/3nT0J5r LONDON, Nov 25 (Reuters) - Global shares on Wednesday hit record highs and were on course for their best month ever, with investors cheering the prospect of a smooth handover of power after the U.S. presidential election and confident COVID-19 vaccines would soon be ready. President-elect Joe Biden on Tuesday introduced his foreign policy and national security team, after President Donald Trump cleared the way to prepare for the start of his administration. Reports that Biden planned to nominate former Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen as Treasury Secretary, potentially easing the passage of a fiscal-stimulus package to counter COVID-19 damage, also cheered markets. The renewed demand for shares pushed MSCI’s broadest gauge of world stocks to a record high of 622.12. It was last trading flat, on course for a record monthly gain. The Euro STOXX 600 TOXX> made early gains to near nine-month highs before pulling back 0.3%, with autos and banks weighing. Futures for the S&P 500 turned lower ahead of the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday. On Tuesday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Tuesday on Tuesday had cracked 30,000 for the first time. “The world is going to look a lot better this time next year than it does now, and that’s what equity markets are reflecting,” said Mike Bell, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management. “The fact is the outlook has dramatically changed in the last month.” The rally for global stocks is set to continue for at least six months, a Reuters poll forecast on Wednesday. Optimism around vaccine developments and expectations of a recovery in corporate confidence and profitability should also push European stocks to near record highs next year, a separate Reuters survey found. Earlier, Japan’s Nikkei rose to a 29-year high, though analysts and fund managers polled by Reuters foresaw a correction in the near term. MSCI’s index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan fell 0.4%, with Chinese shares capped by worries about rising debt defaults. Investors bet that forthcoming virus vaccines would help the industries hit hardest by the pandemic, from tourism to energy. Global energy shares have risen almost 34% so far this month, on track for their best month on record as crude prices rally. Oil prices held near their highest levels since March on the improved global economic outlook. Brent futures were up 1.2% to $48.42 per barrel, touching a high last seen in March. Risk-on moves played out in bond markets, too. Yields on benchmark euro zone debt rose from record lows, with German Bund yields edged to near their highest levels in almost a week. Yields rise when bond prices fall. U.S. Treasuries were pressured, too, as investors bet any fiscal stimulus package in Washington would bring more debt. Riskier currencies gained against safe havens, though the under-pressure dollar showed resilience as the morning went on. The Australian dollar moved to its highest since early September, already helped by investors unwinding bets on additional monetary easing. Against a basket of six currencies, the dollar turned positive, gaining 0.1% at 92.224 after falling 0.4% on Tuesday. The dollar is still expected to fall further as progress on a vaccine and the expected choice of Yellen as the next U.S. Treasury secretary relieved two big uncertainties for investors. The euro fell against the dollar, and was last down 0.1% at $1.18835. Bitcoin edged up 0.8% to $19,1420, staying within sight of its record peak of $19,666 after notching gains of nearly 40% in November alone."
4.5962203881513135," Column: Risk pricing needs rethink into 2021 LONDON (Reuters) - Risk gauges in financial markets may be askew as they struggle to price a potentially messy end to a truly shocking 2020 while simultaneously assuming clear blue sky on the horizon. As 2021’s big market calls stream in with some eye-popping forecasts circulating, there’s a sense investors remain too cautious on record high stocks and perhaps too sanguine on government bonds with yields cosseted at less than 1% out to 10 years. Despite expectations of further Wall St stock gains of 20% or more over the next year or two, equity volatility measures are still much higher relative to the past couple of decades than historically subdued bond market equivalents. Wall St’s “fear gauge”, the VIX index of 30-day implied volatility in the S&P500, has ebbed from pre-U.S. election highs and is less than a quarter of the raging March peak as the virus exploded. But it’s still some 20% above its mean since 2005 - a period that takes in whirlwinds surrounding this pandemic and the Great Financial Crisis of 2007/08. The U.S. Treasury bond market’s equivalent index, the MOVE, is by contrast now almost 50% below its mean over the same 15-year period. The Federal Reserve’s expected suppression of borrowing rates close to likely floor near zero largely explains the bond side of that picture, with post-election government gridlock expected to rein in more extreme fiscal spending speculation. That said, the confidence is impressive given the Federal Reserve has so far eschewed any formal government yield cap and has stopped short to date of extending the maturity of its bond buying programmes to longer-dated issues. But if bond markets’ assumption of subdued Treasury volatility going forward proves true, then implied equity caution is even more puzzling - not least given the outsize forecasts being clocked for the S&P500 over the coming year. Both banking giants JPMorgan and Goldman Sachs now forecast the S&P500 to gain a further 25% at least over the next two years - with JPM seeing that possible by the end of this year. While a gain of 25% would still be less that 2019’s full-year surge, there have only been 10 other years since 1970 that have managed gains of more than 25%. And next year it will most likely be starting close to record highs. “AWFULLY MISPRICED” Citi analysts describe the behaviour of equity and bond market volatility as an “interesting medium-term dynamic” that should rectify gradually as the recovery kicks in next year. “We view next year as being a positive backdrop for equities with potential for further curve steepening,” they wrote. “Historically, such an environment sees fixed income volatility rise while equity volatility is flat or falls.” Morgan Stanley concurs on the Treasury side at least and their rationale perhaps squares the circle to some degree. Forecasting a boom in nominal U.S. gross domestic product growth next year of 7.5% as vaccines kick in, they claim that 10-year Treasury yield of 1% for next 12 months looks “awfully mispriced”. What’s more, even many of the economists who do expect the Fed to conduct either an explicit or implicit yield cap policy don’t expect it to draw the line until 10-year rates hit 1.50% at least - almost twice where they are at the moment. Morgan Stanley reckons this bond risk has significant implications for the valuation of “long duration” sectors such as technology stocks so beloved during the pandemic lockdowns. And this is hurrying the sharp rotation we’ve seen this month out of these stocks and into cyclicals and small cap firms. As vaccine breakthroughs hit the headlines this month, the Russell 2000 capturing the wider universe of smaller U.S. equities has gained almost 20% - twice the rise in the S&P500, far ahead of the 8% gain in the Nasdaq100 and almost four times the narrow grouping of tech leaders of the FANG+TM index. “The real opportunity next year for investors is likely to take place below the surface in smaller-cap stocks that have greater sensitivity to what is likely to be a very strong economic recovery,” Morgan Stanley conclude. While the overall equity bull market can continue, it can also contain some violent switches that can make for quite volatile gains. What’s more, expected vaccine rollouts early next year will take time and, until then, there’s still a pandemic, periodic lockdowns and economic damage to negotiate. That’s also true for bonds and may be keeping some investors in those bunkers for longer, while the assumption of Fed policy support has rarely been disappointed in the past. But the historically skewed pricing of risk may have to shift once a truer, post-pandemic rebound finally gets underway. -- The author is editor-at-large for finance and markets at Reuters News.

8.1401019086832," FOREX-Dollar edges up after Mnuchin halts some Fed emergency funds * Dollar recovers overnight losses * Aussie, euro, yen little changed * Bitcoin nears three-year high * Graphic: World FX rates in 2020 tmsnrt.rs/2RBWI5E LONDON, Nov 20 (Reuters) - The dollar edged up against a basket of currencies in early London trading, its downward trend was interrupted when U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin called an end to some of the Federal Reserve’s pandemic lending. Mnuchin’s move re-appropriated some $455 billion allocated to the Treasury for other spending, but some investors were concerned about ending programmes that they think have played a vital role in reassuring markets. 10-year U.S Treasury yields fell to their lowest since Nov. 9. The Fed also said it “would prefer that the full suite of emergency facilities established during the pandemic continue to serve their important role as a backstop,” a rare open confrontation with the government. The announcement curtailed optimism created by reports that Republican and Democratic Senators had agreed to resume talks on another coronavirus stimulus package. The dollar index was at 92.335 at 0801 GMT, flat on the day after it slipped overnight then picked up again as European markets opened. Analysts also cited rising COVID-19 cases as a reason for caution. “We do not see this dispute that has broken out between the US Treasury and the Federal Reserve as having much implication for the financial markets. For sure something like this is generally not good news at all but at the tail-end of an administration should mean the risk of actual harm to the real economy is limited,” wrote MUFG head of research Derek Halpenny. Halpenny also said that a possible lack of smooth transition between governments in Washington “creates additional uncertainty that only further reinforces the need for the Fed to fill the policy vacuum when it meets on 16th December”, which will keep the U.S. dollar weaker. Still, the dollar was down around 0.5% on the week, as currency market sentiment has been buoyed by U.S. President-elect Joe Biden’s victory and the progress towards a COVID-19 vaccine. The Australian dollar - seen as a liquid proxy for risk appetite - is having its best month versus the U.S. dollar since April, in terms of percentage change. The Japanese yen was down around 0.1% against the dollar, at 103.84 at 0824 GMT. The euro was flat against the dollar, at $1.18725 at 0825GMT , on track for a small weekly gain. “There is simply a lack of new impulses at present to let EUR-USD break out of the range of 1.16-1.19,” wrote Commerzbank strategist You-Na Park-Heger. “Yes, there is still optimistic news regarding a possible vaccine, but the euphoria about that question has eased notably,” she said, adding that the European Central Bank is expected to increase stimulus in December. European Union leaders clashed on Thursday over Hungary and Poland vetoing the bloc’s 1.8 trillion-euro ($2.14 trillion) recovery plan, but decided to allow more time for an agreement. The euro was unaffected. “We are inclined to think a common solution will be eventually found (in line with the prior examples of EU disputes) taking away the hurdle for more EUR/USD upside in 2021, and noting the wider soft USD environment,” wrote ING strategists. Elsewhere, Bitcoin came close to – but did not surpass – the Wednesday’s three-year high of $18,483. ($1 = 0.8425 euros)"
8.1401019086832," FACTBOX-This is where the Fed's emergency facilities stand Nov 19 (Reuters) - Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Thursday requested the Federal Reserve return unused funds from several emergency lending facilities set up last spring to shore up a range of credit markets rocked by the coronavirus outbreak. The move effectively means many of the programs will be sunset after Dec. 31, when they are set to expire. Mnuchin extended some of the programs, including those supporting money market funds and the market for commercial paper, for an additional 90 days beyond year-end. While some of the programs were lightly used, Fed officials said having them open as a backstop helped to stabilize markets during the pandemic. Here’s a look at where the various programs stand, how much they were used, and when they expire. EXPIRING DEC. 31: ** MAIN STREET LENDING FACILITY Loans extended through Nov. 18: $5.4 billion The Fed has made several changes to the $600 billion Main Street program, including as recently as last month, in an effort to boost participation. The Fed opened the program to nonprofit groups and reduced the minimum loan amount to $100,000. But use of the program remained tepid. ** MUNICIPAL LIQUIDITY FACILITY Loans extended through Nov. 18: $1.7 billion The Municipal Liquidity Facility made up to $500 billion available for state and local governments, but it was only tapped by two borrowers - Illinois and New York’s cash-strapped Metropolitan Transportation Authority. ** TERM ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES LOAN FACILITY Loans extended through Nov. 18: $3.8 billion The TALF program purchased bundles of assets secured by auto loans, credit cards, student loans, loans backed by the Small Business Administration and other types of credit. Its aim is to make sure banks and other lenders such as auto finance companies have the cash to keep making loans to consumers and businesses. ** PRIMARY MARKET CORPORATE CREDIT FACILITY Loans extended through Nov. 18: $0 This program is meant to serve as a backstop for corporate debt, with the Fed offering to buy bonds and issue loans to companies. But issuers never tapped the facility for support. ** SECONDARY MARKET CORPORATE CREDIT FACILITY Loans extended through Nov. 18: $13.5 billion The Fed used this program to boost liquidity in the corporate credit market, at first by purchasing exchange-traded funds that invest in corporate bonds. The central bank then pivoted to purchasing individual corporate credit bonds in the secondary market, using an indexing approach to create broad market exposure. EXTENDED FOR 90 DAYS AFTER DEC. 31: ** COMMERCIAL PAPER FUNDING FACILITY Loans extended through Nov. 18: $0 The Fed reintroduced the CPFF, a tool it used during the last financial crisis, to get money directly into the hands of large businesses, which are major employers. The market for commercial paper, an essential source of short-term funding for many companies, had come under strain amid worries that companies affected by the pandemic would not be able to repay their IOUs. ** PRIMARY DEALER CREDIT FACILITY Loans extended through Nov. 18: $255 million Through this facility, the Fed offers short-term loans to the two dozen Wall Street firms authorized to transact directly with the central bank. The program offers funding of up to 90 days to primary dealers. A similar program run from 2008 to 2010 only offered overnight loans. ** MONEY MARKET MUTUAL FUND LIQUIDITY FACILITY Loans extended through Nov. 18: $5.2 billion This facility was established to keep the money market mutual fund industry functioning at a time when investors were withdrawing money at a fast clip. The tool offers loans of up to one year to financial institutions that pledge as collateral high-quality assets like U.S. Treasury bonds that they have purchased from money market mutual funds."
8.753535727896674," Dubai Islamic Bank sells $1 billion in perpetual sukuk DUBAI (Reuters) - Dubai Islamic Bank DISB.DU, the United Arab Emirates' largest Islamic lender, on Thursday sold $1 billion in Additional Tier 1 sukuk, or Islamic bonds, at 4.625%, a document from one of the banks arranging the deal showed. Overall debt issuance from the Gulf so far this year has already surpassed last year’s total, again topping $100 billion and setting a new record as borrowers - especially governments - seek to bolster their finances amid the coronavirus crisis and weak oil prices. Several more debt sales are expected before year-end, banking sources said. DIB began marketing the notes at around 5.25% earlier on Thursday and received over $5.5 billion in orders for the debt sale, the document showed. “Very tight pricing, coupled with a 5-1/2-times oversubscription, indicates high interest from investors as they lack alternative shariah-compliant instruments, in which there has been a long mismatch between supply and demand,” a fixed income strategist said. Additional Tier 1 (AT1) bonds, the riskiest debt instruments banks can issue, are designed to be perpetual in nature, but lenders can call them after a specified period. Other banks in the UAE, including First Abu Dhabi Bank, Emirates NBD and Commercial Bank of Dubai have also sold AT1 bonds this year as they seek to shore up their Tier 1 capital as they book higher loan loss provisions amid the coronavirus crisis. The sukuk’s first call date is in May 2026. The profit rate will reset in November 2026 based on a correlation with six-year U.S. Treasury swaps and will reset every six years thereafter. The deal was arranged by Dubai Islamic Bank, Emirates NBD Capital ENBD.DU, First Abu Dhabi Bank FAB.AD, HSBC HSBA.L, Sharjah Islamic Bank SIB.AD, and Standard Chartered STAN.L."
