101.94647201946472," Minnesota regulators approve permits for Enbridge's Line 3 oil pipeline project (Reuters) - Minnesota regulators on Thursday approved key permits for Enbridge Inc's ENB.TO Line 3 crude pipeline replacement project, paving the way for federal permits from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers after years of delays. The Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) announced approvals for the Line 3 project, including the contested 401 Water Quality Certification, and the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources released the final eight permits for the project. Line 3, built in the 1960s, ships crude from a Canadian oil hub in Edmonton, Alberta, to U.S. Midwest refiners. It currently carries less oil than it was designed for because of age and corrosion. Replacing it would allow Calgary-based Enbridge to roughly double its capacity to 760,000 barrels per day. The project still needs final permits and authorizations before construction can begin. The Canadian portion is complete, but Enbridge has run into repeated obstacles in Minnesota, where reviews have lasted about five years. “With the 401 permit in hand, the next major step would be the receipt of the federal 404 permit, which could happen in the next few weeks,” Scotiabank analysts said in a note. “Absent any successful legal challenges/injunctions, we believe the project is well positioned to start construction in the new year.” Environmental groups challenged the draft water permits for the pipeline’s construction, which were approved by MPCA in February. A shortage of pipelines has weighed on Canadian oil prices and pushed it to trade at deep discounts compared with benchmark futures in recent years, but capacity became ample this year after steep oil production cuts during the COVID-19 pandemic. Canadian oil traders said the news was bullish for crude differentials. “This is a good thing for sure. Finally ... it’s taken years to get permits and approvals,” one trader said."

Russia told residents on Saturday to stay away from a beach in Kamchatka due to pollution that Greenpeace said was evidence of an “ecological disaster” and had caused some surfers to break into a fever and vomit.

108.23170731707319," Cleveland-Cliffs to buy U.S. assets of ArcelorMittal (Reuters) - Cleveland-Cliffs Inc CLF.N, the largest U.S. producer of iron ore pellets, has agreed to buy the U.S. assets of the world's largest steelmaker ArcelorMittal SA MT.LU for about $1.4 billion in cash and shares. The deal, announced by the two companies on Monday, will make Cleveland-Cliffs the largest flat-rolled steel producer in North America and, for ArcelorMittal, give it up to a quarter share of Cleveland-Cliffs’ business and allow it to reward shareholders with a share buy-back. ArcelorMittal shares were up 8.3% in early trading, although had still not made up for losses last week, when markets tumbled over concerns that rising coronavirus cases would hinder the economic recovery. Reuters reported on Sunday, citing sources, that ArcelorMittal was in talks to merge its U.S. operations with Cleveland-Cliffs, which bought U.S. steel producer AK Steel for $3 billion in March. ArcelorMittal will receive $505 million upfront in cash and the remaining roughly two-thirds in the form of equity. The equity arrangement will give ArcelorMittal an initial stake of 16% in Cleveland-Cliffs, which could rise to 25.5%. The deal will include $2 billion of liabilities, including linked to pensions, putting the overall deal value at $3.4 billion. ArcelorMittal said it had now passed its target of offloading $2 billion of assets to reduce its debt, allowing it to carry out a $500 million share buy-back. It has previously agreed to sell stakes in its shipping business and in Brazilian steelmaker Gerdau. ArcelorMittal said it would continue to serve the North American market through operations in Canada and Mexico, which together made 9 million tonnes of steel last year, and its steel processing facility in Calvert, Alabama, a joint venture with Nippon Steel 5401.T. ArcelorMittal’s U.S. business has more than 18,000 employees and 25 facilities, including mines, steel-making facilities and finishing operations. They produced 12.9 million tonnes of steel in 2019."

108.23170731707319," Exclusive: ArcelorMittal in talks to merge U.S. assets with Cleveland-Cliffs - sources (Reuters) - ArcelorMittal SA, the world’s largest steelmaker, is exploring a deal to merge its U.S. operations with Cleveland-Cliffs Inc, the largest U.S. producer of iron ore pellets, people familiar with the matter said on Sunday. The combination would signal a new push among steelmakers to consolidate and diversify their business, making it less vulnerable to swings in demand. It would come after Cleveland-Cliffs acquired AK Steel, a U.S. maker of flat-rolled carbon steels, including stainless steel, for $3 billion, including debt, last March. The latest deal could result in the merger of U.S. assets of Luxembourg-based ArcelorMittal that are worth between $2 billion and $3 billion with Cleveland-Cliffs, one of the sources said. It would be transformative for Cleveland-Cliffs, which has a market value of $2.3 billion and had total long-term debt as of the end of June of $4.5 billion. There is no certainty the negotiations will lead to a deal, the sources said. If, however, the talks prove successful, a deal could be announced in the coming days, one of the sources added. The sources requested anonymity because the matter is confidential. ArcelorMittal and Cleveland-Cliffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment. ArcelorMittal’s U.S. business has more than 18,000 employees and 25 facilities, including mines, steelmaking facilities and finishing operations, according to the company’s website. Headquartered in Cleveland, Cleveland-Cliffs employs about 11,000 people across mining and steel manufacturing operations in the United States and Canada. ArcelorMittal said last year it was aiming to offload $2 billion of assets by the middle of 2021 to reduce its debt. In December, it agreed to sell a 50% stake in its shipping business, and has also sold its stake in Brazilian steelmaker Gerdau. After it acquired AK Steel, which derived 66% of its revenue in 2019 from the automotive market, Cleveland-Cliffs experienced a drop in demand from its car manufacturing clients, which were forced to temporarily halt production earlier this year because of the COVID-19 pandemic."

-11.59820009309739," Cleveland-Cliffs stock benefits from Vale troubles: Barron's NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares in mining company Cleveland-Cliffs Inc has benefited from troubles at rival Vale SA after three of Vale’s dams ruptured at an iron-ore mine in Brazil last month, Barron’s financial newspaper said in its latest edition. The incident marked Vale’s second deadly accident in the region in three years, leading the company to suspend dividend payments, Barron’s said. Further, a court ordered Vale to stop work at its Brucutu mine and its license to operate at the property was revoked. The company also invoked the force majeure clause on some of its contracts as a result of lower production, Barron’s noted. Vale’s troubles have been helped Cleveland-Cliffs shares, Barron’s said. Following its fourth-quarter earnings report, Cleveland-Cliffs stocks rose 8.5 percent to $11.83 on Friday. The company earned $2.03 per share in the quarter on revenue of $696.3 million. It said on a conference call that the affect of Vale events has not yet been quantified. Macquarie analyst David Lipschitz reiterated an “Outperform” rating on Cleveland-Cliffs and raised his price target by $2, to $13, following the earnings report, Barron’s said."
-17.939546445429237," 'You are an embarrassment': Miner Cleveland-Cliffs' CEO blasts financial analysts (Reuters) - Iron ore producer Cleveland-Cliffs Inc Chief Executive Officer Lourenco Goncalves slammed Wall Street financial analysts on Friday, saying some of them were an “embarrassment” and did not understand his company’s business. Responding to a question by B. Riley analyst Lucas Pipes during the company’s quarterly earnings conference call, Goncalves blasted other analysts for what he called their inability to “read numbers.” “You don’t understand our business, you don’t understand even your own business,” he said, referring to no one in particular. “You are a disaster. You are an embarrassment to your parents.” Goncalves has spoken bluntly before to analysts. His Friday behavior came months after automaker Tesla Inc’s Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk snubbed Wall Street analysts, saying “boring, boneheaded questions are not cool”. Musk later acknowledged that it was “foolish” of him to ignore the analysts on Tesla’s earnings conference call. Goncalves’ rant came after the company’s shares gave up early gains on Friday. The stock tumbled 10 percent in afternoon trade, before trimming losses to end 4 percent lower. The company reported third-quarter earnings from continuing operations of 64 cents per share. The result missed analysts’ average estimate of 66 cents, according to Refinitiv data. Quarterly revenue, however, topped expectations as the company sold more iron pellets than a year earlier. On the conference call, Goncalves suggested the company would buy back its shares if they continued to fall in value. “If the stock continues to go down based on these kids that play with computers and somebody else’s money, we are going to buy back stock,” he said. “We are going to screw these guys so badly that I don’t believe that they will be able to only resign. They will have to commit suicide ... You are messing with the wrong guy.” Goncalves also called out Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew Korn: “You can run, but you can’t hide,” he said. Goldman Sachs declined to comment when contacted by Reuters. In 2014, Goncalves gave a similar performance, refusing to answer questions from Wells Fargo analyst Sam Dubinsky, saying: “you already knew everything about my company.” “You have a $4 price target and you think we can’t sell assets, so I’m going to take the next question, I’m not going to answer you,” Goncalves had said at the time. Cleveland-Cliffs did not respond to a request for comment."
