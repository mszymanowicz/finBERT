10.824741375279062," Russian group hires TechnipFMC to design $10 bln LNG plant MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian investment group A-Property has hired energy services company TechnipFMC to design a $10 billion liquefied natural gas operation in the north of the country that it hopes to complete by 2025 and sell LNG to Asia. A-Property spokeswoman Anastasia Kharitonova told Reuters that the plant and surrounding infrastructure in the remote northern republic of Yakutia would require a $10 billion investment. The LNG plant will aim to produce 13 million tonnes of LNG per year at maximum capacity and will be located relatively close to the Chinese border. A-Property plans to seek permission from the Russian government to export LNG, Kharitonova said. Russia has prioritised the development of LNG for export and the project may help the country reach its goal of producing 120 to 130 million tonnes of LNG a year in the next decade and raise its share in the global LNG market to up to 20% from around 6% in 2018, based on government data. TechnipFMC will work on the design phase of the project which should be complete by the end of 2020. A-Property is owned by Russian energy tycoon Albert Avdolyan, partner of Russian state technology corporation Rostec. Last year, Avdolyan’s firm acquired the largest gas producer in Yakutia after buying out its debt and plans to use it as the resource base for the announced LNG project."
-5.084746038494701," TechnipFMC cuts executive pay and dividend as pandemic fallout bites PARIS (Reuters) - Oil services company TechnipFMC FTI.N said on Wednesday it would slash the salaries of executives and retainers paid to company directors by 30%, after cutting its dividend by 75% in search of savings to cushion the impact of the novel coronavirus outbreak. The Franco-American firm, whose clients include major companies in the oil and gas sector, said it had increased its cost savings target to more than $350 million this year from the $130 million it announced on April 1. It lowered executive compensation for the year, cutting the salary of its chairman and chief executive officer by 30%. It reduced the board of directors’ retainers by 30% and its executive leadership team’s salaries by 20%. “Over the last two months, much about the world has changed, and we are taking swift and decisive actions in response to the market environment,” Chairman and CEO Doug Pferdehirt said in a statement. The company said on Tuesday it would pay $0.13 per share as a dividend this year instead of every quarter, due to the sharp decline in commodity pricing and the impact of COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus. The company said revenue in the first three months of the year was at $3.13 billion, up 7.5% from the same period a year ago, while the net loss was at $3.256 billion, versus a year-ago net profit of $20.9 million. After-tax charges of 3.2 billion in the latest quarter included non-cash impairment and other charges totalling $3.15 billion for goodwill and other assets in the Subsea and Surface Technologies segments. Cash flow from operations in the quarter was $27.9 million. In its Subsea, TechnipFMC said the global COVID-19 pandemic created headwinds to both revenue and profit in the quarter. “Project and service disruptions varied, and in some instances, the impacts delayed revenue recognition to future periods,” it said. The group, created three years ago via the merger of Technip and FMC after the oil price crash of 2015, had been planning to separate its engineering and construction activities from its upstream oil services business in the first half of this year, but suspended that due to the market turmoil. Major oil producers with operations around the world have cut their 2020 capital spending by more than 26%, or $60.5 billion, data compiled by Reuters showed, following a slump in crude prices. Technip said it had a backlog of $22 billion, and $5.6 billion in cash and liquidity."

TechnipFMC said it was taking decisive action to address the market conditions and would incorporate its latest assessment of the operating environment and outlook when it provides updated financial guidance in its first quarter earnings on April 22.

Liquidity is further supported by a revolving credit facility of $2.5 billion, the statement said. The company said on March 15 it had put on hold its plans to split into two due to turbulence in financial markets linked to the coronavirus outbreak and the sharp drop in oil prices."

Energean said it still expected its Karish project, which will use the floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO) vessel, to deliver first gas, as planned, in the first half of 2021. The FPSO has a capacity of 8 billion cubic metres of gas a year. But the company added that “the rapidly evolving nature of these circumstances is such that it is impossible, at this stage, to determine the overall impact, if any, on Energean’s project timeline.” Energean shares were down around 2.7% at 735 pence at 1612 GMT, after earlier falling as low as 722 pence - their lowest in 11 months. The death toll of the coronavirus, which originated in and is focused on China, has exceeded 500 people and triggered global travel restrictions. “Energean has received a notice under its ... contract with TechnipFMC in relation to the travel restriction constituting a force majeure event, potentially entitling TechnipFMC to claim an extension of time,” Energean said. “Energean has, in turn, issued corresponding notices to its buyers of Karish gas and other relevant counterparties.” Energean’s main buyers are Israeli utilities."
-19.30806466921884," Oil services firm TechnipFMC to split into two publicly traded companies (Reuters) - Franco-American oil services firm TechnipFMC Plc FTI.N said on Monday it would spin off its engineering and construction operations into a separate company, leaving it as a technology-focused equipment supplier to oil and gas companies. TechnipFMC, which had a market capitalization of $10.31 billion, said the new Paris-based company will deal with onshore and offshore oil and gas projects. The split is expected to be final in the first half of 2020. The spin-off comes nearly three years after Technip merged with rival FMC Technologies, creating a leading London-based offshore services company with combined revenue of $20 billion. That deal closed near the nadir of an oil-price crash, when U.S. crude futures fell to about $26 a barrel and prompted cutbacks in spending on new offshore oil and gas development projects. Shares of TechnipFMC rose more than 6% before paring gains to 4.3% shortly before the close. Company names after the spin-off were not disclosed. Although the 2017 Technip-FMC Technologies merger was successful, Chief Executive Doug Pferdehirt said the spin-off would improve flexibility and allow the new companies to unlock new opportunities. “The strategic rationale is compelling,” Pferdehirt told investors during a conference call on Monday. “When you over-integrate, the customer sometimes sees you as being greedy. That doesn’t work very well. We’re a humble company, and like to integrate where it makes clear, commercial sense,” he said. Pferdehirt will remain CEO for the upstream-focused company, which will focus on capital intensive subsea technologies and services. The Houston-based company will have a workforce of about 22,000 people. Catherine MacGregor, who joined TechnipFMC's New Ventures group last month after more than two decades at Schlumberger NV SLB.N, will head up the engineering and construction services company. It will pursue new opportunities in liquefied natural gas (LNG) and broaden its market focus to include biofuels and alternative energy projects. That company will have about 15,000 employees. TechnipFMC received a record volume of orders in the second quarter, supported by new liquefied natural gas (LNG) projects. The company recently won a $7.6 billion contract from Russia’s Novatek for the Arctic LNG-2 project in western Siberia. MacGregor told investors that additional LNG projects were likely meet global demand for the fuel through 2035 and 2040."
