37.7139785624224," DuPont results, annual forecast beat estimates on cost-cutting push (Reuters) - DuPont DD.N forecast annual profit above expectations on Thursday as a tight check on costs and a recovery in the automotive industry, one of its biggest markets, helped the industrial materials maker's quarterly results beat estimates. The company, which makes everything from brake fluid to fabric used in protective garments, has been cutting costs to battle weak demand in several industries due to the COVID-19 pandemic. DuPont raised its cost-cut target, saying it expects to save $280 million for the year, $100 million more than its prior forecast, as it renegotiated some contracts and speeded up its workforce reduction plans. The company, which is heavily exposed to the auto industry, is also benefiting from a revival in sales for car makers after a relaxation to lockdowns in several economies. Its third-quarter sales in transportation and industrial business fell 14%, but rose 20% from the prior quarter. Sales in its electronics and imaging business rose 7%, helped by builds in semiconductor technologies ahead of the launch of some premium smartphones. It forecast full-year profit of $3.17 to $3.21 per share, well above estimates of $3.03, according to Refinitiv data. Net sales forecast of $20.1 billion to $20.2 billion was at its midpoint, marginally above estimates of $20.1 billion. DuPont’s adjusted earnings per share of 88 cents for the quarter beat estimates of 75 cents. Sales of $5.1 billion also surpassed $5 billion estimated by analysts."
5.803575048174513," DuPont takes $2.5 billion charge tied to auto business, posts wider loss (Reuters) - DuPont DD.N reported a bigger second-quarter loss on Thursday and wrote down the value of its automotive business by $2.5 billion as the industrial materials giant struggles with a prolonged weakness in one of its biggest markets. DuPont, which makes materials used in products ranging from engine covers to brake fluid, is heavily exposed to the auto industry, which has been among the hardest hit after the coronavirus lockdowns emptied roads and shuttered car showrooms. The company, however, beat estimates for both adjusted profit and sales, helped by cost cuts and higher organic sales in its nutrition and electronics units, which benefited from a surge in demand for food ingredients and memory chips. DuPont shares were flat in early trade. The company booked the impairment charge under its Transportation & Industrial segment, which reported the sharpest decline in sales at 34%, saying the business was now worth less because of continued weakness in global automotive production. Even before the outbreak, DuPont had been grappling with lower sales in the unit, particularly due to lower prices for nylon, a stiff plastic used in making auto parts and industrial equipment. Expecting a modest revival in automotive and residential construction industries, DuPont projected adjusted earnings between 71 and 73 cents for the current quarter, marginally above the 71 cents estimated by analysts according to Refinitiv IBES data. Net loss available to shareholders, which included the hefty charge, was $2.48 billion, or $3.37 per share, in the three months ended June 30 compared to a loss of $571 million, or 76 cents per share, a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, DuPont posted earnings of 70 cents per share, handily beating 59 cents estimated by analysts. The Wilmington, Delaware-based company, once part of the conglomerate DowDuPont that was split up last year, reported sales of $4.8 billion, just above estimates of $4.7 billion."

23.882618298785," Breakingviews - Corona Capital: Apple bonds, DuPont’s priorities NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO/HONG KONG/MILAN/LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Corona Capital is a daily column updated throughout the day by Breakingviews columnists around the world with short, sharp pandemic-related insights. - Apple raises cheap debt - DuPont hunkers down APPLE’S CASH BEGETS YET MORE. The iPhone maker had nearly $200 billion in its war chest at the end of March. On Monday, the company led by Tim Cook raised another $8.5 billion, issuing bonds at some of the lowest interest rates it has paid in years, including three-year paper with a miserly 0.75% coupon. That’s thanks to the willingness of the Federal Reserve to backstop debt markets. The Fed’s programs are designed to help companies struggling with the impact of the coronavirus top up their cash coffers, something beleaguered aircraft producer Boeing did with a massive $25 billion bond issue last week – enough to eschew government aid. Apple, though bruised by the economic and supply-chain damage wrought by the coronavirus, has no need to borrow more. But if funds are cheap enough, it’s a rational way to continue funding its hefty dividends and stock buybacks. (By Richard Beales) DUPONT’S PPE BLIP. The U.S. specialty materials and chemicals outfit run by Ed Breen is battening down the hatches for a tough second quarter, particularly in its automotive segment. The $30 billion-odd company, one of the three listed groups that were part of DowDuPont until last year, has bolstered its balance sheet and liquidity and increased its cost-cutting target. One brighter spot is in disposable gear for health workers – the personal protective equipment or PPE that’s in demand around the world. DuPont sold 55% more Tyvek gowns and the like in the first quarter than a year earlier, upping output by more than 9 million per month – more than double production in any previous crisis, the company said. It won’t make up for the losses elsewhere, though. The grand value-creating vision behind the merger that created DowDuPont and its three-way split is looking very fuzzy. (By Richard Beales) NO MORE DRAMA. The U.S. Treasury Department said on Monday that it will borrow an unprecedented $3 trillion this quarter, mostly to fund virus-related aid. That’s a good excuse to close the curtain on the archaic debt ceiling, which allows Congress to set the borrowing limit for money the U.S. government has already spent. It has become a political cudgel, raising the specter of a U.S. default and a government shutdown every few years unless it has increased or, as it currently is until next year, suspended. Some deficit hawks have tried to use the limit to impose fiscal discipline. But that charade largely ended even before the pandemic: Federal debt held by the public hit almost 80% of GDP at the end of the last fiscal year. That could jump to 101% by the end of this one. It’s time to end the act. (By Gina Chon) M&A LIFELINE. Fiat Chrysler Automobiles’, plan to merge with Peugeot is throwing both carmakers a lifeline. The Italian-American maker of Jeep said on Tuesday that its adjusted operating profit fell 95% in the first quarter from a year earlier because of the collapse in car demand caused by the coronavirus. While Fiat declined to give guidance for the full year, it expects a significant loss in the second quarter. Car production is gradually restarting in Italy and the United States. Consumers are, however, unlikely to snap up expensive items such as autos when their employment prospects are grim. The imperative to cut costs, which pre-dates the pandemic, is now crucial to survival. Fiat and Peugeot have promised to deliver 3.7 billion euros in annual savings through their tie-up. The sooner these are realised, the better. (By Lisa Jucca) LONG-TERM GREEDY. Macquarie’s boss is trying to see past the Covid-19 devastation. Shemara Wikramanayake opened the bank’s annual conference for Australian companies on Tuesday arguing that trends such as urbanisation, climate change and digitisation will drive demand for infrastructure, renewable energy and technology. And on the same day the government estimated that containment efforts are costing the economy $2.4 billion a week, she said the country can emerge from the crisis in good shape, partly thanks to many successful corporate capital calls. Funnily enough, Macquarie gets paid to help issue equity and its business model hinges on financing roads, ports, wind farms and such. With the bank’s shares down by a third from their peak in February, it’s no wonder Wikramanayake wants to keep the focus beyond the virus horizon. Of course, just because she’s talking her book doesn’t mean she’s wrong. (By Jeffrey Goldfarb) PANDEMIC THRIFT. EssilorLuxottica has rediscovered the value of saving in a crisis. Faced with a 10% revenue contraction in the first quarter, the world’s biggest maker of frames and optical lenses has cancelled dividends, buybacks and non-crucial investments. That’s smart if it wants to carry out a planned cash acquisition of optical retailer GrandVision while also coping with severe Covid-19 disruptions. The 7 billion euro price tag, agreed in July last year, does not look cheap given the collapse in stock markets since then. And EssilorLuxottica said on Tuesday that it expects the second quarter to be even worse than the first. Its net debt of 4.8 billion euros, now comfortably just above 1 times EBITDA, could be pushed up to 3 times that measure by year end, says Morningstar. Luckily, the French-Italian group is sitting on a 4.9 billion euro liquidity pot and has pre-funded most of the GrandVision acquisition cost. Continuing to keep a lean profile in the crisis is the right approach. (By Lisa Jucca) LIVIN’ ON A PRAIRIE. Beiersdorf’s investors are down on their luck. The maker of Nivea posted a 3.6% decline in first-quarter revenue to 1.9 billion euros, stripping out the impact of currency changes and mergers and acquisitions. Chief Executive Stefan De Loecker said he will stick with the company’s one-year-old investment programme but said little on its progress, suggesting he’s less than even halfway there. The multi-year scheme was supposed to help Beiersdorf access new markets, and boost innovation, digitalisation and workforce training. But so far it’s failing to protect its brands. Sales of luxury skincare line La Prairie fell 36% because it couldn’t be sold in airports, lagging behind L’Oreal brands for which e-commerce strategies softened the blow. De Loecker is hoping to acquire some bargains in the crisis, but until he can show his investments are paying off, he’s better off just holding on to what he’s got. (By Dasha Afanasieva) TOTAL’S HALFWAY HOUSE. After BP held its dividend and Royal Dutch Shell, slashed its by two-thirds, the $87 billion French crude producer is giving investors the option to receive its fourth-quarter dividend for 2019 in shares. Assuming 60% go for it – as happened the last time so-called “scrip” was offered – it will add $1 billion to the group’s under-fire free cash flow. While this may look like fence-sitting, it could make sense. Total is less leveraged than Shell and BP and has a big liquidity buffer. More importantly, oil prices have rallied from the start of May as analysts start to get slightly less pessimistic about a recovery in demand. Retaining the scope to extend the “scrip” further, or wind it down, might prove to have been a better strategy than BP’s inaction and Shell’s doom and gloom. (By George Hay)"
23.882618298785," DuPont sees tough second quarter as auto sales crater (Reuters) - Industrial materials maker DuPont DD.N said on Tuesday its second quarter would be the ""low point"" of the year as the COVID-19 pandemic slams the brakes on global vehicle sales, hurting the company's automotive business. The industrial giant is heavily exposed to the auto industry, which was hard-hit by the U.S.-China trade war even before lockdowns imposed to arrest the spread of the virus emptied roads and shuttered car showrooms. The company said it recorded a low-to-mid-teens percentage fall in April sales from last year’s levels. “As we see it now, the second quarter should be the low point,” said Chief Financial Officer Lori Koch on a conference call with analysts. “I think mid-teens down on revenue is probably the bottom of what we’re seeing, based on what we know as of today,” Chief Executive Officer Ed Breen said. He said DuPont expects continued demand for its products like protective gowns and food ingredients but that is “expected to be more than offset by the well-known softness in automotive, aerospace, oil and gas and other industrial markets.” Sales in its transportation and industrial segment (T&I) fell 13% in the first quarter, weighed down by lower volumes and a fall in prices for nylon, a stiff plastic used in making auto parts and industrial equipment. DuPont expects nylon prices to continue to decline sequentially into the current-quarter. The company, which undertook a cost savings program to battle challenging market conditions, doubled its target to $180 million for the year from $90 million and slashed capital expenses by $500 million. The Wilmington, Delaware-based company, one of three parts into which chemical conglomerate DowDupont was split into last year, had earlier suspended its full-year forecast, citing uncertainties caused by the pandemic. DuPont’s stock, which has lost nearly 30% this year, rose about 4% in morning trade after it reported first-quarter adjusted earnings of 84 cents per share, beating analysts’ average estimates of 75 cents."

30.98541269538209," DuPont doubles output of protective gowns to 30 million per month (Reuters) - Industrial materials maker DuPont DD.N is doubling production of protective garments it makes from its Tyvek material to about 30 million a month to help meet increased demand due to the coronavirus outbreak. The spread of the pandemic across Europe and the United States has led to a worldwide scramble for protective masks, gowns and gloves worn by healthcare and other workers battling to curb the spread of the virus. Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security estimated this month that a single 100-day COVID-19 wave would create a need for 321 million more isolation gowns, such as those made by Dupont, in the United States alone. Before the coronavirus crisis, the global market for personal protective equipment (PPE) was valued at about $40 billion annually, with Dupont and U.S. peers Honeywell International Inc HON.N and 3M Co MMM.N among the biggest players. That will now increase. “We’re producing up to almost two times the number of garments per month to help support the demand that’s currently in front of us,” John Richard, vice president of DuPont’s safety business told Reuters. DuPont’s Tyvek, a fabric used in gowns and coveralls for protective use, has been a silver lining for the company as it faces steep declines in demand for its products in the auto sector and other industries hammered by the virus outbreak. The company pulled its full-year forecast on Monday, but estimated first-quarter profit would top Wall Street estimates on demand for products such as Tyvek and those used in water filtration. The industrial giant, a top player in the PPE market with other products such as protective gloves, flame-resistant and chemical protective clothing, said everything it was producing was being sold promptly. The company expects the heightened demand to continue at least until later this year as industries resume operations and bring back workers using additional safety measures. DuPont, which makes Tyvek in Richmond, Virginia and Luxembourg, has re-purposed its manufacturing operations and simplified some designs to eke out more pieces per square area of the fabric. Dow DOW.N, part of the erstwhile DowDupont conglomerate before a split last year, has also started making sanitizers and face shields to meet growing demand."
34.628268044919885," DuPont sees quarterly profit above expectations on coronavirus-led demand (Reuters) - Industrial materials maker DuPont DD.N on Monday estimated first-quarter profit above Wall Street's expectations, as the coronavirus outbreak lifted demand for its products used in personal protection and water filtration. The company, however, suspended its forecast for full-year sales and adjusted earnings, citing uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic in some of its end markets. DuPont, which makes everything from brake fluid to fabric used in protective garments, is expected to have mixed impact from the virus outbreak. Demand for some of the company’s products, such as Tyvek personal protective garments, has risen, while other key end markets, like the automotive sector, have suffered due to a decline in travel brought by the pandemic. DuPont said it had idled operations at several manufacturing sites, mainly production plants that fall under its transportation and industrial business, and delayed some capital investment to bolster its cash reserves. It had also entered a $1.0 billion revolving credit facility, replacing the $750 million facility set to expire in June, and secured $2.0 billion in committed financing to ensure that it can refinance debt maturities in November. Shares of DuPont, which was spun-off from conglomerate DowDupont in a three-way split last year, were up 4.3% at $40 in pre-market trading. The company said it expects to report first-quarter adjusted earnings per share between 82 cents and 84 cents on net sales of about $5.2 billion, as strong demand for materials used in food and beverage, probiotics and electronics markets also buoyed results. Analysts on average had estimated profit of 68 cents per share on revenue of $5.01 billion, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. Dupont in March trimmed its full-year sales forecast by $200 million to a range of $21.3 billion to $21.8 billion and maintained annual adjusted earnings outlook of $3.70 per share to $3.90 per share. The company, which has been cutting costs aggressively, said last month it would consider lowering costs beyond the $90 million it had previously estimated.

-9.41751263832655," Breen to return as DuPont CEO (Reuters) - DuPont has brought back management veteran Edward Breen as its chief executive officer, in a move that the industrial materials maker is hoping will help lift sluggish sales since its split from DowDuPont Inc. Breen, who is currently the chairman of DuPont, will replace Marc Doyle, the company said on Tuesday. The board concluded now is the right time to restore Breen to the chief executive role to draw more directly on his substantial operating experience, DuPont’s lead independent director Alexander Cutler said in a statement. DuPont last month reported fourth-quarter profit below estimates as it struggled with subdued demand in the electronics and automotive sectors, largely due to the U.S.-China trade war. “While we made some progress in 2019, we did not meet our own expectations and we now need to move aggressively to secure our foundation for growth,” Breen said in a statement. Breen recently orchestrated the divestiture of DuPont’s $26 billion nutrition unit in a merger with International Flavors & Fragrances Inc, less than a year after spearheading the breakup of DowDuPont into three companies. DuPont also named Lori Koch as chief financial officer, replacing Jeanmarie Desmond, and said it will advance the cost-cutting initiatives announced earlier. The executive changes are effective immediately and both Doyle and Desmond will leave the company, DuPont said."
1.6393830556484572," Third Point, U.S. settle over antitrust filing in DowDuPont stake BOSTON (Reuters) - Third Point LLC has agreed to pay more than $600,000 to settle allegations the hedge fund failed to properly file for antitrust clearance when it bought DowDuPont stock two years ago, the U.S. Justice Department said on Wednesday. Third Point, which invests roughly $15 billion in securities around the world and is run by billionaire investor Daniel Loeb, will pay a civil fine of $609,810, the department said. Two years ago the hedge fund allegedly bought too much DowDuPont stock too quickly, failing to make the required Hart-Scott-Rodino filings or observe a required waiting period. The hedge fund could have faced much higher penalties but the Justice Department said it reduced the fine because the “violation was inadvertent.” Firms are required to make the Hart-Scott-Rodino filings to give the government time to investigate potential antitrust violations. Third Point declined to comment. Third Point’s alleged misstep revolved around the August 2017 merger of Dow and DuPont when their separate stocks stopped trading on Aug. 31, 2017 and were replaced by DowDuPont shares, which began trading on Sept. 1, 2017. Earlier this year Dow Inc was formally spun off from DowDuPont Inc. Third Point received voting securities of DowDuPont in excess of $80.8 million through the merger, the threshold for making the required filing at that time. While Third Point properly observed the rules when it bought Dow stock long before the merger in 2014, the Justice Department said that because DowDuPont was a different company, the hedge fund was required to make another filing after the merger. The government also noted that Third Point had previously violated filing requirements in connection with building a stake in Yahoo Inc shares in 2011."

Dow and Dupont, which completed a $130 billion merger last September to form DowDuPont, also immediately announced plans to create three separately traded companies focusing on agriculture, plastics and specialty products. Breen, who was CEO of the erstwhile DuPont, had spearheaded the merger of the two companies and has since led a plan to cut $3.3 billion in expenses. He will be executive chairman of the chemicals business, called DuPont, from June 1 next year. The specialty products unit’s current Chief Operating Officer Marc Doyle will become its Chief Executive Officer. “Breen will work closely with the senior leadership team and focus on the company’s portfolio management strategy, capital allocation decisions, and, in conjunction with Marc Doyle, shareholder engagement,” the company said in a statement. The specialty products business, which makes products that go into construction materials or semiconductors and microchips, accounted for about a quarter of the company’s total sales as of June 2017. Its materials science plastics unit is the largest by sales, but was stripped of an extra $8 billion worth of annual business as part of the division, after pressure from hedge fund investors Trian Partners and Third Point LLC. James Collins Jr. currently the chief operating officer of DowDuPont’s agriculture business, will be heading the new agriculture business called Corteva Agriscience.
