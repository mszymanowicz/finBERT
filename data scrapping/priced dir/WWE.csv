19.08990293153645," Florida deems WWE 'essential business' amid coronavirus outbreak (Reuters) - World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) has been deemed an “essential business” in Florida, the mayor of Orange County said on Monday, allowing the company to resume live tapings of its shows in the state during the coronavirus outbreak. A statewide stay-at-home order went into effect earlier this month in a bid to slow the spread of COVID-19, and while WWE was not initially viewed as essential like grocery stores and pharmacies it has since been given the green light. “I think initially there was a review that was done and they were not initially deemed an essential business,” Orange County Mayor Jerry Demings told reporters. “With some conversation with the governor’s office regarding the governor’s order, they were deemed an essential business and so therefore they were allowed to remain open.” The decision, which was outlined in an April 9 memo from Florida’s Republican Governor Ron DeSantis, allows WWE to tape live shows if the location is closed to the general public. WWE, which had been airing pre-taped shows in recent weeks, said in a statement to ESPN the health and safety of talent and staff is their top priority. “We believe it is now more important than ever to provide people with a diversion from these hard times,” said WWE. “We are producing content on a closed set with only essential personnel in attendance following appropriate guidelines while taking additional precautions to ensure the health and wellness of our performers and staff.”"

-1.9207614329803786," WWE shares smacked down as company seeks options for streaming service (Reuters) - Six years after the much-hyped launch of World Wrestling Entertainment Inc's WWE.N streaming service, WWE Network, the media company on Thursday surprised investors by saying it would evaluate strategic alternatives for the platform. The company’s streaming venture has had a rocky 2019, reporting a third straight quarter of decline in average paid subscribers. Evercore ISI said the announcement was unexpected, highlighting that the streaming service scaled quickly to around 1.5 million subscribers within two years of launching before stagnating. Shares of WWE fell more than 15% on Thursday, after the company reported lower-than-expected quarterly profit and provided a weak forecast for the year. The media group said it was looking at several initiatives to pursue growth, including the plans to pursue changes at WWE Network to strengthen user engagement. Shares of the company, which announced departure of its long time co-presidents last week, were down 15.9% to $41.22 in morning trading. Analysts had called the departures surprising, and with Evercore ISI saying that the abrupt nature of the statement suggested a tumultuous situation at the company."
-15.89657987562852," WWE's next battle royale: Investor fans vs. shorts (Reuters) - A brawl between World Wrestling Entertainment Inc’s bears and bulls could reach a peak this year as the company renegotiates overseas contracts. While a large contingent of short sellers have been betting that the stock will fall, WWE’s most ardent Wall Street fans say it will continue to rise even after outperforming the stock market last year and for much of 2019. Shares in WWE soared 144 percent in 2018 as U.S. TV license deals blew past analyst expectations with a 3.6-times hike in average annual value from its previous agreements. The stock has risen another 12.6 percent so far this year as investors are betting on license renewals being negotiated in countries including India and the United Kingdom, which WWE expects to announce by mid-year. Ten out of 13 analysts have buy ratings on the stock while three recommend holding the stock which last traded at $84.87. The mean share price target is $102.70 with the highest target at $157 and the lowest at $85, according to Refinitiv. While the stock has already risen a lot on expectations for new business, Gabelli Funds analyst Alexandra Cowie says it still has room to gain further. “I wouldn’t be selling before the contract news. Going in and coming out of announcements, it gets a double bump,” said Cowie, whose firm owns more than 174,000 WWE shares. WWE is in an unusual entertainment category. Unlike traditional sports, its fights are scripted, but analysts measure its popularity against sports because it still involves athleticism and suspense. The creator of Smackdown and Raw TV shows boasted a U.S. cable television viewership second only to the National Football League in 2018, according to Nielsen data. And in India, WWE viewership was second only to cricket, according to the Broadcast Audience Research Council. Guggenheim Securities analyst Curry Baker expects a UK renewal similar to WWE’s current contract there. But he anticipates a fivefold boost to its average annual revenue in India to $124 million. “The market is underappreciating the India opportunity,” said Baker who has a $105 price target and a buy rating on WWE. MKM analyst Eric Handler, who raised his price target for the stock to $110 from $95 on Tuesday, says a possible U.S. deal for a third weekly hour of Smackdown could add $50 million to annual revenue. The company declined to comment on the prospect of an additional hour. WWE shares have fallen roughly 9 percent since last Thursday. On Wednesday, Chief Executive Vincent McMahon sold 3.2 million of his shares, or four percent of WWE’s shares outstanding, to fund a separate entity. The stock last traded down 0.9 percent on Thursday in active trade though analysts said the news did not change their outlook It has also come under pressure as the broader market has been losing ground on worries about global economic growth. But analysts say WWE contracts - which are for around three to five years - provide some insulation against economic fluctuations. In the United States, live sports have been a key draw for cable TV subscribers, at a time when many consumers are cutting the chord to avoid high monthly fees. “It feels like one of the lower-risk higher-return names in the media space,” said Baker. Still, about 17 percent of WWE’s float is sold short, according to data from S3 Partners which estimates short seller mark-to-market losses of $359 million since the start of 2018. The bets against the stock can be partly attributed to hedging by investors in its convertible bonds due in 2023, according to BTIG analyst Brandon Ross. “That’s contributed to it,” he said. Wolfe Research analyst Marci Ryvicker is Wall Street’s biggest fan, with a price target of $157. Wall Street expects 2020 earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $460.59 million on $1.33 billion revenue, according to Refinitiv data. Ryvicker expects EBITDA of $510 million on revenue of $1.423 billion. With this in mind, Ryvicker says WWE looks cheap compared with other sports peers, including Knicks basketball team owner Madison Square Garden Co and a Liberty Media Corp subsidiary which owns Formula One rights and Liberty’s subsidiary that owns the Atlanta Braves baseball team. WWE’s enterprise value is roughly 14.8 times her 2020 EBITDA estimates compared with multiples of 32 for Madison Square Garden, 33.2 for Liberty’s Atlanta Braves subsidiary and 12.6 for the Formula One subsidiary, the analyst wrote. WWE “has no reason not to trade right in-line with its closest peers,” Ryvicker said."

-17.740805119635173," U.S. judge dismisses concussions lawsuits against World Wrestling (Reuters) - A federal judge has dismissed lawsuits by dozens of former professional wrestlers who accused World Wrestling Entertainment Inc of failing to protect them from concussions and other head trauma, including chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). Many claims filed on behalf of 53 wrestlers like Joseph “Road Warrior Animal” Laurinaitis and Jimmy “Superfly” Snuka were brought too late and some were frivolous, U.S. District Judge Vanessa Bryant in Hartford, Connecticut, ruled on Monday. Bryant also found no basis to suggest the defendants, including WWE Chief Executive Officer Vince McMahon, knew of any link between wrestling and CTE before 2007, which was after most of the plaintiffs had retired. “The court is also unwilling to find that the diagnosis of one wrestler with CTE is sufficient to imbue WWE with actual awareness of a probable link between wrestling and CTE,” Bryant added. WWE shares rose 2.3 percent to $89.74 on Tuesday. CTE is a neurodegenerative disease often caused by repeated trauma to the head, and cannot be diagnosed before death. A large part of Bryant’s 40-page decision focused on the plaintiffs’ lawyer Konstantine Kyros, who the judge said “persistently” ignored her orders and caused a “considerable waste” of time and resources over 3-1/2 years of litigation. “The opinions expressed about my strong advocacy are inaccurate, bizarre and unworthy of the court,” Kyros said in an email on Tuesday, adding that Bryant should have let the case go to a jury. “We trust the wrestlers’ claims will be better received in the appeals courts,” he added. Jerry McDevitt, a partner at K&L Gates representing Stamford, Connecticut-based WWE, welcomed the ruling. “It was a thoughtful decision,” he said in an interview. “The WWE did not engage in misconduct, and had educated wrestlers about the risks.” Laurinaitis has experienced memory loss, dizzy spells and sleep apnea, according to an amended complaint filed last November, while Snuka had CTE, dementia and Alzheimer’s disease when he died in January 2017 at age 73. The cases are McCullough et al v World Wrestling Entertainment Inc, U.S. District Court, District of Connecticut, No. 15-01074; and Laurinaitis et al v World Wrestling Entertainment Inc et al in the same court, No. 16-01209."
