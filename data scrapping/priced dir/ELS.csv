8.622513340399635," Wall Street increasingly weighs risk from climate change NEW YORK (Reuters) - In the wake of two years of devastating wildfires in California, Wall Street is incorporating a new risk metric when evaluating companies: climate resiliency. Investors, analysts, research firms and companies are putting more emphasis on how climate issues ranging from rising sea levels to record heatwaves will affect profits and revenues in the United States and what companies are doing to address those risks. Companies located in areas such as California, Florida and Louisiana that put them at a higher risk of being affected by more severe weather patterns are increasingly being asked how they will protect their businesses from climate change. Overall, more than 70 firms have discussed the potential impact of climate change on their business on their quarterly results calls since the start of the year, more than double that of last year or any other year since 2014, according to a Reuters analysis of Refinitiv data. As a result, fund managers, who typically do not incorporate environmental attributes in their analysis of a company, are taking a closer look at whether the physical locations of their property and equipment will put them at a higher risk of being impacted by climate change. “Without expecting a company to significantly change its strategy, we are increasingly having conversations with management teams to ask them about their plans for climate resilience,” said Arthur Hurley, senior portfolio manager on the Columbia Real Estate Fund. So-called ESG funds, which focus on a company’s environmental, social, and governance attributes, have been at the forefront of focusing on the physical risks of climate change. But now fund managers like Hurley are finding that companies in their portfolio like Equity Lifestyle Properties Inc ELS.N, are revealing to analysts on their earnings call that they are evaluating the potential for rising water levels when it purchases new marinas. Shares of the company are up 43% for the year to date. Hurley said he is actively going into companies, like Equity Lifestyle and Boston Properties Inc BXP.N, that are preemptively addressing potential climate impacts, whether by focusing more on the elevation of potential developments or incorporating construction design elements like putting critical equipment above floor grade. Fund managers say that the bankruptcy of San Francisco-based power company Pacific Gas & Electric Co PCG_pa.APCG.N in January prompted them to put more emphasis on climate risks. Wildfires that broke out Oct. 23 could undermine California’s largest utility’s $14 billion plan to finance its turnaround after filing in January for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection anticipating its liabilities from massive wildfires in 2017 and 2018 blamed on its equipment could top $30 billion. At the same time, there have been 10 weather and climate disaster events that have caused more than $1 billion in damages since the start of the year, already nearly double the average of 6.3 events for each full-year between 1980 and 2018, according to National Centers for Environmental Information. Insurance claims for what were once considered secondary perils - such as wildfires and hail - have accounted for $13 billion out of $15 billion in natural disaster claims through August, according to Swiss Re. The increase in wildfires has prompted underwriters, such as Hiscox Ltd HSX.L to incorporate new risks models and stop insuring some clients in high-risk areas such as California. Overall, 10% of insurers refused to renew policies in wildfire-prone areas in California in 2018, according to the California Department of Insurance. Research firms including S&P Global’s Trucost division are rolling out more climate risk analytics that are meant to help investors assess the specific climate risks that each company faces. The firm is publishing a report in the next few weeks that will focus on companies that face the highest physical risks of climate change, a spokeswoman said. In March, Silicon Valley start-up Jupiter Inc announced that it had completed a $23 million Series B funding round to expand its analytics services that can provide investors and companies with detailed short and long-term weather patterns for specific locations. “This is something that’s not going away soon,” said Gregory Peters, managing director, multi-sector and strategy head at PGIM Fixed Income. As a result, he has trimmed his positions in some California utilities, while analysts on his real estate team are increasingly focusing on climate risk. “That risk attached to the utilities is kind of a new thing that we didn’t necessarily contemplate a couple of years ago.” (This story corrects title in paragraph 20 to “managing director, multi-sector and strategy head” from “senior portfolio manager”)"
-0.0925922458806801," Investors eye bright spots in REIT sector (Reuters) - While investors say they are wary of the broader real estate industry in a rising interest rate environment, some are still bullish on sectors such as self storage and manufactured homes. Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) are typically seen as a defensive investment bet as their large dividend payouts offset slow but predictable growth. The S&P 500 real estate index .SPLRCR has outperformed in the last six months with a 5.8 percent climb compared with the broader S&P 500's .SPX 0.4 percent advance. REITs have been boosted recently on earnings strength and a slump in U.S. Treasury 10-year yields. But some investors expect them to lose steam if bonds yields turn higher, assuming that the U.S. Federal Reserve keeps raising interest rates and the economy stays strong. Investors typically prefer bonds to defensive sectors like REITs when interest rates are rising. The REIT sector however is down 0.2 percent for the year-to-date compared with the S&P’s 4.7 percent gain. It already lagged the S&P 500 for the last two years with a 7 percent rise in 2017 compared with the S&P’s 19.4 percent advance and no change in 2016 compared with the S&P’s 9.5 percent increase. But some REIT subsectors, which have already outperformed the real estate industry so far in 2018, may continue to climb. The FTSE Nareit Equity Self Storage index .FTFN12 has risen 18.6 percent in the last six months and 10.6 percent year-to-date making it the biggest gainer in the sector. Self storage companies include Public Storage PSA.N, CubeSmart CUBE.N and Life Storage Inc LSI.N. Even with these gains, and an oversupply of capacity, self storage is still attractively valued, said Cedrik LaChance, Director of REIT Research at Green Street Advisors. “In the last seven to eight years self storage companies have become very adept at marketing online,” said Bob Zenouzi, a chief investment officer specializing in real estate at Macquarie Investment Management. “People can’t afford a home and need to downsize. You have stuff and need to store that stuff.” REITs that lease land to consumers who buy or rent manufactured residences such as mobile homes also stood out. The FTSE Nareit Equity Manufactured Homes index .FTFN19E has risen 16.3 percent in the last six months and 8 percent year-to-date. Companies in the sector include Equity Lifestyle Properties ELS.N and Sun Communities SUI.N. “We always love manufactured homes. It’s ignored by too many investors so it remains attractively priced,” said Green Street’s LaChance who sees low capital spending costs as a key advantage. “In real estate capex is really important and takes away a lot of the economics.” Macquarie’s Zenouzi says that hefty price tags for traditional houses are making manufactured homes more attractive to cash-strapped consumers. “Demographics are a tailwind because retirees want to downsize. House prices are up. These are lower cost options.” Hotel REITs have also done well though some investors are getting wary. They have been helped by a boost in business travel due to U.S. economic strength and recent U.S. corporate tax cuts. And when demand is strong, hotel REITs are better placed to quickly raise rates for short-term customers than REITs in long-lease sectors such as office or healthcare REITS. The FTSE Nareit Equity Lodging/Resorts index .FTFN24 rising 4.8 percent in the last six months and 6.4 percent year-to-date. But those gains may have run their course. “The share prices are effectively pricing in this rebound of corporate travel. Its priced in so aggressively we’re starting to see hotels as an expensive sector,” said LaChance. Even if there are bargains in REITS, John Laforge, head of real estate asset strategy at Wells Fargo Investment Institute, in Florida warned against getting “over your skis” in the broader sector. Instead he favors fast growing sectors like industrials, healthcare or technology. “We’re late in the economic cycle. It’s very classic for REITs to start underperforming,” said Laforge who recently downgraded the sector to ‘neutral” from a “favorable” rating."
