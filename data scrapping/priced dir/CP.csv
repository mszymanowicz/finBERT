11.092127188381536," UPDATE 1-Canadian Pacific profit misses estimates on lower freight volumes (Compares with estimates, adds details on operating ratio, 2020 forecast) Oct 20 (Reuters) - Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd missed Street estimates for quarterly profit on Tuesday, as the railroad operator was hurt by lower freight volumes during the COVID-19 pandemic. The company’s operating ratio, a measure of operating expenses as a percentage of revenue and a key metric for Wall Street, rose to 58.2% from 56.1% a year earlier. A lower operating ratio signals improved profitability. Canadian Pacific, however, said it expects at least mid-single-digit adjusted earnings growth in 2020. The pandemic compounded woes for rail operators, which moved record amounts of Canadian oil at the start of this year but witnessed a plunge in crude volumes later due to production cuts by energy companies. Canadian Pacific’s energy, chemicals and plastic shipments dropped 30% during the third quarter. Its total carloads, the amount of freight loaded into cars during a specified period, fell 7%. Net income fell 3.2% to C$598 million ($453.48 million), or C$4.41 per share, in the three months ended Sept. 30. Revenue declined by about 6% to C$1.86 billion.

15.746983355029078," Canadian Pacific quarterly profit beats estimates on lower costs (Reuters) - Canadian Pacific CP.TO on Wednesday reported second-quarter profit above estimates as lower costs helped the railroad cushion a drop in freight activity due the coronavirus crisis, and prompted it to raise its 2020 earnings forecast. Shares of Canadian Pacific were up 1% at C$368 in morning trading. The company’s operating ratio, a measure of operating expenses as a percentage of revenue and a key metric for Wall Street, fell to 57% from 58.4% a year earlier, as fuel expenses plunged 44%.

Canadian Pacific now expects its full-year adjusted earnings per share to rise this year, from its prior forecast of flat earnings. Canadian railroads were expected to benefit from a growth in crude shipments this year as oil producers looked for alternatives to congested pipelines. But the COVID-19 pandemic has sapped demand for crude, resulting in a 28% drop in the company’s energy, chemicals and plastic shipments.

Following the hit from the virus outbreak on business operations, Canada’s second-largest railroad operator now expects overall volumes to be down mid-single digits in 2020. “We are expecting low demand environment in North America and globally until recovery starts to ramp back up,” a company executive said on a post-earnings conference call. In the event of an extended or more widespread outbreak of the coronavirus, ratings agency Moody’s has warned railroads in North America will face lower demand for freight services, as the pandemic disrupts supply chains and slows down economic activity. Oil inventories have been building for weeks after Saudi Arabia and Russia early in March failed to come to terms on extending output cuts as the coronavirus pandemic worsened. Since that time, the pandemic’s spread has cut fuel demand by roughly 30% worldwide. U.S. crude oil futures collapsed below $0 on Monday for the first time in history, amid a coronavirus-induced supply glut, ending the day at a minus $37.63 a barrel as desperate traders paid to get rid of oil. However, Canadian Pacific’s freight revenue rose 15.9% to C$2 billion in the reported quarter as total carloads, the amount of freight loaded into cars during a specified period, rose 8.7%, boosted by higher energy, chemicals and plastic shipments.

-15.712894422473116," Canada to impose speed limits on trains carrying dangerous goods after crash OTTAWA/WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - Canada said on Thursday it would impose temporary speed limits on trains hauling dangerous goods after a Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd crude oil train derailed and caught fire. The accident, which happened in the early hours of Thursday near Guernsey, Saskatchewan, was the second derailment in the area in a span of two months. Federal Transport Minister Marc Garneau said that effective at midnight on Friday (0500 GMT Saturday), trains hauling more than 20 cars of dangerous goods would be limited to 25 miles per hour (40 kph) across the country for the next 30 days. The limit in urban areas will be 20 mph (32 kph), he told reporters. The reductions represent a halving from the normal speed limits. Depending on results of the probe into Thursday’s derailment, the 30-day period could be shortened or lengthened. “I realize there will be an effect on the economy of the country ... but it is very, very important that we do not sacrifice safety,” Garneau said. Canadian Pacific Chief Executive Keith Creel said he fully backed the move and had already implemented the slowdown. “Until we better understand the facts relating to today’s incident, it is prudent to operate with an abundance of caution,” he said in a statement. The company said there had been no injuries. Canada’s biggest railway, Canadian National Railway Co, will comply with the order and is reviewing its “significant impact on our operations,” spokesman Jonathan Abecassis said. Dangerous goods include crude oil that is diluted with condensate, gasoline, diesel, chemicals and some fertilizers, said John Zahary, chief executive of Altex Energy. The company operates terminals that load undiluted crude, which is not classified as a dangerous good. The order will have a knock-on effect through the transportation system as rail workers and locomotives are tied up on longer trips, he said by phone. “There is a finite number of people, of engineers driving the trains, a finite number of locomotives. So there is a direct impact on the dangerous goods, and maybe an indirect impact on everything else,” he said. “All that stuff is going to slow down.” In July 2013, 47 Canadians died in the Quebec town of Lac-Megantic after a train with oil tankers derailed and exploded."

-10.32290114242091," UPDATE 2-Canadian Pacific beats profit estimates, sees higher 2020 shipments from trade deal (Adds details from the conference call) Jan 29 (Reuters) - Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd topped analysts’ estimates for quarterly profit helped by higher freight revenue from crude shipments, and the company said it expects the U.S.-China trade deal to lift grain volumes in 2020 benefiting its sales. Canadian railroad operators are getting a boost from shipping oil for producers looking for alternatives to congested pipeline until recently when Alberta’s output cuts in January last year hurt crude-by-rail volumes. The volumes, however, started recovering after Alberta eased the curtailments in October and said it would allow companies to produce additional oil if they move it by rail. “This was..our largest crude-by-rail quarter in the company’s history, with over 36,000 carloads. We’re expecting a similar run rate as we look out to the first quarter and beyond,” CP Head of Marketing John Brooks said on a post-earnings call with analysts. Revenue in CP’s energy, chemicals and plastics segment, which also contains its crude-by-rail shipments, rose 33.1% to C$491 million. The company’s results come a day after larger rival Canadian National Railway Co also said it sees crude shipments as a growth driver in 2020. Progress in U.S.-China trade deal talks boosted volumes in CP’s U.S. business by 3% in the quarter, as soybean shipments to the Pacific Northwest rose. The company said it expects to continue to benefit in 2020 as China firms up purchases of U.S. goods. “Frankly, we’ve started to see a little bit of upside as some of the positive outcomes of this trade deal emerge,” a company executive said, adding that CP was anticipating an improvement in its U.S. grain business towards the end of the year. China is by far the world’s biggest soybean importer. Investors are awaiting signs of a pick-up in Chinese demand promised when Washington and Beijing signed the Phase 1 trade deal on Jan. 15. The company also forecast high single-digit to low double-digit adjusted earnings per share growth for 2020. CP earned adjusted earnings of $16.44 in 2019. Total carloads, the amount of freight loaded into cars during a specified period, fell 7.8% in the fourth quarter. However, the company posted a 10% rise in energy, chemicals and plastic shipments. Freight revenue rose 3% to $2.02 billion in the quarter. The company said net income rose to C$664 million ($505 million), or C$4.82 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, from C$545 million, or C$3.83 per share, a year earlier.

-17.1900395597449," Canadian Pacific crude train derails, catches fire in Saskatchewan (Reuters) - A Canadian Pacific Railway train hauling oil derailed west of Guernsey, Saskatchewan, early on Monday, spilling crude and causing a fire that was expected to burn into a second night. The train derailed around midnight in the western Canadian province, and an initial assessment indicated the accident did not affect any waterways, CP spokesman Andy Cummings said in a statement. He did not estimate the volume of crude the train was carrying or the magnitude of any spill. No injuries or damage to buildings occurred in the rural area, Royal Canadian Mounted Police Corporal Rob King said. Highway 16, a national highway, was still closed by midafternoon due to thick smoke from the fire, King said. A Reuters witness said the smoke was easily visible some 20 km (12 miles) away. The Saskatchewan Public Safety Agency said in a midafternoon statement that the focus was on suppressing fire that would likely burn for another eight to 10 hours. The agency said some cleanup of spilled oil had begun. One home was evacuated and some derailed cars were being removed. On social media, a Saskatchewan resident whose home is near the derailment, posted video during the night of towering fire and smoke from a blaze that stretched wide enough to encompass a dozen or more rail cars. Saskatchewan’s environment agency was monitoring air quality but did not issue any advisories, the safety agency said. Canada is the world’s fourth-largest crude oil producer, and shippers have moved more oil by train in the past year due to full pipelines. Canadian Transport Minister Marc Garneau wrote in a tweet that he was following the derailment’s aftermath closely and would prioritize safety. The Transportation Safety Board of Canada (TSB) said it had deployed investigators to the site to assess the incident. CP shares dipped 0.3% in Toronto."

19.00589288361514," CP Rail profit beats on lower fuel expenses, higher shipments (Reuters) - Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd CP.TO beat analysts' estimates for quarterly profit on Wednesday, driven by lower fuel expenses and higher shipments of coal, crude and fertilizers. CP said its operating ratio, a closely watched productivity metric that measures expenses as a percentage of revenue, fell 220 basis points to a record-low of 56.1% in the third quarter. The lower the ratio, the more efficient a railroad. Canada’s second-largest railroad operator said average fuel price fell 10% to $2.41 per gallon in the third quarter, leading to a 7.1% fall in fuel expenses. Total carloads, the amount of freight loaded into cars during a specified period, rose 1.4%, while rail freight revenue per carload increased nearly 3%, CP said. Revenue in the energy, chemicals and plastics segment, which also contains its crude-by-rail (CBR) shipments, rose about 13% to C$382 million in the quarter. While CBR shipments fell short of the company’s expectations, CP remained optimistic that the new Alberta government will come to a resolution on the transfer of its crude contract. The current government is trying to offload onto the private sector nearly C$4 billion of crude-by-rail contracts that were signed by the previous government, amounting to 120,000 barrels-per-day of crude. The company expects crude volumes to increase in the fourth from the third, it said on a post-earnings call. Larger rival Canadian National Railway Co CNR.TO also beat quarterly profit estimates but cut its adjusted earnings forecast for the year, citing declining freight demand in North America. CP, which maintained its full-year adjusted profit outlook, reduced its volume expectations to low-single digit revenue ton-mile (RTM) growth from mid-single digit RTM on delays in the Canadian grain harvest and export potash volumes. RTM measures the relative weight and distance of freight transported by a railroad. Canadian railway operators have been hit by a slew of problems, including lower-than-expected crude shipments and a late harvest of grains due to wet weather. CP said adjusted net income rose 8.7% to C$640 million ($490 million), or C$4.61 per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30. Analysts on average had estimated earnings of C$4.52, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Total revenue rose 4.3% to C$1.98 billion but fell short of analysts’ estimates of C$1.99 billion."

-11.385363498735577," Canadian Pacific beats on higher crude shipments, cost control (Reuters) - Canadian Pacific Railway reported a better-than-expected adjusted quarterly profit on Tuesday, as the country’s second-largest railroad operator controlled costs and earned more from moving crude, chemicals as well as plastics. The upbeat results come against the backdrop of Alberta government’s cap on output in January that boosted low crude prices, but made oil shipments by rail less profitable for Canadian producers. Narrow differentials between U.S. and Canadian crude discouraged shippers from moving it through rail, a more expensive form of transport than pipeline, between Alberta and higher-priced U.S. markets. Rail shipments have, however, recently recovered with some producers choosing rail again to avoid pipeline congestion. Crude-by-rail volumes jumped by about a quarter to 25,000 carloads in the second quarter, while total carloads, rail cars carrying freight, rose 6%. Alberta Premier Jason Kenney, who took office in April, has modestly eased the curtailments, with major Canadian oil companies also holding talks with the government on ending the mandatory cuts. In a post earnings call with analysts, Chief Executive Officer Keith Creel said a resolution to the output cuts would take “at least another couple of months, maybe more of our Q4 story.” “We expect volumes will continue to increase as production and curtailment balance stabilizes and our new contracts and existing customers continue to ramp up in the second half of the year,” Chief Marketing Officer John Brooks said. The company estimates crude carloads to ramp up to 30,000 in third quarter, with potential for upside. Revenue from energy, chemicals and plastics segment rose 22% on a currency adjusted basis in the second quarter. While U.S. grain shipment fell double digits as some export markets were challenged due to the lingering trade dispute with China, the company said it expects upside in grain in the third quarter. CP’s operating ratio, which measures expenses as a percentage of revenue, also improved by 580 basis point to 58.4%. Revenue jumped 13% to C$1.98 billion ($1.52 billion). Adjusted income rose to C$4.30 per share, above the average analyst estimate of C$4.18. CP shares were up more than 3% on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the New York Stock Exchange.

8.388884867318282," Canadian Pacific Railway profit misses as harsh winter raises costs (Reuters) - Canadian Pacific Railway Ltd missed analysts’ estimates for quarterly profit on Tuesday as the railroad operator spent heavily to combat a harsh winter that impacted its operations. Canada’s challenging winter conditions extended to February, with a winter storm dumping heavy snow and ice pellets on the most populated parts of the country, paralyzing transportation. The operations of the second-largest railroad operator in Canada was also hampered in February by a derailment in British Columbia’s Rocky Mountains, a busy part of the company’s network, killing three crew members. Overall operating expenses, which included casualty costs of C$69 million, rose 9 percent to C$1.22 billion ($908.4 million) in the first quarter. This resulted in its operating ratio, a closely watched productivity metric that measures expenses as a percentage of revenue, to rise 180 basis points to 69.3 percent. The lower the ratio, the more efficient a railroad is. Total carloads, the amount of freight loaded into cars during a specified period, fell 2 percent in the first quarter, the company said. Crude-by-rail shipments also declined 17,000 carloads sequentially as Alberta’s forced output cuts resulted in narrow differentials between Canadian crude and U.S. crude prices, making it uneconomical for oil producers to ship crude by rail. In the second quarter, CP however sees shipments to get back up to 20,000 to 25,000 carloads, Chief Financial Officer Nadeem Velani said in a conference call with analysts. The railroad operator currently has contracts with oil-producing province of Alberta and oil producers such as Suncor Energy and Cenovus Energy to ship crude by rail as an alternative amid pipeline congestion. However, uncertainty around Alberta’s contracts has gained ground after United Conservative Party leader Jason Kenney who had vowed to rip up the contracts won the provincial election. “We spent...a fair amount of time working with the Alberta government in putting this contract together. I didn’t do it to have it be ripped up,” said Velani. The company said net income rose to C$434 million, or C$3.09 per share, in the three months ended March 31, from C$348 million, or C$2.41 per share, a year earlier.
