30.713649079836504," Gray Television withdraws Tegna offer amid coronavirus rout: sources (Reuters) - Gray Television Inc GTN.N has withdrawn its offer to acquire larger peer Tegna Inc TGNA.N because of concerns about the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on U.S. regional TV station operators, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. Gray had offered to buy Tegna for about $8.5 billion, including debt, Reuters reported earlier this month. After Gray’s stock tumbled on the news and concerns about the coronavirus pandemic’s financial impact became widespread, the Atlanta-based company decided this was not the time to pursue the transformative acquisition, one of the sources said. Private equity firm Apollo Global Management Inc APO.N and media mogul Byron Allen, which also had made $20-per-share all-cash offers for Tegna, remain in contention to buy the company and deal negotiations are continuing, the sources said. Tegna has been engaging with bidders and allowing them to carry out due diligence, the sources added. There is no certainty there will be a deal for Tegna, given the economic uncertainty brought about by the coronavirus crisis, the sources said, asking not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Tegna, Gray, Apollo and Allen all declined to comment. While the regional TV sector is benefiting from increased political advertising this year ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November, TV advertising budgets have been in decline as media consumption shifts to the internet and online streaming. This decline could accelerate should the coronavirus outbreak weigh on consumer spending and the appetite of advertisers to woo them. Only 67% of U.S. households still have traditional pay-TV subscriptions, according to a PwC report published last year. The decline in traditional viewership has led to a wave of consolidation as companies compete for viewers. Tegna, a spinoff of Gannett Co Inc's GCI.N broadcasting and digital arm, runs 62 television stations in 51 U.S. markets, and reaches 39% of television households in the United States. Apollo’s Cox assets include 13 TV stations and 54 radio stations across 10 markets. Apollo also owns Northwest Broadcasting, which owns 20 TV stations. Allen, who acquired the Weather Channel TV network for $300 million in 2018, owns 15 stations in smaller markets. Standard General, a hedge fund that owns roughly 9.7% of Tegna, has been pushing the company to sell itself and is seeking to get directors on its board. Investment firms HG Vora Capital Management and Donerail Group have also been pushing for changes at Tegna."
13.213813107441208," Exclusive: Gray Television in $8.5 billion bid to acquire Tegna - sources (Reuters) - U.S. regional TV station operator Gray Television Inc GTN.N has made an offer to acquire larger peer Tegna Inc TGNA.N for approximately $8.5 billion, including debt, people familiar with the matter said on Friday. A successful bid by Atlanta-based Gray would significantly expand its footprint in several TV markets. It underscores the pressure Gray and other companies in the TV station industry are under to gain scale and pricing power with advertisers and the major networks. While the sector is benefiting from increased political advertising this year ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November, TV advertising budgets have been in decline as media consumption shifts to the internet and online streaming. Gray, which has a market capitalization of $1.5 billion, has offered about $20 per share in cash and stock for Tegna, two of the sources said. The acquisition financing would add to Gray’s $3.8 billion debt pile, but the company has a plan to quickly pay down debt should the deal be completed, one of the sources added. After Reuters reported on Gray's bid on Friday, private equity firm Apollo Global Management Inc APO.N informed Tegna it was also prepared to offer $20 per share to buy the company, but its bid would be all-cash, the sources said. Apollo made a big bet on the sector last year, acquiring the TV and radio stations of Cox Enterprises Inc for more than $3 billion, including debt. There is no certainty that Tegna, which has a market capitalization of $3.7 billion and outstanding debt of $4.2 billion, will accept either offer, or that it will successfully negotiate a deal, the sources said. A deal with Gray or Apollo would require divestitures, according to the sources. The sources asked not to be identified because the matter is confidential. Virginia-based Tegna declined to comment, while Gray and Apollo did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Tegna shares ended trading on Friday up 26.5% at $17. Gray shares ended down 4.4% at $15.06. Only 67% of U.S. households still have traditional pay-TV subscriptions, according to a PwC report published last year. The decline in traditional viewership has led to a wave of consolidation as companies compete for viewers. Last year, Nexstar Media Group Inc NXST.O acquired Tribune Media Company for $7.2 billion, including debt, while Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc SBGI.O acquired Walt Disney Co's DIS.N 21 regional sports networks for $10.6 billion, including debt. Tegna, a spinoff of Gannett Co Inc's GCI.N broadcasting and digital arm, runs 62 television stations in 51 U.S. markets, and reaches 39% of television households in the United States. Atlanta-based Gray Television operates in 93 television markets and covers about 24% of U.S. television households. Gray is generally present in smaller markers and Tegna is present in larger markets, making their combination complementary and more likely to be approved by regulators, one of the sources said. Apollo’s Cox assets include 13 TV stations and 54 radio stations across ten markets. Apollo also owns Northwest Broadcasting, which owns 20 TV stations. Last month, the companies announced a deal for Gray to acquire a minority stake in Premion, Tegna’s over-the-top advertising platform for advertisers. As part of this agreement, Gray will serve as a reseller of Premion’s services across all of its markets. The sources said Gray’s offer for the entirety of Tegna was not affected by the partnership the companies clinched in advertising. Standard General, a hedge fund that owns roughly 9.7% of Tegna, has been pushing the company to sell itself and is seeking to get directors on its board. Investment firms HG Vora Capital Management and Donerail Group have also been pushing for changes at Tegna. “We believe that the Tegna board, with the assistance of independent advisers, needs to run a full and fair process to explore all alternatives to maximize value for all shareholders,” Standard General founding partner Soo Kim said in a statement. For the 2019 fourth quarter, Tegna reported adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $229 million, at the high end of the range it had provided in its preliminary results, albeit down $44 million year-on-year. The company has guided for revenue growth in 2021 in the mid-to-high 20% range, compared with 2019."
-12.391939356773806," Gray Television well placed for U.S. election ad deluge: Barron's NEW YORK (Reuters) - Broadcasting company Gray Television Inc GTN.N is well placed to profit from an anticipated deluge of political advertising ahead of U.S. elections in 2020, according to Barron's. The U.S. financial newspaper said good ratings in its local TV markets would be attractive to congressional, senatorial, gubernatorial and presidential campaigns looking to place adverts. “For investors, that potential pickup in revenue and a discounted stock price make for a winning ticket,” Barron’s wrote. Shares in Gray Television are up around 15% so far in 2019 but are down 25% in the last three months, giving the company a market capitalization of $1.7 billion. A representative for Gray Television did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the Barron’s report."

At the time the deal was announced in June, the two companies had a combined 142 full-power television stations in 92 markets, reaching about 24 percent of total U.S. television households. The divestiture conditions were included in a proposed settlement the Antitrust Division filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia along with a lawsuit seeking to block the merger, the Justice Department statement said. The settlement, if approved by the court, would require divestitures in Knoxville, Tennessee; Toledo, Ohio; Waco–Temple–Bryan, Texas; Tallahassee, Florida–Thomasville, Georgia; Augusta, Georgia; Odessa-Midland, Texas; Panama City, Florida; Albany, Georgia; and Dothan, Alabama."

18.85520280774055," Gray Television to buy Raycom Media in $3.65 billion deal (Reuters) - Gray Television Inc said on Monday it would buy privately held rival broadcaster Raycom Media Inc in a cash-and-stock deal valued at $3.65 billion, in a push into more local television markets and to attract additional advertising. The combined company, with 142 full-power television stations in 92 markets, will reach about 24 percent of total U.S. television households, more than doubling Gray’s reach. Shares in Gray jumped 16 percent to close at a four-month high of $14.85. Gray’s largest deal comes at a time when the U.S. Federal Communications Commission is making it easier for media companies to buy TV stations in the same market, and for local stations to jointly sell advertising time. In November, the FCC voted to remove certain roadblocks to increased consolidation among media companies, potentially unleashing new deals among TV, radio and newspaper owners as they seek to better compete with online media. “We believe all the broadcasters could eventually become targets for larger tech or telecom companies over time, especially as content generation increases,” said Daniel Kurnos, an analyst at Benchmark Co. Another major broadcaster Sinclair Broadcast Group Inc is awaiting approval from FCC and U.S. Justice Department for its $3.9 billion acquisition of Tribune Media Co. Gray’s offer for Raycom, an employee-owned company, will consist of $2.85 billion in cash, $650 million in a new series of preferred stock, and 11.5 million shares of Gray common stock, the companies said. Wells Fargo has underwritten $2.53 billion in debt financing for the deal. The deal will create the third largest portfolio of stations and markets in the United States, Gray said. Gray said it will divest television stations in each of the nine overlapping markets to get antitrust approval for the deal, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2018. Raycom plans to sell or spin off Community Newspaper Holdings Inc, its unit that owns community newspapers, as well as PureCars, a digital ad platform for the automotive industry. Gray said it will not acquire neither unit as part of the deal. Raycom President and Chief Executive Officer Pat LaPlatney will become Gray’s president and co-chief executive officer, along with Gray CEO Hilton Howell."
