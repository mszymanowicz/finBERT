1.2524249351668193," Proxy advisory firms urge Dine Brands investors to reject activist's IHOP plan BOSTON (Reuters) - Two influential proxy advisory firms said Dine Brands Global Inc DIN.N shareholders should reject a proposal to spin off its IHOP pancake house chain in a rebuke to activist investment firm JCP Investment Partnership which proposed the plan. Institutional Shareholder Services and Glass Lewis both recommended votes against JCP’s shareholder proposal that Glendale, California-based Dine hire an investment bank in order to turn IHOP into a separately traded public company, the two reports, which were seen by Reuters on Wednesday, say. The firms’ recommendations carry considerable weight with investors who will cast votes at Dine’s annual meeting on May 12. ISS and Glass Lewis both said JCP’s arguments that Dine would be better off letting the pancake house chain become a standalone company were not convincing. Dine also owns Applebee’s Grill & Bar in addition to IHOP. JCP “has not provided a thorough quantitative assessment to support its arguments,” the Glass Lewis report said, adding “this proposal is overly prescriptive and would limit the board’s ability to fully consider other potential strategic alternatives.” JCP’s shareholder proposal became public in a regulatory filing earlier this month and has not gained much traction at a time most U.S. restaurants have largely been ordered to shut in order to help slow the spread of the coronavirus. The investment firm did not respond to a request for comment and a spokesman for Dine declined to comment. ISS said bluntly that hiring an investment bank now to try and spin off a restaurant chain at a time few people are dining out would be a waste of time and money. “Hiring an investment banker to effect a spinoff of IHOP may not be considered a prudent use of board and management resources at this time,” the report said. JCP, a Houston-based firm run by James Pappas, argued that “the valuation increase and potential earnings increase for IHOP would vastly outweigh the existing synergies associated with keeping IHOP and Applebee’s together.” Much has changed for investors after a historic stock-market selloff and as 26 million U.S. jobs were lost in the last five weeks. Many activist investors have quickly and often quietly dropped demands for change to let management navigate the crisis. The Pappas family has deep roots in the restaurant business as James' father, Christopher Pappas, is president and chief executive officer of restaurant chain Luby’s Inc LUB.N, which operates the Fuddruckers chain among others."
86.71428095238097," JCP Partners asks Dine Brands to spin off IHOP in shareholder proposal BOSTON (Reuters) - Activist investment firm JCP Investment Partnership is urging Dine Brands Global Inc DIN.N to spin off its IHOP pancake house restaurant chain at a time restaurants have largely been ordered to shut in order to help slow the spread of the coronavirus. The Houston-based investment firm told the Glendale, California-based company that its two chains - IHOP and Applebee’s Grill & Bar - do not fit together and IHOP should be turned into a standalone company. JCP made a shareholder proposal which was made public in a regulatory filing by Dine late on Wednesday. The company’s shareholder meeting is scheduled for May 12. “We believe that a spin-off of IHOP into a separately traded public company could create significant stockholder value and urge stockholders to vote FOR this proposal,” JCP’s shareholder proposal said. In the same filing, the company’s board urged shareholders to vote against the proposal. JCP argues that Applebee's has been a drag on growth and that other restaurant chains have successfully spun off segments, including Darden Restaurants Inc DRI.N which sold Red Lobster to a private equity company in 2014. “We believe that the valuation increase and potential earnings increase for IHOP would vastly outweigh the existing synergies associated with keeping IHOP and Applebee’s together,” JCP said in the filing. JCP is run by James Pappas whose family has deep roots in the restaurant business as his father, Christopher Pappas, is president and chief executive officer of restaurant chain Luby's Inc LUB.N, which operates the Fuddruckers chain among others. JCP did not immediately respond to a request for comment and a spokesman for Dine Brands declined to comment beyond the filing. Any spinoff would come with considerable costs and also accelerate the repayment of debt. It would come with a make-whole premium of more than $90 million, which is roughly one-third of the company’s current $369 million market capitalization. The company has $1.3 billion in senior secured notes. The shareholder proposal was publicized just hours before the U.S. government announced that jobless claims surged to 6.6 million people last week. Restaurant workers have been hit hard as restaurants across the country have been forced to close dining rooms in observance of “social distancing” used to slow the spread of the coronavirus."

-10.114401427328549," Dine Brands to accelerate IHOP pancake unit expansion in India (Reuters) - Restaurant chain Applebee's owner Dine Brands Group DIN.N plans to speed up the pace of opening its IHOP pancake outlets in India, following a strong response to its first restaurant in the northern Indian city of Gurugram opened last year. Chief Executive Officer Steve Joyce told Reuters that the expansion was part of a strategy to expand in markets seeing more people go out for breakfast. “We think IHOP has unique opportunities here because breakfast is an important meal in India,” Joyce said during a visit to inaugurate the second IHOP store in India in a mall in the country’s capital New Delhi. Joyce, who previously laid out plans to open 20 IHOPs in India by 2025, now expects to open 15 IHOP outlets in the next three to four years and grow it to a hundred within at least seven years. The first IHOP outlet in India had “exceeded” the company’s expectations and was already running a profit eight months after opening, said a source close to the company, who asked not to be named because the details are confidential. In India, breakfast is a meal traditionally prepared and consumed at home, but trends are changing as the country, with more than half its population below 30 years, preferring to dine out as disposable incomes rise. This shift has helped breakfast emerge as one of the fastest-growing meal categories in the Indian dining industry. Fourteen percent of Indians have had breakfast outside home at least three to four times a week in 2016, compared with 9.6 percent in 2015, according to a survey by market research firm Euromonitor international’s global consumer trends unit. The growing market has seen companies including McDonald's MCD.N introduce items such as the masala dosa brioche – an all-day offering that combines a staple south Indian breakfast dish called masala dosa in a burger-style serving. Analysts covering Dine Brands said tapping India could be a growth vehicle for the company at a time when IHOP’s North American sales have plateaued with comparable sales ranging from down low-single digits to up low-single digits over the past few years. But configuring its dishes to an Indian palate that usually prefers savory dishes over sweet would be IHOP’s biggest challenge. “India is a huge potential market but getting the menu mix right could prove to be tricky,” said research firm Retail Metrics founder Ken Perkins."
