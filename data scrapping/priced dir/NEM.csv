30.9401384370743," Golden quarter for miners Newmont, Barrick as high prices help profit beat (Reuters) - Newmont Corp and Barrick Gold Corp unveiled higher dividends as the world’s top two gold producers share with investors the benefits of higher prices for the metal after trouncing Wall Street earnings estimates. A 25% surge in gold prices last year, supported by unprecedented stimulus measures, has offered miners a lifeline following production disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Cost-conscious executives are also prioritizing investor returns over production growth, hesitating to spend on pricey projects that often take years to break even. Newmont raised its quarterly dividend by 38% and pledged to return up to 60% of incremental free cash flow to shareholders, provided gold prices stay above $1,200 per ounce. Barrick left its quarterly payout unchanged at 9 cents per share, while proposing a $750 million special dividend for 2021 after it sold assets worth $1.5 billion last year. The special payout provided an opportunity for Barrick to assess the economic environment before deciding on any formal dividend policy, the Toronto-based miner’s Chief Executive Officer Mark Bristow told Reuters. Barrick’s capital return plan comes days after Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc exited its stake in the miner. While Bristow did not comment on the Berkshire move, he said there remains significant interest from generalist funds in the stock. The miner’s Canada-listed shares rose about 21% through 2020, while Newmont gained about 39%. The stocks have given up some gains since the start of this year as COVID-19 vaccine roll-outs buoyed investor confidence in other assets. Graphic: Newmont, Barrick shares largely outperformed gold prices since COVID-19 pandemic - On an adjusted basis, Barrick earned 35 cents per share for the reported quarter, beating estimates of 32 cents, according to Refinitiv IBES data. Newmont reported a profit of $1.06 per share, excluding items, compared with estimates of 95 cents."
30.9401384370743," UPDATE 2-Golden quarter for Newmont as high prices double profit (Compares with estimates, adds background) Feb 18 (Reuters) - Gold miner Newmont Corp beat Wall Street estimates for fourth-quarter profit on Thursday, as higher prices for the precious metal fueled by the pandemic countered a drop in production largely due to asset sales. The metal’s appeal as a hedge against inflation helped power a 25% gain in 2020 when global central banks and governments rolled out unprecedented stimulus measures to cushion the COVID-19 pandemic’s economic blow. The world’s largest gold miner’s adjusted profit more than doubled to $856 million in the last quarter of 2020, while attributable gold production fell 11% to 1.6 million ounces. Rival Barrick earlier on Thursday reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit on soaring gold prices. Newmont said averaged realized gold prices climbed to $1,852 per ounce in the quarter, from $1,478 per ounce a year earlier. The company, which reiterated its 2021 production outlook of 6.5 million ounces, cited the sale of Red Lake and Kalgoorlie mines, as well as the placing of its Yanacocha and Cerro Negro mines in temporary care and maintenance due to the pandemic for the drop in 2020 output. All-in sustaining cost, a closely watched industry benchmark, rose 10% to $1,043 per ounce in the quarter, in part due to higher sustaining capital needs at its Boddington gold mine in Western Australia. On an adjusted Newmont earned $1.06 per share in the three months ended Dec.31, beating estimates 95 cents, according to Refinitiv IBES data."

-6.805964345670186," Gold miner Newmont to spend $500 million over 5 years on climate initiatives (Reuters) -Top gold producer Newmont Corp on Tuesday said it would spend $500 million over five years to meet climate change targets as the miner accelerates efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at its operations. Investors are putting pressure on gold miners, whose high greenhouse gas emissions have been less scrutinized, to report transparently and take concrete steps to curb them after a rally in prices this year drew closer attention to the sector’s footprint. Newmont last month committed to a 30% reduction in carbon emissions by 2030, and net zero emissions by 2050. The company said it is studying solar and wind installations at several mines, including Peñasquito in Mexico and Ahafo in Ghana, and ways to boost efficiencies across its operations. “It’s about putting money where our mouth is,” Chief Executive Tom Palmer said on a call, adding the spending represents a starting point and would be a mix of development and operating capital. Newmont earlier forecast higher production of the precious metal next year at lower costs. Prices for safe haven gold have surged nearly 23% this year as global economies reeled under lockdowns designed to curb the spread of the coronavirus outbreak. Newmont forecast 2021 gold output of 6.5 million ounces, up from the 6 million ounces it expects to report this year. While output was hit in some regions this year due to infections and governmental restrictions, Newmont said its forecast assumes operations will continue without major coronavirus-related interruptions next year and beyond. Output through 2023 is forecast between 6.2 million and 6.7 million ounces, rising to as much as 7 million ounces through 2025. Spending is forecast to increase sharply to $1.8 billion driven by expansions in Ghana and Peru. All-in sustaining cost, a closely watched industry benchmark, is expected to be around $970 per ounce of gold mined next year, below this year’s forecast of $1,015 per ounce. The cost is expected to further decrease through 2025."

There has been increasing pressure from investors and environmental groups on the mining industry to tackle issues such as climate change and pollution. Newmont, which also aims a 30% cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, said it would implement a new energy and climate investment standard to ensure that the targets are embedded into investment decisions related to fleet vehicles, production equipment and onsite renewable power generation. Newmont said 88% of its energy used for mining and milling is generated from carbon-based fuels. Earlier this year, BHP Group BHP.AX, the world's biggest listed miner, said it would focus on cutting its operational emissions by 30% by the 2030 financial year from 2020 levels, and link executive bonuses to its progress."

Gold prices XAU= touched record highs during the quarter as a slowdown in economic activity and surging coronavirus cases sent investors to the precious metal, long seen as a hedge against inflation and currency debasement. The miner said its average realized gold price jumped 30% to $1,913 per ounce in the third quarter, while attributable gold production fell 6% to 1.54 million ounces. Excluding items, the Colorado-based company earned 86 cents per share in the quarter, up from 36 cents per share a year ago.

Gold prices have scaled record peaks this year as the coronavirus crisis slams the global economy, with tensions between Beijing and Washington further boosting the appeal of the metal, long seen as a hedge against inflation and currency debasement. Newmont’s averaged realized gold price jumped about 31% to $1,724 per ounce in the second quarter ended June 30. Its attributable gold production, however, fell 21% to 1.26 million ounces as coronavirus lockdowns led to the temporary closure of some of its mine sites. Newmont had warned in May it would record its lowest quarterly output and highest costs this year in the second quarter due to the pandemic. The company will spend $45 million per month to maintain safety protocols at its mines and is particularly worried about community spread of the virus in Mexico, Peru and Argentina, CEO Tom Palmer said on a call. Latin America has become the region most impacted by the pandemic globally, with 26.83% of worldwide cases. “This virus is nasty. It’s terribly contagious. And we are keeping those protocols in place,” Palmer said.

The world’s biggest gold miner said average realized price for gold in the first quarter rose to $1,591 per ounce from $1,300 an ounce last year, while attributable gold production rose 20% to 1.5 million ounce mainly due to new output from the Goldcorp mines that it acquired last year. Gold prices have risen around 12% this year, as investors shifted their investments to the metal after risk sentiment took a beating due to uncertainties in a coronavirus-hit global economy. This has helped shares of gold miners to outpace broader stock indexes this year, despite shutting down production due to the virus-led lockdowns across the globe. S&P/TSX’s Global Gold index, which tracks producers of gold and related products, including companies that mine or process gold globally, has gained about 36% on an average in this quarter, compared to last year. Newmont’s stock is up about 44% this year as of Monday’s close.

6.68610353893416," Newmont to reopen some Canadian, South American mines in 'days or weeks' MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Newmont Corp NEM.N is looking to restart in as soon as days some of the four Canadian and South American gold mines that it shut last month to curb the spread of the new coronavirus, Chief Executive Tom Palmer said on Friday. The world’s biggest gold miner wound down operations at its Yanacocha mine in Peru in mid-March and a week later placed two more mines in Canada and one in Argentina on care and maintenance as it sought to safe-guard the health of its workers and comply with government regulations. The move, which impacted its Musselwhite operations in northern Ontario, and Eléonore mine in Quebec as well as Cerro Negro in Argentina, came as it withdrew its full-year guidance and said some production could be deferred into 2021. On April 4 the company said it would scale back operations at its Penasquito gold mine in Mexico. But as the coronavirus shows signs of peaking, and authorities in Buenos Aires and Quebec City have lifted restrictions around mining which they have deemed as an “essential service”, Newmont is looking to a phased restart, Palmer said. “I would expect we would be able to bring operations that have been on care and maintenance back into some level of production,” Palmer told Reuters by phone from Perth. “In those countries where restrictions have been lifted... it is days or weeks,” he said, without specifying how long other mines may take to restart. The novel coronavirus has impacted miners globally as governments have shut down borders and transport and mandated people stay at home to curb the spread of the virus that has infected more than 2 million and killed over 143,000, according to a Reuters tally. Palmer also said that discussions were continuing with all levels of government as well as local communities in countries “to ensure we can demonstrate that we can maintain through our protocols the health and safety of everyone involved”. Argentine President Alberto Fernandez, who imposed a country-wide lockdown in mid-March, has moved to put mining on a list of essential sectors, although the virus has snarled transport and miners’ logistics. Canada’s Quebec province announced on Monday it would redesignate mining an essential service starting on Wednesday while in northern Ontario mining is already seen as essential. In Peru, which imposed a national state of emergency in mid-March, the Antamina copper mine controlled by BHP BHP.AX and Glencore GLEN.L said on Monday that it would halt all operations for at least two weeks to stem the spread of the virus. Palmer said Newmont was in talks with governments including in Peru and Mexico, about the importance of mining to the economy and communities. (This story corrects last name of CEO throughout.)"

The blockade hit Penasquito’s third-quarter production by some 11,000 gold ounces, 1.7 million silver ounces, 13.7 million pounds of lead and 22.8 million pounds of zinc, the world’s biggest gold producer said in a statement. “The company continues to work closely with the federal and state governments toward a sustainable, long-term solution, and lifting of the blockade paves the way for the government-sponsored dialogue to resume,” Newmont Goldcorp said. The mine, one of Newmont Goldcorp’s largest, has suffered on and off blockades in recent years, most recently linked to truckers and claims its operations have affected local water supplies. Newmont Goldcorp has long accused local leaders and politicians of exploiting social causes to extort the company. The company said operations would remain temporarily suspended pending “further evaluation of the situation on the ground and assurances that the blockade will not be allowed to resume.” In September, Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador accused some of the protest leaders of seeking money rather than legitimate social goals. He asked the parties involved in the conflict to resolve their differences.

Operations at the open-pit mine located in northern Zacatecas state, which produced 272,000 ounces of gold last year, have been suspended since last weekend because of a blockade by protesters. “We have made a very generous offer of social investment, but the blockade leaders are demanding hundreds of millions of dollars in cash for themselves,” said Michael Harvey, director of external relations for Newmont Goldcorp Mexico. Felipe Pinedo, a local leader who has helped organize blockades of the mine in the past, denied Harvey’s allegation in a phone interview with Reuters. “The problem isn’t an issue of money; it’s an issue of life,” said Pinedo. “The people here are clear: They will accept the projects but give us back our water.” He argued that the company’s spending in the surrounding Cedros community was a fraction of the profits from the mine that leave Mexico. The Newmont Goldcorp proposal put forward at negotiations with the community include a 30-year pledge to operate a water treatment plant, a 12-year deal to lease local land and the promise to invest in a production or infrastructure project, the company said in a statement. The mine directly employs more than 6,500 people, including 315 local residents, the company added. Penasquito accounts for about 17 percent of Newmont Goldcorp’s net asset value, according to a Scotiabank estimate from earlier this year. Operations at the mine have been intermittent since March due to protests. Some protest leaders said they wanted payment to compensate for damage to the local water supply.

2.8085678215598673," Newmont CEO says Goldcorp mines need about three years of development, exploration work TORONTO (Reuters) - Newmont Goldcorp NEM.N needs to do as much as three years of work at the mines it added through its acquisition of Goldcorp to bring them to acceptable levels of performance, its chief executive told Reuters on Thursday. The company reported a substantial decline in second-quarter profit, driven largely by the transaction’s integration costs. Shares dropped 3.4% to $37.98 at 1:44 p.m. in New York. “Goldcorp had really cut back to zero its spend on exploration a few years ago, when the gold price turned down,” Chief Executive Officer Gary Goldberg, who will be replaced by President Tom Palmer on Oct. 1, said in an interview. “Right around the mine areas, they hadn’t done the detailed exploration work that sets you up for longer term.” Goldcorp had also taken a “just-in-time” approach to mine development, meaning any hiccups led to production problems, Goldberg said. Newmont is currently integrating operations after it finalized its acquisition of Goldcorp and its Nevada joint venture with Barrick Gold Corp ABX.TOGOLD.N in the second quarter. The Denver-based company said it expects attributable gold production of 6.5 million ounces for 2019, at an all-in sustaining cost (AISC) of $975 an ounce, excluding production at its joint venture, Nevada Gold Mines. This takes into account the work needed at and around the Goldcorp mines, Goldberg said. Newmont will provide an update on its guidance for subsequent years in December, he said. Net income attributable to shareholders from continuing operations sank to just $1 million, or zero cents a share, in the three months ended June 30, from $274 million, or 51 cents a share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected $188.58 million, or 23 cents a share, according to Refinitiv data. Costs incurred while Newmont’s Penasquito mine in Mexico and Musselwhite in Canada were idle, due to a blockade and a conveyor fire respectively, contributed to the decline. “Results appear disappointing at first look -- even allowing for noise from Goldcorp consolidation and Penasquito (blockade),” said analysts at Citi, who have a ‘buy’ rating on the stock, in a note. “We expect 2019 to be a transition year for Newmont... The key is to exit 2019 with plans in place and demonstrate execution on synergies and operating improvements in 2020-21.” Second-quarter gold production surged 37% from a year earlier to 1.59 million ounces, with AISC of $1,016 an ounce, while the average realized gold price rose by $25 to $1,317 per ounce. Newmont posted revenue of $2.26 billion, compared with $1.66 billion a year ago and analyst estimates for $2.38 billion. This month, Barrick said the Nevada joint venture is expected to produce 1.8 million to 1.9 million ounces of gold in the second half of 2019."

The operations, which include 10 underground and 12 open pit mines in the southwestern U.S. state and rank as the largest global gold producing complex, had produced a total of 4.1 million ounces of gold in 2018. Barrick and Newmont agreed to form the joint venture in Nevada in March after Barrick withdrew its $18 billion offer for its rival, ending a hostile takeover bid that sought to unite the world’s two largest gold producers. Barrick and Newmont Goldcorp have 61.5% and 38.5% stakes, respectively, in the joint venture, which was officially launched on Monday. Barrick, which also operates the joint venture, Nevada Gold Mines LLC, estimates cost of sales there in the range of $940 to $970 per ounce, while all in sustaining costs are expected to be $920 to $950 per ounce for the second half of the year. By combining their operations, Barrick and Newmont had hoped to save more than $5 billion over the next 20 years, at a time when gold miners have struggled with a loss of investor confidence and constraints on funding projects. Barrick said on Monday that it expected to deliver cost savings of up to $500 million per year over the first five years from 2020, which will fall thereafter."
9.7344460981908," Newmont Goldcorp resumes operations at Peñasquito gold mine in Mexico (Reuters) - Newmont Goldcorp said on Monday it had resumed shipping concentrate from the Peñasquito gold mine in Mexico after a blockade by a trucking contractor and some members of the Cedros community was lifted. Operations at the mine were temporarily suspended since April 29. Delivery of supplies to the site have also resumed, Newmont said, adding that the downtime from the suspension was used to bring forward maintenance on some systems and equipment. Truck drivers have blocked access to the mine since March 27 and the protesters say its operations caused a water supply to dry up. At the end of April the company suspended production, then payments and benefits to villages surrounding the site. The temporary shutdown had worried some analysts on the expected impact on 2019 production. However, the company has so far provided any figures surrounding it. The open-pit mine, in northern Zacatecas state, produced 272,000 ounces of gold in 2018, company figures show. It accounts for about 17 percent of Newmont Goldcorp’s net asset value, according to Scotiabank. The mine was part of the portfolio of Goldcorp, whose acquisition Newmont completed in April to become the world’s biggest gold producer."

23.095821070025035," Newmont Goldcorp to suspend Peñasquito operations in Mexico due to blockade (Reuters) - Newmont Goldcorp Corp said on Monday it plans to suspend operations at its Peñasquito mine in Mexico due to a blockade by a trucking contractor and some members of the Cedros community. The open-pit mine, in northern Zacatecas state, produced 272,000 ounces of gold in 2018, company figures show. It accounts for about 17 percent of Newmont Goldcorp’s net asset value, according to Scotiabank. The blockade began on March 27, the company said in a statement, adding that it was working with Mexican authorities to resolve the issue. Newmont Goldcorp shares were down 2.7 percent to $30.61 by mid-afternoon in New York trading. “This increases uncertainty surrounding 2019 operating outlook, and the company has not provided guidance on potential timing for a restart of normal operations or expected impact on 2019 production,” Stephen Walker, head of global mining research at RBC Dominion Securities, said in a note. Peñasquito also accounts for 13 percent of the asset value of streaming company Wheaton Precious Metals, according to Scotiabank. The mine is part of the portfolio of Goldcorp, whose acquisition Newmont completed this month to become the world’s biggest gold producer. On the company’s first-quarter results call last week, Newmont Goldcorp Chief Operating Officer Tom Palmer said the blockade stemmed from concerns in the local community about water supply and “some issues around a trucking contractor.” Felipe Pinedo, a leader of the blockade, told Reuters residents were determined that the mine “should go” if the local water supply was not restored and guaranteed. Around 1,000 people and 200 trucks were taking turns to enforce the blockade, Pinedo said. “We expect this to grow,” he added. Last June, Goldcorp faced a protest led by local truck drivers who blocked entry to the Peñasquito mine. They said Goldcorp had reneged on promises to hire locally, but lifted the blockade two weeks later, saying they would negotiate with the company. In 2017, a group of local residents blocked access to the mine for more than a week, demanding the company make good on a commitment to supply nearby communities with water. Goldcorp later said it was able to resume operations without a hit to production. Peñasquito is the second of Newmont Goldcorp’s mines to have its operations suspended, with the Musselwhite mine in Ontario, which accounts for 7 percent of production, shut after a fire in March."
21.42422431653917," Newmont Goldcorp profit beats on higher production as prices fall (Reuters) - Newmont Goldcorp , the world’s biggest gold miner, reported a higher-than-expected first-quarter profit on Thursday, as a boost in gold production and lower costs countered lagging gold prices. At a time when easy-to-find gold reserves are dwindling, Newmont shored up its production pipeline through the $10 billion acquisition of Goldcorp Inc, which closed last week. Newmont Goldcorp did not provide a production outlook or costs for the combined company for this year. It reiterated its outlook for only Newmont, saying all-in sustaining costs will be $935 per ounce, rising from $909 last year, while production will rise marginally to 5.2 million ounces, from 5.1 million last year. Chief Executive Gary Goldberg said on an analyst call the combined company is targeting production of 6 million to 7 million ounces of gold annually. In the three months ended March 31, gold production rose nearly 2 percent to 1.23 million ounces from a year earlier, while the average realized gold price fell by $26 to $1,300 per ounce. All-in sustaining costs fell to $907 per ounce from $943. Newmont shares were 0.1 percent lower at $32.18 in morning trading in New York on Thursday, compared with a 0.9 percent gain in the S&P/TSX Global Gold Index. Net income adjusted for costs related to the Goldcorp deal and the creation of a joint venture with Barrick Gold Corp fell to $176 million, or 33 cents per share, for the quarter, from $185 million, or 35 cents per share, in the same period last year. Total sales fell to $1.80 billion from $1.81 billion. Analysts’ on average had estimated profit of 27 cents per share on revenue of $1.83 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.

12.383116605792535," Newmont shareholders OK $10 billion Goldcorp takeover, creating biggest gold producer TORONTO (Reuters) - Newmont Mining shareholders on Thursday approved the company’s $10 billion takeover of Goldcorp Inc which is set to create the world’s biggest gold producer with assets across the Americas, Africa and Australia. About 98 percent of votes at a special meeting were in support of Newmont’s proposal to issue new stock to fund its takeover of Goldcorp, the Denver-based company said in a statement. Goldcorp’s investors voted to approve the acquisition last week. The deal, the biggest takeover in the gold sector’s history according to Refinitiv data, faced some initial opposition from Newmont investors who said it overly favored Goldcorp shareholders. But they rallied behind the proposal on the promise of a special dividend. The 88-cent-per-share special dividend will be paid on May 1 to those who hold Newmont shares as of April 17, according to the statement. Newmont shares were 0.7 percent lower at $36.01 in morning trading in New York, in line with the benchmark S&P/TSX Global Gold Index. Goldcorp shares slipped 0.26 percent to C$15.41 in Toronto. “We thank Newmont’s shareholders for their overwhelming support for this compelling value creation opportunity as we build the world’s leading gold company,” Newmont Chief Executive Gary Goldberg said in the statement. The new company, to be called Newmont Goldcorp, will overtake current market leader Barrick Gold Corp in annual production, churning out 6 million to 7 million ounces of gold annually over the next 10 years, compared with Barrick’s forecast of 5.1 million to 5.6 million ounces for 2019. Newmont Goldcorp expects to shed between $1 billion and $1.5 billion of assets to focus on its most promising operations. This, combined with mines Barrick plans to sell in the wake of its acquisition of Randgold Resources, is expected by analysts to fuel a flurry of deals in a sector that has been focused on cutting costs rather than pursuing growth for several years. Newmont’s acquisition of Goldcorp had faced several hurdles, beginning with Barrick’s hostile takeover bid for Newmont in February, which required it to abandon its deal with Goldcorp. That was resolved through the creation of a joint venture of Newmont and Barrick’s operations in Nevada, which was estimated to create $4.7 billion in synergies."

10.800944057405484," Valcambi loses deal to refine Newmont's gold: sources LONDON (Reuters) - Swiss gold refiner Valcambi has lost a contract to refine around 4 million ounces of gold a year from Newmont Mining Corp, one of the world’s biggest producers, five sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. U.S.-based Newmont put the contract up for tender last year and has split the business between three of Valcambi’s rivals - Asahi in the United States and Argor-Heraeus and PAMP in Switzerland, the sources said. “It all went up for tender and different refineries won different pieces (of the contract),” said one source. Valcambi, Argor-Heraeus, PAMP, Asahi and Newmont all declined to comment. Valcambi is the world’s largest gold refinery and had processed almost all of Newmont’s gold output for around 15 years, the sources said. Newmont owned a majority stake in Valcambi until 2015 when it sold the shares to India’s Rajesh Exports. The sources said Newmont would send gold from its mines in the United States to Asahi and material from mines in Peru and Ghana to either PAMP or Argor-Heraeus. Newmont also operates mines in Suriname and Australia, and in total produces around 5 million ounces, or 155 tonnes, of gold a year - more than 4 percent of global mine production and enough on its own to fill the capacity of a medium-sized refinery. Competition has pushed refining charges down sharply in recent years, and sources said rates for the Newmont deal could range from $0.30 an ounce to as little as $0.05 an ounce – translating to revenue of between $200,000 and $1.2 million a year for 4 million ounces. To boost revenues, refiners are increasingly making money out of products such as coins and jewelry parts for which they can charge more. Newmont is set to overtake Barrick Gold Corp as the world’s largest gold producer this year when it acquires rival Goldcorp Inc."

While some Goldcorp shareholders had voiced concerns in recent weeks, in the end there was little push back against blessing the biggest-ever corporate takeover in the gold sector’s history, according to Refinitiv data. The deal, which would create a company with assets in the Americas, Africa and Australia, will be voted on by Newmont shareholders next Thursday. If approved, the deal is expected to close by June. About 97 percent of Goldcorp’s outstanding shares that were voted at a special meeting were cast in favor of the deal, the company said in a statement. Newmont had offered 0.328 of its shares and 2 cents for each Goldcorp share. “We appreciate Goldcorp shareholders’ vote of confidence, which moves us one step closer to creating the world’s leading gold business,” Newmont Chief Executive Gary Goldberg said in a statement. Vancouver-based Goldcorp shares rose slightly on Thursday afternoon to C$15.39 in Toronto, and shares of Denver-based Newmont rose slightly to $36.02 in New York. The benchmark S&P/TSX Global Gold Index gained 0.8 percent. The new company, to be called Newmont Goldcorp, will overtake current market leader Barrick Gold Corp in annual production, churning out 6 million to 7 million ounces of gold annually over the next 10 years, compared with Barrick’s forecast of 5.1 million to 5.6 million ounces for 2019. The $1 billion to $1.5 billion of assets the combined company is expected to shed, combined with mines Barrick plans to sell in the wake of its acquisition of Randgold Resources earlier this year, is expected by analysts to fuel further sector deals. That is a change from the last several years, when miners focused on cutting costs instead and investors lost confidence in the industry after years of dilutive share issuances and pricey acquisitions. Thursday’s vote comes after a tense start to the year for the gold industry, sparked by Barrick’s hostile bid for Newmont two months ago, a proposal that would have required the Goldcorp deal be scrapped. While that was resolved through the creation of a joint venture of Barrick and Newmont’s Nevada assets, Newmont investors raised concerns about Goldcorp receiving too much of the benefits from the joint venture, which the company responded to with an 88-cent special dividend."
11.877269529480605," Newmont's special dividend wins top investors over to Goldcorp deal TORONTO (Reuters) - Newmont Mining Corp won the support of at least two key investors for its $10 billion takeover of Goldcorp Inc on Monday, after offering to sweeten the deal with an 88-cent-per-share special dividend if shareholders approve the transaction. The immediate cash payment would represent a portion of the savings from a separate agreement with Barrick Gold Corp, Newmont said in a regulatory statement. Newmont investors who had earlier protested the terms of the deal, saying Goldcorp shareholders benefited too much from it, commended the dividend payment and withdrew their opposition. “Although the dividend is small, it is a step in the right direction,” Paulson & Co, which last week said it would vote against the deal, wrote in an emailed statement. “Since the Newmont board and other significant shareholders are supportive of the revised terms, we will no longer oppose the transaction.” Newmont’s friendly bid to buy Goldcorp to create the world’s biggest gold producer preceded the agreement with rival Barrick to establish a joint venture combining their operations in Nevada. Newmont offered 0.328 of its shares and 2 cents for each Goldcorp share. Van Eck International Investors, which said last week that Newmont’s takeover offer transferred to Goldcorp shareholders too much of $4.7 billion in synergies from the Barrick venture, also expressed its support for the deal on Monday. “We’re very pleased with Newmont’s decision,” said Joe Foster, portfolio manager at Van Eck, Newmont’s third-biggest shareholder. “Companies always claim they’re going to create synergies. It’s great to see Newmont putting their money where their mouth is and giving us a payout up front.” In an investor presentation earlier this month, Newmont said Goldcorp shareholders would get $600 million of the pre-tax synergies from the joint venture with Barrick. “If one assumes this dividend payment of $469 million reflects the after-tax value of the JV that would have been previously shared with Goldcorp shareholders, it would appear to be fair,” Josh Wolfson, managing director of metals and mining at Desjardins Securities, said by email. Goldcorp shares jumped as much as 3.7 percent and closed up 2.7 percent at C$14.9 on Monday in Toronto, erasing most of Friday’s 2.9 percent loss. Newmont climbed 1.2 percent to $34.90, its highest close in a month in New York trading. “In the discussions I’ve had with a number of our large, long-term shareholders this morning, they’re quite pleased with this outcome and are supportive of it,” Newmont Chief Executive Gary Goldberg told Reuters on Monday. Goldcorp said in a separate statement it supported the special dividend. Also, Goldcorp said proxy advisory firm ISS recommended on Monday that its shareholders support Newmont’s takeover offer when they vote on April 4. Newmont shareholders will vote on April 11."

11.832090109215105," Top shareholders express concerns over parts of Newmont-Goldcorp deal TORONTO (Reuters) - British Columbia Investment Management Corp (BCI) and Van Eck International Investors on Friday joined a growing chorus of shareholders expressing concerns about elements of Newmont Mining’s $10 billion takeover of Goldcorp Inc. BCI said in a statement it will vote its Goldcorp shares against the deal, as it opposes the proposed $12 million retirement allowance the company intends to pay its Chairman Ian Telfer when the deal closes. VanEck is undecided on its vote but opposes the share of synergies from a recently announced joint venture between Newmont and Barrick Gold Corp that Goldcorp shareholders would receive, portfolio manager Joe Foster told Reuters. Newmont made a friendly offer in January for Goldcorp in what would be the gold sector’s biggest-ever takeover transaction, a bid to create the world’s largest gold producer. Barrick abandoned its own hostile bid for Newmont after Newmont agreed this month to combine its assets in Nevada with Barrick’s. Barrick’s takeover bid had included the caveat that the Newmont-Goldcorp deal not proceed. “BCI finds this decision (on Telfer’s compensation) to be fundamentally misaligned with the interests of shareholders who have experienced a significant destruction of almost 53 percent in value since 2006,” Daniel Garant, BCI’s senior vice president for public markets, wrote in the statement. BCI is analyzing the ballot for the Newmont vote and will disclose its proxy votes ahead of the shareholder meeting on April 11 on its website, a BCI spokeswoman said. Goldcorp’s shareholder vote will be on April 4. Foster too expressed concern about the payment to Telfer, saying it is not up to shareholders to fund executives’ “lavish lifestyles” and urged the company to scale back “outrageous payouts.” But “at the end of the day, I hope the deal goes through,” he said, adding he expects the companies will respond to the concerns. “Newmont is getting the Goldcorp assets at a good price, and Newmont’s management has the skills to create value from these assets.” The comments come on the heels of a letter from Paulson & Co. to Newmont on Thursday, saying it would vote against the company’s takeover of Goldcorp, as it transfers too much of the benefit of both the combination and the joint venture with Barrick to Goldcorp. Worries about the deal weighed on Goldcorp’s shares, which dropped as much as 4.8 percent and closed down 2.9 percent at C$14.51 in Toronto. Newmont shares, which earlier fell 2.2 percent, ended the day up 0.5 percent at $34.50 in New York, compared with the NYSE Arca Gold Miners index’s 0.1 percent gain."

The transaction is dilutive to Newmont shareholders and only Goldcorp shareholders would benefit from the deal’s synergies, Founder John Paulson and Partner Marcelo Kim said in the letter to Newmont Chief Executive Officer Gary Goldberg. Newmont made a friendly offer in January for Goldcorp in what would be the gold sector’s biggest-ever takeover transaction, a bid to create the world’s largest gold producer. Paulson & Co holds 14.2 million Newmont shares, according to the letter. That gives it 2.7 percent of the company, making it one of its biggest shareholders. Newmont spokesman Omar Jabara said the company had just received the letter and was evaluating it. The transaction would also transfer to Goldcorp investors a significant proportion of the value from Newmont’s recent joint venture with Barrick Gold Corp of their Nevada assets, Paulson said. “I think there is value-creation potential available for Newmont in buying Goldcorp at the current exchange ratio,” said Christopher Mancini, an analyst at Gabelli Gold Fund, which owns both Newmont and Goldcorp shares. “Voting down the Goldcorp deal from a Newmont shareholder perspective, just because they’d have to share some of the synergies in Nevada, would be like cutting off your nose to spite your face,” he added, declining to say how Gabelli will vote. Goldcorp shareholders are set to vote on the deal on April 4 and Newmont investors on April 11. Paulson said the firm would support a deal in which Goldcorp shareholders receive a maximum of 0.254 Newmont share rather than the 0.328 share they currently stand to get. “At this level, the transaction would generate value for Newmont shareholders while providing Goldcorp shareholders attractive consideration and an opportunity to participate in the shared upside of the combined company,” Paulson wrote. Newmont shares closed up 1.4 percent at $34.33 in New York while Goldcorp shares ended up 1.8 percent at C$14.94 in Toronto. “The benefit of the merger is in the long term; in the short-term there’s going to be a lot of teething pains,” said Robert Cohen, portfolio manager at 1832 Asset Management, which does not own shares in either company. “I wouldn’t be surprised if the deal does come off the rails.

7.435542881445922," Barrick Gold ends hostile Newmont bid, signs Nevada joint venture (Reuters) - Barrick Gold Corp on Monday pulled its $18 billion offer for Newmont Mining Corp and agreed to form a joint venture in Nevada with its rival, ending a hostile takeover bid that sought to unite the world’s two largest gold producers. By combining their operations in the southwestern U.S. state, which is home to one of the world’s largest gold-producing areas, Barrick and Newmont hope to save more than $5 billion over the next 20 years. Toronto-based Barrick will control 61.5 percent of the venture, giving it slightly less oversight than it initially wanted even as it gains full operational control over mines that produce more than 4 million ounces of gold annually. The agreement comes amid a pickup in deals across the gold industry, which has struggled with a loss of investor confidence and financing constraints in recent years. “This is one of those rare transactions that really does create demonstrable value for everyone involved,” Barrick Chief Executive Officer Mark Bristow told Reuters on Monday. “It shows that people, if you put your mind to it, can deliver transactions in a very short while.” Shares of Barrick were up about 0.9 percent at $13.05 on the New York Stock Exchange and up 1.1 percent at C$17.53 on the Toronto Stock Exchange in early afternoon trading. Newmont shares were down 2.3 percent to $32.92 in New York. Colorado-based Newmont rejected Barrick’s all-stock zero-premium hostile takeover, which was launched last month, and proposed instead the Nevada joint venture, which both companies have tried to form for years. The deal seems to wash away, for now, vestiges of a long-simmering feud between the companies. Bristow, on the same day Barrick launched its bid, called Newmont CEO Gary Goldberg a “loser” in a Reuters interview. Goldberg, for his part, had told Reuters that Bristow’s “credibility and experience” and performance at Randgold, which Bristow had led until two months ago when it was acquired by Barrick, was “anemic.” Yet both men flew to Nevada on Monday to announce the deal, a step designed to underscore collaboration. Even the companies’ social media accounts played nice: Barrick’s Twitter profile “liked” Newmont’s announcement of the Nevada JV. As part of Monday’s agreement, Barrick will also withdraw several shareholder proposals for Newmont’s annual meeting later this year. “Through this joint venture, the whole is going to be worth a lot more than the sum of its parts,” said Newmont Chief Operating Officer Tom Palmer, who will take over as CEO when Goldberg retires at the end of 2019. Newmont and Barrick share many investors, and some had been unenthusiastic about the hostile takeover bid. The VanEck International Investors Gold Fund, the largest Barrick shareholder and one of the top three in Newmont, urged the companies last week to focus on the Nevada venture and expressed skepticism about a full takeover of Newmont. Newmont can now move forward on its own planned takeover of Canada’s Goldcorp Inc, a deal that will help it leapfrog Barrick to become the world’s largest gold producer. Barrick and Newmont had discussed a 50-50 joint venture in Nevada late last year but could not agree on who would control it, according to sources familiar with the matter. Newmont then turned its attention to the Goldcorp deal, and in the eyes of Barrick executives, put off the Nevada talks for months, sources said. Barrick’s hostile offer brought Newmont executives back to the table. The joint venture Newmont proposed early this month, in which it would control 45 percent and Barrick 55 percent, was a starting point for renewed talks that were serious for the first time in decades. Bristow responded in press interviews that he wanted closer to 66 percent control. Now focused on the joint venture, Goldberg and Bristow met in New York last Tuesday, and again in Toronto two days later, sources said. The companies’ boards agreed to the deal over the weekend, and both management teams traveled to Elko, Nevada, for Monday’s announcement. The deal will lead to cuts at the oversight level but not in operations, although the number of reductions is yet to be determined, Bristow said."

3.30229109959306," Top Barrick shareholder urges joint venture in Nevada with Newmont (Reuters) - Barrick Gold Corp’s top shareholder said on Tuesday the miner should focus on striking a joint venture deal in Nevada with rival Newmont Mining Corp before considering a full-blown merger. “My preference is a joint venture,” Joe Foster of the Van Eck International Investors Gold Fund, said in a phone interview. “I don’t flat out oppose a merger. If a merger is the only way to unify Nevada then maybe, just maybe, that’s something we might consider. But as it stands the best path right now is to form a JV in Nevada.” Barrick launched an $18 billion takeover offer for Newmont last month, which Newmont rejected. Both sides have said they agree their neighboring Nevada assets should be combined to cut costs, but they disagree on how this should be done. Newmont said it prefers a joint venture in the state, a plan Barrick says would be too complicated and not financially beneficial to all shareholders. A Nevada joint venture “would avoid exposing our investors to the complexity and significant risk that would come with combining the two companies,” Newmont spokesman Omar Jabara said on Tuesday in response to Foster’s comments. Barrick did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Barrick Chief Executive Mark Bristow told Reuters on Monday he was ready to seriously negotiate a Nevada joint venture. Bristow and Newmont CEO Gary Goldberg were meeting Tuesday in New York to discuss Newmont’s proposal for the joint venture, which was unveiled earlier this week, according to sources familiar with the matter. Van Eck owns about 110 million shares of Barrick, or about 6.4 percent of the company, making it the largest shareholder. The fund is also owns about 7 percent of Newmont, making it the third-largest shareholder, with roughly 31 million shares. Foster said he recognized that Bristow and Goldberg were “miles apart on a JV agreement,” but urged them to hash out a deal. “These companies pay these guys a lot of money. They need to find a place in the middle where they can come together and create value for shareholders,” Foster said. If there is no other way to combine the Nevada properties, a merger is “one way to create that value.” But Foster said a merger would create a “monstrous” gold company. “Creating a JV seems a lot simpler than mashing these two huge companies together,” Foster said."

2.6423514726977926," Barrick says open to Nevada joint venture talks with Newmont (Reuters) - Barrick Gold Corp Chief Executive Mark Bristow said on Monday he wants to speak immediately with Newmont Mining Corp about a proposed Nevada joint venture, even as his company moves to take a $18 billion takeover offer directly to Newmont shareholders. Newmont earlier on Monday rejected Barrick’s full buyout offer and reiterated its plans to go ahead with its deal to buy smaller rival Goldcorp Inc. Newmont’s JV proposal, unveiled Monday, seeks to combine adjacent mines and other facilities in Nevada. While the logic of integrating operations seems clear to both Barrick and Newmont, the sticking point has been control. “We will definitely engage Newmont immediately to see if they have a genuine commitment to this discussion around unlocking the synergies of Nevada,” Bristow told Reuters. Asked for comment, Newmont spokesman Omar Jabara said in an emailed statement that his company “looks forward to hearing back from Barrick on our letter (rejecting Barrick’s offer) and joint venture proposal.” Neither side seems to agree on the full value of the Nevada assets. Newmont’s JV proposal uses publicly available materials to estimate value, as neither side has sat down to formally hash out how a JV could work. In a Reuters interview, Bristow said that based on the consensus estimates for Barrick’s assets in Nevada, his company should control at least 66 percent of any joint venture, compared to the 55 percent Newmont proposed. Newmont’s JV proposal includes some assets in Colorado, which does not border Nevada. The proposed Barrick deal for Newmont would combine two of the biggest gold producers in the world at a time when both companies are trying to bolster shrinking gold reserves to boost growth as well as take advantage of rising prices. Bristow said that Barrick will likely go to Newmont shareholders with a formal offer ahead of the upcoming Newmont shareholder vote planned this spring on the Goldcorp buyout. A date for the vote has not yet been set. “Shareholders will at least have an alternative to consider to the proposed Newmont-Goldcorp transaction,” Bristow said. “We need to make a formal alternative to the current agreement that’s in place.” Newmont said earlier on Monday that its Canadian rival’s all-stock offer was not in the best interest of its shareholders as it was offered at a discount. “Barrick’s egocentric proposal is designed to transfer value from Newmont’s shareholders to Barrick,” Newmont’s chief executive, Gary Goldberg, said on an investor call. Barrick’s offer of 2.5694 common shares for each Newmont share was equivalent to about $33 per share, which represented a discount of $3.48 to Newmont’s closing price on Feb. 22, the last trading day before the offer was announced. Newmont shares have fallen about 6 percent since Barrick’s offer. Bristow said in the interview that Newmont’s Australian assets likely would be sold to an Australian company should he prevail in his buyout and that he has already talked with several Australian miners. Several media reports in recent weeks indicated that Newcrest Mining Ltd would be interested. “We have absolute reason to believe that there’s an interest from some of the bigger Australian mining companies in acquiring the Newmont Australian assets,” Bristow said. Shares of Barrick rose 1.7 percent to close Monday at C$16.62 in Toronto trading. Shares of Newmont rose 1.9 percent on Monday to close at $34.45 in New York."

Mudslinging started almost as soon as the hostile all-stock, no-premium bid was announced on Monday. One rival executive compared the tension between Barrick Chief Executive Mark Bristow and Newmont CEO Gary Goldberg to the Hatfields and McCoys, two 19th Century U.S. families whose members held a grudge for generations. “Newmont shareholders shouldn’t risk what they have and need for what they don’t have and don’t need,” Goldberg told Reuters on Friday. Newmont’s board continues to evaluate Barrick’s offer, Goldberg said. He reiterated what he had said earlier in the week that all options were on the table, including a Newmont bid for Barrick. Bristow was not available for an interview on Friday. At the heart of the debate is Nevada, where Barrick and Newmont have owned neighboring mines since the 1980s. Newmont said it prefers a joint venture in the state, a plan which Barrick says would be too complicated and not financially beneficial to all shareholders. The logic of combining the company’s Nevada assets seems clear to both sides, but the sticking point is control. “If those fences and armed guards were removed, you’d have trucks from Barrick’s mine not drive hours to get to the crusher and roaster, but they would have to go two miles to Newmont’s,” said an person familiar with Barrick’s thinking. Bristow and Goldberg were emailing each other as recently as late January about a potential Nevada venture before Bristow stopped responding, Goldberg said. “I was hopeful that Mark, as another miner, would be able to sit down and do a (Nevada joint venture) deal as a point of logic,” said Goldberg. “But then he dropped a hostile, no-premium bid.” Bristow, for his part, said in an interview earlier this week that Goldberg did not show up for recently planned meetings to discuss Nevada. ‘FIGHT TO THE DEATH’ Barrick, which two months ago closed a $6.1 billion buyout of Randgold Resources, has encouraged Newmont to ditch a previously announced $10 billion takeover of Canada’s Goldcorp Inc. Barrick has historically relied on acquisitions for growth, amassing billions of dollars of debt that it has been working to pay down. Newmont in recent years has focused on organic growth and financial discipline, although the Goldcorp bid breaks with past practice. Those divergent strategies would be hard to meld even in a friendly proposal, but become that much more difficult amid the culture clash, according to multiple investors and bankers, with the acrimony threatening to scuttle the deal as it did when the companies last tried to combine in 2014. “Newmont will fight to the death to stay independent,” a banking source said. Newmont’s shares have gained 39 percent in the past five years, compared to a 26 percent drop for Barrick’s stock and a 3 percent drop in gold prices. Some Newmont shareholders question Barrick’s claim that the deal will generate more than $7 billion in synergies. “We have no reason to have confidence in (Bristow’s) ability to manage such a vastly more-complicated company,” said James Rasteh of Coast Capital Management LP, which said it holds more than 100,000 Newmont shares. Bristow said in an interview earlier this week that his record at Africa-focused Randgold speaks for itself. Some investors agree. “Newmont is a company in need of a shakeup,” said John Ing of Maison Placements, which declined to say how many Barrick shares it holds. BlackRock, a top-three investor in both companies, declined to comment. Flossbach Von Storch, a large investor in both companies, has said it supports a friendly deal but could not be reached for comment on Friday. Newmont would have to pay Goldcorp a $650 million break-up fee if it pulls its offer. Ironically, that would be the only cash that would change hands were the Barrick-Newmont deal to move forward, irking some Newmont shareholders.

-6.746816928513917," 'Loser' vs 'Anemic': Barrick's Newmont bid starts on toxic note HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (Reuters) - Long-time rivals Barrick Gold Corp and Newmont Mining Corp renewed their animosity on Monday with their chief executives trading insults after Barrick launched an $18 billion hostile bid for the U.S. company, presaging an aggressive battle. The tough talk underscored deep personality and cultural differences between the world’s two biggest gold producers. Their past attempts to merge ended in acrimony in 2014, and the frictions could scuttle a deal this time too. Newmont’s financial returns in recent years show its CEO, Gary Goldberg, is a “loser,” Barrick CEO Mark Bristow told Reuters. Goldberg, for his part, told Reuters that Bristow’s “credibility and experience” and performance at Randgold, which he led until last month when it was acquired by Barrick, was “anemic.” Adding to the residue of resentment at the mining companies from past merger failures, the current hostile climate between the companies reflects animosity between the CEOs, opposing management styles and clashing visions for how to achieve maximum shareholder value. The animus between Bristow and Goldberg extended to a dispute over who extended his hand first for a handshake at a BMO Metals & Mining Conference in Florida on Monday. For investors, a Barrick-Newmont merger would bring under one roof some of the world’s most compatible gold mines and plants, which sit side by side in Nevada, and create a company likely to appeal to top shareholders seeking a haven for long-only money. Barrick said there is more logic in a tie-up between the two than in Newmont’s planned $10 billion merger with Goldcorp. “I think in an environment of lower gold prices, everyone needs more synergies and the synergies of Nevada - Barrick and Newmont - should have been done a long time ago,” said Greg Taylor of Purpose Investments, which holds Newmont shares. Newmont rejected the Barrick bid, saying a joint venture was a better way to extract value from the two companies’ mines in Nevada. The two CEOs said they have not met to compare financial records on the other’s Nevada assets. Each blamed the other for not being willing to share information. “I drive trucks past ... processing plants in Nevada, because Gary won’t share with me,” Bristow said. Goldberg questioned when he was in the state “given that Bristow’s not really spent much time in Nevada to begin with.” The Newmont CEO was adamant the Goldcorp deal was best for his company, contrasting it with what he described as Bristow’s short-sighted reliance on cost-cutting to pump profits. “We see great value,” he said. “It feels to us that wherever Mark (Bristow) goes, he seems to be just firing people in order to boost returns.” David Neuhauser of Livermore Partners, which holds Barrick shares, said the no-premium bid could “over time suggest a premium multiple, given the long life and cash-generating abilities” of the combined assets. Van Eck and BlackRock, two large shareholders in both names, did not respond to requests for comment. Major investors have taken on extra weight in the gold sector since many of the smaller metals funds disappeared after the 2015 to 2016 commodity slump. Those long-only funds, which do not invest in small companies, have largely driven the need for gold consolidation. “Passive investors will seal the fate of this deal,” said Brian Madden of Goodreid in Toronto. The bid now goes to shareholders, with Barrick asking Newmont’s investors to approve bylaw changes that would ultimately make its hostile bid easier. The big loser would be Goldcorp, only just enjoying a share rally on the prospect of a tie-up with Newmont, which could be left without any potential buyers. Goldcorp’s best hope is that it gets swept up in the next wave of activity, which many investors and analysts predict as a mighty Barrick sheds some of its assets. “There is nothing Goldcorp can do to avoid the collapse of their deal,” a banker who worked on the Randgold-Barrick deal said on condition of anonymity. “Newmont and Barrick is the deal that should have always happened, at least for the past 20 years.”"
-9.004805099902136," Barrick CEO defends $18 billion hostile Newmont bid as logical tie-up HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (Reuters) - Barrick Gold Corp’s chief executive defended the world’s largest gold producer’s hostile $18 billion bid for Newmont Mining Corp, saying on Monday the deal is “logical” for an industry battling high costs and depleting resources. Barrick, which recently completed a $6.1 billion acquisition of Africa-focused Randgold Resources, launched its all-stock bid on Monday, encouraging the U.S. rival to ditch a previously announced $10 billion takeover of Canada’s Goldcorp Inc. “This gold industry needs to become more relevant to investors,” CEO Mark Bristow said in an interview on the sidelines of the BMO Global Metals & Mining Conference in Hollywood, Florida. Bristow, known for his straight-talking and hands-on approach in running Randgold before the merger, said this deal “drives a further rationalization in our industry.” Gold mergers and acquisitions have been scarce in recent years as companies focused on cutting costs in the face of investor criticism about capital management. But the need to bolster shrinking gold reserves to boost growth and take advantage of rising prices are providing the impetus for consolidation. Barrick’s offer for Newmont has pushed the combined value of unsolicited M&A deals globally to $48.2 billion so far this year, the highest since 2006, according to data from Refinitiv. Newmont said it had reviewed and rejected possible deals with Barrick and said its own $10 billion planned purchase of Goldcorp made more business sense. “One has to question what the true motives behind going hostile are: Whether it’s really just to get bigger or it’s all ego-driven,” Newmont CEO Gary Goldberg told Reuters at the BMO conference, adding Newmont shareholders “don’t understand it (and) don’t see the value potential.” Barrick said its acquisition of Newmont was contingent on the company scrapping the deal to buy Toronto-listed Goldcorp, adding that its offer was a “significantly superior” option for Newmont shareholders. Goldberg said earlier on Monday a joint venture was a better way to extract value from the two companies’ mines in Nevada, the largest producer of gold and silver among U.S. states. Newmont has 19 mines in the state, adjacent to Barrick's own operations. Reuters had reported here in November that the miners were in talks to combine their operations in the state. Talks of a joint venture fell through over Newmont’s demand for management control, Barrick’s Bristow said on a conference call with analysts. The deal marks Bristow’s first major strategic move at Barrick since taking the top position in January. Newmont’s board of directors would “fully evaluate the Barrick proposal and respond in due course,” the company said. Gold sector deals took off when Barrick paid $6.1 billion for rival Randgold, a deal that closed last month. That set off a fresh wave of bids, including Newmont’s offer for smaller miner Goldcorp, which would make the Colorado-based firm the world’s top gold miner if it closes as planned next quarter. Shares of Newmont fell 0.7 percent to $36.22 at mid-afternoon, while Barrick’s Toronto shares dropped 2.7 percent. Barrick is offering 2.5694 of its common shares for each Newmont share. That translates to about $33 per Newmont share, valuing the company at $17.85 billion, according to Reuters calculations. The deals come as gold prices are rising, with gains of some 11 percent since October. Newmont shareholders would hold about 44 percent of the combined company’s outstanding shares. Barrick said the new company would match Newmont’s annual dividend of 56 cents per share which, based on the offer, would represent a pro-forma annual dividend of 22 cents per Barrick share."

While Bristow moved fast to reorganize Barrick since taking the helm last month, Newmont CEO Gary Goldberg has said he will retire at the end of 2019 after, he hopes, the Goldcorp deal closes. Goldberg’s departure has not gone unnoticed by Bristow, who has fashioned it into his own pitch to shareholders. “By the way: Newmont’s management’s leaving and we’re not,” Bristow said. Investors across the industry are “definitely not pleased” with Newmont’s Goldcorp bid and view it as a kind of “value destruction,” Bristow said. “We’re pointing out that this current (Newmont-Goldcorp) proposal takes away the opportunity for both sets of shareholders to participate in one of the few logical M&A transactions available to the industry,” said Bristow. “The (Newmont) merger with Goldcorp adds no Tier One assets to their portfolio,” he said. Bristow said he has talked to his shareholders and those at Newmont in “general” terms about his hostile bid, but not specifically. He said he has no concerns about ultimately receiving their approval. Newmont has suggested that instead of an outright sale, the two companies could combine Nevada operations in a joint venture. Newmont has 19 mines in the state, adjacent to Barrick’s own operations. Bristow rejected the idea, saying it would not bring the same cost savings as combining the two companies. “You won’t unlock the full value in a JV,” he said. “We genuinely feel that we have the capacity to unlock this value once and for all.”"

Bristow said he has talked to his shareholders and those at Newmont in “general” terms about his hostile bid, but not specifically. He said he has no concerns about ultimately receiving their approval. Newmont has suggested that instead of an outright sale, the two companies could combine Nevada operations in a joint venture. Newmont has 19 mines in the state, adjacent to Barrick’s own operations. Bristow rejected the idea, saying it would not bring the same cost savings as combining the two companies. “You won’t unlock the full value in a JV,” he said. “We genuinely feel that we have the capacity to unlock this value once and for all.” (Reporting by Ernest Scheyder; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)"

Newmont said it received notice of intent from a unit of Barrick for two shareholder proposals for consideration at Newmont’s next annual meeting of stockholders. The proposals would be to lower the ownership threshold necessary to call shareholder meetings to 15 percent from the current 25 percent, and to repeal all bylaw amendments implemented since Oct. 24, Newmont said in a statement. If successful, the proposals would make it easier for shareholders to call a vote to oust Newmont’s board, and come as further sign that Barrick could be moving ahead with preparations for a hostile bid for Newmont.

-11.645288365669316," Canada's Barrick considers buyout of rival Newmont Mining MELBOURNE/HOUSTON (Reuters) - Canada’s Barrick Gold Corp said on Friday it considered making an all-stock bid for U.S. rival Newmont Mining Corp, a deal that would create a monolith in the global gold sector and likely push smaller peers to start buying each other. Barrick, already the world’s largest gold miner, said its contemplated proposal did not offer any premium to Newmont’s shareholders and that no decision had been taken so far. Newmont said on Friday it was aware of Barrick’s statement but would not comment on its rival’s interest or motivation. Newmont’s shares closed Friday up 3 percent at $36.48 in New York trading. Barrick fell 2.4 percent to C$17.13 on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Deal-making had largely been dormant in the gold sector in recent years, as companies focused on cutting costs amid investor criticism of inadequate management of capital. But Barrick’s $6.1 billion buyout of rival Randgold Resources last month set off a fresh wave of deals, with Newmont following soon thereafter with a $10 billion offer to buy smaller rival Goldcorp Inc. That combination would make Newmont the world’s top gold miner if it closes as planned next quarter. While Barrick said it has not considered a premium offer for Newmont shareholders, its argument for the deal would be that it would create an unrivaled gold miner with lower costs than either company has now, according to a source familiar with Barrick’s thinking. Barrick’s acknowledgement of interest in Newmont came the day after Canadian newspaper Globe and Mail reported that Barrick was considering a $19 billion hostile bid. The paper, which also reported that Barrick would flip some of Newmont’s assets to Australia’s Newcrest Mining, cited industry sources familiar with the situation. Under the potential terms reported by the paper, Barrick would keep Newmont’s Nevada and African mines, while Newcrest was considering taking over its Australian operations. The timing of the news comes ahead of next week’s BMO Capital Markets Global Metals & Mining Conference, a key meeting for industry investors and executives. The potential deal is likely to be the main topic at the conference, with Newmont shareholders talking to the company’s management about Barrick rather than Goldcorp, according to a mining industry source. Newmont does not plan to take any defensive action now as there is no formal offer, though Barrick’s assertion that there would be no premium was met coolly at Newmont’s Denver headquarters, according to a source close to Newmont. It was not immediately clear if such a deal would even face major regulatory scrutiny, as much of the world’s gold is already in circulation and gold miners themselves produce only a small percentage of the yellow metal available for trade. One of Newmont’s main areas of operations is Nevada, the largest U.S. producer of gold and silver. Newmont’s 19 mines in the state abut Barrick’s own operations, making any combination enticing. This is not the first time the pair have mulled a marriage. In 2014, a proposed tie-up collapsed after months of negotiations due in part to acrimony between management. But Barrick has formed new management teams and cut administrative costs as part of new Chief Executive Mark Bristow’s plan to set the combined company firmly apart from peers. Bristow had said on a post-earnings call earlier this month that Barrick Gold would continue to look at opportunities for mergers or acquisitions, though he stressed that he felt the company had plenty of internal growth opportunities. “There’s a danger that Barrick is biting off more than it can chew (by making another large acquisition),” said an Australia-based banker, declining to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue. If Barrick were to be successful, the merger between Newmont and Goldcorp would not go ahead, and Barrick would be liable for a $650 million break fee, the newspaper reported. A Newcrest spokesperson said the firm did not comment on M&A speculation. Goldcorp was not immediately available for comment. Newmont has three gold mines in Australia, which have a net present value of $4.5 billion according to AME Group, but none of those are seen as the kind of large ‘tier one’ developments that Newcrest has said are a prerequisite for any major buys. “Newcrest has a production hole in a couple of years’ time with Cadia going offline,” said one fund source based in Melbourne, referring to one of Australia’s largest gold mines. “It makes sense that they would be looking, but I would question the ‘tier one’ nature of the asset.” Any deal for the assets would hinge on price and the manner of payment, two other bankers and a fund manager said. “I wouldn’t care if they are not ‘tier one’ assets,” said Simon Mawhinney of Allan Gray in Melbourne, which is the top shareholder in Newcrest with a stake of around 9 percent. “But I would care if they were overpaid for, that would be a big issue.”"

-8.917311993016856," UPDATE 1-Newmont Mining profit beats on higher gold output, lower costs (Compares with estimates, adds industry background, costs and production) Feb 21 (Reuters) - U.S. gold miner Newmont Mining Corp beat analysts’ estimates for quarterly profit on Thursday, boosted by higher gold production in its Colorado and Ghana mines and lower costs. The company is set to overtake Barrick Gold Corp as the world’s largest gold producer following its acquisition of rival Goldcorp Inc, which is expected to close in the second quarter. Newmont’s gold production rose nearly 8 percent to 1.44 million ounces in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, while its all-in sustaining costs to produce an ounce of gold fell to $835 from $910. This helped cushion the impact of a 3 percent drop in average realized gold prices to $1,233 per ounce. Newmont, which operates mines in the Americas, Africa and Australia, said copper production was largely flat at 11,000 tonnes. The company's net income attributable to shareholders was $2 million in the fourth quarter (reut.rs/2TVuMea) ended Dec. 31, compared with a loss of $542 million a year earlier.

14.277457832259232," Newmont takes top gold producer spot with $10 billion Goldcorp buy (Reuters) - Newmont Mining Corp said on Monday it would buy smaller rival Goldcorp Inc for $10 billion, creating the world’s biggest gold producer in the face of dwindling easy-to-find reserves of the precious metal. The transaction, the biggest ever takeover in the gold sector according to Refinitiv, follows Barrick Gold Corp’s agreement in September to buy Randgold Resources Ltd in a deal valued at $6.1 billion. “Combining forces will give us the sector’s best project pipeline and exploration portfolio,” Newmont Chief Executive Gary Goldberg said on a conference call with analysts. “These prospects translate to the gold sector’s largest reserve and resource base.” Vancouver-based Goldcorp’s Toronto-listed shares rose 7 percent to C$13.75 at 12:03 p.m. ET (1703 GMT). Newmont Mining’s shares were down about 8.8 percent at $31.83 in New York. In recent years, investor criticism over inadequate management of capital had largely kept gold companies focused on costs while dampening enthusiasm for acquisitions. But the need to bolster shrinking reserves and production and a rising gold price are now serving as catalysts for increased dealmaking. Spot gold prices are up 11.3 percent since an August trough, when they had declined 15 percent from a January 2018 peak. Newmont’s acquisition of Goldcorp could spark further consolidation in the industry, where too many gold companies are chasing too few assets, Michael Siperco from Macquarie Research said. He did not specify which companies are most likely to follow suit. The new company, to be called Newmont Goldcorp, is set to overtake current leader Barrick Gold’s annual production and will have mines in the Americas, Australia and Ghana. “This transaction is positive for Newmont, because it establishes it as the world’s leading gold producer with a deal that is accretive on nearly all key metrics,” analysts at Scotiabank wrote in a note. The new company will be led by Newmont’s Goldberg. He will retire at the end of 2019, when Tom Palmer, Newmont’s chief operating officer, will take over as the CEO, the companies said. Denver, Colorado-based Newmont expects savings of $100 million a year. The combined company will sell $1 billion to $1.5 billion worth of assets over the next two years as part of the deal, mirroring a similar move by Barrick when it announced the Rangold acquisition. The new company is expected to produce 6-7 million ounces of gold annually over the next 10 years and beyond versus Barrick’s 2018 forecast of between 4.5 million and 5 million ounces. Newmont will offer 0.3280 of its share and $0.02 for each Goldcorp share. Based on Newmont’s Friday close, that translates to $11.46 per share, a premium of about 18 percent to Goldcorp’s Friday close on the New York Stock Exchange. nBw4JX5tpa] That remains below premiums paid in the last decade for gold deals, Credit Suisse analysts said in a note. The transaction is scheduled to close in the second quarter, the companies said.

1.8831369935049505," Newmont says 2019 gold production at mid-point of previous outlook (Reuters) - Newmont Mining Corp on Thursday updated its five-year production outlook and said it expects gold production for 2019 to be in the midpoint of its previous forecast. The Colorado-based miner sees 2019 output at 5.2 million ounces of gold, from an earlier forecast range of 4.9 million ounces to 5.4 million ounces. The company expects production in 2019 to be driven by its recently completed Subika Underground project in Ghana. The project received an environmental permit to build and operate in March 2017. The gold miner said its 2019 North America production will be hurt by depletion of Silverstar ore at Carlin mine and lower gold production at Phoenix mine in Nevada. North America production is estimated to be 37 percent of total production in the next year, the company said. Newmont’s all-in sustaining cost (AISC) of producing an ounce of gold in 2019, a closely-watched industry benchmark, is now projected at $935, compared with an earlier estimated range of $870 to $970 per ounce. Analysts at RBC Dominion Securities said the five-year production outlook is modestly lower than expected, but the AISC was in-line with estimates. Newmont reported lower third-quarter profit and revenue in October compared to year-ago period, hurt by a drop in bullion and copper prices. Spot gold fell about 9 percent from a peak in April when gold was trading at around $1,365 per ounce as the U.S.-China trade conflict unfolded against a backdrop of higher U.S. interest rates, denting gold’s appeal.

5.7794212914947085," Barrick in talks with Newmont to combine Nevada gold operations: sources LONDON (Reuters) - Barrick Gold Corp, which is being formed by Barrick's ABX.TO $6.1 billion takeover of Randgold Resources RRS.L, is in talks with Newmont Mining NEM.N to combine their Nevada gold mining operations, sources told Reuters. Last month’s tie-up between Barrick and Africa-focused Randgold Resources revived speculation about a joint venture between Newmont and Barrick in Nevada, something the two mining firms had explored in 2014 without reaching a deal. “They have been trying to negotiate for years but Newmont couldn’t agree with Barrick, now that you have a new management team, it’s certain they revived those talks,” one source said. Newmont produced 1.8 million ounces of gold in Nevada in 2017 and has processing capacity which would benefit Barrick Nevada, which produced 2.3 million ounces or 43 percent of its owner’s 2017 output in 2017. This included a joint venture at Turquoise Ridge mine, which is 25 percent owned by Newmont and annual savings from a combination of Newmont and Barrick’s Nevada assets could reach up to $300 million, according to analysts estimates. “They are looking to turn Nevada into a free cash flow machine and this is the easiest way to do it,” one source said. Barrick, Randgold and Newmont declined to comment. Both Randgold and Barrick are focused on closing the deal after shareholder votes this week and will begin consolidating the combined business, including the sale of assets. Barrick is likely to hold on to its copper mines after the Randgold takeover, even as it embarks on disposing of non-core assets, one of the sources added, betting on the metal used in construction, renewable energy and electric vehicles. In October, Barrick’s Executive Chairman John Thornton said the miner was in “slow-motion, long-term conversations” with partners in Saudi Arabia and China interested in its copper assets, which collectively produced 413,000 tonnes and about 7 percent of revenue in 2017."
12.493123452141706," Newmont profit dips alongside gold, copper prices TORONTO (Reuters) - Colorado-based Newmont Mining Corp NEM.N reported lower third-quarter profit and revenue on Thursday, as a drop in bullion and copper prices hurt the gold miner's results. Newmont had been jockeying for the title of world's largest gold producer this year, until Barrick Gold ABX.TO announced its $6.1 billion deal to buy Randgold Resources RRS.L in September. Newmont would rather focus on improving margins for existing production than pursuing mergers and acquisitions for growth, Chief Executive Gary Goldberg said last month at an annual gold industry gathering in Denver. In the quarter ended Sept. 30, Newmont earned adjusted profit of $175 million, or 33 cents per share, compared with $184 million, or 34 cents a share, a year earlier. That beat the 19 cent per share adjusted profit that analysts, on average, had expected, according to Refinitiv data. “Newmont delivered $636 million in adjusted EBITDA and $154 million in free cash flow in the third quarter on the back of ongoing productivity improvements across the portfolio and higher grades in Africa and South America,” Goldberg said in a statement. On a net basis, Newmont reported a loss of $161 million, or 31 cents a share, compared to a year-earlier profit of $213 million, or 39 cents a share. The loss includes impairment charges of $366 million. A $331 million charge reflected Newmont’s decision to not advance certain exploration projects, while a $35 million charge stems from a new mine plan at its Emigrant open pit operation in Nevada, which shortened its mine life. The miner narrowed its 2018 gold production forecast to between 4.9 million and 5.2 million ounces, from 4.9-5.4 million previously. It improved its production cost estimate to between $950 and $990 per ounce on an all-in sustaining basis, a closely watched industry benchmark meant to more fully capture costs, from $965 to $1,025 an ounce. Newmont reaffirmed its full-year forecasts for total and sustaining capital and copper production. Gold production declined 4 percent to 1.29 million ounces in the quarter, while the average realized gold price dropped by $75 to $1,201 per ounce.

-20.27923785919373," Newmont buys stake in Canadian gold project, beats second-quarter profit view (Reuters) - Newmont Mining Corp NEM.N, which topped Wall Street estimates for quarterly profit, said on Thursday it would acquire a 50 percent stake in a gold project in Western Canada as miners look for new reserves. Major gold miners are racing to explore, expand and construct new mines as years of belt tightening have left them with diminishing reserves at their existing mines. Newmont would pay $275 million to Novagold Resources Inc NG.TO for its stake in the Galore Creek project. The remaining stake is held by Teck Resources Ltd TECKb.TO. “Galore Creek holds the potential to support decades of profitable copper and gold production in a favorable mining jurisdiction,” Newmont Chief Executive Gary Goldberg said in a statement. According to Teck Resources, an estimated 8 million ounces of gold and 9 billion pounds of copper could be mined at the project. Newmont said that while total gold production in the second quarter fell 14 percent to 1.16 million ounces, realized gold prices rose 3.3 percent to $1,292 per ounce. However, the company reaffirmed its full-year production forecast of between 4.9 million and 5.4 million ounces, which would see it overtake Canadian rival Barrick Gold Corp ABX.TO as the world's largest gold producer. Net income attributable to shareholders rose to $292 million, or 54 cents a share, in the quarter ended June 30 from $175 million, or 33 cents per share, a year earlier. Total sales fell to $1.66 billion from $1.88 billion. Excluding one-time items, the company earned 26 cents per share, while analysts on average had expected 24 cents a share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S."

-6.922217487910373," Newmont profit beats estimates on higher gold prices (Reuters) - U.S. Gold miner Newmont Mining Corp NEM.N reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday as gold prices got a boost from investors turning to safe haven assets due to recent geopolitical tensions. Gold hit $1,366 in January, its highest in 1-1/2 years, lifting Newmont’s average realized prices of the commodity by 8.8 percent to $1,326 per ounce. That resulted in a 7.5 percent increase in total sales to $1.82 billion, helping offset a slight dip in production. Newmont, which has mines in the Americas, Africa and Australia, said total gold production fell 2 percent to 1.21 million ounces. Still, volumes were higher than rival Barrick Gold Corp's ABX.TO first-quarter production of 1.05 million ounces. Newmont also stuck to its 2018 forecast of 4.9-5.4 million ounces of gold output, putting it on track to overtake Barrick Gold as the world’s largest producer this year. Net income attributable to shareholders of Newmont rose to $192 million, or 36 cents per share, for the quarter ended March 31 from $47 million, or 9 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the Greenwood Village, Colorado-based company reported a profit of 35 cents per share, missing the average analyst estimate of 33 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S."
