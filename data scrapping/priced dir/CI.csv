Circuit Judge Richard Sullivan, writing for a unanimous panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Wednesday, found that a district judge wrongly applied a Connecticut statute of limitations in dismissing Cigna’s case against six testing companies owned by Rennova Health Inc as time-barred.

26.889137210196946," Cigna forecasts higher medical costs in 2021 after profit miss (Reuters) - Health insurer Cigna Corp on Thursday reported lower-than-expected quarterly profit and said it expects higher medical costs in 2021 from COVID-19 treatment as well as normalizing demand for discretionary healthcare services. Cigna’s shares were down about 2%, after the company forecast a negative impact of about $1.25 per share mainly due to COVID-19 costs in 2021. Also contributing to the hit will be a decline in customer volumes in its unit that sells employer-sponsored and government health plans, due to the economic impact of the pandemic, Chief Financial Officer Brian Evanko said. While health insurers largely benefited from a slump in patient use of discretionary healthcare services last year, costs related to their programs to support customers with COVID-19 testing and treatment have largely offset the gains. Cigna said it expects the trend to continue in the first quarter. For the fourth quarter, Cigna’s medical care ratio - the amount spent on medical claims versus the income from premiums - worsened to 85.8% from 82.3%, owing to COVID-19 testing and treatment costs. The company said it expects the ratio to be in the range of 81% to 82% in 2021. Larger rival UnitedHealth last month said it expected COVID-19-related cost trends in 2021 to remain similar to 2020, despite the ongoing vaccination efforts. Cigna said it sees full-year consolidated adjusted income from operations of at least $6.95 billion, or $20 per share. The projection is below the company’s previous target of $20-$21 per share, Bernstein analyst Lance Wilkes said in a client note. “This increases the importance of Cigna presenting a next phase strategy to add growth segments to its PBM (pharmacy benefits management) and employer centric business.” Excluding items, Cigna posted a profit of $3.51 per share for the fourth quarter, below Refinitiv IBES estimate of $3.68."
26.889137210196946," Health insurer Cigna's quarterly revenue rises 9% Feb 4 (Reuters) - Health insurer Cigna Corp reported a 9% rise in quarterly revenue on Thursday, benefiting from its recently revamped health services unit that mainly houses its pharmacy benefits management business. Last September, the company rebranded its health services unit to Evernorth, comprising the pharmacy benefits management business it acquired through the 2018 buyout of Express Scripts, and its specialty pharmacy business Accredo. For the fourth quarter, Cigna’s medical care ratio - the amount spent on medical claims versus the income from premiums - worsened to 85.8% from 82.3%, owing to COVID-19 testing and treatment costs. U.S. health insurers including larger rival UnitedHealth and Anthem have been spending hefty amounts to support their customers with COVID-19 testing and treatment costs. Cigna said it expects to see a negative impact of about $1.25 per share due to COVID-19 costs in 2021. The company said it sees full-year consolidated adjusted income from operations of at least $6.95 billion, or $20 per share. Shareholders’ net income rose to $4.14 billion, or $11.45 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $977 million, or $2.60 per share, a year earlier. The company recorded $3.22 billion in gains from the sale of its disability and accidental death insurance unit in the quarter. Excluding one-time items, the company posted a profit of $3.51 per share. Total revenue rose to $41.71 billion from $38.25 billion.

13.462308736989344," Microsoft, Cigna form coalition for digital records of COVID-19 vaccination Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), health insurer Cigna Corp (CI.N) and Mayo Clinic are part of a coalition pushing for digital records of people who get vaccinated against COVID-19. A key aim of the project, called Vaccination Credential Initiative, is to help people store encrypted digital copies of their immunization records in a digital wallet of their choice, the companies said in a joint statement on Thursday. These records could eventually be used, with an individual's consent, by colleges that are trying to re-open or even for entry into concerts in the future, Joan Harvey, an executive at Cigna unit Evernorth told Reuters. The coalition wants to provide governments and employers access to a ""solid, widely accepted verification program"" that could help them bring people back to work and resume public events, Harvey added. The coalition has initially partnered with organizations such as hospitals and pharmacies that are administering the vaccines, said Brian Anderson from Mitre Corp, one of the members of the initiative. Other companies that are part of the initiative include Salesforce(CRM.N), Oracle Corp (ORCL.N) and Cerner Corp (CERN.O). In the United States, where vaccines from Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and Moderna Inc (MRNA.O) have been authorized for emergency use, vaccinated individuals receive a vaccination card or printout. The current system does not readily support convenient access and sharing of vaccination records, the companies said. Individuals without smartphones would receive paper-based QR codes which link to their vaccine records. "
-5.01028046562787," Breakingviews - Corona Capital: GM earnings, Third-quarter readout NEW YORK/MILAN/LONDON/MELBOURNE (Reuters Breakingviews) - Corona Capital is a column updated throughout the day by Breakingviews columnists around the world with short, sharp pandemic-related insights. - General Motors - Quarterly earnings CLUTCH MOVE. General Motors swerved around Covid-19 potholes in third-quarter results released on Thursday. The $50 billion automaker’s adjusted earnings per share of $2.83 were over twice analysts’ estimate, according to Refinitiv. U.S. consumers – possibly buoyed by stimulus or less spending on services – scooped up trucks and SUVs. Belt-tightening, like salary reductions, also helped the North American business post adjusted operating profit margins of 15% — over four percentage points higher than in the same period last year. And Covid-19 may have actually helped the financing unit. Its adjusted pre-tax earnings of $1.2 billion roughly equaled the total for the entire second half of 2019 – driven by higher used vehicle prices. Demand was likely boosted by consumers worried about public transportation. And constrained supply issues may have also pushed more toward this market. But if government stimulus fails to pump up consumer wallets and repossessions increase, some of these positive trends could go into reverse. (By Anna Szymanski) COVID RELIEF. America’s biggest companies are toughing out the pandemic. Over 80% of the S&P 500 Index members have now published third-quarter earnings, according to Refinitiv. As the period began, analysts expected them to report, on average, 25% less profit than a year earlier. As things turned out, the year-on-year earnings decline is looking like a mere 8%. Part of the explanation is an economic rebound. In the second quarter, U.S. GDP slumped 9% from a first-quarter level already dented by early lockdown damage. Last quarter, it rebounded more than 7%, according to an initial estimate from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, leaving output down 3.5% from the final three months of 2019. Full-year earnings are currently forecast to be 16% below last year’s level, with only technology and healthcare companies bucking the trend with meaningful growth. Analysts foresee 2021 more than compensating. But whether the coronavirus, the economy and whoever occupies the White House help or hinder remains up in the air. (By Richard Beales) NOW OR LATER. U.S. health insurers have had a good pandemic, but Cigna’s third-quarter results show they will do fine afterwards, too. In the year’s first half, premiums poured in but fewer people visited doctors for fear of catching Covid-19. Even if some of these are postponed indefinitely, patients are now somewhat catching up. Cigna’s medical care ratio – or the percentage of premiums spent on healthcare – rose to 82.6% compared to 80.5% in the same period last year. Earnings per share rose 6% though, beating analyst expectations on both the top and bottom line. Cigna raised its revenue estimate for the rest of the year. Even once life returns to normal, Cigna is well-positioned. The health insurance industry simply isn’t that competitive. Three-quarters of American metro areas have highly concentrated insurance markets, using the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index. That’s something even Democrats in Washington have struggled to change. (By Robert Cyran) SECOND THOUGHTS. The pandemic appears to have cured UniCredit’s funding headaches. Despite making about half of its revenue in places like Germany, Austria and Eastern Europe, the bank run by Jean-Pierre Mustier suffered a risk premium due to Italy’s wobbly public finances. This meant UniCredit had to pay more for its capital than northern European rivals. In response, Mustier even unveiled a plan last year to hive off UniCredit’s foreign operations into a sub-holding company. Such a carve-out is no longer needed, Mustier said on Thursday. The European Central Bank’s bond-buying spree has compressed Italian sovereign yields so much that the gap between Italian 10-year state bonds and their German equivalent is now just 126 basis points, from nearly 290 in mid-2019. As such, the expensive reorganisation no longer makes sense. Then again, Mustier could dust it off if M&A options materialised at home or abroad. (By Lisa Jucca) END OF THE SHOW. Milan’s famed La Scala opera house has become the latest cultural victim of the pandemic. A new lockdown set to start in Italy’s financial capital on Friday and a rash of Covid-19 infections among its musicians and singers forced the 18th-century theatre to scrap its usually bedazzling premiere, scheduled for Dec. 7, for the first time since World War Two. This will be a sad loss for all the bankers, politicians and VIPs that annually attend Italy’s most sought-after gala. Intesa Sanpaolo’s boss Carlo Messina and Generali Chairman Gabriele Galateri were among the grandees who attended “Tosca” by Giacomo Puccini at last year’s kick-off. With new restrictions halting concerts, performances and exhibitions across the country, la dolce vita is on hold. (By Lisa Jucca) CHARITABLE DONATION. Investors may be getting overexcited about Covid-19 treatments. The head of the United Kingdom’s Vaccine Taskforce said on Wednesday that AstraZeneca could release a booster by the end of the year. This could in theory see it take a share of a $10 billion market, according to analysts at Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse. The estimates assume the general public will need a dose each year and assume a price of $20 per shot. AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson have already promised to make successful vaccines available at cost during the pandemic. Although the treatment may become as ubiquitous as the annual flu jab, it will be difficult for pharmaceutical giants, already under scrutiny for price-gouging, to make too much money. Shares of companies that have promised to develop remedies are outperforming the broader index of pharmaceutical and biotechnology stocks. But not all vaccines will succeed, and pharma investors may not see the financial benefits of those that do. (By Aimee Donnellan) CASE OF RED. Pour one out for Treasury Wine Estates. The $4.2 billion Australian vintner put on hold a plan to spin off its Penfolds label amid concerns about China imposing retroactive tariffs on imports from Down Under. It has been a year to make any investor hit the bottle. A January profit warning over a glut of cheap U.S. wine sent Treasury shares tumbling 25% in a single day. Napa Valley wildfires, the pandemic hit to travel – a source of higher-margin sales – and Beijing’s anti-dumping probe have caused additional headaches. The Penfolds demerger, originally slated for next year, promised to uncork value, but the latest disappointments erased another 7% of market value. Boss Tim Ford pointed to an uptick in premium sales, or bottles that cost at least A$10 ($7.16). The company should also benefit from bars and restaurants reopening in more regions. For now, though, it’s the China fear that has legs. (By Jeffrey Goldfarb) CASH IN THE TANK. Deutsche Lufthansa’s 10 billion euro state-supplied parachute is starting to look a bit small. Lower costs and the resumption of limited flights mean the German carrier is burning through 200 million euros of cash a month. That’s a massive improvement from April, when the airline was incinerating as much as 1 million euros an hour. Worryingly, it may not be able to maintain such a lean course. Unveiling third-quarter results on Thursday, Chief Executive Carsten Spohr admitted the cash drain might climb to 350 million euros per month as the normal winter slowdown hits revenue. That implies Lufthansa’s day-to-day operations will have burnt through 2.1 billion euros by March. Throw in limited capital spending and finance charges, and Lufthansa will have eaten up more than a quarter of its reserves. Without a summer 2021 recovery, Spohr might be in need of a bigger parachute. (By Ed Cropley)"
-5.01028046562787," Cigna beats profit estimates on pharmacy benefits strength, raises FY sales view (Reuters) - Cigna Corp CI.N beat estimates for quarterly profit on Thursday and raised its full-year sales forecast, driven by higher sales in its newly revamped health services unit that mainly houses its pharmacy benefits management business. The health insurer also backed its adjusted profit forecast of $20 to $21 per share for 2021 based on the expectations of steady growth in its pharmacy benefits management business. The company, however, said it was expecting higher medical costs related to COVID-19 and a recovery in demand for healthcare services to more typical levels for the rest of the year, echoing warnings of its rivals UnitedHealth UNH.N, Anthem Inc ANTM.N and Humana Inc HUM.N. Cigna is banking on growth in the unit that offers government-backed health plans as well as Medicare Advantage plans for people over 65 or those with disabilities, to bolster its profit. It expects the Medicare Advantage business to record a 10% to 15% membership growth in 2021. For the latest quarter, adjusted revenue from Evernorth unit, which includes the Express Scripts pharmacy benefit management business it purchased in 2018, rose about 20% to $29.83 billion, driven by a 22% jump in adjusted pharmacy prescription volumes. “It is ironic to consider that a main concern for investors around buying Express Scripts is that it would slow Cigna’s growth profile when Evernorth grew revenues by 20% in the third-quarter,” Stephens analyst Scott Fidel said in a note. Cigna raised its 2020 revenue forecast to about $158 billion from $154 billion to $156 billion estimated previously. It also tightened its adjusted profit expectations, forecasting full-year earnings of $18.30 to $18.60 per share, compared with its previous expectations of $18 to $18.60.

The health insurer in September rebranded the unit to Evernorth, comprising the pharmacy benefits management business it acquired through the 2018 buyout of Express Scripts as well as its specialty pharmacy business Accredo. Adjusted revenue from Evernorth rose about 20% to $29.83 billion in the third-quarter, driven by a 22% jump in adjusted pharmacy prescription volumes. The company raised its 2020 revenue target to about $158 billion, from its previous outlook of $154 billion to $156 billion. It also raised the lower end of its adjusted profit expectations, forecasting full-year adjusted earnings of $18.30 to $18.60 per share compared with the previous $18.00 to $18.60. Cigna’s medical care ratio - the amount spent on medical claims versus the income from premiums - worsened to 82.6% in the quarter from 80.5% a year ago, as demand began to normalize for elective healthcare services that were postponed during the height of the pandemic. Rivals UnitedHealth, Anthem Inc and Humana Inc have also warned of higher costs in the second half of the year as demand for healthcare services normalizes and due to COVID-19 testing and treatment related expenses, but stuck to their long-term growth forecasts. The health insurer said net income attributable to shareholders rose to $1.39 billion, or $3.78 per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, from $1.35 billion, or $3.57 per share, a year earlier.

-6.443654943182128," Cigna profit gets boost from lower costs as patients delay surgery (Reuters) - Health insurer Cigna Corp CI.N beat Wall Street expectations for second-quarter profit on Thursday, helped by lower medical costs from delayed surgical procedures and strong sales from its pharmacy benefits business. The company, like rivals UnitedHealth Group Inc UNH.N and Anthem Inc ANTM.N, warned of increased medical costs during the second half as the lifting of lockdowns could lead to a rise in non-emergency surgical procedures that patients had put off due to the pandemic. Chief Financial Officer Eric Palmer said medical utilization was expected to rise in the balance of the year, with additional costs related to COVID-19 treatment. Cigna, however, reiterated its targets for the year despite challenges it expects to face. “COVID-19 costs will continue to rise just as the cases will continue to grow ... However, the assumptions that the companies are building in around the non-COVID-19 related healthcare utilization probably accelerating in the back half of the year may be overly conservative,” Stephens analyst Scott Fidel said. Cigna’s medical care ratio, which compares expenses related to medical claims with income from premiums, improved to 70.5% in the second quarter from 81.6% a year earlier. The company, however, said healthcare utilization trends in July mirrored those in June and were only marginally below pre-pandemic levels. As a result, it expects to pay out more in medical claims in the back half of 2020. Sales in its health services unit, which includes Express Scripts, rose nearly 22% to $28.6 billion. The growth was driven by a 24% jump in adjusted pharmacy script volumes as it redirected prescriptions to Express Scripts from UnitedHealth’s OptumRx. Excluding items, Cigna reported a profit of $5.81 per share, beating estimates of $5.15 per share, according to Refinitiv IBES data. Cigna shares fell 1.7%, in line with the broader market."

As Americans delayed elective surgeries and avoided hospital visits during nationwide shelter-in-place restrictions, healthcare spending costs declined, benefiting health insurers. Rivals UnitedHealth Group Inc and Anthem Inc , however, warned of higher medical costs in the second half of the year as people begin to catch up on delayed procedures. Like its rivals, Cigna also reaffirmed its previously given financial targets for the year. The company continues to see full-year sales of $154 billion to $156 billion and adjusted profit from operations between $18 and $18.60 per share. Sales in its health services segment, which includes Express Scripts, rose nearly 22% to $28.6 billion in the second quarter from a year earlier. The growth was driven by a 24% jump in adjusted pharmacy script volumes. The health insurer said net income rose to $1.75 billion, or $4.73 per share, in the quarter ended June 30, from $1.41 billion, or $3.70 per share, a year earlier.

-5.449624199688165," Fitch Affirms Cigna's 'BBB' Debt Ratings; Outlook Stable (The following statement was released by the rating agency) Fitch Ratings-Chicago-May 20: Fitch Ratings has affirmed the Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) ratings of Cigna Corporation’s operating subsidiaries at ‘A’ (Strong) and Cigna’s Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at ‘BBB’/Outlook Stable. Additionally, Fitch has maintained the Rating Watch Positive on the ‘A’ IFS ratings of Cigna’s operating subsidiaries, Life Insurance Company of North America (LINA) and CIGNA Life Insurance Company of New York (CLICNY), reflecting the pending sale to of these entities to New York Life (NYL). Key Rating Drivers The rating actions noted above are based on Fitch’s current assessment of the impact of the coronavirus pandemic, including its economic impact, under a set of ratings assumptions described below. These assumptions were used by Fitch to develop pro-forma financial metrics for Cigna that Fitch compared with both ratings guidelines defined in its criteria, and relative to previously established Rating Sensitivities for Cigna. For Cigna, the key credit factor potentially most significantly affected by the coronavirus is financial leverage as measured by debt/EBITDA due to a modest decline in financial performance and earnings. Under the assumptions described below, Cigna’s EBITDA margin declines to approximately 7.1% relative to a 2019 actual level of 7.6%. As a result, debt/EBITDA increases to approximately 3.4x relative to the company’s 2019 actual level of 3.2x. Despite the modest decline in margin, the previously established downgrade sensitivity of 4.0x or higher debt/EBITDA ratio is not breached. Key Assumptions Assumptions for Coronavirus Impact (Rating Case): Fitch used the following key assumptions in support of the pro-forma ratings analysis discussed above: --Decline in key stock market indices by 35% relative to Jan. 1, 2020; --Increase in two-year cumulative high yield bond default rate to approximately 16%, applied to current non-investment grade assets, as well as 12% of ‘BBB’ assets; --Both upward and downward pressure on interest rates, with spreads widening (including high yield by 400 basis points) coupled with notable declines in government rates; --Capital markets access is limited for issuers at senior debt levels of ‘BBB’ and below; --A COVID-19 infection rate of 5%; --An average hospitalization rate of 15% of confirmed infections. The ratings remain sensitive to any material change in Fitch’s Rating Case assumptions with respect the coronavirus pandemic. Periodic updates to Fitch’s assumptions are possible given the rapid pace of changes in government actions in response to the pandemic, and the pace with which new information is available on the medical aspects of the outbreak. A discussion of how ratings would be expected to be affected under a set of Stress Case assumptions is included at the end of this section to help frame sensitivities to a severe downside scenario. Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to negative rating action/downgrade: --A material adverse change in Fitch’s Ratings Assumptions with respect coronavirus impact; --A failure to successfully integrate Express Scripts as reflected by a material deviation in operating results from projections; --A sustained deterioration in the debt/EBITDA ratio to 4.0x or worse. Factors that could, individually or collectively, lead to positive rating action/upgrade: --A material positive change Fitch’s Rating Assumptions with respect to the coronavirus impact; --A positive rating action is prefaced by Fitch’s ability to reliably forecast the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on the financial profile of both the North American health insurance sector of the insurance industry and Cigna; --Demonstration of successful integration of Express Scripts, including sustained profit margins of its business, which could result in an improvement in Fitch’s assessment of Cigna’s business profile; --An improvement in debt/EBITDA to a level below 2.5x. The following sensitivities could result in an upgrade of Short-Term Ratings: --Further deleveraging to of holding company to allow for a further strengthening of liquidity, and in turn, the financial structure to withstand sensitivity testing for reductions in regulated cash flows. The following sensitivities could result in an upgrade of LINA and CLICNY’s ratings: --Transaction to close on stated terms. The following sensitivities could result in an affirmation of and removal of the Positive Watch on LINA’s and CLICNY’s ratings: --Transaction fails to close on stated terms. Stress Case Sensitivity Analysis Fitch’s Stress Case assumes a 60% stock market decline, two-year cumulative high yield bond default rate of 22%, high yield bond spreads widening by 600 basis points and more prolonged declines in government rates, heightened pressure on capital markets access, and a COVID-19 infection rate of 15%; --The implied rating impact under the Stress Case would be a downgrade of up to 1 notch. Best/Worst Case Rating Scenario International scale credit ratings of Financial Institutions issuers have a best-case rating upgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a positive direction) of three notches over a three-year rating horizon; and a worst-case rating downgrade scenario (defined as the 99th percentile of rating transitions, measured in a negative direction) of four notches over three years. The complete span of best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings for all rating categories ranges from 'AAA' to 'D'. Best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings are based on historical performance. For more information about the methodology used to determine sector-specific best- and worst-case scenario credit ratings, visit here. REFERENCES FOR SUBSTANTIALLY MATERIAL SOURCE CITED AS KEY DRIVER OF RATING The principal sources of information used in the analysis are described in the Applicable Criteria. ESG Considerations The highest level of ESG credit relevance, if present, is a score of 3.

The manner of Fitch’s factual investigation and the scope of the third-party verification it obtains will vary depending on the nature of the rated security and its issuer, the requirements and practices in the jurisdiction in which the rated security is offered and sold and/or the issuer is located, the availability and nature of relevant public information, access to the management of the issuer and its advisers, the availability of pre-existing third-party verifications such as audit reports, agreed-upon procedures letters, appraisals, actuarial reports, engineering reports, legal opinions and other reports provided by third parties, the availability of independent and competent third- party verification sources with respect to the particular security or in the particular jurisdiction of the issuer, and a variety of other factors.

-3.2522513509048827," Cigna's Express Scripts offers discounted drugs for U.S. newly unemployed NEW YORK (Reuters) - Express Scripts is offering discounted $25 and $75 prescription drug prices to the newly uninsured, a stop-gap measure aimed at Americans who lose their jobs and health insurance due to the coronavirus pandemic. The U.S. pharmacy benefit manager owned by Cigna Corp said the offer included thousands of generic drugs, which would be priced at $25 and branded medications priced at $75. Express said the offer, which is temporary, includes drugs for asthma, diabetes drug, glaucoma, heart disease, migraine, reproductive health, seizures and thyroid conditions. The discount level will vary because of the wide range in retail prices for generic and branded drugs in the United States. Trulicity, a diabetes treatment from Eli Lilly and Co included in the scheme, is listed at $694 on the GoodRx pharmacy website, where Vyzulta, an eye drop made by Bausch Health Cos, costs around $220. Meanwhile, Airduo, an asthma inhaler made by Teva Pharmaceuticals, costs about $50. The White House on Tuesday estimated the unemployment rate in April was 16% to 20%, representing more than 20 million jobs lost, as social distancing and shelter-in-place orders aimed at curbing the coronavirus shut all but essential services. More than half of Americans have health insurance through their employers, while others buy individual health insurance plans, some of which include government income-based subsidies. Some get Medicaid benefits for the poor or have healthcare paid for by the Medicare program for disabled people and those aged 65 or older, while others have no insurance at all. Express said that more than 40 branded medications in its program would come from drugmakers including AstraZeneca PLC, Bayer AG, Eli Lilly and Co , Merck & Co, Pfizer Inc, Sanofi SA and UCB SA. Discounts in the scheme, dubbed ParachuteRx, originate partly from manufacturers as well as pharmacies, Express said, adding that the drugs are available by mail and at most pharmacies including Walgreens Boots Alliance, CVS Health Corp and Rite Aid Corp."

-8.841561250884443," Cigna confident of meeting 2021 profit target despite virus-led crisis (Reuters) - Cigna Corp CI.N on Thursday reaffirmed its profit goals for this year and the next, expecting its $52 billion acquisition of pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts to tide over the COVID-19-triggered global economic meltdown. Shares of the health insurer were up 1.1% at $198. Cigna’s Express Scripts business though modestly vulnerable to job losses during a recession, is well diversified to weather the hit, Chief Financial Officer Eric Palmer said. The company said while the impact of the pandemic is still developing, the recession could affect enrollment in employer-sponsored health plans. But for now some of its employer customers are maintaining employees’ health benefits. Corporations see this as a more temporary dislocation of their business, and hence, want to maintain positive ties with their workers, Chief Executive Officer David Cordani said. Cordani also said medical costs from the COVID-19 pandemic could be offset by deferred health care procedures due to the health crisis. Despite meaningful pressure on employer-sponsored health plans and cost pressures due to phased recovery in health care utilization, Cigna can still meet its 2021 profit goal, Stephens analyst Scott Fidel said. Rivals including UnitedHealth Group Inc UNH.N, Anthem Inc ANTM.N and Humana Inc HUM.N have also reaffirmed their profit estimates for 2020, even as they warned of higher costs from resumption in elective surgeries deferred due to the COVID-19 pandemic. While health insurers benefit from the deferred health care in the first half of the year, the gains could be short lived, depending on how quickly the virus outbreak subsides and the healthcare business returns to near normal, according to a Reuters analysis. Some U.S. states such as Ohio and Florida have already disclosed plans to resume elective surgeries and procedures. Cigna said it continues to expect 2020 adjusted income from operations to be between $18 and $18.60 per share. Analysts were expecting $18.32 per share, according to Refinitiv IBES data. The company also reaffirmed its 2021 adjusted profit target of between $20 and $21 per share. Excluding items, the company earned $4.69 per share in the first quarter, beating the average analyst estimate of $4.35, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Cigna said growth in its adjusted sales for the first quarter was boosted by higher enrollment in its Medicare Advantage health plans, meant for people older than 65 or those with disabilities, as well as a jump in the premiums collected."

-8.841561250884443," Health insurer Cigna posts rise in sales, reaffirms 2020 profit goal April 30 (Reuters) - Cigna Corp on Thursday reported a 1.4% rise in quarterly sales, benefiting from premiums and strength in its health services unit, which includes the Express Scripts pharmacy benefits business it acquired in 2018. The health insurer, like rivals UnitedHealth Group Inc , Anthem Inc and Humana Inc, also reiterated its 2020 profit target. Cigna said it continues to expect 2020 adjusted income from operations to be between $18 and $18.60 per share. Analysts were expecting $18.32 per share, according to Refinitiv IBES data. For the first quarter, adjusted revenue from the health services business rose nearly 21% to $27.17 billion. Analysts had expected the business to gain as people refilled prescription medications for a longer period to stock up on their medicines before the virus-led lockdowns, while others turned to mail order pharmacy services during the period. The company’s medical care ratio - the amount spent on medical claims versus the income from premiums - improved to 78.3% in the quarter, from 78.9% in the year earlier, but marginally fell short of estimates of 78.2%. Net income fell to $1.18 billion, or $3.15 per share, in the quarter ended March 31, from $1.37 billion, or $3.56 per share, a year earlier. Total revenue rose to $38.47 billion from $37.95 billion."

4.276541704724181," U.S. insurers working to ease coronavirus out-of-pocket costs (Reuters) - The U.S. health insurance industry’s largest trade group on Thursday said it is addressing prevention, testing and treatment for the new coronavirus, including making sure that out-of-pocket costs do not prevent people from seeking care. America's Health Insurance Plans (AHIP) said its members, which include Cigna Corp CI.N and Anthem Inc ANTM.N, will cover diagnostic testing when ordered by a doctor, ease network, referral and prior authorization requirements and/or waive patient cost sharing. The group also said it will “take action so that patients will have continuous access to their regular prescription medications.” Washington state on Thursday issued an emergency order requiring all state-regulated health insurers to waive co-payments and deductibles for any consumer requiring testing for the new coronavirus. Some healthcare experts have expressed concern that the type of patient cost sharing seen in many U.S. health plans might make some Americans hesitate to visit a doctor, even if they have valid reasons to be concerned about contracting the virus. Cigna, in a separate statement, said its customers will have access to COVID-19 testing, as prescribed by health practitioners, and the insurer will waive all co-pays or cost-shares to help fight the rapid spread of the virus. Cigna said it will cover the medical test similar to a preventive benefit for fully-insured plans - waiving co-pays, coinsurance or deductibles for customers. Those plans include Cigna’s employer-sponsored plans in the United States, Medicare Advantage, Medicaid and the Individual & Family plans available through the Affordable Care Act. The insurer said organizations that offer Administrative Services Only (ASO) plans will also have the option to include coronavirus testing as a preventive benefit. Washington state’s order also says that if an insurer does not have enough medical providers in its network to provide testing and treatment for COVID-19, it must allow enrollees to be treated by another provider within a reasonable distance at no additional cost. The fast-spreading coronavirus has reached some 80 nations with more new cases now reported outside China where the flu-like illness first emerged late last year. The U.S. death toll from COVID-19 stands at 12. More than 3,200 worldwide have died from the respiratory illness that can lead to pneumonia. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Thursday reported 149 confirmed and presumed U.S. cases. They are presumed not to include any of the new cases reported on Thursday."

-6.612339714310458," Cigna closes $54 billion purchase of Express Scripts NEW YORK (Reuters) - Cigna Corp CI.N on Thursday closed its $54-billion deal to buy Express Scripts Holding Co, creating one of the biggest providers of pharmacy benefits and insurance plans in the United States, a combination it says will help it improve healthcare coordination and cut costs. Cigna's deal puts it in direct competition with two other healthcare companies set up the same way - Aetna with CVS Health Corp CVS.N and UnitedHealth Group Inc UNH.N with Optum. Cigna's deal has already passed antitrust scrutiny. Cigna will start offering new products next year to its corporate health insurance customers, including access to Express Scripts’ specialty pharmacy, which has cost savings programs in treatment areas such as cancer, its top executive said in an interview on Thursday. Prescription drugs that require special handling and are delivered to a doctor’s office or patient home by specialty pharmacies are a growing part of employer healthcare spending and rising U.S. drug costs. Many new drugs costs tens of thousands of dollars when they are launched and drugmakers raise the price of older drugs once or twice a year. The company will also try to improve products and services by integrating healthcare data, he said. “There’s a lot of data available today but it’s either not aggregated in a singular place or coalesced in a way that’s intuitive,” Cigna Chief Executive Officer David Cordani said in an interview."

-10.273717948506523," Cigna boosts 2018 forecast after third quarter earnings beat (Reuters) - U.S. health insurer Cigna Corp CI.N, which is in the process of acquiring Express Scripts Holding Co ESRX.O, significantly bumped up its 2018 adjusted profit forecast, and its shares rose more than 3 percent on Thursday. The company beat Wall Street expectations for quarterly profit by 40 cents per share as it kept a tight rein on medical costs across its businesses, but the new 2018 forecast of $14.20 to $14.40 per share raises the midpoint from its prior outlook by 55 cents. “The guidance raise in excess of the magnitude of the earnings beat this quarter signals Cigna’s confidence in its industry-leading medical cost performance,” Leerink analyst Ana Gupte said. Cigna’s $52 billion buy of pharmacy benefits manager Express Scripts is on track to close by the end of the year, after which the company expects to focus on paying down debt. “Over the immediate term ... our capital priorities are quite clear. We’re very well positioned ... to aggressively pay down our debt levels in the first 18 to 24 months,” Chief Executive Officer David Cordani said on a conference call. “As we look beyond that, we’re going to have a tremendous capital flexibility,” he added. Cigna's Express Scripts deal, and CVS Health Corp's CVS.N $69 billion acquisition of Cigna rival Aetna Inc AET.N signals a changing healthcare landscape as companies work to cut costs and brace for the threat of disruptive players such as Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O moving into the healthcare arena. Cigna is banking on the Express Scripts deal to help lower client expenses and cushion the impact of increases in the cost of medical services.

The vote in favor of the merger was on expected lines after activist investor Carl Icahn walked away last week from his 11th-hour attempt to rally shareholders to reject the deal. The U.S. Department of Justice is still conducting an antitrust review of the combination that is not expected to close until later this year. According to the preliminary results, about 90 percent of the votes cast were in favor of the merger, the health insurer said. Cigna expects the merger to close by end of 2018. The insurer agreed to buy Express Scripts in March saying the two companies could save more on healthcare costs for clients if they better coordinated medical care with prescriptions. But since then Express Scripts has come under stiffer opposition from the Trump administration, lawmakers and drug makers as being a middleman that drives up drug costs. Icahn had argued that Cigna was overpaying given prospects for reduced profits. He backed down after shareholder advisory groups recommended that shareholders vote for the deal. Express Scripts shareholders also approved the deal, with about 78 percent of outstanding shares of Express Scripts voted for the deal. Cigna's plan for the acquisition comes as Express Scripts' major rival CVS Health CVS.N and Aetna Inc AET.N move forward on their own merger. Cigna's deal to be bought by Anthem Inc ANTM.N fell apart last year after it failed to pass antitrust review. Cigna shares slipped 0.10 percent, while Express Scripts rose 0.47 percent."

Icahn’s comments come after proxy advisory firms Glass Lewis & Co and Institutional Shareholder Services Inc (ISS), as well as hedge fund Glenview Capital Management, extended their support for the deal. “In light of the ISS and Glass Lewis recommendations in favor of the Cigna/Express Scripts transaction and the significant stockholder overlap between the two companies, we have informed the SEC (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) that we no longer intend to solicit proxies to vote against the transaction,” Icahn said in a statement.

ISS, whose recommendations are followed by major mutual funds, said for investors with exposure to both companies the potential benefits outweigh the risks, “especially given that these risks are, to some degree, unavoidable.” However, the firm noted that the merger presents a more difficult decision for Cigna investors, highlighting the worsening environment for pharmacy benefits managers.

Glenview, which has been an investor in Cigna for a decade, said it has nearly $1.3 billion stake in Cigna and Express Scripts, split almost evenly between the two companies. The hedge fund said it purchased a significant stake in Express Scripts and increased its investment in Cigna following the $52 billion deal announcement in March. “Contrary to the sensationalist rhetoric of those pushing personal agendas, PBMs combat drug price inflation and encourage better pharmaceutical adherence,” Glenview said, adding the deal would strengthen Cigna’s growth prospects. PBMs have come under increasing scrutiny in the drug pricing debate, with the Trump administration proposing a rule that would scale back protections in place that allow rebates between drug manufacturers, insurers and PBMs. Rebates have been cited as one of the reasons for escalating drug prices, but PBMs such as CVS Health CVS.N have downplayed its importance to their business. Express Scripts shares rose 3.4 percent to $81.57, while Cigna shares fell 1.8 percent to $186.06. Icahn, who has a 0.56 percent stake in Cigna, on Tuesday made public his opposition to the health insurer's deal, citing regulatory hurdles and the growing threat from Amazon AMZN.O. “Everyone wants drug prices lower — it is a bipartisan issue. I have little doubt that legislation will ultimately be passed to do away with rebates,” Icahn said in a letter on Thursday. The 82-year-old billionaire has also highlighted the rising threat of Amazon, which in June bought small online pharmacy PillPack, putting the world’s biggest online retailer in direct competition with drugstore chains, drug distributors and PBMs. Last week, Cigna said it was confident it would secure shareholder approval for the deal. The vote is set for Aug. 24. The insurer also said on Tuesday it strongly disagrees with Icahn. “Mr. Icahn has made clear through his recent and limited entry into Cigna stock and ‘substantial’ short position in Express Scripts that his motives are not aligned with Cigna’s shareholders and he has no interest in creating value for shareholders (other than himself).”"

17.007480482304988," Icahn urges Cigna shareholders to vote against Express Scripts deal (Reuters) - Activist investor Carl Icahn on Tuesday urged Cigna Corp CI.N shareholders to vote against the health insurer's $52 billion purchase of Express Scripts Holding Co ESRX.O, citing regulatory hurdles and the growing threat from Amazon. The Cigna-Express Scripts deal has drawn investor skepticism over concerns that Amazon.com Inc's AMZN.O entry into healthcare will upend the sector at a time when U.S. President Donald Trump has made a push to lower drug prices. “Cigna is dramatically overpaying for a highly challenged Express Scripts that is facing existential risks,” Icahn wrote in an open letter about the deal. The Trump administration has proposed a rule that would scale back protections currently in place that allow rebates between drug manufacturers and insurers and pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs). Icahn said the rule, which was proposed after Cigna and Express Scripts agreed to merge, is a clear shot across the bow for the PBM industry, saying the industry will likely move to charging fees, instead of using rebates, over time. The 82-year old billionaire also highlighted the rising threat of Amazon, which in June bought small online pharmacy PillPack, putting the world’s biggest online retailer in direct competition with drugstore chains, drug distributors and PBMs. Icahn, who has spent decades battling some of America’s most widely recognized corporations, owns only 1.36 million shares, or 0.56 percent, of Cigna, and has a short position that bets Express Scripts’ stock will fall. He is now trying to convince other investors to vote against the deal and has scheduled dozens of telephone conversations with Cigna’s top 100 shareholders to discuss the matter, according to a person familiar with the matter, who declined to name the investors who will be speaking with Icahn. The vote is scheduled for Aug. 24.. Peter Harkins, a managing director at Harkins Kovler LLC, the proxy solicitor working for Icahn, said in an interview that it helps “to own a lot of stock, but in the end it is the power of the idea that drives success in these campaigns.” Cigna said in a statement that it strongly disagrees with Icahn. “Mr. Icahn has made clear through his recent and limited entry into Cigna stock and ‘substantial’ short position in Express Scripts that his motives are not aligned with Cigna’s shareholders and he has no interest in creating value for shareholders (other than himself).” Express Scripts spokesman Brian Henry said in a statement, “We believe we are well positioned for growth and remain confident in the deal.” One idea would be for Cigna to use the cash it earmarked for the merger to repurchase some of its own shares, a move that could push its share price to $250 over time, Icahn wrote. He also suggested Cigna pursue a partnership with existing pharmacy benefit managers, including Express Scripts. Cigna’s stock is currently trading around $188, having climbed more than 6 percent in the last five days. Express Scripts’ shares rose 2.7 percent on Tuesday to close at $78.95. Some analysts have questioned Icahn’s ability to sway other investors because there is only a limited time before the vote and few shareholders have previously questioned the strategic rationale of the deal. Leerink analyst Ana Gupte said a majority of current shareholders are likely to vote in favor of the deal, given a large shareholder overlap between the two companies."

Cordani said shareholders would vote in the company’s favor, based on the strategic rationale of the transaction and ongoing conversation the insurer has had with its shareholders. The vote is due on Aug. 24. Cigna did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comments on Icahn’s stake, which reports said was less than 5 percent.

Cigna’s shares closed up 2.0 percent on Wednesday afternoon, while Express Scripts’ stock slid nearly 7.0 percent. Express Scripts shares have been trading well below the value of Cigna’s bid. The arbitrage spread of the deal, which measures that difference, widened to more than 25 percent from 18 percent after Icahn’s stake was revealed, suggesting investor skepticism the deal can close. “Clearly there had been shareholder disappointment and discontent post the transaction announcement,” Evercore ISI analysts Mike Newshel and Ross Muken said in a research note Express Scripts business model is in question, and on its own would likely be worth $57 to $62 a share, they said. Cigna would be better off doing a share buyback of $7 billion to $10 billion, buying smaller pharmacy benefit managers, and increasing its government paid business, they said.

Neither Icahn nor Cigna immediately responded to Reuters’ requests for comment. Express Scripts spokesman Brian Henry said the deal would “deliver significant value to shareholders.” Cigna announced the deal in March, looking for new ways to boost profits as the industry faces greater scrutiny for rising healthcare costs. They say the deal could generate $600 million in savings per year and help Cigna more closely manage how costly drugs are prescribed and delivered to patients. But headwinds for the companies have strengthened since the deal was announced. Pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs) like Express Scripts have been in the crosshairs of the Trump administration, which is looking at scaling back or eliminating rebates from drug purchases that are diverted to middlemen like PBMs. Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O has also purchased an online pharmacy that Wall Street analysts say can help it undercut traditional prescription drug sales. The deal followed the $69 billion merger announced in December between CVS Health Corp CVS.N and health insurer Aetna Inc AET.N. Shareholders from those companies approved the CVS-Aetna tie-up in March, but they are still awaiting antitrust approval."

9.468992282886536," Cigna first quarter profit beats but shares drop on Express Scripts worries (Reuters) - Cigna Corp CI.N reported a better-than-expected quarterly profit and raised its full-year forecast on Thursday, but investors remained concerned about its planned $52 billion acquisition of Express Scripts Holding Co ESRX.O, sending shares 2.6 percent lower. Chief Executive Officer David Cordani said during a conference call with analysts he expected the deal for the pharmacy benefits manager to close this year. But investors still wondered if the purchase will pass muster with antitrust regulators. And if so, what will the profitability be for companies like Express Scripts, which act as a middleman between drug companies and health plans and are under pressure to change how they handle drug discounts. “Things look good for them on a standalone basis, but the market is still concerned about the transaction,” Evercore ISI analyst Michael Newshel said. Cigna shares fell $4.42 to $167.94, and have fallen more than 10 percent since the deal was announced in March. Health insurers are trying to change their businesses to drive down soaring costs. Aetna is being bought by CVS Health Corp CVS.N in a $69 billion deal, and CVS hopes to cut costs by offering more health care services in pharmacies. Cordani said he has told shareholders that buying Express Scripts will help cut client costs and enable Cigna to reduce increases in the cost of medical services. Last year, medical costs for Cigna and its customers rose 3 percent, on average, and its 2021 goal is to lower cost increases to match the rise in the consumer price index. “We think that’s what the market demands,” Cordani said.
