-2.869222030961183," U.S. property trust Vornado challenges Arcadia's restructuring plan (Reuters) - Philip Green's fashion empire Arcadia Group said on Tuesday it received applications from legal entities of U.S.-based property group Vornado VNO.N challenging two of its seven planned Company Voluntary Agreements (CVAs). Arcadia said the challenges to the CVAs, which were approved in June by the majority of creditors, were “without merit” and it would defend itself against them. Vornado, a landlord to some of the Topshop and Topman stores in New York, was not available to respond to Reuters request for a comment outside of business hours. Arcadia's other landlords include British Land BLND.L, Intu Properties INTUP.L, Aviva AV.L and Land Securities LAND.L. CVAs have been carried out by several British retailers, including fashion chain New Look, floor coverings firm Carpetright CPRC.L, mother-and-baby goods group Mothercare MTC.L and department store chains House of Fraser and Debenhams. Landlords of UK retail property, however, are starting to fight back against tenants proposing CVAs in order to close stores and reduce their rent burden. Earlier in the month, Debenhams said M&G Real Estate had agreed to withdraw the court action related to its CVA that wiped out investors but kept the company operating. The company has also been challenged by former shareholder Sports Direct SPD.L over the plan. Arcadia’s restructuring will close stores, cut rents and make changes to the funding of the group’s pension schemes, but it will enable it to keep operating under the Green family’s ownership. “Our Group continues to trade as normal and we remain focused on delivering our turnaround plans,” Arcadia Group Chief Executive Ian Grabiner said in an email statement."

-2.8872675660344087," Abu Dhabi sovereign fund buys full ownership of New York office block ABU DHABI (Reuters) - Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA) said on Wednesday it had bought a 25% stake in 330 Madison Avenue from Vornado Realty Trust, gaining full ownership of the office block close to New York’s Grand Central Station. ADIA, which the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute estimates manages nearly $700 billion in assets, has between 5% to 10% of its portfolio in real estate. The stake was bought by a subsidiary of ADIA, a spokesman of ADIA told Reuters, adding ADIA already owned 75% of the property for 30 years. ADIA did not disclose the value of the deal, but Vornado said on Monday it had agreed to sell its interest in the property as part of a “buy/sell process initiated by its 75% partner at a $900 million valuation.” The deal is expected to close in the third quarter of this year. Gulf sovereign wealth funds, especially Abu Dhabi and Qatari funds, have for decades been investing in commercial real estate in Europe and the United States. Vornado recently sold a non-controlling stake in its portfolio of New York properties along Fifth Avenue and Broadway in Times Square to Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) and private realty firm Crown Acquisitions in a transaction that provided the firm cash proceeds of about $1.2 billion. Headquartered in the oil-rich capital of the United Arab Emirates, ADIA manages a global investment portfolio across more than two dozen asset classes."
-3.6757791458183635," Qatar's sovereign fund, Crown Acquisitions named as investors in $5.6 billion New York deal NEW YORK/DUBAI (Reuters) - Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) and private realty firm Crown Acquisitions said on Friday they were the unnamed investors in a deal with Vornado Realty Trust valued at $5.56 billion that involves a portfolio of prime New York retail properties. Vornado sold a non-controlling stake in its portfolio of properties along Fifth Avenue and Broadway in Times Square in a transaction that provided the firm cash proceeds of about $1.2 billion, the firm said on Thursday. Neither QIA, Qatar’s sovereign wealth fund, or Crown Acquisitions were named on Thursday as the investors who contributed $1.31 billion in cash in a newly created joint venture with Vornado. QIA and Crown Acquisitions, which acted as an advisor to the deal, said they acquired a 24% stake each in a portfolio of five ground-level stores along a swath of Fifth Avenue just north of St. Patrick’s Cathedral and two sites in Times Square. The deal comprised $950 million of mortgage debt, $1.83 billion of preferred equity entirely held by Vornado and $2.78 billion of common equity in which Vornado holds 51%. The portfolio include stores at 666 Fifth Avenue, a building that has been in the news because it was owned by the family of Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of President Donald Trump, until Brookfield Asset Management bought a 99-year lease on the office portion last August. QIA Chief Executive Mansoor al-Mahmoud said in a statement the investment underlined QIA’s ambition to boost its U.S. investments to $45 billion in coming years and “our belief in the exciting long-term possibilities offered by New York City.” The retail portfolio includes such brands as MAC, Polo, Forever 21 and Disney. QIA also is an investor in Brookfield and the transaction at 666 Fifth Avenue involving Kushner Cos had prompted a rethink of how the gas-rich kingdom invests money abroad via the sovereign wealth fund, two sources told Reuters earlier this year. Qatar had decided that QIA would aim to avoid investing in funds or other vehicles it does not fully control, according to the sources, who are familiar with the strategy. Qatar, whose wealth comes from the world’s largest exports of liquefied natural gas, manages about $300 billion in assets. Mahmoud told Reuters in December the fund was focusing on “classic” investments in the West such as real estate and financial institutions, and would also accelerate investment in technology and healthcare. With oil and gas prices growing over the past two years, Qatar has not departed from what it is best known for - snapping up big-name properties."

-1.9578657145740628," Vornado sells stake in New York retail venture for $1.2 billion (Reuters) - Vornado Realty Trust on Thursday sold a stake in a portfolio of prime New York retail properties along Fifth Avenue and Broadway in Times Square for about $1.2 billion in cash in a deal in which it retains majority control of the assets. The transaction created a joint venture with unnamed institutional investors that valued the portfolio of seven retail sites and other assets at $5.56 billion, said Vornado, a real estate investment trust, said in a statement. The retail assets are among the scarcest and most valuable in the world, Vornado Chairman Steve Roth said in the statement. Vornado will be the general partner of the venture and own 51.0% of its common equity and 100% of its debt and preferred equity. Vornado will have a tax gain of about $735 million. How the cash proceeds will be used was not disclosed. Vornado spokeswoman Wendi Kopsick did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Two weeks ago Vornado said that $1.04 billion in proceeds from the sale of condos at 220 Central Park South will provide capital for its massive redevelopment of two office towers above Penn Station and a portion of the nearby Farley Post Office. Family-controlled realty company Crown Acquisitions advised the investor group on the transaction and Haim Chera, a Crown principal, joined Vornado as its head of retail, Roth said."
-6.858198652102561," Vornado reports $7.3 million gain from 666 Fifth Avenue mortgage sale NEW YORK (Reuters) - Vornado Realty Trust VNO.N said on Wednesday the repayment of a mortgage after the sale of its stake in a Manhattan office tower formerly controlled by the family of President Donald Trump's son-in-law would result in $7.3 million of net income. The amount is less than an $8 million gain Vornado had previously said it expected to report on its third-quarter financial statement. A financial statement gain of $134 million was as expected, Vornado said in a regulatory filing. Vornado reported in August it had completed the sale of its 49.5 percent stake in the office portion of 666 Fifth Avenue, a flagship holding once overseen by Jared Kushner, who is married to Trump’s daughter Ivanka. Vornado at the time reported net proceeds from the sale were about $120 million and that the existing mortgage loan was repaid. Canada’s Brookfield Asset Management said at the time that it had acquired a 99-year lease-hold on the tower."
-5.219814420336219," Brookfield gains lease on Kushner's landmark New York tower NEW YORK (Reuters) - Canada’s Brookfield Asset Management said on Friday it acquired a 99-year lease on a flagship New York office tower controlled by the family of Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of U.S. President Donald Trump, capping a long saga to refinance the building. Brookfield said it gained a leasehold on the office portion of 666 Fifth Avenue, a marquee property whose $1.8 billion sale to Kushner Companies in 2006 was the highest price paid for a New York office building at the time. Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed. Toronto-based Brookfield said in a statement that its unit, Brookfield Properties, will operate the 1.5 million square foot (139,000 square meter) building. It plans a major redevelopment of the tower, which occupies the west side of an entire block on Fifth Avenue, just north of St. Patrick’s Cathedral. The tower has the potential to be one of New York’s best-known and most successful office properties, Brookfield said, adding that it was “well placed to capitalize on the opportunity.” Upgrades and renovation will cost between $600 million and $700 million, a source with knowledge of the plans said. Brookfield declined to comment further on the transaction. A Kushner spokeswoman declined to comment. Brookfield owns and operates more than 275 office buildings around the world, with about $160 billion in real estate assets under management. Proceeds from the transaction would give the Kushner family enough to pay off more than $1.1 billion of debt on the building and buy out its partner, Vornado Realty Trust, according to the Wall Street Journal, which broke news about the deal on Friday. Vornado said in a statement that it had completed the sale of its 49.5 stake in the tower’s office portion to a Kushner affiliate and that net proceeds were about $120 million, an agreement it had announced in June. The existing mortgage loan was repaid too, it said. Vornado also said it would continue to own its portion of the building’s prized retail frontage on Fifth Avenue, which it bought in 2012 for $707.8 million from the Carlyle Group. Vornado acquired its office stake in 2011 when it helped recapitalize the tower with $70 million after the debt entered receivership, a sign of Kushner difficulties financing the building. Vornado has made close to a 10 percent return over the life of its investment, said Alex Goldfarb, an analyst with Sandler O’Neill + Partners. Kushner Companies said a year ago it was reassessing how to finance the tower’s redevelopment after talks that had begun several years earlier failed. Jared, who is married to Trump’s daughter Ivanka, sold his interests in the company to a family trust in 2017."
