17.99933414983757," Western Union hopeful of resuming Cuba services: CFO LONDON (Reuters) - Western Union is hopeful it will be able to resume offering money transfer services to Cuba as it looks forward to policy steps beneficial to the firm under the U.S. Biden administration, its chief financial officer said on Tuesday. The firm suspended operations across Cuba in November as new United States sanctions kicked in, cutting a key lifeline for many Cuban families at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic has worsened the Communist-run island’s economic crisis. U.S. President-elect Joe Biden has promised to roll back some sanctions on remittances, although in a move that could complicate any efforts by Biden to revive ties with Havana, the Trump administration last week announced it was returning Cuba to the U.S. list of state sponsors of terrorism. “We’re hopeful that, putting aside any concerns that there may be from the administration standpoint, that they allow us to move the money for people who want to move money to their loved ones,” Raj Agrawal told Reuters. Western Union, which on Tuesday announced an agreement that will offer its money transfer services at more than 4,700 Walmart stores across the United States, expects a further boost from Biden’s plans to deliver 100 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine within the first 100 days of his presidency, said Agrawal. “It’s going to be good for the country to just have a new administration in place, just to bring some stability to the overall environment, I think that’s the main benefit we’re getting here, and just to bring some professionalism to the things that need to be done, including getting rid of the virus,” he said. “We’re hopeful that some of the policies and things that they’ve talked about come into play because those things may be beneficial to Western Union.” Western Union, which has a network of more than 550,000 retail agents in more than 200 countries and territories, expects an improved outlook for 2021 as the global economy revives from the pandemic and on expectations for additional U.S. government stimulus. The firm’s agreement with Walmart, the world’s largest retailer, which pushed Western Union’s shares up 2.6% on Tuesday, will involve a rollout of the services to begin in the spring of 2021, the companies said Tuesday."
7.107466110645539," In blow to struggling Cubans, Western Union offices close as sanctions bite HAVANA (Reuters) - Western Union Co suspended its operations across Cuba on Monday evening as new U.S. sanctions kicked in, cutting a key lifeline for many struggling Cuban families as the coronavirus pandemic deepens the Communist-run island’s economic crisis. U.S. President-elect Joe Biden has promised to roll back some sanctions on remittances. But any lifting of the suspension could take time and until then, Cuban Americans are expected to resort to alternatives that are more costly, less secure and less rapid. Remittances to Cuba are believed to be around $2 billion to $3 billion annually, representing its third biggest source of dollars after the services industry and tourism. Money transfers from the United States via Western Union were estimated at more than $1 billion last year, the majority of which was sent from Florida, according to John Kavulich, president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council. Current options for remittances include agencies that hire “mules” to fly out to Cuba with cash and which predate Western Union’s start in Cuba 20 years ago, as well as companies that transfer dollars to Cuban accounts - though that money can only be used at state stores. Cryptocurrency exchanges are also promoting themselves as an alternative. Cuban Americans can transfer digital currencies to middle men on the island who then give money to the Cuban Americans’ relatives. But such platforms lack oversight, cryptocurrencies can fluctuate rapidly and unexpectedly in value and internet access is still not a given in Cuba, Kavulich said. “We’ve looked but there are no safe services,” said local resident Arturo Labaut. The closures of Western Union’s 407 offices in Cuba came into effect after U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration banned U.S. firms sending remittances via military-controlled companies that include Western Union’s main Cuban partner. His administration has also previously capped the amount Cuban Americans can send family members at $1,000 per quarter, and transfers of money to non-family members are no longer allowed. The new ban comes just as Cuba has started enacting structural reforms to revive its state-run economy which have been long called for but which will spell pain for its residents in the meantime. “It’s a bad time to be doing this because of the suffering it will cause,” said Florida International University professor Guillermo Grenier. “It’s not governments that suffer, it’s people.”"

STC said on Saturday that Western Union, the world’s largest money transfer company, has acquired a 15% stake in stc pay for $200 million, valuing the business at $1.3 billion. “It is - God willing - next year, but is subject to their regulatory approvals,” Ahmed Alenazi said of the planned expansion into the UAE, Kuwait and Bahrain. He said that Egypt was also being discussed, though the Gulf nations were the immediate target. Asked about other markets, such as India, Pakistan and the Philippines, Alenazi said sthat tc pay would “follow the money”. “We have to add value to the ecosystem. We are not looking just to be a regular player that comes with the same approach. We are looking to be innovative,” he said, declining to detail the approach. Alenazi declined to comment on the company’s financials or growth, only saying that growth has been “massive” and that stc pay has 4.5 million active users, with 500,000 people logging into to the application every day. Stc pay is the first fintech company licensed by the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority, the Saudi central bank. Alenazi said the business is also hoping to become the kingdom’s first licensed digital bank, allowing it to offer additional services such as lending. Alenazi declined to say whether stc pay plans to go public at some point in the future, saying that would be up to its shareholders."

11.42606317599844," Western Union expects better 2021 after COVID-19 hit, says CFO LONDON (Reuters) - Western Union Co WU.N, the world's largest money transfer firm, expects an improved outlook for 2021 as people adjust to the novel coronavirus and on expectations for additional U.S. government stimulus to help the economy, its chief financial officer said on Tuesday. Remittance flows, a vital source of external financing for developing countries, have tumbled this year as new migration has slowed and some existing migrant workers return to their home countries after losing jobs. Western Union, which relies on such transfers for its business, last week reported third-quarter revenue of $1.3 billion compared to a Refinitiv IBES estimate of $1.25 billion and reinstated its 2020 full-year financial outlook with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) earnings per share in the range of $1.72-$1.77. “Generally, I would expect a better 2021 than we saw this year,” Raj Agrawal told Reuters in a video interview. “At least here in the U.S., we should get some economic stimulus. The election will be behind us, all of these things will help the U.S., which is a big part of our business, and I do think people have learned to live a little bit more with the pandemic and we will see better times next year.” The World Bank expects remittance flows to fall by 7% to $666 billion in 2020, before a further decline of 7.1% in 2021. The World Bank’s estimated contraction for 2020 was less severe than the almost 20% dip it had forecast in April. While an easing of COVID-19-related lockdowns helped a recovery in Western Union’s retail business in the third quarter, the firm has also been boosted by faster-than-expected growth in its digital business, which includes money sent via the internet, mobile or its digital partners. In the last two quarters, Western Union’s digital business had been growing in the 40%-50% range, said Agrawal, adding that digital revenues accounted for around 21% of its total consumer revenue, with the remaining 79% driven by retail."
-0.30137699163238446," U.S. bans business with Fincimex unit American International Services WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department said on Monday it was adding American International Services, a unit of Fincimex, to the Cuba Restricted List, saying the Cuban military uses it to charge fees and manipulate the remittance and foreign currency market. Military-owned Fincimex is the main Cuban partner of foreign credit card companies and money transfer firm Western Union WU.N, which Cubans in the United States have used for two decades to send money back to their loved ones on the Caribbean island. “We urge anyone who sends remittances to family in Cuba to use means other than Cuban government-controlled remittance entities,” U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a statement. Since President Donald Trump took office in January 2017, he has been rolling back a detente with America’s old Cold War foe pursued by his Democratic predecessor, President Barack Obama. Trump earlier this month banned U.S. citizens from bringing home rum or cigars from Cuba and from staying at Cuban government-owned hotels. Trump’s aides believe his toughened stance has gone down well in the large Cuban-American community in South Florida, an important voting bloc in a state where he and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden are locked in a tight race."

-1.0109897074139385," On Raul Castro's birthday, U.S. threatens Cuba remittances WASHINGTON/HAVANA (Reuters) - The Trump administration expanded on Wednesday its list of Cuban entities that Americans are banned from doing business with to include the financial corporation that handles U.S. remittances to the Communist-run country. Military-owned Fincimex is the main Cuban partner of foreign credit card companies and money transfer firm Western Union, which Cubans in the United States have used for two decades to send money back to their loved ones on the Caribbean island. Those remittances are all the more needed now as the coronavirus pandemic is worsening Cuba’s already grim economic outlook, grinding the key tourism industry to a halt. A U.S. State Department spokesman said the move was designed to stop the flow of remittances through military-controlled financial institutions and the flow of hard currency to the government. The Trump administration was challenging Cuba to identify another company not affiliated to its military that U.S. financial companies could work with, or to create one, said John Kavulich, president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council. “If Cuba refuses, the Trump administration is prepared to cease remittances,” he said. He noted a senior official had quipped to him that the sanction was “a birthday present to Raul Castro,” the leader of the Cuban Communist Party, who turned 89 on Tuesday. New regulations implementing the sanction will be closely watched. There is the possibility existing U.S. business with Fincimex could be grandfathered in. A Western Union spokeswoman said the company was looking into the measure but could not immediately comment. “The U.S. government continues to act as a rogue state,” the general director for U.S. affairs of Cuba’s Foreign Ministry, Carlos Fernandez de Cossio, said on Twitter. The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump says it is tightening the decades-old trade embargo on Cuba, unraveling the 2014-16 detente of his predecessor Barack Obama, to pressure the government to carry out democratic reform. In private, officials say they see this tough approach to Cuba as a means of currying favor with the large Cuban-American community in south Florida, a state considered vital to Trump’s re-election chances in November. But this action could backfire, say analysts, as it will so openly hurt the relatives of Cuban-Americans, ordinary Cubans, more than the Communist government. “It is lamentable and counterproductive for U.S. sanctions to also include remittances,” said Pavel Vidal, a former Cuban central bank economist who teaches at Colombia’s Universidad Javeriana Cali. Cubans could in normal times at least rely on money brought into the country in person but the government suspended air travel in March in a bid to curb the spread of the coronavirus."

America’s newest financial regulator wants the country’s mayors and governors to end Covid-19 lockdowns, and is using banks as a reason. On Monday, his second day as acting comptroller of the currency, Brian Brooks wrote a letter outlining the risk to financial stability. Brooks’ concerns are old-school: bank robberies. Compulsory mask-wearing might encourage heists, he worries. While he doesn’t directly mention current unrest, he frets that buildings that banks lend against could be looted or vandalized. Brooks also worries cities’ “initiatives” to cut off utilities to lockdown-breakers could impact loan values. It’s not a surprise that Brooks supports the White House philosophy on re-opening. Like predecessor Joseph Otting, he was a top executive at OneWest Bank, the bank U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin formerly co-owned. But it’s odd that his letter offers no evidence that lockdowns and masks cause crime. Brooks also argued banks need “sound data.” So do regulators. (By Antony Currie) SCREENS ARE BETTER.

The U.S. coal industry was already in the grip of a decades-long decline thanks to the rise of oil, then natural gas and, more recently, renewable energy. Last year the sedimentary rock powered some 23% of U.S. electricity needs, according to the Energy Information Administration, 13% lower than 2018 and just half of its 2010 level. Several operators went bankrupt, including Trump backer Robert Murray’s eponymous energy firm. The coronavirus is accelerating the burn. Industry EBITDA could halve this year, Moody’s Investors Service reckons, as lockdowns reduce the demand for both thermal coal in electricity production and metallurgical coal for steelmaking. Environmental and business concerns have prompted many banks and investors to financially distance themselves. That’s good for air and water quality. But it’s bad for the industry’s 44,000 workers, and a president who in 2018 lauded coal as “indestructible stuff.” (By Antony Currie) MINNOW MONEY. The People’s Bank of China is preparing to buy loans made directly to small firms by commercial banks to the tune of 400 billion yuan ($56.2 billion) per quarter. The aim is to inject around 1 trillion yuan into struggling private companies that ordinarily represent big risks to bank balance sheets, and which are also responsible for a majority of the country’s jobs. They have been hit hard by Covid-19, but this move reinforces suspicions that loan officers have been reluctant to fund these businesses, despite relentless pressure from the central government. The rub is that anyone using the facility will need to pay it back in a year. The central bank also will not bear the risk if loans sour. This conservatism might sabotage the goal; China is unlikely to leap back to health so quickly, which means the money will go to smaller state-owned enterprises – or nowhere at all.

Shares in the German carrier climbed as much as 8% on Tuesday, the first trading day after the European Commission watered down demands for it to surrender 72 take-off and landing openings in return for approval of a 9 billion euro state rescue. Instead, Lufthansa will only lose 24 slots at the Munich and Frankfurt hubs where it accounts for two-thirds of flights. What looks like a mini-victory for Chief Executive Carsten Spohr is not necessarily a setback for European Union antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager. She was never going to get her opening gambit, but at least now has some measure of how much a slot might be worth. Based on the 350 million euros added to Lufthansa’s market capitalisation, the 48 slots it is keeping come out at 7 million euros a pop. (By Ed Cropley) PARTING GIFTS. Tesco’s clear-out of executives may come with a sting. Although the 22 billion pound grocer has enjoyed record sales during the coronavirus pandemic, its finance chief, Alan Stewart, is following in the footsteps of Chief Executive Dave Lewis, who will step down at the end of September. The duo deserve credit for steadying the ship after an accounting scandal in 2014. But a brewing pay row may sour relations with investors. Tesco is stripping out online retailer Ocado from its peer group when calculating bonuses. The result will see Stewart pocket nearly 1 million pounds on top of his 750,000 pound salary and pension perks. Tesco’s defence is that Ocado, which also sells warehouse technology, is not really a grocer and is skewing the benchmark. This would be an easier argument to make if Ocado hadn’t also experienced a grocery boom since lockdown began. Investors will get a chance to have their say at the annual shareholder meeting on June 26. Tesco bosses may find their leaving presents are handed out reluctantly. (By Aimee Donnellan)"

The firm generated revenue of $1.2 billion in the first quarter, a fall of 11% compared with the prior-year period, on a reported basis. “We saw improved trends in the month of April and given the various forecasts for economic growth and GDP, we think the second quarter will be the lowest quarter for us during the course of this year from a revenue and profit margins standpoint and hopefully it will improve after we get through the second quarter,” Raj Agrawal told Reuters. The firm, which has operations in more than 200 countries, in March withdrew its full-year financial outlook amid the coronavirus pandemic. Agrawal said the firm was not reinstating its 2020 outlook as the environment remains uncertain. With many parts of the world in lockdown to help control the spread of the coronavirus and large swathes of the labour market out of work, the amount of money sent home by migrant workers this year is expected to fall.

Started 11 years ago as a basic service to transfer money via mobile phone to cater for Kenyans without access to the formal banking network, M-Pesa has evolved into a fully-fledged financial service, offering loans and savings in conjunction with local banks, as well as merchant payments services. It has also powered Safaricom’s earnings growth in recent years, with revenue from the service growing at 18 percent in the half year to the end of September to 35.52 billion shillings ($349.43 million), nearly a third of the total. The new service will allow M-Pesa’s 21 million active users to send and receive money across the world using their mobile phones which will be connected to Western Union’s half a million agents. “M-PESA Global seeks to connect Kenyans to opportunities by making it easy and seamless for them to transact with the world and for the world to transact with Kenyans,” said Sitoyo Lopokoiyit, Chief Financial Services Officer at Safaricom. Western Union Global Money Transfer President Odilon Almeida said the integration of the two platforms would allow users to send and receive money to and from more than 200 countries and territories. “It will become a model for opening a world of global connectivity and economic opportunity for emerging as well as developed economies,” Almeida said. Eric Musau, an analyst who covers Safaricom at Standard Investment Bank, said M-Pesa Global would help the company get a share of the funds sent home by Kenyans living abroad, which have been averaging $200 million a month in the past few months. “It will help them tap into an existing market, which is a significant market so this is a positive,” Musau said. Users will also be able to send money to bank accounts in the United Arab Emirates, Germany and Britain immediately with more countries being added in the coming weeks, Safaricom said.
