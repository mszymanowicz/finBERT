2.9211740283588514," Bosnia begins COVID-19 vaccination roll-out with Russian vaccine SARAJEVO Feb 12 (Reuters) - Bosnian health workers received their first COVID-19 vaccine shots on Friday and officials in the country’s autonomous Serb Republic announced a mass inoculation drive for later this month. Bosnia had not received any vaccines until last week, when its first batch of Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine arrived, enabling it to start inoculating medical staff working in COVID-19 hospitals and departments in its Serb-dominated region. In January, the Balkan country announced plans to order Russian and Chinese-made vaccines, fearing deliveries ordered under the COVAX scheme for poor countries and from the European Union would be too little too late. Bosnia, which also comprises the Bosniak-Croat Federation that has not received any vaccines yet, has ordered 1.2 million vaccine doses under the COVAX scheme and nearly 900,000 from the EU. Officials hope the first doses will arrive later this month. “We expect that Republika Srpska will receive the first quantity of vaccines for 100,000 people in the second half of February, and kick off a mass inoculation with the Russian vaccine,” Serb Republic Health Minister Alen Seranic said in the region’s main city of Banja Luka. The region has ordered 400,000 doses of the Sputnik V vaccine and Serbia has donated vaccines for 5,000 Bosnian Serb medical staff who will be inoculated in Serbia, he said. As of Thursday, Bosnia had recorded 125,123 cases of the new coronavirus and 4,868 deaths. In the Western Balkans region, inoculations have begun only in Serbia, which ordered the Pfizer/BioNTech , Sputnik V and Sinopharm vaccines. Serbia has also announced it could have the capacity to manufacture Sputnik V domestically by the end of the year.. Montenegro, North Macedonia and Kosovo have not received any vaccines yet. Albania has received some. In Montenegro, municipalities along the Adriatic coast have been hit hard by COVID-19, with 118 new cases alone in the coastal town of Budva. It has reported 66,857 coronavirus cases and 861 deaths. (Reporting by Daria Sito-Sucic, with additional reporting by Aleksandar Vasovic in Belgrade; Editing by Timothy Heritage)"
6.136215573392543," Bosnia to order Russian, Chinese vaccines ahead of COVAX, EU deliveries SARAJEVO (Reuters) - Bosnia plans to order Russian and Chinese-made coronavirus vaccines fearing that deliveries ordered under the COVAX scheme for poor countries and from the European Union will be too little too late, officials said on Thursday. Inoculations in the Western Balkans have begun in Serbia, which has directly ordered Pfizer/BioNTech, Russian Sputnik V and Chinese Sinopharm vaccines. But Bosnia, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Kosovo have not received any vaccines as yet. Albania has received some. Bosnia has ordered 1.2 million vaccines under the COVAX scheme and nearly 900,000 vaccines from the EU for its two autonomous regions, the Bosniak-Croat Federation and the Serb Republic, and expects the first batch to arrive soon, Prime Minister Zoran Tegeltija said. Bosna applied for EU membership in 2016. The COVAX scheme, led by the World Health Organization and GAVI vaccine alliance, is due to start rolling out vaccines to poor and middle-income countries in February, with 2 of 3 billion doses expected to be delivered this year. But it has so far struggled to secure enough shots due to a shortage of funds, while wealthy nations have booked large volumes of vaccines for themselves. Europe has also suffered delays in deliveries from Pfizer. Bosnia’s central government, over which Tegeltija presides, does not have the authority to order vaccines directly from producers. The two regions also can only make orders through authorised agencies. Under strong public pressure, the two otherwise rival regions and the central government agreed on Thursday to work together to order directly from Pfizer and the Russian and Chinese producers, Tegeltija told a news conference. “Bearing in mind the delays in deliveries, we have decided to start this very complicated procurement system,” he said. Bosnia, with a population of about 3.5 million, on Thursday recorded a total of 119,206 coronavirus infections, with 18,123 active cases and 4,536 deaths."
11.449716633594603," We may soon have a COVID-19 vaccine. But will enough people take it? ZURICH/LONDON (Reuters) - With COVID-19 vaccine trial results looking positive, governments and pharmaceutical firms face their next daunting challenge: convincing the world to get inoculated. Public resistance to vaccines has been much discussed this year, but the issue became very real on Monday when Pfizer and BioNTech announced their candidate was more than 90% effective in large trials - hoisting an actual shot onto the horizon. Numerous opinion polls carried out before and during the pandemic showed confidence is volatile, and that political polarization and online misinformation threatens uptake. Many people have concerns about the accelerated speed of COVID-19 vaccine development. The World Health Organization estimates about 70% of people must be inoculated to break transmission of the virus. Since it is unlikely a vaccine, once approved, will be immediately available for the masses, experts said getting medical workers on board will be critical. “We should have really targeted discussions and engagement with healthcare providers,” Heidi Larson, director of the global Vaccine Confidence Project, told Reuters. “Not only are they going to be the first ones expected to get a vaccine - if not required to - they’re also going to be the ones on the frontlines facing the onslaught of questions from the public.” While about 200 COVID-19 vaccine candidates are in development globally, with dozens in human clinical trials, no shot has actually crossed the finish line and been approved, though the one from Pfizer-BioNTech appears to be on track. The high rate of efficacy in the Pfizer-BioNTech interim results could help boost confidence, Cornell University government Professors Douglas Kriner and Sarah Kreps said. Their recently published research showed that if an initial COVID-19 vaccine was about as effective as a flu shot, uptake by the American public may fall far short of the 70% level needed to achieve “herd immunity”. “However, if the vaccine was 90% effective it would significantly increase Americans’ willingness to vaccinate by more than 10%, critical to ensuring enough public acceptance to help the U.S. eventually get closer to herd immunity,” said Kreps. Experts are also cautioning any conversation over a vaccine’s risks and rewards must be frank. A return to normal life will still take time, with no one shot likely to be a silver bullet. And many questions are likely to remain, including how long a vaccine will provide protection. The Reagan-Udall Foundation for the FDA, a non-profit that supports the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, has been holding focus groups to gauge the public mood and is now crafting campaign messages to help tackle concerns. Its chief executive, Susan Winckler, said more than a dozen focus groups of 150 people in total held since August - some in person, some by video - had unearthed numerous concerns. “We heard distrust of both government and the healthcare system,” Winckler said. “Many didn’t want to be first in line for the shot.” It’s a global phenomenon; a survey from early November, carried out by the World Economic Forum and covering 18,526 people in 15 countries, showed 73% of people willing to get a COVID-19 vaccine, a four-point fall since August. Regulators and the drug industry have taken pains to reassure the public they won’t cut corners on safety, with a top U.S. drug agency official saying he would quit if an unproven vaccine were rubber stamped. The International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations, a drug industry group, also plans a campaign by 2021, while the U.S. Council for International Business, with 300 multinational corporations as members, is also getting behind a campaign pushing for workforce take-up of eventual COVID-19 vaccines. Some studies show government and employer recommendations will help convince people to get vaccinated. Scott Ratzan, co-leader with Larson of ‘CONVINCE’, an initiative supporting communication and engagement for vaccine uptake globally, stressed the importance of medical workers getting inoculated, saying others would then be more likely to follow suit. “If we don’t have the medical folks signed on ... we’ll lose the early battle,” he added. “The only way to get back to normal is if we can get enough workers or employees covered.”"
-7.757683523771858," Conagra results fall just short, shares down 6 percent (Reuters) - Sales at Conagra Brands Inc CAG.N fell short of Wall Street estimates on Thursday as the packaged food company sold fewer products at full-price to restaurants and caterers, weakening profit and sending the company's shares lower. The company also said its second-quarter advertising and promotion costs would be higher than the first quarter. The sales miss and cost warning pushed the company's shares down as much as 7 percent and weighed on the stocks of rivals such as Kellogg K.N and J.M. Smucker SJN.N. Conagra has been investing on marketing its products in the face of intense competition among packaged food makers and the shifting taste of the health-conscious consumer. “We need to be in-store and online ... and this takes investment,” Chief Executive Officer Sean Connolly said. “It’s about getting noticed.” The company’s net sales in the first quarter rose 1.7 percent to $1.83 billion, but were below the average analysts’ estimate of $1.85 billion, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Sales at the food service business that delivers products such as sauces and beef cuts to caterers and restaurant chains fell 6.9 percent to $234 million in the quarter, compared to estimates of $246 million. However, its larger refrigerated foods business continued to be the bright spot with sale rising 3.2 percent. The company has been looking to bulk up in the fast-growing frozen meal business and recently announced the acquisition of Pinnacle Foods Inc PFN.N for $8.1 billion. That deal would catapult it much closer in size to rival Nestle NESN.S and give it much needed scale and negotiating power to deal with stiff competition. Overall, net income attributable to the company rose 17 percent to $178.2 million in the first quarter ended Aug. 26. Excluding items, the company earned 47 cents per share, missing estimates of 49 cents per share. The company’s shares fell 6 percent to $33.76 in afternoon trading."
