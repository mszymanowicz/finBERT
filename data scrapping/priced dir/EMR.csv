-4.388617693876829," Emerson CEO sees China coronavirus situation stabilizing March 4 (Reuters) - Emerson Electric Co. said it expects sales at its vast China operations to take a painful hit in the first quarter as a result of the coronavirus, but that about half of that lost business will be made up later in the year as China scrambles to stimulate its economy, which will fuel demand for Emerson’s industrial equipment. “At this point we’re running all our (China) facilities full out,” Emerson CEO David Farr told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday. The improvements in China come as anxiety is rising in other parts of the world, including the United States, where the Federal Reserve on Tuesday slashed its benchmark overnight interest rate by a half percentage point to a target range of 1.00% to 1.25%. It was the first emergency rate cut since 2008, amid the financial crisis. Farr said about 90 percent of Emerson’s 11,000 Chinese workers are back on the job, working through backlogged orders as the larger business climate in China remains stalled. Emerson, based in St. Louis, is projecting economic disruptions in that country will shave $75 million to $100 million off its China sales in the first quarter. The company’s China sales are about $2 billion a year. Farr said the situation on the ground in China’s industrial heartland appears to have stabilized, with more goods moving and fewer barriers, such as checkpoints on highways that have slowed recovery up to now. One key metric Farr tracks, updated twice a day in a larger report Farr receives from China, is that 95 percent of the company’s suppliers are back online, running at about 75 percent of capacity. The problems in China haven’t hobbled Emerson’s operations in other parts of the world, a common problem for many global producers, largely because the company locked up large blocks of air-freight capacity at the beginning of February, said Farr. “I’m paying a premium for this, but we knew there was going to be a huge bottleneck,” said Farr, adding that the question now is whether Emerson extends its air-freight plans to the end of April. Reopening factories in China has been a daunting process. Getting approvals to reopen often required multiple government inspections and navigating an array of rules aimed at curbing the spread of disease. In some areas, for instance, Farr said authorities required all conference rooms inside Emerson factories to be taped shut—to assure no gatherings of larger groups of people in those locations.

-29.040189014584772," Emerson says will not pursue a break-up following internal review (Reuters) - Emerson Electric Co EMR.N told investors on Thursday it would not pursue a break-up following a review it launched last year into whether to separate its industrial automation operations from its air-conditioning business. Breaking up Emerson was one of the demands made by hedge fund D.E. Shaw & Co LP last October, when it announced it owned more than 1% of the company. Emerson unveiled some corporate governance changes in November that won D.E. Shaw’s endorsement and avoided a challenge to its board. A spokesman for D.E. Shaw declined to comment on Thursday on whether the hedge fund remains an Emerson shareholder and what its reaction to the company’s announcement was. Emerson, which pursued an unsuccessful $29 billion acquisition bid for peer Rockwell Automation Inc ROK.N in 2017, had long been seen as a potential break-up candidate among investors and analysts. Its automation solutions business serves mostly industrial clients, while its climate technology business caters primarily to commercial and residential markets. Emerson said in a presentation to investors it will not break up “unless a major strategic acquisition catalyst is actioned.” The St. Louis-based company also said that it had earmarked $4 billion for acquisitions. “We are a multi-business company, no different than a Honeywell or any of these other companies. There are very few pure, pure plays out there,” Emerson Chief Executive Officer David Farr said in an interview with Reuters. “It doesn’t mean we won’t sell certain things off, because we will. But the way it is right now, (the board) firmly believes that we create value with these platforms,” Farr added. Through a series of cost cuts and operational changes, Emerson said it aimed to reach 44% gross margin by 2023 from 42.5% in 2019, and $4 billion in operating cash flow by 2023 from $3 billion in 2019. D.E. Shaw had argued that cost cuts, in conjunction with a break-up, could add more than $20 billion in equity value to the company. D.E.

4.653145737683446," Fly Emerson Air: How a U.S. company deploys its seven corporate jets BOSTON (Reuters) - As Tiger Woods staged his dramatic comeback at Augusta National Golf Club earlier this year, most of Emerson Electric Co's EMR.N fleet of luxury corporate jets swooped in. Its planes arrived at Georgia’s Augusta Regional Airport from all over the United States, flying in from Austin, Dallas, Houston, New Orleans, New York and the industrial conglomerate’s hometown of St. Louis, according to U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) records. By the time Woods sealed his fifth Masters victory on April 14, Emerson pilots had landed 13 times at the airport during the four-day tournament. Emerson, which is in the vital but unglamorous business of making products such as measurement and control systems used by manufacturing companies, is now taking heat over its ownership of eight aircraft. The fleet consists of seven jets and one helicopter, according to St. Louis County Assessor records. Hedge fund D.E. Shaw, which owns more than 1% of the company, earlier this month wrote to Emerson’s board and spotlighted the “great expense to shareholders” of its corporate jets, seeing them as emblematic of a “bloated structure and expense base.” The fund is agitating for big changes at Emerson, including splitting it in two, and is seeking support from other shareholders. Its case is that Emerson’s stock has lagged badly, partly because of elevated costs. Its shares rose 12% in the past five years, a period in which the S&P 500 gained 53%. In the three fiscal years ending in 2016 to 2018, Emerson’s selling, general and administrative expenses surged 23% but its net sales rose only 20%. Soon after D.E. Shaw’s campaign became public in a Reuters story on Sept. 27, Emerson announced a review of its operations. Aviation costs will be part of that. The company, which employed 87,500 people in 2018, declined to answer Reuters’ questions about its aircraft. A spokeswoman declined to say who was ferried to Augusta and other destinations, and whether people were being taken to the tournament or were traveling for some other reason. Emerson has a South Carolina facility near Augusta. The size of the fleet and the number of times Emerson’s Chief Executive David Farr uses the planes for personal trips is out of step with most major U.S. companies. Some others have sold their jets, and those retaining them have smaller fleets than Emerson, National Business Aviation Association data show. A Reuters analysis of FAA records shows that Emerson’s planes have made 260 flights in the past 90 days. This month alone, the jets were tracked in Alaska, California, China and New York. There also have been recent trips to Boston, Minneapolis, New Delhi, Japan and Washington, D.C. The intensity of the flying, and other details about how Emerson’s aviation arm operates, have not been previously reported. The information is gathered from flight and local authority records as well as from interviews with former staff at the operation. Certainly Emerson executives do need to travel as the company has more than 200 manufacturing sites and more than half its sales are abroad, but it is the way they do it that has sparked questions among investors. In its annual proxy statement, Emerson says it requires Farr to use the company’s aircraft for all his travel, including personal trips, “to promote business efficiency and safety.” This reasoning is challenged by corporate governance expert Jonathan Macey, a Yale Law School professor. Given tight security at most airports that argument “is just balderdash,” he said. Private aviation business experts counter that security is an issue not just for the executive but for the things they may be working on or discussing while traveling. On a private plane “they don’t have to worry about anyone listening in on their business dealings,” said SherpaReport’s Nick Copley, who analyses the private aviation industry. Luxury jet flying can be a family affair for the CEO. Photographs posted on the Facebook page of his son Andrew in August 2007 show Farr flying with a small brown dog on his lap. His son and a handful of his son’s friends, teenagers at the time, are pictured sitting in a jet’s plush chairs eating pastries. In the fiscal year to September 2018, Emerson estimated Farr’s personal jet travel cost it $369,000, according to a filing. It said he reimburses the company for personal trips based on first-class ticket prices, but Emerson does not disclose how much he pays. The cost was higher than for CEOs at many other manufacturing companies. Michael Roman, the CEO of 3M Co MMM.N, whose sales are almost double Emerson's, cost his company $56,743 in personal aircraft use last year. The fanciest jet in Emerson’s fleet is a 2013 Dassault Falcon 7X, which it bought last year for an undisclosed sum. The price tag for the plane, which seats up to 16 and can be equipped with an on-board shower, would be between $25 million and $30 million, according to SherpaReport.com. Emerson employs enough staff to run a small airline, including pilots, schedulers, hangar security, and at least one summer intern, according to former employees and LinkedIn pages of current employees. Annual costs for operating the fleet are estimated to be $20 million to $25 million, according to Liberty Jet Management’s expense calculator. That excludes costs of buying the planes. The Augusta trips alone would likely have cost $120,000, Copley estimates. Expenses include $61,122 Emerson paid in real estate taxes for its hangar, and property taxes of $112,000 for the jets, local tax records show. Both Emerson’s St. Louis headquarters and its corporate retreat some 40 miles (64 km) away in Winfield, Missouri, have helipads. Photographs posted by Emerson pilots on Facebook show the company’s Bell 412 helicopter, identifiable by its tail number, at Winfield. The retreat has a conference center, a tennis court and swimming pool on more than 400 acres, according to the county assessor and real estate records. Emerson’s ties to Augusta, the exclusive golf club, date back to Farr’s predecessor, Charles Knight, who was one of only about 300 members. Farr is an avid golfer. He told Forbes in March he had “dragged everyone from my wife to friends and Emerson colleagues for a round,” in the United States, Ireland and Scotland. Neither Emerson nor the club would comment on whether he belongs to Augusta. The corporate jet’s heyday was in the 1980s when tobacco-to-food conglomerate RJR Nabisco had 10. The book “Barbarians at the Gate: The Fall Of RJR Nabisco” details how one jet was flown across the United States with the CEO’s dog as the key passenger. By 2008, at the height of the financial crisis, attitudes were very different. CEOs of U.S. auto companies were criticized by lawmakers for traveling by corporate jet when they were seeking a bailout from the government. Even St. Louis beer maker Anheuser-Busch, whose fleet once matched Emerson’s, now owns only one jet and one helicopter after the company was acquired by Belgium-based InBev. Charlie Horton, who worked at Emerson as a flight department maintenance supervisor more than 20 years ago, said Emerson and Anheuser once competed to see who had the best-looking fleet in St. Louis. “I’d have to say they are the best-maintained aircraft in aviation,” Horton said of the Emerson fleet. “It’s almost like a scheduled airline.”"
13.959101170950747," Hedge fund D.E. Shaw raises pressure on Emerson, calls for breakup (Reuters) - Hedge fund D.E. Shaw on Tuesday increased the pressure on Emerson Electric Co by publicly urging a breakup of the U.S. industrial conglomerate, a move it says could unlock more than $20 billion worth of shareholder value. The New York-based hedge fund, which owns a more than 1% stake in the Ferguson, Missouri-based company, wants it to split into a pure play industrial automation business and a climate technology-focused firm, D.E. Shaw wrote to the board. It also wants the company, which keeps a fleet of eight corporate jets and a helicopter, to cut costs and update its governance structure under which its directors are elected to three-year terms while the industry standard is for one-year terms. The hedge fund expressed concern that only one Emerson director out of 10 has bought stock with his own money in the last years, which could suggest that board members are not appropriately invested in the company’s performance, a person familiar with D.E. Shaw’s thinking said. The hedge fund also wants Emerson to change how it pays management. “To create maximum and enduring value for its shareholders, Emerson needs to change,” the letter said. “We believe the right set of actions could result in over 50% upside to Emerson’s share price,” it added. The company in a statement on Tuesday said it would look at what D.E. Shaw is suggesting. “We will carefully evaluate D.E. Shaw’s proposals as we continue to assess value-creation opportunities,” Emerson said. Emerson’s stock price climbed 1.5% on Tuesday, but it has lost 12.6% in the last year and has underperformed its peers by 45% over the past five years. D.E. Shaw has owned Emerson stock for years and has quietly spoken with management about ways to improve efficiencies. Emerson previously pledged to review its “operational, capital allocation and portfolio issues,” but the hedge fund wants to see more accountability and a quicker pace of change. “Put simply, creating two separate, leaner, more focused organizations would ensure that Emerson’s businesses remain forces to be reckoned with, far into the future,” the letter said. A spokesman for the hedge fund on Tuesday declined to comment beyond the letter. D.E. Shaw stopped short of calling for long-term Emerson Chief Executive David Farr to step down, something a number of activist hedge funds have requested in previous campaigns. Farr has suggested that he will likely retire in the next 18 months. The hedge fund wants fresh blood in the boardroom and could nominate its own director candidates before the Nov. 6 deadline, potentially adding to the pressure on the company to take action by giving other shareholders a way to express concerns. The letter comes more than two weeks after Reuters reported that D.E. Shaw was building a stake in the company and was planning to push for changes."

Shaw & Co is building a stake in Emerson Electric Co EMR.N and is planning to push for changes, including a potential split-up of the U.S. industrial conglomerate, people familiar with the matter said on Friday. Emerson, which pursued an unsuccessful $29 billion acquisition bid for peer Rockwell Automation Inc ROK.N two years ago, has long been seen as a potential break-up candidate among investors and analysts. Its automation solutions business serves mostly industrial clients, while its remaining divisions cater primarily to commercial and residential markets. D.E. Shaw is in the process of building a position in Emerson as it prepares to pressure the company to pursue a split and other changes, the sources said. The sources requested anonymity because the matter is confidential. D.E. Shaw and Emerson declined to comment. Emerson shares ended trading up 3.4% to $64.40 on the news, giving the company a market capitalization of $41 billion. Emerson, a diversified manufacturer with $17.4 billion in sales last year, provides dozens of industries with thousands of products, from tools and large industrial valves to refrigeration, lighting and climate control systems. Emerson’s strength is in process automation, helping power plants and factories in sectors such as mining and cement operate more efficiently. Its commercial and residential solutions businesses supplies products such as air conditioners and refrigeration systems. David Farr has served as the company’s CEO since 2000. Were Emerson to agree to break up, it would be the latest industrial conglomerate to do so under pressure from an activist shareholder. General Electric Co GE.N has shed many of its divisions following pressure from Trian Fund Management LP, while ThyssenKrupp AG TKAG.DE agreed to split into two separate companies after being targeted by Elliott Management Corp. D.E. Shaw has become more active as an activist shareholder in recent years, pursuing changes at companies such as oil and gas explorer EQT Corp EQT.N and grains trader Bunge Ltd BG.N.

-3.6642480720756536," As trade wars rage, Emerson plots new U.S. expansion Ferguson, Mo. (Reuters) - In 2009, the chief executive of Emerson Electric Co. bluntly told investors at a Chicago conference what many of his counterparts at other manufacturing firms would only say privately. “I’m not going to hire anybody in the United States. I’m moving,” David Farr said as he blasted U.S. taxes and regulations and called it an easy decision to expand in India and China. Farr’s flash of candor was emblematic of an era of free trade, globalization and offshoring of U.S. jobs – one that has now come under attack in the trade wars launched by U.S. President Donald Trump. A decade later, Farr has made a stunning reversal: Emerson now plans to build at least three new U.S. plants and is already expanding existing domestic operations. Farr saw a new era of U.S. protectionism coming before Trump’s election – and started planning accordingly, he said in an interview with Reuters at the company’s sprawling headquarters near St. Louis, Missouri. “For the first time now, I’m looking for best-cost U.S. locations” to build factories, he said. Trump’s election, Farr said, accelerated a political shift against free trade policy that is now transforming many U.S. firms’ domestic investment strategy. Protectionist policies — especially toward China — are now a rare point on which many Democrats and Trump agree, relegating formerly bold Republican free traders to the sidelines. Emerson has committed $250 million for new U.S. facilities through 2021, part of a larger domestic investment in existing operations, including a new headquarters and a factory renovation at its Wisconsin garbage-disposal business. Emerson spent $407 million on U.S. capital projects last year, a 38 percent jump from the year before, and plans to spend $425 million this year. Those investments have added 2,500 employees, Farr said. Emerson declined to say how many jobs the new factories would create. Emerson, a diversified manufacturer with $17.4 billion in sales last year, provides dozens of industries with thousands of products, from tools and large industrial valves to refrigeration, lighting and climate control systems. Its best-known consumer brand may be the InSinkErator garbage disposal. Farr’s new take on U.S. investment reflects a broader questioning of overseas expansions, especially in China, for both political and operational reasons. A survey of top managers at 500 U.S. companies conducted in December by investment bank UBS AG found that 31 percent have moved or are moving production facilities to avoid tariffs. Fifty-eight percent said they expect tariffs to “have a positive impact on domestic investment.” It remains unclear, however, whether and how much the trade policy upheaval will benefit U.S. workers. Many firms fleeing China to avoid U.S. tariffs are not moving to the United States, often choosing locations in Southeast Asia. Those that are expanding U.S. operations are trying to maximize automation to minimize labor costs, and some U.S. industries - such as consumers of steel - have said they plan to cut jobs because tariffs have raised their costs. The renewed domestic focus by Emerson, a major employer of high-skilled workers, nonetheless stands out as a victory for Trump’s protectionism. Emerson has been a poster child for globalization, and its CEO is among the nation’s most influential manufacturing executives. Farr just completed a two-year term as chairman of the National Association of Manufacturers, the sector’s main lobbying organization. Emerson once had an overwhelming U.S. and European focus. But that changed as it joined the stampede of manufacturers moving to emerging markets. When Farr became CEO in 2000, 8 percent of Emerson’s sales were in Asia. Last year, that hit 22 percent, and Emerson now has 26,000 employees in the region, slightly more than in the U.S. and Canada. Most of the company’s 215 factories sprinkled around the globe are now outside the U.S. But one of Farr’s first moves after Trump’s election was to assign a task force of top managers to adapt the firm’s investment plans to a less certain trade environment. The group has produced a top-ten list of potential U.S. locations for new plants. Free trade deals once had almost universal support among Republicans and broad support among Democrats. Farr noted that it was Democratic President Barack Obama who negotiated the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton once called the “gold standard” of trade agreements. But Clinton turned against the deal during the campaign as Trump’s attacks on trade deals drew applause across the industrial Midwest. Trump withdrew the United States from the sweeping Pacific accord immediately after his election, and many Republican free-traders have since gone silent on the issue or adopted variations of the president’s rhetoric. “You have a growing number in the Republican party aligned with what the President calls ‘America first’ – what others call isolationism,” said Andrew Downs, director of the Mike Downs Center for Indiana Politics at Purdue University Fort Wayne. The tax reform passed by Republicans has also made the U.S. a better place to invest by slashing taxes on businesses, Farr said, saving Emerson $189 million last year. The tax cuts enabled Emerson to grant a 2.9 percent general wage increase worth $42 million and better benefits. Some decisions remain in flux as trade disputes simmer. Emerson had long planned a new factory in Mexico to serve North America, but broke construction into two phases pending the outcome of a revised U.S. trade agreement with Canada and Mexico that awaits congressional approval. The first phase is underway, but the second will only be built if the trade deal goes forward. Forces beyond politics are pushing manufacturers like Emerson to reconsider investments in China, including rising labor and logistics costs there; worries about transferring intellectual property to state-run Chinese firms; and emerging technology to automate factories in high-wage countries. Farr said his meetings with candidate Trump during the campaign convinced him he was serious about overhauling U.S. trade relationships. But Emerson’s renewed commitment to U.S. manufacturing is also part of a larger move by global manufacturers to produce more goods in the regions where they are consumed to save on transportation costs. Foreign companies are also recalibrating, including Dutch multinational Koninklijke Philips NV, one of the world’s largest electronics companies, which last year relied on the United States for 35 percent of its sales. CEO Frans van Houten told investors on a call in January that he is stepping up efforts — like Emerson — to produce more goods where they sell them, moving away from a model of factories specializing in products that are then shipped globally. The push is visible in trade data, said Susan Lund, a partner at McKinsey & Company who studies trade flows. In 2007, 28 percent of global production of goods was traded — moving from one country to another. That share has dropped to 22.5 percent. Emerson’s industrial valve and controls business is one area where Farr plans to move factory capacity to the United States to serve customers there. Emerson produces valves used in everything from fracking to oil refineries and has sprawling research and production facilities in Marshalltown, Iowa, which this fiscal year will receive a $22 million capital investment and three dozen new jobs. U.S. valve factories produced only about half the goods it sold domestically in 2017. Emerson plans to push that to 90 percent by 2021. “We’re looking at two new facilities in Texas,” Farr said. “That will mean taking capacity, and jobs - out of Europe and some out of China - and bringing it to Texas.”"
-3.6642480720756536," RPT-INSIGHT-As trade wars rage, Emerson plots new US expansion (Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text) Ferguson, Mo., March 8 (Reuters) - In 2009, the chief executive of Emerson Electric Co. bluntly told investors at a Chicago conference what many of his counterparts at other manufacturing firms would only say privately. “I’m not going to hire anybody in the United States. I’m moving,” David Farr said as he blasted U.S. taxes and regulations and called it an easy decision to expand in India and China. Farr’s flash of candor was emblematic of an era of free trade, globalization and offshoring of U.S. jobs – one that has now come under attack in the trade wars launched by U.S. President Donald Trump. A decade later, Farr has made a stunning reversal: Emerson now plans to build at least three new U.S. plants and is already expanding existing domestic operations. Farr saw a new era of U.S. protectionism coming before Trump’s election – and started planning accordingly, he said in an interview with Reuters at the company’s sprawling headquarters near St. Louis, Missouri. “For the first time now, I’m looking for best-cost U.S. locations” to build factories, he said. Trump’s election, Farr said, accelerated a political shift against free trade policy that is now transforming many U.S. firms’ domestic investment strategy. Protectionist policies — especially toward China — are now a rare point on which many Democrats and Trump agree, relegating formerly bold Republican free traders to the sidelines. Emerson has committed $250 million for new U.S. facilities through 2021, part of a larger domestic investment in existing operations, including a new headquarters and a factory renovation at its Wisconsin garbage-disposal business. Emerson spent $407 million on U.S. capital projects last year, a 38 percent jump from the year before, and plans to spend $425 million this year. Those investments have added 2,500 employees, Farr said. Emerson declined to say how many jobs the new factories would create. Emerson, a diversified manufacturer with $17.4 billion in sales last year, provides dozens of industries with thousands of products, from tools and large industrial valves to refrigeration, lighting and climate control systems. Its best-known consumer brand may be the InSinkErator garbage disposal. Farr’s new take on U.S. investment reflects a broader questioning of overseas expansions, especially in China, for both political and operational reasons. A survey of top managers at 500 U.S. companies conducted in December by investment bank UBS AG found that 31 percent have moved or are moving production facilities to avoid tariffs. Fifty-eight percent said they expect tariffs to “have a positive impact on domestic investment.” It remains unclear, however, whether and how much the trade policy upheaval will benefit U.S. workers. Many firms fleeing China to avoid U.S. tariffs are not moving to the United States, often choosing locations in Southeast Asia. Those that are expanding U.S. operations are trying to maximize automation to minimize labor costs, and some U.S. industries - such as consumers of steel - have said they plan to cut jobs because tariffs have raised their costs. The renewed domestic focus by Emerson, a major employer of high-skilled workers, nonetheless stands out as a victory for Trump’s protectionism. Emerson has been a poster child for globalization, and its CEO is among the nation’s most influential manufacturing executives. Farr just completed a two-year term as chairman of the National Association of Manufacturers, the sector’s main lobbying organization. Emerson once had an overwhelming U.S. and European focus. But that changed as it joined the stampede of manufacturers moving to emerging markets. When Farr became CEO in 2000, 8 percent of Emerson’s sales were in Asia. Last year, that hit 22 percent, and Emerson now has 26,000 employees in the region, slightly more than in the U.S. and Canada. Most of the company’s 215 factories sprinkled around the globe are now outside the U.S. But one of Farr’s first moves after Trump’s election was to assign a task force of top managers to adapt the firm’s investment plans to a less certain trade environment. The group has produced a top-ten list of potential U.S. locations for new plants. Free trade deals once had almost universal support among Republicans and broad support among Democrats. Farr noted that it was Democratic President Barack Obama who negotiated the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), which Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton once called the “gold standard” of trade agreements. But Clinton turned against the deal during the campaign as Trump’s attacks on trade deals drew applause across the industrial Midwest. Trump withdrew the United States from the sweeping Pacific accord immediately after his election, and many Republican free-traders have since gone silent on the issue or adopted variations of the president’s rhetoric. “You have a growing number in the Republican party aligned with what the President calls ‘America first’ – what others call isolationism,” said Andrew Downs, director of the Mike Downs Center for Indiana Politics at Purdue University Fort Wayne. The tax reform passed by Republicans has also made the U.S. a better place to invest by slashing taxes on businesses, Farr said, saving Emerson $189 million last year. The tax cuts enabled Emerson to grant a 2.9 percent general wage increase worth $42 million and better benefits. Some decisions remain in flux as trade disputes simmer. Emerson had long planned a new factory in Mexico to serve North America, but broke construction into two phases pending the outcome of a revised U.S. trade agreement with Canada and Mexico that awaits congressional approval. The first phase is underway, but the second will only be built if the trade deal goes forward. Forces beyond politics are pushing manufacturers like Emerson to reconsider investments in China, including rising labor and logistics costs there; worries about transferring intellectual property to state-run Chinese firms; and emerging technology to automate factories in high-wage countries. Farr said his meetings with candidate Trump during the campaign convinced him he was serious about overhauling U.S. trade relationships. But Emerson’s renewed commitment to U.S. manufacturing is also part of a larger move by global manufacturers to produce more goods in the regions where they are consumed to save on transportation costs. Foreign companies are also recalibrating, including Dutch multinational Koninklijke Philips NV, one of the world’s largest electronics companies, which last year relied on the United States for 35 percent of its sales. CEO Frans van Houten told investors on a call in January that he is stepping up efforts — like Emerson — to produce more goods where they sell them, moving away from a model of factories specializing in products that are then shipped globally. The push is visible in trade data, said Susan Lund, a partner at McKinsey & Company who studies trade flows. In 2007, 28 percent of global production of goods was traded — moving from one country to another. That share has dropped to 22.5 percent. Emerson’s industrial valve and controls business is one area where Farr plans to move factory capacity to the United States to serve customers there. Emerson produces valves used in everything from fracking to oil refineries and has sprawling research and production facilities in Marshalltown, Iowa, which this fiscal year will receive a $22 million capital investment and three dozen new jobs. U.S. valve factories produced only about half the goods it sold domestically in 2017. Emerson plans to push that to 90 percent by 2021. “We’re looking at two new facilities in Texas,” Farr said. “That will mean taking capacity, and jobs - out of Europe and some out of China - and bringing it to Texas.” (Reporting by Timothy Aeppel Editing by Joseph White and Brian Thevenot)"
