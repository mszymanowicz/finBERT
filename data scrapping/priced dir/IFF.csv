-0.10212055443743431," UPDATE 1-Swiss scent maker Givaudan reports 9.8 pct Q3 sales hike * Sales for Q3 slightly beat forecasts * Fragrance division leading the way * Scent-and-flavours maker sticks to targets (Adds details, background) ZURICH, Oct 9 (Reuters) - Fragrance and flavour maker Givaudan reported an 9.8 percent hike in sales during the third quarter of 2018 on Tuesday, slightly better than analysts had expected, led by strong performance in its fragrances division. “Givaudan continued the year with good business momentum and with the project pipeline and win rates sustained at a high level,” the Swiss company that makes flavours for chicken and fragrances for washing powder said in a statement. The company said it continued to implement price increases to compensate for rising input costs for materials its uses to make its scents and food flavourings. Givaudan posted sales of 1.4 billion Swiss francs ($1.41 billion), narrowly beating forecasts for 1.37 billion francs by analysts in a Reuters poll. It did not give profit figures for the period. In the first nine months of 2018, the Geneva-based company posted sales of 4.1 billion Swiss francs, an increase of 5.7 percent on a like-for-like basis and 8.4 percent increase in Swiss francs. Fragrance and flavour makers are benefiting from consumers’ growing appetite for natural ingredients, a key focus area of recent acquisitions in the industry. Givaudan last month completed its acquisition of natural ingredients group Naturex in a deal that valued the French company at 1.3 billion euros ($1.49 billion). During the quarter Givaudan, which leads the global fragrance and flavour market with a 25 percent share, said its fragrance division increased sales by 6.8 percent on a like-for-like basis which strips out the effects of acquisitions and currency movements. The fragrances unit was helped by strong sales at its fine fragrances business, which makes scents for aftershaves and perfumes. But sales in the group’s flavours division, which offers anything from lemon to seafood and grill flavours to customers in the food and beverage industry, grew more slowly as it struggled with tougher comparisons in North America. Givaudan confirmed its mid-term target for 4-5 percent sales growth on average over a five-year period to 2020. Givaudan’s main competitor is U.S.-based International Flavors & Fragrances that acquired Israel’s Frutarom for $7.1 billion earlier this year, vying for the industry’s top spot with the market leader.

8.672529414134484," Frutarom shareholders approve $7.1 billion deal with IFF TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Shareholders in flavors and ingredients maker Frutarom FRUT.TA have approved its $7.1 billion acquisition by International Flavors & Fragrances IFF.N, the Israeli company said on Tuesday. Frutarom said 94.6 percent of the shareholders who participated in the special meeting, representing 74.7 percent of the voting rights in the company, approved the deal. IFF said in May it would buy Frutarom in a cash and stock deal as it vies for the industry's top spot with market leader Givaudan GIVN.S. Frutarom shareholders, however, rejected granting CEO Ori Yehudai a special one-time bonus of $20 million. The deal, which is subject to regulatory approval, is expected to close in the fourth quarter, Frutarom said."
6.373262792471657," IFF to buy Israel's Frutarom for $7.1 billion, nearing top spot JERUSALEM/NEW YORK (Reuters) - International Flavors & Fragrances Inc IFF.N agreed to buy Israeli flavors and ingredients maker Frutarom FRUT.TA for $7.1 billion in cash and stock on Monday, vying for the industry's top spot with market leader Givaudan GIVN.S. The flavors and fragrances sector was expected to consolidate after Geneva-based Givaudan said in March it planned to launch an offer for French natural ingredients firm Naturex NATU.PA and Israeli media reported last month that Frutarom had attracted takeover interest. The deal marks another bet on the explosion of consumer preferences for smaller upstart brands that feature more natural products focused on health and wellness. “We see in food and cosmetics that some of these small companies have much higher growth rates than the big Unilevers of the world,” IFF Chairman and CEO Andreas Fibig told Reuters. IFF has about 3,000 customers, about half of whom are global multinationals, while Frutarom has about 30,000, one-third of which are private label, while 70 percent are smaller to mid-sized companies. Many consumer goods giants have struggled to post impressive growth in recent years as shoppers put increasing value on fresh and natural products, leading to breezy demand for the enzymes, antioxidants, health ingredients and natural colors both companies sell. Until recently, “the whole space was probably dominated by four players; now we have two players, Givaudan and IFF, who are the clear leaders in that space and everybody else is second-tier or very small and I think that’s part of the industry consolidation and that’s what’s driving us as well,” Fibig told Reuters. Under the terms of the IFF deal, Frutarom’s shareholders will receive $71.19 in cash and 0.249 per share of IFF common stock for $106.25 per share. IFF is to list its shares on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange. IFF, which is paying an 11 percent premium to Frutarom’s May 6 close, also will assume its net debt. The two companies are projected to have combined revenue of $5.3 billion in 2018. ICC Industries Inc, Frutarom’s largest shareholder with a 36 percent stake, will vote in favor of the deal, IFF said. The companies said they expect to realize some $145 million of cost synergies by the third full year after closing, with about 25 percent achieved in the first full year. The deal, expected to close in 6-9 months, is projected to be neutral to adjusted cash earnings per share in the first year and double-digit accretive to adjusted cash earnings per share in the second year."

-8.807542167046392," Givaudan turns to Haitian roots for anti-wrinkle ingredient ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss fragrance and flavors company Givaudan has begun recycling Haitian vetiver roots now used to make oil for fragrances to produce a new cosmetic substance it said can reduce wrinkles and help scents linger longer. Scientists and sustainability experts at Givaudan came up with a product they call Vetivyne by using water-soluble extract from exhausted vetiver roots, a by-product of the extraction procedure used to produce vetiver oil for fragrances, the company said on Monday. In 2012 Givaudan established an organic, fair-trade partnership with Haitian vetiver farmers to improve cultivation practices in the poverty-stricken island nation. With its latest initiative, Givaudan hopes to cash in on increasing demand for products that consumers see as helping trim environmental waste. [reut.rs/2IZtBVc] Vetivyne “contributes to answering the consumers’ need for more inspiring and eco-friendly products”, said Maurizio Volpi, who heads Givaudan’s fragrance division. Other companies including Firmenich and New York-based International Flavors and Fragrances -- along with Givaudan, the world’s leading producer of raw materials for the perfume industry -- have also established sustainable vetiver farming programs in southwest Haiti. Givaudan works with a cooperative of more than 260 vetiver farmers in Haiti, where living conditions in rural areas are among the worst in the world and some families earn $2 per day. Natural catastrophes including a 2010 earthquake that killed some 200,000 people helped plunge Haiti into prolonged chaos, and some have pinned their hopes on vetiver -- known as Haiti’s “super crop” -- to help the economy stabilize. With Givaudan’s new product, the active ingredient “is fully natural, concentrated, odor-free and offers clinically proven skin benefits”, the company said, including skin hydration, suppleness and wrinkle-reduction around the mouth. The company gave no sales forecasts for the ingredient, which also helps boost the duration that a fragrance lasts when applied to the skin, Givaudan said."
