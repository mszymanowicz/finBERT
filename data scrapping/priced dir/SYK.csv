12.630157329016855," Stryker wins approval to buy Wright Medical Group from U.S. antitrust regulator WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Medical device maker Stryker Corp SYK.N has won U.S. antitrust approval to buy Wright Medical Group WMGI.O on condition it sell certain assets, the Federal Trade Commission said on Tuesday. The deal, which was valued at about $4 billion when it was announced late last year, was part of a series of consolidations in the medical device industry and would make Stryker one of the market leaders in implants for the treatment of bone fractures as well joint replacements. To win approval for the deal, the companies agreed that Stryker would sell its businesses that make total ankle replacements, generally used to treat arthritis, and finger joint implants, used to treat advanced arthritis, to DJO Global [RABLE.UL], the FTC said. Stryker did not immediately respond to a request for comment."

A unanimous three-judge panel of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said a judge presiding over the bankruptcy of the salesman, Christopher Ridgeway, was right to award the fees to the medical device maker as a sanction on him and his lawyers at Adams & Reese for failing to explain which fee requests were objectionable.

5.737903813573218," Stryker boosts bone implants with $4 billion Wright Medical buyout (Reuters) - Medical device maker Stryker Corp SYK.N said on Monday it would buy smaller rival Wright Medical Group WMGI.O for about $4 billion in cash, expanding into the fast-growing business of implants for shoulders and wrists. Latest in a series of consolidations in the medical device industry, the deal will catapult Stryker to become one of the market leaders in implants for the treatment of bone fractures as well joint replacements. The 69-year-old Wright Medical, which recorded sales of $836 million last year, also makes implants for foot and ankle. Wells Fargo analyst Larry Biegelsen said the deal would give Stryker a leading position in the shoulder market, which has been a major gap in the device maker’s orthopedic portfolio. “Stryker will meaningfully bolster its ability to compete and innovate in the nearly $2 billion global shoulder market,” Chief Executive Officer Kevin Lobo said on a conference call with analysts. Stryker, however, may have to make some divestments in its ankle implant portfolio to avoid antitrust issues as Wright Medical has a near 70% share of the total ankle replacement market, analyst Biegelsen said. The company said it was too early to tell if any divestitures were required for the deal to go through. The deal will make Stryker the top player in the foot and ankle market, dwarfing Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N, according to Evercore ISI analyst Vijay Kumar. Stryker will also gain access to Wright Medical’s biologics portfolio including its Augment drug-and-device combination product used for bone repair, and its Cartiva implant for foot and ankle. Credit Suisse analyst Matt Miksic sees growth of 7% to 9% in the $2.5 billion upper-body joint implants market, and 8% to 10% in the $1.5 billion lower-body joints market. Stryker’s offer for $30.75 per Wright share represents a premium of 39.7% to the company’s close on Friday. Wright Medical shares were up 30% at $28.64, while Stryker’s shares fell 4.5%. Including debt, the deal values Wright at about $5.4 billion and is expected to close in the second half of 2020. Stryker said it still has the capacity for small acquisitions and will continue to look for opportunities to expand its orthopedics unit, which brought in sales of $1.26 billion in the latest quarter. “We see this deal as a natural fit for Stryker,” Baird analyst Jeff Johnson said, noting the deal carries modest antitrust risks, but should have greater cost savings than management is currently suggesting."

4.088498176548567," Medical device maker Stryker to buy K2M Group for about $1.4 billion (Reuters) - Medical device maker Stryker Corp SYK.N said on Thursday it will buy smaller rival K2M Group Holdings Inc KTWO.O for about $1.4 billion, adding K2M's fast-growing spinal implant technology to its business. Stryker’s offer of $27.50 per K2M share represents a premium of 26 percent to K2M Group’s Wednesday closing price. K2M shares rose 25 percent to $27.27 in early trading, while those of Stryker were marginally down at $170.03. “If one were to have asked us where we would have expected Stryker’s next tuck-in deal to materialize, we would have pointed to Spine (division),” Leerink analyst Richard Newitter said. Analysts said Stryker’s spine unit, which accounted for 6 percent of the company’s $3.32 billion second-quarter revenue, has been struggling of late. K2M, which raked in nearly $300 million in 2017, is a relatively small player in the medical devices market dominated by companies such as Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N and Zimmer Biomet ZBH.N, but has been rapidly capturing market share. “This acquisition underscores our commitment to the spinal market, which is the largest segment of orthopedics with significant unmet needs,” Stryker Chief Executive Officer Kevin Lobo said. Upon closing of the deal, K2M Chief Executive Eric Major will serve as president of Stryker’s spine division and lead the combined business. “This deal will help fill a notable gap of advanced spinal implant technology which Stryker has struggled to fill in recent years,” Baird analyst Jeff Johnson said. Citigroup Global Markets Inc served as financial adviser and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP served as outside legal counsel to Stryker. Piper Jaffray & Co was K2M’s financial adviser, while Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP was its legal adviser."

4.17299579788666," Medical device maker Stryker says not in talks to buy Boston Scientific (Reuters) - Medical device maker Stryker Corp SYK.N is not in talks to buy rival Boston Scientific Corp BSX.N, the company said in a regulatory filing bit.ly/2Jy6VQB on Wednesday, two days after a media report of a potential deal between the two surfaced. Stryker’s shares rose 7 percent to $174 in premarket trading after falling 9 percent in the last two days. Boston Scientific’s shares fell 6.8 percent to $31.60. They closed up 7.4 percent on Monday. There has been rapid consolidation across the healthcare industry in recent years, but there has been a slower stream of larger deals in the medical device sector. A potential deal between Stryker and Boston Scientific would create a combined company with a market value of more than $110 billion. Wall Street analysts said any deal between the two companies would be transformational, but were skeptical about the rationale of the deal. “Stryker is not in discussions with Boston Scientific Corporation regarding a potential acquisition,” Stryker said. The Wall Street Journal had reported on Monday that Stryker had made a takeover approach to Boston Scientific. “The filing from Stryker states that the company is not in discussions with Boston Scientific. It does not deny that prior discussions took place,” Jason Benowitz, senior portfolio manager at Roosevelt Investment Group said. “Putting together a deal for Boston Scientific that creates value for Stryker shareholders would be a challenging high-wire act.” Roosevelt Investment does not own shares in either of the companies."

1.44808229151084," Medical device maker Stryker makes takeover approach to Boston Scientific: WSJ (Reuters) - Medical device maker Stryker Corp has made a takeover approach to rival Boston Scientific Corp, the Wall Street Journal reported on Monday, a combination that would give Stryker a strong position in stroke-preventing heart products. It is not clear whether Boston Scientific is open to a potential acquisition by Stryker, the Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. A deal would create a combined company with a market value of more than $110 billion and a wide breadth of product offerings from cardiology and orthopedics to surgical supplies and neuroscience at a time when leaders in the sector feel the need to be able to offer hospitals and other customers a one-stop shopping experience. Representatives of both Stryker and Boston Scientific declined to comment on the report. But the two have done business before. Stryker bought Boston Scientific’s neurovascular unit in 2010 for $1.5 billion. Shares of Boston Scientific, which has a market value of about $44 billion, closed up 7.4 percent at $34.32, while Stryker shares fell 5.1 percent to close at $169.78. Trading in both stocks was temporarily halted during Monday’s session on the New York Stock Exchange. “If this news is accurate, it would create a roughly $24 billion medtech company, which would place it behind only Medtronic and Johnson & Johnson in total device revenue,” Wells Fargo Securities analyst Lawrence Biegelsen said in a research note. He added that the combination would be one of broader scale with limited product overlap. If the deal were to happen, Stryker would gain Boston Scientific’s line of heart devices, such as stents to prop open clogged arteries, defibrillators to correct dangerous heart rhythms, and its Watchman device to prevent blood clots from traveling around the heart. All of those devices reduce the risk of stroke. The company has numerous other product lines that could enhance Stryker’s offerings, including in orthopedic surgery and neurological surgery products. Boston Scientific lags behind Edwards Lifesciences Corp and Medtronic Plc in the fast-growing heart valve replacement market. It has pinned its hopes on an improved version of its Lotus replacement valve, set for launch in 2019 after withdrawal of an earlier version from Europe last year. Stryker already has a leading position in orthopedics, such as spinal surgery devices and hip and knee replacements, as well as medical and surgical equipment. There has been a slow stream of large consolidation deals in the medical device sector in recent years. “For all the medtech companies, in order to remain and to become a more valuable supplier to their hospital customers, it is really more and more important to be able to offer ... a much more comprehensive product portfolio that sells into all different parts of the hospital under different specialties,” Morningstar analyst Debbie Wang said. Early last year, Abbott Laboratories completed a $25 billion purchase of St Jude Medical, acquiring its chronic pain management business and significantly enhancing its cardiovascular device offerings, such as to treat atrial fibrillation that can significantly raise stroke risk. In one of the largest deals in the sector, Medtronic in early 2015 completed an acquisition of Covidien for about $43 billion. The tax inversion deal enabled formerly Minneapolis-based Medtronic to take advantage of much lower corporate tax rates by moving its headquarters to Ireland and also gain a large portfolio of surgical and hospital products. In 2014, Zimmer merged with Biomet in a $13.3 billion combination of two big providers of orthopedic, surgical and dental products, creating Zimmer Biomet Holdings."
