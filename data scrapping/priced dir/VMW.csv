15.915914022130192," Intel taps VMware's Gelsinger as CEO to fix manufacturing crisis (Reuters) - Intel Corp said on Wednesday it would replace Chief Executive Officer Bob Swan with VMware Inc CEO Pat Gelsinger, who started his career at Intel, to help the company navigate its way out of a manufacturing crisis. For decades the world leader in chip-making technology, Intel has lost its manufacturing edge in recent years to Taiwanese and Korean rivals, and is now debating whether to have others make some of its flagship central processor unit chips, or CPUs, slated for release in 2023. Gelsinger, who started his career at Intel at 18 and spent 30 years at the company, was among the most credible candidates to take the company’s helm, analysts said, and shares rose more than 8% in morning trading. He joined Intel before college, went on to have a storied career at EMC and VMware, and will return to a company at a historic crossroads. Activist investor Third Point LLC last month sent Intel’s board a letter asking it to consider dividing its chip design and manufacturing operations, given that rivals Advanced Micro Devices, Qualcomm and Nvidia Corp outsource their manufacturing work to specialists such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd. Gelsinger has confronted similar transitions as the chief of VMware since 2012. He successfully guided the company, whose software helps companies squeeze more work out of data center servers, from an era of privately owned data centers to public cloud providers, in part by striking a seminal deal with Amazon.com’s Amazon Web Services and keeping abreast of open-source software trends that swept the industry. Gelsinger, who will take the helm at Intel on Feb. 15, led more than a dozen microprocessor programs at Intel and became its first chief technology officer. He started there before college, attending Santa Clara University and Stanford University while also working at Intel. He is a prominent Christian in the largely secular world of Silicon Valley and has written a book on balancing his faith, family and career. In a letter to Intel’s employees, Gelsinger likened the move to coming “home.” “Having begun my career at Intel and learned at the feet of Grove, Noyce and Moore, it’s my privilege and honor to return in this leadership capacity,” Gelsinger said in a statement, referring to the early leaders of Intel. “I have tremendous regard for the company’s rich history and powerful technologies that have created the world’s digital infrastructure.” Analysts expect Intel to strike a partnership with another major chip manufacturer as part of its plan to address its manufacturing challenges. With a company veteran at the helm and recent legislation passed in the United States aimed at retaining advanced domestic semiconductor manufacturing, Intel’s “odds of success are now greatly improved,” Evercore ISI analyst C.J. Muse said in a note to clients. Sources familiar with the matter told Reuters that Gelsinger had turned down the top Intel job before, and it was not immediately clear what had changed his mind. Gelsinger will face years of missteps in Intel’s manufacturing business. Under previous Chief Executive Brian Krzanich, Intel sprawled into new fields such as modem chips without success, while blowing three years of deadlines for its 10-nanometer chipmaking process, allowing rivals such as TSMC and Samsung to gain a lead that some analysts believe is now all but insurmountable. Third Point’s Dan Loeb had sent a letter to Intel’s board of directors late last month urging the company to rein in an outflow of engineers to rival firms, though he stopped short of blaming Swan for the company’s troubles. On Jan. 4, Swan met with Third Point Chief Executive Dan Loeb and Intel Chairman Omar Ishrak, according to a person familiar with the matter. Loeb pushed Intel to find new executives and potential new board members and held at least one followup meeting. Intel on Wednesday said it expects to beat its financial forecast for the fourth quarter of 2020 and that it has made “strong progress” in addressing issues with its 7-nanometer chip manufacturing technology. “From a credibility standpoint, he’s great - he’s probably the one at the top of most people’s list for who they would want to see,” Stacy Rasgon, an analyst at Bernstein, said of Gelsinger’s appointment. Swan, a former chief financial officer from eBay, had served as Intel’s finance chief and was named its interim CEO when Brian Krzanich resigned in June 2018, later getting the permanent job."
2.7837411341154703," U.S. National Security Agency warns of Russian hacking against VMware products (Reuters) - A new cybersecurity alert from the U.S. National Security Agency warns that Russian “state-sponsored” hackers are actively exploiting a software vulnerability in multiple products made by cloud computing company VMware Inc. The NSA said organizations should apply “as soon as possible” a software patch provided by the company on Saturday. If successfully exploited, the vulnerability would allow a hacker to execute operating system commands remotely on the infected device, allowing for the theft or corruption of data, according to the NSA alert. A separate cybersecurity alert by VMware states that the hackers would first need to gain access to a user’s account through a stolen password to fully take advantage of the vulnerability. The Russian government has consistently denied any involvement in malicious cyber activity. This is not the first time the NSA has warned of foreign state-sponsored hacking through a public technical report. The spy agency has been releasing a series of similar reports, detailing hacks by China as well, since the launch of its own internal cyber defense unit in 2019, known as the NSA Cybersecurity Directorate."
-4.336494293382249," VMware, Nvidia partner to make AI chips easier for businesses to use (Reuters) - VMware Inc and Nvidia Corp on Tuesday announced an effort to make VMware’s software for managing data centers work better with Nvidia’s artificial intelligence (AI) chips. VMware makes software that helps businesses get more work out of data center servers by slicing physical machines into “virtual” ones so that more applications can be packed onto each physical machine. Its tools are commonly used by large businesses that operate their own data centers as well as businesses that use cloud computing data centers. For many years, much of VMware’s work focused on making software work better with processors from Intel Corp, which had a dominant market share of data centers. In recent years, as businesses have turned to AI for everything from speech recognition to recognizing patterns in financial data, Nvidia’s market share in data centers has been expanding because its chips are used to speed up such work. VMware’s software tools will work smoothly with Nvidia’s chips to run AI applications without “any kind of specialized setup,” Krish Prasad, head of VMware’s cloud platform business unit, said during a press briefing. Manuvir Das, head of enterprise computing at Nvidia, said: “There is some very important computer science that has been done between the VMware and Nvidia teams to enable this.” “As much as people may think of Nvidia as a hardware company, we are more so a software company today.” The companies said they would give some customers early access to the technology but did not say when it would go on sale."
9.108462469023484," Dell considering spinning off VMware stake, shares surge (Reuters) - Dell Technologies Inc DELL.N is considering spinning off its 81% stake in cloud computing software maker VMware VMW.N, the PC maker said on Wednesday, adding that such a move would not occur before September 2021. The company said the evaluation was in an early stage and it was looking at options including keeping its current ownership. VMware said a spinoff could result in a simpler capital structure and it has formed a special committee for talks with the corporate computing giant. In case of a spinoff, Dell said it would negotiate payment of a special cash dividend by VMware to all its shareholders and would try to formalize commercial arrangements similar to those in place, including intellectual property agreements. If the VMware spinoff proceeds as Dell plans, the PC maker would receive a pro-rated portion of a special dividend to help reduce its debt of $57.3 billion, much of which was taken on during the 2016 acquisition of VMWare’s then-majority owner EMC. VMware could also issue additional debt as part of a transaction. The two sides intend to begin talks well ahead of September 2021, when such a deal would become tax-free under U.S. tax laws. Shares of Dell jumped 8%, while VMware rose 5% in aftermarket trading. Any deal would require VMware shareholder approval. Other options including an outright sale and maintaining the status quo are likely to be considered, according to a source familiar with the matter. VMware is currently Dell’s best-performing unit as it benefits from companies looking to cut costs and move to the cloud, a shift that is being hastened by the coronavirus pandemic. VMWare last year bought two providers of cloud security and developer services in deals that together were valued at about $5 billion. The unit’s revenue increased 12% in the latest reported quarter, even as Dell’s total revenue growth dipped."

-3.153645374052404," Oracle, VMware agree to deal on cloud technology, technical support (Changes “with” in sixth paragraph to “without” in September 16 story.) SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Oracle Corp and VMware Inc on Monday announced a deal designed to resolve years of tension over how Oracle handles technical support for VMware users and make it easier for them to move to Oracle’s cloud computing service. Oracle is competing against Amazon.com Inc and Microsoft Corp to offer cloud services, where businesses use Oracle’s data centers to handle their computing needs. In recent years, cloud providers have worked to woo large businesses that still run their own data centers to move some or all of that work to the cloud. VMware has emerged as a key player because many cloud holdouts use it to power their own data centers. To win over those customers, cloud providers need technical compatibility with VMware. Amazon, Microsoft and Alphabet Inc’s Google have all announced partnerships with VMware in recent years. Oracle, which announced the deal at its annual user conference in San Francisco, OpenWorld, has designed a system to allow joint customers to move VMware-based computing work to its cloud without reworking the code, said Clay Magouyrk, senior vice president of engineering Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. “We’ve focused on giving customers maximal control,” he told Reuters. “We had to do some very fundamental engineering.” The two companies said that Oracle would offer technical support to customers who run its applications on top of VMware. Many companies will not run business-critical systems like financial software without the option for support. Oracle and VMware have clashed in the past over the issue. VMware’s core tool splits up one physical computer server into multiple smaller “virtual” machines to ensure that all of a company’s computers are put to full use. Oracle offered a competing product and was unclear on whether it would provide support when, for example, its financial software was used with VMware. Oracle said on Monday it would now provide support for those situations. “Customers don’t want to deploy two products unless it’s supported by both vendors. This was a stumbling block for the past two decades,” said Sanjay Poonen, chief operating officer for customer operations at VMware, said in an interview. “Our relationship with Oracle is significantly better than it was 20 years ago. It’s a new day.”"
24.171679423832533," Nvidia, VMware release cloud software to court business customers (Reuters) - Chip supplier Nvidia Corp on Monday said it was teaming up with VMware Inc and Amazon.com Inc’s cloud division to court large businesses looking to host artificial intelligence programs in Amazon’s cloud. Nvidia got its start with chips to make computer games more realistic, but in recent years has shifted to supplying chips that speed up artificial intelligence tasks, such as teaching computers to recognize images. Once the domain of Silicon Valley tech firms, artificial intelligence technology is filtering to mainstream businesses that use it for tasks like seeking unseen patterns in their financials to help with forecasting and cost controls. Many of those mainstream businesses use software made by VMware to help shuffle computing work back and forth between their own data centers and cloud data centers owned by Amazon Web Services, depending on where the cost is best. But that has been difficult to do with computer programs that rely on Nvidia chips for a speed boost. On Monday, the companies said Nvidia intends to release a new piece of software called vComputeServer to address the issue and let their joint customers move Nvida-aided computing work around more easily. The companies did not say when the software would be released. (This story has been refiled to correct “w” in VWware name to lower case in headline and lead)."
11.954105782819012," VMware to pay $5 billion for firms offering cloud security, developers platform (Reuters) - VMware Inc said on Thursday it bought two providers of cloud security and cloud developer services in separate deals valued at about $5 billion, as it expands offerings for corporate clients. VMware bought Pivotal Software Inc in a $2.7 billion deal. Dell Technologies Inc is the controlling stakeholder of both companies. Separately, VMware said it would buy software maker Carbon Black Inc for about $2 billion in cash. VMWare makes cloud computing software, while Pivotal provides tools for software developers working on cloud services. Carbon Black has a cloud security platform that uses big data and behavioral analytics to protect against cyber attacks. VMware will pay $26 per share for Carbon Black at a premium of 6% over its Thursday close. Corporations using traditional security products are spending more money and losing more information, VMware Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger said in an interview. “That’s pretty broken,” he said, praising Carbon Black’s platform. The company expects Carbon Black and Pivotal to meaningfully add to its revenue in the first year after closing the deals by January next year. Dell had taken Pivotal public last year for $15 per share. Thursday’s Pivotal deal is for a blended price per share of $11.71, in which Class A stockholders will get $15 per share. Dell’s stake in Pivotal will be exchanged for VMware shares. The company and its founder Michael Dell owned 131.3 million shares of Pivotal Class B stock, not including the 44.2 million shares held by VMware, according to a regulatory filing. Pivotal shares rose 9% in extended trading, while those of Carbon Black were up nearly 6%. VMware shares fell 7% and Dell shares shed 3%. JPMorgan Chase & Co advised VMWare on the two deals.

23.592511578480554," Dell posts revenue jump ahead of voting on VMware offer (Reuters) - Dell Technologies Inc DVMT.N reported a 15 percent rise in quarterly revenue on Thursday, as businesses were forced to upgrade their systems running on older Windows technology and on strong performance by software maker VMware. The results come ahead of voting on the company's offer to buy back shares tied to its 81 percent economic stake in VMware Inc VMW.N, which would allow Dell a return to public markets without going through the rigors of a traditional initial public offer process. Dell earlier this month sweetened its cash-and-stock offer to $23.9 billion, winning backing from shareholders including Carl Icahn, who had opposed the initial bid, as well as from Elliott Management and Canyon Partners. “We expect the transaction to close in this calendar year, with the projected close date and first day of trading for the Class C common stock on the NYSE under the ticker symbol ‘DELL’ on December 28,” Dell’s head of investor relations Robert Williams said on a conference call with analysts. The offer is scheduled to be voted on Dec.11. Dell reported an 11 percent jump in revenue from its Client Solutions Group, which includes products such as desktop PCs, notebooks and tablets, and branded peripherals, for the third quarter ended Nov. 2. The gain was largely due to businesses looking to replace their older machines following Microsoft Corp's MSFT.O decision to stop all support for its Windows 7 operating system early in 2020. “The market has reached a state of stabilization so far this year, primarily driven by strong commercial demand driven by Windows 10 upgrades, being linked to end of Windows 7 support,” said Ishan Dutt, an analyst with research firm Canalys. Dell held 17 percent of the global PC market share year-to-date, behind HP Inc's HPQ.N 23 percent and Lenovo Group Ltd's 0992.HK 21 percent share, according to data from Canalys. HP Inc on Thursday reported an 11 percent rise in revenue in its personal systems business, which also topped analysts’ estimates. On the call, Dell executives said the company has successfully navigated the current list of tariffs. “Where we have incurred in higher cost with tariffs, we can pass that through to end users,” Chief Operating Officer Jeffrey Clarke said. For fiscal year ending 2019, the company expects total adjusted revenue in the range of $90.5 billion and $92 billion. The company had reported adjusted revenue of $79.9 billion for the fiscal year ended Feb.2, 2018. Total revenue rose 15 percent to $22.48 billion in the quarter, while net loss attributable widened to $876 million.

1.4463740198950281," VMware to acquire startup CloudHealth in push to grow cloud offerings SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - VMware Inc will acquire CloudHealth Technologies as part of the information technology company’s continued push into cloud-based software services, the company announced on Monday. The Palo Alto, California, company will pay approximately $500 million for the Boston-based startup, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. VMware will purchase CloudHealth for the company’s cloud management platform, VMware Chief Executive Pat Gelsinger told Reuters. That platform makes it possible for enterprises to control and analyze the costs, compliance and performance of their computing environments across their own data centers and public clouds like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Corp’s Azure. “Anybody who is deploying apps operating in a cloud is utilizing multiple public clouds. How do I manage that complexity? CloudHealth is exactly aligned with that,” Gelsinger said. He declined to comment on the price of the deal. The company announced its acquisition in Las Vegas at VMworld, the company’s annual industry conference, where it also announced a series of new cloud services, including an expansion of the VMware Cloud on AWS partnership with Amazon.com Inc. VMware has been adding subscription-based software services over the past year as more corporations begin to shift their computing and data storage systems off of their own servers and into public clouds. Key to this strategy has been the VMware Cloud on AWS partnership that makes it simple for enterprises to transition onto the cloud. With the addition of CloudHealth, VMware is making it easier for its customers to manage services on other cloud providers, such as Azure and Alphabet Inc’s Google Cloud Platform. “We’re going to refresh the vision that we have for the cloud,” Gelsinger said. Among infrastructure decision makers at enterprises, 91 percent said they use two or more vendor’s public cloud environments, with 19 percent of respondents saying they use between six and nine, according to an April report by Forrester Research. Within the global cloud systems management software, VMware holds 21 percent of the market, followed by Microsoft Corp with 14 percent, according to 2016 figures provided by research firm IDC. That market is projected to be worth $5.4 billion this year and is forecast to reach $10.1 billion in 2021, according to IDC. “Multi-cloud is a growing use case, and it’s something that enterprise IT shops are very interested in,” said Paul Delory, Gartner analyst. “It behooves everyone in this space to work with multiple cloud providers.” VMware expects the acquisition to close this quarter, the company said. Its immediate plans for CloudHealth include the integration of two of VMware’s existing cloud services, analytics tool Wavefront and security tool CloudCoreo. More services will become integrated over time, and CloudHealth, which has hundreds of employees, will continue to operate in Boston, Gelsinger said. Dell owns 81 percent of VMware and considered combining the two companies earlier this year. Dell ultimately proposed to pay $21.7 billion in cash and stock to buy back securities called tracking stock that correspond to its economic interest in VMware, partially funded through a $9 billion special dividend from VMware. Some shareholders in the stock that tracks Dell’s stake in VMware may oppose the deal because they feel the proposal is too low and unfairly transfers value to Dell, sources have said, and a vote is expected in October."

Dell said the agreement values its equity at between $61.1 billion and $70.1 billion, more than twice the value of the $24.9 billion deal that founder and Chief Executive Officer Michael Dell and buyout firm Silver Lake clinched to take the company private in 2013. The transaction will allow Dell to bypass the traditional IPO process, which would likely have involved grilling by stock market investors over Dell’s $52.7 billion debt pile. It also means Dell will not have to raise any new money, because it will pay for the deal by issuing new shares and with a $9 billion dividend it will receive from VMware. Going public gives Michael Dell and Silver Lake the option to eventually sell down their stakes, even as they affirmed on Monday that they had no plans to do so. Following the deal, Michael Dell will own 47 percent to 54 percent of the combined company, while Silver Lake will own between 16 percent and 18 percent. A new public security will give Dell currency it can use to pay for acquisitions beyond cash. The security that Dell is buying back is a so-called tracking stock tied to its 81 percent economic stake in VMware. VMware specializes in virtualisation, which allows multiple systems and applications to run at the same time on the same server, something can cut companies’ IT costs. Dell hopes the deal will allow investors to value it more easily, because it will remove the complexity of the tracking stock, according to sources familiar with the company’s thinking. Dell issued the tracking stock in 2016 to buy data storage company EMC Corp for $67 billion, because it could not pay for the deal in cash. EMC owned the majority stake in VMware, which Dell inherited. Such a security “tracks,” or depends, on the financial performance of a specific business unit or operating division of a company rather than the operations of a company as a whole. Dell will exchange each share of VMware tracking stock DVMT.N for 1.3665 shares of its Class C common stock, or $109 per share in cash, for a total cash consideration of not more than $9 billion. Dell said it will list its Class C shares on the New York Stock Exchange following the completion of the deal that will eliminate its tracking stock. Following the deal, investors who owned the tracking stock will collectively account for between 20.8 percent and 31 percent of Dell’s ownership. The transaction represents a premium of 28.9 percent to the closing price of the tracking stock on Friday. The stock ended 9 percent higher at $92.20 on Monday. VMware shares rose 10.2 percent to $162.02. “We believe that this development is positive for VMware shares not only because it avoids the reverse merger scenario, but also because there is the possibility of VMware being taken out by Dell in the future as a ‘second step’ following this transaction,” FBN Securities analyst Shebly Seyrafi wrote in a note. Michael Dell has turned to dealmaking to transform his company from a PC manufacturer into a broader seller of information technology services to businesses, ranging from storage and servers to networking and cyber security. The strategy is in sharp contrast to that of rival HP Inc HPQ.N, which separated in 2016 from Hewlett Packard Enterprise Co HPE.N, based on the reasoning that two technology companies focused separately on hardware and services would be more nimble. Dell’s strategy is beginning to pay off, as companies look to one-stop shops to help them manage their IT infrastructure on the cloud. Dell reported consolidated adjusted cash flow of $2.4 billion in its latest quarter, up by a third year-on-year. Its total debt has gone down by $4.6 billion since the EMC deal. “Dell is a very different company than it was five years or so years ago. And we’re seeing tremendous momentum inside the business,” Michael Dell told analysts on a conference call."
-4.622888319065877," CORRECTED-UPDATE 3-Dell to buy out VMware tracking stock in move to go public again (Corrects to say holders of Dell’s tracking stock will own between 20.8 percent and 31 percent in Dell after deal, not VMware shareholders) July 2 (Reuters) - Dell Technologies Inc said on Monday it would buy the tracking stock of VMware Inc in a cash and stock deal, taking a step closer to a return to the public market and ending a months-long review of its business. Dell, which owns 80 percent of VMware, issued the tracking stock in 2016 to fund its purchase of data storage firm EMC Corp. The elimination of the tracking stock is aimed at simplifying Dell’s complex ownership structure without overburdening its balance sheet, which bears around $50 billion in debt. The world’s largest private technology company will exchange each share of VMware tracking stock for 1.3665 shares of its Class C common stock, or $109 per share in cash for a total cash consideration of not more than $9 billion. A tracking stock is a type of common stock that “tracks” or depends on the financial performance of a specific business unit or operating division of a company rather than the operations of a company as a whole. Dell said it will list its Class C shares on the New York Stock Exchange following the completion of the deal. The transaction represents a premium of 28.9 percent to closing price of Dell’s tracking stock on Friday. The stock was up 13.5 percent at $96 in premarket trading, while VMware shares rose 14.3 percent to $168. The cash component of the offer will be financed by a one-time $11 billion special dividend that VMware will pay out pro-rata to its shareholders. After the deal, holders of Dell’s tracking stock will own between 20.8 percent and 31 percent of Dell depending on how many investors opt for cash, Dell said. Private equity firm Silver Lake helped bankroll Dell CEO Michael Dell in taking the company private in 2013 in a $24.9 billion leveraged buyout.

11.478026936110313," VMware's profit, revenue beat estimates for fifth straight quarter (Reuters) - VMware Inc VMW.N reported better-than-expected quarterly profit and revenue for the fifth straight quarter on Thursday, as more customers licensed its software products. The company’s shares rose nearly 4 percent to $142.54 in extended trading. The Palo Alto, California-based company’s licensing revenue jumped 20.7 percent to $774 million in the first quarter, beating analysts’ average estimate of $727.3 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.

VMware’s net income jumped nearly four-fold to $942 million, or $2.29 per share, in the quarter ended May 4.

Excluding one-time items, VMware earned $1.26 per share, while total revenue rose 13.8 percent to $2.01 billion.
