12.274141285551433," U.S. Supreme Court to hear pipeline company's bid to seize New Jersey land WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Wednesday agreed to hear a bid by a consortium of energy companies seeking to seize land owned by the state of New Jersey to build a $1 billion natural gas pipeline. The justices agreed to take up an appeal by PennEast Pipeline Company LLC, a joint venture backed by energy companies including Enbridge Inc, of a lower court ruling in favor of New Jersey’s government, which opposed the land seizure. Other companies in the consortium for the 120-mile (190-km) pipeline from Pennsylvania to New Jersey include South Jersey Industries Inc, New Jersey Resources Corp (NJR), Southern Co and UGI Corp. At issue in the case is a 1938 U.S. law called the Natural Gas Act that allows private energy companies to seize “necessary” parcels of land for a project if they have obtained a certificate from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. FERC in 2018 approved PennEast’s request to build the pipeline. The company promptly sued in federal court under the Natural Gas Act to use the federal government’s eminent domain power to gain access to properties along the route. New Jersey opposed construction of the pipeline and did not consent to PennEast’s seizure of properties the state owns or in which it has an interest. PennEast wants the land to build the pipeline, which is designed to deliver 1.1 billion cubic feet per day of gas - enough to supply about 5 million homes - from the Marcellus shale formation in Pennsylvania to customers in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in 2019 that PennEast could not use federal eminent domain to condemn land controlled by the state."

0.4429800519988999," Biden's expected Energy Department pick, Granholm, could lead charge on electric cars WASHINGTON/DETROIT (Reuters) - When Jennifer Granholm was governor of auto-manufacturing Michigan, she led a charge that secured a whopping $1.35 billion in federal funding for companies to make electric cars and batteries in her state. As President-elect Joe Biden’s expected energy secretary, Granholm now faces a bigger task: making good on his campaign promise to help the United States compete with China on electric vehicles (EVs) as part of a $2 trillion plan to fight climate change. Biden has said China was set to dramatically outpace the United States in EV production. But the United States, he said after the Nov. 3 election, could “own” the market with the right green policies. He has promised to build 550,000 EV charging stations and create over 1 million jobs by investing in clean energy research. His transition team did not respond to a request for comment on how Granholm, who sources said on Tuesday would be nominated by Biden, would push EVs. To do so, Biden’s administration will need to coax a closelydivided Congress to approve tax credits and billions of dollars more in stimulus funding. The Democratic president-elect takes office on Jan. 20. Joe Britton, executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association, or ZETA, was optimistic that Granholm, who got green initiatives done in Rust-Belt Michigan, could make a difference. “If we cultivate the electric vehicle sector, we can create hundreds of thousands of manufacturing jobs and Governor Granholm has been a key advocate in driving that economic development,” he said. ZETA, a group of 28 car and utility companies, including Tesla Inc, PG&E Corp and Southern Co, was launched last month to lobby for EV-friendly policies The Energy Department under Granholm, who would need Senate confirmation, could play a critical role in deploying advanced vehicle, battery and supply chain manufacturing, Britton said. That would be a change from Republican President Donald Trump. Under a policy of “energy dominance” to boost oil and natural gas output, his administration rejected new tax credits for EVs, proposed to kill existing ones, and made it easier to sell gasoline-powered vehicles. While most of the Energy Department’s budget goes to modernizing the country’s stockpile of nuclear warheads and cleaning up nuclear sites, a Granholm pick suggests a focus on transport, a large source of greenhouse gas emissions. Granholm, who was Michigan’s governor from 2003 to 2011, worked with Biden on the 2009 bailout of automobile manufacturers General Motors Co and Chrysler, which included incentives for investments in car batteries. The bailout was initiated by Republican President George W. Bush, but mostly overseen by President Barack Obama, a Democrat. Biden was Obama’s vice president. In addition, Granholm helped Michigan’s major carmakers and other companies and universities get $1.3 billion in grants as part of the $787 billion stimulus act passed by Congress in 2009. Granholm said shortly after her governorship ended that the U.S. grants brought 18 companies to Michigan working on lithium-ion batteries and projected those grants would create 63,000 jobs over time. It was not all easy going. One battery company, A123, declared bankruptcy in 2012, leading Republican Mitt Romney, then a presidential candidate, to say that Democrats were “gambling away billions of taxpayer dollars.” The speed bumps years ago were mostly due to the U.S. car industry not being ready for transformation, an expert said. “This is always an issue with any kind of transformative change,” said Kristin Dziczek, vice president, industry, labor & economics at the Center for Automotive Research in Michigan. “Hitting the timing just right is exceedingly rare.” The United States has some catching up to do with China. Sales of EVs in China are expected to be about 1.1 million units this year. Numbers for 2020 U.S. sales were not yet available, but U.S. automakers sold just 326,000 EVs last year. Besides federal funding, much work will have to be done on the nation’s electricity transmission grid to ensure it can take the load of new cars charged with power. “This is a systemic issue,” said Dziczek. “It’s going to require a lot of thought and planning around a number of dimensions, and she’s got good policy chops,” she said of Granholm. The former governor will likely have a strong partner at the Transportation Department. For that agency, Biden has nominated Pete Buttigieg, whose climate plan when he was a candidate for president called for $6 billion in grants and loans for states and cities to partner with companies and unions to deploy millions of EVs. Buttigieg has demonstrated a “commitment to deploying millions of electric vehicles and a robust charging network that will create thousands of domestic manufacturing jobs,” Britton said."

6.274080617828312," U.S. sees $18 billion from purchases in nuclear power agreement with Poland WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States and Poland have struck a nuclear power agreement in which Poland will likely buy $18 billion in nuclear technology from U.S. companies, the U.S. energy department said on Monday. The United States has been competing with China and Russia and other countries to supply nuclear power technology to countries hoping to build their first reactors, or boost their programs. “We are hopeful that the ultimate decisions that are made by Poland ... over a period of time will result in them choosing U.S. technology,” U.S. Energy Secretary Dan Brouillette told reporters in a teleconference. Brouillette said the reactors would help lessen Poland’s dependence on Russia for energy security. Poland, traditionally a large purchaser of Russia’s natural gas, which competes with nuclear power, aims to halt those purchases after 2022. Instead, it will take pipeline deliveries from Norway and liquefied natural gas, from the United States and others. Over the next 18 months, the United States and Poland will work on an a report for the program that seeks to build six reactors, as well as potential financing arrangements, the department said. The first reactors are planned to be in operation by 2033 in a program that will potentially be worth $40 billion, a senior U.S. energy department official said. Poland would buy at least $18 billion from U.S. companies, the official said. Westinghouse, owned by Brookfield Asset Management BAMa.TO, Bechtel and Southern Co SO.N and the U.S. government, will participate in a first step in the agreement, an engineering study for planned plants, the official said. This month the United States and Romania came to an initial $8 billion agreement on the construction of two reactors on the river Danube. Romanian state-owned nuclear power producer Nuclearelectrica ROSNN.BX ended talks with China General Nuclear (CGN) about the construction of the reactors after they had dragged on for six years."
6.922014402559363," NextEra's Duke Energy bid faces plethora of regulatory hurdles NEW YORK (Reuters) - NextEra Energy Inc Chief Executive James Robo joked last week he does not pursue small acquisitions because the reward is not worth the “brain damage” of getting them past regulators. Yet his $65 billion-plus pursuit of Duke Energy Corp will only pay off if he can overcome major regulatory hurdles in putting together the biggest ever U.S. utility deal, industry experts said. Duke rebuffed a takeover approach from NextEra, the world’s largest producer of renewable energy from wind and sun, as inadequate, Reuters reported last Wednesday. The deal would help accelerate Duke’s transition away from coal- and gas-fired power plants. NextEra, already the largest U.S. utility with a home base in Florida, would need approval from regulators in all six states where Duke operates: Florida, Indiana, Kentucky, North Carolina, Ohio and South Carolina. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission would also need to assent, and the Department of Justice has authority to review the deal for potential antitrust issues. “This kind of deal would raise significant regulatory considerations,” said Jane Rueger, a partner at law firm Perkins Coie. Florida would be the area of most regulatory concern, according to industry experts. Of the 8.1 million customers served by privately owned electric utilities in 2019, 7.3 million got their power from Duke or NextEra units Florida Power & Light and Gulf Power, according to the Florida Public Service Commission. Utilities typically pledge to sell assets or build extra transmission lines to assuage anti-monopoly concerns. Duke Energy made such concessions to regulators in the Carolinas and Florida when it bought Progress Energy for $13.7 billion in 2012. NextEra, however, would have to give up significant business in Florida and risk upsetting its relationship with regulators ahead of negotiations on new caps being agreed on the electricity rates it can charge, Guggenheim Securities analysts said. “They could dilute their constructive Florida footprint, chasing after synergies and earnings accretion in less perceived quality states,” the analysts wrote. NextEra did not respond to a comment request. Duke declined to comment. NextEra has previously lost out on acquisitions by not acquiescing to regulatory demands. When it sought to buy Texan power utility Oncor for $18.4 billion four years ago, NextEra was asked by the state regulator to operate Oncor at arm’s length. NextEra declined, arguing it needed board control and the ability to extract cash to fund its dividend. It lost the deal as a result, with Oncor subsequently acquired by Sempra Energy. NextEra had previously spent two years trying to buy Hawaiian Electric Co for $4.3 billion. It abandoned that deal in 2016, amid regulatory concerns the benefits promised by NextEra to local consumers were insufficient. To be sure, NextEra has clinched an acquisition in Florida in the past. It paid $5.1 billion for Gulf Power from Southern Co in 2018, pledging to cap transmission rates for five years, according to a FERC statement at the time. NextEra could also be called upon to make investments in local communities as part of the deal, industry experts said. Utilities are major employers in their state, and regulators often look for commitments that go beyond their standard demands for investment in their grids and restrictions on electricity rate hikes. Duke has a foundation that contributes around $30 million annually to projects across its coverage area, including offering grants to local organizations and struggling customers, according to its website. The company also sponsors the center for performing arts in Raleigh, North Carolina. NextEra also promotes its work in local communities on its website, including volunteering, education programs and sponsorship. The company raised $5.2 million for such projects in 2019. “You would have to explain to each state regulator how a deal would impact their jurisdiction, from the perspective of ratepayers, jobs created or lost, where headquarters will be maintained, and how investment would flow there in the future,” Rueger, the Perkins Coie lawyer, said."

16.59577749367909," U.S. utilities say Biden plan to cut C02 hinges on breakthroughs (Reuters) - The U.S. power industry would struggle to meet presidential hopeful Joe Biden’s proposed mandate that it become carbon neutral by 2035 without some big breakthroughs in clean energy technology, according to a Reuters analysis of planning documents and a survey of top utilities. The country’s top power producers said rapid advances in nascent technologies - such as batteries to store power for lean times, carbon capture to trap waste from fossil fuels and advanced nuclear power - will be critical to reaching net-zero carbon dioxide emissions. But these technologies are currently either too costly for mass deployment or not yet commercially viable, the companies said. Historically, utilities have invested little in emerging technologies because they are required by regulators to keep costs low. Reuters contacted the 10 largest U.S. publicly traded power producers and three others with ambitious greenhouse gas reduction goals to determine their outlook on reducing the carbon dioxide emissions that lead to global warming. All but four responded. The news organization also mined public statements, state regulatory filings and corporate documents to determine these utilities’ views. Those views cast doubt over the feasibility of Biden’s proposed mandate as he prepares to face off with President Donald Trump – a climate change skeptic and booster of fossil fuels - in the November election. “I’m not going to say it’s impossible,” said Adam Richins, Chief Operating Officer of the IDACORP Inc unit Idaho Power, which supplies electricity to parts of Oregon and Idaho and has a plan to supply 100% clean energy by 2045. “I would just say the plan is very ambitious.” (See graphics on U.S energy mix with or without here policy changes.) A spokesman for Biden’s campaign acknowledged the technology gap and said the former vice president’s climate plan includes “historic investment” in clean energy to help utilities meet the carbon-neutral goal. “Joe Biden believes in the potential of American workers’ ingenuity and will mobilize our nation’s talent and grit to build a modern, clean electric infrastructure,” said spokesman Matt Hill. Biden has called climate change the biggest challenge facing America and the world, and in late July announced a proposal to spend $2 trillion on clean energy – paid for through corporate taxes. The power sector accounts for nearly a third of U.S. C02 emissions, roughly on par with transportation, and scientists say slashing output is essential to helping avoid the worst impacts of global warming. Solar and wind power are the most readily available alternatives to fossil fuel plants, and large amounts of both are being added to U.S. grids. But utilities say they need other resources that can be dispatched when the sun goes down or wind is low. The Trump administration has dismantled Obama-era regulations that would have required power producers to slash CO2 emissions 32% below 2005 levels by 2030. White House spokesman Judd Deere said in a statement that Biden’s climate plan included “unrealistic mandates that would cripple America’s economy and crush our poorest communities.” Responding in part to investor pressure or American state-mandated targets, more than half of those contacted by Reuters have pledged to eliminate all of their carbon emissions by 2050 at the latest, with some promising earlier timelines. These include Idaho Power, Pinnacle West Capital Corp unit Arizona Public Service, CMS Energy Corp, Duke Energy Corp, Southern Co, Xcel Energy Inc and Dominion Energy Inc. But none of the companies has fully explained how it will achieve that goal. Xcel, which has among the most aggressive plans to move away from fossil fuels, said it will achieve an 80% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030 with large additions of solar and wind power. But eliminating carbon emissions entirely will take another two decades, the utility said, far longer than Biden’s plan calls for. “We established a 2050 target for a carbon-free electric system because we know that development of those technologies will take time,” Xcel said in a statement. Dominion, Southern, Duke and others for now are relying on large amounts of natural gas-fired power to supplement increased reliance on renewables. Natural gas emits about half as much CO2 as coal when burned, and its increased use in recent years has helped the United States slash emissions. But gas is a potent contributor to climate change when it leaks. Scientists say it has a tendency to escape from infrastructure in the form of methane, a climate-heating component of natural gas. Reuters’ review of utility documents shows that over the next decade, natural gas is expected to make up between a fifth and two-thirds of the companies’ regulated subsidiaries’ energy-producing capacity. Overall, it generates more than a third of U.S. power and will continue to do so through 2035, according to the federal Energy Information Administration. Companies like Duke and Southern have been criticized by fossil-fuel opponents for marketing climate-friendly credentials while moving slowly to eliminate C02 emissions. “These utilities are trying to have their cake and eat it too and hope investors are too dumb to notice,” said Dave Pomerantz, executive director of the Energy and Policy Institute, a group that advocates for a transition to clean energy. Duke spokesman Neil Nissan called the criticism “unfounded,” saying the company has reduced emissions dramatically by retiring coal plants and will double its renewable capacity in the next five years. Southern said natural gas enables the growth of renewables by ensuring grid reliability. Many of the utilities surveyed - including American Electric Power Company Inc, Entergy Corp and Vistra Corp - said they can’t commit to eliminating carbon emissions without new technologies. “Whether these advancements will occur at the level and speed necessary for integration into the power sector’s transition prior to 2030, or even 2050, remains uncertain,” said Mike Twomey, a senior vice president at Entergy. Large-scale batteries that can store renewable power are more expensive than natural gas and typically deliver power for only about four hours. Meanwhile, methods to capture carbon emissions have been dealt a string of setbacks, most recently with the shutdown of Petra Nova, a clean-energy facility in Texas that had been plagued by mechanical problems. It was the only project in the country that captured carbon from a coal-fired power plant. Alternatives like small nuclear reactors and using hydrogen to create electricity have yet to be proven or made widely available commercially. NextEra Energy Inc, for instance, said in July it would build a $65 million pilot project in Florida to produce hydrogen from solar power, but it does not expect the technology to replace natural gas in turbines at a meaningful scale until at least 2030. Some large investors are pressuring the industry to act more swiftly on their pledges to achieve net-zero emissions. “A goal without a plan to achieve that goal is hollow,” said Greg Rivara, spokesman for Illinois State Treasurer Michael Frerichs, who oversees a $31 billion portfolio that includes shares of Southern. The California State Teachers’ Retirement System (CALSTRS), a behemoth pension fund that owns shares of Dominion, Duke and Southern, said it was reasonable for utilities to factor technological advances into their long-term planning. But a portfolio manager warned that investors want to make sure utilities don’t build too many new natural gas plants in the meantime. “It’s fair to say we grill companies pretty hard on that,” said Travis Antoniono, who handles sustainable investments at CALSTRS. The industry is counting, to some degree, on scientific discovery to take them beyond fossil fuels. The Edison Electric Institute, a trade group for investor-owned utilities, said it is halfway through a study of the technologies its members will need to get to a maximum reduction in carbon emissions. “The funny thing about technology is there is always some random breakthrough thing you can’t plan for,” said Emily Fisher, EEI’s general counsel.

5.224940184620012," Southern records coronavirus charge at Georgia Vogtle nuclear plant July 30 (Reuters) - Southern Co said on Thursday it recorded a $149 million pretax charge to income in the second quarter due to possible coronavirus-related increases in the cost of building two long-delayed reactors at its Vogtle nuclear plant in Georgia. Despite possible cost increases, Southern said it still plans to complete the reactors by their regulatory-approved November 2021 and November 2022 in-service dates. In April, Southern’s Georgia Power unit reduced the workforce at the Vogtle construction site by about 20% as absenteeism from the coronavirus increased. Southern said the number of cases at the site declined significantly in May and early June but began increasing again in mid-June and “continues to impact productivity levels and the pace of activity completion.” Georgia Power estimated its share of costs related to COVID-19 mitigation actions and impacts on construction productivity at between $70 million and $115 million. When Georgia utility regulators approved the Vogtle expansion in 2009, the two 1,117-megawatt Westinghouse AP1000 reactors (Units 3 and 4) were expected to cost about $14 billion and enter service in 2016 and 2017. But analysts estimate costs have ballooned to more than $25 billion due to delays related to the nuclear accident at Japan’s Fukushima plant in 2011 and the 2017 bankruptcy of Westinghouse, the project’s former lead contractor. Energy analysts at Mizuho said Southern’s share of Vogtle construction costs will likely be about $1.1 billion over the $7.3 billion deemed reasonable by Georgia regulators. The analysts also estimated Vogtle 4 will not enter service until June 2023. Georgia Power owns 45.7% of the Vogtle expansion and forecast its part of the total capital cost at around $8.5 billion. The company has also estimated its construction financing costs at around $3.0 billion. The project’s other co-owners include Oglethorpe Power Corp, Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia (MEAG Power) and Dalton Utilities."
11.215993493393455," Atlantic Coast natgas pipe cancellation poses supply challenges: Dominion (Reuters) - Dominion Energy Inc said cancellation of the $8 billion Atlantic Coast natural gas pipeline in the United States would present challenges in meeting growing demand but that increased supply of clean energy should fill some of the gap. Dominion was building the pipeline to meet growing gas demand in southeast Virginia and eastern North Carolina. The project was the latest of several in the United States abandoned after long delays in the approval process and as the fall in demand caused by coronavirus makes the case for more capacity less pressing. Dominion and its partner in the project, Duke Energy Corp, said on Sunday they abandoned the 600-mile (966-km) project, which was billions of dollars over budget and years behind schedule. “These communities still need new infrastructure for electric and gas reliability and economic development,” Dominion spokesman Aaron Ruby said. “The cancellation ... will leave some significant challenges unaddressed.” The pipeline would have supplied enough gas for about 7.5 million U.S. homes a day. Analysts at Wood Mackenzie said the real losers from the cancellation would be power consumers in the U.S. Southeast, including units of Duke, Dominion and Southern Co that will need to find other gas supplies to fuel the region’s coal-to-gas switching efforts. Before state governments imposed coronavirus lockdowns, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecast gas demand would reach record highs almost every year through 2050. EIA now projects U.S. demand will drop about 4% in 2020 and another 4% in 2021 from a record high in 2019. Dominion plans to invest up to $55 billion over the next 15 years on zero-carbon generation, energy storage, gas distribution replacement and renewable natural gas. Dominion aims to achieve net-zero carbon dioxide and methane emissions from its power generation and gas infrastructure operations by 2050."
-3.372613865808643," Dominion seeks more time to complete U.S. Atlantic Coast natgas pipe (Reuters) - Dominion Energy Inc asked U.S. energy regulators for two more years to complete the long-delayed $8 billion Atlantic Coast natural gas pipeline from West Virginia to North Carolina, which the company now expects to enter service in early 2022. “Due to unforeseen delays in permitting, additional time is required in order to complete the construction,” Dominion said in a filing late on Tuesday. The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) approved Dominion’s request to build Atlantic Coast in October 2017, authorizing the company to complete the project by October 2020. Atlantic Coast, the nation’s most expensive gas pipe, is one of several projects delayed in recent years by state opposition and local and environmental legal and regulatory battles. The company still needs to renew permits from the U.S. Forest Service and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) that were knocked out by decisions in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, and a state air permit for a compressor in Virginia. Dominion said it expects to receive the necessary approvals by the end of the year. The company already received one ruling in its favor this week when the U.S. Supreme Court reversed a Fourth Circuit decision and ruled that the Forest Service has legal authority to permit the pipe to cross under the Appalachian Trail. Dominion suspended construction of the 600-mile (966-km) project in December 2018 after the Fourth Circuit stayed a biological opinion from the FWS that allowed construction in areas inhabited by endangered species. Atlantic Coast is owned by units of Dominion and Duke Energy Corp. When Dominion started work on the 1.5 billion cubic feet per day pipe in the spring of 2018, the company estimated it would cost $6.0-$6.5 billion and be completed in late 2019."
-3.9911835262359823," U.S. utility Southern Co commits to 'net zero' emissions by 2050 (Reuters) - U.S. utility Southern Co on Wednesday committed to reducing its carbon emissions to “net zero” by 2050 following investor pressure to set a more ambitious goal to combat climate change. The target aligns Southern’s emissions reduction strategy with that of several other major U.S. utilities, including Duke Energy Corp, Xcel Energy Inc and Dominion Energy Inc The Atlanta-based company’s pledge, unveiled at its annual shareholder meeting, goes beyond a 2018 commitment that it would emit “low to no” carbon by 2050, environmental groups said. They had criticized that pledge because “low emissions” could still allow Southern to emit millions of tons of carbon annually. “Net zero” refers to a balance between emissions produced and emissions taken out of the atmosphere. In a statement, Southern said it would achieve the goal by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and investing in technologies like direct air capture of carbon and planting trees. Southern is one of the largest U.S. utilities, serving more than 8 million gas and electric customers. It has invested heavily in renewable energy such as solar and wind in the last decade, but still generates about a quarter of its power from coal and nearly half from natural gas. Late last year, shareholder activist group As You Sow filed a resolution asking Southern to report on the risks of its natural gas assets becoming stranded as the world moves away from fossil fuels to address climate change. The group withdrew that resolution after securing a commitment from Southern that it would provide more information about how its natural gas fleet fits in to its climate strategy. “This commitment does show progress,” Lila Holzman, energy program manager for As You Sow, said in an interview. “We still have concerns around how it is going to get there.”"

-1.3699722405467563," Trump admin slaps solar, wind operators with retroactive rent bills (Reuters) - The Trump administration has ended a two-year rent holiday for solar and wind projects operating on federal lands, handing them whopping retroactive bills at a time the industry is struggling with the fallout of the coronavirus outbreak, according to company officials. The move represents a multi-million-dollar hit to an industry that has already seen installation projects canceled or delayed by the global health crisis, which has cut investment and dimmed the demand outlook for power. It also clashes with broader government efforts in the United States to shield companies from the worst of the economic turmoil through federal loans, waived fees, tax breaks and trimmed regulatory enforcement. U.S. power plant owner Avangrid Inc, majority owned by Spain’s Iberdrola, received a bill for more than $3 million for two years of rent on its 131-megawatt Tule wind project on federal land near San Diego, according to spokesman Paul Copleman. Officials at two other renewable projects also confirmed they had received retroactive rent bills from the federal government but asked not to be named discussing the issue as the industry continues to lobby the government for support to weather the downturn. Some 96 utility-scale solar, wind and geothermal projects operate on lands run by the Interior Department’s Bureau of Land Management, according to The Wilderness Society and Yale Center for Business and the Environment. The bills came as a surprise, said Shannon Eddy, executive director of the Large-scale Solar Association, a trade group for owners of big solar farms. But she said some companies had likely set funds aside in case the bills ever came. The Interior Department had stopped charging the rents at the end of 2018 to review company complaints that former President Barack Obama’s administration had increased them too much, making them uncompetitive with rents on private property. The Interior Department declined repeated requests to comment on the outcome of that review, or the issuance of the retroactive rent bills. A budget document on the Interior Department’s web site shows it expects to collect $50 million in rent fees for wind and solar projects in 2020, up from $1.1 million in 2019 and $21.6 million in 2018. The rent bills landed around the same time the Bureau of Land Management notified oil and gas drillers on federal lands of the procedures they would need to follow to get relief from paying royalties amid an oil market slump. The administration has also expanded the drilling industry’s access to economy-wide government lending facilities and is contemplating ways to pump additional billions of dollars into the sector through tax breaks. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission, meanwhile, recently agreed to a 90-day fee deferral for nuclear power plant owners due to economic disruptions caused by the pandemic. Renewable companies are also facing significant headwinds from the coronavirus. Project delays have threatened their ability to tap lucrative federal subsidies needed to compete with fossil fuels and cut the growth outlook for U.S. wind and solar installations by 5% and 10%, respectively, this year, according to the Energy Information Administration. The industry likes to site its projects on federal lands, particularly near large Western population centers such as Southern California, because they offer ample undeveloped space. Other owners of wind and solar projects on BLM lands include NextEra Energy Inc, NRG Energy Inc, Clearway Energy Inc and Southern Co. Officials from NRG, Clearway and Southern declined to comment and NextEra did not reply to requests for comment. BLM increased the annual amounts renewable energy companies pay in rent during the final weeks of the Obama administration. The rents are calculated based on acreage, as well as the amount of power and the type of technology being used to generate it. Many Western lawmakers, including Wyoming Senator John Barrasso and Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski, both Republicans, have sided with the wind and solar industries in opposing the higher rents."
-0.1320055088442008," Deforestation in Brazil's Amazon surges, Bolsonaro readies troops BRASILIA (Reuters) - Deforestation in Brazil’s Amazon rainforest rose sharply in April, government data showed on Friday, as the coronavirus outbreak keeps many environmental enforcers out of the field and the country prepares to deploy troops to fight illegal logging. Destruction in Brazil’s portion of the Amazon increased 64% in April, compared with the same month a year ago, according to preliminary satellite data from space research agency INPE. In the first four months of the year, Amazon deforestation was up 55% from a year ago to 1,202 square kilometers (464 square miles), according to the INPE data. The Amazon is the world’s largest tropical rainforest, and scientists say its preservation is vital to curb global warming because of the vast amount of greenhouse gas that it absorbs. Destruction of the Amazon surged to an 11-year high last year and continues to climb in 2020, which environmentalists blame on the policies of right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro who has emboldened illegal loggers, miners and ranchers. Bolsonaro has called for more farming and mining in protected areas of the forest, saying it is the only way to lift the region out of poverty. The new coronavirus outbreak has complicated efforts to combat deforestation, with environmental enforcement agency Ibama sending fewer agents into the field due to health risks. The agency has said it will scale back field agents in other at-risk areas but not the Amazon. “The pandemic has not helped because there are apparently less agents out there, and illegal loggers obviously don’t care about the virus in remote areas of the Amazon,” said Paulo Barreto, senior researcher for non-profit Amazon institute Imazon. Barreto and other environmentalists, including Greenpeace, said the surge was already underway last year due to government steps that encouraged illegal logging, in particular a decree now before Congress that could give title to land grabbers who invaded public and indigenous lands. As deforestation soars, Bolsonaro on Thursday authorized the deployment of armed forces to deter illegal loggers and combat deforestation and forest fires in the region. Environmental advocates say the measure may help in the short term but is not a lasting solution. Ibama agents have expressed dismay that deforestation has continued to surge in recent months despite the current rainy season in the Amazon, which makes the jungle harder to traverse and usually deters illegal loggers. Parts of the Amazon that are hot spots for deforestation such as southern Para state have seen higher than average rain levels, which would normally lead to a fall in deforestation, Carlos Nobre, an earth systems scientist at University of Sao Paulo, told Reuters. Nobre warned that the rains will ease in the next three months as the dry season takes hold, which is when deforestation peaks in most years."

-2.8732742499377846," UPDATE 1-Dominion confirms $8 bln Atlantic Coast natgas pipe cost, early 2022 in service (Adds details) May 5 (Reuters) - Dominion Energy Inc confirmed on Tuesday its previous cost and schedule estimates for the roughly $8 billion Atlantic Coast natural gas pipeline from West Virginia to North Carolina that is expected to enter service in early 2022. That cost and schedule, however, depends on the company being allowed to cut trees along the pipeline’s route during the upcoming November 2020-March 2021 season, Dominion Chief Executive Thomas Farrell told analysts after the company released its first quarter earnings. “We can maintain the existing schedule and cost estimates, so long as we can take advantage of the November 2020 through March 2021 tree filling season,” Farrell said, noting “We remain confident in the successful completion of the project.” Atlantic Coast, the nation’s most expensive gas pipe, is one of several projects to have received federal permits in recent years but which have been delayed by state opposition and local and environmental legal and regulatory battles. Farrell said the company expects to overcome those challenges this year. In the Appalachian Trail case, Dominion said it expects the U.S. Supreme Court to rule in its favor in coming weeks, allowing the pipe to cross the trail along its existing route. In the biological opinion case, Farrell said Dominion is working with the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) and expects to receive needed authorizations by the end of this quarter. Dominion suspended construction of the 600-mile (966-kilometer) project in December 2018 after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit stayed a FWS biological opinion. On the Nationwide Permit issue, which the Army Corps of Engineers uses to authorize waterbody crossings, Farrell said he expects the U.S. Department of Justice and industry will resolve a legal opinion that questions the legitimacy of the Army Corps’ use of the program “in a timely manner.” In a case involving TC Energy Corp’s Keystone XL oil pipe, a federal judge in Montana said the Army Corps was inappropriately using the permit program. The Justice Department asked the judge to limit his ruling so it does not affect the entire program, which could stall hundreds of projects. Atlantic Coast is owned by units of Dominion and Duke Energy Corp. When Dominion started work on the 1.5 billion cubic feet per day pipe in the spring of 2018, the company estimated it would cost $6.0-$6.5 billion and be completed in late 2019."

-1.4747662683924094," Southern says coronavirus slows work on new Georgia Vogtle nuclear reactors in U.S (Reuters) - U.S. energy company Southern Co said on Thursday that steps to protect workers from the coronavirus slowed progress on one of the two long-delayed reactors under construction at its Vogtle nuclear plant in Georgia by a couple months. Southern said the target in-service date for Unit 4 is now May 2022, pushed back from March 2022, according to a presentation following the release of its first-quarter earnings. The targeted in-service date for Vogtle Unit 3 remains May 2021. Southern CEO Tom Fanning said the company reduced its workforce at the project site by about 20% in mid-April due to COVID-19. When Georgia utility regulators first approved construction of the Vogtle expansion in 2009, the two 1,117-megawatt (MW) Westinghouse AP1000 reactors (Units 3 and 4) were expected to cost about $14 billion and enter service in 2016 and 2017. Costs have ballooned to more than $25 billion in part due to delays related to the nuclear accident at Japan’s Fukushima plant in 2011 and the 2017 bankruptcy of Westinghouse, the project’s lead contractor, according to analyst estimates. Southern said on Thursday that the project’s projected cost had not changed due to the coronavirus delay. Southern’s Georgia Power unit owns 45.7% of the Vogtle expansion. The project’s other co-owners include Oglethorpe Power Corp, Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia (MEAG Power) and Dalton Utilities. There are already two 1,215-MW reactors - Units 1 and 2 - operating at the Vogtle site."

If approved, that will bring Dominion's share in the pipeline to 53%, up from 48%. Duke Energy Corp DUK.N will own the remaining 47%. Southern will remain an anchor customer of the pipe through its Virginia Natural Gas subsidiary. In addition, Dominion said it agreed to buy Southern’s Pivotal LNG, which distributes liquefied natural gas for marine and road transportation. The total cost of the Atlantic Coast stake and Pivotal was about $175 million, Dominion said. Atlantic Coast, the nation’s most expensive gas pipe, is one of several projects that have received federal permits in recent years but have been delayed by state opposition and local and environmental legal and regulatory battles. Some analysts have questioned whether Dominion will be able to complete Atlantic Coast following numerous delays and cost increases related to regulatory and legal battles over state and federal permits. Dominion CFO James Chapman told analysts on Tuesday: “Major project customers have confirmed their willingness to take on higher project rates given the strategic importance of (Atlantic Coast) as an alternative pipeline option to the region.” Dominion CEO Thomas Farrell told analysts the company could restart pipeline construction after receiving some key permits that are expected during the first half of this year. The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to rule in May or June in a case about whether the pipeline can run underneath the Appalachian Trail in Virginia."

The company said in a filing with the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) that it expects to be able to complete the Pennsylvania section of the pipeline by November 2021. As for New Jersey, the company said it was targeting completion of the second phase of the project from Pennsylvania into New Jersey in 2023. FERC approved PennEast’s request to build the pipeline in January 2018, and the company promptly sued in federal court under the U.S. Natural Gas Act to use the federal government’s eminent domain power to gain access to properties along the route. New Jersey, however, opposed construction of the pipeline and did not consent to PennEast’s condemnation suits on properties the state owns or in which it has an interest. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled in September that the company could not use federal eminent domain to condemn land controlled by the state. That prompted PennEast to ask FERC for a ruling on the issue. FERC on Thursday ruled in favor of PennEast’s view. After FERC’s ruling, PennEast said it would still take the case to the U.S. Supreme Court because the FERC decision alone cannot trump the Third Circuit decision. PennEast needs the New Jersey land to build its 120-mile (193-km) pipeline, which is designed to deliver 1.1 billion cubic feet per day of gas from the Marcellus shale formation in Pennsylvania to customers in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. One billion cubic feet is enough gas to supply about 5 million U.S. homes for one day. The companies seeking to build the $1 billion PennEast project include units of South Jersey Industries Inc, New Jersey Resources Corp (NJR), Southern Co, Enbridge Inc and UGI Corp. Companies with contracts to use the project include units of NJR, SJI, Southern, Public Service Enterprise Group Inc and Consolidated Edison Inc.

-15.720045905434606," Virginia AG files Supreme Court brief opposing Dominion Atlantic Coast natgas pipe (Reuters) - Virginia Attorney General Mark Herring on Wednesday filed a brief in the Atlantic Coast natural gas pipeline case at the U.S. Supreme Court opposing construction of Dominion Energy Inc’s $7.3-$7.8 billion project. Atlantic Coast, the nation’s most expensive gas pipe, is one of several projects that have received federal permits in recent years but have been delayed by state opposition and local and environmental legal and regulatory battles. In the Supreme Court case, Dominion and its partners, Duke Energy Corp and Southern Co, say the U.S. Forest Service was correct in issuing Atlantic Coast a permit to cross the Appalachian Trail in Virginia. In his brief, Herring asked the court to affirm the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling that invalidated the Forest Service permit. “The Forest Service failed to conduct the meticulous review of Atlantic’s permit application called for by the Service’s governing statutes and regulations,” Herring said, noting “the permitting process was rushed and slipshod and driven by Atlantic’s arbitrary deadlines.” Dominion spokesman Aaron Ruby said the company respectfully disagreed with the Attorney General, noting the Forest Service has the full authority to authorize the Appalachian Trail crossing. The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear the case on Feb. 24. Dominion has said it expects to complete Atlantic Coast in early 2022. “Our region’s current infrastructure is not keeping up with growing demand for gas,” Ruby said, noting communities in southeast Virginia and northeast North Carolina are experiencing chronic shortages of gas, forcing utilities to shut off service to major industries and the U.S. military during the winter. Herring, however, questioned whether the project is needed, citing numerous sources that indicate gas demand is actually decreasing, and that renewable energies are becoming more cost competitive. “The ever-rising costs of building [the pipeline] will be passed on to consumers, by the companies that have contracted with Atlantic to carry gas through the pipeline.” When Dominion started work on the 1.5 billion cubic feet per day pipe in the spring of 2018, the company estimated it would cost $6.0-$6.5 billion and be completed in late 2019. In addition to the Appalachian Trail case, the Fourth Circuit also rejected a permit from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), saying the agency’s decisions were arbitrary and would jeopardize endangered species. Dominion suspended construction of the 600-mile (966-kilometer) project in December 2018 after the Fourth Circuit stayed an earlier FWS’ permit."
-22.838633395149078," Dominion still sees U.S. Atlantic Coast natgas pipe online in 2022 despite Morgan Stanley's doubts (Reuters) - Dominion Energy Inc D.N said on Monday it was confident it will complete the proposed $7.3-$7.8 billion Atlantic Coast natural gas pipeline from West Virginia to North Carolina by early 2022, in response to a prediction by investment bank Morgan Stanley that a court decision would likely scuttle the project. “We remain committed to completing the project for the good of our economy and the environment,” Dominion spokesman Aaron Ruby said, noting the company expected to complete construction in late 2021 with final in-service in early 2022. Dominion made its comments after Morgan Stanley said in a report that “Atlantic Coast will likely not be completed given the Fourth Circuit’s likely (in the bank’s view) rejection, for the third time, of a newly issued Biological Opinion and Incidental Take Statement that we expect to come by the first quarter of 2020.” In July, the U.S. Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the Fish and Wildlife Service’s (FWS) second Biological Opinion because the court found the agency’s decisions were arbitrary and would jeopardize the Rusty Patched Bumble Bee and other endangered species. Federal agencies use Biological Opinions when authorizing projects that could adversely affect threatened or endangered species or critical habitats, and issue take statements to limit the number of those species that could be harmed. Ruby said Dominion expects the FWS will issue a new Biological Opinion in the first half of 2020. Dominion suspended construction of the 600-mile (966-kilometer) project in December 2018 after the Fourth Circuit stayed the FWS’ second Biological Opinion. Dominion and its partners, Duke Energy Corp DUK.N and Southern Co SO.N, are also working through a dispute over where the pipeline can cross the Appalachian Trail. The U.S. Supreme Court has agreed to take up the Appalachian Trail case, which is also important for the construction of EQM Midstream Partners LP's EQM.N Mountain Valley gas pipe from West Virginia to Virginia. Analysts at Height Capital Markets said they expect the Supreme Court will issue a ruling in May or June 2020. Analysts at Morningstar said they expect the Appalachian Trail dispute will be resolved by a favorable Supreme Court decision or an administrative or legislative solution. Morningstar said a route revision was the likely compromise for the endangered species dispute but noted that could boost the project’s costs to around $8 billion and push completion into 2022. When Dominion started work on the 1.5 billion cubic feet per day pipe in the spring of 2018, the company estimated it would cost $6.0-$6.5 billion and be completed in late 2019."
11.057164676617747," NYC pension leader targets three utilities over emissions plans BOSTON (Reuters) - New York City’s top pension official has called on three major U.S. utilities to name independent board chairs, pressuring them to “decarbonize” their operations by 2050 and underscoring how power companies have split on whether to set such goals. New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer, who oversees about $208 billion in retirement assets, recently filed shareholder resolutions at Southern Co, Duke Energy Corp and Dominion Energy Inc. The resolutions call for shareholder votes on whether to name independent individuals to chair boards currently led by the chief executive of each company. The change would be “useful to oversee the strategic transformation” of the companies to operate in a low-carbon economy, according to the resolutions, seen by Reuters. U.S. power utilities have largely embraced the idea of cutting emissions to slow climate change, but have split on what exact targets to spell out. A number of utilities, including Xcel Energy Inc and NRG Energy Inc, plan to end emissions by 2050 by using more solar or wind power, retiring coal-burning plants, or reaching “net-zero emissions” with offsets like restoring forests to remove carbon from the atmosphere. Some experts have questioned, however, if new technologies for nuclear power, battery storage or carbon capture will be ready in time to make a 2050 target realistic. (bit.ly/35cRFik) Southern and Dominion have both outlined plans to reduce carbon emissions but have not pledged to end them by 2050. To achieve such a state, “technology will have to evolve beyond where we are today,” Dominion CEO and Chairman Thomas Farrell said at a March investor meeting. A Dominion spokesman said the company is reviewing Stringer’s proposal. A Southern company spokesman said it is reviewing Stringer’s proposal. “We regularly engage with our shareholders and look forward to having a dialogue regarding these matters as well,” said the spokesman. Duke said in September it aims to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. Stringer’s proposed resolution acknowledges the step but notes the utility’s continued spending on natural gas infrastructure. A Duke spokesman said the utility is reviewing the proposal. The majority of S&P 500 companies have an independent board chair, according to Stringer’s office, viewed as a way to improve corporate oversight. Calls to separate the roles of chair and CEO have become a flashpoint at some annual meetings, such as at JPMorgan Chase & Co, whose leader, Jamie Dimon, won bruising votes to keep both roles.[reut.rs/359MIqK] The resolutions mark an escalation from the approach Stringer and other investors took for the 2019 proxy season, when they only requested utilities move to net-zero emissions by 2050.[nL1N20M1X7]"

12.418673080883709," RWE signs 30-year deal to sell U.S. solar power FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German utility RWE on Wednesday announced a 30-year supply deal struck by its U.S. renewables division under which it will sell solar power produced at the 195.5 megawatt (MW) Broken Spoke solar facility in Georgia to utility Georgia Power. Power Purchase Agreements (PPAs), which act as an insurance policy for the operator against falling power prices while locking in a purchase price for consumers, have long been common in the United States, southern Europe and Nordic countries. They are of increasing interest to wholesale markets, consumers and project companies in other geographies that want to harness PPA expertise to spur renewables growth. The Broken Spoke plant will be coupled with a 40 MW 2-hour battery energy storage device and deliver to Georgia Power, the largest subsidiary of U.S. gas and electricity holding company Southern Company, from 2021, both firms said in a joint press release. Financial details were not disclosed, which is typical for PPAs for competitive reasons. “This integrated solar plus storage facility will increase energy delivery during peak demand times and simplify integration of locally produced energy into the Georgia Power grid,” said Christoph Hunfeld, RWE’s head of asset commercialization North America. Essen-based RWE is diversifying from its role as traditional coal-burning utility and, by virtue of carving up subsidiary Innogy in an elaborate swap deal with rival E.ON, is becoming one of the largest renewable players worldwide. It has committed to pouring an annual sum of 1.5 billion euros in net capital expenditure into the sector. Project partnerships have the potential to increase total investment to between 2 and 3 billion euros per annum, it reiterated. In the U.S., it has installed renewable capacity totaling 3.3 GW, while also commanding 1.4 GW under construction and a large project pipeline."
4.517170964377254," New Jersey denies permit for PennEast natgas pipeline: state governor (Reuters) - New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy tweeted on Friday that state environmental regulators denied a permit that PennEast Pipeline Co needed to build its proposed $1 billion natural gas pipe from Pennsylvania to New Jersey. The decision followed a ruling by a U.S. appeals court in September that barred PennEast from using federal law to seize properties controlled by New Jersey to build the project. In his tweet, Murphy posted a letter from the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection denying PennEast’s application for a Water Quality Certificate because the company “no longer has the legal authority to perform activities on 49 properties along the proposed pipeline” route after the court ruling. “My administration fought and won in court to stop the proposed ... pipeline. We are committed to transition New Jersey to 100% clean energy by 2050,” Murphy said. PennEast obtained approval from the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to build the pipeline in January 2018 and promptly sued in federal court to use the federal government’s eminent domain power to gain access to 131 properties along the route in New Jersey under the U.S. Natural Gas Act. New Jersey did not consent to PennEast’s condemnation suits on properties it controls. The state holds interests in most of the properties through easements requiring the land be preserved for recreational, conservation or agricultural use. PennEast needs the land to build its 120-mile (190-km) pipeline, which is designed to deliver gas from the Marcellus shale formation in Pennsylvania to customers in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Patricia Kornick, a spokeswoman for PennEast, said the company “is confident the legal actions will be resolved favorably and the long-standing legal precedent under which FERC has operated ... will be upheld.” The company has said it anticipates starting construction on the pipeline in 2020.

2.661470400089568," New Jersey wins legal challenge to PennEast natgas pipeline (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday barred PennEast Pipeline Co from using a federal law to seize properties controlled by the state of New Jersey in order to build a proposed $1 billion natural gas pipeline. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit said in its decision that the U.S. Natural Gas Act does not allow companies to condemn state controlled land in federal court because states enjoy sovereign immunity from such actions under the Eleventh Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. PennEast obtained approval from the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to build the pipeline from Pennsylvania to New Jersey in January 2018 and promptly sued in federal district court to use the federal government’s eminent domain power to gain access to 131 properties along the route in New Jersey under the U.S. Natural Gas Act. New Jersey, which opposes construction of the pipe, did not consent to PennEast’s condemnation suits on 42 of the 131 properties it controls.

13.365580074577563," U.S., Dominion Energy ask Supreme Court to hear Atlantic Coast natgas pipe case (Reuters) - The U.S. Solicitor General and Dominion Energy Inc asked the Supreme Court to hear an appeal of a decision that stopped Dominion from building the Atlantic Coast natural gas pipeline across the Appalachian Trail in Virginia. Solicitor General Noel Francisco and Dominion argued in their filings on Tuesday that the Richmond, Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals decision in the Cowpasture v. U.S. Forest Service case impedes energy infrastructure development on the East Coast. In December, the appeals court vacated a permit that allowed the Atlantic Coast pipe to cross the Appalachian Trail on National Forest land because the court said the Forest Service lacks authority to grant pipeline rights-of-way across the trail on federal land. Dominion said the decision could turn the Appalachian Trail into a 2,200-mile (3,541-kilometer) barrier separating resource-rich areas to its west from consumers to its east. The company noted there were already approximately 56 pipelines across the Appalachian Trail. Some energy analysts think there is a good chance the Supreme Court will hear the case and have warned Dominion may cancel the project if the court refuses to hear it. “After reading the Solicitor General’s arguments, we’re increasing our odds to just under 50% that the Supreme Court decides to hear the case,” Josh Price, senior analyst at Height Capital Markets in Washington said in a note on Wednesday. “We believe the Court may view this as an issue of national importance,” Price said, noting “if the court declines to take up the case or upholds the ruling, we anticipate (Atlantic Coast) owners may cancel the projects.” Dominion, however, said it plans to complete the project and believes it has a good chance of getting the Supreme Court to hear the case and support its view. Dominion has said it hopes to overcome other legal challenges that will allow it to resume construction of the $7.0-$7.5 billion pipeline later this year and complete it in 2021. Dominion suspended construction in early December after the Fourth Circuit in another case stayed a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service permit that authorized Dominion to build the pipe in areas inhabited by threatened or endangered species. When Dominion started work on the 600-mile pipe from West Virginia to North Carolina in the spring of 2018, the company estimated it would cost $6.0-$6.5 billion and be completed in late 2019."
9.195451506845139," U.S. asks Supreme Court for more time on Atlantic Coast natgas pipe appeal (Reuters) - The U.S. Solicitor General asked the Supreme Court on Wednesday to extend the time the government has to file a petition in an appeal of a circuit court decision preventing Dominion Energy Inc from building the Atlantic Coast natural gas pipeline across the Appalachian Trail in Virginia. Solicitor General Noel Francisco is seeking a one-month extension until June 25. Without the extension, the time expires on May 28. Some analysts think Dominion could cancel the pipeline if the Supreme Court does not hear the case because the project’s costs have ballooned due to legal and regulatory delays. In December, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in the Cowpasture v U.S. Forest Service case vacated a permit that allowed the pipe to cross the Appalachian Trail on National Forest land. The court determined the Forest Service lacks authority to grant pipeline rights-of-way across the trail on federal land. Dominion said it welcomed news that the Solicitor General would join the case, noting for decades that 56 other pipelines have operated across the Appalachian Trail. Earlier this month, Dominion’s Chief Executive Thomas Farrell said it would increase the chances the court will hear the case if the Solicitor General joins the appeal. Farrell said Dominion hopes to overcome other legal challenges that will allow the company to resume construction of the $7.0 billion to $7.5 billion pipeline in the third quarter and complete it by early 2021. Dominion suspended construction in early December after the Fourth Circuit stayed a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service permit that authorized building the pipe in areas inhabited by threatened or endangered species. Analysts at Height Capital Markets in Washington, DC, said they expect the Supreme Court to grant the extension but do not expect the court to take up the case. The court will likely make a decision in the fourth quarter. “If the court declines to hear the case, we anticipate Dominion and Duke will decide to terminate the project as rerouting the pipeline would likely be cost prohibitive,” the Height Capital Markets analysts said, noting it will be “extremely difficult” for the utilities to pass on additional costs to ratepayers. Atlantic Coast is a partnership between Dominion, Duke Energy Corp and Southern Co. When Dominion started work on the 600-mile (966-km) pipe from West Virginia to North Carolina in the spring of 2018, the company estimated it would cost $6.0 billion to $6.5 billion and be completed in late 2019."
8.988507596478252," Dominion to resume work on U.S. Atlantic Coast natgas pipe in third quarter (Reuters) - Dominion Energy Inc said on Friday it expects to resume construction of the $7.0 billion-$7.5 billion Atlantic Coast natural gas pipeline from West Virginia to North Carolina in the third quarter and complete it by early 2021, despite legal and regulatory challenges. “It’s been a very frustrating process, but we are winding our way through it ... and we’re making progress,” Dominion Chief Executive Thomas Farrell said on Dominion’s first-quarter earnings call. The company still needs to resolve two major legal cases before it can complete the project, which has been on hold since late last year. Atlantic Coast is designed to carry 1.5 billion cubic feet per day of gas from the Marcellus and Utica shale in Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia to the U.S. Southeast. One billion cubic feet is enough gas for about five million U.S. homes for a day. Dominion suspended construction in early December after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit stayed a permit from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service that authorized building the pipe in areas inhabited by threatened or endangered species. The company said oral arguments in that case will be presented on May 9, with a decision expected about 90 days later. Dominion said a positive decision would allow it to restart partial construction in the third quarter. Dominion is also seeking an order from the U.S. Supreme Court overturning a Fourth Circuit decision that invalidated the U.S. Forest Service’s authorization to build the pipe across the Appalachian Trail. That case, if the Supreme Court takes it up, would be heard in 2020, so full construction would resume after that decision, Dominion said. When the company started work on the 600-mile (966-km) Atlantic Coast in the spring of 2018, Dominion said it expected the project would cost an estimated $6.0 billion-$6.5 billion and be completed in late 2019. Since then, Dominion has upped the project costs and extended the timeline. Atlantic Coast is a partnership between units of Dominion, Duke Energy Corp and Southern Co."
9.720192290013681," U.S finalizes $3.7 billion loan for Vogtle nuclear power plant WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Energy Department on Friday finalized up to $3.7 billion in loan guarantees to finance the construction of two reactors at the delayed Vogtle nuclear power plant in Georgia, tapping a program zeroed out in President Donald Trump’s latest budget. The financing for Vogtle, the first new nuclear power plant to be licensed and begin construction in the United States in more than three decades, was first announced in 2017. The decision brings the federal government’s total in loan guarantees for Vogtle to $12 billion, some of which was provided in 2014 and 2015, during the administration of President Barack Obama. Up to $1.67 billion will go to Georgia Power Co, a subsidiary of Southern Co; up to $1.6 billion will go to Oglethorpe Power Corp; and up to $415 million will go to three subsidiaries of the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia. “This is the real new green deal, that’s what we’re looking at here folks,” Energy Secretary Rick Perry told workers and politicians at a ceremony at the plant. Perry was apparently referencing the Green New Deal, a non-binding resolution in Congress introduced by Democrats that aims to spark ways to cut greenhouse gas emissions and boost investments in renewable energy, but leaves the door open for nuclear power. Perry conceded that the U.S. nuclear industry has suffered recent challenges, but declared that nuclear power was back and said the world would be looking to the United States for nuclear technology and workers for the supply chain. U.S. nuclear power has struggled amid rising costs for safety upgrades and in the face of competition from solar and wind power and plants that burn cheap and abundant natural gas. In 2017 utilities abandoned two unfinished reactors called V.C. Summer in South Carolina that were once hailed as the start of a U.S. nuclear power renaissance. The reactors at Vogtle are years behind schedule, and the construction cost has soared to $20 billion or more. Trump’s budgets, including the one submitted earlier this month to Congress, have called for axing the Department of Energy’s loan guarantee program that has supported numerous renewable energy and energy efficiency projects. But the previous requests never became law and this one has less of a chance with the takeover of the House of Representatives by Democrats in last year’s elections. Critics of subsidies slammed the loan guarantees, saying that taxpayers would foot the bill if Vogtle fails."

10.080032151444398," UPDATE 1-Dominion confident it will complete W. Va.-N.C. Atlantic Coast natgas pipe (Recasts, adds analyst comment, details and background) Feb 26 (Reuters) - Dominion Energy Inc said on Tuesday it remains “confident” it will complete the $7.0 billion to $7.5 billion Atlantic Coast natural gas pipeline from West Virginia to North Carolina despite a court decision denying its request for a rehearing on a permit. On Monday, the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals denied Atlantic Coast’s request for an en banc rehearing related to the court’s invalidation of the project’s U.S. Forest Service Appalachian Trail crossing authorization. The company said it expects to file an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court in the next 90 days and is also pursuing legislative and administrative options to obtain the approvals needed to continue building the pipeline. The company said it believes it could restart at least partial construction in the third quarter of 2019. Dominion suspended construction in early December after the appellate court stayed a permit from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service that authorized the pipe to be built in areas inhabited by threatened or endangered species. Analysts at Height Capital Markets in Washington said in a report they believe it would be more prudent for the pipeline to reroute through a section of the Appalachian Trail on private- or state-owned land. “Re-routing would likely take less time than a Supreme Court proceeding or an Act of Congress,” Height Capital Markets said, noting they expect the pipe will enter service in the fourth quarter of 2020 if the companies remain committed to the project. On Feb. 1, the company said it planned to put part of the project into service in late 2020 and complete the full 600-mile (966-km) project in early 2021. When the company started work on Atlantic Coast last spring, Dominion said it expected the project would cost an estimated $6.0 billion to $6.5 billion and be completed in late 2019. The company boosted that cost estimate to $6.5 billion to $7.0 billion and delayed the completion to mid-2020 last November. In February, it raised the estimate to $7.0 billion to $7.5 billion and delayed the completion to early 2021 due to delays caused by numerous environmental lawsuits, among other things.

11.97609793033763," U.S. regulator sides with power suppliers over PG&E contracts (Reuters) - Federal energy regulators said on Friday they had joint jurisdiction with a bankruptcy court over any requests to cancel or renegotiate power contracts by California utility PG&E Corp, which is preparing to file for bankruptcy. The order by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission was a win for power producers that supply PG&E with vast amounts with solar and wind power. NextEra Energy Inc, which has several contracts with PG&E, last week asked FERC to declare that PG&E may not modify its wholesale power contracts without the commission’s approval if it files for bankruptcy. Several other power producers filed comments in support of NextEra’s request, including Exelon Corp, NRG Energy Inc, Consolidated Edison Inc, First Solar Inc and Southern Co. PG&E has said it is preparing to file for bankruptcy as soon as next week. The utility faces billions of dollars in potential liabilities from devastating wildfires in 2017 and 2018. The question of what will happen to the utility’s contracts for renewable power is critical for California, which last year delivered 33 percent of its energy from renewable sources and has a goal to source 60 percent of its power from renewables by 2030. PG&E has more than 250 contracts for renewable power that represent $57 billion in investment, it said last month. PG&E earlier this week argued in response to NextEra’s request that only the bankruptcy court would have jurisdiction over its renewable power contracts, not FERC. FERC said on Friday it was not persuaded by PG&E’s argument. It acknowledged that the law was “unsettled” but said “these agreements are still subject to the Commission’s jurisdiction and the Commission maintains discretion to exercise its authority.” “We are reviewing FERC’s order and will respond at the appropriate time,” a PG&E spokeswoman said in an emailed statement to Reuters. NextEra was not immediately available for comment."
13.65719994197189," Virginia gives Dominion permit for Atlantic Coast natgas pipe compressor (Reuters) - An environmental board in Virginia unanimously approved an air permit for a compressor station on Tuesday for Dominion Energy Inc’s planned nearly $7 billion Atlantic Coast natural gas pipeline from West Virginia to North Carolina. The fight over the permit was just one of several battles Atlantic Coast and other pipelines are facing to move gas from the Marcellus and Utica shale in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio to customers in the U.S. Southeast. There are two big gas pipes under construction in Virginia - Atlantic Coast and EQM Midstream Partners LP’s Mountain Valley project. Both are at least $1 billion over budget and about a year behind schedule due primarily to legal battles with environmental and local groups opposed to the projects. “While the (compressor) approval process has concluded, we know we have to continue building trust in the community,” Karl Neddenien, spokesman for Atlantic Coast said in an email, noting the company will invest in a new community center, a rescue squad and more. In December, the Virginia Air Pollution Control Board delayed a vote on the compressor over concerns it would violate civil rights by forcing the historically African-American Union Hill community to bear an unequal burden from pollution and other disruptions. In addition to the compressor permit, Dominion has been dealing with legal battles over other state and federal permits. In early December, Dominion suspended all construction on Atlantic Coast after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit stayed the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s Incidental Take Statement, which authorized pipeline construction in areas inhabited by threatened or endangered species. Neddenien said construction of the 600-mile (966-km) project remains on hold pending clarification of the scope of the Fish and Wildlife permit stay. Before the court issued the stay, Dominion said it expected to complete Atlantic Coast in mid-2020. Now, however, the company said it was waiting for the outcome of its request for clarification before offering any update on the project’s schedule or cost. Analysts at Height Capital Markets in Washington, D.C., said in a report that they do not expect Atlantic Coast to enter service until the fourth quarter of 2020, assuming the utilities remain committed to the project. Atlantic Coast, which is designed to carry 1.5 billion cubic feet per day of gas, is a partnership between units of Dominion, Duke Energy Corp and Southern Co."
9.777842898931526," Energy Transfer completes last segments of Rover natgas pipe in W Virginia Nov 2 (Reuters) - U.S. pipeline company Energy Transfer LP said on Friday that federal energy regulators approved the company’s request to put the last two segments of its $4.2 billion Rover natural gas pipeline into service: * The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) allowed Energy Transfer to put its Sherwood and CGT laterals in West Virginia into service. * Energy Transfer originally planned to complete Rover in November 2017, but since starting construction in March 2017, has been delayed by numerous notices of violation in Ohio and other states, some of which led to temporary stop work orders from state and federal regulators. * The 713-mile (1,148-kilometer) Rover is designed to carry up to 3.25 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) of gas from Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio to Michigan. * One billion cubic feet is enough gas to supply about five million U.S. homes for a day. * Rover has been entering service in phases since August 2017 as Energy Transfer completed each section. * Major producers signed up to use Rover include units of privately held Ascent Resources, Antero Resources Corp, Range Resources Corp, Southwestern Energy Co, Eclipse Resources Corp and EQT Corp. * Rover is one of several pipelines under construction this year to connect growing output from the Marcellus and Utica shale basins in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio to customers in other parts of the United States and Canada. * New pipelines built to remove gas from the Appalachia region will enable shale drillers there to boost output in to a projected record high of around 29.8 bcfd in November from 26.1 bcfd during the same month a year ago, according to federal energy data. * That represents about 36 percent of the nation’s total dry gas output of 81.1 bcfd expected on average in 2018. The Appalachia region produced just 1.6 bcfd, or 3 percent of the country’s total production, in 2008."

8.429901125732101," U.S. oil firms restoring operations in storm-tossed Gulf of Mexico HOUSTON, Oct 11 (Reuters) - Oil producers on Thursday were checking Gulf of Mexico production platforms and beginning to return crews to more than 90 offshore facilities evacuated this week as Hurricane Michael moved through the Gulf. Production shut-ins that temporarily halted 42 percent of Gulf oil output and nearly a third of natural gas production was restarting in some areas. BP Plc conducted its first flyovers on Wednesday to check the status of four platforms that were evacuated, said spokesman Jason Ryan. Restarting production can take several days. Producers lost about 1.7 million barrels of oil through Wednesday as a result of shut-ins and the figure is expected to rise. However, Gulf production cuts have been less of an impact on supplies due to rising volumes of U.S. shale oil. The storm brought winds of up to 155 miles per hour (250 kph) when it made landfall in the Florida Panhandle on Wednesday. Drenching rains were falling on Georgia and the Carolinas on Thursday as Florida residents assessed the damage to coastal areas. U.S. crude futures continued to drop for second day, losing $1.39 to $71.78 in morning trade, after OPEC again cut its forecast of global oil demand growth for 2019 over economic worries. Anadarko Petroleum Corp said on Thursday it had expanded its shut-ins to three offshore platforms, and for safety reasons was waiting to return workers. Gas production should move up to 2.3 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) on Thursday from a low of 2.2 bcfd on Tuesday, according to Refinitiv data.

6.820468651091777," Hurricane knocks out 42 percent of U.S. Gulf of Mexico oil output HOUSTON (Reuters) - Hurricane Michael on Wednesday cut 42 percent of U.S. Gulf of Mexico daily crude oil production and nearly a third of natural gas output, the largest reductions in a year, after companies evacuated staff and shut-in platforms as a precaution. Michael slammed into the Florida Panhandle on Wednesday as a fast-moving, Category 4 storm bringing heavy rains and winds of 155 miles per hour (249 kph) to the U.S. southeast. Companies turned off daily production of 718,877 barrels of oil and 812 million cubic feet of natural gas by midday on Wednesday, according to the federal offshore regulator, the Bureau of Safety and Environmental Enforcement (BSEE). Despite the fall in output, U.S. crude futures CLc1 settled down more than 2 percent at $73.17 per barrel on Wednesday, tracking the weaker U.S. stock market and reflecting the declining importance of Gulf of Mexico output due to burgeoning growth from onshore shale fields. Wednesday’s cuts represent about 6.5 percent of the nation’s daily output of 11.1 million barrels of crude. It is the most since Hurricane Nate a year ago curtailed more than 90 percent of Gulf oil production. Total crude output lost in the last three days from shut-ins amounted to 1.7 million barrels, according to BSEE data. It can take several days after a storm passes to restaff and check equipment before production can resume. Oil producers including Anadarko Petroleum Corp APC.N, BHP Billiton BLT.L, BP BP.L, Chevron Corp CVX.N and Exxon Mobil Corp XOM.N evacuated workers from 89 Gulf production platforms before the storm entered the Gulf. Kinder Morgan Inc KMI.N, North America's second largest energy pipeline operators, said its fuel and natural gas lines serving the Southeast were unaffected. Construction at its Elba Island, Georgia, liquefied natural gas (LNG) project will be suspended on Thursday and resume once the storm passes. U.S. Gulf Coast oil refineries were not in the path of the storm and continued to operate. The Louisiana Offshore Oil Port LLC, the only port in the United States capable of fully loading and unloading supertankers, halted operations at its marine terminal. A week ago, drillers were pulling about 3.4 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) of natural gas from offshore Gulf of Mexico wells. On Tuesday, that was down to just 2.2 bcfd, according to data from Refinitiv. Southern Co SO.N, the biggest power company in Georgia and Alabama, on Wednesday reduced power in two units at the Farley nuclear power plant in Alabama as a precautionary measure. The reduced operating level will allow personnel to continue monitoring the storm’s progress and if necessary shut the 1,751-megawatt Farley plant, which is about 90 miles (145 km) north of the coast. More than 162,000 customers in Florida, Georgia and Alabama were without power on Wednesday, according to local power companies, and the outages were expected to rise as the storm moved farther inland."

Southern Co, the biggest power company in Georgia and Alabama, said all of its nuclear power plants were operating at or near full power early Wednesday. Southern said it was waiting for the latest weather reports before deciding whether to shut the 1,751-megawatt Farley plant in southern Alabama. Farley is the company’s reactor closest to where Hurricane Michael is expected to make landfall. U.S. crude futures were trading down over 1 percent at $74.14 per barrel Wednesday morning, reflecting the declining importance of Gulf of Mexico output that has resulted from the growth of production from the nation’s onshore shale fields. Crude output lost in the two days of storm shut-ins represents about 9 percent of the U.S. production of 11.1 million barrels per day, according to data from the Energy Information Administration. In addition to shutting in wells, oil producers halted most offshore drilling operations by evacuating three drilling rigs and moving eight others out of the storm area, BSEE said."

3.4451621174335445," Dominion does not expect U.S. court order to hold up Atlantic Coast pipe (Reuters) - Dominion Energy Inc said on Tuesday it does not expect a court decision to stay a federal permit for part of its Atlantic Coast natural gas pipeline to delay construction of the $6-$6.5 billion project from West Virginia to North Carolina, which the company aims to complete by the end of 2019. On Monday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit issued an order staying implementation of a permit from the U.S. Forest Service for the pipeline. That Forest Service permit authorized construction and operation of Atlantic Coast on national forest lands in Virginia and West Virginia. Dominion said the Forest Service permit affects only 20 miles (32-km) of the 600-mile pipeline designed to carry 1.5-billion cubic feet per day. One billion cubic feet is enough to fuel about 5 million U.S. homes for a day. “While we respectfully disagree with the Court’s ruling, it will not have a significant impact on our construction schedule,” Dominion spokesman Aaron Ruby said in an email. “We will continue working in all other areas of West Virginia and North Carolina, where we are making significant progress,” Ruby said. The Southern Environmental Law Center, which opposes the pipeline, asked the U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) on Tuesday to stop work on the entire project due to the court’s latest ruling. The Fourth Circuit decision was the third time in four months the court has vacated or stayed federal authorizations for Atlantic Coast, the Southern Environmental Law Center said in its FERC filing. FERC regulates construction of interstate gas pipelines and has temporarily stopped work on parts of the Atlantic Coast project in the past due to prior Fourth Circuit court rulings. “Opponents’ delay tactics will not stop this project. They will only drive up consumer energy costs, delay the transition to cleaner energy, and make it harder for public utilities to reliably serve their customers,” Ruby said, noting “We will complete this project.” Atlantic Coast is a partnership between units of Virginia energy company Dominion (48 percent), North Carolina’s Duke Energy Corp (47 percent) and Georgia energy company Southern Co (5 percent). Dominion will build and operate the pipe. Atlantic Coast is one of several pipelines currently under construction to connect growing output from the Marcellus and Utica shale basins in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio to customers in other parts of the United States and Canada."

Facebook Inc disclosed it had taken down dozens of fake accounts after identifying a new coordinated political influence campaign to mislead users and organize rallies ahead of this year’s elections. “Any attempt to interfere in our elections is an affront to our democracy and it will not be allowed,” Pence told business executives, government officials and security experts at a Department of Homeland Security cyber summit in New York. “The United States of America will not tolerate any foreign interference in our elections from any nation state.” Pence did not specifically mention Facebook’s disclosure. But he said he and U.S. President Donald Trump accepted the assessment by U.S. intelligence agencies that Russia had meddled in the 2016 presidential election. Trump has made conflicting statements on that assessment, sometimes saying he is not sure that Russia sought to interfere in the 2016 race. U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller is probing whether Trump campaign officials worked with Moscow to try to sway the 2016 presidential election. Russia has denied meddling and Trump denies any collusion took place.

-3.5769762373098692," Dominion Atlantic Coast natgas pipe on track for late 2019 start (Reuters) - Dominion Energy Inc said on Wednesday that its $6-$6.5 billion Atlantic Coast natural gas pipeline from West Virginia to Virginia and North Carolina remained on track to enter service in late 2019 after federal regulators approved the start of construction for the project in North Carolina. “Yesterday’s approval was another major step forward for the project and keeps us on track for late 2019 in-service,” Aaron Ruby, a spokesman at Dominion, said in an email. The U.S. Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued that approval in a filing Tuesday afternoon. Like other pipeline approvals, FERC said “if any court or agency invalidates a required federal authorization after construction has begun...(FERC) may take whatever steps are necessary to ensure the protection of environmental resources, including issuance of a stop work order.” The Sierra Club, an environmental group opposing the pipeline, said in a statement following the FERC decision that the project is facing multiple lawsuits and a challenge that could force a rehearing at FERC. The Sierra Club also said the Virginia State Water Control Board is revisiting the sufficiency of the project’s current water certifications, which could be revoked. The 600-mile (966-km) Atlantic Coast project is designed to carry about 1.5 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) of gas from the Marcellus and Utica shale formations in Pennsylvania, West Virginia and Ohio to customers in Virginia and North Carolina. One billion cubic feet of gas is enough to fuel about 5 million U.S. homes for a day. Atlantic Coast is a partnership between units of Virginia energy company Dominion (48 percent), North Carolina’s Duke Energy Corp (47 percent) and Georgia energy company Southern Co (5 percent). Dominion will build and operate the pipe. To feed gas into Atlantic Coast and other pipelines, Dominion also wants to build the 38-mile (61-km) Supply Header project in West Virginia and Pennsylvania at a cost of about $500 million. Atlantic Coast is one of several big pipelines expected to enter service over the next couple of years to connect growing output in the Marcellus and Utica shale basins with customers in other parts of the United States and Canada."
2.8647368547023015," U.S. tax reform reenergizes equity markets for utility companies NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. utility companies in 2018 are selling new stock at the fastest clip in at least a decade after tax reform passed last year left many with a cash-flow shortfall they needed to plug. By the start of June utility companies had issued almost $10 billion of common stock, by far the largest amount for this point in the year since the financial crisis, Thomson Reuters data showed. The need to issue equity highlights how tax reform, viewed by many as a giveaway to corporate America, has come at a price for certain utility companies, diluting the holdings of some shareholders and delivering a hit to credit positions. “In the short term, tax reform has been viewed as credit negative for the utility industry,” said Ann Bulkley, senior vice president at Concentric Energy Advisors, an energy consulting firm. The tax bill, enacted in December, tightened the pace at which some firms can write down past investments. State governments meanwhile responded to the bill by ordering utilities to pass on the tax cuts to customers. For graphic on surge in demand click tmsnrt.rs/2Jtrg9M Both resulted in less cash on hand for some companies to pay for new projects to replace aging infrastructure, industry experts said. ""Tax reform turned the industry on its head,"" said Ray Craig, head of JP Morgan's JPM.N power and utilities equity capital markets. “We’ve seen discrete equity issuance in the sector around M&A activity in the past. This is the first time in years where there have been discrete equity offerings to strengthen the credit metrics and strengthen the balance sheet.” Equity raisings have come so far from the likes of Dominion Energy D.N, Duke Energy DUK.N and Entergy Corp ETR.N. “Given that tax reform has changed the cash flow dynamic, more of the capital expenditure needs will have to be funded by equity than they had previously thought,” Craig said. Not all companies have sold shares to meet cash flow needs. Southern SO.N had the chance to sell some utilities at an attractive price, which had the ancillary effect of boosting cash flow. To be sure, utility companies have welcomed the lower corporate tax rate and the continued ability to deduct an uncapped amount of interest payments from taxable income. Southern Chief Executive Tom Fanning said tax reform overall is a boost. “It gave us a need to raise equity,” said Fanning. “But it’s still great for everybody, it’s great for the customer base, it’s great for the company.”"
3.9766842956491506," RPT-INSIGHT-Billions in U.S. solar projects shelved after Trump panel tariff (Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text) June 7 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s tariff on imported solar panels has led U.S. renewable energy companies to cancel or freeze investments of more than $2.5 billion in large installation projects, along with thousands of jobs, the developers told Reuters. That’s more than double the about $1 billion in new spending plans announced by firms building or expanding U.S. solar panel factories to take advantage of the tax on imports. The tariff’s bifurcated impact on the solar industry underscores how protectionist trade measures almost invariably hurt one or more domestic industries for every one they shield from foreign competition. Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs, for instance, have hurt manufacturers of U.S. farm equipment made with steel, such as tractors and grain bins, along with the farmers buying them at higher prices. White House officials did not respond to a request for comment. Trump announced the tariff in January over protests from most of the solar industry that the move would chill one of America’s fastest-growing sectors. Solar developers completed utility-scale installations costing a total of $6.8 billion last year, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. Those investments were driven by U.S. tax incentives and the falling costs of imported panels, mostly from China, which together made solar power competitive with natural gas and coal. The U.S. solar industry employs more than 250,000 people - about three times more than the coal industry - with about 40 percent of those people in installation and 20 percent in manufacturing, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. “Solar was really on the cusp of being able to completely take off,” said Zoe Hanes, chief executive of Charlotte, North Carolina solar developer Pine Gate Renewables. GTM Research, a clean energy research firm, recently lowered its 2019 and 2020 utility-scale solar installation forecasts in the United States by 20 percent and 17 percent, respectively, citing the levies. Officials at Suniva - a Chinese-owned, U.S.-based solar panel manufacturer whose bankruptcy prompted the Trump administration to consider a tariff - did not respond to requests for comment. Companies with domestic panel factories are divided on the policy. Solar giant SunPower Corp opposes the tariff that will help its U.S. panel factories because it will also hurt its domestic installation and development business, along with its overseas manufacturing operations. “There could be substantially more employment without a tariff,” said Chief Executive Tom Werner. The 30 percent tariff is scheduled to last four years, decreasing by 5 percent per year during that time. Solar developers say the levy will initially raise the cost of major installations by 10 percent. Leading utility-scale developer Cypress Creek Renewables LLC said it had been forced to cancel or freeze $1.5 billion in projects - mostly in the Carolinas, Texas and Colorado - because the tariff raised costs beyond the level where it could compete, spokesman Jeff McKay said. That amounted to about 150 projects at various stages of development that would have employed three thousand or more workers during installation, he said. The projects accounted for a fifth of the company’s overall pipeline. Developer Southern Current has made similar decisions on about $1 billion of projects, mainly in South Carolina, said Bret Sowers, the company’s vice president of development and strategy. “Either you make the decision to default or you bite the bullet and you make less money,” Sowers said. Neither Cypress Creek nor Southern Current would disclose exactly which projects they intend to cancel. They said those details could help their competitors and make it harder to pursue those projects if they become financially viable later. Both are among a group of solar developers that have asked trade officials to exclude panels used in their utility-scale projects from the tariffs. The office of the U.S. Trade Representative said it is still evaluating the requests. Other companies are having similar problems. Scott Canada, senior vice president of renewable energy at solar project builder McCarthy Building Companies, said his company had planned to employ about 1,200 people on solar projects this year but slashed that number by half because of the tariff. Pine Gate, meanwhile, will complete about half of the 400 megawatts of solar installations it had planned this year and has ditched plans to hire 30 permanent employees, Hanes said. The company also withdrew an 80-megawatt project that would have cost up to $150 million from consideration in a bidding process held by Southern Co utility Georgia Power. It pulled the proposal late last year when it learned the Trump administration was contemplating the tariff. “It was just not feasible,” Hanes said. For some developers, the tariff has meant abandoning nascent markets in the American heartland that last year posted the strongest growth in installations. That growth was concentrated in states where voters supported Trump in the 2016 presidential election. South Bend, Indiana-based developer Inovateus Solar LLC, for example, had decided three years ago to focus on emerging Midwest solar markets such as Indiana and Michigan. But the tariff sparked a shift to Massachusetts, where state renewable energy incentives make it more profitable, chairman T.J. Kanczuzewski said. Other developers are forging ahead, keen to take advantage of the remaining years of a 30-percent federal tax credit for solar installation that is scheduled to start phasing out in 2020. Some firms saw the tariff coming and stockpiled panels before Trump’s announcement. 174 Power Global, the development arm of Korea’s Hanwha warehoused 190 megawatts of solar panels at the end of last year for a Texas project that broke ground in January. The company is paying more for panels for two Nevada projects that start operating this year and next, but is moving forward on construction, according to Larry Greene, who heads the firm’s development in the U.S. West. Intersect Power, a developer that cut a deal last year with Austin Energy to provide low-cost power to the Texas capital city, is also pushing ahead, said CEO Sheldon Kimber. But the tariff is forcing delays in buying solar panels. The 150-megawatt project is due to start producing power in 2020. Waiting until the last minute to purchase modules will allow the company to take advantage of the tariff’s 5-percent annual reductions, he said. ‘A LOT OF ROBOTS’ Trump’s tariff has boosted the domestic manufacturing sector as intended, which over time could significantly raise U.S. panel production and reduce prices. Panel manufacturers First Solar and JinkoSolar , for example, have announced plans to spend $800 million on projects to increase panel construction in the United States since the tariff, creating about 700 new jobs in Ohio and Florida. Just last week, Korea’s Hanwha Q CELLS joined them, saying it will open a solar module factory in Georgia next year, though it did not detail job creation. SunPower Corp, meanwhile, purchased U.S. manufacturer SolarWorld’s Oregon factory after the tariff was announced, saving that facility’s 280 jobs. The company said it plans to hire more people at the plant to expand operations, without specifying how many. But SunPower has also said it must cut up to 250 jobs in other parts of its organization because of the tariffs. Jobs in panel manufacturing are also limited due to increasing automation, industry experts said. Heliene - a Canadian company in the process of opening a U.S. facility capable of producing 150 megawatts worth of panels per year - said it will employ between 130 and 140 workers in Minnesota. “The factories are highly automated,” said Martin Pochtaruk, president of Heliene. “You don’t employ too many humans. There are a lot of robots.”"
3.9766842956491506," Billions in U.S. solar projects shelved after Trump panel tariff (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s tariff on imported solar panels has led U.S. renewable energy companies to cancel or freeze investments of more than $2.5 billion in large installation projects, along with thousands of jobs, the developers told Reuters. That’s more than double the about $1 billion in new spending plans announced by firms building or expanding U.S. solar panel factories to take advantage of the tax on imports. The tariff’s bifurcated impact on the solar industry underscores how protectionist trade measures almost invariably hurt one or more domestic industries for every one they shield from foreign competition. Trump’s steel and aluminum tariffs, for instance, have hurt manufacturers of U.S. farm equipment made with steel, such as tractors and grain bins, along with the farmers buying them at higher prices. White House officials did not respond to a request for comment. Trump announced the tariff in January over protests from most of the solar industry that the move would chill one of America’s fastest-growing sectors. Solar developers completed utility-scale installations costing a total of $6.8 billion last year, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. Those investments were driven by U.S. tax incentives and the falling costs of imported panels, mostly from China, which together made solar power competitive with natural gas and coal. The U.S. solar industry employs more than 250,000 people - about three times more than the coal industry - with about 40 percent of those people in installation and 20 percent in manufacturing, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. “Solar was really on the cusp of being able to completely take off,” said Zoe Hanes, chief executive of Charlotte, North Carolina solar developer Pine Gate Renewables. GTM Research, a clean energy research firm, recently lowered its 2019 and 2020 utility-scale solar installation forecasts in the United States by 20 percent and 17 percent, respectively, citing the levies.

7.247904624410485," Florida Power & Light parent adds to Florida assets with $5.1 billion deal (Reuters) - NextEra Energy Inc NEE.N said on Monday it is expanding in Florida by buying some utilities from Southern Co SO.N for $5.08 billion, the latest move in a sector consolidating as heavy debt drags on the industry. Consumers, companies and governments across the United States are looking for ways to be more energy efficient, limiting growth and revenue for many power companies. NextEra, the parent of Florida Power and Light Co, said it would buy almost all of Southern’s assets, including Gulf Power Co and Florida City Gas. Atlanta-based Southern is building the first nuclear power plant in the United States in decades. It plans to use the transaction proceeds to cut debt. Southern had about $44.46 billion in long term debt as of Dec. 31, 2017, according to the latest annual filing. For NextEra, buying Southern’s power and gas assets gives it a bigger foothold in Florida, which is seeing an economic boom. “A key element of the rationale for the transactions are the excellent complementary geographic and strategic fit of both Gulf Power and Florida City Gas with FPL,” Chief Executive Officer James Robo said on a call with investors. Florida Power and Light is the biggest utility in the state. “Compared to many other regions in the U.S., an attractive and expanding Florida economy should benefit Gulf Power and Florida City Gas over the long term,” Robo said. Gulf Power serves around 450,000 customers in eight counties throughout northwest Florida, and has roughly 9,500 miles of power lines and 2,300 megawatts of electric generating capacity. Florida City Gas serves about 110,000 residential and commercial natural-gas customers, and has 3,700 miles of natural gas pipelines. FPL, Gulf Power and Florida City Gas are regulated by the Florida Public Service Commission, which means there are no additional approvals necessary for the deal to go through, Robo said. NextEra expects the deal to add to earnings immediately and intends to finance the transaction by issuing new debt. BofA Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs & Co were financial advisers to NextEra, while Citigroup Global Markets Inc advised Southern Co. Shares of NextEra and Southern were both up nearly 1.5 percent in morning trade on Monday."

U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Sunday the United States and China had agreed to drop their tariff threats on billions of dollars worth of each country’s goods while China on Monday praised a significant dialling back of tensions. That sounded good to stock market investors, who have grown increasingly worried that an outright trade war would hurt the global economy and put an end to Wall Street’s multi-year bull run. “I’m encouraged,” said Robert Pavlik, chief investment strategist and senior portfolio manager at SlateStone Wealth LLC in New York. “People view this trade war “on hold” as a positive. They are going to want to be back in the market.” “Technology, industrials, energy, financials, consumer discretionary are going to benefit today. You may include areas of the market that are involved in trade with China, I think that’s what’s going to help.” The cooling of tensions, though, elicited mixed reactions from U.S. business leaders, with some happy to see the trade spat easing while others said it would be difficult for Washington to rebuild momentum to address what they see as troubling Chinese policies.

6.261629810628698," RPT-FOCUS-Two U.S. coal miners see growth amid sector's gloom (Repeats for additional clients with no changes to text) May 2 (Reuters) - U.S. electric utilities are expected to shut hundreds more of their coal-fired power generators in the coming years, extending a long trend away from coal and toward natural gas that has cast a pall over the mining industry. But not every U.S. coal company sees a bleak future. Ramaco Resources, which produces coal for steel mills, and Consol Energy, which supplies coal to larger power plants, have ramped up investments even as the industry shrinks. President Donald Trump has promised to revive the coal sector by stripping away burdensome regulation. But the two companies say their confidence stems more from market forces than any policy. Their bullish bets illustrate how pockets of profitable growth can survive in troubled industries facing almost certain decline. Ramaco, for example, expects global demand for metallurgical coal to rise in step with economic growth, despite the slump in U.S. demand for the type of coal used in electric power generators. And Consol says it has found a way to turn the rapid decline of coal-fired power into a strength: It has cultivated a clientele that owns big generators that are not expected to shut down anytime soon - making them likely to take over business from rivals that do close. “We can sell every ounce of coal we can produce,” said David Khani, Consol’s Chief Financial Officer. “This isn’t true for everyone.” Consol, which mines thermal coal for power plants in Pennsylvania, boosted capital spending last year by 50 percent to $81.4 million, and it aims to bump that to $125 million in 2018, according to its filings. Ramaco, meanwhile, more than tripled capital expenditures in 2017 to $75 million, making it one of the few coal producers investing in new U.S. mines. The company went public in February 2017 at a tough time for the industry. Those spending increases far outpace the broader sector. Overall, the U.S. coal industry increased capital spending in 2017 by about 27 percent, according to a Reuters analysis of filings from publicly-traded miners - a rebound from years of steep declines, targeted mainly at sustaining operations rather than expanding. Many individual coal firms have cut back capital spending. “They’re spending as much as they need to, to maintain production,” said analyst John Bridges of JP Morgan. U.S. coal production is expected to dip 6 percent in 2018 to 738 million tons, down from 1.17 billion tons a decade ago, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Ramaco’s spending reflects its opening of five new coal mines in the past twelve months in West Virginia, Virginia and Pennsylvania, said Randall Atkins, Ramaco’s executive chairman. The company expects to produce more than 2 million tons of coal in 2018 from less than 600,000 in 2017. The company said the downturn in the U.S. thermal coal industry has little to do with its business. It and other metallurgical coal producers are enjoying robust demand from steel producers around the globe. “Met coal is a proxy for steel, which is in turn a proxy for a nation’s GDP,” Atkins said. “The world finds itself economically in a good place.” He said Trump’s steel tariffs could shift some of the demand for metallurgical coal to the domestic market, but that foreign demand for U.S. exports also remains strong. Ramaco’s share price has been volatile since launching last year. It is trading at about $6.80, up from about $4 late last year after strong earnings estimates. But that’s only about half of its share price last year, in part because one of its new mining projects was delayed. Most miners producing coal for electricity are getting battered, meanwhile, by cheap natural gas and increasingly stringent pollution controls. Consol is betting it can generate hefty profits from a smart play on the downturn. It plans to serve “very large, retrofitted coal plants that compete well against natgas and which are going to be running at a higher capacity as other units are retired,” said CFO Khani. Those plants are currently running at only about 70 percent capacity, he said, providing room for growth. The EIA predicts that coal-fired generators that remain open could operate above 70 percent capacity for decades as other aging plants close. Industry-wide, plants are using less than 60 percent of their capacity now. Consol - whose shares are up to about $31 a share from about $22 late last year - supplies East Coast power generating companies including Dominion, Southern, Duke and DTE.

6.261629810628698," Two U.S. coal miners see growth amid sector's gloom (Reuters) - U.S. electric utilities are expected to shut hundreds more of their coal-fired power generators in the coming years, extending a long trend away from coal and toward natural gas that has cast a pall over the mining industry. But not every U.S. coal company sees a bleak future. Ramaco Resources METC.O, which produces coal for steel mills, and Consol Energy CEIX.N, which supplies coal to larger power plants, have ramped up investments even as the industry shrinks. President Donald Trump has promised to revive the coal sector by stripping away burdensome regulation. But the two companies say their confidence stems more from market forces than any policy. Their bullish bets illustrate how pockets of profitable growth can survive in troubled industries facing almost certain decline. Ramaco, for example, expects global demand for metallurgical coal to rise in step with economic growth, despite the slump in U.S. demand for the type of coal used in electric power generators. And Consol says it has found a way to turn the rapid decline of coal-fired power into a strength: It has cultivated a clientele that owns big generators that are not expected to shut down anytime soon - making them likely to take over business from rivals that do close. “We can sell every ounce of coal we can produce,” said David Khani, Consol’s Chief Financial Officer. “This isn’t true for everyone.” Consol, which mines thermal coal for power plants in Pennsylvania, boosted capital spending last year by 50 percent to $81.4 million, and it aims to bump that to $125 million in 2018, according to its filings. Ramaco, meanwhile, more than tripled capital expenditures in 2017 to $75 million, making it one of the few coal producers investing in new U.S. mines. The company went public in February 2017 at a tough time for the industry. Those spending increases far outpace the broader sector. Overall, the U.S. coal industry increased capital spending in 2017 by about 27 percent, according to a Reuters analysis of filings from publicly-traded miners - a rebound from years of steep declines, targeted mainly at sustaining operations rather than expanding. Many individual coal firms have cut back capital spending. “They’re spending as much as they need to, to maintain production,” said analyst John Bridges of JP Morgan. U.S. coal production is expected to dip 6 percent in 2018 to 738 million tons, down from 1.17 billion tons a decade ago, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Ramaco’s spending reflects its opening of five new coal mines in the past twelve months in West Virginia, Virginia and Pennsylvania, said Randall Atkins, Ramaco’s executive chairman. The company expects to produce more than 2 million tons of coal in 2018 from less than 600,000 in 2017. The company said the downturn in the U.S. thermal coal industry has little to do with its business. It and other metallurgical coal producers are enjoying robust demand from steel producers around the globe. “Met coal is a proxy for steel, which is in turn a proxy for a nation’s GDP,” Atkins said. “The world finds itself economically in a good place.” He said Trump’s steel tariffs could shift some of the demand for metallurgical coal to the domestic market, but that foreign demand for U.S. exports also remains strong. Ramaco’s share price has been volatile since launching last year. It is trading at about $6.80, up from about $4 late last year after strong earnings estimates. But that’s only about half of its share price last year, in part because one of its new mining projects was delayed. Most miners producing coal for electricity are getting battered, meanwhile, by cheap natural gas and increasingly stringent pollution controls. Consol is betting it can generate hefty profits from a smart play on the downturn. It plans to serve “very large, retrofitted coal plants that compete well against natgas and which are going to be running at a higher capacity as other units are retired,” said CFO Khani. Those plants are currently running at only about 70 percent capacity, he said, providing room for growth. The EIA predicts that coal-fired generators that remain open could operate above 70 percent capacity for decades as other aging plants close. Industry-wide, plants are using less than 60 percent of their capacity now. Consol - whose shares are up to about $31 a share from about $22 late last year - supplies East Coast power generating companies including Dominion D.N, Southern SO.N, Duke DUK.N and DTE DTE.N. Both Consol and Ramaco applaud the Trump administration’s pro-coal stance, but their reasons for optimism lie elsewhere. “There has been no game-changing legislation that would allow for increasing domestic demand for U.S. coal,” said Ramaco’s Atkins."
6.553366875344993," RPT-Japan carbon capture site shows promise for industrial use (Repeats item with no changes to text) * Tomakomai test site to store 300,000 T of CO2 by 2020 * Site aims to show CCS can work for industrial uses * Japan CCS says 1 mln T/yr simulation shows method viable By Aaron Sheldrick TOMAKOMAI, Japan, April 19 (Reuters) - A test site in Japan for burying carbon dioxide (CO2) below the seabed off Hokkaido island is showing more promise than other carbon, capture and storage (CCS) projects by cutting costs and increasing efficiency, its developer says. While the $300 million site at Tomakomai port represents a small portion of the $20 billion invested in CCS, it has potential for easing CO2 emissions from industries such as gas processing and cement and chemical production. Most investments into CCS have focused on capturing carbon from power plants fired by coal and other fossil fuels - the largest source of CO2 emissions - but there have been big setbacks and some projects cancelled. “Tomakomai is an exciting development. Progress on CCS has been far too slow and projects like that are very encouraging,” said Graham Winkelman, climate change lead at BHP. Industrial applications such as that being tested at the Tomakomai site are where the focus now is on CCS, he said. BHP is the world’s largest exporter of coal for steel-making, a fuel and industry often marked as big sources of climate-warming emissions. On an exclusive tour of the Tomakomai test site, developers told Reuters they have cut energy costs by as much as two-thirds compared with other projects and increased the efficiency of capturing CO2. Those claims have yet to be tested commercially but the project operated by Japan CCS - owned by Japan Petroleum Exploration, Mitsubishi Corp, JXTG Holdings and more than 30 other companies - looks promising. In contrast, Southern Co’s Kemper power station in the United States was to use CCS in an attempt to get clean power from coal, but was abandoned after billions of dollars of investment. Chevron Corp has also delayed the world’s largest CO2 injection operation in Australia, after spending A$2.5 billion ($2 billion) on the project at its Gorgon liquefied natural gas plant, itself beset by many problems. CCS involves separating CO2 from other materials and gases and injecting it underground to prevent it from escaping into the atmosphere or to use it to create pressure to push oil to the surface as wells deplete. At Tomakomai, by-product gas is piped from a nearby Idemitsu Kosan refinery and CO2 pulled out as it passes through an amine solution. By using the remaining gases to generate power and recycling heat, energy costs are cut to between 1/2 and 1/3 of a typical extraction plant, the company said. When Reuters visited the site, a counter showed 150,000 tonnes of CO2 had been injected, halfway to the project’s targeted 300,000 tonnes. The injection project is scheduled to run until 2020, with no decision yet on commercial operations. Asked about costs, officials declined to state figures. Japan CCS has run simulations scaling the site to handle 1 million tonnes a year and these show it can make commercial sense, said Chiyoko Suzuki, manager of international relations at Japan CCS, during the visit. Australia’s CarbonNet, looking at a similar type of CCS project, last year estimated the cost of compressing, transporting and burying carbon dioxide from gas processing, fertiliser manufacturing and hydrogen production at A$30 ($23.41) a tonne. Suzuki said he did not know CarbonNet’s details so could not make a judgement. CCS will be needed to cut 14 percent of the emissions that have to be abated by 2060 to limit a global rise in average temperatures to less than 2 Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit), the International Energy Agency says.
