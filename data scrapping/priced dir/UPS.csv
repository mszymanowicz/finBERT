33.223246271480264," UPS CEO, fresh off a strong holiday peak, turns to defense (Reuters) -Boosted by an unexpectedly strong end to a tumultuous year, United Parcel Service Inc Chief Executive Carol Tomé is making defensive moves to keep Amazon.com Inc, regional delivery companies and other rivals from stealing customers. Tomé, the first outsider to lead the 114-year-old company, plans to personalize customer pricing and modernize systems like billing and claims to make it easier for customers to do business with the world’s largest parcel delivery firm. “Every morning I wake up looking around corners to see who is trying to get a piece of our pie,” Tomé said in a telephone interview with Reuters. “It would take years, and lots and lots of capital to replicate our network - but little pieces of it, they could come after. So the our question is, ‘How do we make sure that they don’t get that?’,” she said. Earlier on Tuesday, UPS posted a hefty rise in adjusted fourth-quarter profit, resulting from a surge in pandemic-fueled deliveries of online purchases of holiday gifts and staples ranging from food to furniture. UPS shares were up 0.8% to $157.51 in early afternoon trading after jumping 5% at the open. The winter holiday shipping crush at times pushed the Atlanta-based company’s network to its limits. UPS tacked special surcharges on deliveries during the quarter’s peak season, when it was inundated with packages from Amazon and other online retailers - leading to an almost 8% increase in revenue per piece. Amazon, the company’s top customer, accounted for more than 13% of UPS’ business during the fourth quarter. Revenue rose 21% to $24.9 billion, and fourth-quarter adjusted net income increased more than 26% to $2.3 billion, or $2.66 per share. In December, UPS and FedEx Corp started rush deliveries of COVID-19 vaccines to hospitals and health clinics as part of the U.S. government’s Operation Warp Speed project, fueling continued strength in UPS’ specialty healthcare business. Tomé said that work would continue. Tomé, who was a chief financial officer at Home Depot and a longtime UPS board member before taking over as CEO of the package deliverer in June, declined to give revenue or earnings guidance - citing uncertainty around the pace of the vaccine roll-out and the health of economies around the world. “Until we get this pandemic under control, it’s a little bit like walking on Jello,” Tomé said."

8.088149913195162," Special Report-U.S. regulators ignored workers' COVID-19 safety complaints amid deadly outbreaks (Reuters) - Miguel Cabezola, a driver for United Parcel Service Inc in Tucson, Arizona, complained on March 27 to U.S. workplace safety regulators, alleging the company was taking a lax approach to social distancing, sanitizing equipment and quarantining workers with COVID-19 symptoms. He hoped for an inspection of the facility that would force changes to protect worker safety. Instead, the state arm of the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) summarized Cabezola’s concerns in an email to company management, reviewed the UPS response and closed the file. Over the next two months, a COVID-19 outbreak infected more than 40 Tucson UPS workers - including a manager who eventually died - and caused delivery delays throughout southern Arizona, according to interviews with six Tucson UPS workers and local union officials of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. Cabezola’s complaint to the regulator, along with that of another worker in May, had “zero effect,” said Karla Schumann, head of the local Teamsters union representing UPS workers. Asked about the outbreak, UPS expressed regret about the manager’s death and said it has strengthened protocols requiring social distancing and sanitation since the early days of the pandemic. The UPS outbreak is among dozens of cases identified by Reuters where OSHA largely disregarded workers who reported lax pandemic safety practices, according to agency records. Reuters identified the workplace outbreaks through federal, state and local government data and news accounts detailing infections and deaths. The news agency examined the regulatory response through OSHA data on complaints filed by workers and records of resulting inspections. Reuters identified 106 U.S. workplaces where employees complained of slipshod pandemic safety practices around the time of outbreaks - and regulators either never inspected the facilities or, in some cases, waited months to do so, according to the OSHA records. The agency never inspected 70 of those workplaces, where at least 4,500 workers were infected by the coronavirus and 26 died after contracting COVID-19, according to the Reuters analysis. The workers’ regulatory complaints came from a cross-section of companies that included some of America’s best-known firms, including Tesla Inc and Tyson Foods Inc. As of mid-December, just 12 of the 106 facilities have been penalized in response to workers’ complaints. The complaints came from a wide range of workplaces, from meatpacking plants and factories to e-commerce warehouses and nursing homes. Their employees alleged failures to enforce social distancing and mask-wearing; managers pressuring sick employees to work; and a lack of notification to employees about co-workers’ infections. The 106 cases represent a sample of how OSHA has responded to the public health crisis. Reuters was unable to conduct a comprehensive examination of how the agency responded to safety complaints, infections and deaths because most state and local governments do not track or publicize data on workplace outbreaks. UPS spokesman Matt O’Connor said the company’s safety practices have evolved over time as health authorities updated public guidance about COVID-19 and as personal protective equipment became more available after early shortages. The company, he said, had appropriate infection-control protocols in place at the time the manager died. He said UPS takes “swift action” in response to workers’ reports of lax safety practices. The federal agency’s acting leader, Loren Sweatt, said in a statement that the allegations in the cases the news organization cited do not reflect the totality of OSHA’s efforts to keep workers safe and “unfairly disparage dedicated OSHA inspectors across the country.” Trevor Laky, a spokesman for Arizona’s OSHA affiliate, said the agency was not aware of the Tucson UPS manager’s death until Reuters inquired about it in December. All companies are required to report work-related deaths to OSHA. O’Connor, of UPS, said the firm did not report the manager’s death from COVID-19 - amid a workplace outbreak - because its own contact tracing determined that the manager had not been in close contact with infected employees. Laky, of Arizona OSHA, said the agency has no plans to investigate the matter further after UPS told regulators that the death was not work-related. OSHA is the nation’s workplace safety watchdog, tasked with preventing on-the-job injuries and illnesses. Federal OSHA enforces workplace safety in about half of the states, while OSHA-affiliated state agencies carry out those duties in the rest of the country. State OSHA agencies are overseen by state governors and the federal agency and must, at a minimum, enforce federal workplace safety regulations. When OSHA agencies receive worker complaints, officials decide whether to conduct inspections that can lead to fines and requirements to address dangerous working conditions. But regulators never inspected nearly two-thirds of the 106 workplaces where Reuters identified outbreaks, according to the OSHA data on worker complaints and agency workplace inspections. Some of the remaining workplaces received an inspection months after the disease struck, often following negative publicity over outbreaks that sometimes included deaths. Of the 106 workplaces examined by Reuters, 27 had workers who died from COVID-19. OSHA inspected fewer than half of those 27 workplaces - despite agency guidelines saying COVID-19 fatalities should receive top priority. Overall, federal and state OSHA agencies have conducted 44% fewer workplace inspections between March - when coronavirus started to spread widely in the United States - and the end of December, compared to the same period in 2019. The declining inspections came despite what one OSHA official, during congressional testimony in May, called a big increase in worker complaints because of the pandemic. Even in workplaces that OSHA has designated as “high exposure risk” for COVID-19 infection - mostly healthcare facilities - few complaints lead to inspections. OSHA has closed out complaints from about 1,800 hospitals and nursing homes nationwide, but only about 15% of them have been inspected so far during the pandemic, the Reuters review of OSHA data shows. OSHA fined about one in five of those inspected facilities. In a written statement, federal OSHA said that protecting workers from the pandemic is the agency’s “top priority,” and that it has conducted 1,396 COVID-19 inspections as of mid-December in workplaces with more than 618,000 employees. The U.S. agency said it investigates every complaint and has closed out more than 80% of the more than 13,000 COVID-19 complaints it had received through mid-December. That figure does not include the complaints made to state OSHA affiliates. A Reuters review of state and federal OSHA case files on worker complaints, obtained through public records requests, shows those investigations were often cursory and rarely resulted in inspections. Instead, officials typically emailed employers a complaint summary, as they did with UPS, and asked for a response within a week. If the employer responded, the agency closed out the case. Researchers at Harvard University’s school of public health found a correlation between a rise in OSHA complaints in a specific region and a rise in COVID-19 deaths within four weeks in the same area. The peer-reviewed research, published in November, found that OSHA’s failure to respond to such complaints “is a missed opportunity” to stop disease transmission in workplaces and the community at large. The coronavirus pandemic has presented OSHA with a steep challenge in fielding thousands of additional complaints. And OSHA has historically been starved of investigative resources - a trend that continued during the Trump administration. The federal agency currently has fewer inspectors than it did in 1975. Still, some former OSHA officials say the agency’s hands-off response to the pandemic reflects a notable divergence from the past, even compared to prior Republican administrations that also favored a light touch on industry regulation. “This is the sort of workplace crisis that OSHA was invented to address,” said David Michaels, who led the agency during the Obama administration and is now a professor at George Washington University’s school of public health. “OSHA needed to be more forceful and creative to use the tools it has, but it decided not to.” Former OSHA officials, along with public health experts, labor groups and lawmakers, argued beginning in the spring that OSHA should issue an emergency temporary standard requiring employers to follow specific infection-control practices such as mandating social distancing, requiring masks, and removing infected workers while providing them pay. OSHA issued no such standards, which critics say has made it difficult for the agency to hold employers accountable for pandemic-related violations. OSHA said in a statement that it “has the regulatory tools it needs,” citing general standards developed before the pandemic for respiratory protection and personal protective equipment in a wide variety of potentially hazardous situations. But none of the existing standards lay out specifics for handling an infectious disease such as COVID-19. Five current and former OSHA employees told Reuters that the agency never developed an aggressive and focused strategy to respond to the pandemic. An OSHA field employee told Reuters that cases related to the pandemic often get slowed down by multiple layers of approval in regional offices and in Washington. The relatively small number of violations the agency has issued take months to process, the employee said. “I’m not proud of what we’ve done,” the person said. The ineffectiveness reflects an overall neglect of the agency by the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump, the employees said. The administration has left many of the agency’s top leadership positions filled by “acting” managers. OSHA has gone without a Senate-confirmed administrator for Trump’s entire four-year term. “What you’re seeing with COVID is a function of not having a leader,” said Kelly Schnapp, a former director of OSHA’s Office of Science and Technology Assessment, who left the agency in 2019. White House spokesman Judd Deere dismissed the suggestion that U.S. safety regulators had failed to properly address the pandemic. “OSHA’s mission and focus has never wavered: Protecting America’s workers on the job,” he said in a statement. Out of 1,396 federal OSHA inspections related to COVID-19, the agency has issued citations from 273 of those cases through mid-December, averaging about $13,000 each. That includes fines for meat-packing giants Smithfield Foods Inc and JBS USA, which have had severe outbreaks. Smithfield received a penalty of $13,494 for a violation at its Sioux Falls, South Dakota plant, where four workers died and nearly 1,300 workers were infected. JBS’ citation was for $15,615 at its Greeley, Colorado plant, where six died and 292 tested positive. Both companies are appealing the fines. Some of the federal OSHA citations came with no fines at all. The largest penalty ever issued by OSHA was an $81.3 million fine to BP Products North America Inc in 2009, following a 2005 refinery explosion in Texas that killed 15 workers and injured 170 more. In late September, OSHA weakened its guidelines for when employers must notify the agency about workers who are hospitalized with COVID-19. Previously, employers were required to notify OSHA of all “work-related” hospitalizations of employees with COVID-19. Then the agency changed its guidance to require notification only in cases where an employee is hospitalized “within 24 hours of an exposure” to the coronavirus at work. The guidance gutted the notification requirement for two reasons: Coronavirus symptoms - much less hospitalizations - do not occur within 24 hours of virus exposure, according to public health experts, and the exact moment of infection is impossible to determine. Since the new guidelines were announced, OSHA data shows, the average number of reported hospitalizations since October were 40% less than the average number reported from late March through September. The numbers have remained low despite the uncontrolled spread of the virus through much of the country over the last two months. OSHA acknowledged to Reuters that employers are unlikely to report COVID-19 hospitalizations under the revised reporting rules. But it denied changing the rules, saying it was only clarifying existing regulations. Michaels, the former OSHA leader under Obama, is now on President-elect Joe Biden’s COVID-19 task force. He said the weakened reporting standards make it that much harder for OSHA to identify dangerous workplaces. “By deciding to collect less information, OSHA then has less ability to respond,” he said. Biden pledged during the campaign to strengthen workplace standards for controlling the virus, and to boost the number of OSHA inspectors. In Las Vegas - which has hosted millions of tourists during the pandemic - workers at 25 different resorts across the city sent more than 60 complaints to Nevada OSHA about lax virus safety protocols between June and September. To date, Nevada OSHA has conducted one COVID-19-related inspection of a Vegas casino - the Aria Resort. The case, prompted by a complaint about inadequate enforcement of mask-wearing and social distancing, is still open. MGM Resorts International, which operates Aria, declined to comment on the inspection but said it has strong health and safety measures. Workers at the Cosmopolitan casino filed complaints to Nevada OSHA seven times from June through August, alleging that the hotel wasn’t following state mandates on requiring guests to wear masks and keeping the casino at half capacity. Employees also alleged managers pressured them to work despite unsafe conditions. “Employees have been informed that if they refuse to take a shift, they will then be terminated,” read one complaint from late August. “Over 70 employees have tested positive and have quickly returned to working.” The Cosmopolitan did not answer questions about the total number of infected employees, and county health officials said they do not track workplace outbreaks. A state report from last summer, however, showed the Cosmopolitan ranked highest on a list of possible exposure points to COVID-19 in southern Nevada between June and July, based on interviews with those who were infected. At the D Las Vegas casino, a worker complained in July that “fifty percent of the employees at the D have tested positive,” yet “the employer is not notifying potentially exposed employees.” Representatives of the Cosmopolitan and the D Las Vegas said they have strict health and safety protocols in place to protect workers and guests. The Cosmopolitan said they worked with Nevada OSHA to investigate COVID-19 complaints and have received no citations. Angela Ciciriello, a spokeswoman for the D Las Vegas, said many of the complaints came earlier in the year, when the industry was still working through safety protocols for guests and workers. “It was an evolving process, and I think we handled it the best we could,” she said. Nevada’s OSHA affiliate also has not inspected Tesla Inc’s mammoth battery factory near Reno, where workers complained of unsafe conditions between March and November. In a September report, county health authorities found that 117 COVID-19 cases since June were linked to the facility, which is a joint venture between Tesla and Panasonic Corp of North America. Tesla workers complained nine times to OSHA about pandemic-related issues, and Panasonic workers filed 10 complaints. Tesla workers said in complaints that groups of four to five workers were required to remain in close proximity to maintain production, and that mask wearing wasn’t being enforced. “People are working and have COVID-19,” read a Tesla worker’s complaint from late July. Tesla managers were aware of the illnesses and required employers to work anyway, the complaint alleged. Nevada OSHA has not conducted an inspection of the facility. Teri Williams, a spokeswoman for Nevada OSHA, did not answer questions about the agency’s handling of workers’ complaints about the casinos and the battery factory. She said in a statement that the agency “has had to accomplish a tremendous amount of work with a small but dedicated staff” during the pandemic. Tesla did not respond to requests for comment. Panasonic spokeswoman Dannea DeLisser said in a statement that the company investigated all complaints related to the factory and has “robust” health and safety protocols for its employees. At Tyson Foods Inc, testing in late April revealed nearly 900 employees in Logansport, Indiana, had contracted COVID-19. Workers at the pork-processing facility had flagged problems weeks before the outbreak. Workers sent in 13 complaints to OSHA, detailing what one filing described as “packed” working conditions, a lack of protective gear and people with fevers continuing to show up for shifts. Indiana OSHA never inspected the site for COVID-19 problems, and it closed the complaints after getting documents from the company in response to agency emails. The state agency said in a statement that all but two of the complaints were anonymous, which made it difficult to follow up with workers. The agency said Tyson provided documents showing that the company worked to slow the spread of COVID-19. Gary Harris, 62, a loading dock worker at the Tyson hog processing plant in Logansport, said workers were left in the dark for weeks about the extent of the virus. Most workers started raising alarms to management when they noticed how many people were absent. “They just started coming up missing, and that grew the fear,” Harris said. Cass County - the rural stretch surrounding the Logansport facility - went from having few COVID-19 cases to recording among the highest number in the state by late April. Harris called the Tyson plant a “superspreader” and said there was friction between Tyson workers and others in the community, who blamed the workers for the spread. Tyson did not answer questions from Reuters about its workers’ OSHA complaints, but said it has invested $540 million since April in safety improvements across all its U.S. plants, including temperature checks, health screenings, random testing and plexiglass dividers for workstations. The company said it has worked closely with local health officials and OSHA, and has “consistently met or exceeded guidance” from health authorities. ‘AVOIDABLE’ OUTBREAK In the two months after UPS driver Cabezola complained to OSHA on March 27, the virus quickly spread throughout the facility. Managers often failed to inform employees who had worked near infected colleagues, said Carlos Toledo, a Teamsters union representative for the Tucson facility. “The outbreak we had was avoidable,” said Mike Sanchez, a worker who was out sick for three months due to complications from the virus. UPS spokesman O’Connor said the company consistently told workers to stay home if they were sick and that it has appropriately informed employees about coworkers’ infections - assertions that were disputed by two UPS workers and two union officials. Workers said UPS only started enforcing mask-wearing requirements and taking other precautions after taking criticisms from the union in local media and after a manager, Dan Amaro, died of COVID-19 in June. But those efforts have gotten more lax in recent months, said employee Nick Quijada. “They’ve definitely let it slide,” he said. Arizona OSHA officials have still not inspected or visited the UPS facility, and the agency told Reuters it has no plans to do so."

In a September report, county health authorities found that 117 COVID-19 cases since June were linked to the facility, which is a joint venture between Tesla and Panasonic Corp (6752.T) of North America. Tesla workers complained nine times to OSHA about pandemic-related issues, and Panasonic workers filed 10 complaints. Tesla workers said in complaints that groups of four to five workers were required to remain in close proximity to maintain production, and that mask wearing wasn't being enforced. ""People are working and have COVID-19,"" read a Tesla worker's complaint from late July. Tesla managers were aware of the illnesses and required employers to work anyway, the complaint alleged. Nevada OSHA has not conducted an inspection of the facility. Teri Williams, a spokeswoman for Nevada OSHA, did not answer questions about the agency's handling of workers' complaints about the casinos and the battery factory. She said in a statement that the agency ""has had to accomplish a tremendous amount of work with a small but dedicated staff"" during the pandemic. Tesla did not respond to requests for comment. Panasonic spokeswoman Dannea DeLisser said in a statement that the company investigated all complaints related to the factory and has ""robust"" health and safety protocols for its employees. COMING TO WORK SICK At Tyson Foods Inc, testing in late April revealed nearly 900 employees in Logansport, Indiana, had contracted COVID-19. Workers at the pork-processing facility had flagged problems weeks before the outbreak. Workers sent in 13 complaints to OSHA, detailing what one filing described as ""packed"" working conditions, a lack of protective gear and people with fevers continuing to show up for shifts. Indiana OSHA never inspected the site for COVID-19 problems, and it closed the complaints after getting documents from the company in response to agency emails. The state agency said in a statement that all but two of the complaints were anonymous, which made it difficult to follow up with workers. The agency said Tyson provided documents showing that the company worked to slow the spread of COVID-19. Gary Harris, 62, a loading dock worker at the Tyson hog processing plant in Logansport, said workers were left in the dark for weeks about the extent of the virus. Most workers started raising alarms to management when they noticed how many people were absent. ""They just started coming up missing, and that grew the fear,"" Harris said. Cass County - the rural stretch surrounding the Logansport facility - went from having few COVID-19 cases to recording among the highest number in the state by late April. Harris called the Tyson plant a ""superspreader"" and said there was friction between Tyson workers and others in the community, who blamed the workers for the spread. Tyson did not answer questions from Reuters about its workers' OSHA complaints, but said it has invested $540 million since April in safety improvements across all its U.S. plants, including temperature checks, health screenings, random testing and plexiglass dividers for workstations. The company said it has worked closely with local health officials and OSHA, and has ""consistently met or exceeded guidance"" from health authorities. 'AVOIDABLE' OUTBREAK In the two months after UPS driver Cabezola complained to OSHA on March 27, the virus quickly spread throughout the facility. Managers often failed to inform employees who had worked near infected colleagues, said Carlos Toledo, a Teamsters union representative for the Tucson facility. ""The outbreak we had was avoidable,"" said Mike Sanchez, a worker who was out sick for three months due to complications from the virus. UPS spokesman O'Connor said the company consistently told workers to stay home if they were sick and that it has appropriately informed employees about coworkers' infections - assertions that were disputed by two UPS workers and two union officials. Workers said UPS only started enforcing mask-wearing requirements and taking other precautions after taking criticisms from the union in local media and after a manager, Dan Amaro, died of COVID-19 in June. But those efforts have gotten more lax in recent months, said employee Nick Quijada. ""They've definitely let it slide,"" he said. Arizona OSHA officials have still not inspected or visited the UPS facility, and the agency told Reuters it has no plans to do so."
-1.770645133129834," U.S. vaccine campaign launches with first shipments 'delivering hope' to millions (Reuters) -Cargo planes and trucks with the first U.S. shipments of coronavirus vaccine fanned out from FedEx and UPS hubs in Tennessee and Kentucky on Sunday en route to distribution points around the country, launching an immunization project of unprecedented scope and complexity. The inoculations, seen as pivotal to ultimately halting a surging pandemic that is claiming more than 2,400 U.S. lives a day, could begin as early as Monday. The first are likely to be at vaccination sites closest to any of the 145 initial shipment destinations nationwide, or those nearest the FedEx Corp or United Parcel Service cargo centers that are relaying deliveries from the factory. Governor Andy Beshear of Kentucky suggested the very first injections of the vaccine will be given in his state, home to the UPS Worldport sorting facility in Louisville - one of two distribution command centers. The other is the FedEx air cargo hub in Memphis, Tennessee. “We now believe that the first individuals will be vaccinated here in the commonwealth tomorrow morning. We are less than 24 hours away from the beginning of the end of this virus,” Beshear wrote on Twitter on Sunday. The coronavirus vaccine, developed by Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech, gained emergency-use approval from federal regulators late on Friday, clearing the way for distribution to begin a mere 11 months after the United States documented its first COVID-19 infections. The monumental undertaking began early on Sunday with trucks carrying dry ice-cooled packages of vaccine - which must be kept at sub-Arctic temperatures - from Pfizer’s facility in Kalamazoo, Michigan, to UPS and FedEx planes waiting at air fields in Lansing and Grand Rapids. From there, the delivery jets whisked the shipments to UPS and FedEx’s respective cargo hubs in Louisville and Memphis, for distribution on planes and trucks to the first 145 of 636 vaccine-staging areas across the country. A second and third waves of vaccine shipments were due to go out to the remaining sites on Tuesday and Wednesday. “Today, we’re not hauling freight, we’re delivering hope,” said Andrew Boyle, co-president of Boyle Transportation, which was hired by UPS to help ferry vaccine from the factory to a waiting plane in Lansing. The precious cargo was escorted to airports by body-armor-clad security officers. Boyle employee Bonnie Brewer, 56, said decades of experience hauling chemotherapies and other life-saving drugs prepared her for the historic run. “It feels amazing,” Brewer told Reuters after the cargo was safely handed off. Healthcare workers and elderly residents of long-term care homes will be first in line to get the inoculations of a two-dose regimen given about three weeks apart. Public health officials have warned Americans not to become complacent about wearing masks and avoiding crowds in the meantime. More than 100 million people, or about 30% of the U.S. population, could be immunized by the end of March, U.S. Operation Warp Speed chief adviser Dr Moncef Slaoui said in an interview with Fox News Sunday. That would still leave the country far short of herd immunity that would halt virus transmission, so masks and social distancing will be needed for months to control the rampaging outbreak. Health officials will also have to overcome widespread hesitancy about the new vaccines, with many Americans concerned the record speed at which they were developed may have compromised safety. “It is however critical that most of the American people decide and accept to take the vaccine,” Slaoui said. “We are very concerned by the hesitancy that we see.” The massive logistical effort is further complicated by the need to transport and store the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine at minus 70 Celsius (minus 94 Fahrenheit), requiring enormous quantities of dry ice or specialized ultra-cold freezers. Workers clapped and whistled as the first boxes were loaded onto trucks at the Pfizer factory. The long-awaited moment comes as the U.S. death toll was approaching 300,000 and infections and hospitalizations set daily records. Some models project that deaths could reach 500,000 before vaccines become widely available in the spring and summer. (Graphic: tmsnrt.rs/34pvUyi) Slaoui said the United States hopes to have about 40 million vaccine doses - enough for 20 million people - distributed by the end of December. That would include vaccines from both Pfizer and Moderna Inc. An outside FDA advisory panel is scheduled to consider the Moderna vaccine on Thursday, with emergency use expected to be granted shortly after. The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine was found to be 95% effective in preventing illness in a large clinical trial. It is not yet known if it prevents infection or transmission of the coronavirus. UPS and FedEx package delivery drivers are giving the vaccine priority over holiday gifts and other parcels, as health officials plead with the public to avoid holiday gatherings following a post-Thanksgiving spike in hospitalizations and deaths. Both companies have expertise handling fragile medical products and are leaving little room for error. They are providing temperature and location tracking to backup devices embedded in the Pfizer boxes, and tracking each shipment throughout its journey."

The largest U.S. package delivery companies are partners in the federal government’s Operation Warp Speed (OWS) vaccine program and each has specialized capabilities to handle fragile medical products - including Pfizer Inc’s mRna vaccine that requires shipment at sub-Arctic temperatures. “We’re giving priority to all the vaccine shipments,” Wesley Wheeler, president of the global healthcare unit at UPS, told the U.S. Senate Committee on Commerce, Science & Transportation on Thursday.

If the vaccine is approved, UPS will put Gold-level service labels, which are embedded with four radios, on every vaccine and dry ice shipment. UPS GPS trackers will also provide temperature, light exposure and motion data, backing up sensors provided by Pfizer. All of that information will stream into command centers run by UPS and OWS. “We have three ways of looking at the packages through the system,” said Wheeler. “We are watching the packages all day long.” UPS will load the suitcase-sized vaccine packages onto planes and trucks first and give them special handling in hubs and sorting centers. The company also will inform drivers who are transporting vaccines, and provide security escorts. Vaccine distribution could start just as the U.S. holiday shipping peak hits record-pandemic fueled e-commerce volumes. Some experts are already warning that the number of packages tendered for delivery could be 5% greater than the capacity carriers have to handle them - resulting is as many as 700 million gifts not arriving on time. UPS and FedEx executives said they are giving vaccines top priority and have reserved capacity for them. Before vaccine deliveries start, UPS will deliver supplies needed to administer Pfizer inoculations - including diluent, mixing vials, needles, syringes, protective equipment for healthcare workers and COVID-19 vaccination record cards for vaccine recipients. The delivery companies will split next-day Pfizer vaccine deliveries in the United States, and UPS will deliver the first dry ice refills needed to keep vaccine in Pfizer’s suitcase-sized shipping boxes at minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94°F), Wheeler said. Dr. Rachel Levine, Pennsylvania’s secretary of health and the president of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officers, said in prepared remarks that a quarter of states experienced a lag in receiving supply kits during a dry run. “You’re going to have three different components ... that all need to arrive at the exact same place, at the right time so that the vaccine can be administered,” Levine said at the hearing.

Richard Smith, a vice president at FedEx Express, said his company has been “hardening” its network to protect shipments from cyber attack but did not say whether it had experienced any problems. Republican Senator Deb Fischer, who chaired the hearing, said IBM had identified phishing email attacks. She asked FedEx and United Parcel Service executives whether their companies or employees had been the target of cyber attacks. Wesley Wheeler, president of UPS’ Global Healthcare, said, “We are not in a position to say that today,” but added that broadly, the company is the target of “attacks every day” and that it has an “incredibly tight email system.”"
-2.7053707822411117," FedEx says it has ample air capacity for vaccines LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - FedEx Corp - and its rival United Parcel Service Inc - have enough air cargo capacity handle COVID-19 vaccine deliveries, FedEx Americas President Richard Smith said on Tuesday. FedEx and UPS are key partners to the U.S. government’s Operation Warp Speed vaccine project and will move millions of doses for Pfizer Inc and other pharmaceutical companies. Experts predict that the unprecedented size of the COVID-19 project will test the nation’s cold-chain shipping capabilities. “There’s plenty of capacity in our networks to handle this, and remember it’s not all going to hit us on a Tuesday,” Smith said during the Operation Warp Speed vaccine summit at the White House. “It’s going to come over time, so we’ve got this. Relax,” Smith said, also referring to UPS. Accenture’s Seabury Consulting estimates the global roll-out of a vaccine will generate 65,000 tonnes of air freight, which is five times the air vaccine trade in 2019."
1.572106509790494," UPS beats profit expectations but shares sink on e-commerce margin squeeze (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc's UPS.N quarterly profit beat expectations on Wednesday, but shares sank 5.5% as investors fretted over a margin squeeze from pandemic-fueled e-commerce deliveries. The results from the world's largest delivery firm arrived as UPS, FedEx Corp FDX.N and other major package carriers get an early start to a holiday shipping rush that is certain to stress networks already running at near capacity. “While we expect this holiday season to have its challenges, we are ready to deliver a successful peak,” Chief Executive Officer Carol Tomé said on a conference call with analysts. Third-quarter average daily volume jumped 13.8% in the key domestic segment at UPS, which has been inundated with residential deliveries ranging from exercise equipment to snacks. Domestic package operating profit fell 8.8% on an increase in deliveries to far-flung - and less profitable - residential addresses and investments to expand and speed up service. The pandemic helped drive higher turnover, which dented productivity during the quarter. “Continued compression in domestic margins means that the debate over whether UPS has ‘fixed’ e-commerce remains open,” Bernstein analyst David Vernon said in a note. Atlanta-based UPS has raised prices and slashed costs in a bid to shelter earnings from a drop in lucrative shipments to businesses. The company plans to hire more than 100,000 workers for the winter holiday season. U.S. retailers started Christmas promotions more than a month early to avoid overwhelming the delivery network. UPS and its rivals are limiting the number of packages they accept from some customers. Third-quarter net income at UPS increased 11.8% to $1.96 billion, or $2.24 per share. Excluding items, UPS earned $2.28 per share, beating analysts’ average estimate of $1.90 per share, according to Refinitiv data. Revenue jumped 15.9% to $21.24 billion.

6.100998564431023," Exclusive: UPS, FedEx warn they cannot carry ballots like U.S. Postal Service LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - United Parcel Service and FedEx on Friday shot down social media calls that they step in to deliver mail-in ballots from the U.S. Postal Service, which is warning states of potentially “significant” delays. “State ballots must be postmarked to be considered valid and only the USPS has lawful postmarking status. Therefore UPS, FedEx and other private parties cannot technically be involved in shipping ballots,” UPS told Reuters in a statement. “FedEx does accept individual ballots, and we advise that customers planning to return their ballots via FedEx should closely review their state’s guidelines on absentee voting and deadlines for ballots or related election documents,” FedEx said. Republican President Donald Trump on Thursday said he opposed providing funds for the struggling Postal Service for mail voting, which is expected to surge to 50% as the coronavirus pandemic rages ahead of the Nov. 3 presidential election. The Postal Service said on Friday it has written to 46 states and the District of Columbia warning there is a significant risk voters will not have enough time to complete and return their ballots. In a viral Twitter post here on Thursday, author and radio host David Rothkopf said there was a ""big opportunity"" for UPS and FedEx to deliver ballots for free. ""You'll overnight become the most beloved and respected organization in America,"" he wrote. Various laws and regulations for the most part prohibit private delivery companies from handling mail-in and absentee ballots, the companies and experts told Reuters. Exceptions include deliveries deemed “extremely urgent” by statute and deliveries on the day of and afternoon prior to election day. In some states, collection would be prohibited because it would be considered “ballot harvesting,” said Tammy Patrick, a former Arizona election official and senior advisor to the Democracy Fund foundation. There are other hurdles that those companies, already coping with a pandemic-related surge in e-commerce shipments, would have to overcome. For example, the Postal Service touches every U.S. mailbox six days a week. Private companies visit only when they have a delivery or an pre-arranged pickup - and they do not have blanket coverage in rural areas. Amazon.com’s upstart delivery service has also been floated as an alternative. That service does not do residential pickups. Representatives from Amazon and the Postal Service did not immediately respond to requests for comment. “Establishing a protocol of how they would collect the ballots would be a challenge,” Patrick said. Domestic costs would skyrocket since delivery firms charge significantly more for deliveries than the price of a 55-cent stamp, which is the cost to return many ballots. And, international costs would be “astronomical,” Patrick said."
7.551455915765079," UPS plans heavy holiday fees amid coronavirus-related shipment surge (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc plans to impose big fees on large shippers sending significantly more packages through its system during the holiday season amid the coronavirus pandemic, according to a new fee schedule released on Friday. The novel coronavirus outbreak has disrupted operations at UPS and other large delivery firms - swamping their networks with everything from food to furniture, while putting the brakes on profit-making shipments between businesses. UPS said the new fees could total as much as $3 a package for ground shipments and other lower-priced shipping options and up to $4 a package for air shipments bound for residences. The hikes were first reported by the Wall Street Journal. UPS said the surcharges will apply from mid-November until mid-January and are designed to apply only to customers who ship more than 25,000 packages a week. The charges escalate as customers send 110%, 200% and 300% more shipments than their average weekly shipping volume in February. “This could be the last we see of free shipping,” said Cathy Morrow Roberson, founder of Logistics Trends & Insights. She said the price increases are yet another blow to struggling retailers, who have seen store sales plummet during the pandemic. Higher holiday shipping costs could force them absorb the extra fees, stop subsidizing free shipping, or raise prices. UPS declined to say what percentage of their customers would be affected. Amazon.com, the largest customer of UPS and a rising delivery rival, declined to comment. UPS and rivals FedEx Corp and DHL each have taken steps to manage the boom in lower-margin, e-commerce deliveries, which has required them to add labor and secure more space on planes, trucks and trains. The U.S. Postal Service, which also delivers large numbers of packages, also is grappling with a significant surge in volume. “They don’t have an infinite amount of capacity,” Morrow Roberson said of U.S. package carriers."
11.770740531852164," UPS shares hit new high as pandemic drives healthcare, e-commerce shipments (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc UPS.N exceeded analyst estimates for quarterly profit and revenue on Thursday as pandemic-fueled rises in lucrative healthcare and air shipments helped offset a margin squeeze from surging e-commerce home deliveries, sending shares up as much as 17.6%. The novel coronavirus outbreak has disrupted operations at UPS and other large delivery firms - accelerating shipments of everything from face masks and medical equipment to food and furniture, while putting the brakes on profit-making shipments between businesses. Atlanta-based UPS is raising prices, containing costs and focusing investment on projects that extend and speed up service as it manages economic uncertainty - particularly in the United States, where COVID-19 deaths are spiking, unemployment benefits could shrink, and a consequential presidential election looms in November. “The fact that margins compressed so little on 65% growth in residential deliveries is encouraging,” Bernstein analyst David Vernon said. UPS shares were up nearly 15% at $142.37, after earlier hitting a record high of $145.50. Shares in rival FedEx Corp FDX.N also benefited, gaining nearly 3%. Average U.S. daily volumes jumped 22.8% to 21.1 million daily packages during the second quarter. But that came at a cost. Dropping packages on residential doorsteps is less profitable than delivering to businesses, as it requires more truck miles and stops per route. Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O, its largest customer and a rising logistics competitor, drove much of that growth. UPS also grabbed more air cargo from Asia, in part due to rival FedEx Corp's FDX.N split with Amazon last summer, and fetched sky-high rates for the service. Net income rose 4.9% to $1.77 billion in the quarter, boosted in part by lower fuel prices. Earnings excluding items were $2.13 per share, beating analysts average estimate of $1.07 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Revenue also outpaced Wall Street’s target, growing 13.4% to hit $20.46 billion. In her first conference call since becoming chief executive at UPS on June 1, Carol Tomé said she would invest through the crisis to position the company for growth in the recovery. Tomé, a long-time UPS director and former Home Depot Inc HD.N chief financial officer, is the first outsider to lead the more than 100-year-old company. UPS faces ongoing margin pressure in its core domestic business and Nate Fischer, chief investment strategist at Strategic Wealth Partners, expects Tomé to wring out costs and attack challenges in new ways. “She is the right CEO for this company,” he said."

47.45502107268935," TuSimple starts self-driving truck network with UPS, Berkshire Hathaway's McLane (Reuters) - U.S. technology company TuSimple on Wednesday launched a self-driving freight network with UPS and Berkshire Hathaway Inc supply chain unit McLane that it said should operate nationwide by 2024 and start running some driverless trucks routes by 2021. United Parcel Service Inc and McLane, which serves convenience stores, mass merchants, drug stores and chain restaurants, already run some shorter test routes with TuSimple. UPS, which bought a minority stake in TuSimple last year, will add a fresh route in the next few weeks, a spokeswoman for TuSimple said by phone. Trucking firm US Xpress Enterprises Inc has signed up to start using TuSimple’s network soon, she said. UPS, the world’s largest package delivery company, is betting that autonomous vehicle technology can expand more rapidly in commercial vehicles than in robotaxis. Freight routes are far more predictable than robotaxis, as trucks run between fixed points that are easy to map. TuSimple executives liken their network to a railroad, with trucks following set routes like rails between those fixed points. By 2021, TuSimple’s network should cover fixed routes between a cluster of southwestern U.S. cities - Phoenix and Tucson in Arizona; and El Paso, Dallas, Houston and San Antonio in Texas. Those routes consist almost exclusively of major highways. TuSimple already operates on seven routes between Phoenix, Tucson, El Paso and Dallas. TuSimple currently uses a driver and engineer on each truck. By 2023, TuSimple aims to offer service between Los Angeles and Jacksonville, Florida. And by 2024 the company wants to run driverless operations on major shipping routes around the country and is banking on the federal government to come up with a regulatory framework for self-driving freight vehicles by then."
50.82888318090284," COVID-19 delivery surge strains FedEx service, opening doors for UPS LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A months-long flood of coronavirus-related e-commerce packages is straining service FedEx Corp FDX.N, giving rival United Parcel Service Inc UPS.N an opportunity to steal market share, customers and consultants told Reuters. While every U.S. package carrier is fighting to manage unexpected demand for home deliveries of bicycles, patio furniture, medicine and food, FedEx entered the pandemic in turnaround mode and is grappling with an inflexible business structure that is contributing to service disruptions in California and Michigan. FedEx reports quarterly results after the market close on Tuesday. Reuters could not immediately determine whether it is suffering similar delays in other states. For two Mondays in a row, FedEx told San Bernardino, California-based Pacific Mountain Logistics it would not make scheduled Ground pickups until Thursday, Chief Executive B.J. Patterson said. The delay is not limited to FedEx’s Ground division that focuses on e-commerce packages. Service at FedEx Express - which caters mostly to business deliveries - also is affected, said Patterson, who has been a FedEx customer for a decade. In an email viewed by Reuters, a FedEx Services account representative cited a “lack of equipment” and a “backlog” at the delivery company’s Rialto, California, hub. A corporate spokeswoman, who did not elaborate on the reasons for the delays, said FedEx Ground is experiencing holiday “peak-like levels” of residential demand. “All these guys got caught flat-footed with the volume increase,” Patterson said, referring to pandemic package surges at U.S. delivery firms. “I get it. But to not be able to handle it for almost a week, that’s a little insane,” said Patterson, who is moving some shipments to UPS. The volume surge also is causing “significant” FedEx Ground delays in parts of Michigan, according company service alerts. Cathy Morrow Roberson, founder of consulting services at Logistics Trends & Insights, said it appears to have started in late May. WDIV-TV reported that FedEx was addressing Detroit-area delays by hiring package handlers and drivers, and diverting packages from its Oak Park facility. The pandemic is blurring the lines between FedEx's distinct Ground and Express businesses. It is also heaping additional operational challenges on company executives, who already were wrestling with last summer's split with Amazon.com AMZN.O, a major customer, and the problem-plagued TNT Express merger in Europe. Business closures forced FedEx to reroute deliveries from shuttered offices to workers’ homes, said Trevor Outman, founder of San Diego-based consultancy Shipware. FedEx responded to the coronavirus spike by putting caps on the numbers of FedEx Ground packages customers could send. That prompted Patterson and others to shift some excess volume to the pricier Express network. Over the years, FedEx got kudos for outsourcing costly Ground deliveries to lower-cost contractors. But now experts say the pandemic is highlighting the competitive advantage of UPS’s single package network. That unified model is more efficient and “allows UPS to manage unplanned volume better,” said Dean Maciuba, a former FedEx executive. Chase Flashman, CEO of consultancy ShipSights, said the disruptions open the door for UPS to woo FedEx customers, much in the way the 1997 UPS strike left an opening for FedEx. “They’re going to gain some market share,” Flashman said of UPS. “It won’t be a short-term shift.”"
63.85311751358505," UPS adds 'peak' surcharge amid coronavirus fueled delivery spike LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc UPS.N on May 31 will slap surcharges on U.S. e-commerce companies that have flooded its delivery network with shipments of everything from packaged food to patio furniture since the coronavirus took hold in March. Such fees are common during the winter holiday season, when package volumes more than double. This round follows stay-at-home orders to fight the spread of the novel coronavirus. That public health effort shifted shopping online and resulted in what many are calling a ""second Christmas"" for UPS, FedEx Corp FDX.N and upcoming delivery rival Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O. The new fees will hit large, high-volume shippers and companies that send oversized items. It could drive up costs at a time when many retailers are fighting to shelter profits. Amazon, its biggest client, and the online divisions of Walmart Inc WMT.N and Target Corp TGT.N have seen sales surge since shoppers have hunkered down at home during the pandemic. That spike in home deliveries is raising costs at UPS. In April, UPS said home deliveries accounted for roughly 70% of shipments versus around 50% previously. Dropping packages on residential doorsteps is less lucrative than delivering to businesses because it requires more truck miles and stops per route. FedEx recently said it would cap the number of parcels customers could send directly from stores."

30.035530941606435," UPS slashes investment, buybacks amid coronavirus disruption (This April 28 story corrects to show that FedEx did not participate in the CARES Act) (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc UPS.N will slash $1 billion from this year's capital spending budget and reduce planned share buybacks by almost $800 million as it adjusts to ""unprecedented"" changes wrought by the novel coronavirus outbreak. Shares sank 5% to $97.47 in midday trading after the world’s biggest package delivery company, like dozens of other major firms, withdrew its financial 2020 forecasts after missing analyst estimates for profit in the first quarter. UPS is under pressure to squeeze more profit out of booming e-commerce shipments as Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O looms as a double threat. The e-commerce giant is UPS's largest customer and is building a rival delivery network. UPS is prioritizing projects that help it run more efficiently, said Chief Executive David Abney, who will hand leadership of the 113-year-old company to former Home Depot HD.N executive Carol Tomé on June 1. Dividends remain a high priority, executives said. During the first quarter, U.S. average daily package volume rose 8.5% and domestic Next Day Air volume surged 20.5% - bolstered in part by a split between rival FedEx Corp FDX.N and Amazon. Government stay-at-home orders in mid-March sparked a boom in home deliveries of everything from food to exercise equipment. Those deliveries are less lucrative than business deliveries because they require more truck miles and stops per route. UPS shipments have gone from an equal mix of home and business deliveries to roughly 70% residential and 30% business deliveries, Abney told Reuters. We “don’t know that we’ll ever get back to what we’d call the old normal, but we’re not ready to declare what we see today as a new normal either,” Abney said. International average daily volume fell 1.8% during the first quarter. China volumes in March rebounded from sharp drops in January and February. Robust demand for personal protective equipment (PPE) and other healthcare shipments helped drive the recovery. UPS has been scrambling planes around the world to match swiftly changing demand, Abney said: “It’s musical chairs, only with aircraft.” First-quarter net income fell 13% to $965 million, or $1.11 per share, including charges related to making UPS’s network faster and expanding weekend deliveries. Excluding items, the Atlanta-based company earned $1.15 per share, missing the average analyst’ estimate of $1.23, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. UPS has ample liquidity to manage through the coronavirus crisis and will not tap federal relief under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) act, Chief Financial Officer Brian Newman said on a conference call. Rival FedEx, which is grappling with both internal and external challenges, also is not participating in that program - which helps cover employee pay but allows the government to demand an ownership stake in the company."

The online retailer told customers that the service, Amazon Shipping, will be paused starting in June, according to the Wall Street Journal, which was first to report the change. Amazon is suspending the service because it needs people and capacity to handle a surge in its own customers’ orders, the Journal reported, citing sources. “We regularly look at a variety of factors across Amazon to make sure we’re set up in the right way to best serve our customers,” an Amazon spokesperson told Reuters in an email confirming the halt in service. Amazon Shipping is available in a handful of U.S. cities, including Los Angeles, and handles non-Amazon and Amazon marketplace packages. The company is grappling with a demand surge in the United States, where most residents are under stay-at-home orders to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus that is sweeping around the globe.

24.475679364158104," UPS employee dies of COVID-19 infection in Kentucky LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A United Parcel Service Inc worker employed in Kentucky died over the weekend from a COVID-19 infection, Gov. Andy Beshear said at a public health briefing on Monday. UPS separately said that a “valued member of our management team” at its Worldport global shipping hub in Louisville, Kentucky, had died. UPS declined to give the man’s cause of death, citing medical privacy laws. UPS employs roughly 20,000 workers in the Louisville area - mainly at Worldport, which is central to the U.S. government’s effort to rush in medical supplies for healthcare workers. Worldport employees told Reuters and Louisville television station WDRB, which was first to confirm the Worldport death, that they believed the supervisor who died on Saturday had contracted COVID-19. Employees, who declined to be named for fear of retribution, told Reuters that UPS is not disclosing how many of their co-workers have fallen ill after being exposed to the novel coronavirus that has killed more than 10,000 people in the United States. Other large employers - including GE Appliance, Amazon and Ford Motor Co - have briefed workers on COVID-19 cases in their facilities without revealing the names of affected individuals. Atlanta-based UPS last week said it is working with President Donald Trump’s Coronavirus Taskforce, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and state agencies to distribute test kits, protective equipment like N95 masks, and medical devices such as respirators. FEMA is using UPS’s 5.2 million-square-foot Worldport facility for temporary staging of shipments from overseas as part of a public-private partnership that the Trump Administration has named Project Airbridge.

-10.345231859995431," Amazon holiday quarter delivers, threatens profit squeeze for UPS and FedEx (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc's AMZN.O rapid expansion of one-day shipping delivered a strong holiday quarter and showed the rising ambition of the company, which in six years has created a network that handles nearly as many packages as FedEx Corp FDX.N. Amazon's growth may squeeze profits at United Parcel Service Inc UPS.N and other carriers, but a booming e-commerce industry and Amazon's own needs mean the older companies are not packing it in. The world’s biggest online retailer started making its own deliveries after an unexpected surge in 2013 holiday orders swamped UPS and FedEx. Amazon delivered 3.5 billion - or roughly half - of its global orders in 2019. By comparison, 46-year-old FedEx handled about 3.8 billion deliveries in its latest fiscal year. Amazon also made significant gains against UPS, which was founded in 1907, and had volume of 5.5 billion last year. Research firm eMarketer expects global online sales to hit $6.25 trillion in 2023 - up 560% from 2013. “There’s definitely a room for a third” major shipper, said Cathy Morrow Roberson, founder of Logistics Trends & Insights, who added that the UPS-FedEx duopoly keeps U.S. prices high. The average cost of shipping a U.S. parcel was $9.51 in 2018, versus $1.81 in China and $5.26 in Germany, according to the Pitney Bowes Parcel Shipping Index. The dominant U.S. carriers are getting squeezed as Amazon competition lowers rates and e-commerce pushes up some costs. Online orders cost more to handle than business packages because they are often far-flung, one-off residential deliveries. The physical breadth of the United States also means costs could remain higher than in other countries. Amazon so far is reserving lower-cost urban deliveries for its in-house service, while handing rural packages to carriers. The density of urban environments means costs per package are lower than rural routes. UPS has some leverage because its unified delivery network is more efficient than the split FedEx Express and Ground networks. But, UPS depends on Amazon for 11.6% of its revenue. “As with any customer, there’s no such thing as unattractive freight, just unattractive pricing, so it will be up to UPS to make a decent return on this growing customer,” Stifel analyst David Ross said in a client note. Amazon’s use of inexpensive independent contractors and e-commerce dominance give it the ability to negotiate hard. Memphis, Tennessee-based FedEx broke up with Amazon over the summer, giving up about 1% of its revenue. UPS’s U.S. Next Day Air business scooped up much of that volume - and saw a 9.2% drop in revenue per package for 2019. UPS’s unionized workforce - and its dependence on Amazon business - leaves it particularly exposed to competition from the Seattle company’s rising logistics unit. “That will be a bigger hit to UPS than FedEx,” Roberson said."
-11.48336093201646," UPS e-commerce projects weigh on 2020 profit forecast (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc UPS.N on Thursday said accelerated spending on weekend delivery and speedier service would take a bite out of 2020 expected earnings, sending shares down 6.2% in midday trading. The world's biggest package delivery firm is under pressure to wring more profit from booming e-commerce deliveries as it builds always-on operations to serve Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O and other online retailers. Chief Executive David Abney told Reuters it will not take the company long to show results. “The investments we’re making now are going to be accretive in 2021. There is a short-term return on this,” Abney said. Those comments did not reassure investors. They sold shares after UPS forecast 2020 adjusted earnings of $7.76 to $8.06 per share - at least a penny below analysts’ average estimate of $8.07 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Shares in UPS were down $7.20 to $108.56 in midday trading. Amazon, UPS’ largest customer, is hitting the gas on speed with its one-day delivery push. Chief Financial Officer Brian Newman said Amazon accounted for 11.6% of UPS revenue for the year. The company, which is building a competing logistics network, was the biggest single contributor to UPS growth in the fourth quarter after Amazon moved FedEx Corp FDX.N business to the carrier. UPS is pulling forward projects that cater to online retailers, including plans to double weekend deliveries in the United States. The Atlanta-based company is supporting that effort with extended package pickup hours for retailers who ship online orders from their stores. It is also hiring weekend delivery drivers, Friday night package sorters and overnight semitruck “sleeper teams” that get packages to hubs more quickly. UPS’s profit for the fourth quarter matched Wall Street’s target of $2.11 per share, despite a slight miss on revenue for the period that included the all-important holiday quarter. UPS Next Day Air volume jumped more than 22% in 2019, benefiting from the shift to next-day delivery and the Amazon-FedEx split, Cowen Analyst Helane Becker said in a client note. That business also shows how customer demands for more, faster and cheaper delivery is playing out at UPS. Revenue-per-piece from the company’s U.S. Next Day Air business fell 9.2% year over year, Becker said."
-11.48336093201646," UPS buying 10,000 electric delivery vans, will test Waymo self-driving vehicles next month LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc on Wednesday expanded its efforts to cut emissions and delivery costs with separate deals to order 10,000 electric delivery trucks from UK-based Arrival Ltd and test Waymo self-driving vehicles to carry packages. The UPS/Arrival partnership includes a minority investment from the world’s biggest package delivery firm and lands four months after customer-turned-rival Amazon.com Inc ordered 100,000 electric vans from Rivian, a Michigan startup partially funded by the world’s largest online retailer. UPS said a six-month test run with Waymo, the self-driving unit of Google parent Alphabet Inc, would start next month. UPS will pay Waymo to use autonomous Chrysler Pacifica minivans to shuttle packages from Phoenix UPS stores to a nearby sorting center several times a day, starting with one route. The Arrival and Waymo projects “will help us continue to push the envelope on technology and new delivery models that can complement the way our drivers work,” said Juan Perez, chief information and engineering officer at UPS. Financial terms were not disclosed for either deal. Amazon’s growing delivery network is putting pressure on UPS and rival FedEx Corp, which are racing to squeeze more profits from surging e-commerce deliveries that are upending their business models. Electric vehicles have no tailpipe emissions - which is critical as more cities worldwide crack down on pollution from idling delivery vehicles. Broad corporate adoption of electric vehicles could cut sticker prices and make them cheaper to operate and maintain than fossil fuel-burning vehicles. Eventually, removing human drivers might cut costs further. Perez said the Waymo test would not replace the driver on the affected route. That driver will still make the scheduled daily UPS Store stop. For Waymo, UPS counts as the latest in a series of moves to expand use of its robotic “Waymo Driver” system beyond robo-taxis. Waymo recently expanded testing of its autonomous trucks and vans to Texas and New Mexico. It also has extended a deal with vehicle retail chain AutoNation Inc to deliver parts to Phoenix-area stores. AutoNation in turn services Waymo vehicles. Atlanta-based UPS plans to take ownership of all 10,000 Arrival zero-emission electric vehicles by 2025. The first trucks should hit streets in Paris, London and undisclosed U.S. cities in the second half of this year. Executives from Arrival and UPS said the trucks had a modular “skateboard platform” that allows users to customize vehicles with swappable parts that reduce production and maintenance costs."

-16.152098655868592," UPS doubling down on weekend deliveries as e-commerce booms and Amazon looms (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc UPS.N said it aims to more than double weekend deliveries in 2020 as package carriers look for ways to satisfy the always-on demands of e-commerce customers, including rising rival Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O. The world's biggest online retailer pioneered seven-day delivery in 2013, in partnership with the U.S. Postal Service (USPS), and is now spending billions of dollars to speed up its free shipping. UPS added Sunday to its weekend services at the start of this year, following FedEx Corp FDX.N, which did the same late last year. “E-commerce spikes on the weekends, and retailers want those orders delivered sooner,” UPS Chief Marketing Officer Kevin Warren said in a statement ahead of UPS and Amazon’s quarterly reports on Thursday. UPS said it aimed to expand its year-round Saturday service, which started in 2017, to 40 million more U.S. customers. The company declined to disclose its current weekend volume. The average volume of overall U.S. weekend deliveries doubled to 13.5 million units between 2013 to 2019, consultancy ShipMatrix said. That was fueled by online retail sales, which surged 127% to almost $591 billion in 2019, according to research firm eMarketer. UPS aims to attract more retailers that want to keep pace with Amazon shipping speeds, while holding on to its Amazon business, which accounts for almost 20% of company volume. LensDirect.com Chief Executive Ryan Alovis said UPS’s expanded weekend service means sunglass and contact lens orders that ship on Thursday or Friday hit customer doorsteps on Saturday instead of Monday, helping online retailers compete against Amazon. “It has leveled the playing field,” Alovis told Reuters. Weekend operations are more expensive because they skew toward one-off, far-flung residential deliveries - so UPS is attacking the costs, industry experts said. Amazon, which itself delivered 3.5 billion packages globally last year, has cherry-picked desirable urban deliveries and left the costlier rural business to UPS, USPS and other providers. The top hourly wage for UPS’s unionized weekend drivers is around $32 per hour, about 15% less than weekday drivers’ top rate but still well above the roughly $15 per hour that Amazon delivery drivers make. UPS and FedEx need to add more packages per delivery to boost profits on residential shipments, said Dean Maciuba, a director at Logistics Trends & Insights. “The thing preventing that from happening more quickly is Amazon,” Maciuba said. Recent results from FedEx offered a cautionary tale. The Memphis company in December slashed its 2020 profit forecast, blaming in part higher-than-expected startup costs for its residential service that delivered nearly 8 million packages on Sundays between Black Friday, which last year fell on November 29, and Christmas."

Amazon’s growing delivery network is piling pressure on UPS and rival FedEx Corp, which are racing to squeeze more profits from surging e-commerce deliveries that are upending their business models. Electric vehicles have no tailpipe pollution - which is critical as more cities worldwide crack down on emissions from idling delivery vehicles. Broad corporate adoption of electric vehicles could cut sticker prices and make them cheaper to operate and maintain than fossil fuel-burning vehicles. Eventually, removing human drivers might cut costs further. Perez said the Waymo test will not replace the driver on the affected route. That driver will still make the scheduled daily UPS Store stop. For Waymo, the deal with UPS is the latest in a series of moves to expand use of its robotic “Waymo Driver” system beyond robo-taxis. Waymo recently expanded testing of its autonomous trucks and vans to Texas and New Mexico. Waymo also has extended a deal with vehicle retail chain AutoNation Inc to deliver parts to Phoenix area stores. AutoNation in turn services Waymo vehicles. Atlanta-based UPS plans to take ownership of all 10,000 Arrival zero-emission electric vehicles by 2025. The first trucks should hit streets in Paris, London and undisclosed U.S. cities in the second half of this year. The Arrival trucks have a modular design that promises to be cheaper to build, maintain and customize. Vehicle components are swappable and designed to be changed in 15 minutes or less. For example, left and right headlights are the same and can be installed in any size truck, “almost like putting Legos together,” said Scott Phillippi, senior director of automotive maintenance and engineering at UPS. The trucks also have “advanced driver-assistance systems” including collision avoidance and features that could one day enable UPS, which already deploys self-driving tugs that transport large packages in some facilities, to run more automated vehicles in its depots.

-19.404014060252948," U.S. holiday returns surge with booming e-commerce LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc UPS.N on Thursday expects to ship 1.9 million gifts and other items back to U.S. retailers as e-commerce fuels an anticipated 26% year-over-year volume surge on ""National Returns Day."" Jan. 2 is the busiest day for holiday returns in the United States. U.S. shoppers return more packages than their peers around the globe, spurred by free shipping on orders and returns - costly perks that squeeze retailer profits. About 10% of goods sold in the United States go back to retailers every year, resulting in roughly $369 billion in lost sales, according to a 2018 report from Appriss Retail and National Retail Federation. Apparel is an outsized contributor. Returns in some categories approach 50% due to inconsistent sizing across brands, said Greg Buzek, founder and president of IHL Group, a research and advisory firm. “That causes great expense for retailers,” said Buzek, who estimated that annual global losses from retail returns are nearly $1 trillion – up from $600 billion in 2015. A new crop of startups aims to take the bite out of returns. Los Angeles-based Happy Returns promises to slash returns-related expenses up to 30% by reducing shipping costs and customer support calls. It has 700 “return bars” in U.S. retail stores and shopping malls, where customers drop off items and arrange refunds or exchanges. The company charges retailers a flat fee for every item it processes. “You have to have some free (return) option. Nobody said it had to be the mail,” said Happy Returns Chief Executive David Sobie. Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O also encourages shoppers to return products to its own physical stores or Kohl's KSS.N locations, where eligible items are packed and shipped for free. While 30% of shoppers return items to stores, more than twice that many opt for shipping, according to UPS’ 2019 Pulse of the Online Shopper report. UPS said it handled more than 1 million returns each day in December, but declined to give an annual total. UPS and home furnishing retailer IKEA are among the investors in Optoro Inc, which helps retailers sort, resell and dispose of returned merchandise more efficiently. The aim is to prevent products from sitting in a back room losing value or getting routed and rerouted at great expense, said Larisa Summers, Optoro’s senior vice president of e-commerce. “You have to welcome these goods back, otherwise customers won’t shop with you the first time,” Summers said."
-15.348879490448638," Holiday season package returns to hit a record high, says UPS (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc UPS.N expects returned packages to hit a record high following this year's holiday shipping season, as consumers shopped more online, the package delivery company said on Thursday. UPS said it expects to process 1.9 million returns on Jan. 2, up 26% from a year earlier and a seventh-consecutive annual record. “This process is a change from years past, when consumers would rush to physical retailers the day after Christmas and stand in long lines to make returns,” UPS said in a statement. U.S. shoppers spent more online during this year's holiday shopping season, a report by Mastercard Inc MA.N showed on Wednesday, as e-commerce sales hit a record high. E-commerce sales rose 18.8% year-on-year and comprised 14.6% of total retail sales, according to Mastercard’s data tracking retail sales from Nov. 1 through Christmas Eve."
-19.603002185657573," Amazon to raise U.S. fulfillment fees 3 percent for merchants next year (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc plans to raise the fees it charges merchants for warehousing and shipping their goods in the United States by an average 3% next year, the company said Friday, as it faces higher costs from infrastructure and programs such as one-day delivery. The e-commerce company now handles delivery for the majority of U.S. orders through its in-house logistics arm, and is expected to sink nearly $1.5 billion this holiday season alone into halving fulfillment times to one day for Prime loyalty customers. Delivery that is faster than what retail rivals can offer has been key to Prime, a paid subscription program that incentivizes its 100-plus million members to do more of their shopping on Amazon. In an email Friday to merchants who sell on its marketplace, Amazon said it has invested more than $15 billion this year in tools, infrastructure and programs like Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA) to help sellers. “Driven by FREE One-Day Delivery, this was the largest one-year investment we have ever made in FBA. Nevertheless, in 2020, we will make only moderate increases (about 3%) in fulfillment fees, below industry average, because we remain committed to your continued success,” said the email, seen by Reuters. Other charges for merchants known as referral fees will go down in some instances, the email said. In a statement, an Amazon spokeswoman added that the investments are helping merchants boost sales and that the company still is “the most competitively priced option for entrepreneurs to reach customers with fast shipping.” Carriers routinely raise delivery rates. FedEx Corp and United Parcel Service Inc will increase certain U.S. ground and air fees an average 4.9 percent in the coming weeks, according to their published rates, though customers can negotiate discounts. Amazon’s changes largely take effect Feb. 18."
-18.01305690497807," Amazon to deliver 3.5 billion packages through own network in 2019 (Reuters) - Amazon.com Inc said on Thursday it was on track to deliver 3.5 billion customer packages globally this year through its in-house delivery network. Amazon, with its growing network of delivery planes, trucks and vans, is regarded as a potential long-term threat to FedEx Corp and United Parcel Service Inc UPS.N. FedEx this summer ended its relationship with the world’s biggest online retailer. UPS continues to deliver millions of packages for Amazon, which said it now handles the delivery of about half of its own packages around the world. A Morgan Stanley analysis from last week estimated that Amazon logistics delivered about 20% of the company’s packages last year and nearly 46% in 2019 through August. The brokerage estimated the Amazon delivery network will move 6.5 billion packages by 2022, more than UPS at 5 billion and FedEx at 3.4 billion. Amazon said it now has 150 U.S. delivery stations employing more than 90,000 people."
-19.22791826753075," Four people killed in failed robbery shootout in Florida (Reuters) - Four people died in a shootout following the theft of a United Parcel Service Inc UPS.N truck and an attempted jewelry store robbery in a Miami suburb, the FBI and police said late on Thursday. Police said the two thieves and two by-standers were killed. The incident began with an attempted robbery of a jewelry store in the Miami suburb of Coral Gables, in the city’s famed “Miracle Mile” shopping district about 4:15 p.m. The shop owner confronted the robbers with a gun. At one point, a female employee of the store was slightly wounded by a ricocheted bullet, police said. At least one bullet hit Coral Gables city hall, breaking a window and the building was put on lock-down, police said. After the failed robbery the thieves stole a UPS truck, taking the driver hostage at gunpoint, and led police on a chase which ended in gunfire about 20 miles north of Miami in Miramar, police said. The shootout started after the truck became stuck in traffic on the Interstate 75 highway. The two thieves were shot and killed, FBI agent George Piro told the media. Two civilians were also killed, the UPS truck driver and a bystander, said Coral Gables Police Chief Ed Hudak. It was unclear if the hostage and bystander were shot by the robbers or in police crossfire, Hudak said. UPS said in a statement to Reuters that it was saddened by the incident, which the company described as a “senseless act of violence”. No names of the deceased were immediately released."
-16.39256264206224," UPS liable for shipping contraband cigarettes in New York, damages reduced: court NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal appeals court found United Parcel Service Inc liable to New York state and New York City for shipping hundreds of thousands of cartons of untaxed cigarettes, but reduced its payout for damages and unpaid taxes to about $97.6 million from $247 million. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan agreed with a trial judge that UPS violated a federal anti-cigarette trafficking law and New York’s public health law by shipping the contraband cigarettes, which often came from Indian reservations. In a 115-page decision, Circuit Judge Gerard Lynch wrote that UPS also violated its October 2005 Assurance of Discontinuance with the state not to ship cigarettes to consumers and unlicensed dealers, and that shielding it from liability “would thwart the AOD’s purpose.” But the court also said the trial judge imposed excessive civil penalties, and should not have halved what Atlanta-based UPS owed for unpaid state and local excise taxes. Civil penalties were lowered to $78.8 million from $237.6 million, while the tax payout doubled to $18.8 million from $9.4 million. New York state would receive about $58.8 million overall, and New York City about $38.8 million. The vote was 2-1. The dissenting judge, Circuit Judge Dennis Jacobs, would have set aside more of the payout. New York state and New York City originally sought more than $872 million. UPS said in a statement that it may appeal, but was pleased that the “unwarranted damages” award was reduced significantly. James Johnson, New York City’s corporation counsel, in a statement said the decision was a “big win” for New Yorkers, and “sent a powerful message to companies: Do not illegally transport untaxed cigarettes; it will cost you.” The office of New York Attorney General Letitia James did not immediately respond to requests for comment. State and city officials had accused UPS of having since 2010 shipped more than 683,000 cartons of untaxed “contraband” cigarettes to unlicensed wholesalers, unlicensed retailers and residences, often from smoke shops on Indian reservations. Both sides had appealed from parts of the May 2017 award by U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest, which followed a non-jury trial. Forrest is now in private practice. In January, UPS rival FedEx Corp agreed to pay $35.4 million to settle three lawsuits by New York state and New York City over the shipment of untaxed cigarettes. The case is State of New York et al v United Parcel Service Inc, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, Nos. 17-1993, 17-2107, 17-2111."
-11.97991840498631," UPS drone makes first home prescription deliveries for CVS LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc UPS.N Flight Forward drones have flown prescription medications to the front lawn of a private home and to a retirement center, the UPS unit's first revenue-generating deliveries for drugstore chain CVS Health Corp CVS.N. Flight Forward’s maiden delivery flight on Friday in Cary, North Carolina, beat rivals in one phase of the race for the nascent market. The second drone flight delivered medications to a public space at a retirement community. The packages, roughly the size of small shoeboxes, were lowered from drones hovering at an altitude of about 20 feet. UPS and CVS said on Tuesday the deliveries were the first of their kind under an program approved by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Regulators are still hammering out rules for how the unmanned winged vehicles will operate in U.S. airspace and guidelines are expected in 2021. “We see big potential in drone delivery in rural communities where life-saving medications are needed and consumers at times cannot conveniently access one of our stores,” said Kevin Hourican, president of CVS Pharmacy. “CVS is exploring many types of delivery options for urban, suburban and rural markets,” Hourican added. In September, UPS became the first company to win the broadest FAA certification to operate a drone airline. That permits Flight Forward to collect payment for drone deliveries and to fly as many drones supported by as many operators as necessary to meet customer demand. Flight Forward and drone startup Matternet have inked a variety of deals to deliver biological samples on a handful of medical campuses. Wing, a drone operator owned by Google parent Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O, is partnering with Walgreens WBA.O and FedEx Corp FDX.N for a home delivery pilot in Christiansburg, Virginia."
1.786654017322194," UPS COO's retirement eclipses e-commerce gains (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc's UPS.N e-commerce fueled quarterly profit beat on Tuesday was overshadowed by news that Jim Barber, widely viewed as the world's biggest parcel delivery firm's next leader, would retire at year-end. Shares in Atlanta-based UPS fell 3 percent to $115.03 on news of the departure of Chief Operating Officer Barber, 59, who oversees the company’s global small package, freight, supply chain, freight forwarding and engineering, and was instrumental in the company’s turnaround. “Investors assumed he was going to be the next CEO and this caught us by surprise. Unfortunately, the market does not like surprises,” Seaport Global analyst Kevin Sterling said. Barber’s retirement comes just months after similar news from Chief Financial Officer Richard Peretz, ushering in big changes to the UPS C-suite at a time when cooling economies in Asia and Europe threaten global growth. “We have a strong bench. Succession planning is something we constantly focus on,” Chief Executive David Abney said on a conference call with analysts. UPS said Barber and Peretz will guide UPS through the key holiday peak shopping and shipping season, when the company’s daily volumes can double. Profit was up 16% to $1.75 billion for the third quarter. UPS earned $2.07 per share, excluding items, to top analysts’ average forecast by a penny, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The U.S. consumer continues to spend, bolstering online sales that fueled a 24% rise in UPS Next Day Air U.S. delivery volume during the third quarter. That business ticked up significantly during the summer, after UPS rival FedEx Corp's FDX.N breakup with online retailer Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O. “It’s Amazon, but it’s beyond Amazon,” Abney said in a telephone interview with Reuters. “Companies are competing on time. Next Day has become the standard. We see it in our Next Day Ground and our Next Day Air,” said Abney. The company’s multi-billion-dollar investments in network upgrades shaved per-package costs by 2.5% during the third quarter, helping to offset a 10.1% drop in revenue per piece for domestic Next Day Air. That deterioration in revenue per piece is likely due to the small packages that Amazon is shipping - including single bars of soap or deodorant, said Cathy Morrow Roberson, founder of consulting firm Logistics Trends & Insights. Investors remain wary that the U.S.-China trade war could further dent global economies and UPS, whose international package group accounts for roughly 35% of operating income."

The service, which will debut in one or two U.S. cities in the coming weeks, shows how the parcel delivery company plans to expand its upstart drone business beyond hospital campuses. “Flight Forward will work with new customers in other industries to design additional solutions for a wide array of last-mile and urgent delivery challenges,” UPS Chief Strategy and Transformation Officer Scott Price said. The Atlanta-based company this month won the U.S. government's first approval to operate a drone airline, leapfrogging rivals like Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O and Alphabet Inc's GOOGL.O Wing and clearing the way for the expansion of Flight Forward. UPS, which owns 251 jet aircraft and charters nearly 300 more, is building its Flight Forward business at a time when U.S. drone delivery is in its infancy. Regulations for operating those unmanned vehicles in U.S. airspace are not expected until 2021. On Monday, Flight Forward and partner Matternet also announced a deal to deliver biological samples and other cargo on University of Utah Health hospital campuses. That will be similar to the service at North Carolina’s WakeMed Hospital, where Flight Forward operates about 10 flights per day, said Bala Ganesh, vice president of the advanced technology group at UPS. Flight Forward has also signed a hospital campus deal with healthcare provider Kaiser Permanente, UPS said. In addition, the company said pharmaceutical distributor AmerisourceBergen Corp ABC.N will use Flight Forward drones to move pharmaceuticals, supplies and records to select U.S. medical campuses it serves.

3.4970432869106163," UPS hits the gas on greener delivery truck fleet LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Starting next year, there will be a lot more “green” in those brown UPS delivery trucks. United Parcel Service Inc on Wednesday announced plans to buy more than 6,000 natural gas-powered trucks over three years and step up purchases of renewable natural gas (RNG) as part of a new $450 million investment to reduce the environmental impact of its 123,000-vehicle fleet. The latest move from the world’s largest package delivery firm comes as utility companies, investors and others seek to expand the use of RNG - which is derived from decomposing organic matter such as cow manure on dairy farms, discarded food in landfills and human waste in water treatment plants - to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. RNG and natural gas from fossil fuel are both methane and can be used interchangeably. Natural gas vehicles are less polluting than those that run on unleaded gasoline or diesel, but RNG has the added benefits of replacing fossil fuel and preventing naturally occurring methane - a powerful greenhouse gas - from being released into the environment. UPS’s latest effort “allows for seamless integration of a truly renewable, organic fuel source into the fleet,” Mike Whitlatch, UPS’s vice president of global energy and procurement, told Reuters. UPS expects to use 31.9 million gasoline gallon equivalents (GGE) of RNG this year. As of this month, it has agreed to purchase 230 million GGE of RNG over the next seven years, a commitment that UPS says makes it the transportation industry’s largest user of RNG. “We provide one large-single user to help de-risk (RNG) projects,” Whitlatch said of UPS. The Atlanta-based company’s new vehicle purchases will begin next year and add to the roughly 10,000 alternative fuel or advanced technology delivery vehicles already in use by UPS. Norway-based Hexagon Composites’ Agility Fuel Solutions will equip UPS’s new brown delivery trucks, semi trucks and terminal tractors to run on natural gas. UPS customer and rival Amazon.com Inc last month pledged to buy 100,000 electric delivery vehicles from startup Rivian Automotive LLC and have them all on the road by 2024. Amazon’s independent delivery partners currently use about 30,000 conventional fuel vans. UPS’s fleet of planes and trucks created 14.6 million metric tonnes of CO2e, a standard unit for measuring carbon footprints, while moving 5.2 billion packages in 2018. Amazon, which has not yet released data on its carbon footprint, last month said it would be net carbon neutral by 2040."

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) granted UPS’ Flight Forward drone subsidiary a Part 135 Standard certification on Friday. The company said the certificate allows it to expand its delivery service in campus settings such as hospitals and universities, but added that residential deliveries are years away. The certification allows UPS pilots to fly drones beyond their line of sight and opens the door for the delivery company to expand Flight Forward. The fledgling unit is immediately doubling the number of drone flights it does for its flagship customer, Raleigh, North Carolina’s WakeMed Health & Hospitals. “We’ll easily get to 20-plus flights per day, per drone,” said Scott Price, UPS’ chief strategy and transformation officer. “It’s a business, it’s not a prototype or a test,” Price said of Flight Forward, which is paid to ferry blood and tissue samples to WakeMed’s central laboratory from points around its main hospital campus. UPS said its latest certification clears the way for Flight Forward to add other campus delivery projects without seeking government approvals for each one. “There are hundreds of campuses in the United States,” said Price, who added that UPS is eyeing drone deliveries on hospital, corporate and university campuses as it builds Flight Forward. “This is a big step forward in safely integrating unmanned aircraft systems into our airspace,” U.S. Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao said in a statement. Under the new FAA approval, UPS Flight Forward pilots may now operate multiple drones under one certificate. Earlier this year, Alphabet’s Wing, the sister unit of search engine Google, was the first company to get U.S. air carrier certification for a single-pilot drone operation.

-2.5475592644333878," UPS to pay $8.4 million to resolve U.S. overcharging probe WASHINGTON (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc has agreed to pay the United States $8.4 million to resolve allegations it overcharged federal agencies for package delivery services, the U.S. Justice Department said on Friday. The settlement resolves allegations that from 2007 to 2014, UPS failed to follow a General Services Administration (GSA) contract requiring it to provide agencies with certain agreed discounts, resulting in the government paying more than it should have for package deliveries, the government said. The Justice Department said there has been no determination of liability in the settlement that covers ground delivery service. “Contractors are expected to carefully comply with the pricing requirements of GSA contracts and other federal contracts,” said Assistant Attorney General Jody Hunt of the Justice Department’s Civil Division. “This settlement demonstrates that the government will hold accountable contractors that overcharge federal agencies by failing to follow the pricing terms of federal contracts.” UPS said in a statement that the “allegations stem from good faith differences regarding contract interpretation and were resolved as a contractual matter.” The company added that it “maintains a strong relationship with its government customers and supports the important work of federal agencies under many contractual vehicles, including the one at issue here.”"
-2.1361352800662483," UPS holiday hiring unchanged from last year amid retail job slump LOS ANGELES, Sept 9 (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc plans to hire 100,000 holiday workers, the same number as last year, as a continued shedding of retail jobs hints at a softening in the U.S. consumer economy heading into the all-important Christmas shopping season. The world’s biggest parcel delivery firm is among the first to announce its holiday hiring target, which landed on the heels of a Labor Department report showing continued malaise in retail employment, even as wage growth buoys consumer spending. UPS said it can use the same number of workers as last year because it has invested in technology to automate package sorting and shave miles (km) off delivery routes - but it is paying more to lure those seasonal package sorters, drivers and delivery assistants in a competitive job market. The Atlanta-based company is raising its minimum starting wage for seasonal workers to $14 per hour from $10.10 per hour last year, said Danelle McCusker Rees, UPS president of U.S. human resources. The National Retail Federation (NRF), which will release its holiday forecast on Oct. 3, said the U.S. economy remains healthy and pinned Friday’s weaker-than-expected jobs data on a tight labor market and President Donald Trump’s ongoing trade war with China. “If there was less uncertainty associated with trade and tariffs, we would see more business investment, job growth and consumer spending,” said NRF chief economist Jack Kleinhenz, who added that there were 888,000 unfilled retail jobs in June. Retail employment contracted for a seventh straight month in August to hit the lowest level since January 2016. Department store jobs, which have been hard hit by online competition, sunk to the lowest point since the federal government started tracking the data in 1990. E-commerce is retail’s fastest-growing sector, but it was not immune to the industry pullback. Employment in the “nonstore” category that includes e-tailers like Amazon.com Inc shed 1,700 positions in August, a third straight monthly decline from record highs in the Spring. UPS Chief Executive David Abney in July said he expects the company’s U.S. momentum to continue into the peak shipping season, when volume spikes will put its multi-billion-dollar network revamp to the test. This holiday shopping season is the shortest since 2013, when a surge in e-commerce orders overwhelmed delivery companies like UPS and convinced Amazon to start its own business dropping packages on customer doorsteps. FedEx Corp’s recent breakup with Amazon means UPS could handle even more holiday packages for the online retailer, which is dialing up the pressure by promising significantly more one-day deliveries this year. “It’s more challenging, but we’re stronger and better,” UPS Chief Operating Officer Jim Barber told analysts this summer."

10.407961787337056," UPS buys stake in TuSimple, testing self-driving trucks in Arizona DETROIT (Reuters) - UPS said on Thursday it has bought a minority stake in self-driving company TuSimple, and the world’s largest package delivery company has been testing the startup’s autonomous trucks since May on a busy freight route in Arizona. The investment by UPS Ventures, the venture capital arm of United Parcel Service Inc UPS.N, underscores bets that autonomous vehicle technology can expand more rapidly in commercial vehicles than in robotaxis. It could take years to test and develop self-driving vehicles and for the government to build out a regulatory framework. But UPS sees the investment as a way to apply autonomous driving features like lane departure technology, advanced braking systems or sensor technology in its own fleet in the short term, said Todd Lewis, managing partner at UPS Ventures. “From the regulatory perspective there is a long way to go,” Lewis told Reuters. “But the technology has a ton of implications today.” UPS and TuSimple did not disclose the size of the investment. TuSimple's other investors include Chinese online media company Sina Corp SINA.O and U.S. chipmaker Nvidia Corp NVDA.O. In February TuSimple said it had raised $95 million in a funding round led by Sina, which valued the startup at $1 billion. The company is also working with Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O as the online retail giant builds out its own transportation ecosystem. The TuSimple road tests for UPS’ supply chain business run on a busy stretch of highway covering a little over 100 miles (160 km) between Phoenix and Tucson. The trucks run around the clock, with the self-driving trucks delivering freight within UPS’ system. TuSimple has a professional driver behind the wheel and an engineer in the passenger seat. Silicon Valley firms to traditional carmakers are racing to put fully commercial self-driving vehicles on the road, while efforts by robotaxis companies such as General Motors Co GM.N unit Cruise and Uber Technologies Inc UBER.N have stumbled because it is very difficult and expensive to develop self-driving cars capable of anticipating and responding to humans in urban areas. Experts says self-driving trucks are an easier proposition than robotaxis. Self-driving trucks run consistently on predictable highway routes - in UPS’ case carrying large numbers of revenue-generating packages or goods - around the clock, including in the early hours of the morning when driving conditions are ideal. Robotaxis, however, pick up and drop off passengers at random locations, at random times, mostly during the day, leaving expensive assets largely unused overnight. That random business model also requires more extensive, costly mapping. “The economics for a robotaxi are just not as strong as for a truck,” TuSimple Chief Financial Officer Cheng Lu told Reuters. “And a lot of investors see it that way as well.” The startup also ran a two-week test for the U.S. Postal Service earlier this year transporting mail across three Southwestern states. Chief Product Officer Chuck Price said TuSimple is currently evaluating the results of that test."

0.5149924408012828," UPS profit beats expectations as demand for next day service surges (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc UPS.N said on Wednesday a jump in demand for its Next Day Air service drove better-than-expected profit in the second quarter as large retailers rushed packages to online shoppers. Shares of UPS jumped 8.6% to $114.33 in midday trading as the world’s biggest package delivery company also reiterated its 2019 forecast and said it was taking U.S. air volume from rivals. UPS has been spending billions of dollars to modernize its network. Those investments - which include more automated package sorting facilities and new cargo planes - are helping to contain the cost of delivering small numbers of e-commerce packages to far-flung home addresses. “We’ve got momentum here and we believe we can continue,” said Chief Executive David Abney, who added that the company is at an “important turning point” in its nearly 112-year history. Next Day Air volume surged an unexpected 30% in UPS' key domestic business during the second-quarter, as Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O and other large retailers adopted one-day shipping. Abney said some competitors lost second-day air business to its Next Day Air service. “FedEx would be the only other rival that offers such a service,” said Cathy Morrow Roberson, founder of consulting firm Logistics Trends & Insights. FedEx FDX.N in June declined to renew its U.S. Express air shipping contract with Amazon, which is building a shipping network to rival those of established delivery companies like UPS, FedEx and Deutsche Post DHL Group. DBKGn.DE Several analysts said the Next Day Air volume bump likely came from Amazon. UPS said high-margin healthcare shipments also contributed to second-quarter net income that grew 13.5% to $1.69 billion, or $1.94 per share. Analysts had expected a profit of $1.92 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Revenue grew 3.4% to $18.05 billion. Shippers and retailers are gearing up for the peak holiday shipping season, when package volumes tend to soar. This season will be shorter than last year, due to Thanksgiving falling six days later in November. “We’re set up for a very good peak,” said Abney, who told Reuters the company’s U.S. customers remained confident about the domestic economy. Chief Financial Officer Richard Peretz said “results in the second half of the year will be considerably stronger than the first half,” even as global growth cools, U.S. industrial output softens and as Britain’s exit from the European Union and the ongoing U.S.-China trade war disrupt trade. Nevertheless, Peretz said, “we remain concerned about the growing headwinds from trade uncertainty.”"
0.5149924408012828," CORRECTED-UPDATE 1-UPS profit beats on higher e-commerce deliveries (Corrects analysts’ estimate to $1.92 per share from $12.92 in paragraph 7) July 24 (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc, which is the world’s largest package delivery company, beat second-quarter profit estimates on Wednesday, driven by increased demand in domestic shipment from e-commerce companies. The rapid rise in online shopping has been a boon for package delivery companies and UPS has been spending heavily to cut down the extra cost of delivering to households that on average receive fewer packages at a time than businesses. “Demand for faster delivery is a structural change in our industry,” said UPS CEO David Abney. “Anticipating this change, our additional air capacity and modernized network enabled this growth to have a positive impact on profitability and positions UPS well to serve the growing needs of the market.” The U.S.-based company said its domestic segment generated significant volume growth across products led by a more than 30% surge in its next day delivery program, Next Day Air volume, which got a boost from e-commerce deliveries. Revenue at the segment rose 7.7% to $11.15 billion. Net income for the second quarter ended June 30 was $1.69 billion, or $1.94 per share, compared with $1.49 billion, or $1.71 per share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected a profit of $1.92 cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Revenue rose 3.4% to $18.05 billion.

10.315177915934594," UPS launches drone business, seeks to certify multiple pilots LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc UPS.N, the world's largest package delivery firm, on Tuesday unveiled its drone delivery subsidiary and said it has applied for the Federal Aviation Administration certifications needed to expand the business. The launch of UPS Flight Forward marks the latest move in the battle between UPS, Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O and Alphabet Inc GOOGL.O for the lead in the nascent U.S. drone delivery industry. UPS said Flight Forward could receive FAA certification for multiple drones and pilots as early as this year, potentially becoming the first company to win such approvals. UPS is “laying the foundation” for a sustainable drone delivery business, said Bala Ganesh, vice president of the Advanced Technology Group at UPS. The Atlanta-based company plans to roll its revenue-generating hospital project with drone partner Matternet into Flight Forward. UPS and Matternet run five to 10 daily drone flights that transport human medical specimens for WakeMed Health & Hospitals in Raleigh, North Carolina. The drone flights carry blood and tissue samples from various points around WakeMed’s main hospital campus the short distance to its central laboratory. Ganesh declined to say how much revenue the WakeMed deal generates. UPS plans to expand the scope of its WakeMed delivery business as it recruits other hospital customers. Flight Forward is targeting healthcare companies as part of an ongoing UPS effort to use higher-profit specialty deliveries to offset the margin squeeze from booming residential e-commerce deliveries. Reggie Govan, who was chief counsel at the FAA during the Obama administration, said there are significant hurdles to overcome before an army of drones can drop packages at U.S. homes and businesses. It requires a “more sophisticated and robust technology and regulatory framework than currently exists, including more direct regulation by state and local governments than either the FAA or industry has yet to realize,” Govan said. Nevertheless, Govan said, every new step forward “helps to move us from one-off deliveries of toothbrushes, coffee and pizza.” Alphabet’s Wing got a jump on rivals earlier this year when the sister unit of search engine Google became the first company to get U.S. air carrier certification for a single-pilot operation. Amazon, known for its splashy drone delivery tests, said in June it is building fully electric drones. Amazon has “numerous experimental certifications” to test and evaluate its systems.

23.609522605520336," UPS will not join FedEx lawsuit against U.S. government (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc said on Tuesday it would not join a lawsuit FedEx Corp filed against the U.S. government that argues FedEx should not be held liable if it inadvertently shipped products in violation of an export ban. FedEx’s announcement of its suit on Monday came shortly after the U.S. parcel delivery firm reignited Chinese ire over its business practices. A package containing a Huawei phone sent to the United States was returned last week to its sender in Britain, in what FedEx said was an “operational error.” Chinese telecoms company Huawei Technologies Co in May was added to a blacklist of people and companies the U.S. government said posed a security risk, barring it from buying, without special approval, U.S. technology upon which it was heavily reliant. A number of other Chinese firms have also been banned from buying sensitive U.S. technology. In its lawsuit, FedEx said it should not be expected to enforce the export ban, and could not reasonably be held liable for shipping products that it did not know about. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said in a statement that the regulation stated that carriers must not knowingly ship items in contravention of the rules. “It does not require a common carrier to be a policeman or to know what’s in every package,” he said. UPS said in Tuesday’s statement it would continue to follow government directives across the markets where it operates. Last month, China said it would launch an investigation after two parcels sent via FedEx destined for Huawei addresses in Asia were diverted to the United States. FedEx said the packages were “misrouted in error.” In the latest incident, technology news outlet PCMag said that its writer in Britain had attempted to send a Huawei P30 handset to a colleague in the United States. FedEx returned the phone and told the sender that it could not deliver the package because of a “U.S. government issue” with Huawei and the Chinese government, PCMag reported. FedEx’s lawsuit and Chinese anger over the deliveries come against a backdrop of increasing tension between the world’s two biggest economies. Eric Hirschhorn, a former U.S. undersecretary of Commerce, said the lawsuit suggests “the company is caught in the middle between China and the U.S. They’re being squeezed by two governments that are annoyed at each other and they’re trying to do their business.”"

13.555831933710547," UPS profit hurt by severe weather, issues disappointing outlook for second quarter; shares sink (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc said it saw signs of softening in the U.S. economy and issued a disappointing second-quarter profit forecast, sending shares down 7 percent even as it promised a strong end to the year. First-quarter results at UPS were slammed by severe winter weather in the U.S. Northeast and Midwest, but executives said cost cuts and a multibillion-dollar network revamp to improve efficiency would help the company meet its 2019 profit target with a strong second half. Still, analysts said it would be difficult for the company to hit its reiterated 2019 earnings forecast of $7.45 to $7.75 per share, after first-quarter earnings fell short of Wall Street’s target and UPS forecast flat profit for the second quarter. “It implies a heroic ramp” up from an expected 5 percent year-over-year decline in earnings per share in the first half to a rise of 10 to 18 percent in the second half, Bernstein analyst David Vernon said in a note, using his own estimates. “There is pressure on management to execute at a high level during the peak” year-end holiday shipping season, Cowen analyst Helane Becker said. Logistics companies like UPS are seen a bellwethers for the global economy. Rival FedEx was first to warn about a global trade cool-down affecting its results, due in part to the U.S.-China trade battle and to Britain’s exit from the European Union. But neither company had signaled a deceleration in growth in the United States until Thursday, when UPS Chief Executive said the domestic economy is growing “at a slower pace.” Shares in UPS tumbled 7 percent to $106.40 in afternoon trading, while FedEx fell 4.1 percent to $189.79. Operating profit in UPS’ U.S. domestic business, its biggest, dropped to $666 million in the quarter ended March 31, from $756 million a year earlier, largely due to an $80 million hit from weather-related disruptions. Net income fell more than 17 percent to $1.1 billion, or $1.28 per share, from the year-earlier quarter, including a 7 cent per share hit from severe U.S. weather. Excluding an 11 cent per share charge related to modernizing its network, UPS earned $1.39 per share, missing analysts’ average estimate of $1.41, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Revenue rose 0.3 percent to $17.2 billion, but was below expectations for $17.8 billion. Chief Financial Officer Richard Peretz told Reuters 2019 was a “pivot point” for the company, which is building on its three-year plan to automate package-sorting hubs, make routes more efficient and to upgrade airplanes and other equipment. It spent $7 billion on the project in 2018, when it opened four “super hubs” and built or revamped 18 other sorting facilities. UPS will open two more “super hubs” and 18 other modernized sorting facilities this year. It plans to open them earlier than last year, when the addition of new hubs helped its performance during the holiday peak, and related charges will hit second-quarter results. Peretz said UPS will see labor costs fall due to sorting facility automation and a voluntary buyout program last year. At the same time, it is adding higher-margin business-to-business shipments to balance out booming, but lower profit e-commerce shipments for retailers like Amazon.com and Walmart Inc."

-3.9148495597343516," UPS eyes in-home health services with U.S. vaccine project LOUISVILLE, Ky. - United Parcel Service Inc wants to get beyond U.S. doorsteps with a new push into healthcare. The world’s largest package delivery firm is preparing to test a U.S. service that dispatches nurses to vaccinate adults in their homes, Reuters has learned, as the company and its healthcare clients work to fend off cost pressures and competitive threats from Amazon.com. UPS did not disclose which vaccines it would be using in the project, but drug and vaccine maker Merck & Co told Reuters it is looking at partnering with the company for the initiative. The project, previously unreported, shows how UPS is targeting a larger slice of the $85 billion outsourced healthcare logistics market. Deutsche Post’s DHL Group dominates the market, which is expected to grow to $105 billion by 2021. “Over-the-threshold services is where the world is headed,” Chris Cassidy, who joined UPS last year from GlaxoSmithKline PLC to oversee global healthcare logistics strategy, told Reuters in an interview at UPS’ Worldport facility in Louisville. Here is how the test, slated to launch later this year, will operate: Workers in UPS’ 1.7 million-square-foot healthcare complex at Worldport will package and ship the vaccine to one of the more 4,700 franchised U.S. UPS stores. A home health nurse contracted by UPS’ clinical trial logistics unit known as Marken will collect the insulated package, transport it the “last mile” to the patient’s home and administer the vaccine, which will target a viral illness in adults. The aim of the test is to “see if we can connect all these dots,” said Wes Wheeler, chief executive at Marken, which was purchased by UPS in 2016 and is overseeing the vaccine project. It comes as the parcel delivery industry braces for the impact of a cooling economy and competition from customer-turned-rival Amazon, which is building its own logistics network to contain the swelling cost of dropping millions of packages at shoppers’ homes. UPS healthcare customers, facing political scrutiny over high drug prices and systemic waste, are also under pressure from Amazon. The world’s biggest online retailer is teaming up with Berkshire Hathaway and JPMorgan Chase & Co to lower prescription drug costs for their employees. And, it rocked the sector last year with its roughly $1 billion purchase of specialty online pharmacy PillPack. Experts say raising low U.S. adult vaccination rates would reduce healthcare spending by curbing preventable illnesses that result in doctor visits and hospitalizations. Merck, a major UPS healthcare customer, has a portfolio of vaccines for viral illnesses ranging from shingles and hepatitis B to the flu. Spokeswoman Pamela Eisele said the company is considering the project as it looks for new ways to increase access to its medicines and vaccines and boost adult vaccine rates. Experts said the UPS project could also save money by having contract home nurses, rather than higher paid doctors, administer the vaccine. But the test, a first for a large U.S. shipper, is not a guaranteed slam dunk for UPS: Marken’s CEO said it must figure out how to get medical insurers to pay for the new service. UPS, DHL and specialty shippers have a smattering of home health projects around the world - mostly in countries with single-payer health systems. DHL, the healthcare logistics leader with annual medical-related revenue of more than 3 billion euros ($3.4 billion), transports U.K. patients from home to non-emergency hospital appointments. Polar Speed, a U.K. specialty logistics company UPS bought in 2014, has trained and background-checked drivers who enter homes to drop off prescriptions, deliver and install medical refrigerators and infusion pumps, and remove waste such as used syringes and wound dressings. Pharmaceutical companies already pay Marken to give vaccines to patients testing their experimental drugs. Cathy Morrow Roberson, who founded consulting firm Logistics Trends & Insights after working for more than a decade as an analyst at Atlanta-based UPS, said the vaccine project taps the assets and expertise the company has acquired since getting into healthcare in the early 2000s. “They’re reaping the benefits of all the acquisitions and investments they’ve made,” she said. The effort is designed to put even more distance between UPS and Amazon, which lacks the specialized warehouse, temperature-controlled shipping and regulatory infrastructure that healthcare companies require. Amazon currently uses UPS and FedEx Corp for PillPack home deliveries. Major insurers contacted by Reuters declined to say what they pay to have vaccines administered. But an analysis of 2010 MarketScan health claims data sheds some light on the subject - finding that the average cost of a shingles shot was $208.72 at a doctor’s office and $168.50 at a pharmacy. Flu shots cost less than $30 at both locations. The provider of that data declined to update it. Delivering home vaccines at a competitive price may not be the only hurdle to the UPS project’s success, said Stephen Buck, chief executive of Courage Health and a former vice president at McKesson Corp. “Pharmacies and physicians may not be happy about a new player competing against them,” Buck said."

1.6623169167738479," UPS revamp bolsters profit in holiday quarter, shares jump (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc’s multi-billion-dollar effort to revamp its network helped it exceed profit expectations in the crucial holiday fourth quarter, driving down costs as e-commerce deliveries surged to record levels. Shares jumped 5.2 percent to $106.47 in midday trading after UPS also said its efforts would propel growth in adjusted operating profit by around 13 percent this year. “Our strategies are paying off and giving us profit improvement,” UPS Chief Executive David Abney told Reuters. UPS and rival FedEx have undertaken massive network revamps to better manage a surge in packages driven by an increasing shift by consumers to online shopping. Those home deliveries are pricier because there are fewer of them in general than those heading to business addresses. UPS spent $6.6 billion in 2018 as part of a three-year plan to automate package-sorting hubs, make routes more efficient and to upgrade airplanes and other equipment. The effort is beginning to pay off, said Cowen & Co analyst Helane Becker. “UPS posted its strongest peak shipping season since at least 2013 ... and these trends should continue as new global sorting hubs come online,” she said. The earnings report lands as growth in European and Asian economies decelerates and the U.S. shows signs of cooling. UPS rival FedEx Corp last month slashed its 2019 forecast, citing slowing global trade. UPS gets 20 percent of its revenue overseas. It is less exposed than FedEx, which gets one-third of its revenue from outside the United States. UPS is also pushing to recruit more small business customers and to increase expedited services, which are more profitable than delivering e-commerce parcels to shopper doorsteps. Those factors helped “buffer the impacts of global economic softening,” Abney said. To be sure, some impact of the global slowdown on future earnings is expected, with UPS forecasting 2019 earnings per share between $7.45 and $7.75, largely below analysts’ average estimate of $7.69 per share, according to Refinitiv data. That outlook “likely factors in the ... continued uncertainty regarding U.S.-China trade relations and Brexit,” Becker said. Atlanta-based UPS affirmed planned capital spending of 8.5 percent to 10 percent of 2019 revenue, in line with 2018. Net income fell to $453 million, or 52 cents per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, from $1.10 billion, or $1.26 per share, a year earlier, when it booked a gain from changes to U.S. tax law. UPS booked a $1.2 billion after-tax pension charge, double that from a year earlier, as the U.S. stock market swooned in the fourth quarter. On an adjusted basis, it earned $1.94 per share, beating analysts’ estimates by 4 cents. Revenue rose to $19.85 billion from $18.98 billion. U.S. revenue was up almost 6 percent at $12.6 billion, helped by a nearly 5 percent increase in revenue per parcel. International revenue increased 2.9 percent to $3.8 billion. “It looks like UPS is starting to turn the corner on operating performance in domestic,” Bernstein analyst David Vernon said in a note. He said strong international results indicated the company was reaping the rewards of recent investments in larger aircraft."

18.50690365810325," EU court paves way for $2 billion UPS claim as annuls TNT bid veto BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Europe's top court opened the way to a $2 billion damages claim by U.S. delivery company UPS UPS.N on Wednesday by annulling a 2013 decision to stop it buying Dutch firm TNT Express. The European Court of Justice said the ruling followed a procedural error by the European Commission in its veto, which paved the way for FedEx Corp FDX.N to acquire TNT Express for 4.4 billion euros in 2016, a deal it approved. UPS, which has said it is seeking 1.74 billion euros ($1.98 billion) from the European Commission, said it was pleased the court agreed that the company had been given a fair hearing. “The judgment in UPS’s favor makes a number of points preserving a competitive environment in Europe by clarifying the procedure and relevant criteria for merger approval,” it said. The Commission had rejected UPS’s planned 5.2 billion euro acquisition of TNT, saying it had not offered enough concessions to allay concerns that the deal would hurt consumers. The court said the Commission had infringed UPS’s rights of defense by using a different econometric model in its analysis than that used in its exchange of views and arguments with UPS. Wednesday’s ruling follows that of the General Court of the European Union, the EU’s second highest court, in 2017. The Commission had appealed against that ruling."

15.631660683936504," Suspect shot by police dies after standoff at New Jersey UPS facility (Reuters) - A 39-year-old gunman opened fire at a United Parcel Service Inc facility in New Jersey and held two employees hostage for hours on Monday before police fatally shot him, officials said. William Owens barricaded himself and two women inside the sorting facility in Logan Township and police sent a heavily armed SWAT team to the location, about 25 miles (40 km) southwest of downtown Philadelphia, the New Jersey Attorney General’s Office said in a statement. The standoff ended when Owens was shot while exiting the building with the hostages, the statement said. Owens, who was from the nearby town of Sicklerville, was taken to a hospital where he was pronounced dead. Neither of the two women the gunman took hostage was seriously injured, authorities said, and there were no reports of other casualties. The gunman apparently had known at least one of the women, Gloucester County Prosecutor Charles Fiore told reporters. UPS praised the police for their handling of the situation and said all of its employees were safe. “The incident is concluded and all of the employees are accounted for and being attended to by local officials,” the company said in a statement. The New Jersey Attorney General’s Office said it would investigate the police shooting of Owens."
15.631660683936504," FedEx pays $35.4 million to end NY lawsuit over illegal cigarettes NEW YORK (Reuters) - FedEx Corp will pay $35.4 million to settle three lawsuits in which New York state and New York City accused the company of shipping millions of untaxed cigarettes to residents over a decade. The settlement announced on Monday came after a judge ruled last Oct. 15 that FedEx had knowingly violated a federal anti-cigarette trafficking statute, and a 2006 agreement with the state not to ship cigarettes to people’s homes. New York officials said FedEx’s conduct undercut their efforts to protect public health by curbing smoking, and cheated the state and city out of tax revenue from cigarette sales. They said FedEx knowingly shipped cigarettes on behalf of such companies as Kentucky-based Cigarettes Direct To You and Long Island-based Shinnecock Smoke Shop. “Not only did FedEx violate laws created to protect the public from the serious health risks associated with cigarettes, but they also swindled New York City and State out of millions of dollars in tax revenue,” state Attorney General Letitia James said in a statement. Zachary Carter, New York City’s corporation counsel, accused FedEx of shipping cigarettes “for the worst of reasons --profit.” The settlement agreement requires Memphis, Tennessee-based FedEx to stop domestic shipments of cigarettes with “limited” exceptions, punish workers who knowingly arrange such shipments, and hire an independent consultant to monitor its compliance. FedEx did not admit or deny wrongdoing in entering the two-year agreement, which can be extended upon a material breach. The company had no immediate additional comment. In the Oct. 15 ruling, U.S. District Judge Edgardo Ramos in Manhattan said it was “beyond doubt that certain FedEx employees knew that FedEx was shipping unstamped cigarettes,” and held the company responsible for that knowledge. The settlement came after U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest in Manhattan ordered United Parcel Service Inc in May 2017 to pay the state and city $247 million in damages and penalties in a similar case. A federal appeals court will in March consider UPS’ appeal of that award, which the company said resulted from a “cavalcade of errors” by Forrest, who is now in private practice. Cigarette prices in New York are among the highest in the United States. New York City last year set a minimum price of $13 per pack, and this month banned cigarette sales at pharmacies."

4.382790237464686," New UPS navigation tool aims to save time and money with each turn LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc on Tuesday said it is rolling out a new navigation tool designed to reduce costs for the company and headaches for its roughly 60,000 U.S. package delivery drivers. The world’s biggest package delivery firm - known for eliminating most left turns on routes as part of a years-long effort to cut driver miles, fuel use and accident risks - expects to have the new UPSNav technology in most of its U.S. drivers’ hands by 2020. The move comes as UPS and rivals ranging from FedEx Corp and the U.S. Post Office to Amazon.com Inc’s logistics unit grapple with surging e-commerce deliveries and the high cost of taking goods the “last mile” to shopper doorsteps. UPSNav updates the company’s On-Road Integrated Optimization and Navigation (ORION) system that prepares parcel delivery routes. It combines UPS delivery data, including time-saving information such as the location of loading docks and package receiving areas, with ORION maps that cover more than 250 million locations to find the most cost-effective route between stops, company officials said. Saving time for drivers, who make an average of 125 stops per day, can translate into big savings for the company, said Jack Levis, senior director of process management at UPS. “Seconds can add up to minutes and minutes add up to millions,” said Levis. While he declined to forecast how much UPSNav could shave expenses, Levis said saving U.S. package delivery drivers one minute per day could cut annual labor costs by $14.5 million. He said reductions in fuel use and vehicle wear and tear would produce additional savings for UPS’s domestic package unit that had 2017 operating profit of $4.28 billion last year. A UPSNav update due next year will recalculate routes throughout the day, accounting for traffic, remaining deliveries and pick-up requests, said Levis, who added that Canada is also testing the technology. Early data from 5,000 drivers who tested UPSNav showed the biggest cost savings on lower-density suburban and rural routes, which are more costly because they involve more driving miles and fewer revenue-producing delivery stops. It helped all drivers work more efficiently, leaving more time to provide better service, Levis said. “UPSNav takes a lot of the stress out of our work,” said Jason Dayhoff, a UPS driver in Hunt Valley, Maryland. “With this tool, I spend a lot less time hunting for addresses or loading docks.”"
0.925889482539146," UPS to halt pickups for heavy items before vote on contract offer LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc UPS.N has warned customers it will stop picking up shipments of heavy items next Wednesday to avoid potential freight disruptions before union voting on a tentative contract ends on Nov. 11, the company said on Thursday. “Because we do not have a guarantee against a work stoppage, we cannot afford to put our customers’ volume at risk of being stranded in our system,” UPS said in a statement. The halt in pickups for large shipments of goods bound for stores and other destinations will not affect small-package deliveries during the upcoming holiday season, said UPS, which is grappling with union issues as it works to lower delivery costs associated the surge in online orders from Amazon.com AMZN.O and others. UPS wrapped up contract discussions with the Teamsters National Freight Industry Negotiating Committee on Oct. 25. The union has already authorized a strike if members vote “no” on what UPS has said is its final freight division contract offer. On Oct. 5, UPS freight workers rejected an earlier contract offer. An extension agreement is set to expire on Nov. 12. A strike by the 12,000 Teamsters covered by the freight contract would be the first at UPS in more than two decades. Freight accounts for a small portion of the business at UPS, limiting the impact of a strike. The Atlanta-based company had third-quarter freight revenue of $867 million, compared with U.S. Ground revenue of almost $7.5 billion, according to a regulatory filing. “The freight division is a low margin business for UPS, so even the shareholders will not be concerned much,” said Satish Jindel, president of ShipMatrix, a shipping consultancy. He added that the U.S. trucking shortage would enable UPS to quickly regain most of the business after a strike. The freight contract skirmish lands just weeks after the Teamsters ratified a five-year agreement for parcel delivery workers. Fifty-four percent of members voted against that deal, but turnout was so low that union rules required a two-thirds “no” vote to reject it. “We would not expect the parcel division to formally join any labor action,” Bernstein analyst David Vernon said in a client note. Vernon added, however, that “some drivers in pockets of the country unhappy with the parcel contract ... (could) take it out on the company through informal acts of sympathetic protest.” The International Brotherhood of Teamsters represents 250,000 UPS employees."

-5.706128431190425," Mexican couriers seek changes to trade deal to access U.S. market MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Courier companies in Mexico seeking better access to the lucrative U.S. market are pressuring lawmakers to try to improve the terms of a trade deal struck on Sept. 30 with the United States and Canada, industry officials said. U.S. firms, such as FedEx Corp FDX.N and United Parcel Service Inc UPS.N, are allowed to operate in Mexico alongside domestic companies, but Mexican couriers, like market leader Estafeta, are barred from using their own vehicles for shipments between U.S. cities. The new U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), due to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement, would keep those rules intact, in line with U.S. President Donald Trump’s vows to protect U.S. jobs. “We’ve always asked for a level playing field,” said Manuel Armendariz, president of Mexico’s packaging and courier association, which represents about 30 firms. The industry was lobbying Mexican lawmakers to press for changes, Armendariz said. Vanessa Rubio, a Mexican senator, said Mexico could address the issue through national legislation. She also noted that USMCA led to the creation of a transport committee with members from all three countries, which could consider complaints. The U.S. Trade Representative’s Office declined to comment. Mexican freight forwarders are concerned about a clause the United States included in the new pact, which the three countries’ leaders aim to sign by the end of November. That clause could allow the United States to revoke authorization of Mexican freight-forwarders operating long-haul cross-border trips, such as from Tijuana to New York, if U.S. firms can show they are losing market share to Mexican rivals. Mexican firms are upset they do not have the same right. “If they can cancel without prior notice ... we also want this right,” said Enrique Gonzalez, president of Mexico’s National Chamber of Freight Transport (CANACAR). CANACAR is seeking a side letter to the trade deal that would resolve the conflict, said its vice president, Jose Refugio Munoz. Mexican carriers authorized to make international trips are a small percentage of the U.S. freight market. The U.S. Department of Transportation said it authorized 41 Mexican companies to provide long-distance services, comprising 493 drivers. In the United States, there are about 3.5 million freight drivers, it said. “We’re very far from being (a threat),” Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said in an appearance in front of lawmakers this week. The Mexican Economy Ministry did not respond to a separate request for comment on the matter."
-5.706128431190425," UPS gears up for heavy-duty eBike delivery test in Seattle (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc on Thursday will unveil an urban delivery test in Seattle that uses electric bicycles geared to carry packages in large preloaded boxes to save time and cut pollution, the company said. The new project from UPS, which started in Seattle in 1907 as a bicycle messenger company, comes as deliveries of online purchases surge. UPS and its rivals - including FedEx Corp - are also searching for ways to slash delivery costs and vehicle emissions. UPS partnered with Silver Eagle Manufacturing and Truck Trikes to design the cargo eBike, which has a battery-powered electric motor, for the test, which begins on Nov. 5, UPS said. The bike hauls replaceable, 95 cubic-foot boxes that carry packages weighing up to 400 lbs, UPS said, adding that the trailer and replaceable container configuration of the bike is a U.S. first. The rider will pick up pre-loaded containers from a designated city parking spot and return them empty. Using pre-loaded cargo boxes “wipes out” the double handling of packages and helps to shrink delivery costs, Scott Phillippi, UPS senior director for automotive maintenance and engineering for international operations, told Reuters. UPS, the world’s biggest package delivery company, already has walking and bicycle delivery projects in more than 30 cities, including Dublin, Rome, London and Pittsburgh. The company is also testing 9,300 low-emission vehicles around the world. UPS, FedEx and Deutsche Post AG unit DHL face pressure from regulators around the world to lessen the environmental impact of their fleets."
-6.857906387565856," UPS profit gain overshadowed by trade war worries, shares fall (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc UPS.N reported a 20 percent rise in quarterly profit on Wednesday, but shares dropped 3.5 percent after it said the U.S. trade war with China contributed to disappointing international results. Investors consider UPS a bellwether for the U.S. economy and they seized on news that President Donald Trump’s shift to more protectionist trade policies weighed on its results. UPS shares were down $4.04 at $110.20 in late morning trade after the company attributed an 11.6 percent decline in international package operating profit to unhedged currency in emerging markets, higher fuel costs and slowing economic activity resulting from changing trade policies. “Concerns over unresolved trade issues between China and the U.S. as well as Brexit continued to be a focus for our customers,” Chief Executive David Abney said on a call with analysts. “We are assisting them with contingency planning.” Brexit refers to Britain’s exit from the European Union. “We expect international operating profits to rebound in Q4,” Abney said in an interview with Reuters. The rapid rise in online shopping has significantly boosted domestic package volume at UPS, but the company is scrambling to cut the high cost of delivering parcels to households versus businesses, which generally receive parcels in bulk. Operating profit was down 6.1 percent for the U.S. package segment during the latest quarter. UPS is spending billions of dollars to upgrade and expand its network to address competition from FedEx Corp FDX.N and Amazon.com AMZN.O, and is in the early stages of its largest capital spending campaign since the 1980s. The upcoming winter holidays will put those investments to the test. UPS expects to deliver nearly 800 million packages during that peak season, which stretches from Thanksgiving through early January. The world’s largest delivery company said revenue at its U.S. package services rose 8.1 percent in the third quarter, while revenue at its international package segment increased 3 percent. Net income rose to $1.51 billion, or $1.73 per share, in the third quarter, as tax expense fell to $381 million. Total revenue rose 8 percent to $17.44 billion, narrowly missing the $17.46 billion estimated by analysts. The company stuck by its forecast for full-year adjusted earnings of $7.03 to $7.37 per share."

Package delivery companies and retailers have increased their seasonal hiring this year, to cater to the e-commerce sector that is expecting heavy shipping volumes, as shoppers spend more buoyed by a strong economy and labor market. Last week retailer Target Corp unveiled plans to hire about 120,000 seasonal workers for the holidays, up 20 percent from last year, while department store chain Macy’s Inc said it would hire 23,500 temporary workers at its online fulfillment centers across the U.S., an increase of about 30 percent. Retailers’ holiday hiring plans often reflect their sales expectations for the most competitive shopping season of the year, which begins a day after Thanksgiving and continues into early January when there is a large wave of returns. UPS’ smaller rival FedEx Corp is also hiring about 55,000 workers for the season, up about 10 percent compared with a year earlier. UPS, which hired about 95,000 temporary workers last year, had about 454,000 permanent employees as of Dec. 31, 2017, while FedEx employed about 166,000 people as of May 31."

-15.106746967326535," UPS plan to boost business shipping falls short with investors (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc UPS.N is doubling down on shipments between businesses as part of a $20 billion overhaul aimed at automating its facilities and offsetting the profit squeeze from lower-profit home deliveries from large retailers like Amazon.com AMZN.O. The world's biggest package delivery firm's embrace of expensive ""last-mile"" home shipments of everything from clothes to car tires has squeezed margins as it competes with rival shipper FedEx Corp FDX.N, which accepts less of that business. UPS shares fell 2.9 percent to $119.69 on Thursday, after executives boosted long-term earnings targets while maintaining cost-reduction goals and stopping short of saying they would take fewer home deliveries. UPS is still more profitable than FedEx, Morningstar analyst Keith Schoonmaker said, but added “FedEx may be better at saying ‘no’ to low-profit volume.” Atlanta-based UPS, now in the early stages of its largest capital spending campaign since the 1980s, aims to rebalance its mix of customers and package volume to include more small business, healthcare and international shipments, Chief Executive Officer David Abney said at an investor conference in New York. UPS has raised prices for certain residential deliveries to insulate profits, and plans to woo more “high value” home shipments of items like insulin, executives said. “We are going to be more selective,” Abney told Reuters. UPS earmarked most of the spending from its three-year capital investment project to automate package processing. That should help it better manage surging e-commerce package volumes and bring the company in line with FedEx, which is wrapping up a roughly $10 billion investment in its mostly automated network. UPS on Thursday said its restructuring plan will add $1.00 to $1.20 to its adjusted earnings per share by 2022. That includes up to $1 billion in savings from more efficient sorting facilities and purchasing along with a voluntary retirement program. Some investors, however, want the project to slash more costs. Margins in UPS’ domestic unit that contributes more than half of company profits fell to 12.1 percent in 2017 from 13.8 percent in 2012 as residential deliveries displaced more profitable business deliveries, which now account for about half of total volume. UPS, which is already the largest shipper of business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce packages, is adding and enhancing services for that market, which is valued at nearly $1 trillion in the United States. That is roughly twice the size of the faster-growing, business-to-consumer (B2C) segment dominated by UPS client and budding rival shipper Amazon, which uses its muscle to negotiate lower shipping rates than smaller businesses. UPS on Thursday said it will support business customers with new products, including an app that helps users like hospitals track deliveries and route them to the right location within their sprawling facilities - reducing lost packages, costs and headaches. That will augment initiatives such as Ware2Go, a recently launched platform designed to spur more UPS B2B e-commerce deliveries by making it easier and cheaper for small- and medium-sized businesses to shift operations online. “This current effort is not a repeat of past programs,” Chief Marketing Officer Kevin Warren said."

-10.371455225921473," FedEx to not charge extra for most peak-season home deliveries (Reuters) - FedEx Corp FDX.N said on Friday it would not charge customers extra fees for most packages delivered to homes during the peak holiday shopping season, except packages that are oversized, unauthorized or require additional handling. However, rival United Parcel Service Inc UPS.N said last year it would raise surcharges for most residential packages for the 2018 peak season. FedEx would charge $3.20 at its U.S. express business and U.S. and international ground services for a package that needs additional handling, while the surcharge on an oversized package would be $27.50. A $150 surcharge will apply to an unauthorized package at the package delivery company’s U.S. and international ground business. The surcharges are from Nov. 19 to Dec. 24. In June, UPS started charging an extra $150 to handle oversized packages and pallets, along with a new charge for packages with mislabeled dimensions.

UPS will test the class-6 delivery truck for the first six months, including its battery capacity and technical integration, after which UPS may buy more of these trucks. This will be a part of UPS’s plan of about 9,300 low-emission vehicles, including all-electric, hybrid electric and CNG, to understand which technology works best for some routes. UPS has partnered with Workhorse Group Inc WKHS.O to build an all-new electric delivery van and it also has pre-ordered 125 electric semi-trucks from Tesla Inc TSLA.O. Vehicle manufacturers such as Daimler AG DAIGn.DE and Navistar International Corp NAV.N, and a slew of new entrants, are racing to overcome the challenges of substituting batteries for diesel engines in delivery vehicles as regulators crack down on carbon dioxide and soot pollution."
-9.62040138241021," UPS profit tops estimate as online demand rises (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc's UPS.N second-quarter profit topped Wall Street's estimate on Wednesday, after online shipments for customers such as Amazon.com AMZN.O and Walmart Inc WMT.N boosted package volumes in its core U.S. business. Shares rose 4 percent to $116.95 in late morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange after the world’s biggest package delivery company also reaffirmed its full-year profit and capital spending forecasts. Revenue at the company’s U.S. package services rose 6.3 percent versus a year ago, driven by e-commerce demand and price increases that analysts said grew at the highest rate in almost seven years. The rapid rise in online shopping has been a boon for so-called “last-mile” shipping in the United States, and UPS is fighting to protect its industry-leading margins from the higher costs of delivering e-commerce parcels to individual households. UPS Chief Executive David Abney is pumping billions of dollars into network upgrades and expansions to handle the growth from e-commerce, and he is under pressure from some analysts and investors who want faster returns on those investments. “The domestic segment showed less progress turning the corner on profitability than we had bullishly expected,” Bernstein analyst David Vernon said in a client note. In a telephone interview, Abney said UPS “made a lot of progress during the quarter. We also acknowledge that there is continued work to be done.” UPS net income was up 7.3 percent to $1.49 billion, or $1.71 per share, for the second quarter. On an adjusted basis, the company earned $1.94 per share, beating analysts’ estimate by a penny per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. U.S. domestic packaging operating profit fell to 9.1 percent during the quarter, from 12.9 percent a year ago, as planned increases in pension expenses and costs for ongoing network projects weighed on results. Total revenue rose a better-than-expected 9.6 percent to $17.46 billion, as pricing and demand remained strong. International package segment revenue jumped 13.6 percent, while supply chain and freight revenue increased 16 percent. UPS maintained its forecast for full-year adjusted earnings of $7.03 to $7.37 per share and said it still plans to spend between $6.5 billion to $7 billion on network improvements in 2018. On Tuesday, UPS said it expects annual savings of around $200 million from employee buyouts. Because those departures will be staggered over the coming year, the full impact of the savings won’t come until the second quarter of 2019."
-9.62040138241021," Court adviser suggests ruling against EU veto of UPS, TNT merger BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Europe's top court should rule against the EU's veto of United Parcel Service's UPS.N takeover bid for Dutch peer TNT because of procedural errors by regulators, a court adviser said on Wednesday. Such a judgment from the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ) could boost UPS, the world’s largest package delivery company, in its lawsuit against the European Commission for 1.7 billion euros ($2 billion) in damages. The Commission in its 2013 decision said UPS had not offered sufficient concessions to address its concerns that the 5.2-billion-euro ($6.1 billion) deal would lead to higher prices. UPS subsequently challenged the EU rejection of its bid for TNT, which was later acquired by Fedex FDX.N. The General Court, Europe’s second-highest, said the EU competition enforcer had wrongly blocked the deal and it annulled the decision on a procedural irregularity. The Commission then appealed to the Court of Justice of the European Union (ECJ). ECJ Advocate General Juliane Kokott suggested the top court should follow suit. “The Court of Justice should confirm that the Commission’s decision prohibiting the acquisition of TNT Express by UPS should be annulled due to a procedural error,” Kokott said in a non-binding opinion. The ECJ follows such opinions in the majority of cases. “As the General Court correctly held, the Commission infringed UPS’s rights of defense by making material changes to the econometric model on which it relied during the administrative procedure without informing UPS or giving the undertaking an opportunity to submit observations,” Kokott said. UPS welcomed the opinion. “If the full court follows the advocate general, then this will confirm that the European Commission was wrong to block our bid for TNT,” the company said in an email. The case is C-265/17 P, European Commission versus United Parcel Services."

7.052690242003884," UPS tests 'smart lock' technology in New York apartment buildings LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc UPS.N on Tuesday said it is testing ""smart lock"" technology that allows its delivery drivers to open doors and drop multiple packages at secure locations inside apartment buildings around New York City.The test includes ""hundreds of non-doorman"" multi-family buildings in Manhattan and Brooklyn that have installed Latch's ""smart access system."" The project comes as UPS is working to make ""last-mile"" e-commerce deliveries to households more convenient and cost effective by reducing package theft and the need for drivers to make repeated delivery attempts. “It’s difficult to securely deliver packages in high-density, multi-family urban residences, especially when people are not at home,” said Jerome Roberts, vice president of global product innovation at UPS. The partnership with Latch - a New York City-based startup that has raised $26 million in private funding - enables UPS drivers to open entry doors with a handheld device that has a different access credential for each building on a route. Every time a driver enters a building, Latch creates a traceable record. Derek Banta, UPS’s director of global product innovation concepts, said the parcel delivery company will assess the potential cost savings from “completing more deliveries on the first attempt.” UPS, the world's largest package delivery company, and rival FedEx Corp FDX.N have invested billions of dollars to upgrade their networks to handle surging demand for e-commerce deliveries. Residential deliveries typically cost more than business deliveries because drivers usually drop more packages per stop at offices than at homes. FedEx told Reuters it began testing smart lock technology in select markets before the winter holiday shipping season last year. FedEx declined to identify the test markets or its smart access technology partner. Latch a year ago teamed up with Walmart Inc's WMT.N Jet.com e-commerce site to test its technology at 1,000 residential buildings in Manhattan and Brooklyn. Walmart also made waves in September when it started dropping packages inside homes - or groceries inside refrigerators - as part of a test with August Home smart lock customers in Silicon Valley. Amazon.com AMZN.O late last year announced a secure-lock service called Amazon Key that enables Amazon Logistics delivery workers to briefly unlock a customer's door to drop a package inside."
3.7669709135328273," UPS to spend $130 million on new natural gas vehicles, fueling stations LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Package delivery company UPS UPS.N on Tuesday said it will invest $130 million to buy 730 compressed natural gas vehicles and build five more domestic CNG fueling stations as the industry moves to shift from petroleum-burning vehicles to those that use less-polluting alternative fuels. United Parcel Service Inc, along with rivals such as FedEx Corp FDX.N and Deutsche Post AG DPWGn.DE unit DHL, faces pressure from regulators in major cities around the world to lessen the environmental impact of its fleet. UPS has set a goal to have a quarter of the new vehicles it buys running on alternative fuels by 2020. UPS also aims to replace 40 percent of its ground transportation fuel with sources other than conventional gasoline and diesel. “We strongly believe further investment in our natural gas fleet is a key element to help us achieve our long-term goals for reducing our CO2 emissions,” said Carlton Rose, president of global fleet maintenance and engineering for UPS. This latest move will bring its investment in alternative fuel vehicles and related projects to more than $1 billion over the last decade, Atlanta-based UPS said. UPS said Daimler AG's DAIGn.DE Freightliner and Paccar Inc's PCAR.O Kenworth will supply a total of 400 semi-tractors that pull trailers of goods, and that Terminal Investment Corp, or TICO, will supply it with 330 terminal trucks that move trailers at UPS sorting facilities. Deliveries of the new vehicles will start this summer and be completed by the end of November, Mike Casteel, director of fleet procurement for UPS, said. They will become part of UPS’ “rolling laboratory” of roughly 9,100 low-emission vehicles, including all-electric, hybrid electric, ethanol and CNG vehicles, to learn which technology works best for particular routes, the company said. UPS separately has partnered with Workhorse Group Inc WKHS.O to build an all-new electric delivery van with a driving range of 100 miles (160 km), the first of which may be delivered this year, Casteel said. It also has pre-ordered 125 electric semi-trucks from Tesla Inc TSLA.O. Its new CNG fueling stations will be in Goodyear, Ariz., Plainfield, Ind., Edgerton, Kan., Fort Worth, Texas, and Arlington, Texas. Most stations will open in 2019, the company said. UPS currently operates more than 50 natural gas fueling stations across the United States, as well as one in Vancouver, Canada, and one in Tamworth, United Kingdom."
6.0759770280543135," Blast damages Kentucky UPS facility, hurts two workers (Reuters) - Two United Parcel Service Inc employees were injured in an explosion on Wednesday that caused significant damage to one of the package delivery company’s freight facilities in Lexington, Kentucky, a UPS spokesman said. UPS said a gas leak from propane tanks inside a trailer may have caused the morning blast, some 80 miles east of Louisville. The company said the employees received minor injuries and that it shut down operations. UPS spokesman Glenn Zaccara said he did not know when operations were expected to resume or how much freight volume was disrupted by the blast. The Lexington Fire Department said six people were taken to a local hospital for observation after the blast. Fire officials said the explosion caused significant structural damage to a maintenance facility, with the walls and roof hardest hit. A photo released by the fire department appeared to show chunks of twisted metal and debris on the ground and roof in a loading area. The building was still standing. “Nothing leads us to believe this is anything other than an accidental explosion,” the fire department said in a string of tweets starting just after 8 a.m. EDT. The building was evacuated and all employees have been accounted for, the fire department said. UPS said it was working with authorities on an investigation."

6.377015855472816," UPS hits customers with new fees for oversized packages SEATTLE (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc UPS.N will begin charging an extra $150 next month to handle oversized packages and pallets, along with a new charge for packages with mislabeled dimensions, the company said on Wednesday. The new fees add to charges UPS announced last year for oversized items and come as the world’s largest package delivery company is investing billions of dollars to expand and automate its U.S. sorting facilities. UPS and rival FedEx Corp FDX.N currently deliver parcels up to 150 pounds (68 kg) to a person's doorstep. The charges are aimed at discouraging retailers from shipping heavier products that can bog down parcel sorting facilities, the company said. “It’s not a revenue-generating charge, its something we have increased regularly over time to encourage customers to ship through the UPS Freight network for these over max items,” said UPS spokesman Glenn Zaccara. From June 4, UPS is hiking per-package surcharges for pallets and packages heavier than 150 pounds from $500 to $650, a $150 increase, according to a May 11 message on its website. UPS is adding a new $1-per-package fee if retailers mislabel a package's dimensions. tinyurl.com/y9we7az9 “They are making it clear to customers that ‘we don’t want this oversized volume, and if you are going to ship it with us we are going to charge you an arm and a leg,’” said John Haber, chief executive officer of Spend Management Experts, a supply chain consultancy. “The sort facilities and conveyor systems are not equipped to handle packages that weigh 200 pounds. With the growth of e-commerce, retailers are shipping whatever they can and it’s very hard for UPS to manage that,” Haber said. The rise of e-commerce has forced UPS and FedEx to grapple with increased volumes of massive goods like sofas and televisions that consumers are increasingly buying online. UPS is working on a strategy to partner with at least one U.S. trucking firm to handle in-home delivery of heavy and bulky products. Beginning on July 8, UPS is raising the additional handling costs for packages weighing more than 70 pounds to $19 from $12, and to $90 from $80 for large packages delivered to a residential address, the company said in October."

7.542031105996913," Exclusive: UPS weighs strategy to deliver bulky goods to boost growth (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc UPS.N is in talks with at least one U.S. trucking firm to launch an in-home delivery service for large, heavy goods such as couches and treadmills, as the world's largest package deliverer looks to cash in on one the fastest growing segments of online retail. UPS and its rival FedEx Corp FDX.N currently deliver parcels up to 150 pounds (68.04 kg) in weight to a person's door step, and neither carries packages into a person's home or handles so-called ""white glove"" services such as product assembly or installation. UPS told Reuters it is now eyeing the furniture delivery business - one of the fastest-growing segments of online retail - with Amazon.com Inc AMZN.O, Wayfair Inc W.N and other e-commerce companies competing for market share against chains like Crate and Barrel and big-box stores. A source familiar with the matter said UPS is in talks to hire trucking company Werner Enterprises WERN.O to help it compete in this area, potentially by the end of the year. Werner launched its “final-mile” service in 2016, and has been building it out over the last year. Details of a potential partnership remain unclear given the early stages of the discussions, the source added. Werner declined to comment on the matter, and UPS would not identify who it is in talks with. Final-mile delivery is a market that Transport Futures economist Noel Perry said could grow to about $12 billion over the next decade, from about $3.7 billion today, thanks in large part to a growing appetite from younger consumers to buy everything from BBQ grills and mattresses to dining room tables online. “Outsourcing to a trucking firm would allow UPS to enter into the final-mile business without committing its own capital up front to expand its fleet or acquire end-of-line, final-mile infrastructure such as terminals,” R.W. Baird analyst Ben Hartford said. That could be welcome news to UPS investors waiting on Chief Executive David Abney’s promise to deliver higher margins by pumping billions of dollars into network upgrades and expansions. When asked about the strategy with bulky goods in an interview with Reuters, UPS Chief Operating Officer Jim Barber said the company has decided it can’t ignore the rising demand for in-home deliveries of furniture, mattresses, and treadmills, and was evaluating different ways to handle the larger cargo. “You got bigger products moving through networks across the globe,” said Chief Operating Officer Jim Barber. “What we have to do is try and figure out the right way to get them in the right network as we move forward.” Barber did not confirm talks with any specific company, and said that UPS has not made a final decision “because you have to balance it with our Express network, our labor constraints and our strategy going forward.” Other trucking players include Schneider National SNDR.N, Ryder System Inc R.N, Seko Logistics, and J.B. Hunt, which have expanded final-mile capabilities organically or through partnerships and acquisitions in recent years, hoping to lure major retailers with their scale. Schneider and XPO Logistics XPO.N, the largest provider of final-mile bulky deliveries in North America, told Reuters they had not met with UPS to discuss handling final-mile deliveries. J.B. Hunt and Ryder declined to comment. Seko did not immediately respond to a request for comment. As it is now, most of the major trucking and logistics firms in this final-mile bulky goods business hire regional contract-carriers – and there are hundreds nationwide – to haul products from warehouses to living rooms across the country. If UPS moves forward, it would give UPS’ retail customers including Wayfair, Amazon.com, Walmart Inc WMT.N, IKEA AB and Target Corp TGT.N a ""big and heavy option"" in their online shipping portals so consumers can receive shipments across the country, the source said. It could also set up UPS to hit its goal of being a one-stop shipping partner for retailers while also solving the problem of sofa-sized boxes unexpectedly showing up in trailers they pick up from retailer warehouses and take to parcel sorting hubs. UPS has worked for years to limit the sizes of unwieldy - or “non-conveyable” - items as it invests to speed up its package-sorting operation. It charges big premiums to handle the freight. UPS main rival FedEx said in March the expansion of its Memphis hub will include an area for oversized shipments and announced it bought UK-based deliverer P2P Mailing Limited. But a company spokesman said FedEx does not yet do in-home heavy goods deliveries in the United States. Entering the bulk goods delivery business adds new complexities and risks compared to traditional parcel delivery. For example, hauling a dresser to an upstairs bedroom and assembling it is a more intricate and physically demanding affair than dropping off a pallet at a warehouse’s loading dock. XPO Logistics’ Chief Information Officer Mario Harik said in an interview it was training drivers on etiquette and how to use mobile devices to log deliveries and customer complaints for large or heavy deliveries. Truckers can charge more for “white glove” services - which include varying degrees of installation, product assembly, and repairs - but the margins are often no better than other types of deliveries because stiff competition for new business has held down the prices carriers can charge retailers. But deliverers are hoping they can hike prices and boost margins as they increase delivery “density,” or the number of deliveries they make in a region on a given day, said Hartford, the R.W. Baird analyst. Heavy goods deliveries through UPS would likely include two workers willing to spend 20 minutes in a home, versus more complex installation and repairs, the source said. UPS declined to discuss the growth potential, but the source familiar with the strategy said UPS was looking initially for a trucking partner that could make or manage as many as “tens of thousands” of deliveries daily."

5.760147477445625," More parcels, higher prices lift UPS profit but costs soar NEW YORK (Reuters) - United Parcel Service Inc UPS.N reported higher first-quarter net profit on Thursday, driven by strong package volumes in its core U.S. segment, but higher costs from Saturday delivery and nasty winter weather weighed on the bottom line. Shares were up 2.2 percent in morning trade after the world’s largest package delivery company said revenue increased 10 percent to $17.1 billion in the first quarter from a year ago, topping analyst expectations of $16.47 billion. Revenue at its core U.S. package service rose 7.2 percent to $10.2 billion from a year-ago, driven by a 4.6-percent rise in parcel volumes that reflected growth of online purchases. However, severe winter weather dragged down its operating profit by $85 million, as did higher expenses for network improvements, higher pension costs, and a big expansion of Saturday delivery over the last year. Operating profit in its core domestic segment plummeted 20 percent, and was down 6 percent overall. “Higher costs continue to pressure earnings,” Cowen & Co analyst Helane Becker said in a research note. “In general, the company struggles with capacity issues during the peak season (the weeks leading up to Christmas), and could have issues achieving their EPS target unless their performance improves.” UPS, seen as an indicator of U.S. economic strength and consumer demand, reaffirmed its 2018 earnings per share range of $7.03 to $7.37 and maintained its 2018 spending plan of between $6.5 billion to $7 billion on network improvements like new technology and automating its parcel sorting hubs. Chief Executive David Abney has promised to deliver higher margins by pumping billions of dollars into network upgrades and expansions to handle the growth of e-commerce, as investors bristle over the costs. The rapid rise in online shopping has been a boon for shipping demand, but UPS has struggled to bring down the extra costs of delivering to households which on average receive fewer packages at one time than businesses. Revenue per parcel delivered rose just 2.6 percent, as higher prices and fuel surcharges offset the higher costs, the company said. Analysts on a conference call asked Abney about Amazon.com Inc's AMZN.O efforts to expand its own delivery capacity for volume traditionally handled by UPS and rival FedEx Corp FDX.N. “It’s very hard to predict what Amazon or any other of our large shippers are going to do,” Abney said, adding UPS would evaluate any market moves and react accordingly. UPS appears to be seeking out new ways to shave costs. On Wednesday, it offered early-retirement payouts to U.S. management employees, but declined to say how many employees it expects to leave. Abney also said UPS was making progress on non-wage matters during protracted negotiations with the Teamsters union on a contract ending July 31. UPS posted first-quarter net income of $1.35 billion or $1.55 per share, up from $1.17 billion or $1.33 per share a year earlier, a 17 percent rise on a per share basis. Analysts expected earnings per share of $1.54."

More than 43 million global consumers will get access to some 500 deals - like 10 percent off Goodyear tires, 20 percent off Neiman Marcus [NMRCUS.UL] luxury clothes, or the ability to donate half of one percent of an Amazon purchase to charity. UPS hopes to drum up more business and build brand loyalty for retailers, who hopefully would choose UPS over rival FedEx Corp FDX.N or other couriers, including Amazon's own logistics and delivery operations. ""If you are receiving something from Macy's M.N, you'll have an additional deal from Macy's right there in your alert,"" Stu Marcus, UPS vice president of customer technology marketing, said in an interview at its Atlanta headquarters. My Choice helps recipients track parcels to their door or choose alternative delivery locations, like an office or a UPS retail store. The program was launched in 2011 to cut higher costs associated with “last mile” delivery to residential addresses by reducing multiple delivery attempts, returns, and customer complaints to retailers. Robert W. Baird analyst Benjamin Hartford said the deals program is part of UPS’ efforts to increase the penetration of My Choice. “My Choice enhances customer satisfaction because it provides them more control,” Hartford said, adding that My Choice could streamline its network, speed up deliveries and reduce per-unit costs and improve margins. The discount program, tested over the last year and now being rolled out nationwide, reflects changes in UPS’ business, Marcus said. In 2011 deliveries to households amounted to about 40 percent of volume, with deliveries between businesses making up the rest. Currently, about half of volume goes directly to households. My Choice deals are sent to customers in banner ads attached to delivery notifications, or consumers can log into a website to peruse them, Marcus said. Discount loyalty programs have been long used by retailers, including Amazon's Prime membership, Groupon Inc GRPN.O, or Brad's Deals. UPS gets a commission on the deals for promoting the products, Marcus said, declining to discuss revenue expectations. “These are active customers receiving deliveries, so the customers who signed up for My Choice have already proven they are willing to receive goods and they are willing to order online. It is a very active group of customers that shippers want to be engaged with,” Marcus said."
