1.0949905815982608," Pet adoption, spending get a boost from pandemic: Zoetis CEO (Reuters) - The COVID-19 pandemic has given a boost to pet adoptions and prompted people to spend more on pet care, said Kristin Peck, chief executive of Zoetis Inc, the world’s largest animal health company, in an interview at the Reuters Next conference. Adoption rates at animal shelters have jumped about 15% as people try to cope with the isolation from lockdown orders to avoid the spread of the new coronavirus. Over 63 million American households owned dogs and nearly 43 million homes had cats as pets, according to a 2019 national survey by the American Pet Products Association. Zoetis has also seen an increase to e-commerce revenues as veterinarians provide care and send prescriptions over the internet, with online sales rising by about 70% during the pandemic, Peck said. The company is putting a halt to its political donations in light of last week’s assault on the United States Capitol by supporters of President Donald Trump, Peck added. “Similar to all companies we feel it’s best to put a halt to all donations” and make sure Zoetis’s political donations continue to align with its public policy goals, Peck said. Zoetis expects to see continued gains in its livestock business as a burgeoning global middle class continues to increase its consumption of protein, she added. The company continues to assess potential acquisitions but its unlikely to pursue any large deals as its existing scale in the animal health market could raise antitrust complications, Peck said."

15.473631494849618," Animal health leader Zoetis steps into pet insurance (Reuters) - Zoetis Inc ZTS.N, the world's largest animal health company, unveiled a new insurance unit in a bid to take advantage of rising pet ownership as Americans adopt furry companions to help relieve the loneliness of coronavirus lockdowns. Adoption rates at animal shelters around the world have jumped as people try to cope with the isolation from shelter-at-home orders to avoid the spread of the new coronavirus. New Jersey-based Zoetis on Thursday said its Pumpkin Insurance Services subsidiary will offer insurance plans to cover medical bills and veterinary visits for cat and dog owners. “Pet insurance is, more than ever before, top of the mind for pet owners who just got a new pet,” Alex Douzet, chief executive officer of Pumpkin, told Reuters. Historically, spending on pets has been found to increase during periods of recession and economic uncertainty, said Darryl Rawling, chief executive officer of Trupanion Inc TRUP.O, a rival pet insurance company. This is ideally when pet owners would consider seeking options such as pet insurance to avoid the risk of having to pay for costly medical procedures, Rawling added. Pet insurance, although not new in the United States, is an under-penetrated industry, and only 2% of owners have any sort of insurance for their pets, Pumpkin estimates. “If the pets go outside and become sick, or have an accident, pet insurance is one of the best ways to make sure that you can provide the right amount of care to your pets,” Douzet added. Companies such as Metlife Inc MET.N have also recently entered the pet insurance market, betting on a trend of ""pet humanization"" where owners are more willing to pay for expensive treatments for diseases including cancer. Depending on the pet’s age, breed and location, Pumpkin pet insurance members would pay around $1 to $3 a day for their premium, which covers 90% of eligible vet bills after members meet their annual deductible. Apart from that, it also offers an optional plan for $15.95 per month for dogs and $10.95 per month for cats, covering the full cost of an annual check-up, vaccines, as well as a 12-month supply of Zoetis’ parasite prevention products that would be shipped to members’ homes. Over 63 million American households owned dogs and nearly 43 million homes had cats as pets, according to a 2019 national survey by the American Pet Products Association. (bit.ly/2WfzKF5) On average, the annual costs per household on pets reached $662 in 2018, according to a survey by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics analyzed by a unit of LendingTree TREE.O."

3.7298036547210014," Factbox: Animal health sector aims to emulate Zoetis biotech leap (Reuters) - A commercial breakthrough in the field of complex therapeutic proteins for dogs by sector leader Zoetis ZTS.N has roused rivals to action in a hunt for biotechnology medicines to treat pets. Previously reserved for humans, biotech drugs made from genetically engineered living cells are now seen as ripe for the pet health market. The following are some of the recent deals, launches and development projects in the space: - British animal health company Dechra Pharmaceuticals Inc DPH.L agreed to a deal www.akstonbio.com in August to utilize development work by U.S. insulin specialist Akston Biosciences for a once weekly shot for diabetic dogs to replace daily injections, with a view to expanding the collaboration to cats. Dechra has said long-acting insulin, which is typically produced from genetically modified bacteria, should become its biggest product. - U.S. animal health company Kindred Biosciences Inc KIN.O, which repurposed a human antidepressant to stimulate appetite in underweight cats, has several genetically engineered biologic drugs under development kindredbio.com/pipeline, targeting diseases such as dermatitis in dogs and anemia in cats. - German early-stage biotech research firm Adivo in April signed a global collaboration deal here with Bayer's BAYGn.DE animal health unit a little over a year after Adivo was spun out of human biotech firm Morphosys MORG.DE with a mission to develop antibodies for dogs. - Privately-held German drugmaker Boehringer Ingelheim, the global No. 2 in animal health, in April launched here the first stem cell-based veterinary medicine to treat lameness in horses caused by inflamed joints, a common worry for both recreational and competitive riders. - Industry leader Zoetis Inc ZTS.N, which has a successful anti-itch biotech drug for dogs on the market, said here in August it was seeking approval for more antibodies, targeting osteoarthritic pain in cats with plans for a 2021 market launch, drawing on its 2017 acquisition of Nexvet Biopharma. A similar product for dogs is also in the pipeline. - In June of 2018, Zoetis signed a deal here with human biotech firm Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc REGN.O to adopt its antibody technology for animals, targeting inflammatory disease and cancer."
3.7298036547210014," Biotech is going to the dogs - and big profits await (Reuters) - For Jessica Lescault there is no question that her 6-year old English bulldog “Moose” deserves cutting-edge biotechnology cancer treatment as much as any human patient. “Pets are your loved ones, pets should be your family, pets are not something you keep on a chain in the backyard,” the intensive-care nurse from Somers, Connecticut, said. Lescault, 43, who enrolled Moose in a clinical trial of an experimental drug designed to help his immune system fight his cancer, represents the type of pet lover that has spurred animal health companies around the globe to invest in developing complex new treatments previously reserved for humans. Biotechnology, which produces medicines from living cells, revolutionized the drug industry more than a quarter century ago with breakthrough medicines at prices that now run as high as hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. In recent years, the cost of genetic testing and biotech drug production has fallen sharply, making biotechnology for pets financially viable at much lower prices, industry experts said. For a FACTBOX, click Sector leader Zoetis ZTS.N and others say animal drug development is faster, less expensive and more predictable than drugs for people. “It’s not nearly as common for pivotal studies to fail in animal health as it is in human medicine. Most of them are successful,” said Cheryl London, professor in comparative oncology at Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine at Tufts University in Massachusetts. Biotech drugs for pets, if proven safe and effective, would be a boon to a $44 billion veterinary medicines market currently dominated by vaccines, flea and tick repellents and anti-infectives. A recent product launch has galvanized the industry. Cytopoint for canine itch relief sold by Zoetis reached blockbuster status by animal health standards in its second year on the market. Launched in late 2016, Cytopoint generated 2018 sales of $129 million, and first-quarter 2019 sales jumped 65% from a year earlier. Produced from cloned genetically engineered hamster cells over at least eight bio-processing steps, the monoclonal antibody is no less complex than comparable therapeutic proteins used in human medicine. But the cost to consumers is far less. Like many biotech drugs, dose and cost is determined by weight. Zoetis declined to disclose its prices. But an animal hospital in Stamford, Connecticut, for example, charges $104 for a 40-pound (18 kg) dog. For much smaller dogs, a Cytopoint injection, which lasts about four to eight weeks, costs about $35 to $50. To keep a large dog from scratching itself raw could run $140 per shot. The cost of a highly effective new anti-itch biotech drug to treat severe atopic dermatitis in humans can run about $30,000 a year. ‘TURNING POINT’ “Cytopoint was a turning point that has made it clear that (biotech drugs) can be successful in this space,” London said. “Now there are an estimated five to ten companies developing antibodies for the veterinary market.” That has created increased business for related services. “It’s a big challenge for us to keep up with the pace of demand growth,” said Klaus Hellmann, managing director at Munich-based Klifovet AG, Europe’s largest contractor for late-stage clinical trials of veterinary drugs. While Cytopoint sparked investment interest in biotech treatments for animals, drug development still comes with inherent risks and uncertainty. Aratana Therapeutics Inc’s canine lymphoma drug, Blontress, was launched in 2015, but later withdrawn after scientific data led the company to determine it was unlikely to be a financial success. Declining costs has mitigated some of the risk. “Over the past several years, human health has been able to advance the technology to improve efficiency of their cell production systems,” said Rob Polzer, head of global therapeutics research for Zoetis. Zoetis can repurpose and optimize existing procedures, mechanisms of action and technologies, it said. The company is seeking approval for a biotech medicine to treat osteoarthritic pain in cats, with plans for a 2021 market launch and a similar product for dogs thereafter. Others have jumped on the bandwagon. German start-up Adivo was spun out of biotech firm Morphosys MORG.DE in March 2018 out of frustration by its founders that scientific advances for humans were not translating into better treatment options for their dogs. It has since struck a global collaboration deal with Bayer's BAYGn.DE animal health unit for its early-stage research platform for animal-specific monoclonal antibodies - the backbone of biotechnology. “Over the last few years, the veterinary market has seen an incredibly dynamic development,” said Adivo co-founder Kathrin Ladetzki-Baehs. This could prove a lifesaver for Moose, the bulldog in the oncology drug trial. In early August, Lescault discovered a mass on Moose’s throat, soon followed by deteriorating health and a diagnosis of canine B-cell lymphoma. Moose was given one to two months to live without treatment or about a year with 25 weeks of punishing chemotherapy. Lescault’s local vet suggested the Tufts trial testing an experimental protein that could help advance the current immuno-oncology craze into the animal health arena. Tufts declined to disclose the compound or the study’s sponsor. But more than three weeks into the trial, Moose’s cough and labored breathing has disappeared and he is back to his playful and boisterous self, Lescault said. While treatment in a clinical trial is free, Lescault said she would not hesitate to pay thousands of dollars for a safe and effective drug to save Moose. “I wouldn’t blink an eye,” she said. That is exactly what drug companies are banking on."
10.651058739600796," Zoetis to buy veterinary diagnostics firm Abaxis for $1.9 billion (Reuters) - Top animal health company Zoetis Inc ZTS.N will buy Abaxis Inc ABAX.O for $1.9 billion, looking to capture a bigger slice of the fast-growing market for diagnostics services that cater to household pets and farm animals. The deal announced Wednesday reflects Zoetis’ expectation that the diagnostics category will grow at a faster pace than the broader animal health industry. Abaxis — which makes blood and urine tests to predict, detect and treat diseases such as heartworm, Lyme disease or tick-borne infections — will also help its New Jersey-based acquirer bolster its presence in overseas markets. Zoetis faces much lesser competition internationally than in the United States, its Chief Executive Officer Juan Alaix said on a conference call with analysts. “The characteristic of patients in animal health is that they don’t speak. So in our industry, almost every animal getting into clinics needs to have a diagnostic test,” Alaix said. The veterinary diagnostics market worldwide is expected grow to $3.6 billion in 2022 from $2.3 billion in 2017, according to research firm MarketsandMarkets here. By contrast, the global animal medicines and vaccines market is worth around $30 billion, according to veterinary consultancy Vetnosis. Much of Zoetis’ revenue is driven by its animal dermatology business, and diagnostics contribute just under 1 percent of its overall annual revenue of more than $5 billion. On Wednesday, Zoetis' shares fell 0.5 percent, while shares of IDEXX Laboratories Inc IDXX.O, Abaxis' biggest competitor, fell 3.7 percent. “We believe this is a good deal for Zoetis although the valuation seems high,” BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei said. Shares of Abaxis rose as much as 16 percent to an all-time high of $83.24, inching past Zoetis’ all-cash offer price of $83 per share. At seven times Abaxis’ annual revenue, the price Zoetis is paying is already “pretty steep,” said C.L. King and Associates analyst David Westenberg. “If there’s another bidder, I don’t think Zoetis would go any higher,” he said. However, should there be a rival offer, the companies most likely to make a bid would be Eli Lilly and Co's LLY.N animal health unit Elanco or candy and pet food company Mars Inc, Westenberg said. Other possible bidders include dental supply firms Henry Schein Inc HSIC.O and Patterson Companies Inc PDCO.O, which also have animal health divisions, he added. Zoetis plans to fund the acquisition through cash and new debt. It expects the deal to close before the end of the year and Abaxis to add to its earnings in 2019."
