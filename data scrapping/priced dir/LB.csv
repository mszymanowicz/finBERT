36.98772207197836," L Brands long-time CFO Stuart Burgdoerfer to retire in August Feb 4 (Reuters) - L Brands Inc, owner of Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works, said on Thursday that Chief Financial Officer Stuart Burgdoerfer will retire in August after more than 14 years on the job. The Columbus, Ohio-based company also said it was aiming to complete the separation of its Victoria’s Secret and Bath & Body Works businesses by August and Burgdoerfer will continue to oversee the split. All options, including a spin-off of the Victoria’s Secret business into a public company or a private sale of the business, were being evaluated, L Brands said. Burgdoerfer, who is also stepping down from the position of interim chief executive officer of the Victoria’s Secret unit, will be succeeded by the lingerie business head Martin Waters, effective immediately. The company said it has initiated the search for a new financial chief. Prior to his 14-year stint as the finance chief, Burgdoerfer started out in L Brands as an executive vice-president in 1998. Separately, L Brands also raised its forecast for current quarter profit to $2.95 to $3.00 per share from $2.70 to $2.80 after reporting upbeat sales for the holiday season, sending shares up nearly 4% on Thursday.

45.22463417957055," L Brands results beat on home fragrances, lingerie demand (Reuters) - L Brands Inc LB.N posted better-than-expected quarterly results on Wednesday, helped by record sales growth at Bath & Body Works and higher demand for Victoria's Secret lingerie, sending the company's shares 16% higher in extended trading. A sharper focus on hygiene standards during the COVID-19 pandemic has boosted sales of soaps, lotions and sanitizers at Bath & Body Works, with consumers staying indoors also spending on scented candles. The business posted a 56% jump in comparable sales in the third quarter. L Brands also saw a 4% rise in comparable sales at Victoria’s Secret, as the business benefited from the relaunch of its “Body by Victoria” lingerie line and higher demand for sleepwear from customers “nesting” at home. Chief Executive Officer Andrew Meslow said customers’ early response to the holiday shopping season was encouraging, but the company remained cautious due to COVID-19. “We are cautious about our ability to exceed last year’s fourth quarter sales and earnings results, given anticipated constraints on store traffic, online fulfillment and shipping capacity,” he said. Net income came in at $330.6 million, or $1.17 per share, for the three months ended Oct. 31, compared with a loss of $252 million, or 91 cents per share, a year earlier, when it recorded some impairment charges. On an adjusted basis, it earned $1.13 per share, more than analysts’ average estimate of 9 cents per share, Refinitiv IBES data showed. Net sales rose 14% to $3.06 billion, easily exceeding expectations of $2.67 billion."

35.170784578965176," L Brands reports surprise profit on demand for soaps, lingerie (Reuters) - L Brands Inc LB.N on Wednesday reported a surprise quarterly profit boosted by strong demand for Bath & Body Works' sanitizers and soaps, as well as higher online sales of Victoria's Secret lingerie during coronavirus-led lockdowns. The pandemic-fuelled temporary store closures, which have pushed many retailers into bankruptcy, led to 850 jobs cuts at L Brand’s home office and permanent closing of some Victoria’s Secret stores, after a stake sale in the unit fell apart. The company’s direct channel, which includes its online store that remained open throughout the quarter, proved to be a bright spot as customers flocked to shop virtually. That helped comparable sales for Bath & Body Works surge 123%, while that for Victoria’s Secret rise 28%. Overall comparable sales rose 63% for L Brands, crushing the average analyst estimate of an 18% fall, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. “Q2 2020 was much stronger than expected... The key question for management will be whether the company will be able to maintain this strength through holiday,” Bernstein analyst Jamie Merriman said. With the busy holiday season soon approaching, L Brands said it was testing ideas to spread its holiday merchandise to a broader time period, and to introduce some merchandise into the current quarter. It also forecast “meaningful expense pressure” due to higher store costs that include payroll and supplies, due to social distancing protocols, wage rate inflation and higher shipping costs. Excluding one-time items, the company earned 25 cents per share in the quarter ended Aug. 1, compared with the expectation of a 42 cents loss. Net sales fell about 20% to $2.32 billion, but were above Wall Street estimates of $2.21 billion. Shares of the Columbus, Ohio-based company were up 4% in extended trading."

Shares of the company surged 17% in extended trading after the Victoria’s Secret owner also said its cost-cutting efforts, including layoffs and inventory management, would help it save about $400 million annually. L Brands is focusing on its high-margin Bath and Body Works division as the COVID-19 pandemic drives customers to stock up on personal care products such as hand sanitizers. Columbus, Ohio-based L Brands estimated a 10% rise in second-quarter revenue for the brand, even as it expects total net sales to be down about 20% from a year earlier. Analysts on average were expecting total net sales to decline about 35% to $1.9 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. “BBW is being helped by hand sanitizer while its candle sales slow. Sanitizer has been a lifesaver,” Jefferies analyst Randal Konik said. The company projected a drop of about 40% in sales at its Victoria’s Secret unit, which it plans to run as a separate, standalone company after failing to sell a majority stake to private-equity firm Sycamore Partners. L Brands has reopened most Bath & Body Works and Victoria’s Secret Stores in North America after the easing of coronavirus-induced lockdowns. The company is expected to report results on Aug. 19."

119.6213425129088," Who won the Victoria’s Secret M&A case? (Reuters) - The parent company of Victoria’s Secret, L Brands, announced Monday that it was ditching its attempt to compel the private equity firm Sycamore Partners to complete a $525 million deal to purchase a majority stake in the lingerie business. L Brands, which also owns Bath & Body Works and plans to take that business public, said it will make deep cuts at Victoria’s Secret “rather than engaging in costly and distracting litigation to force a partnership with Sycamore.” That sure sounds like a retreat by L Brands – especially because Sycamore’s subsequent press release disclosed that the private equity firm will not even pay a breakup fee to exit its agreement to buy 55% of Victoria’s Secret. Under the terms of their deal, L Brands was entitled to as much as $40 million in money damages if Sycamore bailed. L Brands included a demand for money damages in its April 23 complaint against Sycamore. But it decided not to forge on with that demand. Want more On the Case? Listen to the On the Case podcast. Sycamore, in other words, got everything it wanted when it initiated a showdown with L Brands in Delaware Chancery Court on April 22, seeking a declaration that it was not required to complete the $525 million deal. The private equity fund has managed to get out of the agreement without paying L Brands anything. And because of the quick end to the litigation, Sycamore won’t even be on the hook for the legal fees it would have had to pay its lawyers at Kirkland & Ellis and Richards Layton & Finger if the case had endured through expedited briefing and a trial scheduled for late July before Vice-Chancellor Travis Laster. It’s entirely possible that L Brands’ decision to abandon the deal was not based on the strength or weakness of its case against Sycamore or Sycamore’s case against it. If L Brands’ Davis Polk & Wardwell lawyers had prevailed and forced Sycamore to complete the deal, after all, L Brands would have been stuck as the minority stakeholder in a business controlled by a recalcitrant private equity fund – not exactly a desirable scenario. And L Brands certainly had at least one very strong argument for compelling Sycamore to complete the deal: The material adverse event clause of their Feb. 20 purchase agreement, as I told you when this litigation began, included a pandemic carve-out. The carve-out meant that Sycamore, not L Brands, bore the risk that the already-emerging coronavirus would impair Victoria’s Secret’s business. But Sycamore offered two intriguing theories in this case, one that could have set precedent on interpreting MAE clauses and another that might have spelled a quick and brutal loss for L Brands. We’ll never know if either of Sycamore’s legal theories would have won the case. We do know that the dispute ended with the private equity fund getting all that it wanted. So, considering the outcome, it’s worth taking a closer look at Sycamore’s arguments. The fund’s original theory, set out in the declaratory judgment complaint that initiated the litigation in Chancery Court, was that L Brands materially breached its contractual obligation to continue operating Victoria’s Secret in the ordinary course of business. Sycamore didn’t contest Victoria’s Secret store closures in response to COVID-19 but argued that L Brands irreparably damaged the business by furloughing employees, cutting executive salaries, refusing to accept new inventory and skipping rent payments. Those actions, Sycamore alleged, meant that L Brands could not meet the deal conditions it promised to satisfy at the time of closing. It’s not clear whether Sycamore would have had to prove merely that L Brands failed to live up to its representations and warranties or whether it would have had to show that those failures constituted a material adverse event. That’s where the MAE clause gets interesting. As I mentioned, the clause contained a carve-out for the effects of a pandemic on Victoria’s Secret stores. But the pandemic carve-out applied only to one provision of the MAE clause. There were no carve outs, for pandemics or any other disasters, in a separate provision that defined a material adverse condition as any event or circumstance “that would prevent, materially delay or materially impede” L Brands’ ability to meet its obligations. Sycamore contended that because L Brands’ drastic response to the pandemic was outside of the ordinary course of business, the response would prevent L Brands from meeting its contractual obligations, thus triggering the MAE provision that did not include a carve-out for the pandemic. That sounds like circular logic, but Sycamore may have been able to find support for it in a 2014 Chancery Court ruling in Cooper Tire v. Apollo (Mauritius) Holdings, which involved the unraveling of an Indian tire company’s deal to acquire the American company. Cooper workers in China and the U.S. vehemently opposed the deal, which led Apollo to drag its feet on completing the acquisition. The deal ultimately died, but Cooper wanted Apollo to pay a breakup fee. Vice-Chancellor Samuel Glasscock ended up holding that because the deal’s MAE provision included a clause that broadly defined an MAE as an event preventing Cooper from complying with its obligations, Apollo was not required to pay the breakup fee. Like the MAE provision in the Victoria’s Secret case, the Cooper Tire MAE provision included one clause with carve-outs that shifted risk onto the buyer, but Apollo pointed to a second, broadly-worded clause – to which the carve-outs did not apply – to evade the break-up fee. Sycamore would undoubtedly have argued that, like Apollo, it was the beneficiary of the MAE provision with no carve-outs. Like I said, we’ll never know if Vice-Chancellor Laster would have agreed that L Brands triggered that MAE clause by allegedly breaching its contractual obligations, but it’s notable that Sycamore made the argument. Sycamore’s alternative theory was much simpler: In a complaint filed on April 24 – two days after its original complaint and a day after L Brands’ countersuit – Sycamore alleged that its agreement to commit equity to the Victoria’s Secret deal was void because L Brands had included a claim for money damages against Sycamore in its April 23 complaint. The private equity fund’s agreement to commit $500 million to the subsidiaries that would buy a stake in Victoria’s Secret prohibited L Brands from suing Sycamore for money damages, according to Sycamore’s April 24 suit. (Sycamore asserted that L Brands retained a right, under the equity commitment agreement, only to demand specific performance of the purchase agreement.) The private equity fund said that as a result of L Brands’ demand, it was no longer obligated to fund the deal. If Sycamore had prevailed – and I suspect it would have pushed for quick summary judgment on the issue – the deal would effectively have been over. Of course, L Brands would doubtless have argued that the equity commitment letter, which was not publicly disclosed in its entirety, was more complex than Sycamore asserted and that its claim for money damages as an alternative to completion of the purchase agreement did not void Sycamore’s funding obligation. Again, we’ll never know which side would have won the fight, or even if L Brands chose to walk away because it feared losing the case. Maybe the company made an entirely rational decision not to spend money litigating to compel a poisoned partnership. But if we can anoint victors in dropped suits, it’s clear who won this one."
107.22592192691032," L Brands, Sycamore agree to call off Victoria's Secret deal (Reuters) - L Brands Inc LB.N said on Monday it has agreed to call off the sale of its majority stake in Victoria's Secret lingerie business to buyout firm Sycamore, averting a bitter legal battle between the two companies over the $525 million deal. Shares of the Columbus, Ohio-based L Brands fell 11% in extended trading. The company said instead it was preparing to operate Victoria’s Secret as well as its personal care brand Bath & Body Works as separate, standalone units. L Brands said it was in its best interests to focus on navigating an extremely challenging business environment rather than engaging in costly and distracting litigation to force a partnership with Sycamore. Sycamore Partners, which had agreed to buy a 55% stake in the Victoria’s Secret business in February, said neither party would be required to pay a termination fee and that both sides have agreed to settle all pending litigation. Sycamore filed a legal complaint in late April, alleging that L Brands breached the terms of the deal by closing nearly all of its about 1,600 Victoria’s Secret and PINK stores globally, including more than a thousand stores in North America without Sycamore’s permission. L Brands had then said it planned to challenge the move. The company said on Monday its board has appointed Chief Financial Officer Stuart Burgdoerfer as the interim chief executive officer of Victoria’s Secret. The leadership changes announced earlier this year, including that of L brands CEO Leslie Wexner stepping down, would be effective later this month, it said."

90.48086359175663," Sycamore Partners backs out of coronavirus-stricken deal for Victoria's Secret (Reuters) - Buyout firm Sycamore Partners disclosed on Wednesday it had walked away from a $525 million deal to acquire a majority stake in Victoria’s Secret, after the lingerie brand shut down stores and furloughed staff in response to the coronavirus outbreak. Victoria's Secret owner L Brands Inc LB.N vowed to challenge the move, setting up the first high-profile U.S. legal fight over the termination of a merger agreement because of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has shut down large swaths of the economy. In a Delaware court filing, Sycamore said that L Brands had breached the terms of the deal, signed on Feb. 20, by closing nearly all of its about 1,600 Victoria’s Secret and PINK stores globally, including more than a thousand stores in North America, without Sycamore’s permission. L Brands also furloughed most of its Victoria’s Secret employees and reduced compensation for senior staff and took other actions that could hurt the lingerie business, such as not paying rent or taking receipt of new merchandise, Sycamore said in the filing. “That these actions were taken as a result of or in response to the COVID-19 pandemic is no defense to L Brands’ clear breaches of the transaction agreement,” Sycamore said in its complaint. L Brands said that Sycamore’s termination of the transaction agreement was invalid and that it would pursue all legal remedies to enforce its contractual rights, including the right of “specific performance” for a judge to force completion of the deal. L Brands shares dropped 15.5% Wednesday to $13.78. While Victoria’s Secret, known for its crystal encrusted bras and voluptuous models, is one of the most high-profile deals to result in litigation since the coronavirus outbreak, it is not the only one that has been affected. Last month, U.S. auto parts company BorgWarner Inc BWA.N threatened to walk away from a $951 million deal to buy Delphi Technologies DLPH.N, after the automotive equipment supplier drew down a credit line without its acquirer’s approval. BorgWarner said the move breached their deal terms and gave Delphi 30 days to ""cure"" the issue. A special committee for co-working company WeWork earlier this month sued its investor, SoftBank Group 9984.T for ditching a $3 billion tender offer, accusing it of buyer's remorse.Retailer Bed, Bath & Beyond Inc BBY.O this month also asked a judge to hold 1-800-Flowers.com Inc FLWS.O accountable for a $252 million deal. Merger agreements routinely include contractual provisions to protect the parties involved, citing earthquakes, pandemics and ‘acts of God’ as possible ways out of a deal. While L Brands’ deal with Sycamore has a carve-out to prevent the acquirer from citing a pandemic’s impact on Victoria Secret’s business as grounds to walk away, the private equity firm argued in its filing that this did not cover the breach that had transpired. “L Brands will no doubt counter, ‘Are you serious, we should have defied the government’s order to keep our stores open?’ But Sycamore still has a potential claim, notwithstanding the public relations hit they’re going to take,” Columbia Law School professor Eric Talley said in an interview after reviewing Sycamore’s complaint. While Sycamore said in its complaint that L Brands rejected its request to renegotiate the deal price, Talley said it was possible that the companies could settle and restructure the deal. Under its agreement with Sycamore, L Brands would keep a 45% stake in Victoria’s Secret. The divestment would allow L Brands to focus on its better-performing Bath & Body Works brand, a seller of soaps and lotions, located mostly in malls across the United States."
90.48086359175663," Sycamore Partners invokes MAE clause in bid to escape Victoria’s Secret deal (Reuters) - The private equity firm Sycamore Partners sued Victoria’s Secret parent L Brands Wednesday in Delaware Chancery Court, seeking to end its deal to acquire a 55% stake in the lingerie brand. Notably, Sycamore seems to be the first post-COVID-19 M&A buyer to claim that its target has experienced a material adverse effect that entitles the purchaser to walk away from the deal. The complaint alleges that the Feb. 20 transaction agreement between L Brands and a Sycamore subsidiary required the Victoria’s Secret parent to run the business “in the ordinary course consistent with past practice.” But according to the complaint, L Brands took actions in response to COVID-19 that breached its commitments in the deal agreement. Specifically, the complaint alleged, L Brands furloughed Victoria’s Secret employees, cut executives’ salaries, refused to receive new merchandise and failed to pay April rents at brick-and-mortar stores. Sycamore’s lawyers at Kirkland & Ellis and Richards Layton & Finger argued that flagging morale, obsolete wares and poisoned relationships with landlords have “caused incalculable damage to the Victoria’s Secret business.” Want more On the Case? Listen to the On the Case podcast. L Brands counsel William Aaronson of Davis Polk & Wardwell did not respond to my email requesting comment. Interestingly, the deal contract’s MAE clause included a COVID-19 carve-out for “any state of facts, circumstance, condition, event, change, development, occurrence, result or effect to the extent directly or indirectly resulting from … pandemics.” But according to the Sycamore complaint, the pandemic carve-out does not apply to a different section of the MAE clause. That section defines a material adverse condition as any event or circumstance “that would prevent, materially delay or materially impede” L Brands’ ability to meet its obligations. By allegedly breaching its agreement to run the business in the ordinary course, the suit alleged, L Brands failed to meet the pre-conditions for the deal and triggered the MAE clause. The specifics of the contract are unique and complex, of course, but I was lucky enough to get some insight from University of Michigan law professor Albert Choi, who specializes in corporate and contract law and has a particular expertise in MAE clauses. Choi, who reviewed both the complaint and publicly-filed transaction agreement, said the apparently limited scope of the pandemic carve-out “seems to make (Sycamore’s) arguments stronger.” Choi said it’s unusual for an MAE carve-out to be as selective as the pandemic clause in the Victoria’s Secret deal and hypothesized that Sycamore’s lawyers may be due credit for “very clever lawyering.” (A Sycamore spokesman declined to comment.) Delaware courts, as you probably know, have historically been exceedingly reluctant to allow buyers to invoke MAE clauses to escape from M&A deals. The only decision in which a Delaware Chancery Court judge found that a target company had experienced a material adverse event was 2018’s Akorn v. Fresenius Kabi AG, which allowed Fresenius to terminate its agreement to acquire the generics drug-maker after Akorn was hit with unexpected competition for leading products and was beset by regulatory problems. The Akorn decision was widely regarded as an anomaly – a perception that’s been validated by the scarcity of MAE assertions since COVID-19 began to affect M&A deals. Kyle Wagner Compton of The Chancery Daily has been tracking new Delaware suits arising from the pandemic. In a newsletter written before Sycamore’s complaint against L Brands, Compton observed that for all of the talk about deal participants invoking MAE clauses in response to COVID-19, parties in actual litigation hadn’t done so. Instead, Compton said, they’ve relied on other contract provisions. (A couple of suits on Wagner’s list have raised the prospect that future events could trigger MAE clauses; others have noted pandemic carve-outs from MAE provisions.) Choi told me he’s not surprised that buyers have not invoked MAE clauses en masse. For one thing, he said, the provisions typically don’t allow buyers to walk away based on changes in general economic conditions or broad declines in financial markets. Disillusioned buyers, he said, would generally have to show that their now-unwanted target experienced a disproportionate downturn amid overall economic bad news. Moreover, he said, the Akorn decision specifically noted that Akorn’s problems were not momentary but were “durationally significant.” Choi said courts want evidence that the effect of an adverse event will last for years. We’re just months into the COVID-19 fallout, he said, so it’s not clear if buyers can show that targets have experienced consequences that will dim their long-term prospects. I’ve been surprised, frankly, that we haven’t seen more M&A litigation from deals struck before companies understood the full impact of COVID-19 shutdowns. It will be interesting to look back in several months to see if the Sycamore suit is a turning point or an outlier."

The moves come after activist investor Barington Capital last year bought a small stake and urged the company to split fast growing Bath & Body Works from Victoria’s Secret, push Wexner to give up his CEO position and refresh the board, where the majority of directors were men. Barington serves as an adviser to the company. L Brands, which has a market valuation of about $7 billion, has seen sales dwindle at its Victoria’s Secret business as it faces increased competition from online retailers. It has been criticized for an outdated brand image and for lingerie that was not inclusive of all body types. The brand accounted for nearly half of the company’s $13.24 billion revenue in 2019, but has seen sales decline for at least four quarters. Bath & Body Works’ revenue has risen. “We believe this structure will allow Bath & Body Works to continue to achieve strong growth and receive its appropriate market valuation,” said Wexner, who owns a 13.24% stake in L Brands and has been leading the company since 1963, making him the longest-serving CEO of a S&P 500 company. The company last year canceled its fashion show and Edward Razek, its chief marketing officer, who was closely associated with the shows, left."

-44.28174879797029," L Brands CEO in talks to step aside and sell Victoria's Secret: WSJ (Reuters) - Victoria's Secret-owner L Brands LB.N Chief Executive Officer Leslie Wexner is in talks to step aside from the role and is exploring strategic alternatives for the lingerie brand, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday. L Brands is in discussions with private-equity firm Sycamore Partners for a full or partial sale of Victoria's Secret, the report here said, citing people familiar with the matter. The nearly $6-billion company has faced slumping sales at the lingerie giant in recent quarters and has drawn criticism from an activist investor and increasing competition from online retailers. Shares of the company jumped 12%. L Brands declined to comment on the report. “Fresh perspective would likely be a positive in ‘righting the ship’,” Jefferies analysts said in a note. The analysts cautioned that bulls are over-valuing the Bath & Body Works unit and under estimating challenges for Victoria’s Secret. Wexner, 82, has been leading the company since 1963, making him the longest-serving CEO of an S&P 500 company. Wexner built Victoria’s Secret, The Limited and Abercrombie & Fitch into national chains, taking on department store stalwarts by focusing on specialty brands. Wexner is the company’s largest shareholder with a stake of 13.24%, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. Wexner has been in focus for his association with the late financier Jeffrey Epstein, who was entrusted with managing the billionaire’s personal finances and served as trustee of his charitable foundation. Wexner has not been accused of criminal wrongdoing. Epstein was indicted last year after being charged with trafficking dozens of underage girls as young as 14 from at least 2002 to 2005. He died in prison in New York in August. Wexner ended his association with Epstein more than a decade ago, according to previous reporting in the Wall Street Journal. In March, Barington Capital urged the company to separate the roles of chairman and chief executive. The company also called for the sale of the struggling lingerie brand. Victoria’s Secret accounted for nearly half of the company’s $13.24 billion revenue in 2019. Sales at Victoria’s Secret have fallen for at least four quarters. The brand was once the destination for all things lingerie and has been losing customers as more women shift to cheaper bralettes and sports bras from companies like American Eagle Outfitter's AEO.N Aerie and pop singer Rihanna's lingerie line, Savage X Fenty. Earlier this month, L Brands lowered its profit forecast for the fourth quarter after reporting a 3% drop in comparable store sales for the holiday period. L Brands has tried to update marketing strategy for Victoria’s Secret. L Brands marketing chief Edward Razek announced plans to resign last year. Late last year, the company canceled its annual Victoria’s Secret fashion show, known for its jewel-encrusted bras and supermodels sporting angel wings. “Much work we think needs to be done to reinvent the brand for the ‘inclusive’ era,” said CFRA Research analyst Camilla Yanushevsky."

35.29793960967753," Victoria's Secret holiday fashion show canceled as marketing plans 'evolve' (Reuters) - The annual Victoria’s Secret fashion show, known for its jewel-encrusted bras and supermodels sporting angel wings, will not be held this holiday season, parent L Brands Inc said on Thursday. The decision comes after the apparel retailer said in May the TV special was not going to be part of network television as the company evaluates its marketing strategy for the show. The brand was once the destination for all things lingerie and has been losing customers as more women shift to cheaper bralettes and sports bras from companies like American Eagle Outfitter’s Aerie and pop singer Rihanna’s lingerie line, Savage X Fenty. Television audiences for the show have slumped in the last few years. The December 2018 show, aired on Walt Disney Co’s ABC network, was watched by 3.3 million Americans, compared with 12 million in 2001 when it was first broadcast. When asked if the fashion show would be held this holiday season, Chief Financial Officer Stuart Burgdoerfer said: “No, we’ll be communicating to customers, but nothing that I would say is similar in magnitude to the fashion show.” “We think it’s important to evolve the marketing of Victoria’s Secret,” he said on the earnings call on Thursday. The company, which forecast an upbeat holiday season on Wednesday, said it was not commenting further at this time."
4.065886832098049," L Brands says hedge fund to withdraw board nominees after reaching agreement (Reuters) - L Brands said on Thursday activist investor Barington Capital has agreed to withdraw its proposed board nominees and instead will serve as a special adviser as part of an agreement with the company. The agreement comes a month after Barington urged the company to either explore a spin off of the underperforming Victoria’s Secret brand or take the much financially stronger Bath & Body Works public. Barington would now vote in favor of the entire L Brands board nominees at its 2019 annual shareholder meeting, the company said here. As a special adviser, Barington would provide consulting and advisory services to the company for its business, operations, strategic and financial matters, the composition of the board and potential candidates for nomination. L Brands also announced on Thursday a slate of director nominees for election to the board, which includes three independent directors. The company’s nominees include its Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Leslie Wexner. In March, Barington had also suggested that the role of chairman and chief executive officer be held by separate individuals, an increasingly popular demand by activist investors who feel it would help companies run better."

Barington urged the company to retain advisers and explore either a spin off of the underperforming Victoria’s Secret brand or take the much financially stronger Bath & Body Works public. The hedge fund also suggested that the role of chairman and chief executive officer be held by separate individuals, an increasingly popular demand by activist investors who feel it would help companies run better. In a letter to L Brands’ chairman Leslie Wexner, Barington said the “true potential” of Bath & Body Works had not been realized because of years of weak performance at Victoria’s, stemming from a failure to maintain a strong brand image and missteps with merchandising. Barington did not disclose the size of its ownership stake in L Brands. It did not immediately respond to emails seeking details. Shares in L Brands rose as much as 6 percent on Tuesday, having fallen last week after reporting poor quarterly results. L Brands said in a statement it welcomed open communication with shareholders and “values input that may advance our goal of enhancing shareholder value.” It also highlighted changes it had already made to its business, including closing or selling some brands, while appointing new leadership at others. “The company has significantly underperformed its peers and the market as a whole,” Barington Chairman James Mitarotonda said. Mitarotonda also expressed concern over a lack of diversity on L Brands’ board — nine of its 12 directors are men — and pointed out that some directors had sat on the board for decades. Barington’s call for separating the company comes just days after apparel maker Gap Inc announced it would spin off its better-performing Old Navy brand. L Brands’ shares have fallen nearly 40 percent in the last 12 months. By comparison, the S&P composite 1500 apparel retail index had risen about 13 percent in the same period."

The company’s shares fell 6 percent in extended trading and were set to add to their 43 percent drop this year, as its Victoria’s Secret and Pink brands face stiff competition to connect with shoppers opting for cheaper bralettes and sports bras. Sales at Victoria’s Secret, L Brands’ biggest division by revenue, have fallen in seven out of the last eight quarters, mainly due to weakness in Pink, the brand launched in 2002 aimed at college-going clientele. “In Pink, fashion errors in loungewear have driven a recent deceleration in performance,” the company said. L Brands said on Monday it hired John Mehas from lifestyle brand Tory Burch as CEO of Victoria’s Secret to replace Jan Singer, effective early 2019. Mehas is a retail industry and merchandising veteran who has previous stints at Polo Ralph Lauren's Club Monaco, Gap GPS.N and Macy's M.N Bloomingdales. “For us, it means management sees no turnaround in the immediate future, which most investors probably would have guessed, but it still hurts to see it in a dividend cut by half,” Wedbush analyst Jen Redding said. Monday’s appointment comes a few months after the company named a new head for its Pink brand. “Our new leaders are coming in with a fresh perspective and looking at everything ... our marketing, brand positioning, internal talent, real estate portfolio and cost structure,” Chief Executive Officer Leslie Wexner said in a statement. L Brands has said it would pursue options for its money-losing La Senza brand and shut down Henri Bendel retail stores and website, as it focuses on its core brands.

L Brands has been trying to reset the Victoria's Secret brand and its Pink lingerie business to stem declining sales due to intense competition from American Eagle Outfitter's AEO.N Aerie and upstarts such as Adore Me and Third Love. The company’s brash marketing and dark store environments have also proved to be out of step with what modern customers want, analysts have said. “La Senza news is good, but LB is still overstored with rising competition, which yields continued margin erosion,” Jefferies analyst Randal Konik wrote in a note. “This company has bigger problems that need addressing.” L Brands, which bought Canadian chain La Senza for about $700 million in early 2007, said it estimates that the brand will post an operating loss of $40 million and sales of about $250 million for the year. Bernstein’s Jamie Merriman also welcomed the La Senza decision, saying that she does not see the brand becoming a positive contributor to operating profit. The announcement comes as L Brands said last month it would shut down operations at another non-core business - luxury fashion accessories retailer Henri Bendel. “(The La Senza move) along with the decision to close Henri Bendel, is a signal that management is focused on improving profit and taking the steps necessary to transform the business,” Merriman said.
