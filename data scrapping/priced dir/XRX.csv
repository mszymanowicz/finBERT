1.724959794725697," Former Xerox executive urges 2nd Circuit to reject 'dangerous' SEC gag rule A lawyer for former Xerox executive Barry Romeril urged the 2nd U.S. Court of Appeals on Friday to lift what she called a “gag order” included in Romeril’s settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, arguing the provision was unconstitutional. Margaret Little of the New Civil Liberties Alliance told a three-judge panel that the SEC policy of letting defendants settle without admitting the agency’s allegations -- but only if they agree to not deny them or face having the case reopened -- violates Romeril’s First Amendment rights and the rights of the 98% of defendants who settle SEC civil cases.

Lebanon entered the year suffering from political, banking, financial and economic crises. Its Covid-19 lockdown has exacerbated the situation. The Lebanese pound’s unofficial rate has recently been around 4,000 to the dollar, up from roughly 2,600 in early March, Reuters reported. So inflation is expected to skyrocket, even with the economy likely to shrink by 12%, according to the International Monetary Fund. No wonder that violent protests – resulting in at least one death – have broken out again. Much of the ire is focused on banks. Lebanon’s problems are unique. But a version of its extreme economic hardship will be felt across the globe as the second quarter’s historic contraction pummels economies. Developed markets can soothe some of the pain with stimulus, though are already facing pushback. The limited fiscal capacity of less developed countries could yield more unrest. Lebanon’s protests are unlikely to be the last. (By Anna Szymanski) NO GOOD DEED GOES UNPUNISHED. 3M is selling more respirators and masks to help contain Covid-19, but it’s still hurting from drops in transportation and consumer goods. The $90 billion company reported $8.1 billion in net sales and adjusted earnings of $1.3 billion, beating analysts’ estimates, according to Refinitiv. While the company’s like-for-like sales grew just 0.3%, respirators contributed a whole percentage point, worth $100 million. They’re expected to contribute even more in the second quarter, the company said on Tuesday. That’s not enough to offset falling sales of other things 3M makes, ranging from Post-it notes to auto parts. And even though the company is providing an essential product for front-line medical workers, it has not raised prices. 3M is facing just as much uncertainty as other companies: it withdrew its full-year forecast, suspended its share repurchase program and cut costs. 3M may make one of the most in-demand goods on the planet, but being a conglomerate means taking the rough with the smooth. (By Amanda Gomez) PRINTER BID ENDS WITH A RASPBERRY. Xerox’s bold – and failed – hostile takeover attempt on $21 billion rival HP has left scars of the emotional and accounting kind. After a bruising battle that ended in March as both businesses turned their focus to the Covid-19 pandemic, Xerox on Tuesday reported its first quarterly loss in 10 years, tipped ever so slightly into the red by $17 million paid to lawyers and other deal advisers. That pales next to the other impacts of the disease on Xerox’s business. Clearly, demand for copiers and printers isn’t what it was. But the company also had to take a $74 million bad-debt charge in the quarter in anticipation of customers failing to pay what’s due – more than it has set aside in any full year since 2013. Xerox has plenty on its plate. It’s a good thing it’s not also pursuing the acrimonious acquisition of a company now six times its value. (By John Foley) NOTABLE BY OMISSION. European Commission Executive Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis on Tuesday unveiled some “quick fixes” to encourage banks to lend to virus-hit firms and households. They needn’t set aside a shedload of capital when they grant borrowers a pandemic payment holiday, he said. Nor do they have to treat state-guaranteed credit as punitively as normal credit when provisioning for non-performing loans. Yet he failed to allow sovereign debt to be excluded from the most basic calculation of balance-sheet strength, the leverage ratio. The Federal Reserve has given U.S. banks that concession until March 2021, effectively encouraging them to load up on Treasuries. Europe’s restraint is laudable. European supervisors already allowed banks to breach their leverage ratios, so extra help would be overkill. Given Italian and Spanish bonds are riskier than U.S. Treasuries, which are the benchmark for the world, it’s appropriate that banks have to account for that. (By Liam Proud) EXCESS FOR EXOR. Of all the companies going into the Great Lockdown, the Agnelli family’s investment vehicle should have been one of the least to worry about having enough cash. Exor in early March agreed to sell PartnerRe for $9 billion to French insurer Covea. And the pending merger of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles with Peugeot promised 5.5 billion euros of dividends to shareholders, of which Exor is the largest. So Exor’s 500 million euro sale of 10-year bonds this week raised a few eyebrows. But as with all best-laid plans, life gets in the way. Though Covea has signed on the dotted line, there are still a few formalities to be ironed out before the money arrives. And while the FCA-Peugeot deal makes even more industrial sense post-pandemic, the car industry’s ructions will put big dividends off for some time. Grabbing some cash now makes sense – and to pay just 2.25% is arguably a show of strength. (By Rob Cox) SELF-RELIANCE. Mukesh Ambani isn’t letting a pandemic mess with plans for $120 billion Reliance Industries. Having just welcomed a $6 billion investment from Facebook into its digital business, the retail-to-oil conglomerate is mulling a rights issue of unspecified size. Any deal will come from a position of strength. Reliance shares have outperformed the benchmark Nifty 50 index by 30 percentage points since India went into lockdown. And an issuance would be a huge vote of confidence in the company from Ambani himself – the tycoon and related entities own about half the stock. The announcement suggests a deal with Saudi Aramco is on hold: the oil giant last year sketched out plans to pay $15 billion for 20% of the Indian group’s oil-to-chemicals division. That deal was the foundation for Ambani’s pre-Covid-19 promise to slash net debt to zero by March 2021. The rights issue will stop Ambani from going too far off track. (By Una Galani) EMPTY TROLLEYS. Marks and Spencer has missed out on the Covid-19 grocery binge. The British supermarket chain that specialises in freshly made sandwiches and pricey ready meals said on Tuesday that its food business was “adversely affected” by the lockdown. Unlike peers J Sainsbury and Tesco, which have enjoyed record sales, M&S was let down by its city-centre stores and cafés. The beleaguered clothes business is a bigger concern. Chief Executive Steve Rowe is stress-testing the business for “materially subdued trading” for the rest of 2020. It’s little wonder that the company’s shares are down 57% since the beginning of the year, whereas those of Tesco are only down 9%. The only bright spot in Tuesday’s statement is that the group’s banks are being lenient. They have provided an extra 1.1 billion pounds through a revolving credit facility and relaxed or removed debt covenants until September 2021. That gives Rowe a little time to find a long-term fix for the struggling retailer. (By Aimee Donnellan) CLEAR AS MUD. Wirecard’s Chief Executive Markus Braun, also the German payments group’s biggest shareholder with 7%, presumably hoped to reassure his fellow investors on Tuesday morning. The company said that an investigation by auditors KPMG had found no evidence of “balance sheet forgery”, and that none of the four main areas of the report had turned up a reason to adjust its financial accounts between 2016 and 2018. It’s unlikely to put the matter to bed. KPMG’s findings, published in German, are heavily caveated and cite a lack of willingness to cooperate on the part of Wirecard’s third-party partners. Those businesses were central to allegations of suspect accounting made by the Financial Times, which Wirecard has always denied. Investors were hoping for a full rebuttal of the claims. A 15% share-price fall after the report’s release suggests they’re understandably disappointed. (By Liam Proud)"
-42.31322587649633," Xerox drawn into duplicative Japanese fight MELBOURNE (Reuters Breakingviews) - A company synonymous with copying should expect some duplication. Xerox has become aggressive since pushy investor Carl Icahn arrived on the scene. After rancorously blowing up a deal and ending a 57-year joint venture with Japan’s Fujifilm, the U.S. printer maker initiated a hostile $35 billion bid for rival HP. Now a longtime partner of HP’s is threatening to break ties if the takeover is successful. HP has been resisting the advances of its smaller competitor. Rushing to Chairman Chip Bergh’s side is the boss of one of the company’s largest suppliers of laser-printer components: Canon. It was Icahn, and the Xerox boss he installed, John Visentin, who helped torpedo a $6.1 billion sale to Fujifilm two years ago. The transaction was controversial, but things got nasty. When Fujifilm sued Xerox for abandoning the merger, Visentin responded with an ornery letter to his counterpart, Shigetaka Komori, calling it a “desperate, misguided negotiating ploy.” The two companies eventually unwound a decades-long alliance, with Fujifilm buying Xerox’s 25% stake last November for $2.3 billion. As HP rejected Xerox’s tender offer last week, Canon CEO Fujio Mitarai told Nikkei he is prepared to tear up his company’s storied association with HP if Xerox becomes the new owner. That’s a remarkable declaration considering that in 2018 HP accounted for nearly 14% of Canon’s $38 billion of revenue, which has been falling. The company’s shareholders weren’t obviously spooked, but the provocation is nevertheless telling. The HP-Canon bond is the stuff of business lore. An account in the 2008 management book “The Power of Two” says the unwritten rule at HP was that “if you screw up the relationship with Canon, you will get fired.” Eight years later, when HP bought Samsung Electronics’ printer business, comments from Mitarai were included in the press release, signalling the importance of HP’s now 35-year link with Canon. Maybe threatening to throw all that away is just a tactic to preserve an arrangement that’s advantageous to Canon. It could also, however, reflect a distaste for the kind of distracting, public spat that Xerox had with Fujifilm. Whether Xerox likes it or not – and whether there is a cheaper vendor to be found – strong relationships matter in corporate Japan and beyond. It should be little surprise that hard-nosed tactics invite copycat responses. Corrects Canon chief executive’s name to Mitarai throughout and HP job title to chairman in second paragraph."
-6.080863076814704," Xerox prepares to take HP buyout bid hostile (Reuters) - Xerox Corp said on Tuesday it was planning to take its $33.5 billion buyout bid directly to HP Inc shareholders after the personal computer maker refused to open its books for due diligence before a deadline. “We plan to engage directly with HP shareholders to solicit their support in urging the HP Board to do the right thing and pursue this compelling opportunity,” Xerox said in a letter to HP’s board. HP did not immediately respond to a request for comment. HP on Sunday rejected Xerox’s $22 per share offer that consists of $17 in cash and 0.137 Xerox share for each HP share, saying the offer “significantly undervalues HP”. The computer maker also accused Xerox of using aggressive words and actions to force a potential combination on opportunistic terms and without providing adequate information. “While you may not appreciate our ‘aggressive’ tactics, we will not apologize for them,” Xerox said on Tuesday. Last week, Xerox threatened to take its bid hostile, if HP did not agree to a “friendly” discussion and open its books before Monday. Xerox made the offer for HP, a company more than three times its size, on Nov. 5, after it resolved a dispute with its joint venture partner Fujifilm Holdings Corp that represented billions of dollars in potential liabilities. HP has also said that under Xerox’s proposed terms, the combined company would be saddled with “outsized debt”. However, HP left the door open for a deal that would involve it becoming the acquirer and said it can evaluate the merits by a due diligence of Xerox."

The personal computer maker said last Sunday it rebuffed Xerox’s offer, and that it was open to exploring its own bid for the U.S. printer maker. Xerox had offered HP shareholders $22 per share, involving $17 in cash and 0.137 Xerox share for each HP share, according to a Nov. 5 letter. “We reiterate that we reject Xerox’s proposal as it significantly undervalues HP,” HP said in a letter to Xerox made public on Sunday. “There continues to be uncertainty regarding Xerox’s ability to raise the cash portion of the proposed consideration and concerns regarding the prudence of the resulting outsized debt burden on the value of the combined company’s stock even if the financing were obtained,” the letter added. HP also said it was concerned that Xerox’s exit from Fujifilm’s joint venture earlier this month left a “sizeable strategic hole in Xerox’s portfolio”.

HP on Sunday rejected Xerox’s offer of $22 per share, saying it undervalued the company, and that it was open to exploring its own bid for the U.S. printer maker. “We are confused by this reasoning in that your own financial adviser, Goldman Sachs & Co, set a $14 price target with a ‘sell’ rating for HP’s stock after you announced your restructuring plan,” Xerox wrote in its letter to HP. The median price target on HP stock by 15 analysts is $20. HP did not respond to Reuters’ request for comment. “Unless you and we agree on mutual confirmatory due diligence to support a friendly combination by Nov. 25, Xerox will take its compelling case to create superior value for our respective shareholders directly to your shareholders,” the company said in the letter. HP said on Sunday that, under Xerox’s proposed terms, the combined company would be saddled with “outsized debt”. However, HP left the door open for a deal that would involve it becoming the acquirer of Xerox, and said it can evaluate the merits by accessing diligence information on Xerox. Xerox on Thursday said it has accepted HP’s request for due diligence, but that HP had refused to open its books to Xerox. “Any friendly process for a combination of this type requires mutual diligence - your proposal for one-way diligence is an unnecessary delay tactic,” Xerox wrote. Many analysts have said there is merit in the companies combining to better cope with a stagnating printing market, but some cited challenges to integration, given their different offerings and pricing models. “Xerox’s move could force HP to propose a higher acquisition price that would benefit HP shareholders, or potentially turn the tables and have HP look to acquire Xerox,” Morningstar analyst Mark Cash said. Activist investor Carl Icahn, who took over Xerox’s board last year with fellow businessman Darwin Deason, told the Wall Street Journal last week that he was not set on a particular structure for a deal with HP, as long as a combination is achieved. Icahn has a 4% stake in HP.

Xerox made the offer for HP, a company more than three times its size, on Nov. 5, after it resolved a dispute with its joint venture partner Fujifilm Holdings Corp that represented billions of dollars in potential liabilities. Responding to Xerox’s offer on Sunday, HP said in a statement that it would saddle the combined company with “outsized debt” and was not in the best interest of its shareholders. However, HP left the door open for a deal that would involve it becoming the acquirer of Xerox, stating that it recognized the potential benefits of consolidation. “With substantive engagement from Xerox management and access to diligence information on Xerox, we believe that we can quickly evaluate the merits of a potential transaction,” HP said in its statement. The move puts pressure on Xerox to open its books to HP. Xerox did not immediately respond on Sunday to a request for comment on whether it will engage with HP in negotiations as the potential acquisition target, rather than the acquirer. HP on Sunday published Xerox CEO John Visentin’s Nov. 5 offer letter to HP, in which he stated that his company was “prepared to devote all necessary resources to finalize our due diligence on an accelerated basis.” Activist investor Carl Icahn, who took over Xerox’s board last year together with fellow billionaire businessman Darwin Deason, said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal last week that he was not set on a particular structure for a deal with HP, as long as a combination is achieved. Icahn has also amassed a 4% stake in HP. Xerox had offered HP shareholders $22 per share that included $17 in cash and 0.137 Xerox shares for each HP share, according to the Nov. 5 letter. The offer would have resulted in HP shareholders owning about 48% of the combined company. HP shares ended trading on Friday at $20.18. Many analysts have said there is merit in the companies combining to better cope with a stagnating printing market, but some cited challenges to integration, given their different offerings and pricing models. Xerox scrapped its $6.1 billion deal to merge with Fujifilm last year under pressure from Icahn and Deason. Xerox announced earlier this month it would sell its 25% stake in the joint venture for $2.3 billion. Fujifilm also agreed to drop a lawsuit against Xerox, which it was pursuing following their failed merger. The negotiations with Xerox represent a major test for HP’s new CEO, Enrique Lores, the former president of HP’s imaging and printing business, who officially took over earlier this month. HP is mindful of large acquisitions given its fateful deal for British software company Autonomy almost a decade ago. HP bought Autonomy for $11.1 billion in 2011 as the centerpiece of its unsuccessful pivot to software. Little over a year later, it wrote off $8.8 billion, $5 billion of which it put down to accounting improprieties, misrepresentation and disclosure failures. More recently, HP has been struggling with its printer business segment recently, with the division’s third-quarter revenue dropping 5% on-year. It has announced a cost-saving program worth more than $1 billion that could result in its shedding about 16% of its workforce, or about 9,000 employees, over the next few years. Xerox’s stock has rallied under Visentin, who took over last year as CEO. However, HP said on Sunday that a decline in Xerox’s revenue since June 2018 from $10.2 billion to $9.2 “raises significant questions” regarding the trajectory of Xerox’s business and future prospects."

Icahn, who owns a 10.6% stake in Xerox, disclosed a stake of 62.9 million shares of HP valued at $1.19 billion as of Sept. 30, in an SEC filing on Thursday. An HP spokesperson told Reuters the company is aware of Icahn’s investment and is committed to doing what is in the best interests of all HP shareholders. Xerox made a roughly $33 billion cash-and-stock offer for HP, a company more than three times Xerox’s size, Reuters reported last week. HP confirmed the bid, but has not disclosed the offer price. “I think a combination is a no-brainer,” Icahn was quoted as saying by the Journal. “I believe very strongly in the synergies,” he said, adding that “there will probably be a choice between cash and stock and I would much rather have the stock, assuming there’s a good management team.” Xerox believes it can achieve at least $2 billion in annual cost synergies by creating an office technology supplies giant, a source told Reuters last week. The billionaire told the Journal that his team began looking at HP in late February and he bought the company’s shares from late April to mid August, though he did not have a deal with Xerox in mind when he started accumulating the shares. Icahn said he believes a combined company is in the best interests of both sets of shareholders given the potential for cost savings and to market a more balanced portfolio of printer offerings, the WSJ reported. This is not the first deal that Icahn has tried to orchestrate by having a small company buy a bigger one. In June, U.S. casino operator Eldorado Resorts Inc agreed to acquire larger peer Caesars Entertainment Corp for $17.3 billion, including debt. Icahn had earlier gained seats on the board of Caesars.

4.951226393167346," Xerox cuts full-year revenue forecast, shares fall (Reuters) - Xerox Corp XRX.N posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday, but cut its full-year revenue forecast citing organizational changes, primarily in North America. Shares of the U.S. photocopier maker were down 3.5% at $32.72 in trading around noon. Xerox scrapped a complex deal last year to merge with Japan's Fujifilm Holdings Corp 4901.T after it ran into strong opposition from activist investors Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason. Since then, the company has taken initiatives to streamline its business under the new management led by Chief Executive Officer John Visentin, an Icahn appointee. Xerox now expects 2019 revenue to fall 6%, compared with a 5% decline it had estimated earlier. Total revenue for the second quarter fell nearly 9% to $2.29 billion, as businesses continue to cut spending on printers and photocopiers. Analysts had expected revenue of $2.32 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. “Results were due to weaker economic conditions in Western Europe and certain developing markets and continued operational impacts in the United States we identified last quarter, albeit improving as the quarter went on,” Visentin said on a post earnings call with analysts. Net income attributable to Xerox rose to $181 million, or 77 cents per share, in the three months ended June 30, from $112 million, or 42 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned 99 cents per share, above estimates of 88 cents."

1.9456805743774594," EU drafting retaliatory tariff list hitting Caterpillar, Xerox, Samsonite: Bloomberg WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The European Union has drafted a list of retaliatory tariffs that would target Caterpillar Inc, Xerox Corp and Samsonite International if U.S. President Donald Trump imposes duties on European cars, Bloomberg News reported on Friday, citing an unnamed senior EU official. Trump, who is known to have a strong protectionist bent on trade, has said the United States will impose tariffs on European car imports if it is unable to reach a trade deal with the European Union. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said in July that Trump promised he would hold off for the time being while the two sides sought to improve trade relations, such as with a deal to cut tariffs on “non-auto industrial goods”. A confidential report by the U.S. Commerce Department sent to Trump last weekend was expected to pave the way for the U.S. president to impose duties of up to 25 percent on imported autos and auto parts by designating them as a threat to U.S. national security. The European Commission, which coordinates trade policy for the 28-member EU, has said it is preparing a list of U.S. products to target with tariffs should Trump decide EU car imports need to be restricted. The Commission told national ministers at a meeting about trade in Bucharest that its list was ready, EU diplomats said, although it did not disclose what was in it. It would go after 20 billion euros ($22.7 billion) worth of U.S. imports, although the list would take the form of categories of products, rather than specific companies. EU car and car parts exports to the United States are worth around 50 billion euros per year, with the bulk of them coming from Germany. The EU has already imposed its own import tariffs on 2.8 billion euros worth of U.S. products ranging from bourbon to motor-bikes as a response to U.S. punitive duties on EU steel and aluminium imports, which had been worth 6.4 billion euros. “Should there be tariffs on cars and car parts, we don’t know, but if it happens we have started internally to prepare a list of rebalancing measures,” EU Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrom told a news conference in Bucharest. “There is full support to do this. Of course if it happens we would immediately publish that list for formal consultation,” she continuing, adding that U.S. car tariffs would also lead to the end of planned trade negotiations with Washington. Xerox, Caterpillar and Samsonite did not immediately respond to requests for comment. ($1 = 0.8819 euros)"

22.985057301581072," Xerox profit, forecast beat estimates; shares jump (Reuters) - Xerox Corp beat analysts’ expectations for profit in the fourth quarter and forecast full-year profit above estimates, suggesting moves to refocus under new management were paying off and sending its shares up 6 percent. The company is streamlining its business and scaling up operations under a new regime installed by activist investors Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason last year. Xerox had agreed to merge with its long-standing joint-venture with Japan’s Fujifilm Holdings Corp as it struggled to deal with a long-running decline in demand for printing and photocopying equipment. That deal was scrapped under pressure from Icahn and Deason, and control was handed over to new management under Chief Executive Officer John Visentin, an Icahn aide. “We remain focused on removing complexity in the way we work, organizing more effectively ... and we are seeing those efforts reflected in this quarter’s results,” Visentin said. “We are well positioned as we enter 2019.” The Norwalk, Connecticut-based company said it expected to report 2019 profit of between $3.70 and $3.80 per share on an adjusted basis, well above analysts’ average expectation of $3.53, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Some analysts, however, pointed to a shortfall in Xerox’s fourth-quarter revenue, which was $2.53 billion compared to consensus forecasts of $2.56 billion, asking whether cost-cutting alone can deliver its promised profits. “The biggest question is how they will be able to mitigate revenue declines because the ability to reduce costs is finite and then to continue to grow EPS, they need to actually grow revenue,” Cross Research analyst Shannon Cross said. Net income attributable to Xerox was $137 million, or 56 cents per share, compared to a loss of $190 million, or 76 cents per share, a year earlier. Excluding items, the company earned $1.14 per share, beating estimates of $1.04, helped by a 5 percent drop in total costs."

-10.419258317317096," Xerox beats on profit, misses on revenue under Icahn appointees (Reuters) - Xerox Corp fell short on revenue but beat estimates for profit on the back of cost-cutting in its first full quarter under new management backed by activist investors Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason. The U.S. photocopier, which is facing a long-running decline in its core business, reported net profit that roughly halved and said revenue fell 5.8 percent year-on-year to $2.35 billion in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, below an average analyst estimate of $2.42 billion. Operating cash flow for the quarter, however, rose and the company increased its 2018 share repurchase target to $700 million from $500 million and forecast for full-year free cash flow to between $900 million and $1 billion. “Clearly, our priority to drive revenue requires the most effort,” Chief Executive Officer John Visentin, who worked as a consultant to Icahn in the proxy fight, said on a call with analysts. “We are putting in place actions to sustainably improve our revenue performance. These start with building a more simplified, agile organizational structures and include further expanding our channel presence...”, he said. Xerox has struggled with falling demand for office printing equipment as the popularity of smartphones reduced the need to print, and the company agreed in January to a $6.1 billion merger with Fuji Xerox, its 56-year-old joint venture with Fujifilm. But the complex deal ran into strong opposition from Icahn and Deason and in May the photocopier pioneer scrapped the merger and handed management control to the activist investors. Shares of the Norwalk, Connecticut-based company that have fallen about 9 percent this year so far, rose marginally in early trading on Tuesday. Fujifilm, which was to take a majority stake in the combined company as part of the deal, has sued Xerox, winning an appeal last week giving the Japanese company leverage to bring Xerox management back to the negotiating table. “We don’t believe (the appeals court’s ruling) means very much for Xerox, because Xerox terminated that transaction for reasons unrelated to the injunctions,” said Visentin. Net income attributable to Xerox fell to $89 million, or 34 cents per share, in the third-quarter ended Sept. 30, from $179 million, or 68 cents per share, a year earlier, hurt by higher taxes.

-12.425308991624842," Fujifilm wins appeal in battle with Xerox over aborted merger TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan’s Fujifilm Holdings Corp has won an appeal in its legal battles with Xerox Corp, with a New York court overturning preliminary injunctions requested by an activist investor that had blocked their planned merger. Xerox in May scrapped a $6.1 billion deal with Fujifilm in a settlement with investors Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason that also handed control of the U.S. photocopier giant to new management. The ruling by the New York State Appellate Court could give the Japanese firm leverage to bring Xerox management back to the negotiating table. Fujifilm is also suing Xerox in a separate U.S. suit that seeks well over $1 billion, accusing it of breach of contract in abandoning the deal. Its chances of success are, however, unclear as Xerox’s new management, backed by Icahn and Deason, is opposed to the proposed merger. Analysts have said the only way for Fujifilm to gain any traction with Xerox now is to raise its offer. Fujifilm said in a statement it stands by its view that the original planned merger remains the best option for the shareholders of both companies. “(The) Court’s decision will allow us to discuss with Xerox the fulfillment of the original agreement. All Xerox shareholders ought to be able to decide for themselves the operational, financial, and strategic merits of the transaction to combine Fuji Xerox and Xerox,” it said. The two companies agreed in January to a complex deal that would have merged Xerox into their Asia joint venture Fuji Xerox and given Fujifilm control. That prompted Icahn and Deason, who own 15 percent of Xerox and argued the U.S. firm was being undervalued, to launch a proxy fight. Representatives for Xerox, Deason and Icahn were not immediately available for comment. The New York court found in its Oct. 16 ruling that Xerox’s former CEO Jeff Jacobson, accused by Deason of negotiating the deal to save his own job, had neither misled or misinformed the board. “The board, which engaged outside advisors and discussed the proposed transaction on numerous occasions prior to voting on agreeing to present it to the shareholders, did not engage in a mere post hoc review, nor was the transaction unreasonable on its face,” the ruling also said. The bitter legal wrangling has created much uncertainty for the two firms which are seen by many analysts as inextricably intertwined through their Fuji Xerox joint venture. The venture accounts for nearly half of Fujifilm’s revenue while Xerox no longer builds its own office copiers, instead relying mostly on Fuji Xerox. Xerox has said it would start sourcing products from new vendors for sale directly to customers in Fuji Xerox’s primary Asia-Pacific market. The U.S. firm is now led by John Visentin who worked as a consultant to Icahn in the proxy fight and just this month it appointed Louie Pastor, previously deputy general counsel at Icahn Enterprises, as general counsel. Fujifilm Chief Executive Shigetaka Komori said in June the company was “not opposed to considering any new proposal from the new Xerox board” but added many of its shareholders were demanding that its money would be better off spent on its healthcare businesses. “The latest ruling is a step forward for Fujifilm to make the deal happen,” said Masayuki Otani, chief market analyst at Securities Japan who believes Fujifilm should focus on healthcare. “But concerns remain about whether taking over Xerox is the right step for the company.” Fujifilm’s shares were up 1.3 percent in afternoon trade, in line with the broader market."

Xerox, which has been exploring options including a sale of the company, was sued by Fujifilm for over $1 billion, seeking punitive damages and a $183 million merger termination fee. The merger was announced in January and abandoned on May 13 when Xerox, in a settlement with shareholders Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason, agreed to install new directors and replace the chief executive officer with Icahn-backed John Visentin. Xerox also threatened to end its technology agreement with the 56-year-old joint venture Fuji Xerox, and said it would start sourcing products from new vendors to lower its dependency on Fujifilm.

Divesting the leasing unit would relieve Xerox of roughly $3.6 billion in debt, one of the sources said. Activist investors Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason, who took control of Xerox earlier this year, are preparing to launch an auction for the company, which has a market capitalization of $6.4 billion and total debt as of the end of March of $5.5 billion. Xerox has not made a final decision on selling the leasing finance unit, the sources said this week, asking not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Xerox declined to comment, while representatives for Icahn and Deason did not respond to requests for comment. Reuters reported in May that buyout firm Apollo Global Management approached the company to express its acquisition interest. Reducing Xerox’s liabilities through the sale of the leasing finance unit would allow private equity firms to place more debt on the company to juice returns. Xerox has said it is exploring its strategic options after it ended its deal with Fujifilm, following pressure from Icahn, a billionaire investor, and Deason, a former executive at a company that Xerox acquired several years ago. The two together own 15 percent of Xerox shares. The company has been engaged in a legal fight with Fujifilm since their merger agreement ended in May. Fujifilm sued Xerox in June for more than $1 billion, accusing it of breaching its merger contract and engaging in “intentional and egregious conduct.” Xerox has disputed these claims. The head of Fuji Xerox Co Ltd, a 56-year-old joint venture between Fujifilm and Xerox, said this week he was confident that the escalating dispute between the partners would not lead to the venture’s dissolution. Fujifilm owns 75 percent of the joint venture and Xerox the remainder. Xerox said last month it would start sourcing products from new vendors to lower its dependence on Fujifilm, and cautioned it may not renew a technology agreement with Fuji Xerox. Fujifilm responded by threatening to compete against Xerox in Asia-Pacific and challenge it in America and Europe if it failed to renew the technology agreement in 2021."

Photocopier maker Fuji Xerox, 75 percent owned by Japan’s Fujifilm and the rest by U.S. copier firm Xerox, is central to a months-long battle between the partners over a $6.1 billion merger combining Xerox with the 56-year-old venture.

The U.S. firm, which relies on Fuji Xerox for most of its office copiers, also said it would start sourcing products from new vendors for sale directly to customers in Fuji Xerox’s primary Asia-Pacific market. For Fuji Xerox, a breakup with Xerox could result in the loss of over $1 billion in revenue. But Tamai said turning to other vendors would be disadvantageous for Xerox. “That would increase costs for Xerox,” he said. “It is my responsibility to convince Xerox that it is cheaper and more reasonable to source products from us.” “My mission is to persuade Xerox executives that the merger would be the best solution for both companies,” he said. “Daily interactions with them actually have given me a feeling that many at Xerox actually support the merger.”"

Fujifilm sued Xerox last week for well over $1 billion, faulting the printer and copier company for succumbing to pressure from activist investors Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason in calling off a proposed merger agreed in January. In a letter to Fujifilm Chief Executive Officer Shigetaka Komori, Xerox’s newly appointed CEO, John Visentin, cited “massive and ongoing accounting fraud at Fuji Xerox” and “numerous contractual breaches” as grounds to not renew the joint venture when it expires in 2021. “Simply put, Fujifilm has failed to prepare Fuji Xerox to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to U.S. public companies, and, as you and your advisors are surely aware, it would likely take years for any such compliance capability to be achieved,” Visentin said in the letter. In response, Fujifilm said Xerox’s argument on Fuji Xerox’s accounting issue is wrong. “The accounting issue at Fuji Xerox is properly resolved and no longer exists.” Fuji Xerox, 75 percent owned by Japan’s Fujifilm and rest by Xerox, handles contracts that supply global clients with Xerox services in the United States and Europe, as well as Fuji Xerox services in Asia. Moreover, Xerox no longer builds its own office copiers, instead relying mostly on Fuji Xerox. “Fujifilm’s actions have forced us to move forward on several fronts to protect our supply chain,” Visentin said. Xerox named Steven Bandrowczak as its chief operating officer as it looks to build its own supply chain in the fast-growing Asia-Pacific market. “We do think that Xerox has the ability to build its supply chains and source products from scratch in Asia, although the merger with Fuji would have been the ideal situation,” an institutional investor, who holds 5 million shares in Xerox, told Reuters. A Xerox spokesman did not disclose any details on its sourcing strategy.

Fujifilm sued Xerox last week for well over $1 billion, faulting the printer and copier company for succumbing to pressure from activist investors Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason in calling off a proposed merger agreed in January. “Fujifilm’s actions have forced us to move forward on several fronts to protect our supply chain,” Xerox said in a statement.

3.9234656800889467," Fujifilm sues Xerox for well over $1 billion after aborted merger NEW YORK (Reuters) - Fujifilm Holdings Corp sued Xerox Corp on Monday for well over $1 billion, faulting the printer and copier company for succumbing to pressure from activist investors Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason in calling off a proposed merger. In a complaint filed with the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, Fujifilm accused Xerox of breach of contract and engaging in “intentional and egregious conduct” in abandoning the $6.1 billion merger announced in January. Icahn, the billionaire, and Deason together owned 15 percent of Xerox shares, and said the merger undervalued the Norwalk, Connecticut-based company. “It is inconsistent with shareholder democracy to allow Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason, minority shareholders with only 15 percent of Xerox’s shares, to dictate the fate of Xerox,” Fujifilm said in a statement. The merger was scrapped on May 13 when Xerox, in a settlement with Icahn and Deason, agreed to install several new directors and replace Jeff Jacobson as chief executive with technology executive John Visentin. Xerox also cited unresolved accounting issues as a reason to end the merger. In a statement on Monday, Xerox said it remained “extremely confident” it had a contractual right to back out, and would seek remedies for Fujifilm’s “mismanagement and misconduct.” A spokeswoman for Deason had no immediate comment. Icahn did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Xerox has been exploring strategic options, including transactions with other companies, but the lawsuit could force it to address Fujifilm’s grievances sooner. A merger would have combined Xerox with the 56-year-old joint venture Fujifilm Xerox, in which Fujifilm and Xerox had stakes of 75 percent and 25 percent, respectively. Thereafter, Fujifilm would have owned 50.1 percent of Xerox’s common stock, and Xerox shareholders would have received a $2.5 billion special dividend. Fujifilm had hoped the merger would deliver at least $1.7 billion of cost savings and $1 billion of new revenue annually. Its lawsuit also seeks punitive damages and a $183 million merger termination fee. “Xerox has recently been subject to the whims of activist investors Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason, who, notwithstanding their minority ownership of Xerox shares, have yanked the Xerox Board in more directions than can be counted,” Fujifilm said. Fujifilm has appealed an April 27 temporary injunction sought by Deason and granted by a New York state judge to block the merger. Deason, who had accused Jacobson of arranging the merger to keep his job, is still pursuing a lawsuit accusing Fujifilm of aiding and abetting breaches of fiduciary duty by Xerox’s old board. Fujifilm filed counterclaims on June 14. Xerox shares closed down 17 cents, or 0.6 percent, at $27.24 on the New York Stock Exchange. The case is Fujifilm Holdings Corp v Xerox Corp, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 18-05458."

-0.8445257835286024," Fujifilm could walk away from Xerox deal if no progress for six months TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Fujifilm Holdings Corp 4901.T said on Thursday it may have no choice but to abandon a $6.1 billion merger with Xerox Corp XRX.N if there is no progress in talks with the U.S. firm's new board for about half a year. “I don’t have a specific deadline in mind, but it should normally be from several months to six months. If we have nothing by then, it can’t be helped,” Chief Executive Shigetaka Komori said in his first media session since the U.S. photocopier company scrapped their merger deal. A spokeswoman later clarified this meant Fujifilm could end merger talks. Xerox could not be reached for comment. The two companies in January agreed to a complex deal that would merge Xerox into their 56-year-old Asia joint venture Fuji Xerox, which Fujifilm would control with a 50.1 percent stake. But Xerox scrapped the deal last month in a settlement with activist investors Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason, who opposed the takeover by Fujifilm saying it undervalued the U.S. company. Fuji Xerox - 75 percent owned by Fujifilm - can grow on its own, but Xerox depends on Fuji Xerox to produce almost all of the U.S. firm’s copier machines, Komori said. Under the current joint venture agreement, Fuji Xerox is focused on Asia Pacific - the region with the highest growth potential - while Xerox covers the rest. The terms on regional coverage expire in March 2021. Icahn and Deason, who together own about 15 percent of Xerox, had said they would consider an all-cash bid of at least $40 per share. Fujifilm said the previously agreed deal valued Xerox at $8.6 billion, or an 8 percent premium over the average Xerox stock price of $29.7 per share over a month before the deal was announced. But the value would be higher if benefits from an estimated $1.7 billion worth of synergies is included. Komori said Fujifilm is “not opposed to considering any new proposal from the new Xerox board if it’s beneficial for both firms,” but the $40 per share sought by Icahn and Deason is “too high”. The typical premium offered in buyout deals is 30 percent but that would not be possible in this case, Komori said. “We could procure funds, but many shareholders are demanding that money should be used on healthcare businesses,” he said. The photocopier business accounts for nearly half of Fujifilm’s revenue and operating profit. The firm is seeking growth, however, through buying businesses involved in regenerative medicine and pharmaceuticals."

-8.488128919236436," Xerox abandons planned deal with Fujifilm in victory for Icahn and Deason NEW YORK/TOKYO (Reuters) - Xerox Corp XRX.N has scrapped a planned $6.1 billion deal with Fujifilm Holdings Corp 4901.T in a settlement with activist investors Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason that also hands control of the U.S. photocopier giant to new management. The victory for the billionaire investors puts the Japanese company further on the back foot in any new negotiations with Xerox, although it is by no means out of contention as Xerox is now expected to go up for sale in an auction at a higher price. Xerox said that it had over several weeks repeatedly asked Fujifilm to immediately start talks about improved terms for a proposed transaction. “Despite our insistence, Fujifilm provided no assurance that it will do so within an acceptable timeframe,” the U.S. firm said in a statement on its decision to drop the deal. Fujifilm was quick to take a combative stance, saying it disputes Xerox’s right to terminate the deal and would look at all options including legal action seeking damages. The two companies agreed in January to a complex deal that would have merged Xerox into their Asia joint venture Fuji Xerox and given Fujifilm control. That prompted Icahn and Deason, who own 15 percent of Xerox and argued the U.S. firm was being undervalued, to launch a proxy fight. The activist investors have also said they are unhappy with the current structure of the joint venture, and settlement creates uncertainty concerning potential changes to a business that accounts for nearly half of Fujifilm’s revenue. Icahn and Deason have said they believe other investors are ""waiting in the wings"" for Xerox while people familiar with the matter have previously said that buyout firm Apollo Global Management LLC APO.N has expressed interest in a bid for Xerox. But analysts believe the two firms are inextricably intertwined and that Fujifilm is not without bargaining power, while also doubting that talk of other buyers is that substantial. “It wouldn’t be good if it goes elsewhere. But are there really other potential buyers? Icahn and Deason say there are, because they want a higher price, but you don’t really know whether that’s for real,” said Ichiyoshi Asset Management senior executive officer Mitsushige Akino. Fuji Xerox, 75 percent owned by Fujifilm, handles contracts that supply global clients with Xerox services in the United States and Europe, and Fuji Xerox services in Asia. Moreover, Xerox no longer builds its own office copiers, instead relying mostly on Fuji Xerox. Xerox said its new board would meet immediately and “begin a process to evaluate all strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value.” Icahn and Deason have said they would consider an all-cash bid of at least $40 per share. In contrast to the investors’ argument that Fujifilm is only offering $28 per share, analysts have said the Japanese firm’s offer is not too far off that per share valuation, albeit not in cash. The settlement will see Chief Executive Officer Jeff Jacobson - the main architect of the deal with Fujifilm - as well as five other directors step down. John Visentin is expected to take the helm. Visentin had previously been hired by Icahn to assist in fighting Xerox. He had also been a candidate under consideration by the old board to replace Jacobson as recently as last year, according to court documents. It is Xerox’s second settlement with the activist investors in just two weeks. The first settlement agreement was allowed to expire as Xerox came to believe it had flexibility to renegotiate a deal with Fujifilm and also took into account a stock dive that followed the agreement. “We are extremely pleased that Xerox finally terminated the ill-advised scheme to cede control of the company to Fujifilm,” Icahn said in a statement. Xerox also said it was ending the deal partly because Fujifilm had failed to provide audited financial information for Fuji Xerox by an April 15 deadline and that there were “material deviations” between audited Fuji Xerox financial statements and unaudited statements provided previously."

-9.647792673918891," Xerox board seeks better terms from Fujifilm, will resume talks (Reuters) - Xerox Corp’s board said on Wednesday it intended to resume merger discussions with Fujifilm Holdings, seeking a superior deal to terms announced at the end of January that have spurred a proxy fight over the company. Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason, who own 15 percent of Xerox, have been trying to unravel the deal and unlock more value out the company. Asserting the Fujifilm deal values Xerox at just $28 per share, they said this week they would consider an all-cash bid of at least $40 per share. Analysts say the prolonged fight for Xerox could ultimately push higher any offer price from Fujifilm or other interested parties. Buyout firm Apollo Global Management LLC considered a bid for Xerox last week, sources have said. Fujifilm said on Thursday it has not yet received a new proposal from Xerox and believes the current deal provides the best value for the shareholders of both firms. “If we receive a new proposal, we will need to study whether it offers value to the shareholders of Fujifilm,” it said in a statement. The two companies in January agreed to a complex $6.1 billion deal that would merge Xerox into their Asia joint venture Fuji Xerox, which Fujifilm would control with a 50.1 percent stake. Xerox shareholders were also due to receive a $2.5 billion special cash dividend. The firms have not, however, disclosed a per share valuation for Xerox for the deal. UBS analysts estimated in February that the deal valued Xerox at $40 a share - $9.80 in cash for every Xerox share held and calculated the stake in the proposed new Fuji Xerox to be worth $30. That value mostly matches the current demands of the activist shareholders, except they want it all in cash. Shannon Cross from Cross Research said an incremental five dollars plus benefit from synergies from the Fuji-Xerox deal should result over time in a value for Xerox stock that would be above the $40 per share. “At the end of the day, Carl Icahn has always wanted more money for this deal, I am not sure that running the business is what he looks to do,” said Cross. While some Tokyo-based analysts say Fujifilm would be better off putting its money into its non-copier and printer businesses, others argue that the Japanese firm, which relies on the joint venture for nearly half of its revenue, should cede to the activist shareholders’ demands. Xerox had at one stage reopened talks on the deal with Fujifilm but those discussions were suspended after Deason won a temporary court order blocking the deal. The judge said, however, that Xerox was not prohibited from exploring other transactions with Fujifilm. Xerox said on Wednesday that it will pursue an appeal of the lower court’s ruling in the Deason lawsuit, which it believes “was wrongly decided and will be reversed”. Fujifilm is also pursuing an appeal. Shares of Xerox closed 1.6 percent higher at $28.96 on Wednesday. Fujfilm’s shares were flat in Thursday afternoon trade."

-5.519742805274025," Icahn, Deason want bid of at least $40 per share for Xerox (Reuters) - Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason, shareholders in Xerox Corp XRX.N who oppose an agreed deal with Fujifilm Holdings 4901.T, said they would consider an all-cash bid of at least $40 per share - a 43 percent premium to the Japanese firm's offer. In setting a minimum price tag on Xerox, the billionaire investors have thrown the ball back into Fujifilm’s court while also gaining time to woo other investors after Xerox failed on Monday to gain a quick appeal to a temporary court order blocking the deal. While some analysts say Fujifilm would be better off putting its money into its non-copier and printer businesses, others argue that the Japanese firm, which relies its joint venture with Xerox for nearly half of its revenue, should cede to the activist shareholders’ demands. “It’s not cheap, for sure,” said Masahiko Ishino, an analyst at Tokai Tokyo Research Center. “But for Fujifilm, it’s still better than a complete collapse of the deal, which could mess up Xerox in a major way. Fujifilm shouldn’t waste this opportunity.” Icahn and Deason, who together own about 15 percent of Xerox, oppose a complex $6.1 billion deal that would give Fujifilm control of the U.S. copier and printer maker and values it at about $28 per share. The current deal structure calls for Fujifilm to de facto gain control in exchange for a stake in their joint venture - a transaction that would not involve any cash outlay from the Japanese firm. The activist investors are “confident other potential buyers are waiting in the wings” and see the possibility of similar or better value in a standalone Xerox, they said in an open letter to shareholders. The letter also attacked Xerox’s board for going back on an agreement to settle their dispute. Xerox said in a statement that it has “refrained from engaging with Icahn/Deason on their campaign against the company, even as they have targeted our management and Board with personal, unsubstantiated attacks.” The company also said that Icahn’s comments to the Nikkei Tuesday that “a combination of Xerox and Fuji Xerox creates a risk of bankruptcy is false and highly irresponsible.” Apollo Global Management LLC APO.N has approached Xerox to express interest about a possible acquisition, people familiar with the matter have told Reuters. Xerox will now have to wait until September before its appeal can be heard, according to a court filing on Monday. Fujifilm said in a statement it believes it will win its own appeal to the injunction blocking the deal, adding that the current deal valuations were fair. A spokeswoman for the company said it was not in any talks to renegotiate the deal with Xerox but declined to comment further. Fujifilm and Xerox have become heavily reliant on each other through their joint venture Fuji Xerox, and many analysts argue the two businesses are inextricably intertwined. The venture, 75 percent owned by Fujifilm, is focused on Asia, the region with the highest growth potential. But it also handles contracts that supply global clients with Xerox services in the United States and Europe, and Fuji Xerox services in Asia. Moreover, Xerox no longer builds its own office copiers, instead relying mostly on Fuji Xerox, while Fuji Xerox is also seen as needing Xerox’s brand power to boost its presence in China and other parts of Asia. Xerox first agreed to a deal with Fujifilm in late January but then sought better terms at the behest of Icahn and Deason, who gained the court order last month to temporarily block the deal. Granting the order, a New York judge agreed that CEO Jeff Jacobson had been “hopelessly conflicted” in negotiating a deal that would put him in charge, since he knew the board was looking to replace him. In a dramatic turn of events last week, Xerox agreed to fire Jacobson and part of its board to settle the litigation with Icahn and Deason. But it then said the agreement had expired over last-minute issues that arose in negotiations with the judge overseeing the case that made the parties unable to finalize their settlement. Xerox’s shares rose 0.5 percent to $28.61 on Tuesday. Fujifilm’s shares finished 1.5 percent higher on Tuesday."

-7.086107051113015," Xerox appeals decision blocking Fujifilm deal as CEO returns (The May 4 story was corrected to add a dropped part of the quote by Subramanian to show full context of his remark, in the third paragraph) (Reuters) - Xerox Corp XRX.N on Friday appealed a New York court ruling to block its deal with Fujifilm Holdings 4901.T, just hours after the company announced that its ousted CEO and directors would remain in place. Xerox said its entire board and management team would stay, as the agreement to oust them reached with dissenting shareholders Darwin Deason and Carl Icahn expired late Thursday. “With the caveat that I have not been privy to these negotiations, I find the rejection of the settlement by the Xerox board to be extraordinary and highly unusual,” said Guhan Subramanian, a professor at Harvard’s law and business schools who served as an expert witness for Xerox in the litigation. Officially, Xerox and the activists said the agreement had expired over last-minute issues that arose in negotiations with the judge overseeing the case that made the parties unable to finalize their settlement ahead of a self-imposed deadline Thursday evening. A source familiar with the matter said Xerox’s board let the settlement expire because it came to believe it had flexibility to renegotiate a deal with Fujifilm. Xerox’s board also took into account that the company’s shares had fallen more than 10 percent since it announced its settlement with the activists. The judge said in a hearing on May 3 that he was not prohibiting Xerox from exploring other transactions with Fujifilm, according to a court transcript. In fact, Xerox has already started renegotiating its deal with Fujifilm, according to the source, who did not want to be identified because the matter is private. The companies are discussing adding $5 a share to the $2.5 billion special cash dividend of roughly $9.80 per share that Xerox shareholders would receive as part of the deal, the person said. The two companies could also come up with a new structure all together, the person added. Fujifilm declined to comment on the negotiations on Friday, which were first reported by The Wall Street Journal. Xerox shares closed little changed at $28.38 per share on Friday. Xerox and Fujifilm agreed in late January to a $6.1 billion deal that would merge the U.S. printer and copier maker into Fuji Xerox, an existing joint venture between Xerox and Fujifilm. A New York court temporarily blocked the transaction last week, saying that Xerox Chief Executive Officer Jeff Jacobson was “hopelessly conflicted” and that he sought to conclude the deal even though he was advised to end negotiations. In its appeal on Friday, Xerox disputed the court’s findings that the board breached its fiduciary duties in approving the deal and said the board unanimously authorized the deal. Meanwhile, Deason and Icahn, who own about 15 percent of the company, have vowed to keep fighting Xerox, and will nominate a slate of directors at the company’s upcoming annual board meeting. Charles Elson, professor of corporate governance at University of Delaware, said the confusing turn of events at Xerox “give the activists more ammunition” in a proxy fight. Deason and Icahn have argued that Xerox’s board acted in a self-interested fashion and failed shareholders by approving a deal that undervalues the company. Xerox's board has also been exploring its options. Reuters previously reported that buyout firm Apollo Global Management LLC APO.N has approached Xerox to express interest in a possible acquisition. Fujifilm, which had objected to the settlement between Xerox and the activists, said it was satisfied that Xerox had not settled with the activists this week. Fujifilm is also planning to appeal last week’s court order and said in a statement on Friday that Xerox shareholders should decide for themselves the merits of any deal. But a deal under new terms between Fujifilm and Xerox is far from certain. Fujifilm shares have been falling since the deal announcement in late January as investors have been questioning the benefits of the deal."

Xerox said on Tuesday its chief executive officer and most of its board will step down to settle a lawsuit by activist shareholders Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason, paving the way for new management to reconsider the contentious deal with Fujifilm. The company said on Wednesday that it will not provide a forecast for 2018 due to the pending director appointment, nomination and settlement agreement with Icahn and Deason. It would have reaffirmed its full-year guidance on revenue, adjusted operating margin, cash flow and adjusted earnings per share, in the normal course of business, the company said in a statement. Xerox, whose shares closed down 9 percent on Wednesday, also canceled a scheduled post-earnings conference call with analysts. Icahn and Deason, who together hold 15 percent of Xerox, won a rare court order to temporarily block the deal with Fujifilm, which they said undervalued Xerox. Separately, Fujifilm filed on Wednesday an objection with a U.S. Supreme Court judge over Xerox’s settlement with Icahn and Deason, criticizing the way the company handled the process and said it had not followed proper procedure to change control of its board. “The current hurly-burly of private communications with the Court, make-shift submissions and midnight filings is not the proper procedure to decide the fate of a $7 billion publicly traded company,” Fujifilm said in the letter to the court that was seen by Reuters. Fujifilm and Xerox struck a complex deal in January to combine the U.S. company into their existing joint venture, Fuji Xerox, to gain scale and cut costs as demand for office printing equipment declines. Fujifilm was to then take a majority stake in the combined company. But the deal soon ran into opposition. Earlier on Wednesday, Xerox said Keith Cozza, the CEO of Icahn Enterprises, would become its chairman. John Visentin, who formerly led Novitex Enterprise Solutions and had previously been hired by Icahn to assist him in fighting Xerox, is to step in as Xerox’s new CEO. On Wednesday Xerox said net income attributable to the company dropped to $23 million, or 8 cents per share, in the quarter ended March 31 from $40 million, or 14 cents per share, a year earlier. The company earned an adjusted profit of 68 cents per share, missing average analysts’ estimate of 73 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Quarterly earnings from continuing operations was down from last year primarily due to lower equity income, including the Xerox share of a Fuji Xerox restructuring charge, the company said in a statement. Total revenue was nearly flat at $2.44 billion, above the $2.41 billion analysts had expected."

Net income attributable to Xerox fell to $23 million, or 8 cents per share, in the quarter ended March 31, from $40 million, or 14 cents per share, a year earlier. Quarterly earnings from continuing operations was down from last year primarily due to lower equity income, including the Xerox share of a Fuji Xerox restructuring charge, the company said in a statement.

In addition to Jacobson, six others of the 10-member board will be replaced by members backed by Icahn and Deason, while the two shareholders will withdraw their proxy fight as part of the settlement. Fujifilm, which saw its shares drop 5.5 percent in Tokyo after news of the ouster, said it planned to file an objection with a court over the settlement. It will also appeal last week’s court ruling, it said in a statement, adding that Xerox’s new board had an obligation to comply with agreements in January. In a complex deal, Fuji Xerox would buy back Fujifilm’s 75 percent stake in their joint venture before Fujifilm would then purchase 50.1 percent of new Xerox shares.

-11.692880164762503," Exclusive: Apollo Global approaches Xerox about possible acquisition - sources (Reuters) - Buyout firm Apollo Global Management LLC APO.N has approached Xerox Corp XRX.N to express interest in a possible acquisition, casting new uncertainty over the U.S. printer company's $6.1 billion sale to Japan's Fujifilm Holdings 4901.T, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. The development marks the latest twist in Xerox’s saga. On Tuesday, Xerox said its chief executive, Jeff Jacobson, and most of its board will step down to settle a lawsuit by activist shareholders Carl Icahn and Darwin Deason. Apollo's interest in Xerox has been reinforced by the appointment of John Visentin as the company's new CEO, the sources said. Visentin was previously CEO of Novitex Enterprise Solutions and also chairman of Presidio Inc PSDO.O, two companies in which Apollo invested. There is no certainty that Apollo’s approach will entice Xerox or that it will lead to a deal. Fujifilm has said it will challenge a court order suspending its deal with Xerox, while the new board of the latter reviews it. The sources asked not to be identified because the approach is confidential. Apollo and Xerox declined to comment, while Fujifilm did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Deason declined to comment while Icahn could not be reached for comment. Xerox shares pared losses on news of Apollo’s approach, and were down 5.8 percent at $30.42 on Wednesday afternoon after plunging as much as 8 percent on news of the outcome of Icahn and Deason’s legal challenge. Xerox has a market capitalization of $7 billion. As part of the settlement with Icahn and Deason announced on Tuesday, Xerox said its board of directors would meet immediately to begin evaluating all strategic alternatives to maximize shareholder value, including ending or restructuring Xerox’s deal with Fujifilm. Icahn and Deason had already won a rare court order to temporarily block the deal, which they said undervalued Xerox.

-17.344509832036806," New York judge halts Xerox deal. Would Delaware have done the same? (Reuters) - We will never know if consolidated shareholder litigation to block Fujifilm’s $6.1 billion acquisition of Xerox Corp would have turned out differently had it taken place in Delaware Chancery Court instead of New York State Supreme Court. But a dramatic decision in the Xerox case has spurred lawyers and academics to ask whether Delaware has become too deferential to corporate boards. On Friday, Manhattan State Supreme Court Justice Barry Ostrager issued a preliminary injunction barring Xerox from holding a shareholder vote on the proposed Fuji merger at its annual meeting in June. After a two-day evidentiary hearing in which Justice Ostrager heard live testimony from eight witnesses, including Xerox’s CEO and the chairman of its board, the judge concluded the Fuji deal was so tainted with conflict that it was likely the CEO and the board, abetted by Fuji, had breached their duty to Xerox shareholders. The judge also ruled that Xerox must allow activist shareholder Darwin Deason to nominate an alternative slate of directors at the meeting in June. Ostrager blocked the deal even though a highly credentialed board unanimously approved the Fuji offer and no bidder has emerged with better terms than the complex, no-cash transaction Fuji proposed. Xerox’s lawyers at Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison had argued that the board’s fully-informed approval, which came after 10 months of board-supervised negotiations and some heated internal debate, showed independent directors acting carefully to decide what’s best for shareholders. Justice Ostrager found that depiction to be not credible, adopting instead the account of events proffered by Deason’s lawyers at King & Spalding and lead shareholder class action counsel from Grant & Eisenhofer and Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann. In their depiction, Xerox’s CEO, Jeff Jacobson, was on the verge of losing his job under pressure from activist Carl Icahn, who, along with Deason, controls about 15 percent of Xerox shares. As Xerox’s board was searched for Jacobson’s replacement, Jacobson stepped up desultory talks with Fuji, a Xerox joint venture partner, proposing a deal structure that would minimize Fuji’s cash outlay. Fuji executives, sensing an opportunity to take advantage of Jacobson’s precarious state, promised to keep him in charge. And the board, despite some early opposition, went along with the deal because Fuji pledged to retain five Xerox directors after the merger. The judge agreed Jacobson’s priority in the Fuji deal was his own job – and the board didn’t give enough weight to Jacobson’s conflict. “Once Jacobson learned that he had been targeted for replacement by Xerox’s largest shareholder and eventually the board itself, he abandoned the board’s request to obtain a value-maximizing all-cash transaction and engineered the framework for a one-sided deal that includes Jacobson retaining his position as CEO post-transaction,” wrote Justice Ostrager (who was formerly an ace corporate defense litigator at Simpson Thacher & Bartlett). “There is ample evidence that he collaborated with Fuji to make himself indispensable to the transaction.” One of the most damning documents, which Ostrager said would have been sufficient by itself to prove the board’s likely breach of its fiduciary duty, was a text message, witnessed by board chairman Robert Keegan and another director, in which Jacobson told a high-ranking Fuji executive that he and Fuji were a “team” aligned against Icahn, their “mutual enemy.” From nearly the beginning of the litigation, said Deason lawyer Richard Marooney of K&S and shareholder class action lawyer James Sabella of G&E, Ostrager was determined to hear from Xerox witnesses, not just lawyers on both sides. Last month he set a punishing pre-trial schedule, including a pair of depositions in Japan of Fuji witnesses. “He did it right,” said Marooney, who credited his firm’s New York litigators for running at the judge’s fast pace. He wanted to understand the facts, and not just on paper. He wanted to get to the truth.” That hearing probably wouldn’t have happened, said shareholder lawyer Sabella, if this case had been litigated in Delaware. As recently as 2012, Delaware judges would, in rare instances, enjoin transactions. In 2011, Vice-Chancellor Travis Laster blocked a shareholder vote on a $3.5 billion leveraged buyout of Del Monte because of its financial advisor’s alleged conflicts. The following year, Chancellor Leo Strine (now Chief Justice of the Delaware Supreme Court) enjoined Martin Marietta’s hostile tender offer for Vulcan Materials. But in 2014’s C&J Energy Services v. City of Miami General Employees’ and Sanitation Employees’ Retirement Trust, the Delaware Supreme Court reversed an injunction against C&J’s merger with Nabors Industries. The state justices essentially said that when independent boards exercise their business judgment to approve strategic mergers – and give shareholders a right to vote on the deals – Chancery Court should not stand in the way, particularly if there’s no competing bid for the company. Since then, said Harvard law school professor Guhan Subramanian, the trajectory in Delaware Chancery Court has been away from scrutiny of deal processes. Subramanian, who was an expert witness for shareholders in the Xerox case, said he was impressed that, in contrast to Delaware courts in recent years, Justice Ostrager was willing “to engage in a meaningful way” with details of the deal. Even if Delaware judges were deciding the Xerox case based on the record developed before Justice Ostrager, said Brooklyn Law professor Minor Myers, they might well have rejected shareholder attempts to block the deal. “You could easily image a Chancery judge, with all the factual findings, nevertheless saying, ‘I’m going to let shareholders vote,’” said Myers, who was not involved in the Xerox case but read Friday’s ruling. It’s going to be interesting, said shareholder lawyer Sabella, to track whether shareholders who suspect deals were tainted by real conflicts try to find a way to bring their cases in New York after the Xerox decision. Xerox is incorporated in New York, so filing in state court in Manhattan was an easy call for its shareholders. But for shareholders of Delaware-incorporated companies headquartered in New York, “this decision is going to make New York a more attractive jurisdiction,” Sabella said. I emailed Xerox counsel Jay Cohen of Paul Weiss and Fuji lawyers Erik Olson and James Hough of Morrison & Foerster but didn’t hear back. Xerox told Reuters on Friday that it will appeal Justice Ostrager’s ruling. “The company strongly believes that its shareholders should be allowed to exercise their right to vote on the transaction and decide for themselves,” Xerox said. “The Xerox board undertook a rigorous process to reach its decision to approve the proposed transaction, including a comprehensive review of the company’s strategic and financial alternatives, as well as potential transaction structures in its negotiations with Fujifilm.”"
-17.344509832036806," U.S. judge blocks Fujifilm, Xerox merger temporarily (Reuters) - Fujifilm Holdings Corp’s merger with U.S. firm Xerox Corp was temporarily blocked on Friday following a court ruling, handing its activist investors a win after they sued to stop the deal. The ruling reopened nominations to Xerox’s board on Friday after investor Darwin Deason filed a lawsuit against the company last month opposing the deal and asking to add his own nominees to the board. The preliminary injunction came a day after the companies reopened deal talks on their $6.1-billion merger. They are discussing a higher price after Xerox, under pressure from top investors, asked to renegotiate the terms. Judge Barry Ostrager of the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, granted the injunctions, saying Xerox Chief Executive Officer Jeff Jacobson sought to conclude the deal even though he was advised to end negotiations. “The facts abduced at the evidentiary hearing clearly show that Jacobson, having been told on Nov. 10 that the Board was actively seeking a new CEO to replace him, was hopelessly conflicted during his negotiation of a strategic acquisition transaction that would result in a combined entity of which he would be CEO,” the decision said. The proposed merger is opposed by Deason and Carl Icahn, two of Xerox’s top shareholders, who have said the agreement dramatically undervalues Xerox. Fujifilm said it would consider all options, including whether to appeal against the decision. “We disagree with and are disappointed by the judge’s ruling,” the Japanese firm said in a statement. “We strongly believe that all Xerox shareholders should be able to decide for themselves the operational, financial, and strategic merits of the transaction. Xerox said it disagrees with the ruling and “will immediately appeal the court’s decision”. “The company strongly believes that its shareholders should be allowed to exercise their right to vote on the transaction and decide for themselves,” the company said. It added that it believes a combination with Fuji Xerox is the best path forward to create value for shareholders. “The Xerox board undertook a rigorous process to reach its decision to approve the proposed transaction, including a comprehensive review of the company’s strategic and financial alternatives, as well as potential transaction structures in its negotiations with Fujifilm over a 10-month period.” Deason said in a statement that he is “grateful the court acted to protect the shareholders of Xerox.” In February, Deason asked a court to block the merger with Fujifilm Holdings, arguing the U.S. photocopier maker’s board had failed shareholders by approving a deal that undervalues the company. Icahn and Deason, who own a combined 15 percent of the U.S. printer and copier maker, have called the deal structure “tortured” and “convoluted”.

-13.188855835910077," Lawsuit alleges Xerox CEO disregarded board in pursuing Fuji deal: WSJ (Reuters) - A lawsuit is alleging that Xerox Corp XRX.N Chief Executive Officer Jeff Jacobson pursued a deal with Fujifilm Holdings Corp 4901.T, even after Xerox's board advised him to halt negotiations, the Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday. Fujifilm and Xerox struck a $6.1 billion deal in January to combine the U.S. company into their existing joint venture, Fuji Xerox, to gain scale and cut costs as demand for office printing equipment declines. The board advised Jacobson in November to halt negotiations because it was considering firing him, the newspaper reported, citing an amended suit filed in a New York state court on Sunday by Darwin Deason, a Xerox holder who opposes the deal, saying it undervalues the copier and printer company. The company denied the assertion in a statement on Sunday. “Xerox CEO Jeff Jacobson was fully authorized to engage in discussions with Fujifilm and Fuji Xerox on the proposed combination,” Xerox Chairman Robert Keegan said in the statement. He added that the lawsuit “distorts many of the facts regarding the proposed combination with Fuji Xerox.” Deason and activist shareholder Carl Icahn, who together hold about 15 percent of Xerox shares, are fighting the combination, which they say “disproportionately” favors Fuji. They are separately looking to shake up the Xerox board. Deason wants to nominate directors to the Xerox board, despite missing a deadline, arguing in his suit that the current board had made a series of significant decisions and disclosures to stockholders after the nomination deadline. A representative for Deason was not immediately available for comment outside regular business hours."
