-36.34462258651151," UPDATE 1-U.S. FTC approves Penn National's purchase of Pinnacle with divestitures (Adds assets to be sold to Boyd Gaming Corp, background) WASHINGTON, Oct 1 (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission on Monday approved casino operator Penn National Gaming Inc’s $2.8 billion purchase of Pinnacle Entertainment Inc, requiring they divest assets in three Midwestern cities. The deal is the latest in a series of mergers and acquisitions in the U.S. gambling sector in recent years as companies look to expand their reach, diversify their businesses and take advantage of recent legalization of gaming in some states. The FTC said the companies should sell casino-related assets in Cincinnati, St. Louis and Kansas City, Missouri, to Boyd Gaming Corp. The cash-and-stock deal, which would cement Penn National’s position as the leading U.S. regional gaming operator, was announced in December. Penn National said at the time that after the deal it would operate a combined 41 properties with about 53,500 slots, 1,300 tables and 8,300 hotel rooms in the United States.

-23.010920414931313," Boyd Gaming and Paddy Power's FanDuel partner on U.S. mobile sports bets NEW YORK (Reuters) - Casino operator Boyd Gaming Corp and fantasy sports company FanDuel Group on Thursday said they were joining in a strategic partnership to run online and mobile sports betting operations in the United States. The partnership comes after other recent agreements that broaden the reach and size of major players in the new U.S. legal sports betting market, which is beginning to take shape in the wake of a May court decision allowing states to legalize the wagers. On Monday, Boyd had also announced a separate deal with MGM Resorts International, to help bolster U.S. market access. Boyd’s deal with FanDuel will extend to MGM, wherever mobile sports betting is allowed in those states where MGM operates, a Boyd spokesman said. FanDuel and Boyd will co-brand and cross-promote each other’s products. The spokesman declined to provide additional details of the agreement. FanDuel was acquired by Irish sportsbook operator Paddy Power Betfair PLC in a deal that closed last month. The race is on for technology, data and sportsbook companies to team up and compete in the emerging U.S. sports betting market. On Wednesday, FanDuel rival DraftKings Inc became the first company to roll out mobile sports betting in New Jersey with a soft-launch of a new app. The only other state currently providing statewide mobile sports betting is Nevada, though some others, particularly West Virginia, are considering it."
