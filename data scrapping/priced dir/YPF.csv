-15.21739130434782," UPDATE 4-Argentina's YPF bonds rally after partial debt swap (New throughout, updates bond prices) BUENOS AIRES, Feb 11 (Reuters) - YPF bonds rallied on Thursday after the Argentine state energy giant said it had received support from holders of almost 60% of its bond maturing next month to restructure the debt, helping defuse near-term default fears. The company, which leads development of the huge Vaca Muerta shale formation in the South American nation, said the result meant it had received support from the central bank to get access to the dollars it needed to pay off its obligations. YPF said in a statement it had support from 59.79% of holders of the 2021 bond, which was in focus ahead of a $413 million payment due next month it was struggling to pay because the central bank has tightened access to foreign exchange. YPF shares rose 1.8% in New York and fell 1.8% in Buenos Aires, while most of its bonds involved in the restructuring plan rallied to close the day. The March 2021 bond rose 4 cents, while the 2025 and 2027 rose about 3.8 cents each, according to Refinitiv data. Support for the other six bonds in the planned larger $6.2 billion restructuring was substantially lower, at between around 19%-43% for the notes expiring between 2024-2047, after leading creditor groups withheld support of revamping those notes. “YPF reached a participation level of the short-term bond of 60% and of the bonds overall close to 32%,” a company source told Reuters, adding this would result in the issuance of 2026, 2029 and 2033 notes of around $2.1 billion. The person, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the revamp meant the company had received the central bank’s go-ahead to access the dollars it would need to pay off its commitments, as well as “freeing up resources for productive investments”. A spokesman for Argentina’s central bank (BCRA) told Reuters that “owing to the successful debt restructuring within BCRA regulations, today YPF will be able to access the official market to make payments on their maturities.” Argentina, in a recession since 2018, has imposed strict capital controls as it battles against falling reserves and looks to protect the local peso currency. The Ad Hoc creditor group, which includes investors like BlackRock, celebrated the agreement on the 2021 bonds. “The Group will be available to engage with YPF again should it become necessary in a good faith process,” it said in a statement on Thursday.

The debt exchange offer, which expires on Friday, has roiled YPF’s shares and bonds in recent weeks and thrown a spotlight on its struggles in the face of the global COVID-19 pandemic that has hit energy prices and demand. The YPF Ad Hoc Bondholder Group, represented by Clifford Chance LLP, says it holds over 45% of YPF’s March 23, 2021 bonds and that the latest offer was an improvement, but “fails to provide a balanced solution,” including “appropriate treatment” for bonds maturing next month. That creditor group said it submitted a counter-proposal “that would provide additional cash flow flexibility and interest savings over the next several years with below-market interest rates,” according to its statement. A second group, led by Dechert LLP and DLA Piper Argentina, said it supported the latest offer made on Monday. The group said it holds over 25% of all of seven series of YPF notes involved. “Through these amendments, the Exchange Offer and the underlying commercial terms have been significantly improved, bringing the Exchange Offer in-line with market standards,” the second group said in a statement. “Any further improvements look difficult to achieve due to the combination of timing constraints and the existing capital controls in Argentina.” The 2025 issue added under a cent to trade at 82.43 cents on the dollar according to Refinitiv data. The 2027 and 2029 issues were unchanged on the day. The bond maturing next month was little changed as well, according to Refinitiv data. YPF’s U.S.-listed shares were down over 2%.

-37.41379310344828," UPDATE 1-Argentina energy giant YPF seeks $1 bln swap to delay 2021 bond (Adds Fitch comment) BUENOS AIRES, July 2 (Reuters) - Argentine state energy giant YPF on Thursday that it was seeking a swap deal on $1 billion of international bonds to push back payments currently due in March 2021, a move which comes as the sector has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic. The company said in a statement that it would offer a swap that included a cash payment along with new instruments maturing in 2025. The new bonds would maintain the current coupon of 8.5% with amortization payments starting in 2022, it added. “YPF is actively looking for competitive alternatives as part of its financial plan for the year, which includes, among other things, the possibility of extending the maturity of this new series to improve its debt profile,” it said. The proposed swap, which avoids a haircut on the debt, comes as the South American country’s government races to restructure around $65 billion in foreign bonds that have become unsustainable after two straight years of economic recession. Fitch Ratings, which assigned a “CCC”/”RR4” rating to the proposed new 2025 bond, said that the decision reflected the agency’s view “that the transaction does not constitute a substantial reduction in original terms.” Argentina’s oil industry was severely affected by the coronavirus pandemic, which sparked a historic drop in the price of oil and gas worldwide, while a fall in consumption has led to increased inventories.

YPF’s revenues grew 33.4%, reaching 174.7 billion pesos, the company said in a statement. The firm posted a net loss of 8.153 billion pesos ($180.3 million) in the first quarter of 2019. “It should be clarified that, from the second half of March 2020, some indicators began to be impacted by the mandatory isolation measures to prevent the circulation and spread of the COVID-19 virus,” the statement said. “This phenomenon has affected the industry globally, and in this context, YPF is not exempt.” YPF announced salary cuts of between 10% and 25% that are expected to last for several months until the impact of the coronavirus begins to subside, according to a YPF source. The South American nation, which is home to the huge Vaca Muerta shale play, was rattled last year by recession, high inflation, volatile markets and a mounting debt crisis that has hurt domestic production and investment."

The spokesman for YPF said the company’s Plaza Huincul Refinery, which normally produces about 28,000 barrels per day (bpd), was operating with minimum staff levels, but had not entirely halted production. A methanol refinery that was part of the complex continued to operate as normal, he added.

Loma Campana is the most important development site for YPF in Vaca Muerta, a formation in Patagonia similar in size to the whole of Belgium and thought to be home to one of the largest unconventional reserves in the world. Regional newspaper Diario Río Negro said YPF had cut production by around 50% at the flagship prospect, hit by a national quarantine that has been in place since mid-March and has sapped domestic demand. YPF declined to comment on Thursday. Global shale firms have been hurt badly by the global pandemic as well as an oil war that has dashed prices. OPEC and its allies agreed on Thursday to cut their oil output by more than a fifth to prop up prices. YPF, which is developing the Loma Campana concession with Chevron Corp, describes it as the top non-conventional development outside North America.

38.931297709923655," Argentina's YPF oil firm says demand already down, warns of 'difficult' future BUENOS AIRES, March 24 (Reuters) - Argentine state-run oil company YPF has already seen a drop in energy consumption because of a nationwide mandatory quarantine over the coronavirus announced last Friday, a company executive said in an internal video obtained by local newspaper La Nacion on Tuesday and confirmed to Reuters by the company Daniel Gonzalez, YPF’s executive president, told employees in the video that major drops in demand for all fuels meant that “very difficult” times were coming and the company’s income would be impacted, the newspaper reported. A spokesman for YPF, which leads production activities in the Vaca Muerta shale play, told Reuters the video was for the company’s internal use, but confirmed its veracity. “The demand for gasoline is 70% below that of the previous days, diesel is closer to 50% and aviation fuel is down about 90%,” Gonzalez said in the video, according to La Nacion. “This will leave us with the need to export crude oil at low prices, with which our income will clearly be negatively affected.” His message comes as the South American country recorded two new coronavirus deaths on Tuesday, bringing the death toll to six, with 301 confirmed cases. Gonzalez said gas production was falling with demand and already “between 15 and 20% below what it was in previous days.” “Oil production is practically unaffected. We have stopped drilling and completing wells. We are wrapping up leaving the last new wells and equipment in a safe condition,” the executive said, adding his thanks to the workers who continue to keep the company running. The Argentine government ordered a mandatory quarantine from last Friday until March 31, dealing a significant blow to an economy already in recession, with high rates of inflation and poverty.

Argentina’s export joins a wave of new supply flooding the spot market which has depressed Asian spot prices to their lowest in a decade for this time of the year. The state-owned firm issued a tender which closed on Nov. 6 to sell 2.1 trillion British thermal unit (Tbtu) of LNG for loading from FLNG Tango, the liquefaction vessel off Bahia Blanca, the sources said. YPF exported its first test LNG shipment in June, but this was its first commercial cargo, they added. The cargo loaded from the facility on Oct. 26 on the LNG tanker Excalibur and is now moored off Bahia Blanca with destination stated as Atlantic Basin, shiptracking data from Refinitiv showed. Bahia Blanca is a small port city not far from the Argentine capital Buenos Aires. Details of the buyer were not immediately available. The Excalibur is chartered by YPF, two shipping sources said, meaning that the cargo was sold on a delivered-ex-ship (DES) basis, unlike the test cargo. The test cargo was loaded on the same vessel but at that time it was chartered by U.S. producer Cheniere, they said. “It takes around 40 days to produce and load a full cargo...their next one will be on the vessel Methane Kari Elin,” one of the traders said. YPF said in June it began loading the first shipment of LNG for export from Argentina, a milestone for the country which is looking to exploit its huge Vaca Muerta shale play. “The (first commercial cargo) will likely end up in Europe or Americas as they don’t have the shipping length,” the trader added. FLNG Tango, owned by Belgian shipping company Exmar , arrived in Bahia Blanca in February. Argentina is typically an importer of LNG. It buys pipeline gas from neighbouring countries and also produces its own gas. But rising output from Vaca Muerta, one of the world’s largest reserves of shale oil and gas, helped it reduce LNG imports by more than 20% last year to 2.6 million tonnes, according to industry group GIIGNL.

-50.69436375774836," U.S. Supreme Court rejects Argentina appeal over YPF energy company WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday rejected Argentina’s bid to fend off a lawsuit by energy company Petersen Energía Inversora, S.A. seeking compensation for shares it owned in the now-nationalized YPF S.A. energy company. The justices left in place a lower court ruling that allowed privately held Petersen to sue after Argentina’s government refused to buy back the company’s shares. The New York-based 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in July 2018 rejected arguments by Argentina and YPF that the suit should be dismissed because a U.S. law called the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act deprives U.S. courts of jurisdiction over “sovereign acts of expropriation.” A unanimous three-judge 2nd Circuit panel ruled that the suit fell into the law’s exception for commercial activity. The Madrid-based Petersen subsidiaries were not challenging the expropriation itself but said that the action had triggered shareholder protection provisions in YPF’s bylaws, which were added when YPF began trading on the New York Stock Exchange in 1993. The appeals court upheld a 2016 ruling by U.S. District Judge Loretta Preska in Manhattan. “The company will utilize all the legal recourses necessary to defend its interests,” YPF said in a statement to the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange. YPF shares fell 1.08% to 772.85 pesos on the Buenos Aires Stock Exchange, and its American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) fell 0.22% to $18.18 on Monday afternoon after the court’s decision. In 2012, the Argentina expropriated 51 percent of YPF’s shares, all from Repsol S.A., but declined to tender an offer to buy out other shareholders."
26.12300719665841," Argentina authorizes new gas exports to Chile BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina’s energy secretariat said on Wednesday it authorized oil companies YPF and Total to make new gas exports to neighboring Chile. The exports will take place in an eight-month period of lower local demand in Argentina. The government authorized state-controlled oil company YPF SA to send 500,000 cubic meters per day, and French company Total SA to send 1.5 million cubic meters per day, the secretariat said in a statement. The announcement came after a meeting between Argentine Energy Secretary Gustavo Lopetegui and Chilean President Sebastian Pinera in Buenos Aires. In October of last year, Argentina began exporting natural gas to Chile after a 12-year interlude. Argentina, which sits atop the world’s No. 2 shale gas reserves, was once a major supplier of natural gas to Chile, but triggered a diplomatic crisis in the mid-2000s by cutting off shipments when its own supplies ran low. “Increasing the volumes exported to Chile is the first step. Our great challenge is to continue increasing production to supply the domestic market and be able to export gas all through the year,” Lopetegui said in the statement. Representatives from YPF and Total did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Argentina exported an average of 5 million cubic meters per day during the most recent summer months when local demand is lower."

State-owned Petronas will have an equal stake in the project through its subsidiary Petronas E&P Argentina SA, the presidency said in a statement. Petronas has not yet commented on the announcement. The Belgium-sized Vaca Muerta deposit, located in western Argentina, is regarded as having the world’s second-largest shale gas and fourth-largest shale oil deposits. “This investment will allow us to increase YPF’s petrol production by 30 percent by 2022, which will represent a total increase for Argentina of 15 percent,” the statement said. The companies’ objective is to reach a production equivalent of 60,000 barrels a day by 2022, it said. Total investment could reach $7 billion within 20 years, it said. Successive governments have targeted Vaca Muerta to reverse Argentina’s energy deficit but the plans have been hindered by a lack of infrastructure. YPF chief executive Daniel Gonzalez told Reuters last month the company would bolster both unconventional oil and gas production by investing between $4 billion and $5 billion per year through 2022. Petronas and YPF have already partnered in pilot exploration and production initiatives and will begin development of the unconventional fuel project in the Amarga Chica block in the province of Neuquen. The announcement is good news for the beleaguered government of Mauricio Macri, which was forced to seek an IMF bailout earlier this year. Macri discussed the deal in a meeting on Tuesday with YPF president Miguel Gutiérrez, Finance Minister Nicolás Dujovne and Energy Secretary Javier Iguacel, the president’s statement said."
4.03196728502225," Argentina's YPF to spend billions to boost oil and gas output BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina’s state-controlled oil company, YPF, will significantly boost oil and gas production, investing between $4 billion and $5 billion per year through 2022, Chief Executive Daniel Gonzalez told Reuters on Friday. It plans to raise production by between 5 percent and 7 percent per year, with the largest increase in the Vaca Muerta formation, one of the world’s largest reserves of shale oil and gas. The company intends to invest $3.6 billion on infrastructure in Vaca Muerta over the next five years, Gonzalez said, adding that the company is looking to speed up shale oil and gas extraction, with 1,700 wells drilled by 2023. YPF shares jumped 4.3 percent to 562.35 pesos ($15.20) per unit in afternoon trade, after having traded down 2.5 percent earlier in the day. “Crude oil is going to grow, I would say twice as fast as natural gas for us in the next five years,” Gonzalez said. “Having said that, crude oil production will be seven times what it is today and shale gas will be four times what it is today in five years. So there will be a significant growth in unconventional (shale) production,” he said. The company also plans to begin exporting gas to Chile, and investing in offshore exploration in the Argentina’s Gulf of San Jorge, on the southern Atlantic coast. Gonzalez said the plans would allow YPF to double its dividends every year over the next three years. “We are going to do that in a very disciplined way, reducing our debt significantly, increasing our dividends and more importantly generating cash that we can invest in new ventures. All of this growth can be financed organically by the company, by markets and our cash generation,” Gonzalez said. YPF said it will also double its electricity generation capacity, and that 20 percent of that electricity would come from renewable sources by 2023. While YPF is the leading investor in Vaca Muerta, the Argentine government has tried to spur investment in the region with a labor agreement to incentivize competition among oil and gas drillers, construction companies and mid-stream service providers."

In February, YPF announced it had sold a 24.99 percent stake in its YPF Energia Electrica unit to GE for $276 million. At the time, it said it was in advanced talks with a third partner, but those negotiations have not borne fruit. “We do not have an open process,” YPF Chairman Miguel Gutierrez told reporters, referring to the search for a third party. The unit - which will be known as YPF Luz and operate independently from the oil company - will raise its capacity to 4,500 megawatts per hour by 2022 or 2023, Gutierrez said. That would make it Argentina’s third-largest generator. Currently, it is the fifth-largest and produces 1,800 megawatts per hour.
