-6.967213114754095," U.S. court backs FTC lawsuit to block Peabody, Arch Resources JV (Reuters) - Coal miner Peabody Energy said on Tuesday a district court has upheld the U.S. Federal Trade Commission’s lawsuit to block the company’s joint venture with Arch Resources in Wyoming. The FTC in February moved to block the venture, which combined the Powder River Basin and Colorado assets of the firms, claiming it would eliminate competition. Peabody and Arch had then said they intended to challenge FTC’s decision and would continue to pursue the JV. The court ruling signals more woes for coal miners, which have suffered due to increasing competition from cheap and abundant gas and subsidized renewable energy, along with rising public concern over climate change. Peabody’s shares fell more than 16% after the ruling, while Arch was down 8.2%. The JV was formed in June 2019, combining two productive and adjacent U.S. coal mines – Arch’s Black Thunder mine and Peabody’s North Antelope Rochelle mine. It was owned 66.5% by Peabody and 33.5% by Arch. In a separate statement on Tuesday, Arch said it has terminated a thermal asset joint venture with Peabody and plans to pursue strategic alternatives. The company added it would continue to streamline its corporate structure as part of its ongoing transition into a pure-play metallurgical coal producer."

-42.727272727272734," U.S. FTC files suit to block Peabody and Arch Coal JV in Wyoming (Reuters) - The U.S. Federal Trade Commission said on Wednesday it has filed a lawsuit to block a joint venture in Wyoming between coal mining companies Peabody Energy Corp and Arch Coal Inc as it would allegedly eliminate competition. Peabody’s shares were down 8.8%, while those of Arch Coal slipped 4.3%. The FTC said it filed a complaint for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. Peabody and Arch Coal said on Wednesday they intend to challenge the FTC’s decision in the coming months, adding they will continue to pursue the joint venture announced in 2019. “We have provided tremendous amounts of evidence to the FTC during an extensive review, fully demonstrating that coal ... faces intense competition from natural gas and other alternate fuels,” Peabody Chief Executive Officer Glenn Kellow said. The coal industry has been in steep decline for a decade due to competition from cheap and abundant gas and subsidized solar and wind energy, along with rising public concern over coal’s contribution to climate change. Peabody had said in June last year it would combine its Powder River Basin and Colorado coal assets with Arch Coal in a joint venture with Peabody owning 66.5% and Arch the remaining."

-43.75483347378374," Peabody expects third quarter to be hit by lower demand, prices (Reuters) - Coal producer Peabody Energy Corp said on Thursday it expected third-quarter earnings to be lower than the second quarter due to lower demand and prices as well as a delay in ramping up production at its Queensland mine in Australia. Peabody’s warning comes just months after the company said it expects progressive rise in both seaborne thermal and metallurgical coal volumes in the second half of the year. Analysts on average had expected the company to post revenue of $1.21 billion in the third quarter, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. The company said the delay in ramping up production at the Middlemount joint venture mine in Queensland was due to a highwall failure and fatality in late June. The delay will result in third-quarter earnings being $30 million to $35 million lower than the second. While Peabody confirmed its full-year forecasts, it warned that recent trends suggest capital expenditure and seaborne coal volumes are likely to come in at the lower end of its annual target range. The market for seaborne coal often grabs attention as it is more visible to investors, traders and even environmentalists opposed to coal mining."

-8.55343677912105," Peabody Energy to shut parts of Queensland mine after fire (Reuters) - Coal miner Peabody Energy said on Thursday it intends to permanently seal the area where high methane levels have been concentrated after it reported fire in parts of its North Goonyella mine in Australia’s Queensland last month. The company said three of the mine’s five openings remain temporarily sealed to reduce air flow into the mine and issued force majeure notices to coal customers and vendors. The coal miner expects the fire to have financial impacts to future periods and intends to provide an account of the financial and other impacts in its third-quarter earnings report. “The market for metcoal was already pretty tight. North Goonyella was producing decent volume so it’s certainly going to have an impact on the market,” said Lachlan Shaw, a UBS analyst in Melbourne. “That said, spot is up 10 percent at $220 (per tonne) for premium ex Qld coal, compared to before everyone found out about North Goonyella. I think it’s supportive to the markets, but to a large extent already priced in,” he said."
