6.403717339297871," Insurer Travelers' profit beats estimates on investment gains, fewer claims (Reuters) - Property and casualty insurer Travelers Cos Inc reported a jump in quarterly profit that beat analysts’ estimates on Thursday, helped by an increase in returns from investments and lower catastrophe claims. Travelers reported a core income of $1.26 billion, or $4.91 per share, in the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with $867 million, or $3.32 per share, a year earlier. Analysts had expected a profit of $3.18 per share on average, according to Refinitiv data. New York-based Travelers, seen as a bellwether for the insurance sector as it typically reports before its industry peers, said net written premiums rose 3% to $7.27 billion for the reported quarter. The insurer’s strong quarter caps off a year of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has had a far less impact on property casualty insurers than many investors expected, mainly because of pandemic-related exclusions in their contracts. Travelers posted $31 million in pre-tax COVID losses for the quarter. It is adding communicable disease exclusions to some policies as workplaces reopen, and being cautious in its approach to potential future workers’ compensation losses, executives said during a call with analysts. Underwriting gains rose to $955 million from $513 million a year earlier, while pre-tax net investment income rose 10% to $677 million, helped by gains in its non-fixed income investment portfolio. The company reported a combined ratio of 86.7%, compared with 92.4% a year earlier. A ratio below 100% means the insurer earned more in premiums than it paid out in claims. Travelers reported catastrophe loss net of reinsurance of $29 million in the quarter, compared with $85 million a year earlier. Full-year losses jumped to $1.6 billion, impacted mainly by tornados, storms, hurricanes and civil unrest in the United States. Shares of Travelers, a Dow component, were up 3.3% on Thursday."

The New York-based company, seen as a bellwether for the insurance sector as it typically reports before its industry peers, said net written premiums rose 3% to $7.77 billion in the quarter. Core income stood at $3.12 per share, above analysts’ average estimate of $3.03 per share, according to Refinitiv. Total revenue rose 3%. Overall profit more than doubled to $827 million, or $3.23 per share, in the quarter ended Sept. 30, thanks also to a one-time gain of about $403 million from Pacific Gas & Electric’s emergence from bankruptcy. The gain, which stemmed from payments Travelers made for claims on wildfires in California in 2017 and 2018, had been flagged last quarter at an anticipated $400 million. The profit rise was despite catastrophe losses that were well above the 10-year average for the third quarter, Chief Executive Officer Alan Schnitzer said. However, the quarter saw lower revenue from fixed income investments and the need to bolster reserves for asbestos claims to $295 million. Travelers reported pretax catastrophe losses of $397 million, mainly from severe storms in several regions of the United States and wildfires. It reported an increase in revenue from non-fixed income investments, which include private equity, whose results are reported with a one-quarter time lag. Claims and claim adjustment expense fell to $4.89 billion from $5.23 billion. The company reported a combined ratio of 94.9% compared with 101.5% a year earlier.

It said last week that pre-tax insurance losses directly related to the pandemic amounted to $114 million. Net investment income fell 380% to $268 million due to lower returns from its fixed income portfolio business, dented by low interest rates. Insurers’ investments are coming under pressure and the investments they rely on to pay claims are facing major hurdles. They manage more than $20 trillion in assets globally, but their big government bond holdings are becoming problematic as the threat of recession grows and central banks’ interest rate cuts have sent yields plunging.

19.10494865026201," Travelers sees rising claims as coronavirus crisis spreads (Reuters) - Property and casualty insurer Travelers Cos Inc TRV.N reported a 25% drop in quarterly profit on Tuesday and warned that potential claims tied to compensation coverage for furloughed and laid-off employees would hit results for the year. The coronavirus pandemic has brought global financial markets to a virtual halt, leaving millions of people jobless in America alone and forcing companies to boost their cash reserves. Travelers said it could see ""elevated claims frequency and severity"" for its workers' compensation line as a number of states enact changes designed to effectively expand workers' compensation coverage. travl.rs/2zjWN9X U.S. commercial insurers are facing mounting political pressure to cover claims from businesses that are losing revenue because of coronavirus-led shutdowns ordered by state and local governments. They are being pushed to aid businesses that have been shuttered or had their operations curtailed as lawmakers race to combat the spread of the pandemic. “As a result of COVID-19, economic conditions in the United States and other countries around the world have rapidly deteriorated. The decreased levels of economic activity will negatively impact premium volumes,” Travelers said. The company also booked catastrophe losses of $333 million in the first quarter, compared with $193 million a year earlier. The rise in catastrophe losses was mainly due to a string of tornadoes that tore through Nashville, Tennessee and surrounding counties early in March, with several U.S. regions also seeing wind storms and winter storms. Travelers, often seen as a bellwether for the insurance sector as it typically reports before its industry peers, reported pretax net charges of $86 million related to the COVID-19 pandemic and related economic turmoil. The company’s net income fell to $600 million in the latest quarter ended March 31 from $796 million a year earlier. Core income was $2.62 per share, lagging estimates of $2.85 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Travelers reported a 5% rise in net investment income, but added that the hit from disruptions in global financial markets due to the coronavirus outbreak would be reflected in the second quarter. It expects after-tax net investment income to be about $20 million lower on a quarterly basis for the rest of 2020, hurt by lower reinvestment yields on fixed income investments. Travelers also pulled its outlook for renewal premium change and underlying margins. The company’s shares were down 4.2% at $97.51."

7.601467986086539," Here's what the new U.S. restrictions on Europe mean for travelers WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States will suspend travel from certain European countries for 30 days beginning at midnight on Friday as part of an effort to stem the spread of the coronavirus. - The restrictions cover people who have been in 26 European countries at any point during a 14-day period before their scheduled arrival in the United States. - The targeted countries participate in Europe’s “Schengen Area,” which permits passport-free travel. The countries subject to the new restrictions are Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. - Travelers from the United Kingdom, Ireland and more than a dozen Eastern and Southeastern Europe nations will exempted. Those countries do not participate in the Schengen Area’s passport-free travel. - The restrictions will not apply to U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents, or to spouses, parents and children under the age of 21 of U.S. citizens and permanent residents, among other exceptions. - Flights from the affected European nations will be funneled to 13 airports in the United States that serve 90 percent of existing European flights, according to a U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) official. Boston Logan International Airport and Miami International Airport will be added to a list of 11 airports that have been receiving incoming flights from China and Iran since early February. - At the same time, U.S. airports are cutting flights. Delta Air Lines said Friday it plans to suspend all flights to and from continental Europe for 30 days - a suspension that could start as early as Sunday. - The United States is preparing for thousands of new coronavirus cases and will ask Americans returning from the affected European countries to go into self-quarantine for 14 days as part of the effort to contain the outbreak, Vice President Mike Pence said on Thursday. - Travelers coming from the targeted European countries will be subjected to enhanced entry screening upon arrival in the United States, DHS said in a statement on Friday. During that screening, they will be asked about their medical history, current condition, and contact information, which will be supplied to local health authorities, according to DHS. They will be given written guidance about COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the new coronavirus, and told to self-quarantine at home, the agency said. - President Donald Trump’s proclamation on Wednesday said the Schengen countries had the highest rate of coronavirus infection outside of China, and that “the free flow of people between the Schengen Area countries makes the task of managing the spread of the virus difficult.” - A key question is - What is to stop people from the Schengen region from traveling to the United States via Britain? Theresa Cardinal Brown, director of immigration and cross-border policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington, said while Britain maintains entry and exit records for all travelers, it does not regularly share that information with the United States. But she said it can do so on a case-by-case basis upon request."

-24.648523585463337," U.S. insurer Travelers sets aside 'modest' funds for child sex-abuse claims (Reuters) - Travelers Companies Inc has set aside a “modest” amount of additional money to cover its possible exposure to child sex-abuse claims, the insurer’s finance chief, Daniel Frey, told analysts during an earnings call on Thursday. Two analysts asked about Travelers’ exposure to child sex-abuse lawsuits, as Wall Street tries to figure out how much decades-old policies for churches, non-profits and other organizations may cost the insurance industry. The amount that Travelers set aside was not large enough to detail under disclosure rules, he added. Travelers beat analysts’ estimates for quarterly profit on Thursday, boosted by a rise in premiums and strong underwriting. On an adjusted basis, the company earned $3.32 per share, beating estimates of $3.29 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Total revenue rose 3.4% to $8.06 billion. The sex-abuse claims are being spurred by lawsuits filed in response new statues in a number of U.S. states that waive or eliminate time limits for plaintiffs to sue their alleged abusers and institutions where they worked. A New York law that went into effect last August giving victims a year to sue, regardless of when the abuse occurred, has already prompted hundreds of lawsuits. Similar laws have since became effective in New Jersey and California. Insurers are a footnote to the broader scandal (reut.rs/2GlCZmA) that has swept the Catholic church, as well as universities and groups like the Boy Scouts of America. As claims against such institutions have piled up, defendants have been leaning on insurance policies they bought as far back as the 1940s to offset mounting costs. In general, those policies covered injuries that might occur at a physical location, without excluding sexual abuse, and did not place limits on when customers could seek reimbursement, lawyers said. Travelers first acknowledged possible exposure in April 2019, increasing reserves by between $50 million and $100 million after the New York legislation was signed. Chubb Ltd and Selective Insurance Group Inc have made similar disclosures. But Travelers has seen activity “pretty steadily” throughout the year, Frey said on Thursday. Insurers were not thinking about child sex abuse as an “injury” when they wrote the coverage long ago, said Timothy Lytton, a Georgia State University School of Law professor who has performed research on the topic. “They were thinking about slip and fall, church fires, and grandma falling down cathedral steps,” he said."

9.257890191649057," Travelers profit misses on higher reserves for claims (Reuters) - Insurer Travelers Cos Inc TRV.N reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday as it bolstered its reserves to cover asbestos-related and other claims, sending its shares down nearly 4% in trading before the bell. The insurer said it set aside an additional $220 million for asbestos claims reserves in its business insurance unit, compared with a year earlier. It also set aside higher claims reserves in its commercial auto business. Travelers Chief Executive Officer Alan Schnitzer flagged an “increasingly challenging tort environment” and “higher non-catastrophe weather-related losses” for weak results. Earned premiums rose 4.3% to $7.18 billion, while combined ratio improved to 101.5% from 96.6%. A ratio below 100% means the insurer earns more in premiums than it pays out in claims. Catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance, fell $23 mln to $241 million from a year earlier, after wildfires and hurricanes hit its earnings last year. Net investment income fell about 4% to $622 million. Insurers typically invest money they get from premiums into stocks and bonds to earn profits.

Strong wind and hailstorms during the quarter tore apart homeowners’ roofs, pummeled cars and wreaked havoc, triggering a spate of claims that proved to be challenging for U.S. insurers including Travelers.

10.526960598759615," Travelers profit tops on lower catastrophe losses, shares rise 4 percent (Reuters) - Insurer Travelers Companies Inc’s quarterly profit beat analysts’ estimates on Thursday, as improved underwriting and lower catastrophe losses offset a decline in net investment income, sending its shares to a more than one-year high. Shares of the Dow-component rose as much as 4.2 percent to $141.52, levels last seen in March 2018. The stock was also the second-biggest boost to the Dow Jones Industrial Index. Travelers, considered a bellwether for the insurance industry, sells insurance to U.S. businesses and auto and property insurance to individual customers. The company said net written premiums rose 3 percent to $7.06 billion in the first quarter, with growth across all business lines. Investors were particularly focused on its commercial auto insurance business, which has been posting losses for several years as more plaintiffs lawyers jockey to represent accident victims. However, Travelers raised premium rates for auto insurance in the first quarter, helping to contribute a 6 percent rise in gross written premiums in its insurance business. This also did not lead to a drop in renewal rates and retentions, business insurance head Gregory Toczydlowski said on a call with analysts. “We view this as a decent quarter with favorable pricing commentary,” Janney Montgomery Scott analyst Larry Greenberg said. The company on Thursday reported that catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance, fell by $161 million to $193 million after wildfires and hurricanes dented its earnings over the past two years. The company also said it would raise its dividend by 6.5 percent to an annual rate of $3.28 per share. The company reported a combined ratio of 93.7 percent, compared with 95.5 percent a year earlier. A ratio below 100 percent means the insurer earns more in premiums than it pays out in claims. A weak spot in the quarter, however, was net investment income , which fell 3.5 percent to $582 million due to lower private equity returns after a slowdown in market activity in the first quarter. Insurers typically invest money they get from premiums in bonds and equities to earn profits, and a downturn in markets spells bad news for them. The company’s net income rose 19 percent to $796 million, or $2.99 per share, in the quarter ended March 31. Core income was $2.83 per share, which beat analysts’ estimates of $2.74 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Total revenue rose 5 percent to $7.67 billion."

12.303600707678898," Insurer Travelers beats fourth-quarter profit estimates (Reuters) - Insurer Travelers Cos Inc TRV.N reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter profit on Tuesday, as growth in premiums and investment income offset catastrophe losses related to the California wildfires U.S. property and casualty insurers have been grappling with losses arising from the California wildfires and Hurricane Michael in October, the fiercest storm to hit Florida in 80 years. The industry, including Travelers, is also struggling with growing losses in commercial auto insurance. The problem has been acute for several years and is worsening as more plaintiffs’ lawyers jockey to represent accident victims, said Travelers executives during a call with analysts. Travelers is fielding commercial auto claims for more severe bodily injuries than anticipated, said business insurance head Gregory Toczydlowski. Travelers will seek rate increases as a result, Toczydlowski said. Travelers recorded quarterly pre-tax catastrophe losses of $453 million related to the wildfires and $158 million due to Hurricane Michael. Brokerage RBC Capital Markets was expecting catastrophe losses of $450 million from the California wildfires and $200 million from Hurricane Michael in the quarter. At least eight brokerages cut their earnings per share estimate for the fourth quarter on Travelers after the California wildfires, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. Insurance claims from the wildfires, including one ranked as the most deadly and destructive in state history, topped $9 billion in December and are expected to grow. In 2017, Travelers began restricting its underwriting of new business in California due to wildfire risk. Travelers is revamping underwriting procedures, including adding tougher inspections, in hopes that it will reduce the amount of risky new properties it insures, said Michael Klein, who heads Travelers’ personal insurance unit. The company is also dropping coverage for some policyholders and is speaking to California’s insurance commissioner about rate increases, Klein said. New York-based Travelers, often seen as a bellwether for the insurance sector, said net written premiums rose 4.2 percent to $6.69 billion. Net investment income rose 5 percent to $630 million, due to higher returns from its fixed income and private equity portfolio business. The company reported a combined ratio of 97.5 percent, compared with 95.5 percent a year earlier. A ratio below 100 percent means the insurer earns more in premiums than it pays out in claims.

On a core basis, the company earned $2.13 per share while analysts were expecting $2.05 per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Total revenue rose 4.6 percent to $7.80 billion. The company has beaten earnings per share estimates in five out of at least eight quarters, including the latest quarter, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.

1.2993358162421764," Insurer Travelers misses profit estimates on storm losses (Reuters) - Travelers Cos Inc, one of the largest U.S. property insurers, reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit on Thursday because of costly damage from wind and hail storms that pounded several U.S. regions in recent months, potentially signaling weak results for other insurers. Catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance, rose 21 percent to $488 million in the second quarter, Travelers said on Thursday. The company’s combined ratio inched up to 98.1 percent, from 96.7 percent a year earlier. A ratio below 100 percent means the insurer earns more in premiums than it pays out in claims. The company’s shares were down 2.3 percent at $127 in opening trade on the New York Stock Exchange. U.S. wind and hail storms are typically challenging for U.S. insurers during the quarter, often tearing apart homeowners’ roofs and pummeling cars in auto dealership lots, and wreaking other havoc that triggers spates of claims. Travelers, which reports earlier that many other large property and casualty insurers, is seen among analysts as a bellwether for the sector. Insurers American International Group Inc and the Allstate Corp, report in early August. Travelers’ quarterly profit was also hurt by a charge of $45 million associated with fire-related commercial losses and an $18 million assessment related to Hurricane Harvey, the insurer said.

-5.553545965970598," Higher catastrophe losses hit Travelers profit, stock off 3 percent (Reuters) - Insurer Travelers Cos Inc's TRV.N quarterly profit missed analysts' estimates on Tuesday, sending its shares down 3.3 percent, due to a rise in catastrophe losses and lower investment income. On a core basis, the New York-based company earned $2.46 per share, missing analysts’ average estimate of $2.68, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Travelers, a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average that is seen as a bellwether for the insurance sector because it typically reports earlier than its competitors, said catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance, widened 2 percent to $354 million in the first quarter. The company blamed winter storms in the eastern United States, a wind and hail storm in the southern United States and deadly January mudslides in Southern California that killed more than 20 people for the rise. The catastrophe losses partly offset the benefits of a more favorable U.S. corporate income tax rate, which spurred a 21.3 percent drop in the insurer’s income tax expenses, and underwriting gains, which rose 22.3 percent to $258 million. Net investment income fell 1 percent to $603 million, due to lower private equity returns compared with a year earlier, the company said. Net written premiums rose 5 percent to $6.82 billion, due in part to rate increases. Last year, many insurers said they had planned to hike rates after suffering steep U.S. catastrophe losses due to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, and wildfires in Southern California. Net income rose to $669 million, or $2.42 per share, in the first quarter ended March 31 from $617 million, or $2.17 per share, a year earlier. The company reported a combined ratio of 95.5 percent, compared with 96 percent a year earlier. A ratio below 100 percent means an insurer earns more in premiums than it pays out in claims. Total revenue rose 5 percent to $7.29 billion. Travelers reported $452 million in after-tax income for its business insurance unit, an increase of 2.3 percent from $442 million during the prior year quarter. Losses in the unit’s workers’ compensation line were lower than expected, but that was offset by losses in the insurer’s commercial automobile line, which were higher than expected, the company said. Travelers shares were down $4.50 at $132.73 on the New York Stock Exchange."
