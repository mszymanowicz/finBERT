-12.417906457695585," Roper Technologies to buy Vertafore for $5.35 billion (Reuters) - Roper Technologies Inc ROP.N said on Thursday it would buy Vertafore Inc, a private equity-owned insurance software vendor, for about $5.35 billion, in what would be its largest takeover deal to date. Reuters had earlier reported that the company was competing with private equity firms in an auction for Vertafore, which is owned by buyout firms Vista Equity Partners and Bain Capital. Acquiring Vertafore would be in line with Roper’s strategy of snapping up software companies in niche markets with strong recurring revenues. It also signals that the highly acquisitive company has not given up on its expansion plans in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has caused some of its customers to review their spending plans. Roper expects Vertafore to contribute about $590 million of revenue and $290 million of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in 2021. Insurance software companies have seen rising demand for products that give customers instant access to their information and help insurance providers cut costs. Vertafore, based in Denver, is one of the primary vendors of software to the property and casualty insurance industry. Vista and Bain acquired the company in 2016 from private equity firm TPG for $2.7 billion, including debt. Roper expects the acquisition to close in the third quarter and be immediately cash accretive. J.P. Morgan and Wells Fargo Securities served as financial advisers to Roper."

-3.488617948132565," Thermo Fisher scraps Roper deal after U.K. antitrust hurdle (Reuters) - Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc and Roper Technologies Inc said on Monday they have mutually agreed to terminate Thermo Fisher’s deal to buy Roper’s unit Gatan Inc owing to challenges in obtaining regulatory approval in the United Kingdom. The $925 million deal, announced last June, attracted the scrutiny of Britain’s competition watchdog, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which launched an in-depth inquiry in January into whether the deal could affect competition. Thermo Fisher, the world’s largest maker of scientific instruments, wanted to strengthen its electron microscopy business with the acquisition of Gatan, which produces highly specialized “peripherals” such as filters and cameras, used in microscopes. The CMA has raised concerns that the deal could enhance Thermo Fisher’s “already strong market position” and that prices of microscopes could go up and quality could suffer. It also noted the merger could hurt competition for certain peripherals. While the deal falling through is disappointing, it is not expected to materially change Thermo Fisher’s capital allocation framework or hit its 2019 earnings per share outlook, Evercore ISI analyst Ross Muken wrote in a research note. “Frankly, they could buy back stock and get a similar level of accretion, or more likely, will continue their focus on tuck-in M&A,” he said. The termination does not affect the existing long-term supply agreement under which Gatan supplies filter systems, cameras and software to Thermo Fisher’s electron microscopy business, the companies said in a statement. Shares of Thermo Fisher and Roper were trading up about 1% in early morning trading."

23.387446376987334," UK competition watchdog puts Thermo Fisher-Roper deal under the microscope (Reuters) - Britain's competition watchdog said on Wednesday Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc's TMO.N $925 million acquisition of Roper Technologies Inc's ROP.N unit Gatan raised concerns that prices of microscopes could go up and quality could suffer. U.S.-based Thermo Fisher - the world’s largest maker of scientific instruments - said in June it would buy Gatan, a Pleasanton, California-based maker of instruments and software used to enhance the performance of electron microscopes. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said the deal could affect two rivals of Thermo Fisher who use Gatan products with their electron microscopes. “The CMA is concerned that the proposed deal could allow Thermo Fisher to weaken its competitors, enhancing its own already strong market position, and lead to higher prices for customers using electron microscopes,” the watchdog said in a statement. Thermo Fisher said in June that Gatan, which is part of Roper’s medical and scientific imaging unit, was expected to generate about $150 million in revenue in 2018. “Both parties continue to work cooperatively with the CMA through the review process. All other regulatory approval conditions have been satisfied,” Waltham, Massachusetts-based Thermo Fisher said on Wednesday. (For a graphic on 'Thermo Fisher buoyed by Gatan deal' click tmsnrt.rs/2A7MFP8) CMA was also concerned that the merger would leave Thermo Fisher with insufficient competition in the market for direct detection cameras. The watchdog said the merger would be referred for an in-depth Phase 2 investigation if the firms did not address its concerns. Thermo Fisher, which employs 70,000 people globally, is involved in life sciences research, diagnostics and laboratory products and services. The firm reported a better-than-expected third-quarter profit in October on higher demand for its laboratory products and raised its full-year forecast.
