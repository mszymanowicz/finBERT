17.947702060221875," UPDATE 2-Flight simulator maker CAE's profit halves as pandemic weighs on demand (Adds CEO comment from conference call with analysts) Feb 12 (Reuters) - Canada’s CAE Inc on Friday reported a 50% drop in third-quarter profit, as pandemic-battered air travel weighed on demand for the company’s full-flight simulators and pilot training. CAE, which produces flight simulators for planemakers Boeing Co and Airbus, however, expects to see an uptick in training contracts as more people get vaccinated and resume air travel. CAE Chief Executive Marc Parent told analysts the company is ramping up training for Boeing’s 737 MAX as the jet returns to the skies in the United States and other countries after a near two-year grounding. CAE has sold 53 MAX simulators and delivered 41 to date, including five in the company’s network, he said. The world’s largest civil aviation training specialist said its net income attributable to shareholders fell to C$48.8 million ($38.3 million), or 18 Canadian cents per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, from C$97.7 million, or 37 Canadian cents per share, a year earlier. Montreal-based CAE said deliveries of flight simulators fell to 10 units in the third quarter, from 12 units a year earlier. Revenue fell to C$832.4 million from C$923.5 million in the year-ago period. CAE stock was down 1% at C$32.12 a share in afternoon trading in Toronto.

10.879930645860417," CAE reports positive cash flow, adjusted profit as training rebounds (Reuters) - Canada's CAE Inc CAE.TO on Tuesday reported positive cash flow and earned a surprise adjusted quarterly profit, as client usage of its civil aviation training centers rebounded since the start of COVID-19, lifting shares as much as 7.4%. Montreal-based CAE expects a stronger second half of the fiscal year, compared with the first, and to generate positive free cash flow for the full year. CAE, the world’s largest civil aviation training specialist, sees opportunities with the now-grounded Boeing 737 MAX when the jet resumes flying. Reuters reported on Monday that the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) is set to lift its grounding order on the plane as early as Nov 18. “With regards to MAX orders, we are booking them now,” CAE Chief Executive Marc Parent told reporters. “The lion’s share of the simulators for the MAX have been won by CAE, and I suspect we are going to continue to do well there.” CAE said civil training center utilization more than doubled since the low point of the first quarter, driven by business aviation. But deliveries of flight simulators fell to 10 units in the quarter from 18 units a year earlier, as COVID-19 hit demand. CAE expects 35 to 40 civil simulator deliveries this fiscal year. Demand for CAE's simulators is linked to new aircraft deliveries by plane makers Boeing Co BA.N and Airbus AIR.PA, which are seeing lower sales amid a slump in air travel. CAE reported free cash flow of C$44.9 million ($34.5 million) for the second quarter ended Sept. 30, and an adjusted profit of C$34.2 million. Including C$51.1 million in restructuring costs, the company would have recorded a quarterly loss. The stock was up 5.23% by early afternoon. On an adjusted basis, CAE earned 13 Canadian cents per share in the quarter, beating analysts’ expectation of a loss of 2 Canadian cents per share, according to IBES data from Refinitiv."

34.55657492354739," Canada's CAE in talks with airlines to win more pilot training business (Reuters) - CAE Inc CAE.TO said on Wednesday it is in advanced discussions with airlines about doing more training of their pilots after the company reported a bigger than expected quarterly loss due to COVID-19. The world’s largest civil aviation training company is cutting costs and counting on the easing of travel restrictions to bolster demand for pilot-training services. Revenues from civil training, CAE’s largest business unit, dropped due to travel restrictions and lower customer demand during the quarter ended June 30, with a center utilization rate averaging 33% compared with 76% during the same three months a year earlier. Chief Executive Marc Parent told analysts he sees opportunities to win outsourced training business from airlines, which are struggling to conserve cash. “We’re currently in advanced discussions with a number of airline customers to potentially do more for them,” he said. Montreal-based CAE said deliveries of flight simulators declined on an annual basis from five to two units during the quarter. CAE would make most of its anticipated 35-40 simulator deliveries during the back half of its fiscal year. Demand for CAE's flight simulators is linked to new aircraft deliveries by planemakers Boeing Co BA.N and Airbus AIR.PA, which are seeing lower jet sales. CAE expects to cut about C$100 million in costs over the next 12 months to yield C$50 million in annual savings. The company swung to a net quarterly loss of C$110.6 million ($83.36 million), or 42 Canadian cents per share, compared with a profit of C$61.5 million a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, CAE lost 11 Canadian cents per share in the quarter, while its revenue declined 33.3% to C$550.5 million, compared with analysts estimates of a quarterly loss of 6 Canadian cents per share, according to IBES estimates from Refinitiv.

7.300884955752214," Canada's CAE profit plunges on lower flight simulator sales (Reuters) - Civil aviation training company CAE Inc CAE.TO on Friday reported a 35.8% fall in quarterly profit, hurt by a slump in training revenue in March due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Canadian company warned of a significant impact in the short term. The COVID-19 crisis has roiled the global travel sector, with air travel demand in U.S. alone down by about 95% as state-wide lockdown measures led to a rise in ticket cancellations and decline in traffic. “In March, approximately one-third of Civil training locations worldwide suspended operations, and several of those remaining open, operated at significantly reduced capacity,” the company said. Montreal-based CAE, the world’s largest civil aviation training company, said revenue in its civil aviation unit grew just 1.4% in the fourth quarter ended March 31. Net income attributable to shareholders fell to C$78.4 million ($55.9 million), or 29 Canadian cents per share, in the quarter, from C$122.3 million, or 46 Canadian cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue fell to C$977.3 million from C$1.02 billion. Analysts on average had expected earnings of 41 Canadian cents per share and revenue of C$1.04 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv."
-1.1881188118811863," UPDATE 2-Canadian flight trainer CAE recalls 1,500 employees, builds ventilators (Adds context on ventilators) April 20 (Reuters) - Training specialist CAE said on Monday it would recall 1,500 furloughed employees and had signed a contract with Canada to make 10,000 ventilators in response to the coronavirus pandemic. Governments around the world are turning to industry to boost the number of available mechanical breathing devices that can supply air and oxygen, crucial for the care of people who suffer lung failure, which can be a complication of COVID-19. Companies like Europe’s Airbus SE and U.S. automaker General Motors Co are building ventilators while Canadian plane and train maker Bombardier will help medical company O-Two Medical Technologies produce the equipment in Canada’s province of Ontario. Montreal-based CAE, which specializes in civil aviation training, and manufactures full-flight simulators, said it expects the ventilators will start being delivered in early May to health authorities for certification. The training specialist, which also provides medical simulation training products, said it is also bringing Canadian employees back as part of a government wage subsidy program that helps put workers back on payroll. The Canadian government on April 11 approved a wage subsidy program, known as the Canada Emergency Wage Subsidy (CEWS), which would cover up to 75% of workers’ wages for businesses that have suffered due to the pandemic. CAE Chief Executive Officer Marc Parent said the wage subsidy program will allow Canadian industry to put staff back on payroll and be “better positioned to rebound when the current challenges have passed”. The aviation industry has been hard-hit by the coronavirus pandemic which has led to cancellation of flights and grounded aircraft worldwide. The majority of the recalled employees are based in Montreal and will work from home. Earlier this month, the company said it would furlough 2,600 of its 10,500 employees, freeze salaries and place some of its employees on a reduced work week to cut costs.

CAE said it was placing 900 employees on a reduced work week and reducing salaries for employees not affected by the shortened work weeks. The Montreal-based company also suspended its dividend and share repurchase plan. “Taking decisive yet flexible action will help to protect our people and operations over the short-term and gives us the necessary agility to resume long-term growth when global air travel returns,” Chief Executive Officer Marc Parent said.

-50.539462574093065," CAE beats on profit on training demand, inks 737 MAX simulator sales MONTREAL (Reuters) - Canada's CAE Inc CAE.TO, the world's largest civil aviation training company, on Friday reported a better-than-expected profit, driven by strength in its commercial pilot training and simulators business. CAE is making deals to train pilots for airlines like easyjet Plc EZJ.L as air traffic rises. Both CAE and U.S.-based Textron Inc's TXT.N TRU training division are also seeing increased demand for 737 MAX full flight simulators, after Boeing Co BA.N recently recommended that pilots train in a simulator for the model. The 737 MAX, which was grounded in March following two crashes involving the type, is being fixed by the planemaker. “There has been a step up in demand,” Chief Executive Marc Parent told analysts, although he stressed that it was up to regulators to finalize pilot training for the aircraft. As thousands of pilots from more than 54 airlines need training, Boeing estimates that 36 737 MAX simulators are in service, driving demand. To date, CAE has sold 56 MAX simulators to airlines, and has delivered 22 as of December, Parent said. Since January, six of the company’s seven full flight simulator orders were for the 737 MAX. CAE is “in the process of deploying more” simulators in its training network, above the three already in service. With limited 737 MAX simulator capacity in Europe, Parent said “it’s reasonable to expect that one would go there,” without elaborating. Parent also said CAE had to pull about 20 workers out of China and had some customers who were forced to cancel their training because of the coronavirus outbreak, although he added that any impact would be contained. Revenue in CAE’s civil aviation training business jumped about 22% to C$558.1 million in the third quarter ended Dec. 31. CAE reaffirmed its full-year outlook for 30% growth in operating income in the civil aviation training business. Montreal-based CAE said net income attributable to shareholders rose 26% to C$97.7 million ($73.4 million), or 37 Canadian cents per share, in the quarter. Revenue rose 13% to C$923.5 million. Analysts on average had expected quarterly earnings of 35 Canadian cents per share and revenue of C$939.7 million, according to IBES data from Refinitiv."

6.105163458617488," Canada's CAE sees strong pilot training demand when Boeing MAX jets fly (Reuters) - CAE Inc CAE.TO expects strong demand from airlines for pilot training when Boeing Co's BA.N grounded 737 MAX jets are cleared to fly, Chief Executive Marc Parent told analysts on Wednesday, after the Canadian training specialist reported lower-than-expected quarterly earnings. CAE, the world’s largest civil aviation training company, reported higher costs and a near 30% fall in quarterly operating income from its second-largest defense and security business, but said its full-year outlook for fiscal 2020 remains on track. The shares fell as much as 14% but pared losses to end down 4.6% at C$34.17, giving it a market value of C$9.1 billion ($6.8 billion). The Montreal-based company, which offers health care and military aircraft training, also sees demand from carriers as air traffic rises and the supply of commercial pilots remains limited. Boeing's 737 MAX has been grounded since March following two fatal accidents. Southwest Airlines Co LUV.N and Air Canada AC.TO have removed the plane from their schedules until January 2020, but there is no firm date for MAX to resume flights. “Clearly there is going to be a lot of training to be done when the aircraft are cleared so I would see pent up demand there when the airlines start to fly,” Parent said. CAE recorded 47 sales of 737 MAX simulators, with 11 delivered and another 11 to be delivered by December. MAX simulator sales are driven by plane orders, Parent said, adding that demand was not unusual. CAE said costs rose with the company’s selling, general and administrative expenses up 10% and finance expenses doubling. CAE reported a weaker-than-expected negative free cash flow of C$102.1 million, compared with an estimated negative cash flow of C$11 million, according to four analysts polled by Refinitiv. But Chief Financial Officer Sonya Branco said free cash flow was impacted by simulator deliveries, which are under production for delivery later in the year. CAE delivered five simulators during the quarter compared with 12 during the same period last year. “We expect those to be delivered over the next three quarters, so really, it’s just a question of timing,” she said. CAE’s revenue rose 14% to C$825.6 million, but fell short of analysts’ expectations of C$845.96 million. Net income attributable to shareholders fell 11.4% to C$61.5 million ($46.26 million), or 23 Canadian cents per share, in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 ended June 30. Analysts on an average had expected 28 Canadian cents per share. The company raised its quarterly dividend by 10% to 11 Canadian cents per share."

3.8140238042187184," Canada's CAE sees surge in global demand for pilots in next decade Oct 16 (Reuters) - Aviation training firm CAE Inc said on Tuesday it expects global demand for pilots to rise with fleet growth and changing crew ratios, and the active combined airline and business jet pilot population will exceed half a million by 2028. A positive environment combined with strong passenger traffic, strong fleet growth and aircraft utilization drive solid performance in business and commercial market aviation segments, CAE said. The 10-year average compound annual growth rate (CAGR) for commercial aircraft is 3.5 percent, and the active fleet is expected to grow by 12,000 aircraft to reach 39,000 aircraft by 2028, the company said. The growth in fleet and crew ratio is driving the need for 10,000 new business jet pilots and 160,000 new airline pilots in the next decade, CAE said. Crew ratios are projected to increase to an average of more than 12 pilots per aircraft in the next decade, it said. It is the first time CAE is adding business jet pilots to its outlook and the forecast comes on the opening day of the world’s largest business jet show in Orlando.
