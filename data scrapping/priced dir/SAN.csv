21.725239616613422," UPDATE 3-Santander bets on rapid recovery after first ever loss * Record 2020 loss of 8.77 bln euros on COVID-19 provisions * Q4 net profit falls 90% y/y to 277 mln; forecast 411 mln * Sees 2021 underlying ROTE improving to 9-10% * Will pay 0.0275 euros in cash dividend against 2020 (Recasts with Santander comments, shares) MADRID, Feb 3 (Reuters) - Spain’s Santander is betting on a vaccine-driven economic recovery in 2021 after the euro zone’s second-biggest bank plunged to its first ever annual loss last year. The lender said it expected its underlying return on tangible equity (ROTE), a key measure of profitability, to recover to 9-10% this year from 7.44% at the end of 2020. A recent improvement in loan payments by customers also led it to estimate a lower cost of insuring loans for 2021. Bad loan provisions, as customers struggled to make repayments in the COVID-19 pandemic, were a factor in the 2020 loss, although it was mainly due to hefty writedowns on previous acquisitions. “A successful roll out of the vaccine will act as a strong catalyst for an economic recovery”, Chairwoman Ana Botin said in a statement, citing an International Monetary Fund report last month that raised its 2021 global growth forecast. For the fourth quarter of 2020, however, Santander’s net profit slumped 90% to 277 million euros as it racked up hundreds of millions of euros in costs to pay for job cuts and branch closures as part of its restructuring plan, mainly in Spain. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a profit of 411 million. Banks across Europe are struggling to cope with record low interest rates, and the economic downturn sparked by the pandemic is forcing them to cut costs. For the whole of 2020, Santander booked a loss of 8.77 billion euros after 12.6 billion in one-off charges in the second quarter. Analysts had expected a loss of 8.64 billion. Santander’s core markets, spanning Brazil to Spain, have been some of the hardest hit by the pandemic, with weaker emerging market currencies exacerbating the pain. However, fourth quarter net interest income (NII), a measure of earnings on loans minus deposit costs, rose 3.2% from the previous quarter to 8.02 billion euros, above analysts’ forecasts of 7.79 billion euros. Shares in Santander rose around 1.6% after gaining almost 5% on Tuesday, outperforming Spain's benchmark index .IBEX-35. Citi welcomed the better news on lending income and fees that supported fourth-quarter results, excluding the restructuring costs, and highlighted the bullish 2021 guidance. JP Morgan said Santander’s 2021 cost income ratio target of less than 47%, as well as its profitability and credit risk targets, should translate into net income of 6.2 billion euros. Santander said it intended to pay a cash dividend of 0.0275 euros per share, down from an original plan of 0.1 euros, to bring its payout policy within the limits set by the European Central Bank (ECB) in December. The bank added it intended to resume payments closer to previous levels in 2021, once the ECB removes its limitations, and restore a dividend of 40-50% of underlying profit, in cash, in the medium term. The limited payout allowed Santander to improve its core tier-1 fully loaded capital ratio (CET-1), the strictest measure of solvency, to 11.89% from 11.57% in September, taking into account new accounting standards. The bank said it was aiming for a CET-1 ratio of 11-12% and underlying ROTE of 13-15% over the medium term."
25.581395348837212," UBS not in any talks on Orcel's deferred pay: chairman MILAN (Reuters) - UBS is not involved in any discussions over Italian banker Andrea Orcel’s 55 million euro ($67 million) deferred pay package forfeited when he left the Swiss bank to join Santander, the UBS chairman said on Thursday. Orcel left UBS in 2018 to become the chief executive of Santander. But the Spanish bank withdrew its proposal after disagreements over Orcel’s pay. Before that, it had promised to pay up to 35 million euros of Orcel’s deferred compensation. Orcel is now seeking 112 million euros in a lawsuit against Santander which he is expected to resolve before taking the helm at UniCredit. Italy’s second biggest bank on Wednesday said it would appoint Orcel, 57, as its next chief executive in April. UBS chairman Axel Weber, speaking to Bloomberg Television, said UBS’s rules stated clearly that deferred pay would be lost if staff left the bank. “We have a very clear policy which can be summarised in two words, it’s ‘leave, lose’”. “If executives take another turn in their career and join another organisation, it’s their decision,” he said when asked if UBS would show any flexibility on Orcel’s deferred compensation. “It has no implications for us so we’re not in any part of the discussions on this, we have a clear policy which we have communicated throughout,” he added. A source with knowledge of the matter told Reuters on Wednesday Orcel was open to negotiating a settlement with Santander and would be ready to almost halve his claims to 60 million euros.

12.94498381877024," UPDATE 4-UniCredit set to appoint Andrea Orcel as CEO - source * Board to discuss appointment at meeting on Wednesday * UniCredit had been discussing possible MPS deal * Treasury official says Orcel ‘well regarded’ in Rome (Adds Santander, Orcel lawyer on lawsuit) MILAN, Jan 26 (Reuters) - UniCredit is set to name Andrea Orcel as chief executive, a person familiar with the matter said on Tuesday, putting one of Europe’s best-known dealmakers at the helm just as the coronavirus crisis is pushing banks to merge. Orcel’s nomination would mark a return to the top tier of finance for the Italian, who left his senior investment banking role at UBS in 2018 to run Santander, only for the Spanish bank to rescind the offer in a row over pay. The appointment, which has not been confirmed and will be discussed at a board meeting on Wednesday, comes at a crucial time for UniCredit, which has been talking to the Italian government about possibly buying state-owned Monte dei Paschi . After rescuing the bank in 2017, Italy must now privatise it and the search for a buyer has become a matter of urgency after the Tuscan lender was given until Jan. 31 to tell the European Central Bank how it plans to plug a capital shortfall. Italy is hoping to reach an agreement on what to do with Monte dei Paschi (MPS) by April, sources have said. Shares in UniCredit, Italy’s second-biggest bank, rose 4.5% following reports of Orcel’s nomination, outperforming a 2% rise in the country’s banking stock index. A spokesman for UniCredit did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the potential appointment. Orcel could not immediately be reached for comment. Orcel, 57, emerged as a strong contender in the race to replace UniCredit’s Jean Pierre Mustier thanks to backing from some of the bank’s international investors and a group of local shareholders led by eyewear magnate Leonardo Del Vecchio. Mustier, also a former investment banker, said on Nov. 30 he would leave by April at the latest citing disagreements with the bank’s board over strategy. The Frenchman, who had prioritised returning cash to shareholders over acquisitions, had set strict terms for considering any MPS transaction. ‘WELL REGARDED’ Orcel is well-known at MPS as he advised it to buy Banca Antonveneta for 9 billion euros ($11 billion) in 2007 when he was at Merrill Lynch. The deal stretched the bank’s finances on the eve of the financial crisis and contributed to its demise. Two people close to its privatisation process said Orcel was a dealmaker at heart and would weigh the pros and cons of any potential deal. An Italian Treasury official told Reuters the banker from Rome was “well known and well regarded” inside the ministry and it was open to discussing the MPS deal with the next UniCredit CEO, whoever that might be. Del Vecchio’s backing of Orcel has fuelled speculation in financial circles that he may have more ambitious deals in mind than MPS if he becomes UniCredit CEO - such as a tie-up with Mediobanca. Del Vecchio is the single biggest investor in Mediobanca, has a stake in UniCredit, and is seen as a prominent figure in Italian finance. Earlier in his investment banking career, Orcel also worked on the 1998 merger from which UniCredit was first born. The head of investment banking at Swiss bank UBS from 2012 to 2018, Orcel was due to crown his dream of becoming a banking chief executive by taking the helm at Santander. But the Spanish lender withdrew its offer after disagreements over Orcel’s compensation, leaving him unemployed and prompting the Italian to file a 112 million euro lawsuit. It was not clear what would happen to the Santander lawsuit if Orcel were to join UniCredit. Santander declined to comment on the lawsuit and Orcel’s lawyer did not respond to phone calls requesting comment. People familiar with the search process had said Orcel’s background in investment banking, like Mustier’s, had raised doubts about his suitability, as had the Santander lawsuit. While running UniCredit would fulfil Orcel’s long-held ambition to become a CEO, it would probably be at a fraction of the salary he earned as an investment banker or the package he was eyeing at Santander. With an annual salary including a bonus of 10 million euros, a sign-on bonus of 17 million euros and deferred compensation in the form of shares, Orcel would have become the highest-paid bank CEO in the euro zone if he had joined Santander. Even before Mustier took a 75% pay cut last year due to the coronavirus pandemic he was one of the lowest paid bank CEOs in Europe, earning 1.2 million euros in 2019."

The cuts equate to about 12% of Santander’s workforce in its home market and nearly a third of its branches. A further 1,500 workers will be transferred to other positions within the company, Santander said. Hit by the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic, ultra-low interest rates in the euro zone and a shift by customers towards online banking, Spanish lenders have been looking to rein in excess costs.

In a separate statement, Banco Santander said it had agreed to acquire several highly specialised technological assets from the merchant payments business of Wirecard in Europe, to accelerate its growth plans in Europe. The acquisition does not include Wirecard companies and Santander will not assume any legal liability relating to Wirecard AG and Wirecard Bank AG or its past actions, Santander said. The deal is expected to be completed by the end of the year and is subject to certain conditions, including regulatory approvals. Around 500 Wirecard employees will join Santander, the Spanish lender said. Most employees currently managing the acquired assets will become part of Santander’s global merchant services team. This also applies to the majority of employees of Wirecard Bank AG. A source familiar with the matter said Santander had agreed to pay around 100 million euros for those assets. Currently, investor processes are still underway for the sale of other Wirecard subsidiaries in Asia, South Africa and Turkey, Jaffe said, adding that assets from subsidiaries in Brazil, Romania and North America have already been sold. Results are expected within the next weeks, Jaffe said."
27.71535580524345," Santander plans to cut 14% of jobs, third of branches in Spain: sources MADRID (Reuters) - Spanish lenders, including Santander SAN.MC, are increasing cost-cutting measures to cope with the economic impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, ultra-low interest rates in the euro zone and a shift by customers towards online banking. On Friday, two sources with knowledge of the matter said that Santander was planning to cut 4,000 jobs, or around 14% of its total workforce in its home market, and close up to 1,000 branches, around 32% of its branch offices in Spain. At the end of September, the bank had 28,797 employees, including at its company headquarters on the outskirts of Madrid, and 3,110 branches across the country. The sources said another 1,000 staff would move on to different jobs within its Spanish branches. Santander declined to comment. Though the number of branches since the financial crisis in 2008 has nearly halved, Spain is one of the countries with the highest number of branches per 100,000 adults in the world, at nearly 50, according to the International Monetary Fund. Banks across Europe have been deepening cost cuts on stand-alone basis or through tie-ups. Caixabank's CABK.MC agreed 4.3 billion euro ($5.08 billion) acquisition of its rival Bankia BKIA.MC is also expected to lead to thousands of job cuts. Pressure from ultra low interest rates and a change in consumer habits is also driving changes in the industry. At Santander, almost half the sales during 2020 have been done on digital channels, a trend which has been accelerated by the pandemic. According to one of the sources, in two years transactions done in branches could halve. At the end of October, Santander earmarked an extra 1 billion euros in cost savings in Europe by 2022, and said it was planning to reduce staff in Spain, Portugal, Britain and Poland.. That was on top of 1 billion euros in savings the group was planning in Europe by 2020. Among other Spanish lenders, Sabadell SABE.MC, the country's fifth-biggest in terms of assets, is planning to reduce costs at home, while speeding up a cost-cutting plan at its British arm TSB."
46.50000000000001," Santander signals worst may be over after solid third quarter MADRID (Reuters) - Santander SAN.MC rebounded strongly in the third quarter from a record second-quarter loss and tentatively signalled that the worst of the crisis may be over as loan repayment rates improved and cost cuts took effect. Spain’s largest bank said it now expects to book an underlying profit of around 5 billion euros ($5.9 billion) for 2020, sending its shares up more than 4% in early trade. By 1335 GMT they were still 1.8% higher versus a broader fall in the Madrid index. “Despite the uncertainty of the ‘second wave’, today we have better visibility than we did back in April,” Chairman Ana Botin said. Banks across Europe are struggling to cope with record low interest rates, and the economic downturn sparked by the coronavirus pandemic is forcing a focus on further cost cuts, including through tie-ups. But Santander’s Chief Executive Jose Antonio Alvarez told analysts that the bank was not interested in acquisitions. The lender said cost savings still had some way to go, pencilling in an extra 1 billion euros of cuts in Europe by 2022 which could include thousands of job losses. That is on top of 1 billion euros in savings the group was planning in Europe by 2020, a target initially set out for the mid-term. Broker Jefferies said key countries like Brazil, the bank’s consumer business and the UK all came in ahead of expectations, though Spain was a 3% miss in terms of net profit. Santander’s statutory net profit trebled in the period from a year ago, but on an underlying basis profit fell 18% to 1.75 billion euros due to coronavirus-related provisions. That was still well above analysts’ estimates of 1.06 billion euros The bank will however not be able to finish 2020 with a statutory profit after 12 billion euros in writedowns on previous acquisitions in the second quarter. This did not have an impact on capital, which rose to 11.57% from 11.46% in June, taking into account new accounting standards. Spanish newspaper Expansion reported on Tuesday that Santander was planning around 3,000 job cuts, around 11% of its workforce in Spain, due to the impact of the virus and a customer shift towards digital channels. CEO Alvarez said there would be job losses in Spain, Portugal, Britain and Poland. He added that he would not talk about staff cut numbers before discussing this with unions. Among the efficiency gains, Botin said Santander would build a global digital consumer lending business on the back of Santander Consumer Finance and its online digital platform Openbank, while also combining the bank’s different payments businesses into a single autonomous company. Santander’s core markets, spanning Brazil to Spain, have been some of the hardest hit by the pandemic, with weaker emerging market currencies exacerbating the pain. But an improvement in loan payments by customers led the bank to estimate a lower cost of insuring its loans for 2020. Santander lowered its guidance for cost of risk, which measures the cost of managing credit risks and potential losses, to 130 basis points by the end of 2020 from between 140 bps and 150 bps previously, implying lower loan-loss provisions in the future. Botin also said the cost of risk could stabilise or even fall next year. Shareholders on Tuesday approved a scrip dividend payable in new shares equivalent to 10 cents per share for 2019, and signed off on a 0.10 euros per share cash dividend to be paid in 2021, pending a green light from the European Central Bank."

69.69696969696969," Blackstone offers sweetener as tries to sell $1.2 billion of Spanish properties (This October 6 story corrects date of Santander buying Banco Popular to 2017 from 2016; removes name of spokesman) MADRID (Reuters) - Investment giant Blackstone BX.N is offering a sweetener to buyers as it tries to speed up the sale of 8,400 properties in Spain in the teeth of the country's deepest recession on record. Two Blackstone units, Aliseda and Anticipa, said on Tuesday they would reimburse buyers up to one tenth of the sale price if their property dropped more than a tenth in value in the three months after a deal is sealed. “We detected the current context was generating uncertainty for buyers, and wanted to provide them with security and send a message of confidence in the Spanish real estate market,” said an Aliseda spokesman. Blackstone bought the real estate portfolio, known as “Quasar”, in August 2017 from Santander, Spain’s biggest lender, which had acquired Quasar following the collapse of its previous owner Banco Popular earlier that year. Aliseda took control of the portfolio and placed it on sale in 2018, but many properties remain on the market as the COVID-19 pandemic plunges Spain into a deep recession. The portfolio being advertised is valued at 1.035 billion euros ($1.22 billion), with 640 million being handled by Aliseda, which is selling 5,700 properties. Hola Pisos - Anticipa’s commercial outfit - is selling 2,700 properties, valued at 395 million. To decide whether a buyer qualifies for the 10% reimbursement, Blackstone will consult the price index compiled by Spain’s infrastructure ministry for each province. Aliseda’s spokesman said the offer did not imply a prediction prices would fall in coming months, and that his company did not make forecasts. There are, however, signs that Spain’s economic paralysis has hurt real estate. The presence of funds as major property owners in Spain is politically controversial, with the current administration decreeing in March a four-month moratorium on rent for tenants whose landlords owned eight or more properties.

56.77083333333333," UPDATE 1-Santander to seek shareholder approval for cash dividend (Adds details) MADRID, Sept 21 (Reuters) - Santander on Monday called a general shareholders’ meeting on October 27 to approve a 0.10 euros per share cash dividend to be paid in 2021, pending a green light from the European Central Bank. Santander, the euro zone’s third-biggest bank by market value, had in July proposed a scrip dividend, payable in new shares, equivalent to 10 cents per share for 2019. This followed the ECB’s recommendation that euro zone banks should not pay cash dividends until the end of 2020 to help them to cope with the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic. But the ECB will in December revisit its recommendation for euro zone banks not to pay dividends and may move to a more flexible, case-by-case approach. The total payment corresponding to 2019 would be equivalent to 0.20 euros per share, Santander said on Monday. In April, following the ECB’s initial recommendation that European banks should refrain from paying dividends against 2019 and 2020 results, Santander decided to cancel payment of the 2019 final dividend and suspend the dividend policy for 2020. On July 29, Santander had announced its intention to apply a 100% cash dividend policy, subject to regulatory approvals and improvement in market conditions. On Monday, the bank said its dividend policy was also conditional upon the group’s core capital tier-1 ratio remaining within or above its target range of 11-12% after distribution, and the total amount to be paid not exceeding 50% of the bank’s 2020 consolidated underlying profit. At the end of June, Santander’s core tier-1 capital ratio rose to 11.46% from 11.33% three months earlier with the full implementation of new accounting standards. The bank also said its board had decided to relocate the October shareholders meeting from Santander in northern Spain to Boadilla del Monte on the outskirts of Madrid to reduce the need for travel and to safeguard those organising and attending the event.

45.58139534883721," Santander job row with Orcel set for court showdown with Botin a witness MADRID (Reuters) - A high-profile row between Spain’s Santander and Andrea Orcel will go to a court showdown in March after they failed to reach a deal over the withdrawal of an offer to make the Italian banker chief executive. Orcel, among Europe’s top investment bankers, is claiming breach of contract by the euro zone’s third-largest bank by market value, and suing for 112 million euros ($126 million). He was offered the role of CEO in September 2018 but Santander changed its mind the next January, saying it could not meet his pay demands, in a rare U-turn involving such a high-level appointment at a major bank. Lawyers for both parties, wearing masks to respect COVID-19 rules, told a preliminary hearing in a Madrid court that they did not want an out-of-court settlement. As a result, the judge said the dispute would now go to trial starting on March 10 next year, when Santander chairman Ana Botin will be among the witnesses called to speak, at the request of Orcel’s legal team. Axel Weber, chairman of UBS was also added to the list of witnesses. UBS declined to comment. Jose Miguel Fatas, a lawyer for Santander, said it had not asked for Orcel be put on the list of witnesses because what was at stake was not the facts but legal issues and the Italian would not therefore speak at the trial. “Our thesis is very simple, there is an offer letter that they say is the (job) contract and we say that it is not the contract,” Fatas told reporters after the one-hour hearing. Orcel’s lawyer Alvaro Remon, who did not respond to a request for comment, had earlier told the court: “What we ask for first of all is that the contract be fulfilled.” Much of the trial will revolve around whether a September, 2018 four-page offer letter was a binding job contract, as Orcel says, or a non-binding initial offer, as the bank says. “How much meaning can be attached to those two words: recruitment and appointment. And that’s all I’m saying”, judge Javier Sanchez Beltran told the court. Santander promised to pay “up to” 35 million euros of a 55 million euro package that Orcel was due to receive in future years from his employer at the time, UBS. The letter said Orcel would make his “best efforts” to cap that cost by getting the Swiss bank to contribute some of it. However, UBS refused and Orcel then told Santander he would not accept less than 35 million euros. Orcel, who was head of UBS Group’s investment banking business at the time, resigned from the Swiss bank when he was offered the Santander job. Neither Orcel nor Botin were in court for Monday’s hearing, which wrapped up after focusing on issues such as procedural evidence and which witnesses would be accepted."

-17.64705882352941," Spain's Santander books record $13 billion loss on COVID-19 impairments MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's Santander SAN.MC reported a record net loss of 11.1 billion euros (10.08 billion pounds) in the second quarter, taking the biggest hit yet for a European bank dealing with the coronavirus crisis which it tried to offset with lower costs. The euro zone’s second-biggest bank by market value said on Wednesday it had booked one-off charges worth 12.6 billion euros as the economic deterioration caused by the COVID-19 pandemic forced it to writedown previous acquisitions, mainly in Europe. Santander’s core markets spanning Brazil to Spain have been some of the hardest hit by the pandemic, with weaker emerging market currencies exacerbating the pain. Of the total impairments, 10.1 billion euros are related to goodwill and 2.5 billion euros to DTAs, an instrument that grants tax breaks to companies when reporting losses or against certain provisions. The bank said impairments would have no impact on its capital levels, which rose to 11.46% in June from 11.33% in March with the full implementation of new accounting standards. Santander reiterated its guidance for cost of risk, a measure of the cost of insuring its loan book, at between 130 basis points and 150 basis points by the end of 2020 after it rose in June to 126 basis points. It was 100 bps in March. Excluding one-offs, underlying attributable profit fell 27% to 1.53 billion euros against the same quarter a year ago. Shares in Santander were down 3.5% by 0740 GMT, the worst performer on Spain's Ibex-35 index .IBEX which was down 0.4%. Analysts at UBS said the cost performance was better than expected but called the results “a messy set of numbers”, confirming the negative direction for revenues in most units and the likely rise of loan loss provisions in the second half. Santander said the group was ahead of its cost savings plan, with operating expenses down 5% year on year in real terms and the European region achieving more than 300 million euros in costs efficiencies in the first half, 75% of the 2020 target. Net interest income, a measure of earnings on loans minus deposit costs, fell 14% to 7.72 billion euros due to pressure from low interest rates, while revenues fell 15% to 10.46 billion euros. Analysts polled by Reuters expected net interest income at 7.75 billion euros and revenues at 10.56 billion euros. The COVID-19 related impairments hit return on tangible equity ratio (ROTE), a measure of profitability, which stood at 5.19% at the end of June. Santander Chairman Ana Botin said the bank was committed to raising its ROTE to 13%-15% in the medium term and would provide an update on its strategic plans in the coming months. Santander said it was proposing a scrip dividend, payable in new shares, this year equivalent to 10 cents per share for 2019, after the European Central Bank’s recommended euro zone banks did not pay cash dividends until the end of 2020. The bank said its board intended to resume paying a full cash dividend as “soon as market conditions normalise, subject to regulatory approvals and guidance.”"
-19.433198380566807," Santander Chairman says EU aid agreement paves way for cross-border mergers MADRID (Reuters) - The European leaders' agreement on a massive stimulus plan for their coronavirus battered economies should help kick-start cross-border consolidation in Europe and complete the European banking union, Santander SAN.MC Chairman Ana Botin said. “What was agreed yesterday (in the early hours of Tuesday) means the opportunity and the probability that we do get a banking union and cross-border consolidation is much higher,” Botin told Reuters in a Zoom call. “It will require changes, but I think those changes are much more likely today than they were yesterday,” Ana Botin said. Santander is the euro zone’s second-biggest lender in terms of market value. Remarks by Botin echoed comments from European Central Bank vice-president Luis de Guindos, who on Monday said that he expected banks to engage in both national and cross-border consolidation within weeks or months. Consolidation is seen as inevitable among banks in the euro zone to gain scale, but low valuations and different legal frameworks around countries are hampering any such transactions. Profitability across the euro zone bank sector is low and an economic recession in the region is expected to further dampen the banks’ prospects, partly due to also higher loan-loss provisions related to the impact from COVID-19 outbreak. “What has happened yesterday on the agreement in Europe is a clear stepping stone for the banking union in Europe. And banking union and free transfer of euros across countries is a pre-requisite for cross-border euro mergers and consolidation,” Botin said. “I do think it’s the time. I do think European banks need scale,” Botin said, adding that for now Santander was not interested in taking part. “As of today, no, with the current rules, no. When the rules change who knows. Even then I think there are others who are more likely to be ahead of us,” she said. The agreement between EU leaders paved the way for the European Commission to raise billions of euros on capital markets on behalf of all 27 states, an unprecedented act of solidarity in almost seven decades of European integration. “It is really important for Europe, I think it is a game changer, this is really a turn in the road, in the right direction,” Botin said, adding that this “will be seen in time as key step in the construction of Europe.” Botin also that the agreement had diminished and averted the chances a sovereign risk and fragmentation problem in Europe and that the person, the country, who had taken the lead to make this possible was (Chancellor Angela) Merkel and Germany. “We could have hoped for something bigger but not for something better,” she said."
-26.209677419354836," Orcel's 112 million euro claim against Santander in court Sept. 14 MADRID (Reuters) - A Madrid court will start preliminary proceedings on Sept. 14 for a lawsuit brought by Italian banker Andrea Orcel against Santander SAN.MC over the bank's withdrawal of an offer to make him CEO, a court spokesman said on Thursday. Initially, the hearing was scheduled to take place on April 13 but ordinary judicial activity in Spain was suspended during the coronavirus lockdown. Orcel, one of Europe’s most famous bankers, is suing the Spanish bank for 112 million euros ($126 million), claiming breach of contract. He was offered the CEO job at Santander in September 2018 but the bank changed its mind the following January, saying it could not meet his pay demands. “The preliminary hearing is scheduled for September 14 at 11.00 am, when technicalities such as what procedural evidence or which potential witnesses can be accepted will be decided as part of the case,” the court spokesman said. The case has raised interest in the financial community as hirings and firings of CEOs are generally done behind close doors with potential conflicts resolved privately. Santander declined to comment. Alvaro Remon, Orcel’s lawyer, was not immediately available for comment. The hearing is part of a lengthy legal process that could take several more months before full trial, the court spokesman added."

-13.821138211382108," Santander to hire 3,000 IT professionals worldwide this year MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's Santander bank SAN.MC said on Thursday it would hire 3,000 IT professionals worldwide this year to support its digital transformation and improve efficiency, at a time when lenders are focusing on cutting costs. About 1,000 of the new hires will be in Spain, with a particular focus on individuals with a background in science, technology, engineering and mathematics. As part of a digital drive unveiled in April last year, the euro zone’s second-biggest lender in terms of market value said it would invest 20 billion euros ($23 billion) in technology by 2022. Santander said the recruits would be in areas including security and operations, artificial intelligence, software development and cybersecurity. Like many euro zone banks, Santander is trying to cut costs in Europe to offset a squeeze on margins due to rock-bottom interest rates, and the prospect of bad loans due to the coronavirus crisis. Meanwhile, it is looking to Latin America for higher profitability. Santander said it aimed to achieve 1 billion euros in cost savings in the medium term in Europe out of its 1.2 billion euro global target. As of end-March, the bank had an efficiency ratio of 47.2%, significantly better than Spanish lenders’ 52.7% average and the 64% European average, according to data from the European Banking Authority."
11.009174311926593," Santander's profit slides as it sets aside $1.7 billion for COVID-19 loan losses MADRID (Reuters) - Banking giant Santander's SAN.MC quarterly net profit dived by 82% as it set aside 1.6 billion euros ($1.7 billion) to cover expected loan losses caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Spanish bank, like its peers, has been taking steps to counter risk as the global economy reels as a result of the coronavirus crisis. The loan-loss provisions rose 80% in the first quarter, though CEO Jose Antonio Alvarez said they had not been allocated to any specific markets. The euro zone's second-largest bank by market value, after BNP Paribas BNPP.PA, reported a net profit of 331 million euros for the first quarter that ended in March. Excluding extraordinary provisions, which also included 46 million euros of restructuring costs in Europe, Santander’s underlying quarterly profit rose 1% to 1.98 billion euros. That exceeded an average analyst estimate of 1.8 billion euros in a Reuters poll. “Our underlying quarterly operating performance was strong, with a relatively limited impact from COVID-19. The pandemic is, however, causing a global health crisis and significant economic and social distress,” Santander Chairman Ana Botin said. The lender said it was still too early to know the full economic effects of the crisis, adding that the bank would revise its strategic targets once it had a more complete understanding of the full impact of COVID-19. It said last April that it aimed to lift its return on tangible equity (ROTE), a measure of profitability, to 13-15% in the medium term. In March this year, it had fallen to 8.75%, from 12.62% at the end of 2019. Shares in Santander rose 0.5% by 0723 GMT, outperforming Spain's Ibex-35 index .IBEX, which was down 0.3%. The bank has boosted its lending capacity, in part, by scrapping its final 2019 dividend As of the end of March, Santander had a core tier-1 capital ratio - the strictest measure of solvency - of 11.58%, compared with 11.65% at end of last year. Including the full implementation of new accounting standard IFRS-9, with an impact of 25 basis points, Santander’s capital ratio stood at 11.33%. The bank’s diversification overseas, especially in Brazil and Mexico, has helped it cope with tough conditions for lenders in Europe in the years since the financial crisis. A solid underlying performance in Latin America and North America, boosted by strong loans growth, offset sluggishness in Britain and Spain in the quarter. In Brazil, where the lender makes close to a third of its earnings, underlying profit fell 3.7% in the quarter though was up 10% when stripping out the variation from the exchange rate. In Mexico, where it makes 10% of its earnings, operating profit was up 22%, while profits rose 50% in the United States. Its net interest income, a measure of earnings on loans minus deposit costs, was 8.49 billion euros, down 2.2% from the same quarter last year due to pressure from low interest rates in Europe. In Spain, its second-biggest market, net profit fell 1% though lending was supported by state credit lines, which resulted in higher activity in SMEs and corporates at the end of the quarter and in April, worth 9.6 billion euros. In the UK, its fifth-largest market, net profit fell 26% due to competitive pressure in the mortgage market and looked likely to fall further after the division warned of tighter income resulting from weaker demand for loans. It blamed a 122 million pounds ($152.1 million) COVID-19 impairment charge for a 58% fall in statutory pretax profits."
18.957345971563978," Santander launches money transfer app in UK to fend off competition from fintechs MADRID (Reuters) - Santander SAN.MC on Thursday launched a money service app in the United Kingdom that will initially be free of fees for transfers of up to 3,000 pounds ($3,740) due to the coronavirus pandemic as lenders try to fend off competition from start-ups in the payments industry. Santander said its completely owned PagoFX, a low-cost international money transfer service, would be available via a mobile app and allow UK residents with a debit card issued by any UK bank or financial entity to send money abroad from their smartphone with low costs and using real-time foreign exchange rates. Banks, which are already struggling to lift earnings due to low interest rates, face rising competition from tech start-ups like technology platform PayPal PYPO.L and the likes of London-based TransferWise that offer foreign exchange payments to retail and small-business customers with lower fees. On Thursday, Santander said the service will also be rolled out to sole traders and small and medium-sized enterprises in the UK via the PagoFX website and mobile app in the near future. Cedric Menager, the chief executive officer of PagoFX, told Reuters in phone interview that the plan was “to expand in key markets in Europe this year and then within three or four years we plan to be in more than 20 countries.” According to a report by professional services firm Accenture from September, banks are set to miss out on as much as $280 billion in revenue from their payments operations by 2025, as new start-ups muscle in. Menager, who did not give any short or mid-term goals, said that given the coronavirus outbreak we “felt it was even more important to have a proposal like this to send money at the lowest cost.” Until 16 June 2020, PagoFX will waive international money transfer fees on transactions up to a limit of 3,000 British pounds per user, Santander said in its statement. Above that limit, it would charge fees of between 0.70% and 0.80%. Santander said this new service was part of its digital transformation outlined in 2019, which envisages investments of over 20 billion euros ($21.72 billion) in technology over the next four years."
12.10762331838565," Santander boosts lending capacity to 90 billion euros after cancelling dividends MADRID (Reuters) - Santander SAN.MC has boosted its lending capacity to 90 billion euros ($97.3 billion) to support households in the fight against the coronavirus outbreak after cancelling its final 2019 dividend and its remuneration policy for 2020, chairman Ana Botin told investors on Friday. The European Central Bank had already told lenders to skip dividend payments and share buy backs until October at the earliest and use profits to support an economy hamstrung by restrictions on movement implemented to stop the spread of the virus. “Today more than ever it is imperative to follow the supervisor’s recommendation,” Botin told investors at a remotely held annual shareholders’ meeting. The lender said on Thursday it would cancel the final 0.13 euros per share dividend against its 2019 earnings to boost capital defences, with Botin saying on Friday this would save the euro zone’s biggest lender in terms of market value 1.6 billion euros ($1.7 billion). Botin said that the bank would hold another annual general meeting in October at which “a payment to shareholders might be considered”. However, Santander would wait until there was more visibility on the coronavirus crisis and its own 2020 financial results were known before proposing any dividends. Banks must set aside capital to offset lending risk, with any increase in funds allowing them to increase lending by multiples of that amount. Even with a broad lockdown in place since March 14, Spain has registered an increase in coronavirus cases to more than 117,000. The death toll reached almost 11,000 on Friday. “MARGINAL IMPACT” IN Q1, MATERIAL IN WORSE SCENARIO Botin said she expected the bank’s 2020 first quarter underlying earnings to be in line with the first quarter of 2019, with a “very marginal impact from the coronavirus crisis on business results in the first 3 months of the year.” However, the bank’s chief executive officer Jose Antonio Alvarez said Santander was considering two scenarios - one where the crisis was over relatively quickly and one where it lasted longer with a material impact on the lender that would probably stretch into next year. “Considering the current uncertainty and the low visibility over the short-term evolution of the economy, we will reassess our medium-term goals once the situation stabilises,” Botin said. She called for European authorities to show solidarity and said it was “now time for Europe to rise to the occasion and lead a faster and more coordinated response” to the coronavirus outbreak. “Without solidarity there is no union,” she said. On Thursday, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), the EU’s bailout-fund, should be made available as a source of financing to countries with only minimal conditions attached and without stigma for using it. Last week, EU leaders gave finance ministers until April 9 to come up with ideas on how to finance the recovery after Germany and the Netherlands shot down a call from France, Italy, Spain and six other countries for a common debt instrument issued by a European institution."

The initiative by the euro zone’s biggest bank in terms of market value could pressure other European banks to follow suit with similar measures as large companies, small and mid-sized businesses and households grapple with the impact of the respiratory disease. Spain has been in lockdown since March 14. Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said on Sunday he would seek parliamentary approval to extend a two-week state of emergency by 15 days, until April 11, in an effort to combat the coronavirus. The number of coronavirus cases in Spain rose to 33,089 on Monday, making Spain the second hardest-hit European country, after Italy. The country’s death toll surpassed 2,000. “The scale of the task before us demands a huge collective effort, with governments, central banks and other authorities, the private sector, charities and individuals, working together to limit the spread and provide care for those affected,” Santander Executive Chairman Ana Botin said in a statement. While the European Central Bank has promised emergency liquidity and credit lines, European governments are scrambling to put together additional spending packages. Although Santander said on Monday it met the capital requirements to maintain its current dividend policy of a 40% to 50% payout ratio, the board committed to review the dividend paid from 2020 earnings in order to direct resources to support people and businesses in need. The bank said its board agreed to consolidate any dividend from 2020 earnings into a single final proposed dividend, to be submitted to the Annual General Meeting for approval in 2021, once the full impact of the pandemic was known. Santander usually pays dividends twice a year, its first in November and the second and final full-year dividend the following May. Against 2019 earnings, Santander paid 0.23 euro per share in dividends. To support efforts to fight the coronavirus outbreak, the bank said it created a fund of at least 25 million euros ($26.8 million) financed through a reduction in compensation of senior management, board compensation and voluntary contributions from Santander employees. The bank said that Botin and Chief Executive Jose Antonio Alvarez had committed to reduce their total compensation (salary and bonus) by 50% for 2020, and the compensation of non-executive directors would be reduced by 20%. As part of wider measures, Santander also said on Monday it would hold its annual shareholders’ meeting at its Madrid headquarters instead of in the northern port city of Santander, without guests attending in person. Santander has also closed slightly less than half of its branches in Spain because of reduced visits from clients as the coronavirus spreads, a source with knowledge of the matter said on Friday, while its more than 20,000 staffers in Spain are already working from home."

Orcel was offered the CEO job at Santander in 2018 but the bank changed its mind in January 2019, saying it could not meet his pay demands. Santander’s decision to withdraw the job offer marked a rare U-turn involving such a high-profile appointment at a major bank. Orcel in the criminal lawsuit claimed that Santander submitted as evidence four emails in which the bank redacted its logo and sender’s name in an attempt to mislead the judge. But the Madrid criminal court said the content of the emails was not contested. “The defendant’s conduct would fall within the crime of attempted procedural fraud, if the submission of the four emails, without the sender (name) and with or without the bank’s logo were suitable to mislead the court, which despite the effort of the complainant (Orcel) is unlikely, because the content of these emails is not contested,” the court said in its document. The document, dated Feb 11 but released on Friday, said Orcel’s lawsuit did not meet the legal requirements to proceed against Santander. Orcel can appeal within five days before a regional court. Santander and Orcel’s law firm, DeCarlos Remon, declined to comment. Orcel, one of Europe’s most high-profile bankers, is suing Santander for 112 million euros ($121.42 million) in a separate civil lawsuit claiming breach of contract. Orcel had resigned as head of UBS’s investment banking business to take up the Santander offer. Orcel has alleged that a four-page letter in which Santander offered him the job was legally binding, while Santander says the letter did not constitute a contract as defined by Spanish law.

-45.1530612244898," Special Report: When Ana ditched Andrea - The saga of Santander LONDON (Reuters) - In September 2018, Santander, one of Europe’s biggest banks, tweeted a video of its incoming new chief executive, an Italian investment banker named Andrea Orcel. Depicting a meeting with the bank’s boss, Ana Botin, the clip showed the silver-haired Italian cutting the air with a decisive gesture. A few months later, the bank shot a new video, intended for investors and the media, at its Madrid headquarters. It shows Botin, who heads a 150-year-old banking dynasty, saying she has withdrawn the offer because the new man’s pay would be too high for the bank, according to two people with direct knowledge of the sequence. In the video, Orcel is shown appearing to agree with the outcome. That clip was never released; in fact, the Italian now says he was misled. The rupture that followed the meeting has turned into one of the bitterest and highest-profile employment disputes in recent European history, yielding a lawsuit that is due later this year in a Spanish civil court. This account of the Botin-Orcel clash, the most comprehensive yet assembled, offers a rare glimpse inside the top level of one of the world’s largest banks, a family-led giant with a culture all its own. It is also a story of how, a decade after bankers were blamed for a crippling global financial crisis, the reality of austerity has been slow to fully sink in. In May, Orcel sued Santander, demanding that the bank honor its offer or pay him 112 million euros ($123 million) in damages - equivalent to equivalent to about 1% of the bank’s profits in 2018. In his suit, Orcel says a letter laying out his pay was a binding contract and that the video showing him accepting its withdrawal was shot on a false pretext, according to documents he submitted in court. In response, Santander said that under Spanish law, an offer letter is not a contract and that Orcel’s behavior during negotiations led the bank to lose confidence in him. Whatever the court decides, a rich body of evidence - texts and online messages between the pair and their family members, extracts from court documents, and interviews with eight people involved - shows a cosy relationship corroding. The messages - some reported here for the first time - suggest the hiring process for one of Europe’s most important financial jobs went awry partly because old ties between powerful people led to hasty assurances and false assumptions. Ana Botin, now 59, was a senior banker who had been named executive chairman of the group to succeed her late father, Emilio, a legendary patriarch who had built Santander into a global business through savvy acquisitions. Orcel, 56, a widely respected banker who according to some media looks like ‘the George Clooney of investment banking,’ had been Botin’s go-to investment banker for advice on deal-making and strategy. “What is most important to me is your energy and enthusiasm; and I know that both for you personally and for your family this will be a good thing!” July 25, message from Ana Botin to Andrea Orcel (This and other reproductions of text messages are based on original texts or submissions to court seen by Reuters. Some were originally written, in whole or part, in Spanish and have been translated. Some were redacted, and Reuters has edited two to preserve the anonymity of people with incidental roles in the story.) When the wooing began in mid-2018, Botin and Orcel’s Portuguese wife, Clara Batalim-Orcel, chatted about the Orcel family’s plans to swap its mansion in Holland Park, London, for a nice place in Madrid, sources with knowledge of the matter said. But for all its promise, terms of the September, 2018 offer to hire Orcel, reviewed by Reuters, were not clear. Crucially, Santander promised to pay “up to” 35 million euros of a 55 million euro package that Orcel was due to receive in future years from his employer at the time, Swiss bank UBS. The letter said Orcel would make his “best efforts” to cap that cost for Santander by getting the Swiss bank to contribute some of it. UBS refused, and Orcel would not accept less than 35 million euros. By the end, the bankers and their spouses would have a frosty encounter in a coffee shop near London’s Mayfair. And Santander’s board had issued a statement questioning what it called Orcel’s “dubious ethical and moral behavior,” alleging he was secretly taping private conversations - which a source close to Orcel told Reuters he had done on legal advice. The fallout has gripped Europe’s investment banking industry, where Orcel is one of the best-known dealmakers. It also raised questions about how one of Europe’s most important banks - Santander has 144 million customers worldwide - could name a new CEO without first finalizing his pay. Santander, founded by Royal Decree in 1857, has been run by the Botins for four generations. Its style has long been to move swiftly when needed, said Mauro Guillen, a management professor at Wharton School in Pennsylvania, who has written a book on Santander’s development into a global bank. “The bank is always very nimble when it comes to making bold decisions,” he said, adding that in a rapidly changing environment, this made it popular with investors. But the way Orcel’s appointment was handled shows Santander’s speediness does not always pay off. “If the bank wants to hire, not just a CEO but top executives, a lot of people may think twice” in the wake of the Orcel debacle. Invited to comment on the details of its rupture with Orcel, the bank referred to a statement it made last year in response to Orcel’s suit and media reports, saying it had followed a robust appointment process that met the highest standards of corporate governance and giving its reasons not to proceed with his appointment. Orcel declined to comment ahead of the court hearing, and UBS declined to comment. “GLADIATOR” Orcel knows Santander better than any other investment banker. Over nearly three decades as a dealmaker at Bank of America Merrill Lynch and UBS, he worked on dozens of transactions that helped Emilio Botin transform the bank. The biggest of these was when Santander joined a consortium and bought parts of ABN Amro, a major Dutch bank, in 2007. Orcel is a driven and talented banker, interviews with former colleagues show. Having run investment banking at UBS since 2012, he had also made clear his desire for a CEO post, telling the Financial Times in 2015 that “of course” he wanted to run a bank some day, and if he could choose, UBS would be a good place to start. When Emilio Botin died suddenly in September 2014, Ana, the eldest of his six children, was swiftly named to follow him. She would continue the family line in a bank whose shares are now mostly owned by institutional investors and funds. By appointing her, Santander followed a Spanish tradition of banks controlled by a single head, rather than a separate chairman and CEO, as the European Central Bank has said should be the norm. The Botin family is part of Spain’s aristocracy - the King of Spain made Botin’s mother a marchioness in 2008. Ana, whose full name is Ana Patricia Botin-Sanz de Sautuola O’Shea, was made an honorary Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Britain’s queen for services to the British financial sector in 2015. A keen golfer who describes herself as highly competitive, Botin was ranked by Forbes as one of the world’s most powerful women; she told Spanish TV in January the special thing about her job is the power it gives to change lives for many people. She started her career at JPMorgan, successfully turned around Santander’s Spanish subsidiary Banesto, and ran its business in the UK, one of the bank’s largest. In Santander’s top slot, she faced a challenge to sustain the growth rate her father had achieved. Emilio’s strategy of swallowing businesses in emerging markets had won plaudits for shielding Santander from the worst of the 2008 financial crisis, even as its home market was in deep recession. But when Emilio died, growth in Latin America was slowing and Santander’s business in Britain and the United States faced strong headwinds. Like other banks, it was under pressure to bolster its capital. In September 2015, a year after Emilio’s death, Santander’s share price was down around 30% from when Ana had started. Orcel the adviser was on hand. Four months after Ana Botin’s elevation, he helped arrange a massive 7.5 billion euro capital increase, which took place overnight and was called “ballsy” by trade magazine Euromoney. Again, in 2017, Orcel advised when Santander picked up an ailing domestic rival, Banco Popular, for one euro. He arranged a 7 billion euro capital boost for Santander to cover Popular’s bad debts. In early 2018, with Santander’s stock still lagging, Botin asked Orcel to outline a strategic plan to help lift the bank’s share price, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters. That July, when the two met for dinner at the Loews Regency hotel on Park Avenue in New York, she had a proposal: Join the bank as CEO and implement the plan. One idea they discussed was that Santander could sell its underperforming U.S. and British units - a task Orcel would execute. People familiar with the discussions said Orcel pledged loyalty to Botin. He compared his new role to that of the fighter Maximus, played by Russell Crowe in the 2000 movie “Gladiator,” leading the troops into battle for his emperor. For Orcel, Santander would be a radical switch. Investment bankers deal with big corporations and investment funds, while commercial ones serve small companies and individuals. He would be leaving the relationship-driven world of investment banking - which he has likened to selling designer handbags such as Louis Vuitton - to a hands-on role in a major commercial bank, which he has said is more “potatoes and tomatoes,” comparable to Wal-Mart. “WORKING ON DETAILS €” With the offer in place, the next topic was pay. Orcel was used to big money. While working at Merrill Lynch, he had made headlines after receiving a $33.8 million bonus from the Wall Street investment bank for 2008, a year when Merrill’s net loss swelled to $27.6 billion. UBS had granted him a compensation package due to be paid out over several years, including roughly 55 million euros worth of stock to be paid in future, four sources familiar with the matter said. Such deferred pay is one of the ways investment bankers in the European Union, where bonuses have been capped since 2014, have found to keep up their incomes, said Anna Marietta, co-founder and managing partner of London-based headhunting firm Vici Advisory, which specializes in investment banking. It is meant as an incentive to lock executives into a bank: If they leave, executives in theory forfeit pay they’ve accumulated. In practice, it doesn’t work like that. When investment bankers move jobs, the new employer usually ‘makes them whole’ by paying their deferred compensation. In the investment banking world, this is seldom a point of contention. UBS had done it for Orcel when he joined from Bank of America in 2012. The Swiss bank topped up his $7 million in base salary with $26 million in deferred compensation carried over from his former employer, its annual report showed. “It is very rare that compensation over deferred pay becomes a problem,” said Marietta. “In fact, none of my clients has ever experienced issues with it.” It’s also very rare for a top investment banker to go directly into a top position in commercial banking. Usually they take a break between posts. In September 2018, Ana Botin messaged Orcel to say colleagues at Santander were on board with his appointment and a staffing committee was working on financial details. “Andrea. Nomco (nominations committee) 100pc supportive and working on details €. Regards.” Sept. 10, message from Botin to Orcel Orcel had told his boss at UBS about Botin’s approach on the sidelines of an internal meeting in Zurich. There is no record of exactly how the CEO, Sergio Ermotti, responded, and UBS declined to comment. Orcel later messaged Botin saying his boss had said that if the Italian was moving on, it would be good to announce this before a planned investor day in October. But there was a problem. As Spain’s biggest lender, Santander needed to be mindful of the public mood – as well as the reaction of its 200,000 staff around the world. This was particularly true in the summer of 2018. The country was still recovering from a devastating recession. A Socialist government had just taken power, and some people thought it would impose a new bank tax. Santander was negotiating a large round of job cuts - trade unions said it cut 1,100 staff in Spain in 2018, a figure Santander did not dispute. Botin saw room to maneuver, thanks to Santander’s relationship with UBS. Her father’s dealings with Orcel had turned Santander into a big client for the Swiss bank: In each year the Spanish bank did a major deal, it brought UBS more than 50 million euros in fees, according to people familiar with their relationship. The banks declined to comment. Botin saw a chance that UBS Chairman Axel Weber would want to keep that business going, the messages show. UBS itself might stump up some of the deferred compensation that Orcel stood to lose. If Weber decided not to, Botin told Orcel in a message, Santander would threaten to pull their business. “There is a line I had reserved for Axel: if they decide not to pay you anything because we are their competitors, then it is good to know this, that they will not act as our strategic advisors – this is irrefutable and an “elegant” way of not beating around the bush.” Sept. 10, Message from Botin to Orcel A few days later, Botin approached UBS to pave the way for discussions with its chairman, Axel Weber. The Swiss bank’s executives were all meeting in Singapore, where Orcel spoke to its CEO, Sergio Ermotti, and another UBS board member. “They are helping us,” he messaged to Botin. “I have the green light from Sergio. Can you send me Axel’s mobile for me to call him? Sergio has already given me the green light. I’ll call you later and tell you about it. Un abrazo. Ana” Sept. 17, message from Botin to Orcel But when Santander’s boss got to speak to UBS chairman Weber, she found out he was not on board. He wanted Orcel to stay. Weber wrote an email to Orcel’s wife, Clara - whom Orcel consults closely on major career moves - saying the Swiss bank wanted to offer her husband a more senior role at UBS, that could pave the way to him succeeding Ermotti. “Dear Clara, we have tried to offer him a way to stay at UBS with the same job perspective as outside UBS. The board is unanimous on this and committed to facilitating an orderly transition. It is now his choice and his decision. I appreciate it is a difficult choice. I have also talked to Ana and I was clear to her so that she does not base her actions and her offers on assumptions. I am aware that this will have consequences down the road but everything we do or don’t do has. But as long as what we do is the right thing in our mind we will have to be happy to live with these consequences.” Sept. 19, email from UBS Chairman Axel Weber to Clara Batalim-Orcel Weber said in the message that he had spoken to Botin, “and I was clear to her so that she does not base her actions and her offers on assumptions.” Orcel messaged Botin later about UBS’s offer. “Board made a counter offer... Sergio promised he’ll talk to board today and ask them to put me in a fair position.” Sept. 20, 2018 – Message from Orcel to Botin On Sunday, Sept. 23, Orcel decided not to take up the counter-offer, and to quit UBS. Meanwhile, Botin was still trying to persuade UBS’s Weber to stump up some of Orcel’s deferred pay. Without success. “No se mueve (he is not budging). Says none of it at all.” Sept. 23, message from Botin to Orcel “THE NUMBERS HAVE GONE UP” Despite this lack of movement from UBS, on Sept. 24 Santander’s board went ahead with an offer letter for Orcel. Orcel’s wife, Clara, was keen. She messaged Botin the same day to express support for what she called an agreement - it was not clear exactly what she meant - saying Orcel had told her that Botin’s word was “worth more than a thousand contracts.” “Cara Ana, I am super happy that you have finally reached an agreement for Andrea to join ... He has told me that your word is worth more than a thousand contracts, and I know that Andrea will give his best to deliver what you need. You know I am backing him up 150% in this change... thanks for your trust. Regards, Clara.” Sept. 24, message from Clara Batalim-Orcel to Ana Botin Santander’s offer was signed by Santander’s General Secretary Jaime Renovales. It would make Orcel the highest-paid bank CEO in the euro-zone – and put his annual pay on par with Botin, who was paid almost 10.6 million euros in 2017. Her pension pot is worth about 46 million euros, according to Santander’s annual report. Santander promised Orcel a sign-on bonus of 17 million euros, annual salary including bonus of 10 million euros, and deferred compensation in the form of shares. But the details on that were vague. “Banco Santander expects that you will do your best efforts to ensure that your current employer will continue to pay the long-term incentive plans of which you are a beneficiary under the same conditions as if you were employed. Should your current employer pay only partially your long-term incentives or an amount lower than the one you would have received remaining in the company, we will pay a buyout of a maximum of 35 million gross euros.” Sept. 24, letter from Santander to Orcel The next day, Orcel was appointed CEO, with the paperwork still to be finalised. He was invited to join discussions with Santander executives and a month later, made a member of an internal WhatsApp group called Promontorio, court documents show. Santander released the first video, where he was pictured gesticulating in a meeting with Botin and the man he was due to replace, Jose Antonio Alvarez. Behind the scenes, negotiations on Orcel’s pay were intense. Rather than letting the Italian go quickly, his Swiss employer insisted Orcel take a full six-month “gardening leave,” the gap top financiers usually take between jobs with a competing institution. This meant he would not be able to join Santander until April 2019. Financially for Santander this could be good news - it meant part of Orcel’s deferred pay would fall due while he was still on UBS’s payroll. Santander figured, therefore, that its costs would be reduced. Its board calculated the reduction at around 13.7 million euros, it said in a later statement. But Orcel saw it differently. He did not think Santander should deduct pay from his deferred package while he was still a UBS employee. Some of it was a straight bonus for the previous year. And in his view, taking into account that his deferred package at UBS was worth about 55 million euros, he had already agreed to an effective pay cut of roughly 20 million euros, said sources familiar with his thinking. His last day at UBS was Sept. 30. But by October, things with Santander were going nowhere. Orcel apologized to Botin, reminding her that UBS had stumped up people’s deferred pay in the past, and hinting at a possible legal response. “I am very sorry to have to put you in this position. It seems like we are begging when it’s something that they have done before. If he doesn’t move we’ll have to take legal steps.” Oct. 19, 2018 – Message from Orcel to Botin Botin asked a Santander board member to speak to a counterpart in UBS, who refused to discuss the matter, saying UBS’s board was united behind Weber’s position, she told Orcel. “I understand then you must stay until the end gardening period which includes the vesting period for February. Let’s talk next week, let’s not keep going around on this. Un abrazo.” Oct. 20, message from Botin to Orcel The next month, Orcel’s figures changed. He told Santander that his original pay calculations had missed a few million euros that were due to him in dividends. This, according to a statement from the bank last July, would add more than 3 million euros to Santander’s bill. “It seems that we have missed a piece.” Dec. 10, Message from Orcel to a Santander HR executive “For numbers ... they have gone up.” Dec. 15, message from Orcel a Santander HR executive “THE NECESSARY EMPOWERMENT” On Dec. 17, Santander’s remuneration committee met. It noted “a degree of discomfort” at the revised claim from Orcel. It noted as well the fact that UBS was not paying up as much as it said Orcel had predicted, and the “reputational risk” of failing to cap his buyout. Board Secretary Renovales called Orcel - who by then was on a family holiday in Machu Pichu, Peru. But Orcel said he would only discuss the matter with Ana Botin. He typed her a long message on Dec. 20. He said any buyout of less than 35 million euros would no longer make sense for him, insisting he had already suffered a significant pay cut from his UBS package. He also asserted his need to “subordinate” other executives in the bank, using the image of a cascade system, in which he would be their boss; as chairman, she would have the opportunity to redirect him, as well as the final word. “I realize that we must motivate and empower the execs and country heads but also subordinate them to the group objectives, to a discipline of execution of our decisions and to the necessary empowerment that I need to have so we can achieve the objectives of the group and my mandate.” Dec. 20, message from Orcel to Botin from Peru In the Spanish banking world to date, the executive chairman has been the one with all the power - all the other executives defer to them. Orcel’s call for “the necessary empowerment” received a curt response. “We need to stop and see where we are at,” Botin said, suggesting a meeting in Madrid. “Andrea. We need to stop and see where we are at. To do this, we need to meet up and have a quiet and down-to-earth conversation, in person. Tuesday, 8th January, in Madrid?”... Dec. 20 message from Botin to Orcel Santander’s board was uncomfortable with the money, and with UBS not budging, Ana Botin was no longer sure her new right-hand man was putting enough pressure on Weber. “...On the issue of compensation, Axel is not budging. Basically 0. It is important that you continue to put pressure on your side. Regards. Ana.” Dec. 20 message from Botin to Orcel The pair met a day earlier than she first suggested, on Jan. 7, in Santander’s headquarters. Botin told Orcel she was withdrawing her offer: The Spanish political climate meant they couldn’t meet his pay demands. He was shocked, believing everything was still under negotiation, documents he submitted in court show. But she said there was no scope for further negotiation, because all the relevant authorities had been informed. At this point, a source close to him said, he started recording their conversations, a practice which is legal in Spain. On Jan. 15, Santander issued a statement saying Orcel would not be joining the bank, and its CEO Alvarez would remain in post. Orcel wrote to Renovales withdrawing his permission for Santander to use the second video, in which he had been filmed accepting Botin’s decision. He said he had agreed to film the video on the understanding that he and Santander could resolve the issue in a friendly way, but as this was not possible, he considered it to have been made on a false premise and so withdrew his permission for the bank to use it. “If you proceed, you do so without any agreement with all the possible consequences of the case,” he wrote. “You have destroyed my career, my reputation and have inflicted huge economic loss.” Jan. 15, Orcel to Renovales Ana Botin tried to smooth things over. She made various suggestions to Orcel, including possible financial backing to set up his own advisory boutique firm or private equity fund, or a top job in a Santander subsidiary, according to court documents. “I promise you that there are many ways of doing this; obviously, I will presume that UBS has said no to everything, and I want to know that, but I have companies in Spain where I could appoint you CEO or President tomorrow, listed real estate companies, I mean this cannot be part of (...), in other words, I have many options to compensate you, in areas that you are also qualified for (...).” Jan. 15, message from Botin to Orcel But no agreement could be found. The bankers’ last meeting was in early February, in a coffee shop in Belgravia, one of London’s most affluent areas, with Orcel’s wife Clara. They discussed other possible roles that Orcel could take, but he did not accept any, according to two people familiar with the events. Botin’s husband, Guillermo Morenés, dropped in on them while he was jogging past. In May, Orcel sued Santander for the job. The case is due to start being heard in April and could run well beyond a year unless the parties settle. For its most recent corporate deal, Santander turned to UBS’s arch-rival, Credit Suisse. Santander’s shares are around half the price when Botin started. Orcel remains in London. He has yet to take another post."
-42.46913580246913," Santander boosts capital, solid Latam business offsets European units MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's Santander SAN.MC boosted its capital ratio in 2019 and will target a further increase in 2020, the bank said on Wednesday, lifting its shares, as a solid underlying performance in Latin America offset sluggishness in Britain and Spain. Santander’s diversification overseas, especially in Brazil and Mexico, has helped it cope with tough conditions for lenders in Europe in the years since the financial crisis, but its has consistently had weaker solvency ratios than its European peers. The bank had said in the previous quarter that it was aiming to end 2019 with a capital ratio of 11.4% to 11.5%, but on Wednesday struck a more bullish tone saying its CET1 capital ratio had risen by 35 basis points to 11.65% and was expected to end 2020 close to 12%. Shares in Santander, the second-biggest bank in the euro zone in terms of market value, were up 3.4% at 3.67 euros by 0917 GMT, the top performer on Spain's blue chip index .SX7P. “We earned the loyalty of our customers, delivering record annual revenues and strong underlying profit. This allowed us to further strengthen our capital base and grow our CET1 capital ratio,” Santander’s Executive Chairman Ana Botin said. Taking into account a regulatory impact of 23 basis points from the full implementation of new accounting standard IFRS-9, the capital ratio stood at 11.42% compared to 11.07% at the end of September. “The big positive surprise was the strong capital generation...in the quarter,” JP Morgan said in a note to analysts. Santander also said it was well on the way to achieving its medium-term goals and expected to deliver high single digit average annual earnings per share growth over the next three years It posted a 35% increase in fourth-quarter net profit from a year earlier to 2.78 billion euros, beating analysts expectations of 2.5 billion euros, according to a Reuters poll. The bottom line was buoyed by capital gains of 711 million euros, mainly related to an agreement with Credit Agricole CAGR.PA to combine custody and asset servicing operations. Net profit for the whole of 2019 fell 16.6% to 6.5 billion euros, hit by one-off charges of 1.74 billion euros ($1.66 billion) related primarily to its British business in the third quarter. Overall, net interest income, a measure of earnings on loans minus deposit costs, was 8.84 billion euros, down 2.4% from the same quarter last year but 0.4% higher than in the previous quarter due to solid lending growth in Latin America. Analysts had forecast a NII of 8.86 billion euros. In Brazil, where the lender makes close to a third of its overall profit, underlying profit rose 4.6% in the quarter from a year earlier. In Mexico, its fourth biggest market, profit was up 42%. While low interest rates prevail across the euro zone, benchmark rates in Mexico stand at 7.25%. In the United States, where underlying profits rose 31.4% in the quarter, its Santander Consumer Holdings business announced on Wednesday an offer to buy up to $1 billion of its shares. On Wednesday, the bank also said it would pay a second dividend of 0.13 euros per share, which, when added to a 0.10 euro per share dividend paid in November, takes the full-year 2019 dividend to 0.23 euros per share, the same as in 2018."

-47.642679900744426," Breakingviews - Santander CEO fiasco exposes banking’s fault line LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - The battle over Santander’s CEO has given human shape to banking’s fault line. It’s a year since Ana Botin, the Spanish lender’s chairman, reversed her decision to make UBS executive Andrea Orcel the group’s next boss. In the coming months his 112 million euro lawsuit threatens to highlight the clash of cultures between retail and wholesale lending. The division is one of the most enduring splits in finance. A vast gulf still separates financial institutions which deal with consumers and small businesses, and those that make their living from corporate and institutional clients. The leading characters in the Santander drama personify the contrast. The silver-haired Orcel is a charming yet intensely competitive Italian who made his name advising on giant takeover battles. Botin is a patrician but steely executive who took charge of the 60 billion euro bank after her father Emilio died suddenly in 2014. Until July 2018 their relationship was that of a trusted adviser and his best client. But over dinner at the Loews Regency Hotel on New York’s Park Avenue, Botin proposed a different association. She was under pressure to revive the bank’s share price, which had declined by around a third during her tenure. Orcel outlined a bold plan to treble Santander’s value by selling businesses and purging underperforming regional managers. The same evening Botin informally gave him the opportunity to put his advice into practice as chief executive. For the hands-on chairman, it meant upgrading a position which had historically been occupied by low-key managers. Orcel accepted. His boss-to-be lauded his “energy and enthusiasm” in a jubilant text message. “I know that both for you personally and for your family this will be a good thing!” she wrote, according to a translation of Spanish court documents seen by Breakingviews. For Orcel, the job presented a step up. Since joining UBS in 2012, he had overseen a far-reaching restructuring of the Swiss group’s investment banking division. But his prospects of succeeding Sergio Ermotti as chief executive were hampered by his lack of experience in its flagship wealth management arm. Taking charge of Santander, which has some 200,000 employees spread across retail and commercial banking operations in Europe and North and South America, was an even larger leap. Orcel had spent his career with competitive investment bankers and demanding corporate executives, rather than the humdrum business of handling payments and mortgage applications. Yet any misgivings were swept aside. Announcing his appointment in September 2018, Botin lauded Orcel’s “collaborative” approach and “deep understanding of retail and commercial banking”. That declaration followed a less harmonious negotiation over compensation. To lure Orcel, Botin agreed to make him one of Europe’s best-paid bank CEOs, with annual pay of up to 10 million euros a year. The package rivalled Botin’s own total remuneration of 10.5 million euros in 2018. The CEO would also receive a signing-on bonus of 17 million euros. However, by changing jobs the Italian was potentially giving up about 55 million euros of deferred compensation from the Swiss bank, a legacy of post-crisis rules whereby senior executives are paid in stock that they cannot cash in for several years. Bankers who join a rival typically forfeit those payments, and demand compensation from their new employers. Santander’s board agreed to reimburse Orcel for up to 35 million euros of his deferred compensation, according to a copy of the offer letter seen by Breakingviews. But the bank hoped to avoid the bill. Encouraged by Orcel, Botin believed UBS would let the executive keep some of his deferred pay. After all, Santander was not a direct rival, and UBS Chairman Axel Weber would surely want to keep a valued client happy. “There is a line I had reserved for Axel,” Botin wrote to Orcel on Sept. 10, 2018, according to a Spanish court filing. “If they decide not to pay you anything because we are their competitors, then it is good to know this, that they will not act as our strategic advisors.” If such a threat was ever delivered it didn’t work: UBS refused to budge. The Swiss bank also insisted on Orcel serving his full gardening leave - the period before which he could take up his new job – which pushed back his start date to April 2019. Because he would still officially be a UBS employee, Orcel was therefore due to receive a chunk of deferred compensation worth 13.7 million euros in February. Santander’s board wanted to deduct this from the 35 million euros stipulated in its offer letter, reducing the cost of hiring Orcel. But the Italian resisted, arguing that this would involve him giving up more of his UBS pay than he had originally agreed to. This spat was followed by a disagreement over dividends on Orcel’s deferred shares. For investment bankers who tend to view their compensation as an absolute measure of their value relative to peers, sparring over pay is common. Santander’s board seemed less prepared for such disputes. At some point during this period, Botin also changed her mind about bringing in a high-profile second in command. In December 2018, while Orcel was in Brazil with his family, she wrote to him curtly, court documents show: “Andrea. We need to stop and see where we are at. To do this, we need to meet up and have a quiet and down-to-earth conversation, in person.” By the time the two met at Santander’s headquarters outside Madrid on Jan. 7 last year, Botin had privately admitted to other directors that the take-no-prisoner qualities which made Orcel an excellent adviser might be less suitable for a Santander executive. As potential buyers toured his London property, she bluntly told Orcel the appointment would not go ahead. A week later Santander announced the U-turn, claiming - somewhat disingenuously given the precise figure laid out in its letter - that the costs of compensating Orcel for leaving UBS had been greater than expected. Even so, Botin thought she could resolve the dispute amicably. “I promise you that there are many ways of doing this…I have companies in Spain where I could appoint you CEO or president tomorrow. I have many options to compensate you, in areas that you are also qualified for,” she wrote on Jan. 15, 2019. In February she travelled to London to meet Orcel and his wife in a cafe. The couple left saying the matter should be resolved in court. In June, the Italian filed a claim for 112 million euros, covering his UBS pay as well as compensation he would have earned at Santander, plus legal fees and damage to his reputation. Preliminary proceedings are scheduled for April. The battle is risky for Orcel. Suing your longest-standing client and prospective employer is hardly a great advertisement for a 56-year-old who still aspires to a top banking job. In the meantime, the lifelong workaholic is stuck on the sidelines. The risk to Botin is arguably greater, though. Santander could end up having to pay Orcel for the job he never got to start. Revelations over vast pay packages hurt the bank’s image with its retail clients, and call Botin’s leadership into question. Whatever the outcome, the fault line between retail and investment banking has rarely been more vivid."

-43.03178484107579," RPT-UPDATE 1-Investors snap up Santander CoCo bond, a year after controversy (Repeats story that ran on Thursday, with no changes) LONDON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Spain’s largest bank Santander sold a 1.5 billion euro ($1.67 billion) CoCo bond on Thursday, its first since it shocked investors last February with its decision to not redeem a similar hybrid debt issue. It priced the CoCo, “callable” after six years, for a 4.375% coupon. Despite last year’s controversy, orders topped 10 billion euros, according to a lead manager update seen by Reuters. “CoCos” or contingent convertible bonds, also known as AT1s, convert into equity if a bank’s capital level falls below a certain threshold. They were introduced after the 2008 financial crisis to ensure bondholders and shareholders both incur losses if a bank runs into difficulty, before taxpayer cash is needed. These securities tend to be perpetual, that is, they do not mature on paper, but issuers have the option to “call” them after a number of years, which they almost always do. The new deal comes in conjunction with Santander’s announcement it would redeem early its 1.5 billion euro 5.481% perpetual bond at the next call date on March 12. Last year it stunned investors when it opted not to call the 1.5 billion-euro CoCo on the Feb. 12 call date, soon after issuing a new one. It became the first European lender to not redeem this kind of debt and sparked fears other banks would follow. But the fears have since abated and subordinated bank debt has rallied; the average yield on the iBoxx index of euro zone subordinated bank bonds now stands at 0.92%, versus 2.26% a year ago. “They have been able to finance their AT1 considerably inside where they would have had to do it last year,” said a source familiar with the deal. The old, callable bond also rallied, meaning Santander could secure more attractive pricing on the new issue. It is saving around 100 basis points compared to the previous coupon. “The question was, if market participants reprice in general the refinancing risk, but the market still believes that the majority of bonds will get called,” said a credit analyst focused on banks. “So for most issuers it currently makes sense to exercise upcoming AT1 call dates in 2020 on economic terms.” Focus could turn to Deutsche Bank’s $1.25 billion 6.25% CoCo which is callable on April 30. Given it is trading at 94 cents on the dollar, the fear is the troubled lender will fail to call it. ($1 = 0.9002 euros)"

-43.85542168674699," Investors snap up Santander CoCo bond, a year after controversy LONDON, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Spain’s largest bank Santander was pricing a CoCo bond on Thursday, its first since it shocked investors last February with its decision to not redeem a similar hybrid debt issue. It was due to price a 1.5 billion euro ($1.7 billion) CoCo, “callable” after six years, for a 4.375% coupon. Despite last year’s controversy, orders topped 10 billion euros, according to a lead manager update seen by Reuters. “CoCos” or contingent convertible bonds, also known as AT1s, convert into equity if a bank’s capital level falls below a certain threshold. They were introduced after the 2008 financial crisis to ensure bondholders and shareholders both incur losses if a bank runs into difficulty, before taxpayer cash is needed.

Ebury is a trade and foreign exchange facilitator for small and medium-sized companies which operates in 19 countries and 140 currencies, Santander said in a statement. Santander said it is acquiring 50.1% of Ebury for 350 million pounds, of which 70 million will be new primary equity to support Ebury’s plans to enter new markets in Latin America and Asia. The bank said it expects a return on invested capital (RoIC) higher than 25% in 2024. “Small and medium-sized businesses are a major engine of growth around the world, creating new jobs and contributing up to 60% of total employment and up to 40% of national GDP in emerging economies,” said Santander executive chairman Ana Botin. Like banks across Europe, Spanish lenders have turned to more profitable enterprise lending in a bid to lift earnings as low interest rates squeeze financial margins. Santander is also focusing on emerging economies while cutting costs to counter squeezed margins from ultra-low interest rates in mature European markets. Santander said Ebury’s existing investors, including co-founders and management, would reinvest in the transaction and the current management team will remain. Ebury has generated average annual revenue growth of 40% in the last three years, Santander said in its statement."

-0.24449877750610727," UK worries offset Santander's solid Brazil performance MADRID (Reuters) - Santander SAN.MC reported a 75% fall in third-quarter net profit after one-off costs in Britain, while ongoing pressure on financial margins in Spain offset a solid performance in Brazil, its biggest market. The euro zone’s biggest lender by market value booked one-off charges of around 1.5 billion euros ($1.67 billion) as a result of a review of the goodwill ascribed to Santander UK, with uncertainty around Brexit. On top of the goodwill impairment, Santander also set aside 103 million euros for payment protection insurance compensation in Britain. Santander’s expansion overseas, especially in Latin America, has helped the bank cope with tough conditions for lenders in Europe in the years since the financial crisis. “Our diversification is one of the defining characteristics (...) and because of this we have continued to deliver predictable, profitable growth,” Santander Chairman Ana Botin said in a statement Santander reiterated the bank’s commitment to reach a medium term return on tangible equity target (ROTE), a measure of profitability, of 13-15%. Santander's shares opened about 0.3% higher before falling by more than 4% by 1335 GMT, underperforming the Spanish Ibex .IBEX blue chip market. The European banking index [.SX7P] was down a little more than 2%. “In a negative market session, Santander is being penalised but it looks like profit taking,” said Nuria Alvarez, analyst at Madrid-based broker Renta 4, referring to a broader sell off in financial shares. Goldman Sachs highlighted that Santander’s better than expected fees in South America broadly offset weaker financial margins in developed markets, notably Spain, Britain and the United States. In Britain, its third-largest market after Spain and Brazil, profit fell 63.4% due to a continued squeeze on mortgage margins and restructuring costs of 12 million euros, while financial margins also remained under pressure. Overall, Santander reported net profit of 501 million euros in the July to September period. Analysts expected net profit to come in at 445 million euros, according to a Reuters poll. Excluding the impairments, underlying profit rose 7% in the third quarter helped by trading gains. Overall, net interest income, a measure of earnings on loans minus deposit costs, was 8.8 billion euros, up 5.5% from the third quarter of last year boosted by Latin America. Analysts had forecast a net interest income of 8.85 billion euros. In Brazil, where Santander already makes nearly a third of its overall profits, net profit rose 24.7% in the quarter, while net interest income increased 7.7%. As part of its growth strategy, Santander recently increased the ownership of its Mexican business to 91.7% from 75%. In this market, net profit rose 20.6% In Spain, net profit rose 1% in the quarter though net interest income was down 7.4% against the same quarter last year and 4.2% lower against the previous quarter due to pressure from low interest rates. Chief executive officer Jose Antonio Alvarez said that a slowing of Spain’s economic growth was also “having a gradual impact” on business activity. In terms of solvency, Santander ended the quarter with a core Tier-1 capital ratio, a closely watched measure of a bank’s strength, of 11.3%, the same as in the previous quarter and in line with its medium-term target of 11-12%. Alvarez told analysts the bank expected to end 2019 with a capital ratio of between 11.4% and 11.5%. Taking into account a regulatory impact of 23 basis points with the full implementation of new accounting standard IFRS-9, the capital ratio stood at 11.07%. Looking forward, Alvarez said that between 2019 and 2020 he expected regulatory headwinds to impact solvency by between 80 and 90 basis points, with 60 basis points of that already accounted for."

6.175397643574584," Santander's venture capital fund eyes fresh Latin American investments MEXICO CITY/MADRID, Sept 27 (Reuters) - A venture capital fund backed by Spanish bank Santander is eyeing fresh opportunities across Latin America, an executive said on Friday, days after it completed an investment in Mexican financial technology startup Klar. Mexico and Brazil are the largest, most active and fastest-growing markets for so-called fintechs in Latin America. Local entrepreneurs have been developing technologies ranging from electronic payments to savings and loans. Manuel Silva, a partner at Santander InnoVentures, said in an interview the fund was seeking more investments in countries where Santander already had a presence, but primarily in Brazil and Mexico. “We continue to seek out companies,” Silva said. “We invest mostly in markets where the bank is present because those are the markets where we can add most value for the bank as well as for us as investors.” Silva said other markets of interest included Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Peru. InnoVentures did not disclose how much it invested in Klar, which offers digital alternatives to credit and debit cards. Klar said earlier this week that it secured $57.5 million in funding from different investors, including InnoVentures. The move in Mexico is part of Santander’s efforts to increase its focus on emerging economies while cutting costs to counter squeezed margins in mature European markets. Like other European banks, Spanish lenders are struggling to lift earnings as low interest rates squeeze financial markets. They are increasingly focusing on trimming costs and boosting efforts to sell services on digital platforms. As part of digital transformation, Santander also said it would invest over 20 billion euros ($21.9 billion) in technology over the next four years. Earlier in September, Santander said it would increase its ownership of its Mexican business to 91.65% from 74.96% after a stock exchange offer as it chases higher returns in Latin America. Mexico’s government has been looking to both banks and financial tech firms as it aims to reduce cash in circulation to cut down on money laundering and corruption, and to draw more people into the formal economy. The country’s banking regulator, CNBV, is evaluating the applications of 85 fintechs that have sought permission to operate in the country under the Mexican Fintech Law, which was issued in March 2018, and is considered a gold standard in the region.

7.201666468951238," UK competition watchdog reprimands RBS, Santander over PPI procedures LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's competition watchdog has ordered Royal Bank of Scotland RBS.L and Santander SAN.MC to appoint auditors to check how they remind customers who have payment protection insurance (PPI), amid a mis-selling scandal over the policies. The two banks failed to adequately remind customers about their PPI, some of whom might be due compensation as a result of Britain’s biggest ever consumer banking controversy, in which more than 36 billion pounds ($44 billion) has been paid back to those affected. Both previously breached an order by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) requiring banks to send annual reminders to customers about PPI, the CMA said. Spokespeople for both banks said the lenders have put in place measures to prevent a repeat of the errors, and apologized to customers affected by these mistakes. RBS failed to provide reminders to almost 11,000 of its customers for up to 6 years, the CMA said, while Santander sent out annual reminders containing incorrect information to over 3,400 of its mortgage PPI customers from 2012-2017. RBS has set aside 5.3 billion pounds for PPI compensation so far while Santander expects to reimburse up 1.6 billion pounds worth, according to data compiled by think tank New City Agenda. “It is unacceptable that some banks aren’t providing PPI reminders - or are sending inaccurate ones - 8 years after our order came into force,” Adam Land, a senior director at the CMA, said. “The legally binding directions we’ve issued today will make sure that both RBS and Santander now play by the rules.” The eight year-long PPI saga is set to close on Thursday after Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority set a deadline for consumers affected by the scandal to seek compensation from the banks. Friday’s sanction by the CMA will not lead to any extension of the FCA’s deadline for bank customers to contact their lenders about possible claims, a source familiar with the FCA’s thinking told Reuters. PPI policies were typically sold alongside a personal loan or mortgage to cover repayments if borrowers fell ill or lost jobs, but thousands of customers were sold unsuitable policies and would never have been able to make a claim."
-2.0179457799541964," Santander escalates war of words with Orcel in court battle MADRID/LONDON (Reuters) - Santander SAN.MC has accused Andrea Orcel, who is suing the Spanish bank for 100 million euros ($111 million) after it withdrew an offer to make him its chief executive, of ""dubious ethical and moral behavior"". Orcel, one of Europe’s most high-profile bankers, filed a lawsuit in Madrid this month claiming breach of contract. He was offered the CEO job at Santander last year but the bank changed its mind in January, saying it could not meet his pay demands. Orcel has alleged that a four-page letter written in September in which Santander offered him the job, along with a stock and bonus package to compensate for deferred pay he risked losing by quitting UBS UBSG.S, is legally binding. But Santander said in a statement on Friday that the letter to Orcel was not a contract as required by Spanish law. “A contract was never completed or fulfilled,” it said. Santander said it had learned through Orcel’s lawsuit that in January he started to record private conversations, without other parties’ knowledge or consent. “This is a practice of dubious ethical and moral behavior for someone who was potentially to become Santander’s CEO and has ultimately confirmed that the board of directors’ decision not to proceed with his appointment was right”. Orcel said in a statement that he was confident about the merits of his case, adding that all facts regarding his “effective appointment and subsequent illegitimate dismissal” by Santander would be “adequately subject to evidence in court, including all relevant witnesses’ evidence.” The statement said Orcel regretted Santander’s decision to make a public statement. It stressed “the material personal and professional damage” that followed previous public announcements on his hiring, dismissal and remuneration details. Orcel’s claim was filed on May 27 and was subsequently notified to Santander on June 27, the statement said, following months of trying to “find a constructive arrangement and after being persuaded on the lack of Santander’s willingness to redirect the matter to amicable terms.” Orcel did not comment further saying “this is a legal matter that shall be dealt with on strict legal terms and based on existing evidence by the competent court.” The lawsuit is expected to be handled by Madrid’s court Juzgado de Primera Instancia in October. But the case could take more than 18 months to reach a verdict, several lawyers have told Reuters. Santander’s decision to withdraw its job offer marked a rare U-turn on such a high-profile appointment at a major bank. Orcel had resigned as head of UBS’s investment banking business to take up the Santander offer. Sources familiar with the matter said Orcel and Santander’s executive chairman Ana Botin argued over the scope of his new chief executive role as he wanted more power and autonomy in taking decisions. While Santander’s balance sheet and share price are unlikely to be affected by a lengthy and draining lawsuit, the bank might feel uncomfortable at the level of public attention, in particular at home in Spain, a country still recovering from one of Europe’s biggest recent banking crises. In its statement, Santander, which had for months largely dodged questions on the dispute with Orcel, goes into a lot of detail into how its job offer fell apart. “From the beginning, Mr. Orcel conveyed expectations regarding UBS’ position with regard to the payment of his deferred compensation that were never met,” the statement said. “In the course of negotiations, not only did Mr. Orcel not make his best efforts to get UBS to pay a significant portion of his deferrals, he also refused to attribute the 13.7 million euros that UBS agreed to pay him (as non-deferred 2018 bonus and deferrals that were due in February) to reducing the cost to Santander.” A source familiar with the matter said Orcel was informed of his dismissal during a meeting with Botin on Jan. 7. He subsequently received legal advice to record all the conversations with Santander executives. The source said Botin offered Orcel a senior position in one of the real estate companies invested by Santander but the Italian banker turned it down as he felt he had enough evidence to sue the bank."

-3.083703326971636," Spanish costs and weak UK push Santander profit 18% lower MADRID (Reuters) - Spanish lender Santander SAN.MC reported an 18% fall in quarterly net profit hurt by one-off restructuring costs from its acquisition of Banco Popular and a weak performance in Britain despite a solid performance in Latin America. It reported a net profit of 1.39 billion euros ($1.56 billion) for the three months to the end of June, topping the 1.29 billion euros expected by analysts in a Reuters poll. The euro zone’s largest bank by market capitalization, which took over Banco Popular two years ago, recently agreed with unions on the closure of around 1,150 branches and layoffs in Spain -- around a tenth of its Spanish workforce. It said it would take charges of 706 million euros, 600 million euros alone in Spain, where it booked a loss of 262 million euros. Excluding one-off costs, underlying net profit in the quarter was up 5%. In Britain, its third-largest regional market after Spain and Brazil, profit fell 41%, due to a continued pressure on mortgage margins and to restructuring costs of 26 million euros and provisions of 80 million euros. It had a solid performance in Brazil and Mexico in the second quarter and Chairman Ana Botin told an extraordinary general meeting that Mexico was an important part of its plan to invest and grow in Latin America. Santander’s diversification overseas, especially in Latin America, has helped the bank to cope with tough conditions for banks in Europe in the years since the financial crisis. Santander confirmed at the meeting that it would fight a 100 million euro ($112 million) lawsuit being brought by Italian banker Andrea Orcel after it withdrew an offer to make him its chief executive earlier this year. Shares in Santander were up 3%, against a 1% rise on the Spanish blue chip market, the Ibex .IBEX. On Tuesday, investors signed off at an extraordinary shareholder meeting on a capital increase of 2.6 billion euros to finance the acquisition of a 25% stake they don’t own of its Mexican subsidiary. The move in Mexico is part of efforts to increase focus on emerging economies while cutting costs to counter squeezed margins in mature European markets. While record-low interest rates have prevailed in the euro zone for the past 10 years, rates in Mexico stand at 8.25%, the highest since the 2008 global financial crisis. In Mexico, where it aims to make around a tenth of its profits after the deal, profit rose 20% in the quarter. “We believe in Mexico, it economy and its financial sector, and we think this is an appropriate time to continue to invest in Mexico and our Mexican subsidiary,” Botin said, adding that this country offered higher profitability than other markets. Analysts highlighted a good set of underlying trends mostly driven by Brazil and stronger than anticipated net interest income and lower provisions. Net interest income, a measure of earnings on loans minus deposit costs, was 8.95 billion euros, up 5.6% from the second quarter of last year and 3.1% higher against the previous quarter due to a solid lending growth in Latin America. Analysts had forecast a NII of 8.76 billion euros. In Brazil, where the bank makes more than a quarter of its profits, profit rose 18% from a year ago, boosted by solid growth in business volumes, while profits in the United States rose 36%. Santander ended the quarter with a core Tier-1 capital ratio, a closely watched measure of a bank’s strength, of 11.3%, compared with 11.23% in the previous quarter, in line with its medium-term target of 11-12%. Santander’s chief financial officer Jose Garcia Cantera told analysts the bank expected another 20 to 30 basis points of regulatory headwinds in the second half of 2019. “But at the same time we would expect our capital to grow from here until the end of the year (...) our target is to get to 11.5 percent as soon as possible,” Cantera said."
-3.083703326971636," Santander to contest 100 million euro Orcel claim MADRID/LONDON (Reuters) - Santander SAN.MC said it would fight a 100 million euro ($112 million) lawsuit being brought by Italian banker Andrea Orcel after it withdrew an offer to make him its chief executive earlier this year. Santander offered Orcel, one of Europe’s highest profile bankers, the role but then changed its mind in January, saying it could not meet his pay demands. Former UBS banker Orcel has filed a lawsuit in Madrid with the help of law firm De Carlos Remon, claiming breach of contract. His claims are based on a four-page letter - signed by Santander’s general secretary Jaime Perez Renovales in September - in which the bank offered him the job along with a stock and bonus package to compensate for deferred pay he risked losing by quitting UBS, a source close to the Italian banker told Reuters. While Orcel’s lawyers say the letter is legally binding, Santander argues that Orcel wasn’t formally hired. The package which was mentioned in the letter consisted of 35 million euros of Santander’s shares and a 17 million euro bonus and would only be paid if Orcel failed to recoup all or part of his deferred pay from UBS, the source said. Santander, advised by law firm Uría Menéndez, has until the end of this week to draft a formal response. Santander Chairman Ana Botin referred the question to Renovales when it was brought up during an extraordinary general meeting in the northern Spanish city of Santander. “The bank has acted with total transparency and will present and defend its position before the courts,” Renovales said. “We are going to prove that the reasons given on the day to annul the appointment respond to reality and that the necessary conditions were not met for his appointment and hiring to be effective,” he added. Santander has said the cost of compensating Orcel for the deferred awards he had earned over the past seven years at UBS and other benefits would be significantly above the board’s original expectations. Santander fears public outrage in a country which is still recovering from one of Europe’s largest banking crisis and where executive salaries are far from matching those in London and New York. While its balance sheet and share price are unlikely to be affected by a lengthy and draining lawsuit, the bank might feel uncomfortable at the level of public attention. “The bank’s decision, although difficult, was the best for the group, and for its shareholders, and a rigorous governance process took place,” Renovales said on Tuesday. Santander reported an 18% fall in quarterly net profit on Tuesday hurt by one-off restructuring costs from its acquisition of Banco Popular and a weak performance in Britain. The lawsuit is expected to be handled by Madrid’s court Juzgado de Primera Instancia which could take more than 18 months to reach a verdict, several lawyers told Reuters. If any of the parties appeals, the case would likely move to Madrid’s Audiencia Provincial where deliberations could take another 18 months. In the event of a new appeal and if it is considered necessary for the Spanish judiciary system to set a precedent on court rulings, Spain’s Supreme Court would step in. It could take three to four years to come up with a final decision."
-3.083703326971636," Factbox - Santander vs. Andrea Orcel: how did things go sour? MADRID/LONDON (Reuters) - Spanish lender Santander SAN.MC said on Tuesday that it would fight in court a lawsuit being brought by Italian banker Andrea Orcel after it dropped an offer to make him chief executive. Ten months ago, the euro zone’s largest lender by market capitalization announced with fanfare its decision to name one of Europe’s best-known investment bankers as CEO. Here are the main points on how things went sour: On Sept. 25 last year, Santander announced the appointment of Italian banker Andrea Orcel as its new chief executive officer to replace Jose Antonio Alvarez and said the appointment was expected to be effective in early 2019 following regulatory approval. Santander said Orcel would bring a deep understanding of retail and commercial banking, as well as a strong track record in managing diverse teams, and would help build a global digital platform. Analysts at the time said they struggled to understand why Orcel, who had been the head of UBS Group's UBSG.S investment banking business since 2014 and a member of the bank's executive board since 2012, would become the CEO of a mostly dominant retail bank. His appointment immediately raised questions about a potential change in Santander’s strategy. Chairwoman Ana Botin responded that Santander was not planning any major strategy change and would remain a commercial bank operating in 10 countries. Orcel resigned from UBS and was put on six-month gardening leave after signing a job offer letter from Santander. However, on Jan. 15, Santander withdrew the offer to make Orcel CEO, making a rare, unexpected U-turn on such a high-level appointment. Santander said the cost of compensating Orcel for the deferred awards he had earned over the past seven years at UBS and other benefits would be significantly above the board’s original expectations at the time of the appointment. It did not mention any figures and did not say how big the pay gap was. But three sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters the deferred payment amounted to about 50 million euros ($57 million). At the beginning of March, Santander offered Orcel a senior advisory role in an attempt to mend fences with the former president of UBS’s investment bank, which he rejected, according to a source familiar with the matter. In March, Orcel hired Spanish legal adviser De Carlos Remon to handle his dispute with the bank. During an interview with the Financial Times in May, Orcel said: “I’m not known to be a person that lets go, especially when I think that the right thing to do is to not let go. It’s not only for me.

Santander was given about 20 days to respond to the lawsuit which 56-year old Orcel filed in a court in Madrid. Orcel’s claims are based on a four-page letter - signed by Santander’s general secretary Jaime Perez Renovales in September - in which the bank formally offered him the job along with a stock and bonus package to compensate for deferred pay he risked losing by quitting UBS, a source told Reuters. The package consisted of 35 million euros’ worth of Santander shares and a 17 million euro bonus that would only be paid if Orcel failed to recoup all or part of his deferred pay from UBS, a source with knowledge of the matter said."

Santander will have about 20 days to respond to a civil lawsuit which 56-year old Orcel plans to file in Madrid, sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Wednesday. “Orcel is claiming 100 million euros as part of a civil lawsuit for a breach of contract,” said one of the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.

The measures are part of Santander’s wider strategy to focus on cost savings in Europe while pursuing higher profitability on offer in Latin America. Along with other European banks, Spanish banks are struggling to increase profits as ultra low interest rates are squeezing returns. As a result, they are having to cut branches and boost efforts to sell services on digital platforms.

The euro zone’s biggest bank by market value reported net profit of 1.84 billion euros ($2.06 billion) against forecasts of 1.88 billion euros in a Reuters poll. Steady growth in Latin America business volumes, where it makes 45 percent of its earnings, was not enough to offset charges of 108 million euros in Britain and Poland and other costs related to asset sales and disposals. Charges in Britain and Poland were due to ongoing cost cuts involving branch closures in those countries Shares in Santander fell around 1 percent. Analysts said results were broadly in line though Goldman Sachs highlighted worse than expected earnings in Britain, the bank’s third-biggest market where it is facing fierce competition for lending, higher costs and uncertainty over Brexit. Net profit there fell 36 percent following a 66 million euro charge for restructuring costs. Excluding this impact, underlying profit fell by 15 percent, the bank said. Earlier in April, Santander offered to take full control of its Mexican business as Spanish banks chase potentially higher returns in Latin America. The move is part of efforts to focus on emerging economies to boost profitability while cutting costs to counter squeezed margins in mature European markets. In Mexico, where it aims to make around a tenth of its profits after the transaction, net profit rose 18 percent. While record-low interest rates have prevailed across the euro zone for the past 10 years, benchmark rates in Mexico stand at 8.25 percent, the highest since the 2008 crisis. In the United States, where it makes 7 percent of its earnings, net profit rose 46 percent thanks to higher lending and leasing volumes at its consumer business. In contrast, its Spanish rival BBVA on Monday said net profit fell 35 percent due to extraordinary impairments due to slower growth expectations. Net profit in Brazil, where it makes 29 percent of earnings, improved 7 percent on the year thanks to steady loan growth despite some pressure on prices. Overall, net interest income, the profit a bank makes on its core lending activities, was 8.68 billion euros, up around 3 percent from a year ago but down 4 percent against the previous quarter. Analysts expected NII to come in at 8.77 billion. In Spain, the bank’s second-biggest market, net profit fell 11 percent, while separately, Caixabank reported a 24 percent decline on lower trading income. Santander finished the quarter with a core tier-1 capital ratio of 11.25 percent compared to 11.3 percent at end-December. Taking into account regulatory impact of 23 basis points with the full implementation of the new accounting standard IFRS-9, capital ratio stood at 11.02 percent."

The new business will have around $3.8 trillion of assets under custody, closing the gap on European leaders and providing scope for savings and cost reductions. Banks’ custodian services departments look after assets for clients in return for fees. But it is often a low margin business and growing competition is making scale more important. Credit Agricole will own 69.5 percent of the merged unit, which will keep the brand name of Agricole’s existing asset management arm - Caceis. Santander will hold 30.5 percent. Santander’s ‘S3’ Securities Services arm in Spain and Latin America will also be combined with Caceis. Low profitability among European banks has sparked calls from officials at the European Central Bank and investors for cross-border consolidation, but regulatory issues and political opposition to foreign takeovers have stymied deals so far. Joint ventures in areas such as fund management can thus provide an easier option, allowing banks to benefit from scale by collaborating on business lines without having to go into any full-blown takeovers. Credit Suisse advised Santander on the deal, while Morgan Stanley worked with Credit Agricole, and one source involved in the deal said he expected similar collaboration deals between European banks in areas where they could make cost savings. The new entity will have about 3,340 billion euros ($3.8 trillion) in assets under custody and about 1,833 billion euros in assets under administration. That will make the new unit one of the largest European custody players behind BNP Paribas, HSBC and SocGen, while also creating a stronger competitor to U.S. leaders such as State Street and BNY Mellon. Credit Agricole shares were up 0.8 percent in early trading, while Santander’s were steady. “I welcome any consolidation in the European banking sector,” said Clairinvest fund manager Ion-Marc Valahu, who owns a position in the European banking index. “We use Caceis for our funds and it makes sense for CA to take over the custody and asset-servicing operations from Santander. In addition, Credit Agricole is increasing its foot print in Spain and Latin America,” added Valahu. Santander said it would see a capital gain of around 700 million euros from the deal. “S3 and CACEIS are highly complementary businesses, and by working together we can create a custody and asset servicing platform that leverages our collective scale and global presence, and offers clients a comprehensive service that can support their ambitions and help them to prosper,” said Santander Chairman Ana Botin. The tie-up comes amid other potential European bank deals. Germany’s Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank are in merger talks, while Italy’s Unicredit has also said it could explore a deal with Commerzbank. A German magazine said ING had also approached Commerzbank."

-6.8809760096475285," Santander seeks full ownership of Mexican business with $2.9 billion deal SANTANDER, Spain/MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Santander has offered to take full control of its Mexican business through a 2.6 billion euro ($2.9 billion) all-share deal as the Spanish bank chases potentially higher returns available from Latin America. The deal proposed on Friday, which was broadly welcomed by analysts but described as “oppressive” by a major investor, will unwind Santander’s listing of 25% of the bank on the Mexican stock exchange in 2012. The move is part of efforts to focus more on emerging economies while cutting costs to counter squeezed margins in mature European markets. While record-low interest rates have prevailed across the euro zone for the past 10 years, benchmark rates in Mexico stand at 8.25%, the highest since the 2008 global financial crisis. The Mexico deal will also bring Santander head to head with Spain’s second-largest bank BBVA, which makes about 40% of its earnings from Mexico. “(The deal) is an opportunity to gain exposure to a diversified, global bank with growing and more predictable results than those of comparable peers,” Chairwoman Ana Botin told shareholders at Santander’s annual general meeting. Earnings from Mexico are expected to rise to 10% of group profit, up from 8%, Botin said. Latin America as a whole accounts for 43% of the Spanish bank’s earnings. At least one investor, Bill Kanko, president of Black Creek Investment Management, took a dim view of the plan. The Canadian asset manager is the fourth-largest investor in Banco Santander Mexico, excluding the parent, according to Refinitiv data. “This is a ‘squeeze-out’ or ‘take-under’, and we have little recourse,” Kanko said. He said Santander’s offer carried only a small premium that did not fully compensate minority shareholders whose investments he said “subsidized” a spending program that started in 2017. Banco Santander Mexico said in 2016 it would invest $736 million in branches and technology. Kanko said that had depressed earnings in the short term but “made sense to us longer term.” “The growth opportunity in Mexican banking services, the repair of their balance sheet, the appointment of a highly respected CEO, the efficiency measures of the bank, and the governance of the parent company – how ironic – were the underpinnings of our investment thesis.” Reuters contacted the 15 largest investors in Banco Santander Mexico, excluding the parent, according to Refinitiv Eikon data, for comment. Several, including BlackRock, Vanguard and JPMorgan Asset Management, declined to comment. Others did not immediately respond. Damian Fraser, founder of Mexico City-based financial consultancy Miranda Partners, said Santander was also giving a vote of confidence to the new administration of President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, whose economic instincts have at times rattled Mexican markets. “They are betting on Mexico, they are putting 3 billion euros on the line. They’re believing in” Lopez Obrador, said Fraser, who worked on the Santander Mexico IPO in 2012 when serving as Mexico country manager for Swiss bank UBS AG. The disappearance of the stock did, however, reduce the amount of choice on offer on the stock exchange. “The Mexican stock market is already shrinking, it’s already fairly illiquid, and this is another blow,” Fraser said. The Mexico plan overshadowed Friday’s shareholder meeting, where some investors criticized management handling of an aborted process to hire Italian banker Andrea Orcel as chief executive. In an unusual U-turn on such a major appointment, the bank said in January that it could not meet his pay expectations. “It’s a good decision that you stopped it, but it is a mega-disclosure accident,” investor Hans Martin told the meeting, also asking if Jose Antonio Alvarez would remain as CEO for the foreseeable future. Mexico is a highly profitable market, where Santander has set a mid-term target of 19-21% for the underlying return on tangible equity. Santander’s shares rose nearly 2% on Friday. Santander, which holds about 75% of its Mexican business, said it would issue up to 572 million new shares, equivalent to up 3.5% of Santander’s market capitalization, to finance the deal. The new issuance is worth about 2.6 billion euros based on Thursday’s close, according to Refinitiv data. The euro zone’s biggest lender in terms of market value will offer 0.337 shares for 1 share of Santander Mexico and 1.685 shares per share to holders of Santander Mexico ADS. Santander said the exchange ratio represented a 14% premium to the closing prices of Banco Santander and Santander Mexico shares on April 11. Santander expects the transaction to have a return on investment of approximately 14.5%, to be neutral on earnings per share and to contribute positively to the group’s core Tier-1 capital ratio.

-2.6915364971000977," Santander focused on Europe cost cuts, Latin American profit MADRID (Reuters) - Santander assured investors on Wednesday that cost savings in mature markets in Europe and higher profitability growth in Latin America were enough to deliver on midterm financial targets while pushing its digital transformation. Santander said it was aiming for incremental annual cost savings of 1.2 billion euros ($1.4 billion) in the medium term, of which 1 billion euros would come from Europe. Europe’s banks are focused on cost savings as they attempt to offset a squeeze on margins due to ongoing record-low interest rates in the euro zone. Santander shares were up 2.1 percent at 116 GMT against a 1.4 percent rise on the European STOXX banking index. As part of its focus on efficiency in Europe, it said it was expecting 250 million euros of additional cost savings in Spain from the integration of Popular to boost its underlying profitability to between 14-16 percent from around 11 percent. When it first announced the acquisition of Popular in 2017, Santander said it was expecting cost synergies of close to 500 million euros per year from 2020. In Britain, Santander’s third biggest market, it said that as part of its strategy it would focus on cost management and continued risk discipline, without giving any specifics. Of its main markets, Britain was the area with the lowest underlying profitability target ratio. It set out a target of between 10-12 percent from 9 percent in 2018. Santander is expecting the British economy to grow around 1 percent over the next couple of years partially due to uncertainty over Britain’s decision to leave the European Union. “It could be better and it could be worse, but your guess is as good as mine. As to what’s going to happen I’m a bit confused,” Santander Chairman Ana Botin said when asked about the Brexit outcome. She stressed that the lender was taking a conservative approach toward lending in Britain. Santander said around 730 million euros of the total cost savings would come from efficiency gains in IT and operations and 220 million euros from shared services across regions, including Britain. The bank also said it was aiming to reach a cost-income ratio - a measure of efficiency - of between 42 percent and 45 percent at group level in the medium term from 47 percent. Santander reiterated it was aiming to lift its return on tangible equity (ROTE), a measure of profitability, to 13-15 percent in the medium term from 11.7 percent in 2018. In Brazil, the bank’s biggest market, Santander said it was expecting low interest rates to maintain growth in its loan book and keep improving its underlying ROTE above 20 percent. Its business in Latin America, responsible for 43 percent of the bank’s profits, was seen rising its profitability to between 20-22 percent, thanks to high and sustainable revenue growth. Santander also repeated a mid-term core Tier 1 capital ratio target of 11-12 percent, against 11.3 percent in 2018 but below the average of more than 12.5 percent among its European peers. Botin dismissed analysts’ concerns over the bank’s capital adequacy, highlighting the lender’s lower risk retail and higher diversification model. “Being prudent, having more capital, we all want that but at some point enough is enough and if they keep on building buffers and buffers, Europe will not grow, banks in Europe will have increasing problems and they will have less inclination to lend,” Botin told investors in London. With banks facing increasing competition from so-called new technology entrants, Santander also unveiled a plan to expand its digital bank, Open Bank, to 10 new international markets in order to reach two million customers. As part of its digital drive, Santander said it would invest over 20 billion euros in technology over the next four years. (This story has been refilled to fix typo paragraph 10)"

-3.158043593685466," Santander expected to trumpet Latam growth and reduce Brexit risk MADRID (Reuters) - Spanish bank Santander is expected to take a cautious stance on its British business in a strategy update on Wednesday, seeking to reassure investors after its aborted recruitment of former UBS banker Andrea Orcel as CEO. Though Brexit uncertainty is casting a shadow over the bank’s third-biggest market, the euro zone’s largest lender by market value is benefiting from its global diversification and expects solid growth in Latin America, which accounts for 43 percent of its earnings. The bank is expected to further protect its balance sheet in Britain, where higher costs have dented profitability, by setting stricter conditions for lending, a banking source said. Globally, Santander is likely to reinforce efficiency measures as part of its digital transformation to persuade investors that its latest profitability and capital targets can be maintained, analysts said. The bank declined to comment before the event. “This time the strategy update won’t be as much about setting new targets but rather outlining how they will be met,” a second banking source said, adding that cost-saving measures in mature European markets would also be key to offsetting a squeeze on lending from low interest rates. In January Santander said it was aiming to lift its return on tangible equity (ROTE) -- a measure of profitability -- to 13-15 percent in the medium term from 11.7 percent in 2018. It also set a mid-term core Tier 1 capital ratio target of 11-12 percent, against 11.3 percent in 2018 but below the average of more than 12.5 percent among its European peers. Analysts such as Jefferies still express some concern over the targets and capital adequacy. The bank says it is comfortable with its capital buffers because of its lower-risk retail model. It recently said it was considering reintroducing a scrip dividend in 2019, which UBS estimates would add 25 basis points to its capital through 2021. Continuing robust growth in lending volumes in Brazil, its biggest market, is expected to offset some pressure on pricing and financial margins, though other challenges remain. In the United States it is working to lift low profitability ratios of around 4 percent while savings from the integration of Banco Popular remain a focus in Spain, its second-biggest market. Investment firm Alantra expects Santander to deliver 600 million euros in cost cuts from the integration, compared with a target of 500 million euros as part of its attempt to improve its 10.8 percent underlying ROTE in Spain. The aborted hiring of Orcel is not on Wednesday’s agenda, but investors are likely to question the management over Santander’s decision in January to withdraw its job offer. “Orcel was seen as a potential dealmaker. Now that he is not on board, the bank wants to be seen as a robust retail bank with Latin America as its core growth story,” said Enrique Quemada, chief executive of investment bank ONEtoONE. Santander has said it is sticking with Jose Antonio Alvarez as CEO, but investors say a replacement in the medium term is not to be ruled out."

A spokesman for Orcel declined to comment. The Italian banker is in talks with Santander after the Spanish bank withdrew its offer to make him chief executive earlier this year as it would not meet his pay expectations. Decarlos Remon began working with Orcel a week ago to advise him on his legal strategy, according to a spokeswoman for the legal firm. “Orcel is still reviewing his options. There is no decision on whether he will sue Santander,” said a source close to the Italian banker. A Santander spokeswoman declined to comment. At the beginning of March, Santander offered Orcel a senior advisory role in an attempt to mend fences with the former president of UBS’s investment bank, two sources said. Orcel remains on gardening leave from UBS until the end of March, one of the sources said, and will later decide on his next steps. Santander’s decision in January to withdraw its offer to Orcel shocked the banking industry.

-7.732956650013606," Santander Brasil launches digital investment platform SAO PAULO, March 14 (Reuters) - Banco Santander Brasil SA on Thursday launched a digital investment platform, fueling competition with new brokerage firms vying for investors in Latin America’s largest economy. The new platform, called Pi, will offer products by Santander and also third parties, a move similar to what competitors Itaú Unibanco Holding SA and Banco Bradesco SA have done to regain market share from brokerage newcomers such as XP Investimentos SA and BTG Pactual Digital. Pi will offer investment products to mass retail customers, including lower income clients. The platform’s managers aim for it to reach up to 1 million clients within four years. The platform is managed separately from the bank and has partnerships with local asset managers TAG Investimentos, Vitreo Gestao de Recursos Ltda and Indosuez Wealth Management, as well as Santander private banking. Chief Executive Officer Felipe Bottino told journalists at a news conference that Pi’s model differs from that of competitors XP and BTG, which hires independent brokers and offers to pay clients fee rebates. “Investors will be able to cash these rebates and reinvest them” he said. Financial services firms have benefited from the country’s gradual economic recovery and record low interest rates have driven demand for a wide variety of investment products. In an effort to safeguard competition in the financial sector, Itaú Unibanco Holding SA acquired a 30.1 percent stake in XP’s voting capital last year."
-2.1695009513435637," Italy's Terna taps Santander to raise cash for Latam business: sources MILAN/LONDON (Reuters) - Italian power grid operator Terna has hired Spanish bank Santander to scout investors that could plow cash into its transmission businesses in Brazil, Peru and Uruguay, four sources familiar with the matter told Reuters. Terna could raise 200 million to 300 million euros from the process, two of the sources said. The process kicked off recently and aims to raise funds to help Terna strengthen its footprint in Latin America, the sources said. Terna and Santander declined to comment. Italy’s state-controlled power transmitter ranks as one of the world’s biggest power grid players with a market value of 10 billion euros ($11.4 billion). But it heavily relies on the Italian market where it makes most of its money from returns set by the regulator to help it improve the country’s high voltage transmission grid. As part of its diversification push, Terna is looking to non-regulated businesses and international developments where investments could command fatter returns, fuelling earnings and dividend payments. Terna counts State Grid Corporation of China as its second-biggest shareholder, after state lender Cassa Depositi e Prestiti. One of the sources described South America as a “good platform to boost growth”. The Rome-based company has concessions to develop power transmission lines in Brazil, Uruguay and Peru where it has pledged to invest around 245 million euros to 2022. It recently unveiled a new 158 km power line in Brazil to carry power produced from wind farms in the south of the country into the national grid. With over 80 percent of electricity produced from green sources and wind production on the rise, Brazil is seen as one of the world’s top energy markets. “Early days but there’s been a lot of interest in the Brazilian assets,” said another source familiar with the matter. In its 2018-2022 business plan unveiled last year, Terna said it expected to generate an estimated 150 million euros in core earnings from international operations, primarily in Latin America."

We will continue to monitor the market closely and will seek to exercise call options where we believe it is right to do so,” Santander said in a statement. Santander’s contingent convertible (CoCo) was eligible to be called on Tuesday and recent confusion over whether the Spanish lender would redeem the bond had caused wild swings in the bond’s price.

After the markets closed on Tuesday Santander’s 6.25 percent perpetual Additional Tier 1 bond was down 1.6 cents to 96.8 cents according to Tradeweb Data. Some institutional investors said they were not worried about a potential knock-on effect on other European lenders. “In fact it is a good sign of the market maturing that we get instances of bonds extending as this is the point of the structure and it should be focused on economic rationale, not reputational risk,” said Steve Hussey, head of financial institutions credit research, at Alliance Bernstein in London. Bankers also warned that the non-call puts a spotlight on how these AT1s are structured going forward. “Do institutional investors prefer a more discrete call structure, where the AT1 bonds is then not callable for another five years, or the Santander format which has quarterly calls?” said Kapil Damani, head of capital products at BNP Paribas. If there is uncertainty over when such bonds will be called this could make it more expensive for banks to issue them as investors will demand a higher premium for bearing the risk. However, while Santander’s own $1.2 billion capital bond - issued on Feb. 6 - fell in price, other bonds of the same structure from other European banks had not reacted to the news.

4.861911182584587," RPT-Santander keeps investors guessing over CoCo bond redemption (Repeats FEB 8 story, no change to text) LONDON, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Uncertainty over whether Santander, Spain’s largest bank, will redeem a bond in the coming days, is raising questions about a market banks use frequently to fund their capital requirements. Santander is yet to inform investors whether it will “call” a 1.5 billion euro Additional Tier 1 bond, known as a contingent convertible (CoCo), ahead of a February 12 deadline, causing confusion in a market accustomed to banks repaying investors at the first opportunity. CoCo bonds were introduced in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis to ensure that bond investors as well as shareholders bear losses if a bank runs into difficulty before any taxpayer cash is needed. These bonds are often called “hybrid” as they convert into equity if a bank’s capital level falls below a certain threshold. On paper the bonds have no maturity date, but banks get an option to redeem them after a fixed period - usually six years - and until now banks have almost always “called” them as soon as possible. Santander’s bond is eligible to be called on February 12 but the bank has not yet said what it plans to do, causing wild swings in the bond’s price. It was last trading at a cash price of 98.87, translating to a yield of 9.72 percent, having dropped as low as 93.8 in January, with a yield of 45 percent. For an interactive version of the below price chart, click here tmsnrt.rs/2tcKhmr. A Santander spokeswoman told Reuters the bank would tell the market its decision before February 12, and that the final decision on whether it would roll-over or call the bond would be based on “economic terms.” Santander’s decision could have wider ramifications for the CoCo market as many bonds are due to be called this year. If there is uncertainty over when such bonds will be called this will make it more expensive for banks to issue them as investors will demand a higher premium for bearing the risk. Globally, about $13.5 billion equivalent worth of CoCos are redeemable this year, around $8.4 billion of which are from European banks, according to Reuters calculations based on Refinitiv Eikon data. For an interactive version of the below chart, click here tmsnrt.rs/2BqCtSl “This is the first time we have really seen a bank that’s not in any kind of stress really think about not calling an AT1 bond,” said Tom Kinmonth, a fixed income strategist at ABN Amro. “Regardless of whether they do so (call) or not now, it does raise questions about this market,” he said, pointing out that Santander has a redemption date on another CoCo coming up in May this year. Other banks with upcoming call dates on CoCos include Lloyds 1.48 billion pound CoCo redeemable in June, Barclays’ 1.076 billion euro CoCo redeemable in September and CIBC’s 1 billion Canadian dollar redeemable in October, according to Refinitiv Eikon data. Funding costs are rising right across the banking sector, partly as a result of central bank actions to wind down stimulus programmes. As a result, it could become more tempting for banks not to call their bonds. “As credit spreads move wider, the economic justification to refinance changes,” said one banker who has sold Cocos on behalf of Santander in the past. For example, Santander’s 1.5 billion euro CoCo will reset at a spread of 541 basis points over five-year mid-swaps. The cost of issuing a new bond may be higher. The bank’s outstanding CoCos callable in September 2023 and carrying a coupon of 5.25 percent were trading on Friday at 688 basis points over mid-swaps, according to Tradeweb data. Santander has recently issued a new dollar-denominated CoCo, raising $1.2 billion, sparking speculation the proceeds would be used to call the 1.5 billion euro bond coming due. A banker who arranges debt sales for European banks said the uncertainty created by Santander meant investors would have to reassess how to estimate fair value on capital issuance from all banks. “Even if they (Santander) end up calling the bond, investors will now have to take into account the possibility of this debt existing in perpetuity,” this banker said."
5.511220290046191," Santander still talking to Orcel, profit lifted by Brazil MADRID (Reuters) - Spain's Santander SAN.MC said on Wednesday it is still in contact with Andrea Orcel, the Italian banker seeking compensation after the bank withdrew an offer to make him its chief executive, but would stick with its existing CEO. Santander has come under scrutiny after saying this month that Orcel would not take over as CEO as it would not meet his pay expectations, raising questions about the hiring process. Ana Botin, chairman of the euro zone’s biggest bank by market value, said Santander’s board had reached a decision not to proceed with hiring Orcel after a “very rigorous internal corporate governance process”. Speaking to reporters after Santander reported a rise in fourth quarter net profit, Botin declined to comment on any possible compensation deal, adding “we had reasons to make the offer, to announce it early because of regulatory reasons”. Orcel, who had left Swiss bank UBS UBSG.S to take the job, had been appointed in September last year. He is now awaiting a compensation offer from Santander to cover lost future earnings, a source familiar with the matter has told Reuters. Ana Botin, who took over as head of the bank after the death of her father Emilio Botin in 2014, said that Jose Antonio Alvarez will remain Santander chief executive “indefinitely”. Earlier, Santander reported that fourth quarter net profit rose 34 percent to 2.07 billion euros ($2.37 billion) from the same period a year earlier, boosted by Brazil and higher net interest income. That compared with a 4 percent rise in net profit from the previous quarter. “Latin America has remained an important engine for growth within the group, with especially strong progress in Brazil and Mexico,” Botin said in a statement. Santander shares turned negative in midday trading after outperforming the overall market earlier, falling 2.02 percent at 1323 GMT and leading losses on a weaker Ibex .IBEX. “Core revenue trends look positive but partially offset by higher costs and while capital rose it was a touch below our estimate,” Jefferies said in a research note, adding that quarterly net profit was 8 percent above consensus. Santander said its net interest income, a measure of earnings on loans minus deposit costs, rose 8.5 percent from the previous quarter to 9.06 billion euros. NII for the full year was 34.34 billion euros, virtually unchanged from 2017. Net profit in the fourth quarter rose by 1.4 percent from the previous three-month period to 663 million euros in Brazil, which is Santander’s largest market, while net profit for the whole of 2018 jumped 22.3 percent. In Mexico, net profit rose 8 percent in the fourth quarter to 206 million euros. Net profit in Spain reached 432 million euros in the fourth quarter, down 18 percent from the third quarter on the back of regular contributions to the country’s deposit guarantee fund. Compared with a year earlier, fourth quarter net profit in Spain rose 30.9 percent. In Britain, fourth quarter net profit rose 3.8 percent to 286 million euros from the year before. Botin said the bank was prepared for all possible outcomes of Britain’s departure from the European Union and held one more year of currency hedges. Overall Santander posted an 18 percent jump in its full-year profit which rose to 7.81 billion euros, from 6.62 billion euros a year earlier.

6.125413452492731," Spain's Santander drops Orcel as next CEO, blames pay gap MADRID (Reuters) - Banco Santander SAN.MC said on Tuesday that Italian banker Andrea Orcel would not take over as chief executive after it could not meet his pay expectations, in a rare and unusual U-turn on such a high-level appointment. Jose Antonio Alvarez will now stay on as CEO instead of Orcel, who previously worked for Swiss bank UBS UBSG.S and was appointed to the role at Spain's largest bank in September. “The cost to Santander of compensating Mr Orcel for the deferred awards he has earned over the past seven years, and other benefits previously awarded to him, would be a sum significantly above the board’s original expectations at the time of the appointment,” Santander said in a statement. Santander did not mention any figures and did not say how big the pay gap was. But three sources with knowledge of the matter told Reuters the deferred payment amounted to 50 million euros ($56.98 million) or more. One of the sources also said there were issues about Orcel’s start date and non-competition clauses. Santander, also the euro zone’s largest bank by market value, said at the time of Orcel’s appointment in September that it would be effective in early 2019 following regulatory approvals. “The Board of Santander had agreed the terms of his annual remuneration in his future role at Santander, which were in line with that of Jose Antonio Alvarez,” Santander said on Tuesday. “It was not, however, possible, to determine in advance the final cost of the Group’s share of compensating Mr Orcel for the remuneration awards, made to him by his previous employer, that would have been foregone.” Orcel did not immediately return requests for comment. He is on gardening leave and is technically still an employee of UBS until the end of a six-month notice period. He had been head of UBS Group’s investment banking business since 2014 and a member of the bank’s executive board since 2012. UBS said: “This is a matter between Andrea Orcel and Santander. UBS applied the compensation plan rules relevant in such cases and made them transparent to all parties before any decisions were made.” Orcel worked at Bank of America Merrill Lynch BAC.N between 1992 and 2012. Both Bank of America Merrill Lynch and UBS have advised Santander on many corporate moves. Santander also said that Rodrigo Echenique, due to retire from his current role as chairman of Santander Spain in March, would remain until a successor is named."

Shares in Santander, the euro zone’s biggest bank by market value, rose 4 percent on Wednesday, against a 1.5 percent rise on the European STOXX banking index. Analysts welcomed the bank’s results at home in Spain and solid underlying performing in Brazil, as well as a recovery in Britain and its capacity to improve its capital ratios. “Overall, this set of results seems to mean that the recovery remains on track, driven by a stronger Spain and the improvement in a surprisingly resilient UK,” BBVA said in a note. Santander’s diversification overseas, especially in Brazil, has helped the bank cope with tough conditions faced by its European rivals since the onset of the financial crisis. Santander reported a net profit of 1.99 billion euros ($2.3 billion) in the July-September period. Analysts expected a net profit of 1.92 billion euros. At a time when regulators are demanding banks hold more capital, Santander managed to increase its fully-loaded core capital ratio, a closely watched measure of a bank’s strength, by 31 basis points to 11.11 percent, above its own target of 11 percent for the end of the year. “Capital generation was stronger than expected, due to a combination of organic capital generation and lower risk weighted assets,” Goldman Sachs said in a note to analysts. However, its capital ratio is still below its European peers that are subject to stress tests, the results of which will be released on Friday. Including, the sale of its Wizink credit business its fully loaded ratio would have finished September at 11.20 percent. In Brazil, where Santander generates more than a quarter of its income, net profit in the quarter dropped 6.1 percent from a year ago after the country’s currency depreciated. Without the currency impact in Brazil, net profit in the quarter jumped 16.7 percent, boosted by solid growth in business volumes. In Spain, its second-biggest market, net profit almost tripled partially due to a positive contribution from the Banco Popular acquisition and favourable comparison against the same period last year when it had to book one-off charges. The bottom line in Spain, where it increased its market share to 17 percent from 15 percent from the second to third quarter, was also underpinned by a 75 percent increase in trading income. The lender posted a loss of 169 million euros in the quarter in its Argentina market, where the bank makes 1 percent of its net profit, due to hyperinflation in the country. In Britain, its third-largest market, net profit rose 2.1 percent, while profits in the United States rose 34 percent.

5.74467046668321," Dividend windfall: Santander latest target in Germany's giant fraud probe FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Spain's Santander SAN.MC is the latest bank to be caught up in Germany's biggest post-war fraud investigation involving a share-trading scheme that the authorities say cost taxpayers billions of euros. In June, prosecutors in Cologne opened a tax investigation into Santander, confidential documents relating to a state prosecutors’ investigation seen by Reuters and other European news organizations reveal for the first time. Santander's role in the scheme was to carry out trades, the prosecutors say, as one of many parties involved. They are also looking at Australia's Macquarie Bank MQG.AX and Germany's Deutsche Bank, DBKGn.DE as part of the broader investigation.   A letter from prosecutors to Santander’s lawyers sent on June 4 shows that they suspect the bank of having “planned and executed trades” that facilitated “severe tax evasion” from 2007 through 2011. A Santander spokesman said that the bank was “fully cooperating” with German authorities and conducting its own internal investigation. The bank “doesn’t tolerate behavior” that fails to comply with the rules and laws in the market where it operates, he said, adding “if our investigations do identify misconduct, we will take appropriate action.” Reuters spoke to bankers, officials and people directly involved in the probe and reviewed thousands of pages of internal bank files, correspondence and legal papers obtained as part of a European media investigation called the “cum-ex files” coordinated by non-profit newsroom Correctiv. The prosecutors say the players in the cum-ex scheme misled the German government into thinking a stock had multiple owners on its dividend payday who were each owed a dividend and a dividend tax credit. The prosecutors say the scheme was illegal and misled the government into paying tax refunds. A spokesman for Santander declined to comment on whether it had broken the law while a spokesman for Macquarie, which is also under investigation, said it had believed the practice to be legal. The documents show that the Cologne prosecutors closed in on Santander and other banks this year as the investigation, which began in April 2013, rapidly accelerated. The models were designed to generate multiple tax rebates, prosecutors say. In essence, here is how it worked, according to the documents viewed by Reuters: A bank would agree to sell a company stock, for example to a pension fund, before the dividend payout but delivered it after it had been paid. The bank and the fund would both reclaim withholding tax. Sometimes banks sold shares they did not own and agreed to buy them later in a practice known as short selling. The stock was traded rapidly around a syndicate of banks, investors and hedge funds to create the impression of numerous owners, prosecutors say. The profits from the deals were shared. To generate bigger profits, the pensions funds could also buy large volumes of stocks, using loans from banks. The German tax office wrote to the Cologne prosecutors to say there were “concrete indications” that Santander had acted as a short seller. Three pension funds had also used loans from Macquarie, people with direct knowledge of the matter say. “Macquarie will continue to cooperate fully with the German authorities,” a Macquarie spokesman said. “It has already resolved its two other matters involving German dividend trading that took place between 2006 and 2009.” The spokesman declined to say how they were resolved. Similar investigations have been opened in Frankfurt and Munich, but Cologne, whose prosecutors specialize in international tax crime, made a breakthrough when at least six people involved in the trading gave detailed evidence, according to the documents. Other banks, including Unicredit’s German arm, have acknowledged they were also involved in such trading. A spokeswoman for UniCredit CRDI.MI said its German unit had been involved in cum-ex trading but that all criminal proceedings had since been terminated after, among other things, the payment of fines. She declined to comment further. A spokesman for Deutsche Bank said it had not participated in an “organized cum-ex market” but that it had been “involved in some of its clients’ cum-ex transactions.” It said it was cooperating with the authorities. Referring to all the banks involved, Norbert Walter-Borjans, the former finance minister of North Rhine-Westphalia, which includes Cologne, said: “They grabbed the kitty that had been paid for by ordinary tax payers.” “It is clear that it was against the law...How can it be legal to get something back twice or three times that has been paid only once?” he said. According to the prosecutors, the scheme was promoted by German tax inspector-turned-tax adviser Hanno Berger and others. He advised Macquarie on cum-ex trading, according to a letter seen by Reuters which was sent by Berger to a Macquarie employee in March 2008. Berger told Reuters he also provided advice to Macquarie on the scheme in later years but he said he was not paid for it. The Macquarie spokesman declined to comment on Berger or the letter. Macquarie said last month its incoming and outgoing chief executives are expected to be named as suspects by prosecutors. The pair were aware of the reputational risk to the bank of the trades, the documents show. Berger, the central suspect in the investigation who is living in exile in the Swiss Alps, said the banks used a legitimate loophole, which was closed in 2012, and did not break the law. “They (the German state) cannot punish others for their mistakes,” he told Reuters. Some German officials and prosecutors refute this claim, noting that Germany made attempts to stamp out the practice by changing and clarifying the law in 2007, 2009 and 2012. One top German official, who asked not to be named, said those efforts made clear the trading was illegal. German authorities estimate the scheme cost the state 5.6 billion euros in tax rebates that should never have been paid, while some experts believe the damage could be 10 billion euros. The state prosecutor in Cologne declined to comment. “REPUTATIONAL RISK” The documents show that the prosecutors in Cologne made a major breakthrough last year when a group of bankers, including a former Macquarie employee, offered information that showed Santander, Macquarie and others profited from the scheme. Macquarie estimates that it may have to pay 100 million euros in total legal settlements from the trades, roughly half of which it has already paid, according to a person with knowledge of the matter. Internal Macquarie emails show that outgoing CEO Nicholas Moore and his successor in waiting, Shemara Wikramanayake, were aware of the reputational risks of the trades and involved in discussions about the funding. A spokesman for Macquarie said Moore and Wikramanayake would not comment. In October 2010, Wikramanayake and three other executives sent a memorandum seen by Reuters to Macquarie’s board of directors. It outlined a funding opportunity that would earn Macquarie between 15 and 20 million euros on each of three 1.1 billion euro loan facilities. It earned a fee for these loan facilities. “There is a risk that German revenue authorities may seek to deny tax reclaims and take some other action against the parties involved,” they wrote. They said the “anticipated returns” should be weighed against the negative “reputational risk”. Wikramanayake and Moore attended part of a meeting of directors on October 28 2010 in Sydney, when the deals and the “reputation risk” were discussed, according to minutes of the meeting seen by Reuters. The conditional approval for the funding was given at that meeting before the formal signoff in early 2011, according to the documents. The Macquarie spokesman said the bank lent money to a group of investment funds in 2011 which traded shares that sought to “obtain the benefit of dividend withholding tax credits” but he said the German authorities refused those claims. The German authorities declined to comment. “Macquarie received extensive external legal advice in relation to its involvement and believed that it was acting lawfully,” he said. Prosecutors wrote in letters to Santander’s lawyers that they believe the Spanish bank, and its UK subsidiary Abbey National Treasury Services, were actively involved in “a large number” of deals involving short sales - a critical part of the cycle that created the impression of multiple share owners. The Santander spokesman said that to the bank’s understanding, the investigation was focused on three former employees. “To date we have not identified any evidence that the activities under investigation involved senior management or that any of Santander’s or its subsidiaries’ governing bodies were aware of these activities,” said the spokesman. The bank executed transactions for a number of U.S. pension funds and its customer Macquarie, prosecutors said, which allowed the funds to make what tax investigators say are “illicit” tax reclaims. The prosecutors do not say how many pension funds. Those services were lucrative for both Santander and Macquarie, the documents show. For example, on May 13, 2011, the New York-based Sander Gerber pension plan received dividends of almost 162 million euros as a result of the trades supported by the two banks, according to the documents. Macquarie charged a fee of 4 percent, or 6.5 million euros, to the pension plan for its services. Santander received an additional 400,000 euros in fees for the ‘futures facility’ it provided. A spokesman for Sander Gerber said that its investment decision relied on the “reputation and integrity” of the banks and that Gerber had understood the investment products to be “legitimate”. Germany wants the banks to repay the 5.6 billion euros, the German official told Reuters. Banks have already repaid 2.3 billion euros in settlements, the official said. Frankfurt prosecutors this year filed the first criminal charges against Berger and five others who are all former employees of the German unit of Unicredit, according to court documents seen by Reuters. Unicredit declined to comment. Although the investigation has gathered pace and some of the banks have repaid money, pursuing them and other suspects has been difficult, some lawmakers say. This is because, like Berger, several have moved abroad. One German prosecutor admitted it would take years to bring those involved to justice but that the prosecution sent a clear signal that such wrongdoing would not be tolerated."

-14.073155828650371," Santander profits take hit from Banco Popular costs MADRID (Reuters) - Banco Santander's SAN.MC net profit was hit by one-off restructuring costs from its acquisition of troubled Banco Popular, which offset otherwise solid underlying second-quarter results from Spain's biggest bank. The bank - which took over Banco Popular in June 2017 - reported a net profit of 1.7 billion euros in the April to June period, down 3 percent from a year earlier. Analysts had expected net profit to come in at 1.65 billion euros, according to a Reuters poll. The results included restructuring costs of 300 million euros ($350.3 million) related to Popular. Santander has said it expects total restructuring costs of around 1.3 billion euros linked to the Popular deal. Excluding restructuring costs, underlying net profit in the quarter was up 14 percent, boosted by a robust performance in its largest market, Brazil. Santander’s diversification overseas, especially in Brazil, has helped the bank to cope with tough conditions for banks in Europe in the years since the financial crisis. In Brazil, where the bank makes more than a quarter of its profits, net profit rose 6.1 percent from a year ago, boosted by solid growth in business volumes. In Spain, its second-biggest market, net profit fell more than 80 percent on Popular-related charges. In Britain, its third-largest market, net profit fell 8.8 percent, partly due to ongoing competitive pressure on income and costs related to regulation and digital projects. Profits in the United States rose 41 percent. Santander's shares were up 0.5 percent on Wednesday, against a 0.2 percent rise on the European STOXX banking index .SX7P. Analysts said results were solid but also highlighted that capital ratios remained below European peers. “Geographically, UK/Latam/US came better. The miss on capital and questions about sustainability of Brazil’s performance might temper the share price reaction,” UBS said in a note to clients. Santander ended the quarter with a fully-loaded core capital ratio, a closely watched measure of a bank’s strength, of 10.8 percent, compared with 11 percent in the previous quarter. The capital reduction followed the elimination of excess capital from minority interests in its U.S. business and a 12 basis point reduction related to the valuation of the held-for-sale portfolio in the quarter. Net interest income, a measure of earnings on loans minus deposit costs, was 8.47 billion euros, down 1.5 percent from the second quarter of last year. Analysts had forecast a NII of 8.4 billion euros Like its European rivals, Santander is struggling to lift earnings from loans in Spain with interest rates hovering at historic lows and rising competition eroding margins. However, lending income was up 0.3 percent against the previous quarter thanks to the contribution from Popular, which helped NII to rise 25 percent against the same quarter of last year in its Spanish home market. Santander was confident of achieving its 2018 goals and those laid out in its 3-year plan, Santander Chairman Ana Botin said in a statement. The bank also managed to cut its non-performing loan ratio at group level to 3.92 percent from 4.02 percent in a sign that Spanish banks are cleaning up their balance sheets faster than rivals in Italy thanks to Spain’s solid economic recovery."
-1.6401776534655286," Santander among potential buyers for SocGen's Polish bank: sources WARSAW (Reuters) - Santander SAN.MC is on a list of potential buyers of Societe Generale's SOGN.PA Polish business Eurobank, two banking industry sources said. Reuters reported earlier this month that SocGen was exploring a sale of Eurobank, given increasing competitive pressures on the business. ""Santander BZ WBK BZW.WA will be in the game,"" a senior banking industry source said, adding that Credit Agricole CAGR.PA was also interested as the French bank tries to decide whether to expand or pull out of Poland. Another source also confirmed Santander's interest. Two other sources said Credit Agricole was interested in Eurobank, and one of them valued the potential deal at several hundred million zlotys. One of these sources also pointed to Portugal's Millennium BCP.LS as a potential buyer. Societe Generale, Credit Agricole, Santander, and Millennium bcp declined to comment. Eurobank is the 17th largest Polish bank with assets of 14billion zlotys ($3.77 billion), and is more than 20 times smaller than the country's biggest bank PKO BP PKO.WA. Last year, it made a net profit of 103 million zlotys. The sale of Eurobank would reinforce a broader trend ofconsolidation in Poland’s banking sector, which has accelerated in the past few years as the ruling eurosceptic Law and Justice(PiS) has party encouraged domestic ownership. Earlier this year, BNP Paribas's BNPP.PA Polish business BGZ BNP Paribas agreed to buy Raiffeisen's RBIV.VI Polish bank, while several months earlier Santander's BZ WBK signed a deal to buy some assets of the Polish division of Deutsche Bank DBKGn.DE. Last year, state-run entities bought Poland's second largest bank Pekao SA PEO.WA from Italy's UniCredit CRDI.MICRDI.WA. Pekao in turn is looking at whether to merge with another state-run Polish lender - Alior Bank ALRR.WA. A senior banking executive in Poland said that a number of smaller banks in the country would be soon up for sale as historically low interest rates makes it difficult for them to boost returns and they lack scale to compete with bigger players. He also pointed to certain other Polish banks, which are currently being restructured, as potential sale candidates once their finances have improved. Analysts and bankers predict that Poland will end up with just five major banking groups."
-14.631635941609442," Santander's profits up 10 percent as Brazil offsets UK weakness MADRID (Reuters) - Banco Santander's SAN.MC solid performance in its main market Brazil helped the bank produce a slightly better-than-expected 10 percent rise in first-quarter net profit, offsetting weakness in its UK business. Santander's Latin American business has allowed the bank to cope with a squeeze on lending margins in Europe that is pressuring its rivals in Spain, such as BBVA BBVA.MC and Caixabank CABK.MC. In Brazil, where the bank makes more than a quarter of its profits, net profit rose 7 percent from a year ago, boosted by solid loan growth. But in Britain, its third-biggest market, profit fell 23 percent, as impairment losses rose to 60 million pounds in its global corporate banking business. This was mainly due to an additional charge for one customer, which moved to non-performance in 2017, as well as an impairment charge for a 2018 drawdown related to the collapse of British construction firm Carillion CLLN.L. Santander, the euro zone’s biggest bank by market value, made a net profit of 2.05 billion euros ($2.5 billion) in the first three months of the year, from 1.87 billion euros a year ago. Analysts had forecast 2.01 billion euros in a Reuters poll. Net interest income (NII), a measure of earnings on loans minus deposit costs, was 8.45 billion euros, up 0.6 percent from a year ago but down 1.8 percent against the previous quarter. Analysts had expected a NII of 8.49 billion. Santander's shares were the biggest fallers on Spain's leading index Ibex-35 .IBEX with a 2.0 percent decline. They were also one of the biggest fallers on Europe's STOXX banking index .SX7P at 0945 CET. In the last month, Santander shares had gained 7 percent. Analysts said results were mostly in line and highlighted a strong performance in Latin America and the United States, but weaker than expected core revenues in the UK. Analysts at Deutsche Bank said Brazil remained a bright spot for the bank. “Overall, the results support our thesis of Brazil being the growth engine for the bank, more than offsetting the pressures seen elsewhere in Spain and the UK,” they said in a note. Executive chairman Ana Botin said the year had started well, with the group generating double-digit profit growth driven by strong results in Brazil, Spain and Mexico, and improved performance in the United States. In the United States, net profit rose 32 percent. Santander recently said it was confident its U.S. business would achieve “significant” profit growth over the next few years as it continues to optimize its capital structure. Spain became the bank’s second-biggest market in the first quarter after it consolidated Popular into its accounts in the third quarter after taking it over in June. Net profit in Spain rose 26 percent, though NII remained under pressure versus the previous quarter due to low interest rates. Also in the first quarter, Santander completed its agreement with U.S. private equity company Blackstone to transfer 51 percent of Popular’s toxic real estate portfolio and said it would continue to reduce its real estate exposure in the coming quarters. Following this deal, its exposure fell to 5.2 billion euros. As with other Spanish banks, Santander has taken advantage of a rebound in the Spanish property market to tackle toxic balance sheets faster than rivals in Italy.. Santander reaffirmed its 2018 targets such as achieving double-digit earnings per share growth. It ended the first quarter with a fully-loaded core capital ratio, a closely watched measure of a bank’s strength, of 11 percent, compared to 10.84 in the previous quarter, and in line with its target for 2018."
