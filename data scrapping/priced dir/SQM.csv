-5.163516050477817," Chilean lithium miner SQM says relations with indigenous communities are improving SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chilean company SQM, the world’s second largest lithium producer, has a priority commitment to the indigenous communities surrounding the Atacama salt flat, the firm’s General Manager Ricardo Ramos said in an interview. According to the interview, published on Sunday in the newspaper La Tercera, the company is making progress in improving relations with the communities that live in that area of the arid Chilean north through several cooperation deals. SQM cut a deal with Chile in 2018 allowing it to ramp up output from the Atacama, a remote and fragile desert salt flat whose indigenous inhabitants fear may be jeopardized by mining. SQM promised up to $15 million annually to promote sustainable development in the communities. But the funds have spawned fresh controversy as a key indigenous association has rejected them, saying they are a distraction from ensuring the environment is protected. “We are progressing well. Commitment to the communities is a priority,” Ramos said in the interview. SQM emailed a link to the interview to the media on Sunday without any further statements on the issue. Reuters was not immediately able to reach the indigenous communities for comment. The agreements allow “the development of a new form of relationship that, based on mutual recognition and respect (...) directly addresses concerns and community perceptions,” he said. The standoff has underscored the complex calculations thatminers like SQM, which have for decades operated in far-flung regions, must now navigate as foreign governments, carmakers and consumers scrutinize their social and environmental bonafidesahead of the boom in electric vehicle sales.

-4.247788447282787," Inside lithium giant SQM's struggle to win over indigenous communities in Chile's Atacama SANTIAGO (Reuters) - SQM , the world’s No. 2 lithium producer, cut a deal with Chile in 2018 that allowed it to ramp up output from the Atacama, a remote and fragile desert salt flat whose indigenous inhabitants fear may be jeopardized by mining. When the deal was struck, the Chilean miner promised up to $15 million annually to promote “sustainable development” in those communities. However, instead of easing tensions between the miner and the locals, the funds have spawned fresh controversy as a key indigenous association has rejected them, saying they are a distraction from ensuring the environment is protected, whilst calling for the deal to annulled because it did not consult with the indigenous first. . The spat has left both SQM and the government - responsible for distributing the funds which now total about $25.3 million - in a bind, according to a Reuters review of regulatory filings, together with interviews with SQM, indigenous leaders and Chilean authorities. The standoff underscores the complex calculations that miners like SQM, which have for decades operated in far-flung regions, must now navigate as foreign governments, carmakers and consumers scrutinize their social and environmental bonafides ahead of the boom in electric vehicle sales. A group of high-level officials and ministers met twice in 2020 to discuss the best way to deliver the funds despite the politically-powerful umbrella group, the Atacama Indigenous Council’s (CPA) intransigence, according to documents obtained by Reuters under Chile’s Transparency Act. In June, officials agreed to seek deals with each individual community, circumventing the CPA, the documents show. But three years since it signed the initial agreement with SQM, Chile development agency Corfo, which handles the negotiations, has yet to ink a single deal with the communities, the agency told Reuters. “SQM is more worried about its image than its environmental commitments,” Sergio Cubillos, CPA’s president, told Reuters. “This is about more than just about money.” SQM rejects Cubillos’s claims that it gives short shrift to the environment. It points to a plan announced in October to immediately slash its use of freshwater and brine, and to produce carbon neutral lithium by 2030. “SICK PATIENT” On the salt flat, relentless sun evaporates brine pumped from beneath the ground into a concentrate rich in lithium. SQM’s process prefers sunlight over mechanical power - a major selling point for electric automakers keen on eliminating emissions from supply chains. But the native communities that ring the Atacama worry that mining may be depleting scarce freshwater and lithium-rich brine, reducing its availability for people and wildlife. Cubillos calls the salt flat a “sick patient,” suffering from years of mining, but said more studies were needed to determine “how advanced the illness is.” Concerns over the science are gaining traction. In 2019, an environmental court sided with the CPA, demanding SQM overhaul a remediation plan following charges it over-pumped brine. A government water study due in February could help shed light on these questions. SQM has put its daily water and brine extraction data online to help alleviate those concerns. It has also continued its push to work together with the communities, according to Gonzalo Guerrero, who heads SQM’s board commission devoted to these issues. He told Reuters the company had even offered to underwrite projects to help communities combat the COVID-19 pandemic. “We neither received a response, not even the opportunity to present (the projects) to the communities,” Guerrero said. The miner has nonetheless struck cooperation agreements with three of the 18 communities, and expects to sign at least four more by March, Guerrero said. At least one of its partner communities, Toconao, has praised SQM’s commitment to reduce their impact, saying the measures “pointed in the right direction,” according to a filing viewed by Reuters. Cubillos, whose term as president of the CPA expires on Jan. 18, declined to comment on these agreements, but said his group would “not accept money in exchange for the subsistence of our people.” The CPA will next week vote on a new president, but sources close to the group said its policies had endured multiple presidencies and were unlikely to change. While the spat is unlikely to put SQM´s contract or output immediately at risk, it could threaten to overshadow the company’s efforts to reduce its environmental and emissions impacts, says Alex Grant, of consultancy Jade Cove Partners. If SQM cannot obtain an “unequivocal social license” to operate from stakeholders, then some battery makers could opt to buy from suppliers with a larger carbon footprint, but a more transparent social or governance report card, to avoid the stigma. “All these things are inter-connected,” Grant said. Failure to find a solution could add to supply chain concerns ahead of an expected electric vehicle boom that early last year prompted Volkswagen and Daimler to launch a study to push for more “sustainable” lithium mining in Chile. Alonso Barros, an attorney who has spent decades working with indigenous communities in northern Chile, said voluntary measures taken by SQM to slash its use of water and brine were proof pressure from indigenous and carmakers was already making a mark. “This is much more than (regulators) could otherwise have forced SQM to do,” Barros said."
8.473891925020146," Chile finance minister lashes out at lithium miner SQM top shareholder Julio Ponce -TV interview SANTIAGO, Dec 30 (Reuters) - Chilean Finance Minister Ignacio Briones said in a television interview Wednesday that Julio Ponce, a principal shareholder of SQM, the world’s second largest lithium producer, “would be in jail” had a case of illicit trading brought against him in Chile been conducted in the United States. Chile’s stock market regulator in 2014 fined Ponce, then chairman of SQM and former son-in-law of late dictator Augusto Pinochet, nearly $70 million for his role in a market manipulation scandal known locally as the “Caso Cascadas.” Ponce appealed that fine - then the largest ever handed down by the Chilean regulator - in a lower court and won. The lower court slashed the penalty to less than $3 million, a decision upheld by the country’s Supreme Court in October. Finance Minister Briones said in an interview on Chilean television program Stock Disponible that the fines would have been far stiffer in a country like the United States. “It’s not my role to second guess the court’s decisions... but if you were to ask me, this case, in the United States, what would have happened? He’d be in jail,” Briones said of Ponce. Both SQM and Ponce’s attorney declined to comment on Briones’ statement. Briones said on the television program such corruption cases undermined Chile’s democracy. “I think these cases generate a sense of inequality before the law, and that is awful for our democracy,” Briones said. The South American nation, a top lithium and copper producer, last year saw mass protests against inequality that led to a referendum vote in October in favor of rewriting the constitution. The Cascadas case caused an uproar in Chile long before the 2019 protests, shaking investor confidence in a nation long lauded for low levels of corruption. In a separate and unrelated case in 2017, the U.S. Department of Justice fined SQM more than $15 million in connection with payments to “politically-connected” individuals in Chile, a violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. No one was jailed in that case. (Reporting by Dave Sherwood; Editing by David Gregorio)"
8.521296294110364," Chile's SQM begins process to raise capital, boost lithium output SANTIAGO, Dec 23 (Reuters) - Chile´s SQM said on Wednesday its board of directors agreed to begin the process of raising $1.1 billion in capital through the sale of common stock to help underwrite an ambitious expansion of its lithium, nitrate and iodine operations. The world´s No. 2 lithium producer said in a statement it would call an extraordinary shareholders meeting on Jan. 22 to green-light a proposal to issue 22.4 million of the company´s series B shares. If approved, the capital will help finance its previously announced $1.9 billion, four-year investment plan, which aims to more than double its capacity to produce lithium carbonate in Chile to 180,000 tonnes annually from 70,000 tonnes. Lithium is a key ingredient in the batteries that power cellphones and electric vehicles. SQM said in the statement that funds might also be put toward its Mount Holland lithium project in Australia. A final investment decision on that project is slated for the first quarter of 2021, the statement said. Many miners had announced plans to boost output of lithium ahead of an expected spike in demand. But the COVID-19 pandemic temporarily slammed the brakes on the electric vehicle revolution, driving down prices, denting profits and forcing many companies to shelve expansion plans. SQM said, however, it would push forward with its own expansion despite the pandemic, fueled by a steady increase of its sales volumes in 2020. The company said it believed the lithium market would expand long-term by 20% a year, reaching 800,000 to 1 million metric tons by 2025."

22.560036526998754," Exclusive: Lithium giants Albemarle and SQM battle over access to Atacama water study SANTIAGO (Reuters) - U.S.-based Albemarle Corp, the world’s largest lithium producer, has accused its top rival, Chilean miner SQM, and local regulators of seeking to keep secret a coveted report about the environmental impact of lithium mining in Chile’s Salar de Atacama, according to a filing made by its lawyers. Chilean regulator Corfo, which oversees lithium mining in the Atacama, in August denied a request from Albemarle ALB.N to review the long-awaited report, according to filings obtained by Reuters under Chile's Transparency Act. In the filings, Corfo told Albemarle it was unable to provide the report because it was still under review and contained confidential business information. The report, which remains under wraps, aims to stamp out uncertainty over the sustainability of mining activity that has long cast a pall over the sensitive salt flat, home to one-quarter of the world’s current output of lithium, but also indigenous communities, protected areas, and endangered flamingos. Both SQM and Albemarle, the only two lithium miners on the flat, contributed to the report. But whereas SQM’s contract with Corfo allows it to review working drafts of studies commissioned by the agency and related to water in the Salar, Albemarle’s contract does not include this clause. SQM SQMB.SN objected to the study's release, the filings show, arguing the data it contained was ""sensitive and confidential."" Albemarle blasted Corfo’s decision in an August appeal presented to Chile’s Council for Transparency and seen by Reuters, calling the study long-overdue, and its contents public. The council resolves disputes related to the country’s open records laws. “Their only goal is to hide information that is, in no way, secret,” Albemarle’s attorney said in the filing, adding that the study in question was “highly relevant” to understanding the environmental effects of mining on the flat. It said the only reason the contents might be sensitive was if they “revealed non-compliance or actions that go against regulations” and said SQM’s exclusive right to review the study was unfair and put its top competitor in a “position of privilege.” Corfo declined to comment on the dispute. SQM did not comment directly on Albemarle’s accusations when contacted by Reuters. The Chilean miner said in a statement that Corfo had “independently contracted top-level specialists” for the water study. SQM added it had adhered to the terms of its contract with Corfo and provided the agency with all of the information regulators had requested. The study and the true state of the Salar’s water supply has long been an obsession of lithium industry watchers because of the area’s huge importance in satisfying soaring global demand for the white metal. Lithium is vital to the batteries that power cellphones and electric vehicles. Lawmakers, academics, environmentalists, local communities, German carmaker Volkswagen VOWG_p.DE and most recently, a Chilean environmental tribunal, have all emphasized the importance of the study in helping dispel lingering questions on the impact of lithium mining in Chile. Corfo said in the filings the revised study will be completed by February 2021. The agency did not say if, or when, the document might be made public."

The Chinese firm, which is struggling to repay a $3.5 billion loan taken out to buy a stake in Chilean miner SQM in 2018, said in a filing to the Shenzhen Stock Exchange it made a 696.57 million yuan ($101.47 million) net loss in January-June. That compared with a net profit of 193.41 million yuan a year earlier and means Tianqi has now racked up losses of 6.87 billion yuan, or $1 billion, over the last four quarters, company filings and Refinitiv Eikon data show. The first-half result was near the lower end of the guided range for the loss, however, and implies a loss of 196.27 million yuan in the second quarter - smaller than the roughly 500 million yuan Tianqi lost in January-March. First-half revenues fell 27.4% to 1.88 billion yuan as the coronavirus pandemic hit lithium demand and weighed on prices. Sales volumes and prices of lithium chemicals, as well as the sales price of lithium concentrate, “decreased significantly compared with the same period of the previous year, resulting in a decline in operating income,” said Tianqi, whose president Vivian Wu left the company earlier this month. A decline in SQM’s performance led to lower investment income, the Chengdu-based firm added. Tianqi jointly operates the Greenbushes lithium mine in Australia with Albemarle Corp and owns processing capacity to make chemicals such as lithium carbonate and hydroxide used in EV batteries. Lithium carbonate prices in China AM-995C-LTCB are down around 20% this year near their lowest in seven years, having been in freefall since 2018 amid oversupply.

41.40536981027476," Chile lithium producer SQM posts record sales, profits plagued by low prices SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chilean miner SQM SQMB.SN achieved record second-quarter sales of lithium even as low prices ravaged profits, the world's No. 2 producer of the metal used in electric car batteries said on Wednesday. SQM said it sold more than 12,600 tonnes of lithium in April through June, up 45% from the first three months of the year. Its Chile operations continued to churn out the white metal even as the coronavirus pandemic hits its peak in the South American nation, the company said. “We have met or exceeded all internal production goals which included record production levels of lithium carbonate,” Chief Executive Ricardo Ramos said in a statement. “We still believe that our sales volumes for the year will exceed the sales volumes reported during 2019, thus increasing our market share,” Ramos added. Production was in line with an annual rate of 70,000 tonnes, the company said, allowing it to build higher levels of inventory ahead of an expected demand boom. Net income, however, plunged 27.6% year-on-year to $50.8 million, dragged down by prices, which SQM said fell 45% in the first six months of 2020 versus the previous year. Supply swamped demand earlier this year, undercutting prices and hammering the earnings of top lithium producers. “We believe that prices will be lower during the second half of the year compared to the prices observed in the first half of the year, although sales volumes should be higher,” Ramos said. Total revenue for the company, also a specialty fertilizer producer, fell 7.2% to $458.5 million in the quarter. Revenue from lithium fell 38%. SQM last week lost a key legal battle, forcing it back to the drawing board on an environmental compliance plan to make amends for over-pumping lithium-rich brine from the Atacama salt flat. Ramos said on an earnings call on Thursday SQM had already begun working on the new plan. The previous iteration required three years of work to garner approval from regulators and had a price tag of $25 million. “We hope and we´re sure that we´re going to obtain all the necessary approvals of the new plan in the coming months,” Ramos said. The company said its lithium capacity expansion projects in Chile remained on track and would be completed by the end of 2021."
29.97898090390132," Exclusive: Chilean regulator preps sweeping Atacama review as it abandons SQM legal battle SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile’s environmental regulator has withdrawn from its legal battle to defend a compliance plan by lithium miner SQM that it approved last year, according to a filing seen by Reuters, a decision that could prove a major setback as the miner seeks to ramp up output of the coveted battery metal. The Environmental Superintendent (SMA) also said it was planning a new “comprehensive management plan” for the Atacama salt flat in northern Chile where SQM and other companies mine lithium and copper. The flat supplies around one-quarter of the world’s lithium, an ultralight metal that helps power electric vehicles and cell phones. In 2019, the regulator gave its blessing to a $25 million compliance plan drawn up over three years by SQM after an investigation found the company had over-drawn lithium-rich brine from the salt flat. But that decision was tossed out by a regional court in December at the behest of local indigenous communities. The SMA had been planning to take the battle to defend the compliance plan to the country’s Supreme Court, but said in the filing that it had ultimately decided not to fight the lower court’s order. “The (decision) to drop the appeal... comes as the SMA begins to develop a comprehensive management plan for the Atacama salt flat basin,” the agency said. The about-face by the regulator is likely to be seen as a win for indigenous and environmental activists, who have long called for closer scrutiny of mining in the region. The agency did not elaborate on why it had changed its mind. Soaring lithium demand has raised questions about whether Atacama can support current and future levels of lithium production along with the needs of sprawling nearby copper mines, a booming tourism industry, and indigenous communities. The SMA said its new management plan was aimed at assessing the impacts of “four principal companies that have projects in the salt flat.” The filing named SQM, SQM’s lithium rival Albemarle, Antofagasta’s Zaldivar copper mine and BHP’s Escondida, the world’s largest copper mine. Those actions include “enforcement,” the agency said, citing its recent decision to charge Escondida with over-pumping water for 15 years. It also said it would cross-reference data from the miners, in order to better understand their environmental footprint. SQM told Reuters in a written statement that it respected the regulator’s decision and would resubmit its compliance plan for a fresh evaluation. “We believe that the SMA’s withdrawal will focus the efforts of all those involved on complying with regulations and the concerns of the communities,” the company said. Albemarle declined to comment on the regulator’s decision. Last year, the company announced a voluntary plan to begin monitoring water flows beneath the salt flat. BHP and Antofagasta did not immediately reply to requests for comment. The decision does not call on the companies to scale back or halt their operations, but raises new questions about environmental management at a time when SQM has sought to expand its operations in the Atacama. Water continues to be a major sticking point for the plans of both SQM and Albemarle to boost output of lithium from the salt flats of the Atacama, the world’s driest desert and by far the biggest source of supply in South America’s so-called ‘lithium triangle’. Besides environmentalists, car companies, including Volkswagen and Daimler, have also ratcheted up scrutiny of their lithium suppliers in the area. The lower court, in its December 2019 decision to scrap SQM’s compliance plan, noted the flat’s “particular fragility” and called for a water model to help ensure mining on the flat was sustainable. The SMA had initially rebuked those arguments, calling the court’s decision “unfounded.” It accused judges of cherry-picking information to favor its finding and “omitting... evidence that had been pondered by the SMA.” In the latest filing, the SMA said it now believed it best to abide by the court’s decision and require SQM to conduct a new compliance plan."

Chile’s Environmental Superintendent (SMA) approved SQM’s compliance plan early in 2019 after a multi-year investigation found the miner had overdrawn lithium-rich brine from the salt flat. But the regulator said in a filing dated Thursday that it would begin the process anew to comply with a decision of a regional environmental court in December which invalidated SQM´s plan, calling it “insufficient.” Both SQM and the regulator have since appealed that decision to Chile´s Supreme Court, but the lower tribunal said environmental regulators must comply with its order even as the Supreme Court ponders a potential reversal. SQM confirmed to Reuters that SMA had re-opened the process. The company added that it had voluntarily agreed to continue with some protection measures in the now rejected plan while it awaits a decision from the higher court. The process does not immediately effect SQM´s ability to operate on the flat but is likely to prove yet another headache for the miner, which is seeking to expand its operations at Atacama. The region supplies about one-quarter of the global supply of lithium, a key ingredient in the batteries that power cellphones and electric vehicles."

Albemarle, the world´s No.1 miner of the ultralight battery metal, told Reuters in an email Wednesday it planned to immediately shut down its Atacama potash plant for 15 working days in order to comply with restrictions requiring miners cut back staff. “This measure meets our objective of reducing staffing levels by 24 people (10% of our total staff)...amid a rise in infections across the country,” the company said. The U.S.-based miner said the decision would not impact its production of lithium, a vital ingredient in the batteries that power electric vehicles. Albemarle told Reuters a total of 17 of its Chile-based workers and contractors had been infected with the virus, including 14 who work on the salt flat. Only three cases remained active, Albemarle said. Top competitor SQM, the world´s No. 2 lithium miner, told Reuters in an email Wednesday that one of its workers had died earlier this week from COVID-19. The company did not respond to a request for a tally of how many workers had been infected by the coronavirus. SQM said it too had reduced staffing levels, but that exports remained unscathed. “We have been able to fulfill all of our export (orders),” the company said.

The company said health concerns around the coronavirus had also prompted it to put off $100 million in non-essential capital expenditures in 2020, or around one-quarter of its planned investment for the year. “Average lithium prices were almost 50% lower than average prices seen during the same period last year,” Chief Executive Ricardo Ramos said in a statement, adding that sales of the white metal slipped more than expected. Sales to China, a priority market for SQM, dropped by 2,000 tonnes in the first quarter, Ramos said in an earnings call.The sharp fall in prices and lagging sales dragged lithium revenue down 58% versus the previous year, the company said. Gross profits from lithium operations, half of SQM´s business during the first quarter of 2019, now account for just 12% of its total, the company said. Ramos said he expected a recovery in China would ensure a strong third and fourth quarter, and allow SQM to increase market share as competitors falter. “We expect to sell more this year as compared to the previous one,” he said. “We are building inventory, and this will help us to have better flexibility.” SQM, which operates in Chile´s far-flung Atacama salt flat, said safety measures implemented early during the country´s coronavirus outbreak had spared it the worst. Chile, a South American mining powerhouse and the top global producer of copper, has seen cases of COVID-19 spike in the past week as its health care system teeters on collapse. “Today we operate at normal levels, so much so that production today in all of our facilities is above...our original budget for the year,” Ramos said in the earnings call. Ramos said he was confident the company would move forward with expansion plans in 2021 to compensate for coronavirus-related setbacks. “Our strong balance sheet and firm commitment to the lithium market allows us to continue moving forward with our capacity expansion plans in lithium carbonate and lithium hydroxide,” the company said. SQM´s tough first quarter is likely to weigh heavily on Tianqi Lithium Corp 002466.SZ, a top shareholder and another of the world's biggest lithium producers. The Chengdu, China-based lithium giant has been struggling to repay loans to finance its high-profile $4.1 billion acquisition of nearly a quarter of SQM - agreed in 2018 when prices for lithium were much higher."
37.67008788334541," SQM profits plunge again on lower lithium prices, expansion on track SANTIAGO, May 20 (Reuters) - Chilean miner SQM, the world’s No. 2 producer of lithium, said profits plunged by nearly half in the first quarter of 2020 as prices for the battery metal continued to freefall amid the spread of the coronavirus.

33.26228978934668," China's Tianqi Lithium expects to stay in red after big 2019 loss BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s Tianqi Lithium Corp said on Wednesday it expects to post a net loss of up to 932.4 million yuan ($131.7 million) in the first half of 2020 on lower lithium prices, after revising to a much worse-than-expected 6 billion yuan loss for last year. Tianqi’s share price fell as much as 10% on Tuesday to its lowest since November 2015 after it said its 2019 net loss was going to be double previous guidance due to a higher impairment provision on its stake in Chilean miner SQM. Tianqi, one of the world’s top producers of lithium, used in batteries for electric vehicles, has flagged liquidity problems as it struggles to repay loans taken out to buy the 23.8% stake in SQM for $4.1 billion in 2018. The company confirmed a 5.98 billion yuan loss for 2019 on Wednesday, and reported a 500.3 million yuan loss for the first quarter of 2020, near the top of previous guidance for a quarterly loss and compared to a profit of 111.3 million yuan a year earlier. Tianqi estimated its first-half 2020 loss at between 621.6 million and 932.4 million yuan. Combined losses of as much as $1 billion over the 12-month period to June 30 will pile further financial pressure on Tianqi, which is already considering asset sales to reduce debt. Prices for lithium have fallen around 70% since Tianqi agreed to buy the SQM stake and are languishing at five-year lows. Tianqi has been linked with selling part of its stake in the Greenbushes mine in Western Australia, the largest and lowest cost hard-rock lithium mine in the world. Such a sale would likely draw interest from suitors like Fortescue Metals Group. Chengdu-based Tianqi said in February it had set aside an impairment provision of 2.2 billion yuan for its stake in SQM, formally known as Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile. On Tuesday it said it had increased the provision by another 3.07 billion yuan for 2019. An impairment is a loss in the recoverable amount of an asset on a company’s balance sheet. Tianqi said the revision on the impairment was made because of the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on SQM’s key lithium export markets, such as the United States and Europe, which had been underestimated in February. It also noted that SQM last month forecast lithium prices would fall further due to oversupply, while a report from consultancy Roskill pointed to a worsening outlook for electric vehicle sales due to the pandemic."

The Chinese firm, which has flagged liquidity problems as it struggles to repay loans taken out to buy the 23.8% stake in 2018, said in a filing to the Shenzhen Stock Exchange its annual net loss is now set to total 5.98 billion yuan ($843.6 million). The filing was an adjustment to Tianqi’s preliminary 2019 result - a net loss of 2.8 billion yuan which was announced in February. The company is due to release its full earnings report later on Tuesday. The huge net loss will pile further financial pressure on Tianqi, which has already said it is considering asset sales to reduce its debt load as prices for lithium AM-99C-LTCB languish at multi-year troughs around two-thirds lower than they were when it agreed to buy the SQM stake. Tianqi has been linked with selling part of its stake in the Greenbushes mine in Western Australia, the largest and lowest cost hard-rock lithium mine in the world, which is expected to draw interest from suitors such as Fortescue Metals Group .

Tianqi said the revision was made because of the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on SQM’s key lithium export markets, such as the United States and Europe, which had been underestimated in February. Furthermore, SQM last month said it expected lithium prices to fall further and the outlook for electric vehicle demand is worsening, Tianqi said in the filing. Tianqi’s shares slumped as much as 10% on Tuesday to 16.34 yuan, the lowest since November 2015. The company is also due to report earnings for the first quarter of 2020 later on Tuesday, for which it has flagged a loss of 450-510 million yuan."
44.52584484977689," Chile´s lithium miner SQM warns plans could change as coronavirus hits demand SANTIAGO, April 23 (Reuters) - Chilean miner SQM said on Thursday the coronavirus outbreak had yet to hit its lithium output, but warned it might have to scale back plans for 2020 if a slump continues in demand for the coveted battery metal. The world´s No. 2 miner of lithium had planned to unleash at least $330 million in 2020 to expand production capacity out of Chile´s Atacama salt flat, according to SQM board chairman Alberto Salas. The region is among the world´s richest in lithium. Economic slowdowns during the coronavirus pandemic have ravaged demand in top markets like China, prompting a closer look, Salas said in a letter to shareholders. “As we continue to assess the changing global economic environment and the impacts it might have on demand growth in the industries we sell to, we may find it prudent to delay or modify our capital spending plan for this year,” Salas said. With automakers reeling during the crisis, both the United States and China have talked recently of moving more slowly on regulations designed to encourage production of electric vehicles. Such decisions in large markets could dent demand for lithium, a key metal used in the batteries that power the vehicles. The pandemic is the latest headache for SQM and the lithium industry at large, with prices for the powdery white metal down 37 percent in the past year due to mounting supply, according to data from Benchmark Minerals Intelligence. Chile, home to SQM and top competitor Albemarle , saw the value of its lithium exports plunge 38.5% in the first quarter of 2020, according to Customs trade data, consistent with the global downturn in prices. Indigenous leaders in the Atacama region where both companies operate have asked SQM and Albemarle to shut down their operations to stave off spread of the virus. Several villages near the salt flat have closed their communities to outsiders. But Albemarle and SQM say they have taken the necessary precautions to limit the spread of the virus. Both report minimal impact on production. “Until now, our operations have no seen any material impact related to the coronavirus outbreak,” Salas said in the letter to shareholders on Thursday.

The lithium giant is the latest miner to report grim 2019 results as overproduction of the metal drives down prices and dents revenues. SQM posted fourth-quarter net income of $66.9 million, a 38% drop compared to $108.6 million in the same period in 2018, according to its quarterly earnings statement. Gross profits slid more than 30% to $137.8 million. Quarterly lithium revenues plunged 57.4%, battered by continued low prices, the company said. It added that the oversupply driving the fall in prices could linger into 2020 and “further impact average prices this year when compared to 2019.” SQM CEO Ricardo Ramos said overall lithium demand nonetheless grew 14% in 2019, in line with the company’s expectations and hinting at a coming boom in demand. “During 2020, we believe the European electric vehicle market will gain momentum and contribute significantly to lithium demand growth,” the company said in the statement. In China, Ramos noted logistics had been dogged by the coronavirus but said there were signs business was getting back to normal. “Depending on the evolution of the coronavirus outbreak, we may be able to recover some of those sales volumes and reach 55-60k metric tonnes in 2020.” He said SQM would produce as much as 70,000 tonnes of lithium in 2020 in a bid to build inventory and increase shipments to China to 40% of the company’s total sales volumes, up from 30% in 2019. SQM rival Albemarle Corp, the world’s largest lithium producer, last month reported lower-than-expected profits in late 2019 and forecast a double-digit drop in 2020 earnings on weak prices for the battery metal.

-28.72821700903297," Chile regulator says lithium miner SQM compliance plan adequate, appeals lower court decision SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile’s environmental regulator on Wednesday defended in court its approval of a plan by top lithium miner SQM to remediate damage to the Atacama salt flat, appealing a lower court decision to scrap the agreement and setting the stage for a new and prolonged legal battle. Chile’s Environmental Superintendent (SMA) blessed SQM’s $25 million compliance plan in 2019 after a multi-year investigation that found SQM had over-drawn lithium-rich brine from the salt flat. But a local environmental court in Antofagasta in December invalidated the plan, calling it “insufficient.” The regulator called the lower court’s arguments that the plan failed to safeguard the environment “unfounded.” It accused judges of cherry-picking information to favor its finding and “omitting... evidence that had been pondered by the SMA.” “These errors lead the judges to an incorrect conclusion,” the SMA said in a sharply worded 63-page appeal. “The sentence is totally unjustified in minimizing the technical expertise of the SMA.” The SMA’s appeal must now be considered by Chile’s Supreme Court. If successful, it could put an end to years of legal and regulatory wrangling over charges that SQM had over-drawn brine from the environmentally sensitive salt flat. If the appeal fails, the SMA must abide by the lower court ruling and re-open the sanctioning process against SQM, raising new questions about the miner’s Atacama expansion plans. That process could drag on for some time, as the lower court in December said SQM had no way of proving - and that the SMA had no way of verifying - that the measures it had proposed were capable of “containing and reducing or eliminating the negative effects generated by the breaches of the company.” SQM did not immediately reply to a request for comment on the latest twist in the long-running legal battle. But water continues to be a major sticking point for the plans of both SQM and top competitor Albemarle to boost output from the salt flats of the Atacama, the world’s driest desert. The region supplies around one-third of the global supply of lithium, a key ingredient in the batteries that power cell phones and electric vehicles. Soaring lithium demand has raised questions about whether the region can support current and future levels of lithium production along with the needs of sprawling nearby copper mines, a booming tourism industry and indigenous communities. Chile possesses the world’s largest reserves of lithium. But the nation’s output has barely budged in recent years, as bureaucratic and environmental hurdles have stymied development."

16.002424282793818," Chile's SQM to decide on future of lithium holdings in Maricunga by year's end: mining minister SALAR DE AGUILAR, Chile (Reuters) - Chile has asked top lithium miner SQM to decide by year’s end what it will do with its holdings in the Maricunga salt flat, the country’s second richest in lithium, Chile’s mining minister told Reuters. Though Maricunga’s 90 square miles (145 sq. km) make it less than 5 percent the size of the lithium-rich Salar de Atacama in northern Chile, high-grade deposits of the ultralight battery metal nonetheless make it attractive to several prospective miners. But fractured ownership has slowed development. “We have asked SQM, which has holdings on the flat, to participate in a work group to determine what it will do with them,” Mining Minister Baldo Prokurica told Reuters on a trip to the Salar de Aguilar salt flat in the arid north of Chile. Prokurica said he had asked SQM to respond by “year’s end.” SQM did not respond to a request for comment. A decision by SQM on how to move forward with its holdings at the still-undeveloped lithium deposit could potentially bolster prospects for a joint project with Chile state-run copper miner Codelco. SQM’s 2018 contract with Chile development agency Corfo, which authorizes it to mine the flat, includes an option to work with Codelco, which also has holdings at Maricunga, to develop a project there. SQM and Codelco have not yet announced a deal. Codelco has for years talked of getting into the lithium business, but has repeatedly delayed plans to develop its reserves to concentrate on copper, its primary business. Codelco is also in talks over a potential joint project at Maricunga with foreign-backed miner Salar Blanco, which also has holdings on the flat and is pushing forward with final environmental approvals. Salar Blanco is 50% owned by Australia’s Lithium Power International, with smaller stakes held by Canada’s Bearing Lithium and local capital. Chile possesses the world’s largest reserves of lithium, a key ingredient in batteries for electric vehicles. But the nation’s output has barely budged in recent years, as bureaucratic and environmental hurtles have stymied development."
38.2475531874271," Lithium miner SQM dodges impacts from Chile protests, hit by lower prices SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chilean miner SQM SQMA.SN, the world's No. 2 lithium producer, said a month of violent protests in the South American nation would not dent the company's sales or volume forecasts for 2019. Protests over inequality paralyzed major cities in the South American nation for weeks, leaving at least 23 dead, hobbling public transportation networks and causing around $1.5 billion in damages to private business. “We have had some issues with transit of our products, workers and contractors,” said SQM CEO Ricardo Ramos of the company’s operations. In late October, indigenous protesters said they had blocked access to SQM’s operations at Atacama. “We are going to deliver our products to our customers according to our previous forecast despite the situation in Chile,” Ramos told investors on a conference call on Thursday. “I don’t foresee that this will be a strong issue in our business goals in the medium and long term.” Albemarle, SQM´s top competitor and neighbor on Chile’s Atacama salt flat, said earlier this month that unrest had reduced Chilean production by about 500 tonnes but is not expected to have a material impact on annual results. Chile is the world’s No. 2 producer of lithium, behind Australia. The metal is a key component of batteries used in cell phones, electric vehicles and other consumer goods. SQM said late Wednesday profits had plunged in the third quarter, ahead of the protests, on sagging prices for the key battery metal and softer-than-expected demand this year from China. Profits sank 27.5% to $60.5 million in the third quarter, from $83.5 million a year earlier, the company reported. SQM said prices had fallen 28%, though sales volumes continued to grow, up 12% through September, and up 6% over the second quarter. Lithium revenues fell 26.4% over the same quarter the previous year, as falling prices continued to offset increasing sales volumes. Ramos said 2019 demand growth would likely hit 14%, lower than the company´s long-term estimates of 16% to 20%. The company said it nonetheless expected to meet 2019 sales volume targets of 47,000 tonnes of lithium, and remained “very positive about the long-term demand fundamentals.” But a wave of new mine production even as China has scaled back subsidies have pushed down prices in recent months, prompting some miners to put near-term investments on ice in an industry already scrambling for capital."

In the first nine months of 2019, net profits were down 91.7% year-on-year at 139.5 million yuan. Third-quarter revenues were down 17.8% year-on-year at 1.21 billion yuan. The company had earlier this month flagged an expected slump in nine-month profits of more than 90%. It apologised to investors for the performance, which it blamed on a foreign exchange loss and lower than expected ore supply from its Greenbushes mine in Australia. Tianqi’s financial expenses – including those related to loans taken out to acquire the SQM stake for around $4.1 billion in 2018 – rose more than 500% year-on-year in the third quarter, The company also said on Tuesday it had a relatively large amount of liabilities in foreign currencies. The yuan weakened by about 4% against the U.S. dollar the third quarter. The company now expects its full-year net profit to come in at 80-120 million yuan, implying an estimated net loss of at least 19.5 million yuan in the final quarter.

-3.079441030547947," Chilean lithium producer SQM bullish on white gold demand; shares rise SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Shares in Chilean lithium producer SQM jumped on Wednesday after it announced plans to invest about $2.1 billion in the next five years to strengthen its production amid an expected increase in demand for the ultralight battery metal. About $1.332 billion of this investment would be in lithium operations, with further amounts going toward growing its nitrates and iodine capacity and maintenance between 2019 to 2023, Chief Executive Ricardo Ramos said in a presentation to investors in New York on Tuesday. B-Series shares in SQM were up more than 5% in trading on Santiago’s blue-chip stock exchange following the promise of beefed-up investment. Demand and prices of lithium have been stifled in recent months by global trade tensions, the scaling back of electric vehicle subsidies in China and new output. But Pablo Altimiras, senior vice president for SQM´s lithium and iodine division, said he expects solid demand in the coming years. “The fundamentals support a vision of significant growth in the coming years,” he said. Ramos said he expected lithium sales volume to reach 173,000 tonnes by 2025 through operations in Chile and Australia. “The opportunities for growth in the lithium business could result in a gross profit contribution of about $1 billion by 2025,” the company´s presentation said. The average lithium price is expected to be between $10 and $15 per kilo by 2025, compared to the current $14.50, the company predicted, with demand set to grow between 16% and 20% by 2025. “Considering both demand fundamentals and supply cost structure, equilibrium price could be higher than historic average, even in double digits,” the company presentation said. It is also awaiting feasibility studies on its joint venture Mount Holland project here in Australia."
-0.6227314663618054," Chilean miner SQM profits plunge alongside lithium price SANTIAGO (Reuters) - SQM, the world’s No. 2 producer of lithium, saw its profits plunge along with lithium prices in the second quarter, even as the Chile-based miner said it had sold more of the ultralight battery metal. Profits sank 47.5% to $70.2 million in the second quarter, from $133.9 million a year earlier, the company said in a statement, though the drop was largely in line with analysts’ expectations. “The second quarter results were mainly impacted by lower lithium sale prices,” Chief Executive Ricardo Ramos said in a statement. “We have seen lithium supply growing more than demand over the past few quarters, putting pressure on prices.” News of the pessimistic outlook for prices sent B-shares in SQM SQM_pb.SN down 6.6% at mid-afternoon on Santiago's Stock Exchange. Shares of lithium industry leader Albemarle Corp fell 4.4% and Livent Corp dropped 5.6%, both on the New York Stock Exchange. SQM said its lithium sale price in the third quarter was likely to drop to $10,000 per tonne, down one-third from its average first-quarter sale price of $14,600. The third-quarter figure may also weigh on a previous SQM estimate of $11,000-$12,000 per tonne for the second half of 2019. Demand for lithium, a key component of batteries used in cell phones, electric vehicles and other consumer goods, is widely expected to triple by 2025. But festering global trade tensions, the scaling back of electric vehicle subsidies in China and a wave of new output have stifled both demand and prices in recent months. Ramos said the downturn in prices was likely attributable in part to flagging Chinese demand, which he expected to fall by 3,000-4,000 tonnes in 2019. “The reduction in total demand of lithium carbonate in China...is affecting supply and demand worldwide,” Ramos said. Weak demand and looming oversupply have already prompted some miners to put off near-term investments. The world’s top lithium producer Albemarle said earlier this month it would delay construction plans for about 125,000 tons of additional lithium processing capacity. Despite the headwinds, SQM said it expected sales volumes to increase later this year. Sales volumes grew more than 14% in the second quarter to 22,800 tonnes, the company said. SQM earlier this year delayed an expansion at its Atacama operations from the end of 2020 to late 2021, citing fast-changing technical specifications of buyers. Ramos said in a Thursday earnings call that he expected sales volumes to hit 65,000 tonnes in 2020."
-0.6227314663618054," Chile's SQM profits plummet on falling lithium prices SANTIAGO, Aug 22 (Reuters) - Chile’s SQM, the world’s No. 2 producer of lithium, saw its quarterly earnings plummet by nearly half amid a slump in prices for the ultralight battery metal, even as sales volumes grew. Profits sank 47.5% to $70.2 million in the second quarter, from $133.9 million a year earlier, though the figure was largely in line with analyst expectations. “The second quarter results were mainly impacted by lower lithium sale prices,” Chief Executive Ricardo Ramos said in a statement. “We have seen lithium supply growing more than demand over the past few quarters, putting pressure on prices.” SQM said its lithium sale price in the third quarter was likely to fall by nearly one-third to $10,000, from its average first-quarter sale price of $14,600 per tonne. The figure also represents a drop from a previous SQM estimate of $11,000-$12,000 per tonne for the second half of 2019. The miner attributed the sharp drop in its selling prices to higher sales to China, where prices have slumped. Demand for lithium, a key component of batteries used in cell phones, electric vehicles and other consumer goods, is widely expected to spike by 2025. But festering global trade tensions, the scaling back of electric vehicle subsidies in China and a wave of new production have pushed down prices in recent months, prompting some miners to put off near-term investments. World top lithium producer Albemarle said earlier this month it would delay construction plans for about 125,000 tons of additional lithium processing capacity, citing a market oversupply. Still, SQM expects sales volumes to jump in the near-term, noting it had already boosted sales volumes to China. “We sold higher sales volumes in the second quarter and expect to sell higher volumes in the second half of the year as we prepare for a 30% to 40% increase in sales volumes next year,” Ramos said. Sales volumes grew more than 14% in the second quarter, to 22,800 tonnes, the company said. SQM earlier this year pushed back a key expansion at its Atacama salt flat operations from the end of 2020 to late 2021. The company blamed the unexpected delay on fast-evolving requirements of the red-hot battery technology industry, but said flagging demand and prices had not weighed on its decision."
-16.64883827608729," Tianqi says happy 'for now' with stake in SQM: president SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Tianqi Lithium Corp is happy for now with its stake in rival SQM and is working to deepen business ties with the Chilean lithium producer, the Chinese company’s president said on Monday. Tianqi last December bought a 23.8 percent share in SQM from Canadian fertilizer company Nutrien for $4.1 billion, the largest deal in history for a lithium asset. Lithium is a key material used to make electric car batteries. An agreement with SQM limits Tianqi’s access to certain strategic business information. Still, the deal was seen by many as a shrewd expansion by the Chinese company into the country with the world’s largest supply of the white metal. “We are happy for now. We are still trying to understand the business better and find a better way to help,” Tianqi President Vivian Wu told Reuters in an interview ahead of the Fastmarkets Lithium Supply and Markets Conference in Santiago. Wu said she traveled earlier this month to Chile’s Atacama desert, visiting SQM’s lithium brine operations and meeting with the company’s executives. During that trip, Wu met with representatives from Pampa Group - SQM’s largest shareholder - including its head, Julio Ponce Lerou, who initially opposed the Tianqi-SQM deal. The Pampa relationship “has come a long way in the last six months,” Wu said. “We feel very good about it.” An SQM spokeswoman declined to comment. SQM said last month it would delay a key expansion of production capacity from the Atacama until the end of 2021 amid a slump in prices for the battery metal. Wu on Monday called the delay “understandable.” “We understand for any new project expansion, it takes time,” Wu said, adding she “fully supports” SQM’s plans to sell more lithium in Chile’s domestic market. The London Metal Exchange (LME) on Monday said it would partner with Fastmarkets to provide a reference price for its planned new lithium contract. Wu said the contract is “going to be helpful for us” and should bring more clarity to the market. “This is going to help reduce (lithium) price volatility,” said Wu. Spot lithium prices in China have dropped double digits since January as the country moves to phase out electric vehicle subsidies. Despite the drop, Wu said she believes Chinese prices will stabilize, benefiting Tianqi. “The lithium industry is solid and strong,” she said. “The industry is just taking its time to adapt.”"

-24.662144081095754," Chile lithium producer SQM delays Atacama expansion amid price slump SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile’s SQM, the world’s No. 2 producer of lithium, said on Thursday it would delay a key expansion of production capacity from the Atacama salt flat until the end of 2021 amid a slump in prices for the coveted battery metal. The miner had previously expected installed capacity in Chile to reach 120,000 tonnes “by the end of 2020,” an expansion of 50,000 tonnes over current capacity, according to filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in March. News of the delay came on the back of an earnings drop of nearly 30% in the first quarter, due to weaker lithium prices and higher royalty payments to the government. Chief Executive Ricardo Ramos said in an earnings call the unexpected delay in its plant expansion was due to fast-evolving requirements of the red-hot battery technology industry. Lithium is a key component of batteries used in cell phones, electric vehicles and other consumer goods. “The delay is not related to the market or demand,” said Ramos, adding that both permits and technology were in place for the Atacama capacity expansion. “We are going as fast as we can.” Series-B shares in SQM fell as much as 6.6% on the Santiago’s Stock Exchange. U.S.-listed shares were down about 5.2%. SQM’s quarterly earnings fell to $80.5 million from $113.8 million a year earlier. Ramos attributed much of the decline in profits to “lower margins in the lithium business line.” The Chilean miner sold lithium at an average price of $14,600 per ton, an 8% drop from the fourth quarter of 2018. “As expected, during the first quarter, the lithium market saw price pressure as new supply entered the market,” Ramos said. Ramos expected prices during the second half of 2019 to fall again, to between $11,000-$12,000 per ton as additional supply comes on line from new lithium mines across the globe. He said new royalties put in place by Chilean development agency Corfo last year, considered to be the highest in the world, had hurt profitability in the first quarter. Payments to Corfo nearly quadrupled versus the previous period, from $12 million to $45 million, according to SQM’s earnings statement. Ramos said the payments, which run on a sliding scale according to the price of lithium, would fall during the second half of 2019, alongside dropping sale prices. SQM last year struck a deal with the government to more than triple production to 180,000 tonnes in exchange for paying sharply higher royalties and offering discounted lithium to domestic value-added producers of battery components. The company expects to produce 60,000 tonnes of lithium in 2019, with sales volumes this year reaching between 45,000 and 50,000 tonnes. By 2020, SQM predicts that sales volumes would jump 30% over 2019, reaching approximately 65,000 metric tons."

-21.024227113564166," China's Tianqi taps 'safe choices' for board of top lithium miner SQM SANTIAGO (Reuters) - China’s Tianqi Lithium Corp said on Wednesday it would nominate two Chileans and a U.S. businessman to the board of lithium miner SQM, candidates seen as ‘safe choices’ for the world’s No. 2 lithium producer as it faces booming demand. Tianqi last year paid $4.1 billion for a near-quarter stake in SQM, as Chinese companies scoured the globe for the ultralight battery metal needed to ramp up Chinese production of electric vehicles. Lithium is a key component in the batteries that power everything from cellphones to electric cars. Tianqi’s U.S. nominee, businessman Robert Zatta, worked as a chief financial officer until 2015 for Rockwood Holdings, a top competitor of SQM in Chile’s Salar de Atacama, before it was purchased by the U.S.-based Albemarle, now the world’s top lithium producer. Previously, Zatta had worked as an executive with the Campbell Soup Company. Tianqi also nominated Chilean attorney Francisco Ugarte, who represented the Chinese lithium producer in its 2018 purchase of the stake in SQM. The other Chilean nominee, economist Georges de Bourguignon Arndt, is currently on the board of LATAM Airlines, Latin America’s largest carrier. Lithium analyst Joe Lowry called the candidates “non-controversial, safe choices.” He noted that Zatta, who has the most experience in battery metals, had been out of the business for several years. Tianqi’s announcement comes days after executives from SQM top shareholder Pampa Group, which in 2018 fiercely contested Tianqi’s purchase of a stake in the Chilean miner, flew to China to meet with Tianqi Chief Executive Officer Vivian Wu. Pampa and Tianqi, now SQM’s top two shareholders, struck an agreement following that trip widely seen as a “truce,” praising one another and agreeing on a code of conduct for board appointees. Pampa had previously raised concerns about Tianqi’s access to SQM business secrets and the potential they could be leaked to top competitor Albemarle. Tianqi and Albemarle together participate in a joint venture that controls the world’s biggest lithium mine, Greenbushes, in Australia. A Chilean antitrust court approved in October Tianqi’s purchase of the shares in SQM, but placed conditions on the sale that limit access to SQM secrets by board members appointed by the Chinese miner. Tianqi’s official board nominations will take place on April 25 at a shareholders meeting in Santiago, the statement said."

Tianqi’s $4.1 billion purchase of a 23.77 percent stake in SQM, which mines lithium used in electric vehicle batteries, went through in December, but the Chinese firm has faced push back from Pampa Group and its head Julio Ponce Lerou. The agreement established that SQM board decisions and the company’s operations would be independent of both parties, the two sides said in a joint statement. “We hope with this agreement we have left our differences in the past and we can focus our energies on the future supporting SQM, its administration and its board,” Patricio Contesse, vice president of Pampa Group, said in the statement. Pampa Group had tried to block Tianqi taking its stake in SQM, raising concerns that the move would allow Tianqi to access strategic information from the miner. Tianqi Chairman Jiang Weiping heralded Pampa Group and Ponce in the statement as having “vision and talent”. Ponce has been a key figure in SQM since it was privatized in the 1980s under his former father-in-law, dictator Augusto Pinochet. The Chinese miner also said on Thursday it aimed to raise up to 7 billion yuan ($1.04 billion) in a share placement to repay loans taken out for its purchase of the SQM stake. The new agreement includes various technical elements including around the substitution of board members, veto rights, financial statements and support for dividend policy."

The $400 million plant expansion, once complete, would allow the Chinese-backed SQM to eventually produce as much as 180,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate a year from its Atacama salt flat operations in Chile. SQM is the world’s number two producer of lithium, a key component in the batteries that power electric vehicles, cell phones and other consumer goods. China’s Tianqi Lithium Corp bought a stake in the firm last year. SQM CEO Ricardo Ramos earlier this week said he expected the expansion, if approved, would come online “in the future,” but did not specify a date. SQM has previously said it hopes to be able to produce 120,000 tonnes annually by 2020, nearly double its current capacity of 70,000 tonnes. Water has become a key sticking point for the expansion plans of both SQM and top competitor Albemarle, both of which operate in the Atacama desert, the world’s driest. Soaring lithium demand has raised questions about whether the Atacama salt flat can support current and future levels of production. SQM vice president Alejandro Bucher said in a statement that he believed the plant expansion approved on Thursday would contribute to sustainable development of the region. “One of the most relevant benefits of this project is the optimization of water use for production,” Bucher said."

Tianqi’s $4.1 billion purchase of a 23.77 percent stake in SQM, the world’s second-biggest producer of lithium, a metal used in electric vehicle batteries, went through in December. The purchase drew scrutiny from Chilean regulators and opposition from SQM’s majority shareholder Pampa Group after it was announced in May 2018. Tianqi, based in Chengdu, is not entitled to any of SQM’s lithium production but has secured three seats on the eight-member SQM board. “We have to put the interests of the shareholders first,” Jiang said in an interview in Beijing, declining to identify the chosen board candidates, who will be announced next month. Under a deal with anti-trust regulators, Tianqi cannot appoint any of its executives or employees as SQM directors. Jiang, a delegate from Tianqi’s home province of Sichuan at the ongoing National People’s Congress, also revealed he had been in contact with former SQM chairman Julio Ponce Lerou, who controls Pampa Group, “a few times” but had yet to sit down for formal discussions over SQM’s strategy. “Now we are all in one company, all in the same boat. I believe we will get along with one another,” said Jiang. Since peaking at $15,750 per tonne in June last year, lithium carbonate prices LIC-FOBSA-BMI have fallen some 17.5 percent to around $13,000 a tonne, but Jiang, who remains bullish on growth in the electric vehicle sector in China, said this had not changed his view on the SQM stake purchase. “I think last year and the year before the lithium price may have been too high,” Jiang said. “It’s impossible for extremely high profits to last,” so it’s natural that prices have since returned to a more sustainable level, he added. Tianqi’s Shenzhen-listed shares have shed more that 40 percent since the acquisition of the SQM stake, while SQM’s shares have fallen more than 30 percent. Jiang attributed the share decline to uncertainty stemming form the ongoing trade war between China and the United States and other external factors."
-28.121737994635442," Chilean miner SQM sees uncertain short-term demand for lithium SANTIAGO, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Chilean miner SQM said on Thursday it foresees strong long-term demand for lithium but offered a short-term prognosis clouded by the entry of new projects into the market and slowing growth of demand for the product this year. The company’s new chief executive, Ricardo Ramos Rodriguez, said in an earnings call he expected sales volume in 2019 to rise slightly from 2018, along with modestly higher average market prices. He said SQM would increase its production of 50,000 metric tonnes (MT) of lithium to a below-market expectation of 60,000 MT for 2019, moving any surplus production into its strategic inventory, for release when market demand merits. “Demand rose in 2018, surprised us again by surpassing 27 percent and is expected to grow at rates above 20 percent in 2019,” he said. “Beyond 2019, demand growth continues to look extremely healthy, making us believe that the 1 million tonnes per year lithium market may happen sooner than originally anticipated.” SQM , the world’s No. 2 producer of lithium, saw its B share price fall by 5.38 percent to 17,250 pesos after the earnings call at midday. In a statement overnight the company said its revenue dipped by 1.6 percent in the fourth quarter to $565.2 million from $574.8 million in the fourth quarter of 2017. Its income dropped to $108.6 million in the fourth quarter from $110.5 million in the year-earlier period. “As was expected, new supplies coming into the market make it more difficult for us to capture the price premium that we had in 2018,” said Ramos. “It is very difficult to predict our sales volume for 2019 and 2020, it depends on supply and demand equilibrium. The timing of the start and the ramp-up of new projects is difficult to assess. We are very optimistic about the demand for lithium in the long-term.” Ramos confirmed heavy rain in northern Chile earlier in February that caused suspension of operations would not affect its ability to fulfill sales contracts. The results come amid concern about softening Chinese demand for lithium, the key ingredient in electric car batteries. Earlier this month, U.S.-based lithium miner Livent that it believed sales to key market China could weaken 2019 because of macroeconomic uncertainty and concerns around electric car subsidies.

Tianqi in December bought a 23.77 percent share in SQM from Canadian fertilizer company Nutrien for $4.1 billion, entitling the Chinese lithium giant to three seats on SQM’s board. A Chilean antitrust court approved the transaction but placed conditions on the sale that limit Tianqi’s access to SQM business secrets. SQM and its top shareholders fought the deal in court and continue to maintain the safeguards do not go far enough to protect its sensitive information from Tianqi. SQM on Wednesday said its board had approved additional measures to safeguard company secrets. The lithium miner told financial regulator CMF that all requests for sensitive information by a board member “appointed by a shareholder who is also a competitor” would first be routed through SQM’s CEO, and then shared with Chilean anti-trust regulators. The CEO would be authorized to deny access to business secrets, but only on the order of the regulator. SQM also said its board would create a new, internal Lithium Committee to review contracts, agreements, and other documents circulated by the board of directors and related to lithium, in order to “process all sensitive information.” Tianqi said in December it had started interviewing candidates in Chile and abroad to take up the three seats on the SQM board in April. Under the initial deal struck with Chilean anti-trust regulators, the Chinese miner cannot name any of its executives or employees. Chinese companies are increasingly scouring the globe for the raw materials necessary to ramp up Chinese production of electric vehicles, which require lithium for their batteries."
-6.64241203110555," Explainer: SQM and Chile reach lithium deal, but Atacama water woes continue SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile's environmental regulator this week approved a $25 million compliance plan by lithium miner SQM SQMa.SN, ending a multi-year investigation by authorities that found the Chilean miner had overdrawn lithium-rich brine from the Atacama salt flat. The case, now resolved, raised questions about how much brine and fresh water was left beneath the Atacama, and how long it would last. Those concerns, and others, still linger. Here’s why: The Salar de Atacama is a high-altitude desert basin in northern Chile that, in 2017, supplied more than one-third of the world’s lithium, a key ingredient in the batteries that power cell phones and electric vehicles. Rain and snow melt have for millennia washed lithium and other metals downslope, percolating into a salty solution that gathers beneath the volcano-rimmed salt flat. Miners pump that brine into shallow rectangular lagoons, where the sun’s ultraviolet rays and the desert air evaporate the water, leaving behind the battery-grade lithium that has put Atacama at the heart of the electric vehicle revolution. Soaring lithium demand has raised questions about whether the salt flat can support current and future levels of production. The world's top lithium miners, SQM and Albemarle Corp ALB.N, share scarce water resources in the basin with BHP's BHP.AX Escondida copper mine, the world's largest, and Antofagasta'sANTO.L smaller Zaldivar copper mine. The government said last year that more of Atacama’s water was being pumped by miners than was being replaced by rain and snowfall. A spokesman for Chile’s DGA water authority told Reuters that a benchmark assessment of the salt flat’s brine and water supply, initially due by December 2018, had been delayed until the second half of 2019. Chile’s water authority last year restricted new water rights in sectors of the salt flat that are currently overdrawn, citing excess pumping by the Zaldivar and Escondida copper mines. Both miners have requested permits that would reduce the amount of water they draw from the flat, but regulators have put these reviews on hold while they assess the water supply, according to Chile Environmental Assessment Service (SEA) filings reviewed by Reuters. The water authority has announced the creation of a drinking-water reserve for the Atacama’s local communities. A spokesman said the project was underway but gave no timeline for completion. Regulators have yet to significantly curtail water extraction by lithium miners. Both Albemarle and SQM say approved expansions will use no more water than already permitted. SQM, however, agreed on Monday to reduce pumping of lithium-rich brine by about 10 percent through May 2020 to remedy several years of overpumping from the salt flat. SQM told Reuters its production plans had already incorporated the commitments made to regulators, and that the reductions in brine extraction would not impact lithium output."
-6.64241203110555," EXPLAINER-SQM and Chile reach lithium deal, but Atacama water woes continue SANTIAGO, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Chile’s environmental regulator this week approved a $25 million compliance plan by lithium miner SQM, ending a multi-year investigation by authorities that found the Chilean miner had overdrawn lithium-rich brine from the Atacama salt flat. The case, now resolved, raised questions about how much brine and fresh water was left beneath the Atacama, and how long it would last. Those concerns, and others, still linger. Here’s why: The Salar de Atacama is a high-altitude desert basin in northern Chile that, in 2017, supplied more than one-third of the world’s lithium, a key ingredient in the batteries that power cell phones and electric vehicles. Rain and snow melt have for millennia washed lithium and other metals downslope, percolating into a salty solution that gathers beneath the volcano-rimmed salt flat. Miners pump that brine into shallow rectangular lagoons, where the sun’s ultraviolet rays and the desert air evaporate the water, leaving behind the battery-grade lithium that has put Atacama at the heart of the electric vehicle revolution. Soaring lithium demand has raised questions about whether the salt flat can support current and future levels of production. The world’s top lithium miners, SQM and Albemarle Corp , share scarce water resources in the basin with BHP’s Escondida copper mine, the world’s largest, and Antofagasta’s smaller Zaldivar copper mine. The government said last year that more of Atacama’s water was being pumped by miners than was being replaced by rain and snowfall. A spokesman for Chile’s DGA water authority told Reuters that a benchmark assessment of the salt flat’s brine and water supply, initially due by December 2018, had been delayed until the second half of 2019. Chile’s water authority last year restricted new water rights in sectors of the salt flat that are currently overdrawn, citing excess pumping by the Zaldivar and Escondida copper mines. Both miners have requested permits that would reduce the amount of water they draw from the flat, but regulators have put these reviews on hold while they assess the water supply, according to Chile Environmental Assessment Service (SEA) filings reviewed by Reuters. The water authority has announced the creation of a drinking-water reserve for the Atacama’s local communities. A spokesman said the project was underway but gave no timeline for completion. Regulators have yet to significantly curtail water extraction by lithium miners. Both Albemarle and SQM say approved expansions will use no more water than already permitted. SQM, however, did agree on Monday to reduce its pumping of lithium-rich brine by approximately 10 percent through May 2020 to remedy several years of overpumping from the salt flat. The company did not respond to requests for comment on how that drop might affect its production of lithium. SQM has previously told regulators it was working to produce more lithium from a given quantity of brine, to maintain output while using less water.

-5.47678248611206," Chilean regulator fines Itau Corpbanca over SQM-linked loans Jan 8 (Reuters) - Chile’s securities regulator said on Tuesday it had fined lender Itaú Corpbanca $8.8 million for exceeding loan limits in extending credit to companies controlling local lithium producer SQM . The Superintendency of Banks and Financial Institutions (SBIF) opened an investigation in 2017 into allegations Itaú Corpbanca had granted excessive loans to SQM holding companies Norte Grande, Potasios de Chile and Pampa Calichera. SBIF said in a statement on Tuesday that two of three fines it initially imposed on Itaú Corpbanca were revoked following a court ruling, but it maintained one charge related to loans the bank extended in 2013, without giving further details. Itau Corpbanca said that it “lamented” the fine and was considering further legal avenues. “Itau Corpbanca reiterates its firm conviction that it acted in compliance with the law in respect to the credit lines subject to these charges,” it said. The bank said the loans in the SBIF investigation were extended to Norte Grande, Potasios de Chile and Pampa Calichera between 2011 and 2015. It did not specify the amounts or give details of the individual loans. Chilean banking laws hold financial institutions to lending no more than 10 percent of a company’s equity or face fines of 10 percent of the amount exceeded. The investigation of the Itau Corpbanca loans follows an investigation into a market manipulation scandal in which SQM’s former chairman Julio Ponce was fined in 2014. That probe, known as “cascadas,” or waterfall in English, for the SQM holding companies involved, including Norte Grande, Potasios de Chile and Pampa Calichera, blighted the country’s record as one of Latin America’s least corrupt economies. Itau Corpbanca, Chile’s fourth-largest commercial bank, was formed through a merger of Brazil’s largest private lender Itau Unibanco Holding SA and Chile’s Corpbanca, in 2014."
-2.0769950260881247," Chile okays lithium miner SQM's plan to remedy water violations SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile’s environmental regulator on Monday approved a $25 million compliance plan by SQM, ending a multi-year investigation by authorities that found the Chilean miner had overdrawn lithium-rich brine from the Atacama salt flat. The plan requires the world’s number two producer of lithium to reduce its extraction of brine. The decision is unlikely to have a major impact on SQM’s total output of the ultralight battery metal, as the reduction represents a relatively small percentage of the total authorized to SQM by regulators. The case has, however, fanned tensions in the arid region of northern Chile, as soaring demand for lithium has forced producers like SQM SQM_pb.SN to compete for scarce water with sprawling copper mines, a booming tourism industry and indigenous communities. Atacama’s salt flat sits in the world’s driest desert and supplies more than one-third of the global supply of lithium, a key ingredient in the batteries that power electric vehicles. The regulator-approved plan includes a new online system to monitor SQM’s extraction rates of brine, which holds lithium in suspension, as well as its use of fresh water used in industrial processes. “The compliance plan presented by SQM prioritizes the protection of the environment over production, and proposes a reduction in the extraction of brine that exceeds the amount over-drawn [by SQM],” said the SMA regulator in a statement. The company has also agreed to shut down one of its freshwater wells in an area where authorities said native algarrobo trees and desert vegetation were dying from lack of water. A spokeswoman for SQM said the company had expected a favorable outcome in the case, adding it was still reviewing the near 100-page resolution. The Atacama region is the most cost-efficient place in the world to mine the battery metal, and SQM and rival Albemarle have each staked much of their future production on the salt flat. The initial charges against SQM, filed by the SMA in 2016, exposed concern by both lithium miners and several government agencies over just how much brine is left beneath the flat, and how long it will last. Chilean regulators last year said they were preparing major new restrictions on the extraction of water from the salt flat to stem an impending water crisis."

The 18-month remediation plan includes a new online system to monitor the Chilean miner’s extraction rates of both brine and fresh water from the salt flat. Atacama, home to top lithium producers SQM and Albemarle, supplies more than one-third of the world’s supply of the ultralight battery metal, but increasing water use by lithium and copper miners has raised concerns about sustainability in the delicate salt flat.

-11.182555537713958," Tesla lithium supplier Kidman settles ownership row over Australian mine MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Kidman Resources, a supplier of lithium to U.S. electric car maker Tesla said on Monday it had settled a court dispute that could have derailed joint development of a mine in Western Australian with Chile’s SQM. In a statement announcing the settlement, Kidman did not specify terms. Court documents show the settlement was reached with private company Phoenix Rise and Jeffrey Hull, a retired geologist. Phoenix Rise and Hull had separately flagged that not enough had been invested enough in the Mount Holland site under government regulations before Kidman acquired it, and applied for the tenement holdings to be forfeited to them. “This settlement resolves this matter completely,” Kidman Chief Executive Martin Donohoe said in a statement which described the settlement sum as “not material”. Phoenix Rise could not be reached for comment and Hull declined to comment. The settlement unlocks payments by SQM that had been on ice during the dispute, and paves the way for development to get back on track. Kidman signed a deal to supply Tesla in May for when its operations are up and running in 2021. The dispute centered on how little money had been spent on the exploration holdings to develop them, prior to Kidman’s purchase of the site in early 2016. The mine is being developed by Covalent Lithium, a 50-50 joint venture between Kidman and SQM. Kidman bought the right to develop the lithium tenements for $3.5 million in early 2016. A year later, SQM invested $110 million into the project to produce lithium carbonate and hydroxide for batteries used in electric vehicles. Under a Western Australian state law to discourage land banking, if a leaseholder has not spent a mininum amount on exploration, another party can petition for the land holding to be forfeited. Shares in Kidman Resources traded up 7 percent at $1.43 by 0328 GMT."
-13.432846709661481," China's Tianqi says stake in Chile lithium miner SQM good for both firms Santiago (Reuters) - The chief executive of China’s Tianqi Lithium Corp said she believes investing in Chile’s lithium miner SQM will bring “long-term benefits” for both companies, despite strict conditions set for its involvement by local anti-trust regulators. Vivian Wu told Chilean newspaper La Tercera on Sunday that Tianqi was looking at other potential investments in Chile as part of its aim to “solidify” its position in the new energy resources market. Last week, Tianqi bought a 23.77 percent share in SQM from Canadian fertilizer company Nutrien for $4.1 billion. The sale comes as Chinese companies are increasingly scouring the globe for the raw materials necessary to ramp up Chinese production of electric vehicles, which require lithium for their batteries. The Tianqi deal faced scrutiny from regulators, competitors and consumer groups amid concerns that it would give Tianqi a near monopoly over the global lithium market. A Chilean antitrust court eventually approved the transaction, placing conditions on the sale that limit Tianqi’s access to SQM business secrets. Further opposition from former chairman Julio Ponce Lerou, who controls SQM’s majority shareholder Pampa Group, was struck down by the country’s Constitutional Court. Wu said Tianqi had been surprised by the Pampa’s Group’s intervention but hoped to build bridges now that Tianqi was a shareholder. “We were surprised to encounter such fierce opposition, even before we officially announced our investment,” she told La Tercera. Wu said she did not know whether to expect further clashes with the Pampa Group. “From our point of view, our plans consist of supporting the existing management team and its efforts to grow the business,” she said. “We trust that once we know the Pampa Group and the SQM administration, our interests and goals will be aligned. “Given how we view the likely growth of the electric vehicle industry, we believe this investment will bring with it very great financial benefits for Tianqi in the long term.” Wu, together with Tianqi president Weiping Jiang, said she will travel to Chile in early 2019 to meet government officials, SQM executives and, she hopes, Pampa Group representatives. The firm has started interviewing candidates “both in Chile and abroad” to take up three seats on the SQM board in April. Under the deal struck with anti-trust regulators, the Chinese miner cannot name any of its executives or employees. Neither the Pampa Group nor SQM could be reached for comment."
-15.446853536229725," Tianqi buys stake in lithium miner SQM from Nutrien for $4.1 billion SANTIAGO (Reuters) - China's Tianqi Lithium Corp 002466.SZ has purchased a 23.77 percent share in Chilean lithium miner SQM SQMa.SN from Canadian fertilizer giant Nutrien NTR.TO, the Chilean stock exchange said on Monday, for a total sale price of $4.066 billion. The sale to Tianqi comes as Chinese companies increasingly scour the globe for the raw materials necessary to ramp up Chinese production of electric vehicles. Lithium is a key component in the batteries that power everything from cellphones to electric vehicles. “A minority stake in SQM is great from our perspective, especially when we look at long term growth and expectations for the lithium industry,” said Ashley Ozols, business development manager for Tianqi, after the deal closed. Tianqi struck a deal earlier this year to buy the stake from Nutrien, the company formed by the merger of Agrium and Potash Corp of Saskatchewan. As part of that deal, Nutrien was required to sell the stake. But the Tianqi deal immediately met with scrutiny from regulators, competitors and consumer groups. Chilean authorities initially expressed concerns that a tie-up between Tianqi and SQM would give the Chinese company a near monopoly over the global lithium market and unprecedented pricing power. Tianqi, through Talison Lithium which it controls, is also in a joint venture with SQM's top competitor, No. 1 lithium producer Albemarle Corp ALB.N in Australia, that owns the world's biggest lithium mine, Greenbushes. A Chilean antitrust court eventually approved the transaction, placing conditions on the sale that limit Tianqi’s access to SQM business secrets and sensitive information. Ozols said Tianqi would nominate three directors to SQM’s board following the Chilean miner’s shareholder meeting in April. Several groups, including SQM itself, filed appeals against the antitrust court’s decision to authorize the deal, but each was struck down, allowing it to proceed. The country’s Constitutional Court in late October also rejected a last-ditch lawsuit by former chairman Julio Ponce Lerou, who controls SQM’s majority shareholder Pampa Group, to overturn the antitrust court’s decision. “We will reach out to the Pampa Group and others and obviously form a good relationship so we can work together for the benefit of all SQM shareholders,” Tianqi’s Ozols said. Nutrien has said it plans to use proceeds from selling stakes in SQM and two other companies to expand its network of farm retail stores in the United States and establish one in Brazil."

SQM , the world’s No. 2 producer of lithium, said the previously announced delays were partly offset by high prices and 25 percent growth in demand in 2018 on sales to producers of electric vehicles. “These two factors have contributed to market prices remaining high during the third quarter,” Chief Executive Officer Patricio de Solminihac said after the company reported that third-quarter profit fell. “It is expected that prices will remain at these levels for the remainder of the year.” Prices so far this year have averaged $16,5000 per tonne, up from $13,500 in 2017, according to the company’s earnings statement. SQM said in October it was facing delays in upgrading its lithium carbonate plant, which processes lithium from Salar de Atacama. The project, first announced in 2017, was designed to upgrade lithium production capacity to 70,000 tonnes. “We are working diligently to resolve these issues as soon as possible,” Solminihac said. “The ramp-up delay will likely impact our fourth-quarter lithium and derivative sales volumes, delaying part of these volumes to the first quarter of 2019.” Revenues for lithium and derivatives during the third quarter dropped 8.9 percent from the third quarter of 2017 amid the production delays, the company said. Total lithium sales volumes this year should be around 45,000 tonnes, Solminihac said. The company earlier this year targeted sales volumes in the lithium business line of 55,000 tonnes in 2018.

The lawsuit, brought by SQM majority shareholder Julio Ponce Lerou, was meant to scuttle an agreement struck between Chile’s antitrust regulators and China-based miner Tianqi. Ponce’s lawyers argued the deal had been struck “practically in secret” and failed to follow due process. But even as shareholders celebrated the court’s rejection of those arguments, which had left the nearly one-quarter SQM stake sale in legal limbo, options remain for Ponce to derail the agreement. SQM and its majority shareholder, the Ponce-controlled Pampa Group, earlier this month asked the antitrust court to reverse its decision, saying it would not protect the companies’ secrets from top competitor Tianqi. Conadecus, a Chilean consumer watchdog, also appealed the decision, saying the deal could raise prices of products powered, in part, by lithium, like cellphones and electric vehicles. Francisco Aguero, a former director of the University of Chile’s Center on Regulation and Competition, said the five-member antitrust court is unlikely to overturn its unanimous decision. A spokeswoman for the antitrust court said there is no timeline for deciding such cases. The appeals are confidential until resolved, she said. “The problem is that the court has already heard their arguments. So now they have to come up with even better arguments,” he said. If such an appeal were unsuccessful, yet another appeal could potentially go as far as Chile’s Supreme Court, said Aguero. “But I don’t see much space for that,” he said. The timing of further legal maneuvering is critical.

In a majority ruling, the court said the lawsuit was ""inadmissible"" and lifted its suspension on the $4.1 billion sale to Tianqi Lithium Corp 002466.SZ of a 24 percent holding in world No. 2 lithium miner SQM SQMa.SN. Tianqi’s lawyers said they were “very satisfied” with the ruling. The initial lawsuit, brought by SQM majority shareholder Julio Ponce Lerou, was intended to scuttle an agreement struck between Chile’s antitrust regulators and Tianqi. Ponce’s lawyers argued the deal had been struck “practically in secret” and that it failed to protect SQM’s corporate secrets from top competitor Tianqi. The decision, passed by three to two votes, removes yet another obstacle for Canadian fertilizer producer Nutrien NTR.TO, which owns the near one-quarter stake in SQM and must sell its shares by April 2019 in order to comply with regulatory requirements put in place by Indian and Chinese authorities following a prior merger. The court’s decision is final and not subject to appeal but one legal hurdle remains. Ponce’s Pampa Group, which controls SQM, earlier this month filed an additional appeal with Chile’s TDLC antitrust court. Nutrien has previously argued that the “real objective” of Ponce’s legal maneuvers is to block the sale to Tianqi and force Nutrien to “miss its deadline with Indian and Chinese regulators.” Pampa has said it is concerned Tianqi, which controls Talison Lithium, a joint venture with No. 1 lithium producer Albemarle Corp ALB.N in Australia, could share secrets with its U.S.-based competitor and neighbor in Chile's lithium-rich Salar de Atacama.

The top shareholder in SQM <SQMa.SN, SQM_pb.SN> argued before the court earlier this week that Chile’s antitrust court failed to follow due process in approving a settlement between Tianqi and Chilean regulators. Baldo Prokurica told journalists that he was confident of the decisions taken by the country’s antitrust regulators and was certain the Constitutional Court would agree. “The Constitutional Court is a mature entity, with a long history and I am certain that it will not lend itself to delaying this process,” he said. Lawyers for Tianqi have accused SQM’s Pampa Group, which is the majority shareholder in the Chilean miner, of seeking to delay Tianqi’s purchase of the quarter stake in order to force the shares to be sold piecemeal, thus preserving Pampa’s dominance of SQM’s board. The Constitutional Court will hold an “extraordinary session” to decide on how to proceed in the case at 3 p.m. (1800 GMT) on Thursday. It could decide to hear the case in full and suspend the sale, potentially putting it at risk, hear the case in full but allow the sale to go ahead, or decline to hear the case further, the court has said.

4.307162962386395," Nutrien vows to 'protect interests' over threat to SQM sale: paper SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Canada’s Nutrien, whose attempt to sell its stake in Chilean lithium miner SQM to China’s Tianqi has been stalled by a row about competitive risks, vowed to “protect its interests” in an interview with a Chilean newspaper published on Sunday. Michael Webb, the executive vicepresident of fertilizer company Nutrien NTR.TO, accused Julio Ponce, SQM's SQMa.SNSQM_pb.SN largest shareholder, of prioritizing ""personal benefit"" by asking a court to block the $4 billion deal. “As an SQM shareholder, we want nothing but the best for the company,” he told El Mercurio. “If Mr Ponce takes action that harms us and any other shareholder, we will look to protect ourselves.” He did not elaborate. The sale of Nutrien's 24 percent stake in SQM was approved by Chile's antitrust regulator, with some conditions to curb Tianqi's 002466.SZ influence. But former SQM chairman Ponce, via his investment firm Pampa Group, has said that the deal would still give Tianqi, a top competitor, “unrestricted access” to “confidential and sensitive information.” Webb said he will attend a Constitutional Court hearing into the case on Monday, which will be closely watched by those invested in lithium, one of the world’s hottest commodities and a key component of electric car batteries. He said the sale was “in the best interests of SQM” and expressed hope that the deal could close by the end of year. Nutrien has been required by Indian and Chinese regulators to offload its SQM share by April, following its merger with a rival fertilizer company. Webb accused Ponce of using the Chilean courts “for his personal benefit” to maintain his dominance of SQM. “Acting in your own interests in these matters means you are prejudicing (shareholder) investments and that is unfortunate. I would urge him to look beyond himself,” he said. Neither Nutrien or Ponce responded to a request for comment."

The court has agreed to hear initial arguments in the case on Oct. 22. Here are next steps and what it could mean for Tianqi’s efforts to complete a deal. The lawsuit was filed by controlling shareholder and former SQM chairman Julio Ponce Lerou, via his investment vehicles Pampa Calichera, Potasios de Chile and Global Mining, collectively known as the Pampa Group. Ponce has been a key figure in SQM since it was privatized in the 1980s under his former father-in-law, dictator Augusto Pinochet. The lawsuit said a previous anti-trust court decision clearing the deal did not give adequate time for shareholders to review an agreement between Tianqi and regulators. The agreement aimed to limit the exchange of information between Tianqi and SQM, and curbed Tianqi’s role on SQM’s board. Ponce objects to how the agreement was struck and what it does to limit competitive risks. In the filings, his Pampa Group said it feared the transaction would give Tianqi, a top competitor, “unrestricted access” to all of the Chilean miner’s “confidential and sensitive information.” Tianqi is also in a joint venture with No. 1 lithium producer Albemarle Corp in Australia, where together they own the world’s biggest lithium mine. The Pampa Group said it was especially concerned that Tianqi’s relationship would allow Albemarle, a close neighbor in Chile’s lithium-rich Salar de Atacama, to obtain its business and operating secrets. Chile’s Constitutional Court has seen relatively few cases like this one, challenging decisions made by the country’s 15-year old antitrust court. Francisco Aguero, a former director of the University of Chile’s Center on Regulation and Competition, said the Constitutional Court had not previously contradicted findings by the antitrust court. But he said the Constitutional Court - which has recently been bogged down by an increased caseload - may have been a good choice if Ponce’s intent was to stall the sale of Nutrien’s stake to Tianqi. “This could really paralyze this process,” he said, adding that it was a “procedural triumph” for Ponce to have obtained a quick audience with the court. “It’s worth mentioning that Ponce Lerou, in past cases, has done well in the Constitutional Court,” he said. Five Constitutional Court judges will hear arguments from lawyers for all parties in the case on Oct. 22. They can then decline to hear the case further or opt for a fuller hearing involving 10 judges. If they go ahead, the judges meet again behind closed doors, before issuing their final decision in writing at a later date. While the process could be expedited, it gave no timeline on a ruling. They can either declare the contested agreement constitutional and lift the suspension, allowing the deal to proceed, or declare it unconstitutional. In that case, all parties would have to return to the antitrust court and forge another agreement, or overturn the deal if they cannot. The Constitutional Court’s ruling is final and cannot be appealed to any higher Chilean court. The Canadian fertilizer company - formerly Potash Corp of Saskatchewan - must offload its stake in SQM to meet regulatory requirements following its merger with a rival fertilizer company to create Nutrien. Chinese and Indian regulators have given Nutrien until April 19, 2019 to sell its shares in SQM, which is also an important producer of agricultural chemicals. The clock is ticking. Nutrien told the Constitutional Court that the “real objective” of Ponce’s suit was to block the deal and force Nutrien to “miss its deadline with Indian and Chinese regulators.” “Blocking this deal could cost Nutrien hundreds of millions of dollars,” it said. In a hearing before Chile’s antitrust court, a lawyer for Tianqi said Ponce was seeking to block the deal to maintain his own dominance at SQM. Ponce stepped down as president of SQM in 2015 but retained his shares in the company. “If this is not approved, Nutrien would have to sell its stake on the bourse, atomizing the holding,” said lawyer Claudio Lizana. If the shares were sold piecemeal, Ponce would not have to contend with another “weighty shareholder,” Lizana said.

-1.1496676624397626," Chilean court freezes sale of stake in lithium giant SQM to Tianqi SANTIAGO (Reuters) - A Chilean court on Thursday suspended the sale of a coveted stake in lithium producer SQM SQM_pb.SN to China's Tianqi Lithium Corp, saying it will consider a lawsuit filed by the Chilean company's controlling shareholders, who oppose the deal. The lawsuit, filed on Wednesday, alleges a previous anti-trust court decision did not give shareholders adequate time to review the agreement between Tianqi and regulators, allowing the Chinese miner to purchase a 24 percent stake in the world’s No. 2 producer of lithium, a metal used to make batteries for electric vehicles. The agreement is intended to limit the exchange of commercially sensitive information between Tianqi and SQM, though detractors say it does not go far enough. It would give Tianqi the right to have at least three of the company’s eight board seats, fueling concerns that Tianqi would have access to internal SQM documents that it would then use to its own advantage. Pampa Calichera, Potasios de Chile and Global Mining - which together control a majority stake in SQM - asked Chile’s constitutional court on Wednesday to “urgently suspend” the agreement, saying the anti-trust court had approved it last week “practically in secret.” The shareholders, known collectively as the Pampa Group, are controlled by SQM’s former chairman, Julio Ponce, who has been a driving force behind SQM since it was privatized in the 1980s under his former father-in-law, dictator Augusto Pinochet. Tianqi said in a statement that the court’s decision to review the appeal was “purely a formality.” “What comes now is a discussion about the admissibility of the lawsuit, in which we will put forward solid arguments to see the suit thrown out,” Tianqi said. The constitutional court said it would hear arguments in the case on Oct. 22. SQM has long objected to the deal on the grounds it did not go far enough to limit Tianqi’s access to corporate secrets and sensitive information. Chile’s previous government had also tried to block the Tianqi deal before it left office in March, amid concerns a tie-up would give the Chinese company control of 70 percent of the global lithium market and unprecedented pricing power. Tianqi, through Talison Lithium which it controls, is also in a joint venture with No. 1 lithium producer Albemarle Corp in Australia, where they own the world’s biggest lithium mine, Greenbushes. Beijing is aggressively promoting electric vehicles to combat air pollution and help China’s domestic carmakers leapfrog the combustion engine to build global brands. The agreement between Chile’s antitrust regulator and Tianqi stipulates that the Chinese miner cannot name any of its executives or employees to SQM’s board, and requires it notify regulators of any future, lithium-related deal struck with either SQM or Albemarle. Chile’s antitrust regulator launched its investigation in June, shortly after Tianqi said it would buy the stake in SQM for $4.1 billion."

An attorney representing SQM told Chile’s anti-trust court, which must approve the settlement between the regulator and Tianqi, that the measures agreed upon were not sufficient to limit the Chinese miners access to SQM’s commercially-sensitive information. “There is not much hope that these efforts to mitigate the effects of the deal will achieve the desired result,” said Maria Isabel Diaz Velasco, a lawyer for SQM. Chile’s government asked regulators in March to scrutinize Tianqi’s bid to buy 24 percent of SQM for $4.1 billion, a move which would give it a coveted stake in one of the world’s top producers of lithium, a key component in batteries that power everything from cell phones to electric vehicles. In the complaint, Chile’s government said the deal would distort the global lithium market. Tianqi’s interest in SQM comes as Beijing aggressively promotes electric vehicles to combat air pollution and help China’s domestic carmakers leapfrog combustion engine brands. The settlement agreed upon last Friday by Chilean anti-trust regulator (FNE) and Tianqi would see the transaction approved, but with restrictions. Tianqi, whose stake in the company would entitle it to appoint three members to SQM’s board, would be barred from nominating its own executives or employees. The Chinese miner would also be required to notify regulators of any future, lithium-related deal struck with either SQM or top-competitor Albemarle. The FNE said it believed the deal would “sufficiently preserve free competition in the lithium industry” while Tianqi said it had agreed to the measures “in a clear sign of respect for Chile and its institutions.” On Thursday, Tianqi’s representative Claudio Lizana said controlling shareholder Ponce Lerou, the former son-in-law of ex-dictator Augusto Pinochet, was seeking to force the stake’s current owner, Canadian fertilizer company Nutrien Ltd, to sell it piecemeal on the open market. The court heard further objections to the settlement from a group representing lithium consumers, and representatives for Pampa Group, controlled by Lerou, SQM’s former president. “They’ve given Tianqi the gift of a deal that allows it to enter into ownership of a competitor,” the lawyer for Ponce’s said.

The settlement stipulates that Tianqi can not name one of its executives or employees to SQM’s board, and requires that the Chinese miner notify regulators of any future, lithium-related deal struck with either SQM or top-competitor Albemarle. “The measures agreed upon...are intended to limit Tianqi’s access to commercially sensitive information held by SQM,” the FNE said in a statement. Tianqi said in a statement on Saturday that it has agreed to comply with the conditions, which mark an important next step in the process of finalizing the investment agreement. “Tianqi Lithium believes these remedies and conditions go beyond what the law in Chile requires, but has agreed to comply with them as a clear signal of its respect for Chile and its institutions, as well as its commitment to ensure the highest level of corporate governance practices are put in place at SQM,” Tianqi said. Tianqi said it expects the transaction will be completed within the expected timeframe and close in the fourth quarter of this year.

Chile’s government under former President Michelle Bachelet had requested regulators scrutinize the transaction, alleging the deal would distort the global lithium market. The FNE said on Friday that its investigation had determined that Tianqi’s purchase of 25.86 percent of the Chilean miner “could generate anti-competitive effects.” After presenting the results of its investigation to Tianqi, the FNE said, the Chinese miner had responded with a series of measures to mitigate those effects, and that together, the two parties had reached an agreement that “sufficiently preserves free competition in the lithium industry.” Following the announcement, Tianqi said in a statement it had agreed to the measures “in a clear sign of respect for Chile and its institutions”. “With this decision...the company is confident that it will complete the transaction within the timeframe originally anticipated,” the statement said.

-0.7993251120578178," Chile's SQM expects lithium prices to dip in second half SANTIAGO, Aug 24 (Reuters) - Chilean lithium miner SQM said it forecast lithium prices dropping as much as 10 percent in the second half of the year compared to the first but stressed it saw no problems with potential water restrictions in the Atacama salt flat where it operates. Chief executive Patricio de Solminihac said on a second-quarter earnings call that Australian lithium concentrate being converted in China for use in car and cell phone batteries was responsible for downward “price pressure.” “There’s consensus the market will continue to grow, but on supply there’s more uncertainty,” he said. “We see that the price will be slightly lower in the second half of the year, although still significantly higher than in the second half of last year.” SQM , which is also an important producer of plant fertilizer and iodine, said in its earnings report for the second quarter, released on Thursday, that its overall revenue had increased 26 percent compared to the same period last year. It projected that lithium sales would increase 50 per cent in the second half of the year compared to the first. On Thursday, Reuters reported that Chile’s water regulator said the government had significantly over-promised on water rights and it was preparing major new restrictions on water extraction from the Salar de Atacama basin, where both SQM and its rival Albemarle operate, along with major copper mines. Solminihac said SQM held less than 4 percent of all the water rights in the salar, and he saw no risk of lithium production being impacted by the regulator’s plans. “On fresh water rights, we don’t see any effect on our small quantity of water and according to our production line, we expect to increase our production without a need for more fresh water than what we have,” he said. However, he said potential restrictions on brine extraction would mean that the company would produce less potassium chloride, used for making potash. SQM said earlier this month that it would overtake Albemarle as the world’s top producer of lithium by 2022, boosting its production capacity that year to 28 percent of the world’s total versus the U.S.-based Albemarle’s 16 percent."

The deal also stipulates that Ganfeng will pay SQM an additional $50 million if the project’s goals for selling lithium are met, SQM said in a statement. The transaction is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter, SQM added. Canada’s Lithium Americas Corp (LAC) said in a separate statement that its stake in Cauchari-Olaroz would rise to 62.5 percent from 50 percent now as a result of the deal. Ganfeng, which will own 37.5 percent of the project, also agreed to give LAC a $100 million loan, allowing it to pay for its part in initial capital expenditures. The shake-up in ownership in the project in northern Argentina comes as China has been aggressively promoting electric vehicles, whose batteries use lithium, to help domestic carmakers build global brands and to reduce air pollution. Earlier this year, China’s Tianqi Lithium Corp said it was buying a 24 percent stake in SQM for $4.1 billion. The sale has not yet been approved by Chile’s antitrust regulator. The Cauchari-Olaroz project is expected to start production in 2020."

SQM Vice President Daniel Jimenez said in a presentation at a Santiago forum on lithium that capacity increases at its Chile operations, together with new projects in Australia and Argentina, would help put the company in the top slot.

Albemarle did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Both SQM and Albemarle are making preparations to ramp up production in Chile’s Salar de Atacama, one of the world’s richest lithium flats, amid a sharp spike in global demand. SQM said in July it was seeking government approval for a $450 million expansion of its lithium carbonate plant, which could more than double its capacity to produce lithium carbonate to 180,000 tons a year by 2020. Albemarle in March secured permits from Chilean authorities to boost production to as much as 145,000 tons of lithium carbonate annually through 2043. The Charlotte, North Carolina-based Albemarle reported earlier this week that its quarterly earnings had tripled on rising sales, though its shares had lost nearly a third of their value since January on concerns new lithium projects could flood the market with fresh supply. SQM’s Jimenez also said in the presentation that global production capacity for the key ingredient in electric vehicle batteries would more than triple in four years, reaching 735,000 tonnes by 2022. Australia will increase its share of production capacity to 46 percent by 2022, Jimenez said, cementing its position as the world’s top-producing country of the white metal. Chile’s market share is expected to drop from 37 percent in 2017 to 30 percent in 2022, according to the presentation."
-8.75439852978334," Part-owner of Chile lithium producer SQM sells $275 mln bond SANTIAGO, July 27 (Reuters) - Chile’s Pampa Calichera , one of the companies through which businessman Julio Ponce holds his ownership stake in lithium producer SQM , said it sold bonds in the local market on Friday for the equivalent of $275 million. The bond had an annual interest rate of 4.5 percent and a duration of 15 years, Calichera said in a note to the market regulator. SQM is one of the world’s largest producers of lithium, a key mineral for electric car batteries. Ponce, a former son-in-law of late Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, was barred from decision making at the company as part of a contract with the government allowing the firm to boost lithium output.

-8.50065247075079," CORRECTED-CEO of Chilean lithium miner SQM resigns (Corrects last paragraph to Genlith from Glenlith) SANTIAGO, July 25 (Reuters) - Chilean lithium miner SQM on Wednesday night announced the resignation of its chief executive Patricio de Solminihac. SQM said in a emailed statement that Solminihac, 63, who has been at the helm of one of the world’s top lithium producers for three years and with the company for 30 years, was leaving “for personal reasons” on Dec. 31 this year. He will be replaced by Ricardo Ramos Rodríguez, the current vice president of corporate services and the company’s chief financial officer. Solminihac formed part of a management team that saw SQM’s assets grow to $4.3 bln from $152 mln, said Alberto Salas, the company’s president. “Patricio has been part of a an executive team and board that generated significant value for shareholders, workers, communities and the country,” he added. “We regret his resignation and we appreciate his dedication and commitment over the years.” Last week SQM began the process of seeking government approval for a $450 million expansion of its lithium carbonate plant in Chile’s northern Salar de Atacama, which could more than double its production as demand rises for the key element in the manufacturing of batteries for cell phones and electric cars. Solminihac also sought to diversify the company’s lithium sources with the Cauchari-Olaroz project in Argentina and the Mt. Holland lithium project in Australia. The firm has faced controversy this year after having been forced to perform a u-turn last month over the appointment of its controversial former president Julio Ponce Lerou as an advisor, despite instruction by the Chilean government that he distance himself from the company as part of a settlement of a disagreement over mining royalties. The purchase by Chinese miner Tianqi Lithium Corp’s in May of a 24 percent stake in SQM is at present being studied by Chile’s antitrust regulator FNE. Solminihac’s resignation was announced on the same day as the resignation of SQM’s chief rival Albermarle’s executive overseeing lithium mining in Chile. U.S. firm Albemarle Corp said John Mitchell would leave at the end of the month, according to an internal memo reviewed by Reuters. Privately held clean energy investor Genlith Inc said later on Wednesday that it had hired Mitchell to run its Chilean cobalt subsidiary.

-12.78877465835668," Chile's SQM seeks approval for $450 million lithium plant expansion SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chilean miner SQM on Wednesday began the process of seeking government approval for a $450 million expansion of its lithium carbonate plant, which could more than double its production as demand rises for the key element in the manufacturing of batteries. SQM said in an environmental impact statement that the upgrade planned for its Salar del Carmen facility would increase production of lithium carbonate to 180,000 tons a year from 70,000 tonnes through two phases with the goal of being operational in 2020. Global manufacturers of batteries and electric cars are looking to secure their supplies against the increasing value of lithium. “In the first operational phase, production will be increased to 110,000 tonnes a year by increasing the current operating capacity of our equipment and processes,” said the miner. The company said the second phase of expansion - called Lithium Carbonate Plant 3 - would see new equipment installed and existing equipment modified to increase production. In January, the company entered into an agreement with the Chilean government that ended a long dispute over a key lithium deposit and enabled it to increase its production quota in the vital Salar de Atacama. SQM said one the most important aspects of its expansion project would be to optimize its use of scarce water resources in the area of northern Chile where it operates by using the same amount it does now even with increased production levels. The company plans to begin the lithium plant project at the end of this year."
-6.986200440197236," Chile antitrust regulator to probe Tianqi purchase of SQM stake SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile’s antitrust regulator FNE said on Friday it would open an investigation into the effects on the market of Chinese miner Tianqi Lithium Corp’s purchase last month of a 24 percent stake in SQM, one of the world’s top lithium producers. The FNE’s decision comes three months after Chile´s government under former President Michelle Bachelet requested regulators investigate a potential fusion between the two lithium miners, alleging it would distort the global market for the key ingredient in the batteries that power electric vehicles. China’s Tianqi said in May it would buy nearly a quarter of SQM from Canada-based fertilizer company Nutrien Ltd for $4.1 billion. “In our investigation, the FNE will seek to verify, or dismiss, whether anti-competitive risks in Chile ... are plausible, and of a magnitude that makes them relevant,” the FNE said in a statement. Tianqi said it will continue to cooperate with regulators. “We don´t believe this transaction implies competitive risks, but obviously the FNE needed more time to complete its investigation,” Tianqi legal adviser Claudio Lizana said in a statement. The sale, if approved by regulators, would leave Tianqi just shy of a controlling stake in SQM and likely entitle the company to appoint three seats on its board. Chile development agency Corfo, which oversees SQM’s lithium leases in the Salar de Atacama, said in a complaint filed with the FNE in March that the deal would give Tianqi and SQM control of 70 percent of the global lithium market. Tianqi’s interest in SQM comes as Beijing aggressively promotes electric vehicles to combat air pollution and help China’s domestic carmakers leapfrog the combustion engine to build global brands. The FNE said information gathering to determine admissibility of the case was insufficient to gauge the antitrust risks, prompting its decision to launch a full investigation. “There is no time limit to determine the duration of the investigations the FNE conducts,” the statement said. The timing may prove critical. Chinese and Indian regulators have given Nutrien - formerly Potash Corp of Saskatchewan - 18 months from Nov. 2, 2017, to offload its stake in SQM to meet regulatory requirements after its merger with a rival fertilizer company. If the FNE determines the purchase presents antitrust risks, it can take the case before Chile´s TDLC antitrust court, or reach a settlement with the parties, which would also need the court’s approval. If no such risks exist, the case would be closed, the FNE statement said."

-10.961619484636941," Chile creates committee to oversee lithium contracts SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Chile’s government said on Monday it was creating a committee to supervise lithium contracts the state has with local miner SQM and U.S.-based Albemarle Corp., deals that are key to positioning the country as a top producer of the white metal. The committee will aim to ensure concession agreements that state development agency Corfo has with SQM SQM_pb.SN and Albemarle Corp in the Atacama salt flats are followed. “There are many contractual clauses that require decisions on prices, quantities and allocation of resources,” Economy Minister Jose Valente told journalists after a Corfo board meeting. “This committee will be seeing how they develop and recommend to Corfo’s board the fulfillment of those contracts in the appropriate manner,” he added. SQM is the world’s second biggest lithium producer after Albemarle Corp. Chile is home to half of the world’s reserves of lithium, a key ingredient in rechargeable batteries that power everything from cell phones and tablets to electric vehicles. The announcement comes a week after SQM appointed its former Chairman Julio Ponce as a strategic adviser despite an agreement with the state that he distance himself from the firm. Finance Minister Felipe Larrain said on Wednesday the appointment was “imprudent” and that the contract drawn up between SQM and the government to end a royalties dispute would have to be checked to determine if the appointment of Ponce as adviser was compliant."
-13.928969366795002," SQM pick of ex-Chairman Ponce as adviser 'imprudent': Chile finance minister (Reuters) - Chile’s finance minister on Wednesday described as “imprudent” the appointment by lithium miner SQM of its former Chairman Julio Ponce as a strategic adviser, in light of an agreement with the state that he distance himself from the firm. SQM SQM_pb.SNSQMa.SN, the world's biggest exporter of lithium carbonate, confirmed on Tuesday that it had retained Ponce's services, along with those of his brother Eugenio. The move has sparked criticism from politicians from both the governing coalition and opposition, as well as the business community. Finance Minister Felipe Larrain said that the contract drawn up between SQM and the government to end a royalties dispute would have to be checked to determine if the appointment of Ponce as adviser was compliant. “It’s a complex situation and seems to be an imprudent move,” he told journalists at a news conference on Wednesday. “We need to check whether it’s a violation of the contract or the spirit of the contract from the government’s point of view. We will protect the interests of the Chilean state.” Ponce, a former son-in-law of late Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, is a controversial figure in Chile. He has held power at SQM since it was privatized under Pinochet in the 1980s and is still the largest shareholder. In 2014, he was fined for market manipulation. The firm’s current president, Alberto Salas, said in a statement on Tuesday that the board took the unanimous decision to appoint Ponce and his brother after an “exhaustive analysis” and because of the pair’s “extensive business experience and technical know-how.” State development agency Corfo, which oversees Chile’s lithium leases, earlier this year inked a deal with SQM that increased the miner’s quota of the highly prized metal in the Salar de Atacama, but stipulated that Ponce remove himself and his family from decision-making at the firm. Corfo on Wednesday said an external law firm it hired had reviewed the contract, as well as emails sent during the negotiations, and found that the ban did not apply to “advisors.” “The spirit of the parties was to not broaden the prohibition to the role of the advisor,” Corfo said in a statement. “We will exert strict oversight to make sure that SQM’s decision to hire Julio Ponce Lerou and Eugenio Ponce Lerou as advisors does not mean that they participate in decision-making.”"

SQM , one of the world’s largest producers of lithium and fertilizers, said it would be ready to produce as many as 180,000 metric tonnes of lithium in Chile’s Salar de Atacama salt flat by early 2021, up from 48,000 tonnes currently. “We believe that with demand growing close to 20 percent this year and next year, the market will be able to absorb this additional supply,” said CEO Patricio de Solminihac in a statement accompanying the company’s first quarter results. “Our strategy is to have the installed capacity to react to market demand.” The company said it would invest $75 million this year to increase production to 70,000 tonnes at Atacama, its flagship lithium deposit in northern Chile. “2018 sales volumes in the business line should reach approximately 55,000 MT (metric tonnes) as we ramp up the current production. These additional sales volumes should be seen during the second half of 2018,” the company said in a statement. Lithium and its byproducts accounted for approximately 61 percent of SQM’s gross profit in the first quarter, the company said. Demand exceeded supply, it added, sharply boosting prices in early 2018 to $16,400 per tonne from $13,500 in the fourth quarter of 2017. “We believe that this price pressure will continue throughout the first half of the year,” de Solminihac said. The second stage of SQM’s expansion plans in Chile would increase capacity to 120,000 tonnes, 20,000 tonnes more than previously anticipated, the statement said. “The second stage of the expansion in the Salar de Atacama will be completed in the next 18 months with a total investment of US$200 million,” de Solminihac said in the statement. The final stage would boost production capacity to 180,000 tonnes with a price tag of $250 million. It was not immediately clear if that was in addition to the $200 million. SQM earlier today reported earnings of $113.8 million in the first quarter of 2018, up 10 percent, on growth in its lithium business.

The sale, however, still faces scrutiny by an anti-trust regulator in Chile as it would leave Tianqi just shy of a controlling stake in SQM, the world’s second-largest lithium producer, and likely entitle the company to appoint three seats on its board. Tianqi, which is already building a major lithium processor in Western Australia, said it will buy 62.5 million SQM A shares for $65 each from Canada-based fertilizer company Nutrien Ltd NTR.TO. Tianqi’s interest comes as Beijing aggressively promotes electric vehicles to combat air pollution and help China’s domestic carmakers leapfrog the combustion engine to build global brands. Chile’s former government in March filed a complaint with the FNE antitrust regulator seeking to block the sale of the shares to Tianqi, alleging a potential fusion between the two lithium giants would distort the global lithium market and could give China the upper hand in a global race to secure resources for electric vehicles. Chile’s Economy Minister Jose Valente told Reuters following the announcement that the government would respect an eventual ruling by the country’s regulators on the deal. “We have strong laws on free competition...The FNE must deliberate and give its opinion with respect to (this deal) and we will abide by their decision,” Valente said. He added that the Chilean government welcomed foreign investment and would not discriminate by nationality. The FNE regulator has until August, with the possibility of extensions, to decide whether to launch a full investigation into the case. Nutrien Chief Executive Chuck Magro said at a BMO investor conference in New York that he was confident the deal would not trigger antitrust concerns and would be completed by the fourth quarter. Corfo, the Chilean agency that filed the complaint to block the sale of the stake to Tianqi, said in a statement it was awaiting the FNE’s decision and would cooperate in its investigation. The FNE regulator responsible for ruling on the complaint declined to comment. Reuters reported earlier this week that Tianqi and SQM were in talks for a deal. Tianqi had been circling SQM since 2016. Earlier on Thursday, Australia's Kidman Resources Ltd KDR.AX said it would supply lithium for Tesla Inc's TSLA.O electric car batteries.

Chengdu-based Tianqi, which is building the world's biggest lithium processor in Western Australia, is looking to sign a deal to acquire the stake in SQM from Canadian fertilizer company Nutrien Ltd NTR.TO, the people said. Nutrien, formed by the merger of Agrium and Potash Corp of Saskatchewan, must sell its stake in SQM by next March as part of a commitment to regulators approving the deal. Nutrien owns about 30 percent of SQM, which also has significant fertilizer production. The more actively traded B-shares of SQM SQM_pb.SN jumped as much 6.8 percent to a four-month high after the Reuters report. Nutrien shares extended gains, hitting a near two-month high, and were up 2.3 percent at C$66.19. Based on SQM’s market value of $14.8 billion at Monday’s close, Tianqi would pay a roughly 22 percent premium for the shares in the world’s lowest-cost producer of lithium. Tianqi’s interest comes as Beijing aggressively promotes electric vehicles - lithium is a key ingredient in rechargeable batteries - to combat air pollution and help domestic carmakers leapfrog the combustion engine to build global brands. But the SQM stake purchase could hit snags. Chile’s former government in March asked antitrust regulator FNE to block the stake sale to Chinese firms, saying it would distort the global lithium market and give China an unfair advantage in securing strategic resources. FNE has until August, with the possibility of extensions, to determine whether to launch an investigation. China’s trade representative to Chile told Reuters last week that Beijing suspects other countries have lobbied Chile to block Chinese firms from purchasing the SQM stake. Tianqi, which is in talks with several institutional investors and banks for financing, plans to fund the deal through bank loans, mezzanine loans and its own working capital, the people said. Chinese state-run conglomerate Citic Group [CITIC.UL] and its unit China Citic Bank 601998.SS are considering providing part of the capital for the stake acquisition, they added. “It is inconvenient to disclose any details because of business secrets,” CITIC Bank said in an emailed statement in response to a Reuters request for comment. Chinese private equity firm GSR Capital has also been vying for the stake, two separate people familiar with the matter said. It was not clear if GSR was raising the financing for a deal of its own. SQM, Tianqi, GSR, and Citic Group did not respond to requests for comment. Nutrien declined to comment. All the people declined to be identified as the deal details were private, and they cautioned that there is no certainty that a deal would be reached. Nutrien said last week it expects to announce the sale of its stake in SQM by the end of the second quarter. If the deal goes through, Tianqi would likely secure three seats on SQM’s eight-member board, one of the sources said. SQM currently has annual lithium carbonate production capacity of 48,000 tonnes in Chile, which it will expand to 70,000 tonnes by mid-2018 and to 100,000 tonnes in 2019. Shenzhen-listed Tianqi, which has a market capitalization of $9.5 billion, plans to raise at least $1 billion from a Hong Kong float this year, IFR reported. Part of the proceeds would be used to finance its investments. Tianqi makes a variety of raw materials for the battery industry.

Demand for the metal is set to grow by 600,000-800,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate equivalent over the next 10 years, Daniel Jimenez, senior commercial vice president at SQM, said. Lithium carbonate is a chemical used to make batteries for electric vehicles. “So a lot of capital needs to be put on the table for this to materialise, which is a challenge,” Jimenez told the Metal Bulletin Battery Materials Conference in Shanghai. Some original equipment manufacturers, such as battery producers and some car manufacturers, “have started to get involved in lithium projects, financing or co-financing the development,” he added, citing Toyota Motor Corp and Great Wall Motor as examples. “This is a trend we will probably continue seeing because there is a legitimate concern on the side of the vehicle manufacturers” over the reliability of supply sources, Jimenez said. In addition, the lithium industry “has shown a poor track record of delivering projects on time,” he added. SQM, officially known as Sociedad Quimica y Minera de Chile, currently has annual lithium carbonate production capacity of 48,000 tonnes in Chile, which it will expand to 70,000 tonnes by mid-2018 and to 100,000 tonnes in 2019, Jimenez said. The company also has 6,000 tonnes of annual capacity for lithium hydroxide, used in high-nickel content batteries, which will more than double to 13,500 tonnes by June this year. Under a deal struck with Chilean development agency Corfo in January, SQM will be able to produce up to 216,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate a year through 2025 if it makes certain investments and obtains the relevant permits. However, the company has not yet decided whether to go beyond 100,000 tonnes. Corfo has also asked antitrust regulators to block the sale of a 32 percent stake in SQM held by Nutrien Ltd to Chinese lithium producer Tianqi Lithium. Outside Chile, SQM has a joint venture with Lithium Americas at the Cauchari-Olaroz project in Argentina, which has a targeted production capacity of 25,000 tonnes of lithium carbonate per year and is expected to come on line around 2020. In Australia, SQM partners Kidman Resources at the 40,000 tonne per year Mount Holland project, which is scheduled to start producing either lithium carbonate or lithium hydroxide in 2021."
