-16.68156915203541," Adecco Group appoints Pearson's Williams as CFO BERLIN/LONDON (Reuters) - Swiss staffing firm Adecco Group ADEN.S on Friday said Pearson Plc's PSON.L Coram Williams would take over as chief financial officer from mid-2020. Williams has been CFO since 2015 at Pearson, whose shares have plunged nearly 50% since early 2019. At Adecco Group, he will succeed Hans Ploos van Amstel, who is leaving in June after almost five years. “I am looking forward to .... building on the great work of Hans to further advance the group’s transformation, harness the significant opportunities ahead to drive profitable growth, and deliver clear value for stakeholders,” Williams said in a statement. Adecco wished Ploos van Amstel well, saying he had helped improve the company’s cost structure, adjust its portfolio and roll out digital offerings. Williams’ departure from Pearson was announced on Thursday alongside a profit warning that sent its shares to their lowest level in more than a decade. It comes a month after CEO John Fallon said he would retire this year. The British education group has been caught off guard by the speed of the switch from physical textbooks to digital products, resulting in a string of profit warnings. Williams will be succeeded at Pearson by his deputy, Sally Johnson, Pearson said."

-6.44023275826364," Pearson shares down as core U.S. business revenue stumbles (Reuters) - Pearson Plc PSON.L said revenue at a key U.S. business fell 5 percent and forecast a possible similar drop next year as the education publisher undergoes a major restructuring to focus on boosting its digital content. The FTSE 100 company has struggled to grow its U.S. higher education courseware (HECW) as students have moved away from new textbooks for second-hand copies and digital learning materials. After a few tumultuous years, Pearson had pinned its restructuring hopes on the business, calling it last year the “single biggest opportunity” to gain share through its digital transformation. But now, Pearson forecast U.S. HECW revenue, which accounts for less than 25 percent of total company revenue, to be flat to down as much as 5 percent for 2019. Liberum analyst Ian Whittaker said it would most likely be at the lower end. Credit Suisse analysts also said the 5 percent fall in 2018 for the unit was higher than the 3 percent to 4 percent decline that analysts had expected. Pearson has cut thousands of jobs and sold assets, including the Financial Times and the Economist, to fund a move into ebooks, rental schemes and online courses. It has also expanded into providing online academic programs and supporting virtual schools used by home-schooled pupils or those who want to learn subjects not taught at school. “We have made good progress in 2018, returning Pearson to underlying profit growth ... There is much still to do,” Chief Executive Officer John Fallon said. Pearson now expects annual cost savings to be higher than 330 million pounds ($424 million) by the end of 2019. It had previously forecast cutting about 300 million pounds in costs every year between 2017 and 2020. However, the company expects one-off restructuring costs to rise to around 330 million pounds, ahead of its original plan of 300 million pounds. Pearson, founded more than 175 years ago as a small building firm in Yorkshire, northern England, forecast adjusted operating profit of 540 million pounds to 545 million pounds for 2018. This was well above analysts’ average consensus of 536 million pounds, according to compiled consensus. “Pearson’s only managed to hit targets through better than expected cost savings, which are masking weak sales trends in the all-important U.S. market. Unfortunately, there’s no sign this market will turn positive for Pearson this year either,” George Salmon, Equity Analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. Total 2018 underlying revenues were down 1 percent year on year. The company also forecast 2019 adjusted operating profit of 590 million to 640 million pounds against a consensus of 601 million pounds. Shares were down 5.6 percent at 921.6 pence in morning trade."
8.794203313874354," UPDATE 3-U.S./German 2-year bond yield gap widest since 1989 as rate views diverge * US/German two-year yield gap hits 300 bps * Fed rate-hike bets, softer euro zone data push out spread * Peripheral bond yields fall again * Euro zone periphery govt bond yields tmsnrt.rs/2ii2Bqr (Updates prices) By Dhara Ranasinghe LONDON, April 18 (Reuters) - The gap between short-dated U.S. and German borrowing costs reached its widest in almost three decades on Wednesday, reflecting a growing divergence in interest rate outlooks for the U.S. and European central banks. New signs of subdued inflationary pressure in the euro zone bolstered expectations of a cautious stance from the European Central Bank. Portugal’s 10-year bond yield fell to a three-year low. Italian yields hit their lowest level this year. Euro zone inflation rose 1.3 percent in March, compared with the same period last year, down from a previous estimate of 1.4 percent, data showed. On Tuesday, Germany’s ZEW research institute said its index of investor morale fell to its lowest in more than five years in April, pushing bond yields down as investors bet a rate rise from the ECB could come later rather than sooner. Germany’s 10-year bond yield, the benchmark for the bloc, was up 2 basis points on the day at 0.531 percent in late trades . Bonds also got support from UK data, which showed inflation at a one-year low in March, raising some doubts over whether the Bank of England will raise interest rates in May. In contrast, U.S. data this week has reinforced expectations for more rate increases from the Federal Reserve this year. The U.S. two-year Treasury yield rose to 2.431 percent on Wednesday, a new decade high. That pushed the gap over German peers to 300 basis points (bps) - the widest since 1989. “Ninety-nine percent of the spread widening is down to the divergence of central bank polices,” Mizuho rates strategist Antoine Bouvet said. “The market has recently regained optimism that the Fed could tighten policy, driving 2-year U.S. yields higher.” In Europe, 10-year bonds yields fell 0.5 to 4 bps, once again led by southern Europe. Spanish, Italian and Portuguese yields continue to drop amid relatively strong economic conditions, confidence that ECB monetary tightening remains some way off and good news from the region’s banks. Portugal’s 10-year bond yield fell to a three-year low at 1.59 percent. Italian yields hit their lowest since late 2017 at 1.713. The premium that investors pay to hold Italian 10-year bonds over top-rated Germany was at 118.4 basis points, its tightest since February. The ECB meets next week and is not expected to make any major changes. Markets don’t foresee any change in interest rates until mid-2018. “There is a feeling that there is no rush for central banks to either accelerate the removal of stimulus or hasten the pace of tightening, and that is supportive for the likes of the periphery,” Credit Agricole European fixed income strategist Orlando Green said. Germany sold about 2.5 billion euros of 10-year bonds."
