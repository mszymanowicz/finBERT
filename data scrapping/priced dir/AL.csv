19.633083689161925," Alaska Airlines to lease 13 new Boeing 737-9 MAX aircraft Nov 23 (Reuters) - Alaska Air Group Inc said on Monday it would lease 13 new Boeing 737-9 MAX planes from aircraft lessor Air Lease Corp, with deliveries of the jets starting from the fourth quarter of 2021 through 2022. The airline’s move to lease new 737 MAX planes comes after the United States last week lifted a 20-month-old flight ban on the aircraft. As part of the lease agreement, Alaska Air said it would sell 10 Airbus A320s to Air Lease. (prn.to/3m3XYxS)"
21.118343264315463," Airbus, Boeing expected to turn to hybrid engine technology for new planes-lessor CHICAGO (Reuters) - Airbus SE AIR.PA and Boeing Co BA.N are expected to turn to hybrid electric technology when they develop the next generation of airplanes because of limits on improving current engines, the head of a major aircraft lessor said on Thursday. Airbus is already working hard on a hybrid solution but Boeing is likely to be more cautious about making a major investment in a new program given its challenges with the return of the 737 MAX and certification of the 777X, Air Lease Corp AL.N Chief Executive Steven Udvar-Hazy said at the Skift Aviation Forum. “I have serious doubts that either Boeing or Airbus can design an all new airplane using current aerodynamic engine technologies that can have a meaningful - let’s call it double-digit advantage over what we already have,” he said in reference to fuel efficiency. “So what I see evolving is more of a hybrid.” Udvar-Hazy said hybrid engines would allow for a lighter aircraft weight, as well as a technology transition rather than a step change. “Almost like we didn’t go from all piston engine and diesel cars to all electric cars,” he said. “There’s that transition with hybrids that have a smaller gasoline engine and then an electric augmentation engine, like the Prius for the example.” Airbus said last year it was considering producing a hybrid plane by 2035 as it strives for a low-emission aircraft, while Rolls-Royce Holdings PLC RR.L said in March it expected hybrid planes carrying around 100 people to be flying commercially by 2029. Boeing did not respond immediately to a request for comment. Boeing’s director of environmental strategy Sean Newsum said in January that scaling up hybrid technology to a 737-sized plane could take decades, though hybrid-powered regional planes could enter service in the 2030s, according to a FlightGlobal report."
29.197109776536244," European tariffs on Boeing planes threaten their deployment in Europe - lessor (Reuters) - The European Union's decision to impose tariffs of 15% on Boeing Co BA.N planes is a threat to the deployment of the manufacturer's jets in Europe, the chief executive of aircraft lessor Air Lease Corp AL.N said on Monday. “This reciprocal tariff imposed by the EU on the importation of Boeing aircraft is a threat to MAX deployment into Europe, a key MAX and 787 marketplace,” Air Lease CEO John Plueger told investors on his company’s third-quarter earnings call. The EU said earlier on Monday it would impose tariffs on up to $4 billion (£3 billion) of U.S. imports in retaliation for U.S. subsidies for Boeing, though it added it was hopeful of an improvement in trade ties under U.S. President-elect Joe Biden. The EU tariffs come about a week before regulators are expected to clear the Boeing 737 MAX for service after a safety grounding of more than 19 months. Plueger said his company had up to five planes due to be delivered to Europe by the end of 2021, though the schedule was subject to change. “While our leases specifically say that such tariffs are the responsibility of the lessee, it is vital that the leadership at Boeing and Airbus talk with their governments to work out a solution that is in the broader interest of each country and eliminates tariffs on a severely damaged airline industry fighting for recovery,” he said. “We are hopeful and optimistic that a solution eliminating tariffs on both sides of the Atlantic will be found,” Plueger added."
22.896976819666627," Air Lease cuts jet capex, offers relief to crisis-hit airlines PARIS (Reuters) - Air Lease Corp AL.N said it would reduce capital expenditure on new jets in a move likely to restrict its near-term growth but support liquidity, as it faces demands from airlines for rental relief seen as crucial to their survival. The California-based leasing company said it was working with both Airbus AIR.PA and Boeing BA.N to adjust delivery schedules in the wake of production slowdowns. ALC has received requests for help from nearly all airline customers and has so far agreed with almost half of them to defer a total of some $125 million in rentals. Chief Executive John Plueger told analysts he expected to see more airline insolvencies and further consolidation after the coronavirus pandemic halted most air travel, but that long-term fundamentals of air travel remained strong. The industry has been hit hard by the crisis which aggravates disruption from the grounding of Boeing’s 737 MAX in March 2019. At the same time, manufacturers are struggling to build and deliver planes because of the impact on supply chains. ALC, which had already cut 2020 capital spending plans from $6 billion to $4 billion as a result of the MAX grounding, said it had lowered them again to $2.5 billion for the rest of the year due to the epidemic and supply-chain problems. It also plans to slow sales of previously leased-out jets. “The reduction in capex is 98% because of delays” from the manufacturers, Executive Chairman Steven Udvar-Hazy said. Airbus has delivery delays of between four months and more than 12 months of A321neos, while Boeing is likely to delay delivery of some 787s from late this year into 2021, Hazy said. Deliveries are also delayed by problems in getting permission for airline inspection teams to visit factories. Plueger said he would not be surprised to see further softening in planned single-aisle output rates, especially at Airbus which recently lowered its target to 40 a month from 60. ALC is also talking to Boeing about deferring or cancelling some Boeing 737 MAX jets on a case-by-case basis now that several are over a year late, triggering get-out clauses. Hazy said ALC continued to believe in the model, however. Leasing companies including ALC are pinning their hopes on a rise in demand for leased aircraft from airlines whose balance sheets have become too frail to buy aircraft directly, while the number of leasing firms is expected to shrink due to the crisis. A shake-out of the leasing sector is “inevitable”, Plueger said. ALC earlier posted 4.9% lower first-quarter diluted earnings per share of $1.17 as revenues rose 9.7% to $511 million."
-56.89066299118165," Major 737 MAX buyer Air Lease remains confident in demand for jet DUBLIN (Reuters) - Aircraft lessor Air Lease Corp AL.N, which has ordered 150 of Boeing's BA.N grounded 737 MAX, remains confident in the jet's long-term value, Chief Financial Officer Greg Willis said on Wednesday after Boeing announced a new delay to its return. “We are watching the situation, which is still very much evolving, but as we look out there are 7,000 737s that need to be replaced,” Willis told the Airline Economic aircraft finance conference in Dublin. “There may be some short-term volatility in the value of the aircraft, the 737, but I think over the long run there are some very powerful macro elements that are going to drive demand for all airplane types,” he said."
-44.23142795989144," Boeing may have to lower 787 Dreamliner production rate: Air Lease CEO (Reuters) - Boeing Co BA.N could be forced to cut production of its bigger 787 Dreamliners to 10 aircraft per month, amid a drought of orders from China, U.S. airplane leasing firm Air Lease Corp AL.N Chief Executive Officer John Plueger said on Thursday. Boeing, which has been hurt by the grounding of its single-aisle 737 MAX planes, said last year it expects to lower the production of its 787 Dreamliners in late 2020 to 12 aircraft per month, from 14 currently, following some order cancellations and weak demand. China, a major buyer of the 787, hasn’t been buying airplanes from Boeing recently, and “it’s hard to see the rate of 12 being sustainable” beyond 2020 without China in the marketplace, Plueger said at a Bank of America conference. Plueger said Boeing’s momentum to develop a new mid-size airplane (NMA) “has diminished significantly” due to the prolonged 737 MAX crisis. The Boeing NMA is a direct competitor to Airbus A321XLR, its longest-range narrow-body jetliner. “Until (the 737 MAX) is fixed and flying, forget about everything else,” Plueger said."

11.24659964638358," Air Lease says Boeing signaling 'full speed ahead' for midsized jet (Reuters) - Boeing Co is indicating “full speed ahead” for a new midsized airplane in what would be the first all-new jet program for the world’s biggest planemaker in more than a decade, Air Lease Corp’s chief executive, John Plueger, said on Wednesday. Boeing reiterated on Wednesday that it will make a decision in 2020 on whether to launch the plane, which aims to address the middle of the jet market between traditional narrowbody jets with one aisle and long-distance widebody planes. It can start seeking offers in 2019, subject to launch. “Boeing is signaling full speed ahead but there’s still a lot to be decided in these programs,” Plueger said at a conference, noting the company had met with Boeing in Seattle on Friday. In an emailed statement, Boeing said it is still working through the business case for the new jet, adding: “If we decide to offer the airplane and the market responds positively, we will proceed with a launch decision sometime in 2020.” Air Lease, one of the largest aircraft lessors, said it sees interest in Boeing’s proposed mid-market aircraft from airlines, some of which are looking for longer range while others, such as Asian carriers, seek the lowest possible cost per seat kilometer. Still, Boeing is taking a “thoughtful approach” to the potential project following a series of cost overruns and delays with its last jet program, the 787, and has yet to discuss possible pricing, Air Lease Executive Chairman Steven Udvar-Hazy said. Air Lease will meet on Saturday with Airbus SE, which is preparing to counter the potential new jet by Boeing with a new version of its A321 and the larger A330neo. While Boeing and Airbus have traditionally launched new jets alongside purchase commitments from airlines, interest by aircraft lessors like Air Lease is forming an increasingly important role in the decision-making process, industry sources have said. Delta Air Lines Chief Executive Ed Bastian said on Monday that it is interested in a mid-market aircraft from Boeing to replace 200 757 and 767 aircraft over the next decade. Last month, Rolls-Royce dropped out of the race to power Boeing’s planned jet, strengthening a leading position in the high-profile contest for a transatlantic venture involving General Electric Co and France’s Safran. “Somebody had to drop out and the competition at this point is progressing normally,” Plueger said. Pratt & Whitney is also a potential supplier for the new Boeing jet."
-0.9422994975778862," Air Lease, Boeing strike $9.6 billion deal for 737s and 787s FARNBOROUGH, England (Reuters) - U.S. airplane leasing firm Air Lease Corp announced on Tuesday a commitment to order as many as 78 Boeing Co BA.N single-aisle and wide-body airplanes in a deal valued at $9.6 billion at list prices. Air Lease told a press briefing at the Farnborough Airshow that three 787-9s and the first 20 737 MAX airplanes in the total deal were firm purchases, while the remaining 55 737 MAX airplanes were provisional commitments. Air Lease said it had flexibility for taking 737 MAX 8 and 9 variants and expected to take delivery between 2020 and 2024, though most of the jetliners would likely be delivered during the latter portion of that time frame. Separately, Air Lease Chief Executive John Plueger said he was convinced, based on conversations with numerous airlines, there was strong interest and a need for a new mid-market jet Boeing is considering. “There’s definitely strong interest in the entire global airline marketplace in this aircraft,” Plueger said. “The business case is up to Boeing, to be able to get there.” Steve Udvar-Házy, executive chairman of Air Lease’s board, said later that choosing an engine for the mid-market jet would be one of the toughest choices Boeing has to make, adding it would be “nice” to have a choice between two engines."
