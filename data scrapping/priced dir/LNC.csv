-2.064271570522538," Insurer Lincoln National could see upside: Barron's NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. insurer Lincoln National Corp could deliver shareholder returns of 20 percent or more in the coming year, as the market for the company’s main product, variable annuities, recovers, Barron’s reported. Demand for variable annuities, a form of insurance giving policyholders a steady income stream, may bounce back as stock market volatility returns, the financial publication reported. Variable annuities, which make up about 45 percent of Lincoln’s earnings, can offer protection against stock market gyrations. Sales of variable annuities fell by about 41 percent to $91 billion last year from 2011, Barron’s reported. But, Lincoln’s shareholders nearly doubled their money over the past five years, beating the stock market at large. Lincoln’s stock still remains cheap compared to the rest of the market, Barron’s said. The biggest player in variable annuities is Jackson National, part of Prudential Plc. After nonprofit TIAA, Lincoln is the third largest in variable annuity sales, according to the publication. The company has been selling more variable annuities for the past three quarters, according to Barron’s, and Lincoln is anticipated to gain market share as the industry lifts. Lincoln has seen its earnings rise recently because it lowered its costs and the rising stock market increased fees on the assets it manages, the publication said."

-8.830060417583455," Barron's: Delta, Goodyear stock have more upside than prices suggest (Reuters) - Delta Air Lines, Goodyear Tire & Rubber and Lincoln National Corp may have more upside than their discounted share prices suggest, Barron’s reported. The newspaper reviewed stocks trading at no more than about half the valuation of the Standard & Poor’s 500 index - which recently approached 17 times forward earning estimates - and spotlighted those not facing “obvious threats of structural decline” or “hitting cyclical peaks.” Delta DAL.N, which closed at $55.40 per share on Friday, is at 8.6 times earnings, a valuation Morgan Stanley analyst Rajeev Lalwani called ""just too low,"" according to Barron's. Lalwani’s price target of $72 implies a 30 percent upside for Delta, which faces less competition in key markets than some of its peers, the paper reported. Goodyear, GT.O, trading at $27.01, 7.3 times earnings, is benefiting from car makers' shift toward trucks, for which tires are more profitable, and its earnings per share (EPS) is expected to rise at mid-teen percentages the next two years, the paper noted. Lincoln, LNC.N, whose earnings depend heavily on annuities models that have seen decline in recent years, closed Friday at $71.58. But its EPS is expected to rise 8 to 11 percent this year and each of the following two years, thanks in part to a strong stock market that has increased management fees, and an increased demand for savings products, Barron’s reported."
