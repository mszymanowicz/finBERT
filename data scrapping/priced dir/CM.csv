20.81883198850614," UPDATE 1-CIBC scraps Caribbean sale as Canadian banks face hurdles selling overseas assets (Recasts with divestment challenges across the banking sector; adds investor, analyst comments) Feb 3 (Reuters) - Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) became the latest Canadian bank to face hurdles in exiting disappointing acquisitions, joining rivals still holding overseas assets they have sought to sell even as they look to deploy record levels of capital. Canada’s fifth-largest lender said on Wednesday it had scrapped the $797 million sale of a 66.7% stake in its FirstCaribbean business to GNB Financial after failing to get regulatory approval. CIBC’s inability to exit challenging Caribbean markets reflects the hurdles Canadian banks have faced in making an M&A strategy work. The problem is especially acute now with the banks sitting on combined excess capital of C$70 billion ($55 billion), due to a pandemic moratorium by regulators on share buy backs and increasing dividends. “There have been many instances where the banks have bought something (overseas) and then had to divest because it didn’t pan out from a strategic standpoint,” said Anthony Visano, managing director of Kingwest & Company, which holds some Canadian banks. CIBC’s challenge “is a pretty good proxy for the broader experience,” he added. Bank of Nova Scotia faced similar regulatory opposition when it tried to divest its operations in Antigua and Guyana in 2019, and still owns the latter. Royal Bank of Canada , which announced the sale of its Eastern Caribbean operations in December 2019, has yet to finalize the deal. reut.rs/36yVZMb CIBC’s failed sale is a negative as the region faces challenges, Barclay’s equity analyst John Aiken said in a research note. While it will likely take several years for FirstCaribbean to return to its peak contribution of 4% to CIBC’s earnings, “in a growth-starved sector, retaining this potential upside is a positive for longer-term shareholders,” National Bank Financial analyst Gabriel Dechaine wrote in a note. CIBC shares rose 1.1% to C$111.53 in morning trading, compared with a 0.1% gain in the Toronto stock benchmark .

20.81883198850614," CIBC's stake sale in FirstCaribbean fails to get regulatory approval Feb 3 (Reuters) - Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) said on Wednesday it will not proceed with the sale of its majority stake in Barbados-based CIBC FirstCaribbean to GNB Financial Group Ltd after the deal did not get local regulatory approval. CIBC had agreed to sell 66.73% of its stake in CIBC FirstCaribbean to GNB Financial for $797 million in November, 2019. The component of CIBC’s business which housed FirstCaribbean contributed less than 3% to CIBC’s revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020. Barclay’s equity analyst John Aiken views the rejected sale as a negative since operations of the bank in the region face difficult challenges, according to a research note seen by Reuters. CIBC is not the first such Canadian bank to face challenges when it comes to divestiture of it Caribbean operations. Scotiabank's sale of its operations in Antigua and Guyana hit a roadblock in 2019 when it failed to get regulatory approval, but the bank managed to sell its Antigua operations in October last year. reut.rs/36yVZMb In December, 2019, Royal Bank of Canada said it had entered into agreements to sell its Eastern Caribbean operations to banks in the region, subject to regulatory approval.

13.209358291490883," CIBC profit beats estimates on lower bad loan provisions (Reuters) - Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) joined its rivals in reporting a better-than-expected profit for the fourth quarter on Thursday, as it set aside less money to cover potential bad loans arising from the COVID-19 pandemic. Bank of Nova Scotia, Bank of Montreal, National Bank of Canada and Royal Bank of Canada all cut their provisions after three straight quarters of adding for credit losses. CIBC set aside $291 million for the provisions in the fourth quarter ended Oct. 31, down 28% from a year earlier. Net income fell 14% to C$1.02 billion ($788.80 million), as weakness at CIBC’s U.S. commercial banking and wealth management businesses offset gains in its capital markets unit. Canada’s big 6 banks have reported strong results from their capital market businesses in the quarter, helped by increased volatility in markets due to the health crisis. CIBC reported an adjusted diluted profit of C$2.79 per share, beating analysts’ average expectation of C$2.52 per share, according to Refinitiv. ($1 = 1.2931 Canadian dollars)"
9.31225610273043," Bank of Montreal, CIBC say employees to continue to work from home until April TORONTO, Nov 25 (Reuters) - Bank of Montreal and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce said employees currently working from home will continue to do so until at least April. Most office-based employees at Canadian banks have not been working from offices since the start of the coronavirus pandemic in March. A resurgence in cases in many parts of the country, including Toronto, has prompted the resumption of lockdowns and tighter safety measures. Canada has reported 342,444 total cases of COVID-19 and 11,618 deaths. Canada’s five biggest banks - Royal Bank of Canada, Toronto-Dominion Bank, Bank of Nova Scotia, BMO and CIBC all have their biggest offices in Toronto. “Given latest health authority guidance, we now expect the majority of our colleagues working off-site today will continue to do so until at least April 2021,” CIBC’s Group Head for People, Culture and Brand Sandy Sharman said in a memo to employees, adding the bank will give staff four weeks notice before any return plan is put into action. BMO said in a statement that it does not “foresee any broad-based changes for employees who are currently working from home any sooner than April 2021, unless a specific business need exists.” Canada’s biggest banks said in July that they most of their employees will continue to work from home until at least year-end.

12.003883758765213," UPDATE 1-Canadian banks return to focus on cost controls, resume paused job cuts (Adds details from conference throughout) TORONTO, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Canada’s biggest banks are returning to a focus on managing expenses, with some resuming job cuts put on hold in response to the coronavirus pandemic and others deferring investments not deemed urgent. Bank of Montreal and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce are resuming job cuts announced early this fiscal year and paused in the spring, their chief executives said at the online Scotiabank Financials Summit on Wednesday. Expenses haven’t “been the focus of investors over the last couple of quarters,” said Darryl White, chief executive of Bank of Montreal. “But that momentum does matter, when you look to the torque on the other side when the sector has a little bit more opportunity to go on offense.” Canada’s biggest banks had a mixed expense picture in the quarter ended July 31, with lower operating and business development costs due to the pandemic offset by higher compensation costs. BMO was halfway through the cuts announced in December when it put them on hold in February, White said. It resumed the restructuring program last month and expects savings at the end of 2020 and into 2021, he said, adding they will keep expenses flat this year and next. CIBC, which announced its restructuring program in February, hit pause at the height of the pandemic, but expects to complete them this quarter, and aims for expense growth of less than 5% in fiscal 2021, Chief Executive Victor Dodig said. Bank of Nova Scotia has room for further cost cuts in its international markets, and the lender and Toronto-Dominion Bank are holding off on investments they do not need immediately, Brian Porter and Bharat Masrani, their respective CEOs, said. TD will look “very seriously” at opportunities that could help grow its presence in the southeast United States, and those that will build assets, Masrani said. Royal Bank of Canada will continue investing in smaller ventures that it can scale up, Chief Executive Dave McKay said, citing challenges with integrating larger acquisitions.

9.342820112784427," TD, CIBC close out better-than-expected quarter for Canadian banks; outlook uncertain TORONTO (Reuters) - Toronto-Dominion Bank TD.TO and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce CM.TO beat analyst expectations for third-quarter profit on Thursday as strong earnings growth in their capital markets businesses helped offset weakness in almost every other unit. The results close out a reporting season that saw all but one of Canada’s six major banks beat expectations, as conservative provisions in the prior quarter and a jump in trading revenues helped limit the hit from the coronavirus pandemic. Even so, the banks warned of an uncertain environment ahead as government assistance and loan deferral programs wind down in the fourth quarter. While they anticipate an increase in delinquencies as a result, the lenders said the allowances they have built up should cover an increase in bad loans, as long as current economic assumptions hold. Shares of TD, Canada’s second-largest lender, rose 0.9% to C$66.97 in Toronto, while CIBC shares climbed 2.15% to C$104.20, both on track for their highest close since early March. The Canadian banks index .GSPTXBA is up 4.3% since Monday's close, compared with a 1% gain in the Toronto stock benchmark .GSPTSE. TD’s provisions for credit losses (PCL) more than tripled to C$2.2 billion from a year earlier, although they were down from C$3.2 billion in the previous quarter. “Over the last two quarters, we’ve added significantly to allowances for performing loans,” TD Chief Financial Officer Riaz Ahmed said in an interview. “Our expectation is that the economic recovery will be a little bit uneven across regions and different businesses and we expect the recovery to be prolonged.” CIBC’s PCL jumped 80% to C$525 million from a year earlier, although they were down from C$1.4 billion in the previous quarter. That was better than estimates of C$715.7 million. The bank continues to see growth in deposits and loan growth, although that has moderated in some areas, but “going forward, it’s hard to see how things will play out,” CIBC chief financial officer, Hratch Panossian, told Reuters. TD Bank posted an 81% increase in capital markets profit, while CIBC’s rose 67%, in stark contrast to the performance of their Canadian and U.S. personal and commercial banking businesses, which saw earnings slide. Higher loan-loss provisions in these units and lower net interest margins amid decade-low interest rates eroded gains from increased loan and deposit volumes. With pandemic-driven loan deferral programs starting to wind down, CIBC’s Canadian loan balances in deferral accounted for about 11% of the total, from about 14% in the prior quarter. TD said total balances in deferral fell to 6% from 8% in the previous quarter. ($1 = 1.3144 Canadian dollars)"
-9.500225354346695," Canadian lenders TD, CIBC hurt by weaker capital markets TORONTO (Reuters) - Toronto-Dominion Bank and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, two of Canada’s biggest lenders, reported first-quarter earnings on Thursday that fell short of analysts’ forecasts, hurt by weakness in their capital markets businesses. Shares in TD, which have climbed 14 percent in the year to date, slipped 2.9 percent in early trading. Shares in CIBC, which are up 13 percent so far this year, were down 1 percent. Profit at TD, Canada’s second-biggest lender, was hurt by losses at its wholesale banking division while CIBC, the country’s fifth-biggest lender, saw earnings decline in personal and small-business banking as well as capital markets. Global stock markets declined during the period amid geopolitical concerns including escalating trade tensions between the U.S. and China and Britain’s impending exit from the European Union. TD earned, excluding special items, C$1.57 per share, up from C$1.56 a year earlier, but lower than the C$1.72 expected by analysts according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Net income, excluding special items, was C$2.95 billion ($2.24 billion), in the quarter through Jan. 31, unchanged from a year ago. TD reported a net loss of C$17 million at its wholesale banking division, compared to net earnings of C$278 million in the same quarter a year earlier, which it said reflected lower trading revenue and higher costs. The bank warned that, due to challenging market conditions, it anticipates earnings in 2019 will be “closer to the low end” of its 7 percent to 10 percent targeted range. CIBC earned C$3.01 per share in the quarter ended Jan. 31, excluding special items. That was down from C$3.18 a year earlier and short of the C$3.08 forecast by analysts. It was the second quarter in a row that CIBC has missed forecasts, ending a period of four years in which it had beaten or matched estimates. Net income, excluding special items, fell by 5 percent to C$1.36 billion. That included a 4 percent decline in earnings at its personal and small-business banking division to C$463 million, as funds set aside to cover bad loans increased. CIBC said net income at its capital markets division sank 38 percent to C$201 million, due to lower revenue and an increase in funds set aside to cover bad loans. Rivals Royal Bank of Canada, Bank of Nova Scotia and Bank of Montreal also reported declines in earnings from capital markets. ($1 = 1.3161 Canadian dollars)"
-7.833660430161045," CIBC says mortgage sales down less than expected TORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce CM.TO said an anticipated drop in its mortgage sales had not been as bad as it had feared after reporting third-quarter results that beat market expectations. Canada’s fifth-biggest lender forecast in May that new mortgage sales would fall by 50 percent in the second half of the year due to stricter lending rules introduced by the country’s banking regulator. “Three months later we are now seeing some positive signs that suggest better growth in our portfolio than we had seen over the past six months,” the bank’s Canadian retail banking head, Christina Kramer, told analysts on a conference call. Kramer said sales of new mortgages were up C$2 billion ($1.5 billion) compared with the previous quarter but still down year-on-year. “We see it as positive in terms of the outlook for the market,” she said. In an interview, CIBC Chief Financial Officer Kevin Glass said new mortgages sales dropped by more than 40 percent in the quarter compared with a year ago. Canada introduced new rules at the start of the year that require borrowers to be tested on their ability to pay back loans at an interest rate 200 basis points higher than the actual rate on their mortgages. CIBC has seen the biggest impact of any Canadian bank from the changes and is the most exposed to the market, with residential mortgages making up a higher proportion of its loan book than for rivals. The bank had ramped up its market share aggressively before pulling back over the past year. Kramer said CIBC’s pace of sales growth was slowing to match that of rivals, in line with past guidance. CIBC has looked to reduce its reliance on its domestic market by expanding in the United States, where it acquired Chicago-based PrivateBancorp for $5 billion in June last year. The benefits of that strategy began to come through in the latest quarter, with a 295 percent rise in earnings at its U.S. business. That helped the bank lift total net income, excluding one-off items, by 20 percent to C$1.4 billion. Earnings per share, excluding one-off items, rose to C$3.08, ahead of the average analyst forecast of C$2.93, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. CIBC shares were up 0.8 percent at 10:40 a.m. ET (1440 GMT), having earlier risen 1.1 percent to C$123.26, hitting their highest level since January."
9.113146451502027," Cyber crooks claim to hit two big Canadian banks TORONTO (Reuters) - Bank of Montreal BMO.TO and Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce CM.TO said on Monday that cyber attackers may have stolen the data of nearly 90,000 customers in what appeared to be the first significant assault on financial institutions in the country. Bank of Montreal BMO.TO, Canada's fourth biggest lender, said on Monday it was contacted by fraudsters on Sunday who claimed they were in possession of the personal and financial information of a limited number of the bank's customers. A spokesman for the bank said it believed that less than 50,000 of the bank’s 8 million customers across Canada were hacked. He declined to say if any customers lost money as a result of the attack. The fraudsters had threatened to make the data public, the spokesman said, adding that the bank was working with the authorities and conducting a thorough investigation. Bank of Montreal said it believed the attack originated from outside the country and was confident the exposures that led to the theft of customer data had been closed off. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce CM.TO, Canada's fifth biggest lender, said fraudsters contacted the lender on Sunday claiming they had electronically stolen personal and account information of 40,000 customers of its Simplii direct banking brand. CIBC said it has not yet confirmed the cyber breach but is taking the claim seriously. CIBC said customers at its main banking division were not affected. Both banks said they were contacting customers and advising them to monitor their accounts and report any suspicious activity. Other Canadian banks said they had not been affected. Shares in BMO were down 0.3 percent and CIBC was off 0.3 percent. Canada’s six biggest banks have been collaborating along with the Bank of Canada to enhance their defenses against cyber attacks. The Bank of Canada said earlier this month that some attacks would inevitably succeed but it has recovery mechanisms in place to limit the damage. Cyber attacks are increasingly common. Last year, credit monitoring firm Equifax said information on about 146.6 million names, 146.6 million dates of birth, 145.5 million U.S. social security numbers, 99 million addresses and 209,000 payment card numbers and expiration dates, were stolen in a cyber attack."
