Hydro One proposed to buy Avista for C$6.7 billion ($5.02 billion) in 2017 to help expand into the U.S. Northwest. However, the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission rejected the deal in December, saying it would not adequately protect Avista or its customers from political and financial risk. The Ontario provincial government owns about 47 percent of Hydro One. And in January, the Idaho Public Utilities Commission rejected the deal. A petition to reconsider the decision was also denied by the Washington state regulator in early January. Hydro One said on Wednesday it would pay Avista $103 million in termination fees. Shares of Avista were down 1.3 percent at $40.52 in extended trading."

Last week, the regulator struck down Hydro One’s proposed acquisition of its U.S. peer, saying it would not adequately protect Avista or its customers from political and financial risks. Under Washington law, the UTC has 20 days from the date of filing to act on the petition, failing which the petition is deemed to be denied, the companies said in a statement.

-9.518047043630602," State regulator rejects Avista's sale to Canada's Hydro One (Reuters) - A Washington state regulator on Wednesday rejected Canadian electric utility Hydro One Ltd's H.TO proposed acquisition of rival Avista Corp AVA.N, saying the deal would not adequately protect Avista or its customers from political and financial risk. Hydro One proposed to buy Avista for C$6.7 billion ($5.02 billion) in 2017 as it sought to expand into the U.S. Northwest. ""The proposed transaction cannot be said to be consistent with the public interest when it is evident that decisions affecting Hydro One's and Avista's business operations and financial integrity are subject to political considerations,"" the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission said here. Hydro One and Avista acknowledged the decision in a joint statement. “The companies are extremely disappointed in the UTC’s decision, are reviewing the order in detail and will determine the appropriate next steps,” they said. The Ontario provincial government owns 47 percent of Hydro One, and the regulator said that Hydro One had described the province as a passive investor. But after the Ontario provincial election in June, the province and Hydro One announced an agreement that led to the replacement of the company’s board and the retirement of its chief executive officer, the regulator said. The commission said those changes put the government’s political interests above those of other stakeholders, including investors that owned 53 percent of Hydro One. “Provincial government interference in Hydro One’s affairs, the risk of which has been shown by events to be significant, could result in direct or indirect harm to Avista if it were acquired by Hydro One,” the commission said.

-9.631014435413814," Washington regulators reject Avista's sale to Canada's Hydro One Dec 5 (Reuters) - Washington regulators on Wednesday rejected Canadian electric utility Hydro One Ltd’s proposed acquisition of rival Avista Corp, saying the deal does not serve the public interest. Hydro One had proposed to buy Avista for C$6.7 billion ($5.02 billion) in 2017 as it sought to expand into the U.S. Northwest. ""The proposed transaction cannot be said to be consistent with the public interest when it is evident that decisions affecting Hydro One's and Avista's business operations and financial integrity are subject to political considerations,"" the Washington Utilities and Transportation Commission said here. The Ontario government owns 47 percent of Hydro One. According to the commission, post the June 2018 general election in the Province of Ontario, the province and Hydro One announced an agreement that led to the replacement of the company’s board and the retirement of its chief executive officer. Upon investigation, the commission said it found that the resignation of the board and the CEO elevated the government’s political interests than that of the stakeholders, including investors that owned stakes in Hydro One. The deal would not benefit customers of Spokane, Washington-based Avista and would not meet the net-benefit standard required by state law, the commission said. “Provincial government interference in Hydro One’s affairs, the risk of which has been shown by events to be significant, could result in direct or indirect harm to Avista if it were acquired by Hydro One,” the commission said.
