7.551487414187645," Nokia warns of ""challenging"" year as it plays catch-up HELSINKI (Reuters) - Finnish telecom network equipment maker Nokia warned of challenges to come this year as it tries to catch up with rivals after a strong finish to 2020. While both Nokia and rival Ericsson have been gaining 5G customers that might otherwise have gone to China’s Huawei, Ericsson has fared better, winning also big 5G contracts in China, where the deployment of the next-generation network is in full swing. “We have not yet made a breakthrough in 5G (in China) but of course we are not excluding that possibility going forward,” new Chief Executive Pekka Lundmark told Reuters. “But we want to be prudent so that we do not want to be there at any cost.” Lundmark reported better than expected fourth-quarter revenue and underlying profit on Thursday but Nokia forecast 2021 revenue to fall to between 20.6-21.8 billion euros ($25-26 billion) from 21.9 billion euros in 2020. “We expect 2021 to be challenging, a year of transition, with meaningful headwinds due to market share loss and price erosion in North America,” Lundmark said. Nokia said it had lost a part of the Verizon 5G contract in the United States to Samsung Electronics. Lundmark announced a new strategy here in October, under which the company will have four business groups and said Nokia would ""do whatever it takes"" to take the lead in 5G, as it banks on also capturing share from Huawei. “We believe that we have year-to-date captured about half of the geopolitically influenced opportunities that are there,” Lundmark said. “Most of these cases have been in Europe.” Nokia said a growth in its 5G equipment sales in the quarter was partially offset by decreases in its legacy radio access products. Revenue at its mainstay networks business fell 7% to 5.04 billion euros ($6.05 billion). Revenue overall fell 5% to 6.57 billion euros during the quarter, but beat a consensus figure of 6.42 billion euros, Refinitiv Eikon data showed. Quarterly underlying earnings fell to 0.14 euros per share from 0.15 euros a year ago, beating the 0.11 euros consensus. There was also a boost of about 250 million euros one-time items and net sales of 150 million in the quarter that it had expected in 2021. Nokia shares, which were down 1.9% in morning trade, have seen wild swings over the last two weeks as the stock has been targeted by the retail trading frenzy, alongside GameStop Corp and other tech companies. “We maintain our view that Nokia continues to lag Ericsson in technology and is unlikely to catch up before 2022,” Liberum analyst Janardan Menon said.

2.5773195876288684," Telecom Italia to retain Nokia as supplier, curbing Huawei's share of 5G radio network - sources MILAN (Reuters) - Telecom Italia has decided to retain Nokia as a supplier and reduce Huawei’s share of a planned purchase of equipment for building a 5G network, three sources close to the matter told Reuters, amid pressure to exclude the Chinese firm on security concerns. The United States has lobbied Italy and other European allies to avoid using Huawei’s equipment alleging it could pose a security risk - a charge Huawei has rejected. Italy has so far declined to ban Huawei outright. Former national phone company Telecom Italia (TIM) at the beginning of this year was considering dividing a supply contract for the radio access network (RAN) part of its 5G build-out between Huawei and Sweden’s Ericsson, sources told Reuters. The RAN infrastructure includes the base stations and antennas that connect smartphones to the mobile network, and accounts for the bulk of the cost of a new network. Finland’s Nokia - which has previously been among TIM’s mobile radio access network equipment suppliers - was set to miss out on the 5G RAN order, according to the sources. But the agreement has since been reviewed. “Ericsson will provide the bulk of the equipment, while Huawei and Nokia will get a 20-25% each”, one of the sources said on Wednesday. “The negotiations are still going on about issues including the percentage of reduction,” another source said. Huawei, TIM, Nokia and Ericsson all declined to comment. The initial agreement which would have seen Nokia dropped was never publicly disclosed. Even in countries where there is no ban on Chinese companies, telecom operators are wary of selecting Huawei and government and industry sources said Rome has de facto adopted a pro-U.S. line when it scrutinises 5G deals and urges companies to diversify their 5G suppliers. In July, TIM left Huawei out of an invitation to tender for a contract to supply 5G equipment for its core network, where sensitive data are processed."
5.418719211822676," Samsung works its way into European 5G race to fill Huawei gap MADRID/STOCKHOLM/PARIS (Reuters) - European mobile operators are starting to consider Samsung Electronics, long seen as a non-starter, in the race to replace China’s Huawei as the supplier of their fledgling 5G systems, although early talks suggest it will still be an uphill struggle. After Samsung unexpectedly landed a $6 billion deal with U.S. giant Verizon in September, Spain’s Telefonica and France’s Orange have both held talks with the South Korean firm, company executives say. Huawei’s hardware makes up nearly half of the European 4G network that will form the foundation for super-fast 5G, alongside that of Nokia and Ericsson. But European operators are under pressure from the United States to shun the Chinese giant for 5G systems that could in future be supporting services ranging from telemedicine to factory automation. Washington says there is a risk Huawei could spy for Beijing, though the firm has repeatedly denied this. One problem for Samsung is that operators worry that its products will not be compatible with the existing 4G networks built by Huawei, and that it will cost hundreds of millions to rip these out and replace them rather than simply upgrade them. “They need to be extremely competitive,” said Telefonica Chief Technology Officer Enrique Blanco. “The cost of swapping the 4G is an extra cost for Samsung so, even if you are inviting them, it is difficult for them to be competitive.” A Samsung spokesman said the idea that its equipment was not compatible with existing infrastructure was a misconception, but did not provide technical details. He declined to specify which European markets it was trying to enter, but said it hoped to replicate inroads it had made in Asia and the Americas. Verizon is using Samsung for various parts of its vast U.S. network. “We had done some trials with them and given them a few markets to see how they would work and, and then it worked well,” Verizon’s Chief Product Development Officer Nicola Palmer told Reuters. Orange Chief Technology and Innovation Officer Michael Trabbia said he, too, was considering Samsung in Europe. The two European countries where Orange has not yet chosen an equipment maker are Poland and Romania. “We can see that Samsung is becoming more and more credible on 4G and 5G,” Trabbia said. But he said Orange had tested both Samsung and Huawei equipment before opting for Nokia and Ericsson for its 5G systems in France. European operators have already spent billions of euros to roll out fibre optic networks in Europe, and 5G will drain their pockets even more. The industry body GSMA expects $1.14 trillion to be invested globally over five years, 78% of it on 5G. If a supplier's products need to be swapped out, it can be pricey. When Bell Canada decided to drop Huawei here this year, analysts estimated the cost of replacing its 4G equipment at about $200 million over several years. Altice Europe’s French telecoms business SFR also says it requires its new 5G equipment to fit the existing structure. A source close to the company said Samsung was “not there yet”, but could be an option in the future. Europe’s biggest mobile operator, Deutsche Telekom, remains sceptical whether Samsung can be competitive in the short term, according to company sources and internal briefing documents. Analysts too say it will need to do more to compete with Nokia and Ericsson on their home turf. “If they get a deal from Deutsche Telekom or Telefonica, they need a big organisation to build and support the infrastructure,” said Kimmo Stenvall, an analyst at OP Markets Helsinki. “They can’t just send their offers to European operators and then start building networks here.” Samsung’s spokesman said it had a strong Networks team and research facilities in Europe. But Stenvall said big deals usually presuppose years of groundwork in forming relationships with operators and testing networks. “We operators cannot be suffering,” said Telefonica’s Blanco. “We need to be maintaining capabilities.”"

Nokia is replacing China’s Huawei, according to a source familiar with the matter. Nokia had in October won contracts from Orange and Proximus to build 5G radio networks in Belgium after they dropped Huawei amid U.S. pressure to exclude the Chinese firm from supplying key telecoms equipment. Ericsson and Nokia have been beneficiaries of the trend by various governments to restrict Chinese companies from taking part in the deployment of 5G due to national security concerns. In Luxembourg Nokia will replace the incumbent spectrum vendor in the deal, with deployment expected to start next year. It did not name the incumbent. Proximus Luxembourg has spectrum in the 700Mhz band for low-latency communication and the 3.5Ghz band for dense urban coverage."

Other senior managers who have left the company recently include Chief Marketing Officer Barry French and Chief Technology Officer and President of Bells Labs Marcus Weldon. In May, Nokia’s enterprise chief Kathrin Buvac left the company to lead business development at Amazon Web Services, and in June, Nokia nominated Marco Wiren as its new chief financial officer to replace long-serving Kristian Pullola, who will leave the company at the end of this year. “There is some evolution within the senior team and these changes are being worked through at an individual level with a lot of mutual goodwill and respect,” the spokeswoman said."
-5.084745762711863," German court refers Nokia-Daimler connected car clash to European Court DUESSELDORF/BERLIN (Reuters) - A German court on Thursday referred a patent licensing dispute between Finnish telecoms equipment maker Nokia and German carmaker Daimler to the European Court of Justice to clarify the law as it applies to supply chains. The Duesseldorf Regional Court said it would suspend proceedings in Nokia’s fight against Daimler over royalties for technology used in navigation systems, vehicle communications and self-driving cars. The long-running row revolves around standard technologies used in 4G mobile networks that provide information to vehicles known as connected cars, and whether Nokia is licensing them on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms. The dispute has raised concern in Brussels, where the European Commission has proposed a mechanism to establish whether certain patents are essential to a technology standard and to reduce arguments over their use. “It’s a welcome development that the European courts will pronounce on these very tricky questions,” Commission Vice-President Margrete Vestager said in Brussels. “As you know we have tricky cases exactly in this area.” Thursday’s referral to Luxembourg effectively freezes the status quo in which Daimler uses Nokia’s patents for free - a blow to the Finnish firm that earns 1.4 billion euros ($1.7 billion) a year from licences. The judgment can be appealed. “Daimler has been using Nokia’s technology for 14 years and has looked for every avenue to avoid payment. In light of today’s decision, we will now consider our options,” Nokia said in a statement. The Stuttgart-based carmaker welcomed the Duesseldorf court’s referral, saying it would make it possible to clarify questions on standard essential patents “on a fundamental and Europe-wide level”. Nokia has said that it has discretion to determine the point in the supply chain at which it issues licences, the Duesseldorf court said in a statement following Thursday’s ruling. Daimler has countered that, under European Union single market rules, Nokia is obliged to offer unlimited licences for all uses relating to standard patents. In its ruling, the court found Nokia had the right to seek an injunction against Daimler for patent violation. But it also raised the question over whether doing so would represent an abuse of Nokia’s dominant market position. It suspended proceedings pending clarification of a list of related questions it put to the European Court. The Duesseldorf case is one of several between Nokia and Daimler that are working their way through German courts - a typical feature of patent litigation as parties seek a ruling that can establish a favourable precedent. With the latest decision, Daimler has pulled level with Nokia on two wins each. ($1 = 0.8391 euros)"

4.627249357326482," Exclusive: EU Commission to intervene in tech, carmakers' patent dispute - document BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Commission plans to step into the patent dispute between tech companies and carmakers and may set up a system to check whether some patents are essential to a technology standard as claimed, according to a Commission document. The move by the EU executive comes as Finnish telecom equipment maker Nokia and German automaker Daimler battle in German courts over the level of royalties for key navigation and communications technologies and who should pay them. The proposals are outlined in the Commission’s Intellectual Property Action Plan, seen by Reuters, which European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager and EU digital chief Thierry Breton will present on Nov. 24. As a first step, the Commission will engage with the automotive sector to explore the possibility of effective licensing solutions, the document said, adding that the industry’s needs are the most acute. While the car industry currently faces the most problems between standard essential patent (SEP) holders and licensees, the issue is also relevant in the digital and electronics sectors and internet-connected devices in energy, health and smart manufacturing, it said. The Commission to date has refrained from the disputes and has urged the companies to resolve the issue themselves, with some seeing it as a contractual issue. Carmakers, however, see it as an antitrust issue, with Daimler lodging a complaint with Vestager. Patents are a lucrative source of revenue for Nokia which makes 1.4 billion euros ($1.7 billion) in licensing revenues annually. It says Daimler has been using its cellular standard-essential patents (SEPs) without authorisation. Daimler however wants Nokia to license its suppliers rather than with the company itself, a move which could cut the level of fees. To further clarify the regulatory framework for declaring, licensing and enforcing SEPs, the Commission will consider regulatory reforms such as setting up an independent system of third-party essentiality checks, the document said. Such vetting would look into whether some patents are essential to a standard as claimed by the patent holders and also counter fears that some royalties are calculated at too high a level due to companies licensing unnecessary patents. Experts, however, say essentiality checks may be difficult to carry out in a global market and that it may be difficult to find a qualified body with the technical competence to do them."
38.53211009174313," Setback for Nokia in German patent battle with Lenovo BERLIN (Reuters) - A German appeals court on Monday lifted the enforcement of an injunction won by Nokia Oyj in a patent dispute with Lenovo Group Ltd to block the world’s largest PC maker from selling its products in Europe’s largest economy. Nokia last month enforced the order issued by a lower court in Munich, which found Lenovo had violated the terms of its patented H.264 video-compression technology that is widely used in smartphones and computers. Lenovo said the appeals court had granted its request to stay enforcement of the Munich ruling “based on the high probability that the decision cannot be expected to be upheld on appeal.” Responding, Nokia said the appeals court’s decision did not signal it would side with Lenovo on the merits of the case: “We are confident that our case will hold on appeal.” Nokia launched its legal battle against Lenovo last year over alleged infringement of 20 patents. The Finnish company has ongoing cases against Lenovo in the United States, Brazil and India, in addition to six in Germany. Such stays are common in German court battles and typically remain in force until a final judgment on the merits of the case. The case revolves around whether license fees for H.264 sought by Nokia from Lenovo are fair and reasonable."
36.119402985074615," Nokia cuts profit forecast and revamps strategy, shares slump 13% STOCKHOLM/HELSINKI (Reuters) - Telecom equipment maker Nokia NOKIA.HE cut its full-year profit and margin forecasts on Thursday, sending its shares tumbling 13% as the Finnish company's new chief executive overhauled its strategy to win the 5G race. Announcing a new strategy under which the company will have four business groups, CEO Pekka Lundmark said Nokia would ""do whatever it takes"" to take the lead in 5G where it lags Swedish rival Ericsson ERICb.ST and Chinese group Huawei[HWT.UL]. Nokia lowered its full-year profit outlook range by 0.02 euros to a midpoint of 0.23 euros per share, having reported third-quarter results broadly in line with analysts’ expectations. “We expect to stabilise our financial performance in 2021 and deliver progressive improvement towards our long-term goal after that,” Lundmark said in a statement. The company also cut its 2020 operating margin forecast to 9% from 9.5% and for 2021 expects operating margin of 7-10%. JP Morgan analysts said higher research and development spending was likely to drive the margins lower than the consensus expectations of 10.9% for 2021. “Nokia is likely to find raising operating margins challenging due to its relatively low market share, Liberum analysts said in a note. Ericsson last week reported quarterly core earnings above market estimates, helped by higher margins and China’s 5G rollout, and said it was “more confident” in meeting its 2020 targets. Unlike Ericsson, Nokia has not won any 5G radio contracts in the highly competitive Chinese market. Nokia and Ericsson have been gaining more customers in Europe as more telecom operators start rolling out 5G networks and China’s Huawei is increasingly shunned by several governments over security concerns. Nokia, however, suffered a setback in the third quarter when it lost out to Samsung Electronics 005930.KS on a part of a contract to supply 5G equipment to Verizon VZ.N. “We have lost share at one large North American customer, see some margin pressure in that market, and believe we need to further increase R&D investments to ensure leadership in 5G,” Lundmark said. Its quarterly revenue also fell due to weakness in its services business. Nokia said its July-September underlying earnings were flat year-on-year at 0.05 euros per share, meeting the 0.05 euros consensus in a Refinitiv poll."
0.0," Nokia seeks to block Lenovo sales in Germany over patent licensing STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Nokia on Tuesday sought to enforce an injunction against Lenovo, the world’s biggest PC maker, to block sales of its products in Germany after violation of a video encoding patent. A Munich court ruled on Sept. 30 that Hong Kong-listed Lenovo infringed one of Nokia’s patents, ordered an injunction and a recall of products from retailers, among other things. Nokia launched its legal battle against Lenovo last year over alleged infringement of 20 patents. The Finnish company has ongoing cases against Lenovo in the United States, Brazil and India, in addition to six cases in Germany. Lenovo has appealed against the Munich court ruling. “We believe Nokia has violated its own legal obligations by refusing to license its technology on Fair Reasonable and Non-Discriminatory (FRAND) terms to either Lenovo or our third-party suppliers whose parts include H.264 technology,” a Lenovo statement said. H.264 technology is a video compression format widely used in smartphones and computers. Nokia has previously sued Apple for infringing its patents and received here $2 billion in settlement in 2017. The Munich court, the judgment of which applies only to Germany, rejected Lenovo’s assertion that Nokia had not complied with FRAND obligations. Nokia said that Lenovo has been unwilling to enter discussions, and can resolve the matter by accepting its responsibilities and agreeing a licence on fair terms. “Nokia is demanding a highly-inflated global royalty rate that is more than 50 times what Lenovo believes is reasonable and appropriate,” a source at Lenovo said.

-1.1961722488038236," Got any signal up here? Nokia to build mobile network on the moon HELSINKI (Reuters) - Struggling to get a phone signal at home on planet Earth? Perhaps you’ll have better luck on the moon. Nokia has been selected by NASA to build the first cellular network on the moon, the Finnish company said on Monday, as the U.S. space agency plans for a future where humans return there and establish lunar settlements. NASA aims to return humans to the moon by 2024 and dig in for a long-term presence there under its Artemis programme. Nokia said the first wireless broadband communications system in space would be built on the lunar surface in late 2022, before humans make it back there. It will partner with a Texas-based private space craft design company, Intuitive Machines, to deliver the equipment to the moon on their lunar lander. The network will configure itself and establish a 4G/LTE communications system on the moon, Nokia said, though the aim would be to eventually switch to 5G The network will give astronauts voice and video communications capabilities, and allow telemetry and biometric data exchange, as well as the deployment and remote control of lunar rovers and other robotic devices, according to the company. The network will be designed to withstand the extreme conditions of the launch and lunar landing, and to operate in space. It will have to be sent to the moon in an extremely compact form to meet the stringent size, weight and power constraints of space payloads. Nokia said the network would be using 4G/LTE, in use worldwide for the last decade, instead of the latest 5G technology, because the former was a more known quantity with proven reliability. The company would also “pursue space applications of LTE’s successor technology, 5G”."
0.990099009900991," Nokia's COVID detection system automatically scans for temperature, mask STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Nokia has created an automated system that uses a thermal camera and real-time video analytics to determine if a person has COVID-19 symptoms and is wearing a mask, part of efforts to protect employees as they return to work. The Finnish company has been using the system in its factory in Chennai, India, for two months and has screened more than 200,000 people in that facility. The factory, which was closed for some time to comply with Indian regulations following the coronavirus outbreak, has more than 1,000 employees. The system detects whether a person has a high temperature or is not wearing their face-mask and alerts the operation centre, the head of Analytics and IoT for Nokia, Amit Shah, told Reuters. It comes with its privacy settings where faces can be blurred to comply with local regulations and deployed across different locations and monitored from a central facility without the need to keep a person at every check point. “Nokia factories and R&D centres are deploying this,” Shah said, adding that talks were also at “pretty advanced stages” on deploying the system in North America, Latin America and Asia and across sectors including schools and government buildings. Nokia said customers could expand the product to add other features, including predictive surveillance, machine maintenance and security threats."

The moves are among the first by commercial operators in Europe to drop Huawei from next-generation networks and come after months of diplomatic pressure from Washington, which alleges Huawei equipment could be used by Beijing for spying. Belgian capital Brussels is home to the European Union’s executive body and parliament, making it a matter of particular concern for U.S. intelligence agencies. Huawei, the world’s biggest telecoms equipment supplier, strongly denies the U.S. allegations. The news – revealed by Reuters and confirmed by Orange Belgium and Proximus the next day – sent Nokia’s shares up by more than 3% when markets opened Friday.

-2.481389578163774," Huawei ousted from heart of EU as Nokia wins Belgian 5G contracts STOCKHOLM/PARIS (Reuters) - Orange and Proximus have picked Nokia to help build 5G networks in Belgium as they drop Huawei amid U.S. pressure to exclude the Chinese firm from supplying key telecoms equipment. The moves are among the first by commercial operators in Europe to drop Huawei from next-generation networks and come after months of diplomatic pressure from Washington, which alleges Huawei equipment could be used by Beijing for spying. The Belgian capital Brussels is home to the NATO alliance and the European Union’s executive and parliament, making it a matter of particular concern for U.S. intelligence agencies. “Belgium has been 100% reliant on Chinese vendors for its radio networks - and people working at NATO and the EU were making mobile phone calls on these networks,” said John Strand, an independent Danish telecoms consultant. “The operators are sending a signal that it’s important to have access to safe networks.” The United States welcomed the decisions by Orange Belgium and Proximus, which have a network sharing agreement. “This is the latest example of evaporating Huawei deals and further confirmation of this worldwide momentum towards trusted vendors,” said Keith Krach, the U.S. undersecretary at the State Department for economic growth, energy and the environment. Huawei [HWT.UL], the world’s biggest telecoms equipment supplier, strongly denies the U.S. allegations and has been highly critical of calls to ban it from 5G contracts. However, it said on Friday it accepted the decisions by Orange Belgium and Proximus, which confirmed an earlier Reuters exclusive. “This is the outcome of a tender organised by operators and the result of the free market,” a Huawei spokesman said. “We embrace fair competition, the more diversified a supply chain the more competitive it becomes,” he said, adding Huawei had been supplying equipment in Belgium for more than a decade and its commitment remained unchanged. The decisions leave Liberty Group’s Telenet as the only mobile carrier in Belgium yet to say which supplier it will use for its next mobile networks. Telenet currently relies on equipment made by China’s ZTE, and plans to announce its 5G decision in the first half of 2021, a spokeswoman said. The deals to supply radio gear to Orange Belgium and Proximus are a boost for Nokia, which struggled to make headway in the 5G market earlier this year even as Huawei was under pressure. “I have tried to become RAN (radio access network) supplier to Orange Belgium since 2003 when the company was still Mobistar. Here we are, finally,” tweeted Tommi Uitto, president of Nokia Mobile Networks. The companies did not disclose a value for the contracts. Nokia shares were up 3% in afternoon trading. Orange Belgium and Proximus said Ericsson would supply the core of their 5G networks, a smaller slice of business. EU members have been stepping up scrutiny of so-called high-risk vendors. This subjects Huawei’s governance and technology to critical examination and is likely to lead other European operators to strip it from their networks, analysts say. Nokia and Ericsson have been the main beneficiaries of the challenges facing Huawei. From Bell Canada and Telus Corp in Canada to BT in Britain, the Nordic companies have been grabbing market share from the Chinese firm. Separately, Nokia said it had won a contract to provide data management software to Telefonica UK, which said the Finnish firm would replace the less than 1% of Huawei kit in its network."

-2.481389578163774," Exclusive: Orange venture in Belgium to replace Huawei mobile gear with Nokia kit - sources STOCKHOLM/PARIS (Reuters) - Telecoms operators Orange Belgium OBEL.BR and Proximus PROX.BR have decided to progressively replace Huawei-made mobile equipment in Belgium and Luxembourg with Nokia NOKIA.HE gear, two sources close to the matter said. The sources said the operators, which share their mobile network, had faced political pressure to drop Huawei as a supplier following U.S. accusations that Huawei’s gear could be used for spying by Beijing. Orange and Nokia declined to comment. Proximus did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Thursday evening, while Huawei had no immediate comment. The move by Orange and Proximus represents one of the first cases in Europe where commercial operators have dropped Huawei from their next generation mobile Internet, or 5G, networks in response to political pressure. China and Huawei deny the spying allegations. But Belgium’s capital Brussels is home to the European Union’s executive body and parliament, making it a strategic location and a matter of particular concern for U.S. intelligence agencies. “There’s a profound insistence on the need to push Huawei towards the exit,” one of the two sources said. “There’s also a growing concern about Huawei’s capacity to produce its equipment,” the source added, referring to the United States’ decision to cut off Huawei’s access to vital computer chips. Nokia announced late last month it had clinched a deal with Britain's biggest mobile operator BT BT.L to supply 5G radio equipment. Proximus and Orange’s Belgian division signed an agreement last year to share their mobile network, which is why the decision to shift to Nokia was a collective one. Orange Belgium has partnered with Huawei since 2007 for the deployment of its mobile network in Belgium and Luxembourg. Proximus chose the Shenzhen-based company in 2009 for the progressive upgrading of its network. Other European countries are moving towards greater restrictions on Huawei. The German government is planning tougher oversight of telecoms network vendors that will make it harder for Huawei to keep a foothold in Europe’s largest market. France, the EU’s second-largest economy, will de facto ban Huawei’s mobile equipment by 2028, sources close to the matter said in July."

The deal will make Nokia BT’s largest equipment provider and comes just months after Britain said it would ban China’s Huawei Technologies from next-generation 5G telecom networks. The size of the contract was not disclosed. Nokia has won 63% of the BT contract, or about 11,600 radio sites, a source familiar with the matter said. Nokia currently powers BT’s network in Greater London, the Midlands and rural locations, but the new contract will add multiple towns and cities across the United Kingdom. BT Group CEO Philip Jansen said the agreement would allow it to continue the rollout of fixed and mobile networks, with digital connectivity critical to the UK’s economic future. Under the current ban, UK operators will not be able to purchase 5G components from Huawei from the end of this year and must remove all existing Huawei gear from the 5G network by 2027, offering opportunities for for Nokia and Sweden's Ericsson ERICb.ST. Nokia had a 21% share of the global radio access network (RAN) market in 2019, versus 29% for Ericsson and Huawei’s 31%, according to data from Moody’s. While Nokia has been winning contracts from operators across the world, it suffered a setback earlier this month when it lost out to Samsung Electronics 005930.KS on a part of a contract to supply new 5G equipment to Verizon VZ.N. Nokia is under new management with Lundmark taking the top job last month and telecoms veteran Sari Baldauf becoming the chairwoman in May."

-2.200488997555009," Dish signs up Nokia to supply 5G core software STOCKHOLM/HELSINKI (Reuters) - U.S. satellite TV provider Dish Network, racing to build a 5G network in the United States by 2023, has turned to Finland’s Nokia to supply 5G core software. Dish is building its network ground up and has so far chosen non-traditional telecoms vendors and a new technology called Open Radio Access Network (RAN) that uses software to run network functions on the cloud, reducing the use of physical equipment. The agreement with Nokia marks Dish’s first deal with a traditional telecoms equipment supplier. Dish, which is sitting on an unused wireless spectrum portfolio worth $20 billion, is working with Fujitsu, Nvidia, Altiostar and Mavenir to supply various parts of the network. Nokia has distanced itself from other telecoms equipment firms by being a vocal supporter of Open RAN and had earlier partnered with Japan’s Rakuten - the first firm to use an Open RAN-based network - in deploying its 4G network. Dish’s network will have a much larger footprint than Rakuten’s. As part of the deal, Nokia will offer subscriber data management, device management and integration services, among others, the companies said in a joint statement. A core network is where the most critical controls are located and the sensitive information is stored, while the peripheral radio network is typically larger and includes masts, antennas and other passive equipment. After China’s Huawei was banned from U.S. telecom networks, Nokia and Ericsson are dominating the race for 5G deployment in the country, with Samsung slowly catching up."

Pekka Lundmark, the new CEO, took over from Rajeev Suri in August, a month earlier than planned. Under Suri, Nokia last year slashed its profit outlook and halted dividend payouts, after product missteps that hurt its 5G ambitions and knocked more than a fifth off its market value. “We believe the (CEO) exchange alone will have a good effect,” Makinen said. “We have high expectations of Nokia and the new management that the potential we see in it will be realised.” A Nokia spokeswoman declined to comment. Nokia in May also got a new chairwoman in Sari Baldauf, one of the most high-profile female executives in the global telecoms industry. She took over from Risto Siilasmaa who chaired the Finnish firm for eight years. Solidium, which became an investor in Nokia in 2018 after buying a 3.3% stake, now owns more than 5%. Rival Ericsson, which also replaced much of its top management in 2016, has been able to capitalise on the 5G rollout faster. Both firms have also benefited from U.S. moves move to ban China’s Huawei from bidding for telecom contracts. Nokia’s financial potential had not been realised as a merger with Alcatel-Lucent took long time and 5G emerged more quickly than operators and companies expected, Makinen said “We don’t believe it will remain this way in the long run ... Nokia has a good roadmap to catch up,” he added."

With this $6.64 billion contract win, Samsung has reinforced its position as a challenger to the dominance of Nokia and its Nordic rival Ericsson in selling telecom gear, after China’s Huawei was barred from bidding for 5G contracts in the United States. The loss for Nokia comes after its new Chief Executive Pekka Lundmark took the top job in August, but the source said negotiations were going on before he took charge. A Nokia spokeswoman declined to comment on the loss. “We play a critical role in enabling Verizon’s 3G and 4G networks and continue to work with them to accelerate innovation in 5G,” she said. “They remain a top three global customer.” Major telecom firms such as Verizon uses several suppliers for building various parts of a network with radio contracts accounting for a big part of the spending. Liberum analyst Janardan Menon said the contract loss could impact Nokia’s ability to invest in technology at the same rate at its competition, and rival Ericsson might have even increased its share at Verizon. Liberum has a “hold” rating on Nokia shares. An Ericsson spokesman declined to comment. Nokia shares were down 1% in morning trade. The shares had fallen in July when brokerage JPMorgan said there was a real risk Verizon would reduce its dependence on Nokia as its primary RAN (radio access network) supplier going forward and shift towards Samsung."

Solidium became an investor in Nokia in 2018 after buying a 3.3% stake for about 844 million euros (753.48 million pounds), and has been increasing its stake since late last year. Nokia, which axed its dividend after a profit warning last October, has been scripting a turnaround by keeping a lid on costs and addressing shipment delays in its attempt to compete with rivals such as China’s Huawei and Sweden’s Ericsson. Solidium had criticised Nokia earlier this year for poor communication and sent some “feisty feedback” to the company’s management following its profit warning.

-22.593320235756384," Nokia wins second round of legal fight against Daimler on patent fees HELSINKI/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Nokia's NOKIA.HE fight with Daimler DAIGn.DE over patent licensing fees won backing from a German court on Tuesday after the judge said the carmaker had not made a serious attempt to resolve the issue with the Finnish company. The spat highlights a wider battle between tech companies and the car industry over royalties for technologies used in navigation systems, vehicle communications and self-driving cars. The issues are crucial for Nokia, which makes 1.4 billion euros ($1.67 billion) in licensing revenues every year. The Mannheim court in Germany said neither Daimler nor other parties involved in the case were “seriously prepared or ready to conclude a license agreement” with Nokia on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory (FRAND) terms. The same court however ruled against Nokia in the first patent case in February. There are eight more lawsuits pending in the German courts, with the third case scheduled for Sept. 5. Following Tuesday’s judgment, the company can enforce a sales ban against Daimler but this would require it posting a 7-billion-euro bond as a guarantee to cover any damages in the event the ban is overturned on appeal, making such a move unlikely. Daimler said it did not understand how the court could come to this conclusion and that it would appeal. Nokia said the court confirmed it had acted in a fair way in licensing its cellular standard-essential patents (SEPs), and that Daimler was using Nokia technologies without authorisation. “We hope that Daimler will now accept its obligations and take a license on fair terms,” Jenni Lukander, president of Nokia Technologies, said in a statement. Continental CONG.DE, which intervened in the case, criticised the judgment. “It is precisely such a licence agreement that Continental has long been demanding from Nokia and which it is currently requesting in court in the USA from Nokia,” the company said in a statement. The court also rejected a suggestion from the German cartel office that the case should be referred to Europe’s highest court in Luxembourg, saying it did not consider it appropriate.

-29.497907949790797," European stocks suffer monthly decline as growth worries come to fore (Reuters) - European stocks posted their first monthly decline since a market selloff in March on Friday as growing doubts over a global recovery from the coronavirus crisis overshadowed a batch of strong earnings from technology firms. The pan-European STOXX 600 index .STOXX gave up early gains to close 0.9% lower, pressured by a weak open for Wall Street as optimism from stellar earnings reports from big tech names Amazon AMZN.O, Apple AAPL.O and Facebook FB.O faded. An early reading of the euro zone’s economy showed the bloc shrank by a bigger-than-expected 12.1% in the second quarter, its deepest contraction on record as lockdowns ravaged business activity. Spain's benchmark index .IBEX dropped 1.7% as the country posted the worst output slump, while GDP in Italy and France also fell sharply but less than forecast. “Lockdown exits coupled with massive stimulus brought a strong rebound in activity during Q2, which supported the rally in equities, but recovery appears to be levelling off,” equity strategists at Barclays wrote in a note. “Overall, choppy markets could continue due to elevated uncertainty, low conviction and tight summer liquidity.” The STOXX 600 was down about 1% in July, with fears of a resurgence in COVID-19 cases also weighing on the mood as Britain imposed a tougher lockdown in swathes of northern England, while Spain saw a surge in new infections. Technology stocks .SX8P were among the few gainers, up 0.7% after forecast-beating results from Wall Street's tech majors on Thursday. The top gainer on the STOXX 600 was Finnish telecom network equipment maker Nokia NOKIA.HE, up 12.5% after reporting an unexpected rise in underlying profit as it reduced low-margin business. “The strength of numbers from the ‘four horsemen of tech’ is leading to a halo effect for the tech sector and a resumption of growth stocks leading the market,” said Neil Campling, head of TMT research at Mirabaud Securities. “Nokia results also help sentiment as the key for the equipment stocks is always on margins to get a sense of pricing.” BNP Paribas BNPP.PA rose 0.8% as it earned a higher-than-expected quarterly profit, boosted by a surge in fixed income trading and strong demand for corporate finance. Nearly 50% of the companies listed on the STOXX 600 have reported quarterly earnings so far, and 64% of those have surpassed beaten-down profit expectations, according to Refinitiv data."
-29.497907949790797," Nokia shares jump after cull of low-margin business sees earnings beat HELSINKI/STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Finnish telecom network equipment maker Nokia reported an unexpected rise in second-quarter underlying profit on Friday as it took on less low-margin business particularly in China, sending its shares up 13% in early trade. Cutting less-profitable service business and not winning 5G radio deals in the cut-throat Chinese market helped Nokia, where new Chief Executive Pekka Lundmark takes over this weekend, upgrade its earnings outlook for 2020. “We do not mind trading poor revenue which doesn’t have high quality margin for better revenue,” outgoing chief executive Rajeev Suri told Reuters. Nokia said its underlying earnings in April through June rose to 0.06 euros per share from 0.05 euros a year ago, beating the 0.03 euros consensus in a Refinitiv poll. Nokia, which had warned of a weak second quarter due to the virus, raised its forecast for 2020 underlying earnings per share to between 0.20 and 0.30 euros, from 0.18-0.28 euros. Quarterly revenue fell 11% to 5.09 billion euros, below a consensus figure of 5.28 billion, Refinitiv Eikon data showed. Most of the drop was due to the effects on the economy of COVID-19, but Suri also cited a sharp decline in China based on a “prudent approach” in that market, and proactive steps to reduce low-margin services business, though he didn’t say what the latter consisted of. Nokia lowered its outlook for its market share in its main markets, measured by revenue, to underperform from its previous guidance of performing in line with rivals. Suri’s successor Lundmark still faces key decisions on finding a balance between improving profitability and defending Nokia’s market share, which currently makes it number two behind China’s Huawei [HWT.UL] but ahead of Sweden’s Ericsson when measured by revenue. “While the improvement in profitability from extremely low levels is clearly very encouraging, we are unsure on how much further Nokia can take such an improvement when sales are coming under significant pressure,” Liberum analyst Janardan Menon said. Ericsson had reported a rise in 5G network sales and software revenue two weeks ago. Suri steps down after more than a decade in charge of Nokia and Nokia Siemens Networks. The leadership change comes as turbulence prevails in European telecoms markets, with increasing pressure from some governments for operators to exclude or limit the use of 5G equipment from Huawei."

The new technology, dubbed Open Radio Access Network (Open RAN), aims to reduce reliance on any one vendor by making every part of a telecom network interoperable and allowing operators to choose different suppliers for different components. Currently, Nokia along with Ericsson and Huawei supplies most of the equipment for building telecom networks and mobile operators can only pick one for each part of their network As part of the implementation plan, Nokia plans to deploy Open RAN interfaces in its baseband and radio units, a spokesman said. An initial set of Open RAN functionalities will become available this year, while the full suite of interfaces is expected to be available in 2021, the company said. Nokia, unlike other vendors, had been promising to participate in the development of open RAN technology and have joined several industry alliances."

-8.083140877598154," Nokia to cut a third of jobs at French arm Alcatel-Lucent PARIS (Reuters) - Finnish telecoms equipment maker Nokia Oyj NOKIA.HE plans to cut 1,233 jobs at its French subsidiary Alcatel-Lucent International, equivalent to a third of the unit's workforce, the group said on Monday, confirming an earlier Reuters report. The announcement, just as Europe prepares for the deployment of the next generation of mobile internet, or 5G, has political resonance in France because Nokia bought the unit five years ago on condition it would keep jobs. Nokia, which competes with Ericsson ERICb.ST and Huawei [HWT.UL] for 5G networks, said in a statement the staff reduction was needed because of significant cost pressures. Nokia said in April it aimed to cut costs by 500 million euros ($560.30 million) by the end of this year compared with full-year 2018, with 350 million euros targeted to come from operating expenses and 150 million from sales costs. When Nokia bought Alcatel-Lucent International, it pledged to preserve jobs in France for two years and to expand research and development teams in the country to create a resource within the group for 5G technology. The French research and development teams are particularly affected by the job cuts. “Nokia must improve this job cuts plan really significantly,” an official at the French finance ministry official said on condition of anonymity. Nokia became free from the commitments it made this month, a spokeswoman said, while the company’s president in France said Nokia would still be a big source of jobs. “Nokia will continue to be a major employer in France with a strong foothold in R&D, sales and services, which will enable us to develop and execute our customers’ projects efficiently,” Thierry Boisnon, president of Nokia in France, said in written comments. Nokia employs 5,138 people in France, of which 3,640 work for Alcatel-Lucent International. The entity was part of the Alcatel-Lucent group before Nokia bought it in 2015 in an all-share deal that valued the French business at 15.6 billion euros. The merger was scrutinised by the French government and its then economy minister Emmanuel Macron, who is now president. “It’s just a low-cost strategy that is being implemented, contrary to all the commitments made by Nokia in France. Nokia is laughing at everyone, first and foremost the French government,” the CFE-CGC union at Nokia said on its website."

At the end of April, Nokia’s Suri told Reuters in an interview that Nokia had won a 10% share of China Unicom’s 5G core network, alongside rivals Huawei and ZTE. “The core network performs a variety of functions, including setting up connections, bandwidth management, scaling and securing the network, and, now with 5G, opening up the network to support new, software-enabled use cases such as network slicing,” Nokia said. Despite progress in its core network sales in China, Nokia has been on the sidelines for larger China radio network orders, which include masts, antennas and other equipment.

Nokia initially chose a type of chip -- Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) -- for its 5G equipment that customers could reprogramme but high costs and supply hurdles last year forced it to change course. “We still stand by the decision of going with FPGAs because it was the right thing to do at that time,” Sandro Tavares, Nokia’s head of mobile networks marketing, told Reuters. “When we announced the shift in strategy, the market evolved faster and we needed to speed up the process of developing new suppliers,” he said. Nokia, which competes with Sweden’s Ericsson and China’s Huawei [HWT.UL], had said its 5G products could not reach the market in time due to delays by one supplier, identified by analysts as Intel. It is now using cheaper custom chips to bring down costs and adding more suppliers to diversify its supply. Tavares declined to comment on when Nokia’s 5G equipment with Broadcom chips would hit the market or if Nokia would add more suppliers. Reducing the cost of its chips is a key performance indicator for Nokia and in the first quarter it said 17% of its 5G equipment had custom chips, up from about 10% at the end of 2019. By the end of this year, Nokia aims to have the custom chips in more than 35% of its 5G shipments and to reach a rate of 100% by the end of 2022. Nokia has said it expects its gross margins to improve as it increases shipments of 5G products with custom chips."

-9.292035398230087," Nokia's broadband business boosted as COVID-19 pressures networks (Reuters) - Finnish telecom equipment maker Nokia is seeing a pick up in orders as its broadband clients race to upgrade networks to meet higher user demand during the COVID-19 pandemic, a company executive said. Many customers had planned to grow their network by 30% to 40% over the next few years assuming a similar growth in traffic, but COVID-19 brought in that traffic growth overnight, Sandy Motley, Nokia’s President of Fixed Networks, told Reuters. “Customers will need to accelerate the growth that they had planned in the future, and we’ve seen customers already talking to us about that,” she said, adding orders for fixed networks were up 22% in the first quarter. Nokia boosted its fixed-line networks business with the 2016 purchase of Alcatel-Lucent in a 15.6 billion-euro ($17 billion) deal. The unit’s revenue fell 18% year-on-year in the first quarter and 5% between 2018 and 2019 but Motley said the decline was due to business cycles. “We have seen some upgrades from our customers... but we think a lot of this drive will be more medium term and long term,” Motley said. The European Commission has proposed that by 2025 all European households, rural or urban, should have access to networks offering download speeds of at least 100 MBps. It takes time to build a new fixed network as the installation of fiber cabling can’t be done overnight, Stefaan Vanhastel, CTO of Nokia’s fixed networks business, told Reuters. “Certainly we see that operators are starting to consider accelerating fiber rollouts,” he said. Fixed broadband carries about 90% of all internet traffic in Europe, according to a report by research firm Analysys Mason. In 2019, Nokia’s Fixed Access business amounted to around 10% of the company’s main networks business sales, with Mobile Access accounting for 64%."
3.6613272311212848," Canadian telcos tap Ericsson, Nokia for 5G gear, ditching Huawei TORONTO/BENGALURU (Reuters) - Two of Canada's largest telecoms firms on Tuesday teamed with Sweden's Ericsson ERICb.ST and Finland's Nokia Oyj NOKIA.HE to build fifth-generation (5G) telecoms networks, ditching China's Huawei Technologies for the project. Bell Canada BCE.TO and smaller rival Telus Corp T.TO eschewed Huawei, which analysts said would ease the Canadian government's thorny decision on whether to allow the company into Canada's 5G network. Bell, Canada's second-largest cellphone provider by wireless revenue, announced it would partner with Ericsson for its core 5G network. Previously, it said Nokia would provide other parts of its 5G tech. Telus picked Ericsson and Nokia as its equipment suppliers, the company said in a separate statement. Rogers Communications RCIb.TO, the other dominant telecoms operator, has already partnered with Ericsson. Last week, a Canadian court dealt a setback to Huawei Chief Financial Officer Meng Wanzhou as she tries to avoid extradition to the United States to face bank fraud charges. Canada, which is reviewing security implications of 5G networks, has yet to decide on allowing Huawei to provide equipment for them. The announcements put “a real monkey wrench into the spanner” for Huawei’s business ambitions in Canada, said Lawrence Surtees, lead research analyst on communications at IDC Canada. Although Huawei has contracts with smaller companies, and continues to provide some tech for Bell’s network, the two companies “are substantial contracts and it’s a nice piece of business for whoever gets it,” he said. Huawei said it supports Bell’s strategy of selecting multiple equipment suppliers, referring to the Canadian telecom firm’s relationship with Huawei to supply other network components. Telecoms companies were in a bind due to the government’s indecision. “There is now equipment certainty and the use of multiple suppliers is an excellent strategy to help stimulate innovation and discipline pricing,” Mark Goldberg, a telecoms industry consultant, said. On Tuesday, Telefonica Deutschland O2Dn.DE picked Ericsson to build its 5G core mobile network in Germany, saying the choice would safeguard the security of its next-generation services.

Baldauf, one of the most high-profile female executives in the global telecoms industry, faces a tough task to fight back in the 5G race, as rivals Ericsson ERICb.ST and Huawei put pressure on its sales and cash reserves. Nokia, which axed its dividend after a profit warning last October, has been trying to tackle costs and shipment delays. In a video address to shareholders for the company’s annual general meeting, Siilasmaa applauded Baldauf’s “wealth of experience” and gave assurances that she would focus on improving financial results. Outgoing Chief Executive Rajeev Suri, who will hand over to Pekka Lundmark in September, said the company will emerge from the coronavirus crisis stronger than before, and had a strengthened supply chain with 25 factories around the globe. Nokia has been hampered by delays in its system-on-chip (SoC) development - an entire computer system on a single chip which allows the company to cut costs. Suri said the integration of former French-American rival Alcatel-Lucent, which Nokia acquired for 15.6 billion euros ($17.17 billion) in 2016, had not been easy but was now complete, both operationally and culturally. “At the same time, the 5G market timeline accelerated...we had to accelerate our development efforts and this did not happen without challenges,” Suri said.

Nokia did not disclose how many workers at the plant in Sriperumbudur in the southern state of Tamil Nadu tested positive, but a source familiar with the matter said they were at least 42. The company said it had already implemented measures such as social distancing and changes to canteen facilities. The factory had begun operations in a restricted manner over the past few weeks, Nokia said in a statement, after India eased the world’s biggest lockdown to kick-start its economy which has been pummelled by the shutdown. “We hope to resume operations soon at a restricted level with skeletal staff strength,” Nokia added. Chinese smartphone maker OPPO last week suspended operations at a recently re-opened plant on the outskirts of Indian capital New Delhi after at least nine workers tested positive for the novel coronavirus. The outbreaks at Nokia and OPPO underline the challenges of easing the two-month nationwide lockdown. India on Tuesday recorded a total of 145,380 coronavirus infections and a death toll of 4,167, comparatively low figures for the world’s second-most populous country."

24.301675977653634," Nokia says won share of China Unicom 5G core network order (Reuters) - Nokia has won a share of China Unicom’s 5G core network order alongside Huawei and ZTE, Nokia’s Chief Executive Rajeev Suri told Reuters in an interview, citing information published by the telecom operator. “We are the only foreign supplier in China Unicom for 5G core,” Suri said. Nokia provides a wide range of telecom equipment in the China market but saw its Greater China revenue drop 29% year-on-year in January-March. China Unicom was not immediately available for comment, but had listed Nokia on its website as the number three winner, behind Huawei and ZTE, for the “2020 China Unicom 5GC Centralized Procurement Project”, covering two core network projects. “It should be about 10% market share in 5G core and about 17% in virtualized IMS,” Suri added, referring to virtual IP Multimedia Subsystems, which deliver real-time communication services. The core network is where the most critical controls are located and the most sensitive information is stored, while the peripheral radio network is typically larger and includes masts, antennas and other passive equipment. Nokia has been on sidelines for larger China radio orders which often mean taking losses in the early years of a contract. According to media reports, Nokia did not win any 5G radio contracts from Chinese telecom companies - China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom - in recent bidding rounds. Nokia said it expected to remain a “meaningful player” in China through its wide telecom portfolio even though pursuing 5G radio network market share presents significant profitability challenges. Suri said, for 5G radio equipment markets, China was a large part of the global market but not so much from a revenue standpoint. “So people only speak about the volume share being 50, 60 percent. But when it comes to the revenue share, the value share of that market, it’s about half that,” he added. “And then the profit share in the medium term is actually negligible as part of the global market.”"

The Finnish company said the bulk of the coronavirus impact will be felt in the current quarter. Its revenue slipped 2% in the first three months of the year as it took a hit of about 200 million euros ($217 million) largely because the pandemic disrupted supply from operations in China. Nokia, battling with China's Huawei and Sweden's Ericsson ERICb.ST, is trying to strengthen its 5G slate and looking especially to deployment by U.S. telecom companies for growth. Ericsson and Huawei both increased their revenue in the first quarter, helped by strong demand as telecom services help to keep businesses working remotely during the pandemic. Nokia expects a seasonally strong second half when it will have new leadership as former executive Pekka Lundmark from energy group Fortum FORTUM.HE is due to replace Chief Executive Rajeev Suri in September. It trimmed its full-year earnings forecast to 23 euro cents from 25 cents, but shares in the company were up by 2.7% by 0900 GMT. China has been a weak spot for Nokia but CEO Suri said the company had won a 10% share of China Unicom's 5G core network order, with Huawei and ZTE 000063.SZ taking most of the order. “We are the only foreign supplier in China Unicom for 5G core,” Suri told Reuters in an interview. According to media reports, Nokia did not win any 5G radio contracts from Chinese telecom companies - China Mobile, China Unicom and China Telecom - in recent bidding rounds.

As the COVID-19 situation develops, however, an increase in supply and delivery challenges in a number of countries is possible and some customers may re-assess their spending plans,” Suri said in a statement. Nokia generated first quarter underlying profit of 1 cent per share, broadly matching analysts’ forecasts, according to Refinitiv data based on 10 analysts.

25.513196480938415," Nokia quarterly revenue to get 5G boost before coronavirus impact felt (Reuters) - Nokia Oyj NOKIA.HE is expected to report a rise in revenue for the first three months of the year, backed by higher sales of 5G equipment, before feeling the effects of supply chain disruption in the current quarter. The Finnish company, battling with China's Huawei [HWT.UL] and Sweden's Ericsson ERICb.ST, is trying to strengthen its 5G slate and looking to deployment by U.S. telecom companies for growth. Nokia, which will publish earnings on April 30, is expected to report revenue of 5.1 billion euros ($5.55 billion), up 1.25% from a year earlier, according to Refinitiv data based on eight analysts. Analysts also estimate the company to break even in the quarter compared with an underlying loss of 2 cents per share in the same period last year. Nokia, which axed its dividend after a profit warning last October, is awaiting the arrival of former executive Pekka Lundmark from energy group Fortum FORTUM.HE in September who will replace Rajeev Suri. Both Ericsson and Huawei have posted growth in revenue in the first quarter of the year, helped by strong demand as telecom services help to keep businesses working remotely during the pandemic. While Ericsson has flagged near-term supply disruptions, Huawei has also faced a political backlash over alleged use of networking equipment to spy for the Chinese government, which the company has denied. Nokia has been hampered by delays in its 5G system-on-chip (SoC) development, which allows a single chip to carry an entire computer system and should enable it to produce its network technology more cheaply. In the latest contract awards by China Mobile 0941.HK, the world's largest telecom company, Nokia missed out entirely. Nokia also didn’t win any 5G contracts from China Unicom [0762.HK] and China Telecom [0728.HK], according to media reports. However, it was not clear if Nokia had chosen to opt out rather than chase business at any price. “We remain a long-term player in China and our commitment to China remains, but as you know, we have always taken disciplined approach to our business in China, which is focused on profitability as opposed to market share,” Nokia told Reuters in an emailed statement. Nokia, however, is set to grow this year in North America, its biggest market. After the completion of a merger, the combined T-Mobile TMUS.O and Sprint is pushing ahead with the rollout of 5G. That bodes well for Nokia - a key supplier to both. “Samsung historically had 1/3 share at Sprint, and we believe this share may shift more to Nokia as part of a new strategy,” BofA analysts said. Its other customers, AT&T T.N and Verizon VZ.N, have also earmarked billions of dollars to deploy 5G. Nokia shares, which took a beating last year, recovered some of those losses after rumors here surfaced that it may be a takeover target. “We must also note, especially given recent M&A rumors, that Nokia’s minimal participation in China 5G markets may increase its attractiveness in the US 5G ‘national champion’ acquisition scenario,” Northland Capital analyst Tim Savageaux wrote in a note."

The telecoms network equipment maker flagged the investigation a year ago in its 2018 annual report, news which hit its shares in March 2019. Nokia did not unveil details, but said the risks were limited. “We have seen no evidence that would suggest that criminal penalties would apply in this case, and we believe it is highly likely that any penalties that might apply would be limited and immaterial,” Nokia said. The telecoms sector has seen a number of relatively large deals in recent years: Nokia itself bought Siemens out from their mobile networks’ joint venture in 2013, and Alcatel-Lucent - which Nokia bought in 2016 - was a result of a 2006 merger.

The mobile telecom network industry has consolidated heavily in the past decade, with Nokia buying out Siemens from a venture and acquiring Alcatel-Lucent, leaving just three global players. Large telecom operators see three vendors as a bare minimum for keeping competition alive in the industry. They typically try to use several vendors for their networks.

-20.737327188940093," Mobile World Congress in Barcelona called off over coronavirus fears BARCELONA/BERLIN/PARIS (Reuters) - The Mobile World Congress (MWC), the annual telecoms industry gathering that draws more than 100,000 visitors to Barcelona, was canceled on Wednesday after a mass exodus by exhibitors due to fears over the coronavirus outbreak. Bowing to the inevitable, the GSMA telecoms association that hosts the get-together said it had canceled the Feb. 24-27 event despite assurances from local and national health officials that it would have been safe to hold it. “The GSMA has canceled MWC Barcelona 2020 because the global concern regarding the coronavirus outbreak, travel concern and other circumstances, make it impossible for the GSMA to hold the event,” John Hoffman, the CEO of organizer GSMA, said in a statement. The announcement followed a crisis meeting of the GSMA board, after its hand was forced by the pullout of anchor European members including Deutsche Telekom DTEGn.DE, Vodafone VOD.L, BT BT.L and Nokia NOKIA.HE. Spain’s Telefonica, one of the biggest telecom operators not to have announced it was pulling out, said on Wednesday evening it “understands the GSMA’s decision to cancel the Mobile World Congress 2020 due to the situation generated by coronavirus.” It said it would always support Barcelona as host city of the Mobile World Congress. Barcelona’s mayor, Ada Colau, said earlier she wanted to send a “message of calm,” insisting the city was ready to host the event, while Spanish health officials reiterated that there was no reason to call off MWC. The World Health Organisation, a UN agency leading the coronavirus crisis response, had also called in vain for calm. “There is no evidence at present to suggest that there is community spread outside China, so WHO is not currently requesting that large gatherings are canceled,” WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic told Reuters in Geneva. That failed, however, to alleviate concerns among major exhibitors that the precautions would be insufficient to halt the virus, which has spread beyond China’s borders to two dozen countries. “To bring people together and connect them: That is what Telekom stands for. This is also what the Mobile World Congress, the ‘class reunion’ of our industry, stands for,” Deutsche Telekom CEO Tim Hoettges posted on LinkedIn. But he said that large gatherings of people with many international guests posed a particular risk: “To take this risk would be irresponsible.” The Chinese contingent at MWC has numbered 5,000-6,000 in recent years, making the event particularly vulnerable given the outbreak of the virus that has killed more than 1,100 people on the Chinese mainland. The GSMA said the host cities and partners respected and understood its decision, adding that they would “continue to be working in unison” towards staging next year’s event. Hoffman and Colau are to hold a joint press conference on Thursday. Due to the sheer scale of MWC, with delegates packing out Barcelona’s hotels and restaurants and causing the city’s trade fair grounds to burst at the seams, postponement was never a realistic option, sources said. A final decision was made harder by the terms under which any events insurance taken out by the GSMA would pay out, industry sources and insurance experts said. This would be unlikely to kick in unless restrictions are imposed on public gatherings in the country on health grounds. “Where there is no ban and businesses make their own commercial decision, I cannot see the market paying out,” Edel Ryan, who is on the Special Risks team at broker Marsh JLT Specialty, said before the GSMA’s decision. Major Chinese exhibitors, led by Huawei, had stuck to plans to attend to the very last, ordering at-risk staff to isolate themselves in advance and drafting in replacements from elsewhere to run event stands and host clients. The GSMA had banned attendees from China’s Hubei province, where the coronavirus outbreak began, and required others to prove that they had been outside the country for at least two weeks prior to the event. Coronavirus has proved to be contagious even when people who have caught it are asymptomatic, meaning that people attending might not even realize that they could infect others at MWC. Tracking the meetings and movements across the Fira trade grounds and the city of Barcelona of anyone who later tests positive would be a difficult task."
-18.764302059496572," Pence dismisses idea of U.S. buying Nokia, Ericsson to challenge Huawei WASHINGTON, Feb 7 (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Mike Pence on Friday declined to endorse an unusual suggestion from U.S. Attorney General William Barr that the United States consider taking control of two major foreign rivals of China-based Huawei Technologies Co Ltd. Barr, a former general counsel at Verizon Communications Inc , said on Thursday the United States and its allies should consider taking a “controlling stake” in Finland’s Nokia and Sweden’s Ericsson to counter Huawei’s dominance in next-generation 5G wireless technology. Pence suggested an alternative approach when asked by CNBC for his response. “Great respect to Attorney General Barr, but we believe the best way forward is what Ajit Pai announced just over the last several days,” Pence said, referring to the Federal Communications Commission’s chairman’s efforts to free up more spectrum for 5G wireless use. “That’s the plan the president has endorsed and will be carrying forward,” Pence said, adding that the United States can expand 5G “by using the power of the free market and American companies.” A spokeswoman for Barr declined to comment. The White House and a spokesman for Pai did not immediately comment. Shares in Nokia rose 4% and Ericsson shares were up nearly 5% Friday. Both companies declined to comment. Nokia and Ericsson have a combined market capitalization of about $53 billion and it is unclear what source of funds the U.S. government could potentially tap to take stakes in the firms or if foreign regulators would approve. In a remarkable statement underscoring how far the United States may be willing to go to counter Huawei, Barr on Thursday disclosed proposals “by the United States aligning itself with Nokia and/or Ericsson.” Barr said the alignment could take place “through American ownership of a controlling stake, either directly or through a consortium of private American and allied companies.” Barr said that “putting our large market and financial muscle behind one or both of these firms would make it a far more formidable competitor and eliminate concerns over its staying power, or their staying power.” “We and our closest allies certainly need to be actively considering this approach,” he added.

-17.619047619047624," Nokia's surprise profit rise fails to salvage 2019 dividend HELSINKI (Reuters) - Cost cuts provided an unexpected boost to Nokia's NOKIA.HE fourth-quarter underlying profit on Thursday, driving its share price to a four-month high, although the Finnish telecom company said it was not ready to propose a dividend. Nokia lowered its outlook in October and halted dividend payouts, blaming a need to step up investments in 5G and knocking more than a fifth from its value. On Thursday, Nokia said its underlying earnings for the quarter ending in December rose to 0.15 euros per share from 0.13 euros per share a year ago, above the 0.13 euros consensus in a Refinitiv poll. The results sent its shares up 7% in early trade, to the highest level since the October warning, and they were up 3.4% at 1009 GMT. “There are small steps towards a better future,” Inderes analyst Mikael Rautanen said in a research note. Nokia Chief Executive Rajeev Suri told journalists the fourth quarter had marked “a strong end to a challenging year”. The company predicted the final quarter of 2020 would also see a concentration of operating profit and free cash flow, but said there were also still problems ahead. The board would not propose a dividend for 2019 as it only expected to reach the 2 billion euro cash position it sees sufficient for profit distribution during the fourth quarter. Analysts were expecting a dividend of 0.11 euros, according to a Refinitiv poll. Nokia also repeated its forecast for 2020 underlying earnings per share of between 0.20 and 0.30 euros, compared to 0.22 euros in 2019. Its warning in October was partly caused by investments in its 5G system-on-chip (SoC) development, which allows a single chip to carry an entire computer system and enables Nokia to produce its network technology more cheaply. Suri said that by the end of 2019 10% of Nokia’s 5G offering was using system-on-chip, and that rate would increase to over 35% during 2020 and to 70% in 2021. Nokia, which competes with Ericsson ERICb.ST and Huawei for 5G network deals, said it expects intense competition to continue in 2020, as rivals seek to grab market share. Suri told Reuters the company aimed to focus on its most profitable operations in China and make only prudent offers for large 5G radio network deals that are expected to become available. Sales in the Greater China region dropped by 25% in the fourth quarter to 469 million euros. Group sales were flat at 6.9 billion euros as declines in China and North America were balanced by growth in Asia-Pacific, a region where Nokia flagged new challenges. In India, it said customer demand could weaken after the country’s Supreme Court upheld a ruling that telecoms companies must pay retroactive license and spectrum fees."

-7.7319587628865944," Breakingviews - Will IBM be the next Microsoft or Nokia? NEW YORK (Reuters Breakingviews) - Arvind Krishna, IBM’s incoming chief executive, has a tough task ahead of him. He will replace current boss Virginia Rometty in April, the company announced on Thursday. Shareholders won’t miss her: At $121 billion, Big Blue’s market value has almost halved since she took the reins at the start of 2012. It now has a reputation as a former hardware provider that lost its way when the world moved on. Microsoft’s resurgence under boss Satya Nadella offers the best path ahead. The two companies were both worth roughly $220 billion when Rometty took charge of IBM. One of her recent strategic moves even echoes those of former Microsoft boss Steve Ballmer. He paid way above the odds for a couple of companies in an attempt to leave behind the company’s stodgy image - before being effectively forced out in 2014. Rometty, meanwhile, splashed out too much in her $34 billion acquisition of Red Hat unveiled in 2018. Nadella managed to get past Ballmer’s deals, despite adding a pricey-looking takeover of his own with LinkedIn, and has overseen a largely successful upgrade and expansion of its software while also growing its cloud-computing business, where revenue grew 62% in its most recent quarter. That makes it the main contender to industry leader Amazon. Over the past eight years the value of the company has increased six-fold to $1.3 trillion. There’s plenty that could go wrong, of course. Krishna, who currently leads the cloud division, was instrumental in the Red Hat deal. That was designed to catapult IBM into the cloud business but has yet to show the purchase was worth the price paid. The fate of Finnish telecom company Nokia provides an instrumental lesson on how turnaround attempts can spiral down. It was once, like IBM, a dominant hardware maker before falling on hard times. It sold part of its business to Microsoft – one of Ballmer’s bad deals – and shares in the rest now trade at just 6% of their market high in 2000. Yahoo is another tale of woe. The Internet giant’s main business lost almost all of its value during a 10-year period before it was sold to Verizon. Krishna has to push to be in Microsoft’s camp, but he’s got his work cut out for him."
-16.50246305418718," Finnish state investor raps Nokia for poor communication on profit dive HELSINKI (Reuters) - The head of Finland’s state investment firm Solidium criticised Nokia for poor communication on Thursday and said he had sent management some “feisty feedback” after its sudden profit warning in October. “We were very disappointed by the radical change in (Nokia’s) guidance and above all in their communications about it,” Solidium’s Chief Executive Antti Makinen told Reuters in a sharp rebuke to the company from its biggest shareholder. On Oct. 24 Nokia slashed its 2019 and 2020 profit outlook and halted dividend payouts, saying the company would need to spend more to fend off rivals in the fast-growing 5G networks business. Makinen criticized what he called Nokia’s passive approach towards its owners and investors, especially the fact that Nokia, unlike its rival Ericsson, has for years chosen not to hold capital market days to outline its strategy. “They have communicated their development to investors rather poorly and we gave them some feisty feedback for it,” Makinen said. Solidium contributed 338 million euros ($375 million) to Finland’s state budget last year but expects Nokia’s dividend cut to reduce this in 2020. Its full-year 2019 return on equity holdings was 15% but for the last six months it fell into the red at -1.4%, burdened by a 33% drop over 12 months in its return from Nokia.

The 5G drive comes as the joint venture is caught in a legal appeal process against an antitrust regulator’s move to block its proposed A$15 billion mega-merger with TPG Telecom Ltd . In a joint statement, the companies said Vodafone Hutchison Australia, the 50-50 joint venture, would kick off its 5G rollout in the first half of 2020 with Nokia as the network vendor. “They (Nokia) presented a compelling roadmap that aligned with our 5G objectives and will help us to continue improving our 4G network for our customers,” Vodafone Chief Executive Officer Iñaki Berroeta said in the statement. The Finnish telecom network equipment maker has already built a test network to demonstrate its 5G technology, and those sites will become the first area of commercial coverage for Vodafone’s 5G network. The partnership was the final step in a long process, Vodafone’s Berroeta said, following the security guidance given by the country’s federal government in August 2018. Australia expanded its national security rules to exclude telecommunication equipment suppliers that it believes have ties to foreign governments, a move that disallowed Huawei Technologies Co Ltd from the country’s 5G rollout. Nokia has been a beneficiary of restrictions in Western nations on market access to Huawei over allegations that China could use its equipment for espionage, a charge that Huawei has repeatedly denied.

The move, if it leads to a successful outcome, could stave off a possible EU antitrust investigation following complaints by Daimler, Bury Technologies, Continental, Valeo and Thales-owned Gemalto to the European Commission. The Finnish telecoms equipment maker and Daimler have been at loggerheads on who should apply and pay royalties on technologies key to navigation to systems, vehicle communications and self-driving cars. “We expect the mediation to take place soon and look forward to constructive dialogue with all parties with the aim of reaching an amicable and definitive resolution,” Nokia said in a statement. It made the mediation proposal last week and also offered to negotiate with car parts makers instead of Daimler, a move welcomed by European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager. Nokia’s usual practice is to license its technologies at the car level, whereas Daimler says component makers should also be able to apply for them."
-3.2163742690058443," Nokia halts legal action against Daimler with mediation offer in patent row BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Finnish telecoms equipment maker Nokia has suspended legal action against German carmaker Daimler in the hope that mediation will resolve their dispute over technology licensing fees. However the decision drew a cool response from Daimler, which reiterated that the two companies had different legal opinions on the dispute. Nokia’s pursuit of fees from Daimler has thrown a spotlight on the wider battle between tech companies and the car industry over royalties for technologies essential for navigation systems, vehicle communications and self-driving cars. Daimler, along with Bury Technologies, Continental, Valeo and Thales-owned Gemalto complained to the European Commission this year about fees demanded by Nokia for patents related to car communications. Nokia has in recent years initiated 10 court cases against Daimler in Germany for alleged patent infringements. Daimler, meanwhile, has issued its own lawsuits against Nokia. However, Nokia said on Monday that constructive negotiation was the best way to resolve matters, having last week offered to enter into independent mediation as part of efforts to avoid an EU antitrust investigation. “To ensure there is time for this mediation to be successful, we have unilaterally chosen to postpone the pending hearing on 10 December in Germany,” Nokia spokesman Mark Durrant said. “We trust that Daimler and its tier 1 suppliers will now engage in these meaningful efforts to reach settlement. There is more to gain for all if we work together.” Daimler declined to comment on Nokia’s move, reiterating its previous stance. “We have a different legal opinion on the question of how to license essential patents for telecommunications standards in the automotive industry. Nokia has so far refused to license our suppliers directly on a comprehensive basis,” the German company said. EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager however welcomed the mediation efforts, saying the postponement of the court hearing was a positive move. “This is why we think it is a good thing that they now try mediation at the International Chamber of Commerce,” she told reporters. “It would be a good thing if there could be a mutual understanding.” Nokia has also offered to negotiate with the car parts makers instead of only Daimler on licensing fees. Carmakers argue that car parts makers should deal with the licensing fees rather than them and that patent holders should be open to negotiations with whichever company is interested in using their patents. Sources had told Reuters that EU competition enforcers had been poised to open an investigation into the matter until Nokia made the mediation offer."
9.221902017291061," Nokia names veteran Sari Baldauf as group boss to take on 5G challenge (Reuters) - Telecoms equipment maker Nokia NOKIA.HE announced on Tuesday that it plans to appoint its former networks chief Sari Baldauf as chairman, succeeding Risto Siilasmaa who will step down after eight years in the job. Taking on the top job at Nokia will make Baldauf, 64, one of the most high-profile female executives in the telecoms industry globally. She faces the task of catching up with rivals Huawei and Ericsson in 5G, after Nokia in October cut its outlook for this year and next because of the need to step up its investments - news that knocked a third off its share price. It also suspended dividend payments to conserve cash and pledged to speed up the introduction of new 5G chipsets. Baldauf headed Nokia's networks unit - now the company's main business - between 1998 and 2005. She has sat on Nokia's board of directors since last year and has also sat on the boards of companies including Daimler DAIGn.DE, Deutsche Telekom DTEGn.DE and Akzo Nobel AKZO.AS and Finnish utility Fortum FORTUM.HE. “I think it is a hugely positive move to see a woman take such an important role in such a prestigious business,” said Ben Wood, head of research at UK-based tech consultancy CCS Insight. Wood has followed Nokia for nearly 20 years. Baldauf said in a statement on Tuesday that she sees a clear opportunity to help create long-term shareholder value, working with CEO Rajeev Suri. “Rajeev and his team are working hard to address both the short-term issues and strengthen Nokia’s longer-term value drivers,” she said. Her appointment is subject to shareholder approval at the group’s annual general meeting in April. Baldauf is the last remaining executive from former chairman and CEO Jorma Ollila’s team which in the late 1990s built a Finnish company with a tiny tech unit into the world’s biggest cellphone maker. “Nokia is going back to the future! The recent profit warning, dividend cut and 5G lag have rattled the company,” said Neil Mawston, director at research firm Strategy Analytics. “Huawei and Ericsson have arguably inched ahead on R&D, and Nokia is feeling the business pressure. Nokia is turning to the old “dream team” for help,” Mawston said. Siilasmaa, 53, played a central role in revamping Nokia from cellphone maker with a network arm into a top three telecom equipment maker globally.

12.680115273775213," BT looks for new broadband equipment supplier for Openreach's full-fiber rollout (Reuters) - Britain’s BT Group Plc is looking for a new broadband equipment supplier as it plans to roll out full-fiber broadband to millions of homes by the mid-2020s, the communications services company said on Monday. BT’s fixed-line network arm Openreach has started an evaluation process seeking a third strategic vendor alongside telecoms gear makers Nokia Oyj and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd for the rollout, Richard Knowles, an Openreach spokesman, told Reuters. The development comes as the United States has been pressing nations not to grant Huawei access to 5G networks and alleged that Huawei’s equipment could be used by Beijing for spying, which the Chinese company has repeatedly denied. “We already manage a large and diverse supply chain across our full fiber build, and we’re constantly reviewing our options to make sure we can carry on building a high-quality network that offers great value for money”, Knowles said. “We’re on track to make faster, more reliable full fiber broadband available to four million premises by March 2021”, he added. Full-fibre broadband is an internet connection that is entirely served by a fiber optic cable. Bloomberg reported earlier BT will be seeking proposals from potential suppliers by January aiming to make a decision in the second quarter next year and that U.S.-based vendors are expected to bid. In May, U.S President Donald Trump signed an executive order barring U.S. companies from using telecommunications equipment made by companies posing a national security risk. The Trump administration also added Huawei to its trade blacklist in May, citing national security concerns. The question of whether Huawei’s 5G equipment could contain back doors allowing access to Chinese spying has been dividing countries in the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing network. The United States, Australia and New Zealand have bans in place, while Britain has been taking a less firm line, indicating Huawei’s 5G products could be used in less sensitive areas. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had postponed a decision on whether to use Huawei 5G network equipment until after the October federal election and has not commented on the issue since winning the Oct. 21 vote."

Erlemeier, who has been with the company for 25 years and served as chief operations officer for the past two years, was responsible for global operations and procurement, the overall operating model and implementation of cost savings, among other functions.

HELSINKI (Reuters) - The head of Nokia’s software business Bhaskar Gorti defended the Finnish mobile network maker on Wednesday against market fears that it is lagging behind its peers Ericsson and Huawei [HWT.UL] in 5G development. “I don’t think we have a 5G problem,” Gorti told Reuters in an interview, calling its development a marathon where a lot of focus had been put on the first ten minutes of the race. Last month Nokia cut its outlook for this year and next because of the need to step up its investments in 5G - news that knocked a third off its share price. It also suspended dividend payments to conserve cash and pledged to hurry up the introduction of new 5G chipsets. That was in sharp contrast to Sweden’s Ericsson, which had lifted its market forecast for this year and its sales target for 2020 just a week earlier. Nokia was wrong-footed by waiting for 5G radio standards to enter force late last year, while rivals were quicker to revamp products in anticipation of early rollouts in the United States and Korea, industry sources and analysts told Reuters. Amit Hirchandani, sector analyst at Citi in London, calls Nokia a “show me” story in which it must demonstrate clear progress on fixing and deploying its 5G products in the coming months to restore investor confidence. Gorti said the 5G cycle consisted of several different parts, adding he believed Nokia to be ahead its peers in aspects such as software development, internet of things deployments or fixed wireless access. “I personally think we have an at least 2 to 3 years or more lead on our nearest competitor Ericsson (in software),” he said. The operating profit from Nokia’s software business grew 108% to 156 million euros ($172.6 million) year-on-year in the third quarter, topping the profit from Nokia’s long-time main business the networks at 128 million for the quarter. Gorti said it was important to understand that 80% of the mobile network is actually software and that the virtualization of networks would only speed up for new 5G networks. Virtualization means that mobile network hardware can increasingly be replaced by software operated from a cloud service - a key development for Nokia and its peers to keep up with as virtualization is now entering the radio access network (RAN) technology where most investment has gone so far. Nokia, unlike Ericsson and Huawei, has opted to participate in the development of open RAN technology, promising to support multi-vendor interoperability so that its operator clients are not tied to one vendor only. “We think, if anything, the more things will run on general platforms it will drive the economics better for everybody,” Gorti said, adding Nokia was committed to supporting open RAN development in the future as well.

The telecom and digital services provider said it would kick off its 5G rollout with Nokia - for which it has New Zealand government approval - as part of its staged-approach strategy. Spark said Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Huawei completed its three-company preferred list of suppliers. It has not yet submitted applications, however, for the use of Huawei or Samsung equipment. The use of Huawei Technologies Co Ltd equipment ran into a major roadblock in November 2018 when New Zealand’s intelligence agency rejected Spark’s proposal to use Huawei equipment, citing national security risks. The Chinese company has been under scrutiny over allegations and concerns that China could use Huawei’s equipment for espionage, a charge that Huawei has repeatedly denied. “What we haven’t yet done, is put another application for Huawei,” Spark said. “The point at which we want to start using their equipment as part of this multi-vendor approach, we will put in another application,” the company said in an email. Australia also banned the Chinese telecom giant from supplying 5G equipment to the country in 2018, following a growing trend of Western countries becoming increasingly wary about the rising influence of Chinese companies. Auckland-based Spark said wireless 5G broadband would be introduced in five areas in New Zealand’s South Island before Christmas, and in major centres from mid-2020."
6.010928961748626," Nokia eyes Malaysian ports for 5G business as Huawei takes early lead KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Nokia NOKIA.HE is targeting Malaysian ports in a bid to get a share of the country's fifth-generation (5G) technology market, as the Southeast Asian country prepares to launch the ultra-fast mobile internet service next year. The Finnish company worked with Germany’s Port of Hamburg last year to test the technology in traffic-lights management, data processing from mobile sensors and virtual reality, and is keen to build on that experience in Malaysia, Siva Shanmugam, head of Nokia in Malaysia, told Reuters. Nokia’s push comes at a time when it expects to face tough competition from China’s Huawei [HWT.UL], the world’s largest telecoms equipment maker, that has already signed 5G deals with telecoms firms in Malaysia as it battles a U.S. blacklist. “Nokia is assessing the type of end-to-end use cases for 5G in Malaysia,” Shanmugam said in an email late on Thursday. “One area we are exploring is applying our global learnings to industrial applications; specifically for port operations.” Malaysia is an important shipping center because two of Southeast Asia’s busiest maritime corridors - the Malacca Strait and the South China Sea - run through its waters. The country has seven major federally controlled ports, with Port Klang being the 12th busiest in the world last year. Shanmugam said Nokia was also working with three telecoms customers in Malaysia, including U Mobile, on 5G live trials. Huawei has already signed an agreement with Maxis MXSC.KL, Malaysia's No.2 mobile network operator by subscribers, to launch 5G services. It also has a preliminary 5G deal with Axiata Group Bhd's AXIA.KL Celcom. Huawei has been facing mounting international scrutiny over the past year amid U.S. allegations that its equipment could be used by Beijing for spying, a concern it has said is unfounded. Washington put the Chinese firm on a blacklist in May and has urged its allies to ban Huawei from building 5G networks. Asked how Nokia would counter Huawei’s cost-competitiveness, Shanmugam cited its global footprint of 48 5G commercial deals and “unique end-to-end portfolio”. “This will enable Nokia to provide significant differentiation of 5G use cases in Malaysia,” he said. Nokia, whose other rival in the telecom network equipment business is Sweden's Ericsson ERICb.ST, has hired hundreds of engineers in Finland to speed up its 5G development."
8.493150684931509," Nokia hires 350 workers to speed up 5G development HELSINKI (Reuters) - Telecom network equipment maker Nokia has hired hundreds of engineers in Finland this year to speed up its 5G development, the company said on Wednesday. The Finnish company, rival to Sweden’s Ericsson and China’s Huawei [HWT.UL], slashed its 2019 and 2020 profit outlook last week, saying profit would come under pressure as the company spends more to fend off rivals in the fast-growing 5G networks business. Nokia has recruited 350 staff in Finland this year, 240 in its mobile networks unit and many dedicated to developing SoC (system on chip) integrated circuits - a key element for its 5G equipment, a Nokia spokeswoman said via email. “It is true that we have hired 5G development personnel lately, not only in Oulu but also in Tampere and Espoo,” the head of Nokia’s networks unit Tommi Uitto was quoted saying in Finland’s largest daily Helsingin Sanomat. The company has sped up its hiring since he started in his position a year ago, Uitto added. Nokia shares plunged 21% last Thursday after the company posted disappointing third-quarter results and slashed its outlook. Nokia shares are down 30% this year. Nokia reshuffled its management a year ago, replacing former head of mobile networks Marc Rouanne with Tommi Uitto, a Finn described by the company as an “expert in radio technologies”. “Roughly a year ago I made a change in the networks unit’s leadership. With that I wanted to ensure that we have the right understanding and aim on how we will proceed with 5G. I am convinced that we now have it,” Nokia’s chief executive Rajeev Suri wrote in an emailed statement to the paper. Nokia’s key customers in its biggest 5G market - North America - have limited their spending due to proposed mergers. Last week, Nokia warned about losses from mergers such as T-Mobile US Inc’s proposed $26.5 billion tie-up with Sprint Corp, which in October won formal approval from the Federal Communications Commission. Nokia is a key supplier to both telecoms companies, which have slowed spending as their potential merger faces court challenges. Nokia’s performance is in sharp contrast with that of its Swedish rival Ericsson which last week beat quarterly earnings expectations and lifted its market forecast for this year and its sales target for 2020."

Frankfurt shares .GDAXI touched a 16-month high, pushed higher by a 3.4% gain for the world's largest chemical company BASF after it confirmed its annual outlook even as operating income tumbled 24% in third quarter. Daimler DAIGn.DE rose 3.3% after reporting a slight rise in quarterly operating profit, boosted by sales of Mercedes-Benz cars. Shares of trade-sensitive automakers .SXAP and chemical companies .SX4P, which have taken a toll from a bruising U.S.-China trade war and signs of slowing global growth, rose 1.1% and 0.8%, respectively. The pan-European stocks index .STOXX rose 0.6% to 397.37, its strongest closing level in over 20 months. “We’re seeing a bit of blue sky rather than the torrent of negativity that has generally been associated with both automotives and exporters,” said Edward Park, deputy chief investment officer at London-based firm Brooks Macdonald. “Stock markets are reacting more favourably to those that are beating expectations or at least guiding toward a more positive future.” Healthcare stocks .SXDP rose 1.5%, leading gains among the major European subsectors. AstraZeneca AZN.L jumped 5.6% after lifting its annual drug sales forecast following a surge in revenue from newer cancer treatments. European markets entered the third quarter earnings season this month in nervous form, with signs that Germany was heading into recession weighing on expectations for growth across the region. Data on Thursday showed euro zone business activity stagnated in October as demand withered, according to a survey published on Thursday hours before ECB’s Draghi made his swansong appearance. In response, the euro weakened against the dollar, while eurozone stocks .STOXXE gave up some gains before closing 0.4% higher. At the last press conference of Draghi’s eight-year tenure, the man credited with saving the euro from collapsing kept the door open to even more easy money, days before he hands the reins over to Christine Lagarde on Oct 31. The ECB made no new policy moves on Thursday, having decided in September to restart bond purchases at a pace of 20 billion euros per month while also cutting its deposit rate to -0.5%. “The incoming ECB President, Christine Lagarde, will have plenty on her plate, bearing the weight of Draghi’s legacy with little ammunition left and growing discontent within the Governing Council around the latest QE program,” Andrea Iannelli, investment director at Fidelity International, said in a client note. “She will have to use all her political skills to navigate still-troubled waters, amid trade wars and a slowing domestic economy.” On a sour note, Nokia's shares NOKIA.HE recorded their biggest percentage drop on record, plummeting 23.4% after the company cut its 2019 and 2020 profit outlook due to pressure from rivals in the 5G industry. The telecom maker's report weighed on Helsinki-listed stocks .OMXHPI, which fell 1.5%. Chipmakers came out with mixed results, with Aixtron AIXGn.DE and Siltronic WAFGn.DE reporting a fall in third quarter sales, while Dialog Semiconductor DLGS.DE raised its forecast for the third quarter."
3.8461538461538445," Nokia slashes profit outlook in fight for 5G business, stock drops 21% HELSINKI (Reuters) - Finland's Nokia NOKIA.HE slashed its 2019 and 2020 profit outlook on Thursday, saying profits would come under pressure as the company spends more to fend off rivals in the fast-growing 5G networks business. The telecom network equipment maker, which met third-quarter profit expectations, also said it would pause dividend payments to raise investments in 5G and only resume them when its cash position improves to around 2 billion euros. “Competitive intensity has increased in some accounts as some competitors seek to take share in the early stage of 5G,” it said in a statement. Nokia shares plunged 21% to 3.72 euros in morning trade as the company said key customers in its biggest 5G market -- North America -- were limiting spending due to proposed mergers. Nokia shares are down 30% this year. Nokia, which together with Sweden’s Ericsson ERICb.ST and Huawei , sells the bulk of radio access network equipment that is key for 5G mobile services, cut back its earlier ambition on market share gains for 2019 and 2020. It now sees its sales growing in line with market growth. “The report was a major disappointment ... outlook was cut across the board reflecting the company’s continuing stumbles as the new cycle of network market is starting to take off,” Inderes analyst Mikael Rautanen said in a note. 5G networks are at the centre of a brewing technology war between United States and China, as they are expected to host critical functions from driverless vehicles to smart electric grids and military communications. Some analysts say the Nordic companies may benefit from challenges Huawei faces after Washington alleged its equipment could be used by Beijing for spying - an accusation which Huawei denies. Nokia said security concerns could drive new business, potentially offsetting losses from mergers such as T-Mobile US Inc's TMUS.O proposed $26.5 billion tie-up with Sprint Corp S.N which in October won formal approval from the Federal Communications Commission. The company is a key supplier to both telecoms companies, which have slowed spending as their potential merger faces court challenges. “Some customers are reassessing their vendors in light of security concerns, creating near-term pressure to invest in order to secure long-term benefits,” the company said. Nokia’s report contrasts with that of rival Ericsson which last week beat quarterly earnings expectations and lifted its market forecast for this year and its sales target for 2020. The Swedish firm said demand for superfast 5G networks was taking off more quickly than expected. Nokia now sees 2019 underlying earnings per share (EPS) at 0.18-0.24 euros and 2020 EPS at 0.20-0.30 euros. Those were lowered from earlier forecasts of 0.25-0.29 euros and 0.37-0.42 euros. “Forecasting is not perfect in this industry,” CEO Rajeev Suri told Reuters. Nokia reported a slip in underlying earnings to 0.05 euros per share in the July-September quarter, compared to 0.06 euros a year earlier, but in line with a 0.05 euro forecast in a Refinitiv poll. Nokia said it now has 48 commercial 5G deals and 15 live networks. It reported third-quarter net sales of 5.7 billion euros versus 5.5 billion a year earlier. Nokia said it expected fourth-quarter profit of 0.135 euros per share, below the EPS of 0.14-0.18 euros expected by analysts Refinitiv data showed."
-32.89719626168225," Nokia says Brazil 5G auction may be world's biggest yet SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Finnish telecoms equipment maker Nokia Oyj expects Brazil to host the world’s biggest-ever single auction for fifth-generation (5G) spectrum next year, a senior executive told Reuters. After partnering with Uruguayan state-run carrier Antel to deploy the first 5G network in Latin America, Nokia is setting its sights on Brazil, its biggest market in the region. “We see the political will to carry out a large spectrum auction in the first quarter of 2020. I think it is plausible to say that the big Christmas present in Brazil next year will likely be a 5G smartphone,” Wilson Cardoso, Nokia’s chief technology officer in Latin America, said in an interview on Monday. Brazilian telecoms regulator Anatel is still determining the rules for the auction after deciding in May that both 2.3 GHz and 3.5 GHz frequencies would be allocated to 5G. Other bands such as 26 GHz and 700 MHz, which support ultra-reliable and low latency communications suitable for industrial use, could also be added to the same auction scheduled for March 2020, according to the agency. If all four are auctioned together, Cardoso added, it will be the world’s largest spectrum auction for 5G. “The crown jewels are certainly 26GHz and 700MHz, but the more spectrum available the lower the price speculation among the carriers,” he explained. Nokia started testing 5G technology in Brazil in February 2018 with TIM Participacoes SA, the local subsidiary of Telecom Italia SpA. Cardoso said the Finnish company has also conducted tests with other carriers, but refused to name them as the projects are confidential. Like Sweden’s Ericsson and China’s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, Nokia is also collaborating with Anatel ahead of the expected auction, he added. Asked if spying concerns raised by U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration against rival Huawei benefited Nokia’s businesses in Brazil or elsewhere, Cardoso said the Finnish company is “taking advantage of all opportunities.” “We are the Western alternative to Huawei’s products and their direct competitor, as our end-to-end portfolios are quite compatible,” he said. Nokia has signed 45 commercial contracts in 30 countries to provide equipment for 5G networks, the company said in an email, noting that networks are already operating under 10 of the contracts. Last year, it invested over 20% of its revenue in research and development, including 5G."
-33.02854826444723," Nokia beats forecasts as 5G sales start to kick in HELSINKI (Reuters) - Finnish telecom network equipment maker Nokia posted a surprise jump in second-quarter profit on Thursday and stuck to its 2019 earnings outlook as demand for next-generation 5G equipment boosted results. Despite what the company called a slow start to 2019 and an overall weak first half, it expects a strong fourth quarter as customer demand for 5G kit increases. Shares in the company jumped 6.8% in initial trading. “Demand is strong in lead 5G markets, US and Korea,” CEO Rajeev Suri told a conference call, adding the market for new technology would start this year in Japan, the Middle East, China, the Nordics, Italy and the United Kingdom. Nokia said it now has 45 commercial 5G deals and 9 live networks but also echoed comments from rival Ericsson on increasing competition as companies look to grab share in the early roll out of 5G. Last week, Ericsson shares fell sharply after it warned a battle for new contracts to hit profit margins in the second half of the year. Nokia counts Sweden’s Ericsson and China’s Huawei as its main rivals, and some analysts say the Nordic companies may benefit from challenges faced by Huawei after Washington alleged its equipment could be used by Beijing for spying - charges Huawei denies. Security concerns are causing some customers to re-evaluate their vendors, piling near-term pressure to invest in order to secure long-term benefits, the company added. The telecoms equipment maker also said trade-related uncertainty and challenges in the Chinese market mean the company would keep a close eye on spending to deliver on a previously-announced 700 million euro savings program. “Given these risks, we will continue to focus on tight operational discipline,” Suri said. Nokia reported April-June underlying earnings per share of 0.05 euros, compared with an average forecast of 0.03 euros in a Refinitiv poll. The company said its second-quarter revenue rose 7% from a year ago to 5.69 billion euros ($6.34 billion), boosted by growth in North America. The equipment maker’s quarterly revenue beat analysts’ average forecast of 5.43 billion euros. Analyst Alexander Peterc of Societe Generale said the results well-above expectations showed the company was rebounding after a weak first quarter. “We’re still at a low point but their recovery is much quicker than people were modeling,” said Peterc, who has a buy recommendation on the stock. “It’s a kind of contrast with Ericsson so there might be some switching from Ericsson to Nokia on the back of this as well.” Nokia maintained its forecasts of full-year earnings per share at 0.25-0.29 euros, and 2020 EPS of 0.37-0.42 euros. Analysts’ average forecast stands at 0.23 euros for 2019 and 0.36 euros for 2020, according to Refinitiv data.

With 42 commercial 5G orders, Nokia has edged ahead of Huawei and Ericsson, Nokia director Federico Guillen said, as the companies jostle for position in a market in which U.S.-driven security concerns over Chinese equipment have boosted the attraction of Nordic vendors. Huawei has struck an estimated 40 commercial 5G orders. Swedish rival Ericsson has publicly announced 19 contracts, of which eight are live. Customers are increasingly looking to Nokia to equip their next-generation core networks, either to have dual sourcing for the most sensitive parts of their networks or to replace existing providers, Guillen said. “It’s a little early to quantify that, but in recent weeks we are starting to see that happening,” Guillen, president of customer operations, told Reuters. Guillen said there has been particular interest from European countries that have been debating the role of Chinese vendors in their networks. “Where we are starting to see traction is in countries where there are debates,” Guillen said. Nokia said 22 of its 5G deals are with named customers such as T-Mobile, Telia and Softbank. It has won 12 new 5G orders since late March."

-1.4157855368541608," Finnish IoT company Uros' sales soar 171% last year: report HELSINKI (Reuters) - Finland’s Uros, a little known Internet of Things services company, saw its sales soar 171% to 1.31 billion euros last year and could become Finland’s next tech star after Nokia, Finnish business weekly Talouselama reported on Wednesday. Uros, a privately owned company based in Oulu, sells mobile connections for industrial devices and sensors and sees more rapid growth ahead from a Qualcomm partnership, Chief Executive Jerry Raatikainen told Talouselama in an interview. “IoT (Internet of Things) is a bigger phenomenon than Nokia’s phones at the start of 2000. This could become anything,” Raatikainen said, adding his company intended to maintain its growth rate into 2022. Finland’s Nokia was the world’s No. 1 mobile phone maker until 2012. After failing to respond to rapid growth in demand for smart phones, the company remade itself into a network equipment maker. Despite rapid growth, Uros’ businesses have proved highly profitable. In 2018, Uros made a profit of 120 million euros ($134 million), up 845% from a year before. Uros has also developed an integrated e-sim technology adopted by mobile phone manufacturers such as Motorola and China’s ZTE that allows phone users to subscribe to services of several different operators simultaneously. Raatikainen said the world’s leading chip manufacturer, Qualcomm Technologies, has taken on Uros as a partner in its smart cities accelerator program alongside U.S.-based technology firms such as Verizon Communications to develop smart street lights, parking solutions and connected devices. “We are the only European company there. Getting in has opened doors for us and will phenomenally increase business in many industrial sectors,” Raatikainen said.

3.5114196921566356," Nokia CEO sees possible benefits from Huawei tensions HELSINKI (Reuters) - Nokia Chief Executive Rajeev Suri said on Tuesday the company could benefit from a U.S. clampdown on Chinese rival Huawei as the race to roll out 5G services heats up. Asked about the regulatory problems facing Huawei, he told investors: “Perhaps there is long term opportunity but more than that, it’s hard to say at this point.” Analysts expect Nokia and its Swedish peer Ericsson to benefit from tensions between the United States and Huawei, the largest supplier of mobile network technology. Nokia last month reported a surprise quarterly loss after it failed to supply 5G telecoms equipment in time. Suri acknowledged the company had been a little slow in getting 5G technology up and running, citing merging its own technology plans with those of acquired Alcatel-Lucent as a reason. “We are late in 5G by a few weeks to a couple of months,” Suri told the Finnish company’s annual shareholder meeting. Nokia said it has won one additional commercial 5G contract since it reported first quarter earnings in late April. “We are winning deals and rolling out some of the world’s first 5G networks,” Suri said. “We now have 37 5G commercial contracts - 20 with named customers including T-Mobile, AT&T, STC, and Telia - and more than half of them include wider portfolio elements that our competitors cannot match,” he added. Suri told investors he remained confident the company would reach its annual financial guidance.

8.741185314824085," Nokia plunges to surprise quarterly loss, shares hit six-month low HELSINKI (Reuters) - Finland’s Nokia plunged to a surprise quarterly loss after it failed to supply 5G telecoms equipment in time, and said the security dispute surrounding rival Huawei was creating pressure to invest as customers reassess their suppliers. Shares fell 9 percent to 4.68 euros on the news on Thursday, their lowest level in six months. Nokia said it would be under significant pressure to deliver in the second half after a slow start to the year in supplying next-generation mobile gear. Nokia counts Sweden’s Ericsson and China’s Huawei as its main rivals, and some analysts say the Finnish company may benefit from challenges faced by Huawei after Washington alleged its equipment could be used by Beijing for spying - charges Huawei denies. Ericsson last week posted January-March quarter profit that beat forecasts, spurring the Swedish firm to lift its outlook for the global telecom networks market. But Nokia said on Thursday: “Some customers are reassessing their vendors in light of security concerns, creating near-term pressure to invest in order to secure long-term benefits.” Nokia said a failure to book about 200 million euros ($222 million) of net sales related to 5G in North America weighed on its first-quarter results. It expects to recognize the amount during the full year. The company’s core networks business generated a loss of 254 million euros during the quarter, compared with a gain of 46 million in the year-ago quarter, as its investments into 5G are yet to generate profits. Investors and analysts said different speeds of rollout of 5G product offering, and a different set of customers could explain why Nokia has had a rockier start to 2019 than Ericsson. “Huawei’s unclear situation has turned negative for Nokia in the short term, even though it should be more of an opportunity in the longer term,” said analyst Mikael Rautanen of equity research firm Inderes, referring to operators postponing their investment decisions. “It looks like Nokia has not upgraded its product offering fully to 5G yet. They explain it with external reasons like standards, but there have to be also internal factors,” he said. Nokia, which signaled in January that it would have a particularly weak first quarter, made an operating loss (non-IFRS) of 59 million euros, compared with a profit of 239 million euros in the year-ago quarter. That compared with analysts’ profit expectations ranging from 175 million to 457 million euros profit in a Reuters poll. The telecom networks industry has faced slowing demand since 4G network sales peaked in the middle of the decade, and is betting on a new cycle of network upgrades to 5G. Nokia -- which said it had won 36 commercial 5G deals so far -- repeated its January forecasts for a “flattish” market in 2019, and for its 2019 earnings per share of 0.25-0.29 euros, and 2020 EPS of 0.37-0.42 euros."

Among the biggest drags was Finnish telecom network equipment maker Nokia which slid 10 percent after the company reported a surprise quarterly loss citing hard competition in its core networks business. Nokia shares dragged the tech index lower after its 4 percent surge in prior session. Switzerland’s biggest bank UBS advanced after its first-quarter results surpassed analyst expectations. This follows a surprise profit from its smaller rival Credit Suisse on Wednesday. Britain’s Barclays slipped after reporting a 10 percent drop in the quarterly profit, as tough market conditions caused a drop in earnings at its under-pressure investment bank. Swedbank fell 3 percent after posting an estimate-beating first-quarter profit but the Swedish lender admitted to previous shortcomings in combating money laundering. The banking index shed 0.6 percent broadly as Germany’s benchmark 10-year government bond yield held below zero percent, a day after a disappointing German Ifo sentiment survey exacerbated growth concerns in the region. Sainsbury’s slipped 6 percent after Britain’s competition regulator blocked the retailer’s proposed 7.3 billion pound ($9.4 billion) takeover of Walmart owned Asda. On the other end of the index, heavyweight Bayer rose after the drug and farming supplies company posted a 45 percent gain in quarterly core earnings on the back of seed maker Monsanto’s acquisition.

-10.355891609811753," Continental, Valeo seek EU antitrust action against Nokia BRUSSELS (Reuters) - German car parts maker Continental and French rival Valeo have joined Daimler and Bury Technologies to seek an EU antitrust investigation into Nokia’s patent licensing practices for cars, the Finnish tech company said on Wednesday. Last month, German carmaker Daimler and Bury complained to the European Commission about Nokia’s patents essential to car communications. The complaint highlights ongoing disputes between tech companies and the car industry on royalties paid on technologies used in navigation systems, vehicle-to-vehicle communication and self-driving cars. Nokia was notified of the Bury, Continental and Valeo complaints at the same time that the Commission told the company of Daimler’s complaint, a Nokia spokesman said. The EU competition enforcer confirmed Continental’s complaint and said it was assessing this as well as those from Daimler and Bury. “The reason for this complaint is that we believe Nokia is not exercising fair practices regarding the licensing of their alleged standard essential patents,” Continental said in a statement. Companies with key patents are expected to offer these on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. Valeo confirmed filing an EU complaint on the basis of abuse of a dominant position by Nokia. Nokia, which has a highly lucrative portfolio of patents inherited from the time when it was a leading mobile phone maker, said it had started talks with carmakers and their primary suppliers in 2015 on the use of its patents."

While companies with key patents are expected to offer these on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms, the lack of clear rules on calculating license fees and terms inevitably lead to disputes when companies fail to agree on the charges. Bury, a family-owned company with production plants in Germany, Poland and Mexico, said it had filed a complaint to the European Commission. “Nokia refuses to license mobile components. Instead, Nokia insists on indirect licensing of the entire vehicle,” Bury said in a statement. “Nokia does not own a vehicle-oriented standard essential patent. Therefore, Nokia cannot demand indirect licensing of the entire vehicle,” it said. Nokia, which has a highly lucrative portfolio of patents dating from the time when it was a leading mobile phone maker, said it had started talks with carmakers and their primary suppliers in 2015. “Nothing in Bury’s complaint changes our view on the matter,” it said in a statement. The company’s policy is to agree on licenses that cover internet connected cars and not the individual component. The Commission confirmed receipt of Bury’s complaint and said it would assess it."

Tech companies and mobile telecoms providers are playing an increasingly important role in the auto industry, with their technologies used in navigation systems, vehicle-to-vehicle communication and self-driving cars. Daimler confirmed that it had lodged a complaint with the European Commission against Nokia. “We want clarification on how essential patents for telecommunications standards are to be licensed in the automotive industry,” the car maker said in a statement on Saturday. “Fair and non-discriminatory access to these standards for all users of the essential patents for telecommunications standards is a key prerequisite for the development of new products and services for connected driving.” The European Commission confirmed receipt of Daimler’s complaint. Nokia said Daimler was seeking to side-step taking out licenses. “Though we offer a wide range of options for automakers, including through their tier 1 suppliers, Daimler has resisted taking a license to the Nokia inventions it is already using,” Nokia spokesman Mark Durrant said. “Daimler’s allegations in its complaint to the EU are simply the latest in a long series of actions to avoid taking a license,” he said. Nokia has a highly profitable patent business, a legacy of its history as the market-leading mobile phone maker.

Huawei has strongly rejected the allegations and launched a lawsuit against the U.S. government. “What we see is that customers are worried,” Ericsson Chief Executive Borje Ekholm told Reuters ahead of the firm’s annual meeting at a venue close to its north Stockholm headquarters. “And that of course leads to more discussions with customers for us, but we can’t see that contracts are being allocated. That has not happened yet.” EU nations will be required to share data on 5G cybersecurity risks and produce measures to tackle them by the end of the year, the European Commission said on Tuesday, shunning U.S. calls to ban Huawei across the bloc. “It’s good that the EU is trying to harmonize the regulations...they are trying to create some kind of umbrella, which I think is very good for Europe,” Ekholm said, adding that Ericsson will not take a position on national security issues. Ericsson won back a 5G customer from Huawei in its own backyard last week when it signed a comprehensive deal with Denmark’s TDC to deploy its 5G platform and modernize the carrier’s radio access and core networks. Huawei had signed a six-year networks deal with TDC back in 2013, establishing the Danish company as a ‘reference’ customer to showcase its performance. TDC CEO Allison Kirkby was quoted as saying that the operator “is not blind” to widespread concerns about Huawei and information security, although she also pointed out that price was a significant factor. Ericsson said it had won the contract because it is a technology leader in 5G. “This is an important customer, we will be working with their whole network... and we see that as a strategically important cooperation,” Ekholm said, but added the deal had been on the table for “a few years”."

A1 Group, which is controlled by Mexico’s America Movil and the Austrian state, said Nokia would provide it with 5G wireless technology and cloud-based core network technology. 5G will deliver super-fast connectivity and facilitate new applications from self-driving cars to medical robots. The selection of suppliers for the new networks has become a politically sensitive issue after the United States lobbied Europe to shut out China’s Huawei, saying its equipment could be used by Beijing for espionage. Huawei has strongly rejected the allegations and this month sued the U.S. government over the matter. The European Commission will urge EU countries to share more data to tackle cybersecurity risks related to 5G networks but will not call for a Huawei ban, sources have told Reuters. Nokia and Sweden’s Ericsson are the leading European contenders to provide 5G equipment. “Together with Nokia, we will leverage the full potential of 5G,” said A1 Austria Chief Executive Marcus Grausam. “We rely on a trusted and long-standing partner with whom we have already successfully implemented numerous major projects.” A1 Group agreed to pay 64.3 million euros ($72.8 million) for spectrum in the 3.5 Ghz band in Austria’s first 5G auction earlier this month.

The Finnish network equipment maker flagged the issue in its annual report which was released late on Thursday to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Nokia said it had launched an investigation into certain transactions of the business it bought in 2016. After the shares dropped more than 8 percent in Europe on Friday, Nokia issued a statement saying it did not think the issues would have any material impact on the group. “We believe it is highly likely that any penalties that might apply would be limited and immaterial,” Nokia said. The shares pared some of the earlier losses to be down 5.4 percent at 1545 GMT. In its annual report Nokia said certain practices at the former Alcatel-Lucent business had raised its concerns during the integration process and it had informed relevant regulatory authorities, without elaborating. Nokia told Reuters on Friday it was scrutinizing certain transactions and its investigation was at a relatively early stage. The telecoms sector has seen a number of relatively large deals in recent years: Nokia itself bought Siemens out from their mobile networks’ joint venture in 2013, and Alcatel-Lucent was a result of a 2006 merger. However, integrating acquisition targets has been cumbersome -- those deals have been plagued by difficulties including trying to cut costs in an R&D intensive business, rivals stealing contracts, and struggles over power."

Under the nuclear deal struck between Iran and six big powers in 2015, sanctions imposed by the United States, European Union and United Nations were lifted in return for Iran agreeing long-term curbs on a nuclear program the West suspected was geared to developing an atom bomb. U.S. President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the agreement last year, and new U.S. sanctions have largely succeeded in persuading European companies to put aside business projects with Iran. “As a European company it will be quite challenging to reconcile the opposing foreign policy regimes of the U.S. and the EU,” Nokia said. Nokia made a total of 54.6 million euros ($62 million) in sales to operators in Iran in 2018. “Although we evaluate our business activities on an ongoing basis, we currently do not intend to accept any new business in Iran in 2019 and intend to only complete existing contractual obligations in Iran in compliance with applicable economic sanctions and other trade-related laws,” it said."
-16.656765595817742," Finland to investigate Nokia-branded phones after data breach report HELSINKI (Reuters) - Finland’s data protection ombudsman said on Thursday he would investigate whether Nokia-branded phones had breached data rules after a report said the handsets sent information to China. Nokia-branded mobile phones are developed under license by Finnish company HMD Global, which said no personal data had been shared with a third party although it said there had been a data software glitch with one batch of handsets that had been fixed. Ombudsman Reijo Aarnio told Reuters he would assess whether there were any breaches that involved “personal information and if there has been a legal justification for this.” Norwegian public broadcaster NRK reported on Thursday a data breach related to the Nokia 7 Plus model, built by HMD. It said the company had “admitted that an unspecified number of Nokia 7 Plus phones had sent data to the Chinese server.” Nokia, which receives royalties from HMD but has no direct investment in the firm, declined to comment. U.S. accusations that Chinese telecom giant Huawei posed an espionage risk has heightened Western government security concerns. Huawei, which competes with Nokia in the network business, denies it poses any such risk. NRK said it was alerted to the data issue after a Nokia 7 Plus user contacted them to say his phone often contacted a particular server, sending data packages in an unencrypted format. NRK said HMD had declined to say who owned the server. “We can confirm that no personally identifiable information has been shared with any third party,” HMD Global said in an email to Reuters, adding there had been “an error in software packaging process in a single batch of one device model”. “Such data was never processed and no person could have been identified based on this data,” HDM said, adding the error had been fixed in February and that nearly all affected devices had installed the fix. Nokia, once the world’s dominant cellphone maker but which struggled to keep up with the shift to smartphones, sold all its handset activities and is now focused on telecom network equipment. The handset business was initially sold to Microsoft in 2014. HMD, set up by former Nokia executives, took over the Nokia feature phone business from Microsoft in 2016 and struck a deal with Nokia Oyj to use the brand on smartphones."

The company was showing it could innovate by delivering the world’s first five-camera array system in a smartphone, Chief Executive Florian Seiche said in an interview. It also refreshed its devices in the mid-market, where it already has a top-five ranking in many markets, and introduced a feature phone - the Nokia 210 - able to connect to the Internet using an Opera Mini browser, priced at an average $35. Seiche said the Nokia range would serve users, particularly in emerging markets, from feature phone to mid-market devices. He said the mid-market Nokia 3.2 and Nokia 4.2 also appealed to users who wanted good value combined with the simplicity of a “pure” Android operating system, unencumbered with software installed by the device maker and with guaranteed upgrades. “People tend to keep their smartphones longer,” Seiche said. “People start thinking maybe for half the price I can get an experience just as good, and even lasts for a lifetime on our phone.” Analyst Frank Gillett at Forrester said the high-end photo features of the Nokia 9 PureView - including two 12 megapixel color sensors and three 12 megapixel monochrome sensors - plus a full range of phones and features at affordable prices, positioned Nokia to appeal to the hundreds of millions of smartphone buyers set to come online in India and China. “The Nokia models won’t contend for leadership with Apple, Huawei and Samsung - but that’s not their goal,” he added. The Nokia 9 PureView will be available from March at an average price of $699, and both the Nokia 3.2 and 4.2 will be available in April, from $139 and $169 respectively, he said."
-15.823681595079595," Nokia says 5G would not be delayed by ban on Chinese suppliers BARCELONA (Reuters) - Nokia does not expect the possible exclusion of Chinese companies on security grounds to delay the rollout of next-generation 5G services in European markets, CEO Rajeev Suri told Reuters. Debate is raging in Europe over whether to heed calls from Washington to bar China’s Huawei Technologies, even as big telecoms operators warn that such a move could set back the deployment of 5G by years. Suri, however, downplayed concerns that a reduced field of vendors could slow network upgrades. The real reasons for Europe’s growing 5G lag behind the United States are hold-ups in issuing spectrum to operators, as well as high auction costs in countries such as Italy, he said. “I think you cannot say that you know the situation caused by some of this will delay 5G rollout or that others are not capable or ready to provide equipment. That would not be accurate,” Suri said on the sidelines of the Mobile World Congress , the industry’s main annual gathering, in Barcelona. U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration has lobbied European allies aggressively to shut out Huawei, saying the company is too closely tied to the Chinese government and its equipment could be vulnerable to cyber espionage. Huawei strongly rejects those allegations and Chairman Guo Ping, speaking in Barcelona, reiterated that it would never allow any country to insert so-called back doors in its equipment. Nokia, the second-biggest networks player behind Huawei, has warned of a weak start to 2019 but expects sales to recover and show growth in 2020 as 5G deployment accelerates. The Finnish company announced a key win in Australia, which has banned Huawei, saying it would provide a 5G fixed-wireless access network to operator Optus, with 50 sites to go live by March. In a first, Nokia will provide to a limited number of Optus customers super-fast wireless internet that can support several devices and at the same time deliver ultra-high-definition video to the home, the two companies said. Nokia also said it had agreed with Korea Telecom to conduct 5G trials for service automation, network virtualisation and slicing, which allows multiple networks to run on top of shared infrastructure. There are also plans for Nokia to cooperate with Britain’s Vodafone on active antennas to boost 5G capacity and cut costs, plus an agreement with India’s Bharti Airtel to conduct a trial of a so-called front-haul solution that will help to speed 5G operations. The rapid rollout of 5G depends on whether antitrust regulators allow telecoms markets to consolidate, said Suri, adding that this would create stronger players capable of shouldering the vast investment needed to overhaul and upgrade networks. This applied both to Europe and to the United States, where the $26 billion takeover by T-Mobile of Sprint Corp is being reviewed by regulators. Waving that deal through would be positive for 5G, Suri told a later news conference. “If you want to accelerate 5G, that merger does allow the possibility to do so, simply with the spectrum and the economics,” he told reporters and analysts."

The outlook eclipsed fourth-quarter results that beat profit and sales expectations. “We expect 2019 to have a soft first half followed by a much more robust second half,” CEO Rajeev Suri said in a statement. The Finnish firm said it expected 5G mobile networks to fuel gains over the next two years. Nokia shares were down 5.6 percent at 0825 GMT, on track for their worst day since Oct 2017. “There was a bit more uncertainty in the outlook than I was expecting but the big picture is still the same. The market is recovering well with 5G and they’re heading toward their 2020 targets,” said analyst Mikael Rautanen at research firm Inderes, which holds an accumulate recommendation on Nokia. “Overall it was a quite good Q4 as expected.” The networks industry has faced slowing demand since 4G network sales peaked in the middle of the decade but a new cycle of network upgrades appear to be kicking in as demand for 5G services increases. Last week, Ericsson beat fourth-quarter profit margin and sales forecasts, citing cost cuts and demand from U.S. mobile operators for 5G telecoms equipment. Nokia counts Chinese market leader Huawei and Sweden’s Ericsson as its main rivals. Some analysts think it might benefit from challenges faced by Huawei after Washington alleged its equipment could be used by Beijing for spying. Suri declined to comment specifically on how the fallout from the Huawei case might impact its business, saying only that the company was monitoring the situation. Nokia reported a fourth-quarter operating profit (non-IFRS) up 12 percent to 1.12 billion euros which beat analysts’ forecasts helped by its software and enterprise businesses. Gains in the software business -- which Nokia said it plans to start reporting separately this quarter -- also underpinned the strong fourth quarter. The company forecast 2019 earnings per share of 0.25-0.29 euros, above analysts’ estimates. It also forecast 2020 EPS of 0.37-0.42 euros. Company executives on a conference call said more than 70 5G trials were under way and that business was strong in the United States, its biggest market. “We had a strong 2018 in North America as we had been indicating throughout the year,” Chief Financial Officer Kristian Pullola said. “That’s the lead market where 5G is starting to happen and Nokia has been delivering on that promise.”"

The company's shares rose about 6 percent in Toronto and on the New York Stock Exchange BB.N. Chief Executive Officer John Chen has steered the company into high-growth segments such as selling software used in mobiles, and more recently supplying technology to companies developing driverless cars, since losing out to Apple Inc's AAPL.O iPhones and Android devices in the smartphone market. BlackBerry’s QNX software allows carmakers to offer a range of features such as infotainment, connectivity, advanced driver assistance system and over-the-air software update platform. “We are winning a lot of autonomous design, the platform design, especially with the chipmakers like Qualcomm, Nvidia, NXP and Broadcom,” Chen told Reuters, adding he expects the company’s software to show up in any future autonomous platforms that these chipmakers are associated with. The company's current customers for the software include Ford Motor Co F.N, Jaguar Land Rover [TAMOJL.UL], Baidu Inc BIDU.O and Aptiv Plc APTV.N.

1.824211120597727," Japan's SoftBank to shun Huawei in favor of Ericsson, Nokia equipment: Nikkei TOKYO (Reuters) - SoftBank Group Corp plans to replace 4G network equipment from China’s Huawei Technologies Co Ltd with hardware from Nokia and Ericsson, Nikkei reported on Thursday, without citing sources. The move comes at a time of heightened scrutiny of Chinese tech firms by the United States and some prominent allies over ties to the Chinese government, driven by concerns they could be used by Beijing for spying. SoftBank, Japan’s third-largest telco, will also order equipment for its next generation 5G network from the two European suppliers instead of Huawei, Nikkei reported. A SoftBank spokesman said the report was “based on speculation and no decision has been made”. Nokia and Ericsson are already big suppliers to SoftBank. It also has the longest running relationship with Huawei among Japan’s top three telcos, but the firm has previously said that the amount of equipment it uses from Chinese makers “is relatively small”. Replacing the 4G equipment, which Nikkei reported will be done over several years, is likely to be time-consuming and expensive, industry sources have said. The Nikkei report on the supplier switch comes as SoftBank is preparing to list its telecoms unit in Tokyo on Dec. 19. This week, SoftBank’s telecoms unit priced its IPO at an indicated 1,500 yen ($13.22) per share and said would sell an extra 160 million shares to meet demand, raising about $23.5 billion in Japan’s biggest-ever IPO. The report also comes on the heels of Japan issuing a policy document on maintaining cybersecurity during procurement. While Huawei was not explicitly named, sources have said that the policy document was aimed at preventing government procurement from the company as well as China’s ZTE Corp. Huawei has already been locked out of the U.S. market, and Australia and New Zealand have blocked it from building 5G networks amid concerns of its possible links with China’s government. Huawei has said Beijing has no influence over it. Japan’s decision to keep Huawei out would add to the woes of the firm, whose chief financial officer was recently arrested by Canadian officials for extradition to the United States."

Marc Rouanne, Nokia’s head of mobile networks will be replaced by Tommi Uitto, a Finn described by the company as an “expert in radio technologies”. Frenchman Rouanne is the second senior executive to leave Nokia within the past few weeks after the head of its patent business, Ilkka Rahnasto, resigned at the beginning of last month. Nokia plans to merge the mobile networks and fixed networks business groups into a new unit called Access Networks which will have a president, who is yet to be named. Mobile networks accounts for around 30 percent of Nokia’s revenue. Under Rouanne, it had been in charge of developing and selling new 5G technologies in which operators are only beginning to invest. “By creating a single Access Networks organization that includes both fixed and mobile, we can improve our customer focus, simplify our management structure, and more efficiently leverage our full portfolio,” Chief Executive Rajeev Suri said in a statement. Uitto has been leading mobile networks product sales since Nokia acquired its Franco-American rival Alcatel-Lucent in 2016 for 15.6 billion euros. Rouanne joined Nokia from Alcatel-Lucent back in 2008. The company’s share price was down around 1.7 percent at 0910 GMT.

The networks industry - dominated by Nokia, Sweden’s Ericsson and China’s Huawei [HWT.UL] - has been battered by years of slowing demand for existing 4G networks and mounting investor doubts over whether 5G contracts can begin to boost profitability this year. The Finnish firm, which also reported a drop in quarterly profit, said it was targeting annual cost savings of 700 million euros ($799 million) by the end of 2020, without elaborating on the scale of expected job reductions. It is yet to complete its previous 1.2 billion euro cost cuts, launched after its 2016 acquisition of Franco-American Alcatel-Lucent. “We are making progress but still have more work to do get our network margins where we would like them to be,” Chief Executive Rajeev Suri told a conference call. He reaffirmed an outlook for Nokia’s networks business to deliver a full-year operating margin of 6-9 percent. The margin for the first nine months is only 2.6 percent. “Despite some risks related to short-term delays in project timing and product deliveries, we remain on track to deliver on our full-year guidance,” he added. As evidence of the 5G cycle taking root, Nokia in July signed a $3.5 billion deal to supply U.S. mobile carrier T-Mobile with new network gear. Nokia’s operating profit in the third quarter fell 27 percent from a year ago to 487 million euros broadly in line with analysts’ mean forecast in a Reuters poll of 492 million euros. The year-ago profit figure was boosted by a catch-up licensing payment. More than half of the earnings were generated by Nokia’s highly profitable patent business, a legacy of Nokia’s history as the market-leading mobile phone maker. Nokia also announced an extension to its patent license deal with Samsung on Thursday. Shares in the company fell 1 percent in early trade. “Networks business sales is growing, which indicates that the market is picking up...

15.809530218598825," Nokia chairman reopens old wounds with new book HELSINKI (Reuters) - Nokia’s chairman has pointed the finger at his predecessor over the mobile phone maker’s fall from grace in a book that has reopened old wounds in Finland, where the company remains a source of national pride. Nokia was the world’s largest mobile handset maker and Europe’s highest valued company at its peak, accounting for about 4 percent of Finland’s economic output. But it failed to recognize the threat to its existence posed by the rise of touchscreen smartphones after Apple launched the iPhone in 2007. It has since sold off its handset business, with thousands of jobs lost along the way, and is now focused on telecoms networks and licensing its technology patents. Nokia’s decline was partly down to a lack of entrepreneurial leadership and the failure to face up to bad news, according to the book by Risto Siilasmaa, Nokia’s chairman, who joined the company’s board in 2008. Named “Transforming Nokia: The power of paranoid optimism to lead through colossal change,” the book has made headlines beyond the business world because of its attacks on former Nokia CEO and Chairman Jorma Ollila. Siilasmaa said Ollila, one of Finland’s best known business leaders who once considered running for president and is also a former chairman of Royal Dutch Shell, was quick-tempered and spread fear in the organization, which curbed open discussion and led to a reluctance to share bad news. Siilasmaa said he proposed Nokia look into choosing Google’s Android platform for Nokia’s smartphones over the company’s own Symbian system in 2009, but a memo he had sent to Ollila was never discussed in the boardroom. “RUINED LEGACY” Siilasmaa said Ollila also sought to prevent his election as chairman in 2012, and yelled at him over phone when he briefed Ollila the following year about the plan to sell the handset business to Microsoft. “Our conversation followed the usual pattern: I tried to be polite; he exploded and yelled that I had ruined his legacy,” Siilasmaa wrote. Ollila, now 68 and retired from frontline business, was Nokia chief executive in the phonemaker’s heyday from 1992 to 2006, a year before the iPhone’s launch, and then served as its chairman until 2012. In Finland’s Helsingin Sanomat daily he said that Siilasmaa, 52, was exaggerating with his accusations and had trouble understanding that running a large global company was different from managing a small company. Siilasmaa is the founder of Finnish cybersecurity and privacy company F-Secure. Under Siilasmaa’s command, Nokia ended up selling the handset business to Microsoft in 2014. Nokia then bought control of a joint venture with Germany’s Siemens and followed up by acquiring Franco-American Alcatel-Lucent, making itself one of the world’s biggest mobile network makers."

2.363640110479208," Nokia, T-Mobile US agree $3.5 billion deal, world's first big 5G award LONDON (Reuters) - T-Mobile US TMUS.O named Nokia NOKIA.HE to supply it with $3.5 billion in next-generation 5G network gear, the firms said on Monday, marking the world's largest 5G deal so far and concrete evidence of a new wireless upgrade cycle taking root. No.3 U.S. mobile carrier T-Mobile - which in April agreed to a merger with Sprint S.N to create a more formidable rival to U.S. telecom giants Verizon VZ.N and AT&T T.N - said the multiyear supply deal with Nokia will deliver the first nationwide 5G services. The T-Mobile award is critical to Finland’s Nokia, whose results have been battered by years of slowing demand for existing 4G networks and mounting investor doubts over whether 5G contracts can begin to boost profitability later this year. 5G networks promise to deliver faster speeds for mobile phone users and make networks more responsive and reliable for the eventual development of new industrial automation, medical monitoring, driverless car and other business uses. But cash-strapped telecom operators around the world have been gun-shy over committing to commercial upgrades of existing networks, with many seeing 5G technology simply as a way to deliver incremental capacity increases instead of new features. Terms of the deal call for Nokia to supply a range of 5G hardware, software and services that will allow T-Mobile to capitalize on licensed airwave to deliver, broad coverage on 600 megahertz spectrum and ultra high-speed capacity on 28 gigahertz airwaves in densely trafficked urban areas, the companies said. Nokia will supply T-Mobile with its AirScale radio access platform along with cloud-connected hardware, software and acceleration services, they said in a statement. The network equipment business, which is led by three big players - China's Huawei HWT.UL, Nokia and Sweden's Ericsson ERICb.ST - has struggled with flagging growth since the current generation of 4G mobile equipment peaked in 2015.

2.363640110479208," UPDATE 1-Nokia, T-Mobile US agree $3.5 bln deal, world's first big 5G award (Adds comments, details on Ericsson, industry and U.S. context) LONDON, July 30 (Reuters) - T-Mobile US named Nokia to supply it with $3.5 billion in next-generation 5G network gear, marking the world’s largest 5G deal so far and solid evidence of a new wireless upgrade cycle starting to take root. T-Mobile, the third biggest U.S. mobile carrier, said on Monday the Nokia deal would help to deliver the first nationwide 5G services in the United States, where T-Mobile in April agreed to a merger with Sprint to create a more formidable rival to U.S. telecom giants Verizon and AT&T. The T-Mobile award is critical to Nokia, whose results have been battered by years of slowing demand for existing 4G networks and mounting investor doubts over whether 5G contracts can begin to boost profitability later this year. “This is our largest 5G deal to date, in fact it’s one of our largest-ever deals,” Phil Twist, Nokia’s global marketing chief said in interview. “This is reinforcing the fact that we see 5G accelerating to market in Q3 and ramping up in Q4.” 5G networks promise to deliver faster speeds for mobile phone users and make networks more responsive and reliable for the eventual development of new industrial automation, medical monitoring, driverless car and other business uses. But cash-strapped telecom operators around the world have been shy of committing to commercial upgrades of existing networks, with many seeing 5G technology simply as a way to deliver incremental capacity increases instead of new features. Terms of the new deal call for Nokia to supply a range of 5G hardware, software and services that will allow T-Mobile to capitalise on licensed airwave to deliver broad coverage on 600 megahertz spectrum and ultra high-speed capacity on 28 gigahertz airwaves in urban areas with dense traffic, the companies said. Customers, however, will not notice a discernible difference in terms of faster speeds or other features until the first 5G-ready smartphones go on sale in early 2019. Even then, full-featured, 5G phones are unlikely to go mainstream until at least 2020 for a mix of technical and economic reasons, analysts said. Nokia said it will supply T-Mobile with its AirScale radio access platform along with cloud-connected hardware, software and acceleration services, the two companies said. T-Mobile said in February it was working both with Nokia and rival network vendor Ericsson of Sweden to build out 5G networks in 30 U.S. cities during 2018. Ericsson was not immediately available to comment on where it stood on finalising its own previously announced plans to deliver 5G networks in New York, Los Angeles and Las Vegas. In first announcing its plans with T-Mobile earlier this year, Nokia had said it was focusing on Dallas and other unnamed “heavily populated areas of the country.” It provided no further details on what cities Monday’s commercial deal might cover. Nokia delivered lower profits in the first two quarters of 2018 but pledged to meet full-year targets as 5G demand begins to take off later this year. The company reiterated its outlook after the T-Mobile deal, saying it was fully calculated into its existing guidance. Nokia traded up 1.3 percent to 4.76 euros on the Helsinki stock exchange. T-Mobile stock rose more modestly on Nasdaq. The network equipment business, led by China’s Huawei , Nokia and Ericsson - has struggled with flagging growth since demand for the current generation of 4G mobile equipment peaked in 2015. Network vendors are counting on rivalry between the four big U.S. mobile carriers to drive initial 5G purchases this year into next. South Korea and Japan are poised to jump in with 5G commercial rollouts in 2019’s first half, followed by the world’s biggest mobile market, China, later next year, with operators in the Middle East to follow from 2020 onwards. T-Mobile and Sprint, are using 5G to win President Donald Trump’s backing for their merger that will reduce the U.S. mobile market from four players to three. They argue the combined company is the United States’ best hope for nationwide 5G services, which, in turn, can help the country to maintain technology leadership over China. T-Mobile has previously projected capital spending on new equipment of around $5 billion for 2018. T-Mobile Chief Technology Officer Neville Ray said in the joint statement that every dollar it is spending from now onward will be on 5G-related equipment.

0.5405385515480181," After profits drop, Nokia counts on 5G boost later in year HELSINKI/LONDON (Reuters) - Telecom network equipment maker Nokia NOKIA.HE posted quarterly earnings below market expectations on Thursday but vowed that business would recover later this year on the back of a next-generation 5G cycle picking up pace in the United States. Shares in the Finnish company fell 8 percent after it said operating profit in the second quarter dropped 42 percent from a year ago to 334 million euros ($392 million), missing the analyst mean forecast of 373 million euros. Four-fifths of its profit came from its small patent licensing division. The networks business, which makes up 88 percent of Nokia sales, had a quarterly operating profit margin of only 1.5 percent, far below the 4.0 percent market consensus. The network equipment business, which is led by three big players - China's Huawei [HWT.UL], Nokia and Sweden's Ericsson ERICb.ST - has struggled with flagging growth since the current generation of 4G mobile equipment peaked in 2015. Nokia provided few details on how much of a recovery it may see in the current third quarter following the weak first half. However, the company reaffirmed its outlook for the full year - to deliver an operating margin of 6-9 percent in its mainstay networks business - saying it saw a pickup, especially in the fourth quarter, typically its strongest period of the year. “The second quarter was a clear disappointment. With such a weak first half of the year, they must improve a lot to meet that full-year guidance,” said Inderes analyst Mikael Rautanen with a “buy” rating on the stock. “They will either follow up with strong results or a profit warning.” Net sales fell 1 percent from a year ago to 5.32 billion euros, excluding the impact of currency fluctuations. Nokia CEO Rajeev Suri said the company was weathering some price pressures in networks, not from competitors but from telecom operators who were funding early 5G equipment purchases out of their existing capital spending budgets. “We believe that the cycle for 5G will begin from Q3,” Suri told reporters on a conference call. “It will be stronger in Q4, especially in North America, given that the relative mix of North America will progressively increase from Q2 to Q3 to Q4,” North America contributed 31 percent of the network unit’s worldwide sales in the quarter, and most of its growth relative to other regions. Suri said Nokia was seeking to cut more costs on top of its target of 1.2 billion euros of annual cost savings, a plan launched after a 15.6 billion euro acquisition of Franco-American rival Alcatel-Lucent in 2016. Shares in the company were down 8.3 percent on the day in Helsinki by 0732 GMT but remain up 19 percent in the year to date as investors’ hopes rise for a new network spending cycle to begin, driven by demand for new 5G networks."

-11.036782616045425," Nokia's profit expected to drop ahead of 5G fillip HELSINKI (Reuters) - Telecom network equipment maker Nokia NOKIA.HE is expected to post another plunge in quarterly profits on Thursday ahead of an anticipated boost later this year from next-generation 5G networks. The industry has struggled since demand for the current generation of 4G mobile equipment peaked in 2015, but the Finnish company has forecast 5G roll-outs will start later this year in the United States, followed in 2019 by renewed buying cycles in Japan and South Korea. “This should be the last weak quarter of this network market cycle,” said Mikael Rautanen, an analyst at research firm Inderes, who has a “buy” rating on the stock. Chief Executive Rajeev Suri is upbeat on the outlook for the second half: “Almost all profit expectations for their network business are based on his words at the moment,” Rautanen said. Shares in the company were boosted last week as Swedish rival Ericsson ERICb.ST posted an unexpected swing to a modest operating profit, citing growing 5G sales in North America. Nokia stock is up 30 percent year-to-date. “Until now, Ericsson was more cautious than Nokia about the outlook, so this is encouraging,” Rautanen said. The average forecast for Nokia’s second quarter operating profit is 373 million euros ($436 million), down 35 percent from a year earlier, according to a Reuters poll of analysts. Profits will suffer from investments it is making to prepare for upcoming 5G business, analysts said. Sales in the network business, which makes around 90 percent of Nokia’s revenue, are seen falling 8.6 percent to 4.5 billion euros. Rautanen said that the U.S. trade ban on Chinese telecom equipment maker ZTE 000063.SZ may offer further help. Due to the ban, ZTE has lost a deal to upgrade radio equipment for Italy's Wind Tre, which will use gear from Ericsson instead, sources said. “Although the ban has been lifted, operators are cautious... it is quite a risk for them if the vendor can’t deliver what is needed, so this should be positive (for Nokia) in the short-term,” he said, referring to possible additional contract wins. The majority of Nokia’s bottom line in the second quarter is expected to come from its highly-profitable patent licensing business, which stems from the times Nokia was the world’s largest handset maker.

-5.414537721145263," Nokia seller HMD looks to smart and feature phones to grow its African business (By Carlos Mureithi) NAIROBI, June 21 (Reuters) - HMD Global, the Finnish company that owns the rights to sell Nokia-branded phones, is targeting growth in both its smartphones and more basic models as it bids to become Africa’s number-one phone brand, its vice president for sub-Saharan Africa said on Thursday. Sub-Saharan Africa is one of the company’s eight global regions with South Africa, Nigeria and Kenya representing its biggest markets, Justin Maier said in an interview. India is the phone’s biggest market globally. “Africa is still a growing market, moving consumers from the feature phone to a smartphone experience, so there are opportunities for us there as a brand,” he said. Feature phones - devices that lie between basic phones and smartphones - remain an important part of the company’s strategy, Maier said. Market share of feature phones in Africa increased from 55 percent in 2016 to 61 percent last year, while that of smartphones fell from 45 percent to 39 percent in the same period, according to the International Data Corporation. HMD Global offers feature phones ranging in price from $18 for the entry-level Nokia 105 to $50 for the premium Nokia 3310 that was relaunched last year, Maier said. He said the need for more price-sensitive and entry-level phones in Africa is important. In sub-Saharan Africa, HMD sells smartphones including the entry-level Nokia 1 that costs $80 and the premium Nokia 7 Plus that costs $470. HMD Global has a distribution partnership model that uses distributors and mobile network operators such as Safaricom for Kenya and MTN for South Africa to sell its phones The company hopes its use of devices that run on “pure” Android, a version of the Google-developed operating system that does not have add-ons and modifications created by phone makers for their specific gadgets, will prove popular with consumers. HMD Global wants to be the number-one phone brand in Africa in five years, Maier said. “We see that opportunity,” he said. The company’s challenge, Maier said, is ensuring that consumers know Nokia phones now run the Android operating system rather than the previous Symbian system. According to Counterpoint Research, Nokia was the best-selling brand in low-cost feature phones globally last year and ranked 11th in smartphone sales. In February, HMD Global reported it had sold 70 million handsets globally in 2017, its first full year of business, generating sales of $2.1 billion. Maier did not disclose how many phones they sold in Africa. HMD, set up by former Nokia executives, took over the Nokia feature phone business from Microsoft in 2016 and struck a deal with Nokia Oyj to use the brand on smartphones. It pays Nokia Corp royalties for the brand and patents, but Nokia has no direct investment in HMD. (Reporting by Carlos Mureithi; Editing by Omar Mohammed and Jan Harvey)"
-4.145080004606406," Nokia sells digital health venture, executive to leave HELSINKI (Reuters) - Nokia said on Thursday it had sold its small digital health business, including activity trackers and smartwatches, and the executive who wound down the company’s consumer ventures will leave Nokia after less than a year in the job. Digital health was one of the areas the Finnish company had been counting on for future growth opportunities amid a tough market for its mainstay telecom network equipment business. But Gregory Lee, a former Samsung executive who took the helm of Nokia’s Technologies unit last year, pulled Nokia away from the business as well as a virtual camera venture, leaving the unit to focus on patent and brand licensing. The health business was sold to Eric Carreel, co-founder and former chairman of the operation, for an undisclosed price. Nokia had announced plans to sell the business earlier this month. “Gregory came to Nokia... and took the bold decision to refocus Nokia Technologies on licensing... We have agreed that his work at Nokia is done,” Nokia CEO Rajeev Suri said in a statement. Chief Legal Officer Maria Varsellona will take over the Technologies unit, Nokia said. The licensing business, highly profitable, includes royalties from handset vendors for the use of Nokia’s brand and smartphone patents. As an initial move into the health market, Nokia in 2016 bought France’s Withings for 170 million euros ($199 million). An internal memo from February showed that the business failed to meet Nokia’s growth expectations. Nokia has not given exact sales figures for the business, but digital health and virtual camera products in total generated 52 million euros of sales last year, compared to Nokia’s total revenue of 23.2 billion euros."

-1.560005469572778," Nokia sees weak first half but strong momentum later in 2018 HELSINKI/LONDON (Reuters) - Nokia posted a big drop in profits at its mainstay network equipment business as operators, particularly in North America held off spending, but it sees momentum building later in 2018 as the market for next-generation 5G networks takes off. The Finnish company reported operating profits at its network business tumbled 87 percent, and said that the business would likely remain soft during the current quarter. “We expect an atypical seasonal trend, with softness in the first half of the year, offset by a very dynamic second half,” Chief Executive Rajeev Suri told reporters following the report. “We are confident we can outperform a strengthening (network) market and meet our full year guidance,” he added. Its shares recovered to end down less than 1 percent on the day after falling almost 9 percent earlier. “Nokia’s Q1 results were much weaker than expected. ..but management confidence has increased on full year outlook,” UBS said in a research report. It recommends clients buy the stock. Nokia’s CEO said the battered industry would bounce back as large-scale commercial roll-outs of 5G networks start to kick in later this year in North America and 5G build-outs in 2019 in China, Japan, South Korea, the Nordics and the Middle East. “Although there are some skeptics, we see 5G coming fast and coming big,” Suri told reporters. The industry, including Sweden’s Ericsson and China’s Huawei [HWT.UL] and ZTE has struggled for years after demand for the current generation of 4G mobile broadband equipment peaked. He added that a U.S. ban on exports to China’s ZTE over alleged Iran sanctions violations could play to Nokia’s long-term advantage, while adding that it was too early to evaluate the impact. Reports on Wednesday that the U.S. could level similar sanctions on Huawei over Iran could be a boon for Western network suppliers such as Nokia, analysts said. On Thursday, Nokia forecast the global network market to fall 1-3 percent this year, a slight improvement from its previous forecast of a fall of 2-4 percent, and added its own sales would outperform the wider telecom equipment market. “We are at the very bottom of the pothole, right between technology cycles,” said Mikael Rautanen, analyst at Inderes Equity Research, with a ‘buy’ rating on the stock. Rautanen said Nokia looked better positioned to benefit from the 5G era than arch-rival Ericsson, thanks to the Finnish firm’s 2016 acquisition of Alcatel-Lucent, which broadened its portfolio to include both mobile and fixed-line network gear. Loss-making Ericsson has been going through broad restructuring and last week stirred recovery hopes by beating market expectations on the back of cost savings. “Nokia has an important competitive advantage as we’re going to 5G, but it remains to be seen how it will be realized,” Rautanen said. Nokia’s first-quarter group earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) fell 30 percent from a year ago to 239 million euros ($291 million), well below analysts’ average forecast of 369 million euros in a Reuters poll. Net sales in North America declined 15 percent in constant currency terms, excluding currency effects, while China fell 9 percent. Latin America, by contrast, jumped 48 percent, while Middle East, Africa and Europe grew by lesser percentages. While the networks business made up 88 percent of Nokia’s sales, a clear majority of the bottom line was generated in its highly-profitable patent licensing business. Nokia has recently struck licensing deals with all major handset makers including Apple, Huawei, Samsung Electronics, LG and Xiaomi. Nokia’s patent portfolio stems from when it was the world’s largest handset maker in previous decades. It failed to compete in touchscreen smartphones and sold the phone business to Microsoft in 2014, leaving it with the networks and patents. Lately, Nokia struck a licensing deal with a new company HMD Global, which has brought the Nokia brand back to the smartphone market. ($1 = 0.8214 euros)"

6.437435150250821," ZTE woes may boost network rivals Ericsson and Nokia STOCKHOLM/LONDON (Reuters) - Investors are warming to beleaguered mobile network makers Ericsson and Nokia as they begin to recover ahead of a once-a-decade uplift from a new business cycle and an unexpected boost from a U.S. ban on exports to low-cost Chinese rival ZTE. ZTE has snatched market share in Europe and the Americas, growing four times faster in those markets last year than it did its home market and acting as a drag on contract pricing and revenue growth for Ericsson and Nokia. But now, ZTE has been slapped with a potentially devastating seven-year export ban. It has yet to say how it may respond to U.S. threats to cut off its supply chain. Ericsson is due to report results on Friday and Nokia next Thursday and the focus is likely to be on next-generation 5G network upgrades expected to start later in 2018 or during 2019, ending a three-to-four year dry spell in network spending. ZTE, meanwhile, has postponed its own quarterly results announcement, which was due on Thursday. Ericsson shares are up 3 percent in April while Nokia has gained 6 percent. Bengt Nordstrom, head of telecoms consultancy Northstream, said it could take several months for ZTE to find alternative suppliers and redesign its products, including optical and mobile gear. “This is a very serious setback for ZTE,” he said. Whether or not a Commerce Department ban on U.S. firms supplying components to ZTE holds up, Ericsson and Nokia still face a tough year ahead amid weak overall market demand as telecom operators keep a tight lid on network capital spending. Three big players dominate the global market for mobile network gear: Huawei, of China, is the biggest, followed closely by Ericsson and Nokia. Complicating the picture is that Huawei [HWT.UL] and Nokia have more revenue from serving other telecom segments. The three face competition from ZTE and Korean electronics giant Samsung Electronics, a relative newcomer to the network gear market, and a growing number of more focused software and services challengers. Quarterly financial reports for the European names are likely to deliver only muted signs of recovery, even if prospects seem to be brightening further out. “No one on this planet is ready to break the bank for 5G, even less so with a total lack of 5G business cases,” IHS Markit mobile equipment analyst Stephane Teral told Reuters. Even when 5G hits its stride sometime next decade, he warns that capital spending may never return to 4G peak levels of 2015. Revenue for Europe’s two big network gear suppliers remains under pressure in 2018, even if they are making progress towards seeing growth stabilize in 2019, analysts at UBS said, adding this is “more so for Nokia than Ericsson, where there remains much work to be done to rationalize contracts”. Sweden’s Ericsson has made sweeping cost cuts, changed most of its management and is focusing on profitability over growth. Ericsson has spied signs of recovery in a few key markets but cautions that it has more work to do in order to hit profit improvement targets it has pledged to deliver by 2020. A Reuters poll shows that analysts, on average, expect sales to fall 9 percent in the first quarter, with its main networks business declining 11 percent. Nokia has said it expects its results to bottom this year, and has forecast a recovery in profits by 2020, encouraging investors spooked last year by the general decline in global network spending and acquisition integration missteps. Most analysts see Nokia recovering faster than Ericsson, which, in a nutshell, is why Nokia shares are up 22 percent so far this year, while Ericsson is up just 1 percent, after the latest in a string of downbeat quarterly reports in January. Northern Trust analyst Gary Paulin considers Nokia an especially safe bet in a volatile tech market, classifying it as a “fallen angel” - a cheap stock that has suffered a round of setbacks but is on the mend, ready to demonstrate its underlying earnings power once its short-term issues resolve. By contrast, Credit Suisse says stock market expectations are still too high for Ericsson, which it says will underperform the market due to execution risks from its ongoing restructuring and slower than expected benefits from 5G adoption. Activist investor Cevian Capital said it is betting on Ericsson to improve profits by increasing efficiency and simplifying how it operates, rather than counting on any 5G boost later this decade. “When 5G comes it could lift growth and profitability further,” said Christer Gardell, managing partner at Cevian Capital which owned 8.5 percent of Ericsson outstanding shares as of February."
