12.208504801097389," U.S. private prison revenue under pressure from new Biden rules NEW YORK (Reuters) - CoreCivic and the GEO Group, two of the largest U.S. private prison companies, could lose as much as a quarter of their revenue, about $1 billion a year between them, under new limits on the sector from President Joe Biden. Shares in GEO Group and CoreCivic took a hit on Tuesday after Biden signed an executive order to roll back the U.S. government’s use of private prisons, a part of what he called an initiative to tackle systemic racism. Tuesday’s action left both stocks near their lowest levels in more than a decade. Both had recovered some of those losses on Wednesday morning, but remained near decade lows. Biden’s current order applies to the Justice Department’s federal contracts with private prisons, which would include facilities used by the Bureau of Prisons and U.S. Marshals Service, though the order did not specifically name those agencies. At GEO Group, U.S. Marshals and Bureau of Prisons accounted for 23% of total revenue in 2019, or about $570 million. In 2019, CoreCivic earned 5% of its total revenue from its federal contracts with the Bureau of Prisons and 17% from the U.S. Marshals, or a total of about $440 million. The largest customer in 2019 of both companies was U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), accounting for 29% of CoreCivic’s business and 22% of GEO Group’s. The order does not apply to the Department of Homeland Security and therefore not to ICE facilities. In response to requests for comments, both CoreCivic and GEO Group said the executive order would not mean big changes for their businesses. “The (Bureau of Prisons) has experienced a steady decline in inmate populations over the past several years, so (Tuesday’s) announcement was no surprise,” said a CoreCivic representative. A representative from GEO Group said the Bureau of Prisons had already announced steps over the past four months to not renew expiring contracts because of declining federal prison populations, in part due to the coronavirus pandemic. “Given the steps the BOP had already announced, yesterday’s executive order merely represents a political statement,” he said. Shares of GEO and CoreCivic had already been walloped in the past year as COVID-19 restrictions at the U.S.-Mexico border and capacity restrictions for health reasons kept facilities they operate for ICE well below capacity. Both stocks have fallen more than 80% since the early days of Donald Trump’s presidency, when his hardline immigration policies filled ICE facilities with detained immigrants. “(The new order is) not a positive for GEO Group or CoreCivic, but it also doesn’t blow up the business model,” said Joe Gomes, senior research analyst at Noble Capital Markets. Although the use of private prisons increased under Trump, activist and investor pressure had prompted some big Wall Street institutions to pull their support from the industry well before Biden’s order. In 2019, JPMorgan, Bank of America and SunTrust - which had underwritten bonds or syndicated loans for CoreCivic and GEO Group - said they would stop financing private prison operations. Neither prison company has raised money in public markets since 2019 and Biden’s new order could increase credit risks, making it harder for either company to refinance debt. GEO Group has a $250 million debt note due in January 2022, and CoreCivic has a $250 million note due in October 2022. Both companies carry speculative-grade - or junk - ratings from Moody’s and S&P, in part because their revenue is so susceptible to changes in government policy and public scrutiny of companies profiting from detention."

28.951255539143293," Ban on forced labor applies to immigrant detention centers: 5th Circuit A divided U.S. appeals court panel on Wednesday said a federal law prohibiting forced labor applies to immigrant detention centers, rejecting private prison operator CoreCivic Inc’s claim that federal regulations allow it to pay detainees as little as $1 per day to cook, clean and perform other tasks. The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in a 2-1 decision said the Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Act of 2000 (TVPA), which prohibits providing and obtaining labor through threats, force or restraint, was designed to apply broadly and not only in the context of international human trafficking as Tennessee-based CoreCivic had claimed.

-2.465213537577648," Investor activists press U.S. prison operators on human rights BOSTON (Reuters) - Activist investors said on Tuesday they filed shareholder resolutions at two U.S. private prison operators, looking to link executive pay to human rights considerations at CoreCivic Inc and have Geo Group give more details on the treatment of people held at correction and detention facilities. The resolutions were filed by shareholders including the Service Employees International Union and the Jesuits U.S.A. West Province. Both resemble resolutions filed elsewhere, including at banks with financial ties to border security contractors at a time when U.S. President Donald Trump has pursued stricter immigration enforcement. “We thought it was critical to send these companies a message that they need to be concerned about the risks they could be potentially facing around human rights,” said Nadira Narine, senior program director at the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, an organizer of the efforts. The group’s members including religious and labor investors in recent years have passed resolutions on topics like gun control and climate change, showing how political issues increasingly have drawn shareholder attention. A spokeswoman for CoreCivic, Amanda Gilchrist, said the company is reviewing the proposal. “CoreCivic has a detailed Human Rights Policy that clearly outlines our commitments regarding resident rights and treatment, including legal rights, safety and security, healthcare, reentry programming, visitation and standards of living,” she said. In a statement e-mailed by Geo Group spokesman Pablo Paez, the company said it “has always been committed to respecting the human rights of all those entrusted to our care” and that processing centers it runs on behalf of the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency “provide safe and humane environments that meet the needs of individuals in the care of federal immigration authorities.” Shares of both companies rose after Trump was elected in November 2016, but have been under pressure amid questions about oversight. In November the board of the California State Teachers’ Retirement System voted to sell shares in the two companies. Both companies say they do not house children separated from their families, a policy the Trump administration once pursued. The resolution at CoreCivic calls for its compensation committee “to incorporate respect for inmate and detainee human rights” into incentive pay arrangements for senior executives. The resolution at GEO Group calls for it to report annually on how it has implemented and measured its human rights policy."
6.848099617154961," Prison shares rise as U.S. eyes more migrant family detention space (Reuters) - Shares in private prison operators CoreCivic Inc and Geo Group rose on Friday as investors bet on increasing demand for their services after U.S. authorities asked about available capacity for the detention of immigrant families. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s office of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) issued a request for information on Friday afternoon about potential facilities from different providers to accommodate up to 15,000 beds, ideally in several locations. The move came after U.S. President Donald Trump issued an executive order on Wednesday aimed at ending his controversial policy of separating immigrant children from their parents caught entering the country illegally. Under the order, which is likely to be challenged in court, families will now be detained together for the duration of their criminal and immigration proceedings. The latter can take months or even years to complete. Shares in CoreCivic closed up 3.95 percent at $23.39, a nearly five-month high, in an unusually active trading day on Friday. The stock has jumped 11.2 percent in the last four days. Rival Geo, which has gained 6.6 percent since Trump’s executive order was issued, closed up 1.6 percent at $26.48, in a fifth straight day of gains. The Oklahoma Board of Corrections is due to meet on Tuesday to discuss approval of a contract with Geo for its Lawton Correctional Facility, according to a notice on its website, With ICE potentially looking for more beds, states are likely feeling pressure to accelerate such contract decisions said Jamie Cuellar, portfolio manager for Buffalo Funds in Mission, Kansas. “It’s more and more demand that continues to get snapped up, so states will be forced to get off the sidelines and get capacity under contract before it goes elsewhere,” he said. Immigrant families are currently housed in facilities in Pennsylvania and Texas that have a total capacity of about 3,300 beds and are now at 79 percent capacity, according to ICE. The U.S. military has been asked to prepare to house up to 20,000 immigrant children. Trading volume in CoreCivic shares was more than three times the 10-day moving average on Friday. Geo trading volume was 1.7 times the 10-day moving average. Geo and CoreCivic were not immediately available for comment."

19.501201314813528," Prison operator shares rise on Trump immigration executive order NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of prison operators CoreCivic Inc and Geo Group Inc jumped on Wednesday on investor speculation that they could benefit from an executive order signed by U.S. President Donald Trump to end the separation of immigrant children from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border. The order requires immigrant families to be detained together when they are caught entering the United States from Mexico illegally, for as long as their criminal proceedings take. It also moves parents with children to the front of the line for immigration proceedings. CoreCivic shares ended up 3.5 percent, their largest one-day percentage gain since April 3. Geo Group shares rose 1.8 percent, their biggest one-day percentage gain since May 3. The administration must determine where to house families that are detained together, possibly for long periods, and how to reunite families that already have been separated. The executive order could increase the need for capacity at U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) family detention centers, said Jamie Cuellar, co-portfolio manager of the Buffalo Small Cap Fund, which owns CoreCivic shares. That greater need could bring more business to both prison operators, which operate ICE family detention centers. “This means another growth opportunity, more funding for more beds, and they’d provide programing they’d be offering to kids in detention and they’d get paid for it,” said Cuellar, who is based in Mission, Kansas. Services for children, such as education and play spaces, would bring in additional revenue, Cuellar said. None of Geo Group’s facilities have housed unaccompanied children, Pablo Paez, the company’s executive vice-president of corporate relations, wrote in an email to Reuters. Reuters was unable to reach CoreCivic for comment. CoreCivic said in a statement earlier on Wednesday that its facilities do not house children who have been separated from their parents. “It’s important to note that, under long-standing policy, CoreCivic does not advocate for or against legislation or policies that determine the basis for or duration of an individual’s detention,” CoreCivic’s statement read. “We also do not enforce immigration laws or policies or have any say whatsoever in an individual’s deportation or release.”"
