50.816866434049324," Genesis Energy expects up to $50 million in losses due to storms: CEO NEW YORK (Reuters) - Genesis Energy LP GEL.N said it expects to lose as much as $50 million this year due to a battery of storms that hit the U.S. Gulf of Mexico and forced lengthy offshore oil and gas production shut-ins, Chief Executive Grant Sims told investors on Thursday. In a typical year, storms would cost the company about $8 to $10 million, he said. The Houston offshore pipeline operator’s oil and gas pipeline volumes fell as hurricanes Marco and Laura tore through the central Gulf of Mexico region and halted roughly two weeks of production in the three months ended Sept. 30, Sims said. Hurricanes Delta and Zeta caused another 15 days of disruption to Genesis Energy’s pipeline systems in the current quarter, adding to expenses, Sims said. Genesis is still working to get its 380-mile (610-km) Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline System (CHOPS) back to normal after the hurricanes caused structural damage to a platform within the system. Crude oil shipped on CHOPS, which is delivered to the Texas coast and sold as Southern Green Canyon WTM-SGC, is being rerouted and delivered into the Poseidon pipeline system or the Auger pipeline, while the damage is investigated. Genesis Energy’s quarterly revenues were $443.1 million in the three months ended Sept. 30, compared to $621.7 million for the same period last year."
57.50610971487998," Genesis Energy oil pipeline unlikely to be restored before October NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. Gulf of Mexico crude oil pipeline owned by Genesis Energy LP is not expected to be fully restored before Oct. 1, the company said on Thursday, after destructive storms tore through the coastal region late last month. Houston-based Genesis is working to get its 380-mile (610-km) Cameron Highway Oil Pipeline System (CHOPS) up and running again weeks after Hurricane Laura and a lesser storm passed through the area and forced mass production shut-ins. Crude oil shipped on the CHOPS, which is delivered to the Texas coast and sold as Southern Green Canyon, is being rerouted and delivered into the Poseidon pipeline system or the Auger pipeline, a company spokesperson said in an email. “Based upon continuing data collection, analysis and physical tasks required to be undertaken, it would appear that CHOPS is unlikely to resume normal operations before Oct. 1,” the company said in a notice to shippers on Wednesday. Argus first reported the production delay. The pipeline itself was not damaged but a platform in the system was affected by the storms, the company said."

-3.5400566132711226," UPDATE 1-Genesis Energy expects negative impact to Q3 earnings from hurricane - CEO (Adds net income, share price, fourth quarter flow rates) HOUSTON, Aug 6 (Reuters) - Genesis Energy LP expects its third-quarter earnings will be negatively impacted following a longer-than-expected delay in restarting U.S. Gulf of Mexico production in the wake of Hurricane Barry, which swept through the region last month, Chief Executive Grant Sims told investors on Tuesday. The Gulf fully restored oil and gas production about nine days after the storm passed, instead of an expected four days, which lowered volumes on Genesis’ pipeline systems. A third-party internet connectivity provider experienced issues restarting service in the region, Sims said. Genesis reported net income of 17 cents per unit in the second quarter, compared with a 5 cent loss in the same period last year. Shares were down about 5 cents at $21.17 in early trading on Tuesday. The Houston offshore pipeline operator’s Gulf volumes are expected to return to normal in the fourth quarter, benefiting from the start of oil output at LLOG Exploration’s deep-water Buckskin project, which will have a peak flow rate of 30,000 barrels per day (bpd), Sims said.
