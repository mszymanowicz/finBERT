-8.974358974358971," Why U.S. energy CEOs will get big payouts despite oil meltdown BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - National Oilwell Varco Inc (NOV) has had a rough few years: Since 2017, the Houston company, whose drilling equipment is in major oilfields worldwide, has lost two-thirds of its value, costing shareholders a combined $9 billion. Despite that performance, Chief Executive Clay Williams pocketed $3.3 million in stock in late February, solely because his company’s total shareholder return over the three years ending in 2019 was not as bad as most of his beleaguered peers. U.S. energy executives have retained such lavish payouts even as they have struggled for years to deliver shareholder returns - despite massive growth in domestic shale oil production. Now executives’ compensation is being insulated from the pain of the worst energy crisis in four decades, caused by the coronavirus pandemic. Stay-at-home orders to fight the virus have crushed demand for fossil fuels worldwide, forcing companies to cut thousands of jobs, slash billions in capital spending and, in some cases, fight for survival. On Thursday, NOV suspended its dividend to conserve cash. Company spokesman Blake McCarthy said NOV has recently worked to make executive pay terms more “shareholder friendly,” including a new cap on payouts for negative returns, which the company disclosed in an April filing. Williams and his peers, however, are in line for another round of big payouts. CEOs at energy companies in the Standard & Poor’s 500 index are sitting on $140 million in performance-based share grants made in 2019 that are scheduled to vest in 2021 and 2022, according to a Reuters review of their latest pay disclosures. The reason? Energy companies, more than any other sector, measure performance only against other companies in the same industry, who tend to suffer at similar times. They use a metric called relative total shareholder return (TSR) and benchmark it against a pre-determined group of peer companies - making it possible for executives to get big payouts even if their companies’ stocks lose value. That system means the heavy shareholder losses expected this year will likely not translate to big reductions in CEO stock awards because the pandemic hit all oil companies in roughly equal measure. With relative TSR as a key component of pay packages, energy company CEOs have been winning for losing for at least a decade. Investors, meanwhile, have just been losing. The total return of the S&P 500 Energy Index .SPNY is 1% over the past decade, as of May 26, a period when the broader S&P 500’s total return rose by 243%. Slightly more than one-third of S&P 500 companies benchmark relative TSR against a broad index of firms. No energy companies do, according to compensation research firm Exequity LLP. Some of the worst performers in the energy sector recently awarded executives multi-million dollar payments as motivation to stay put and manage through the downturn. Chesapeake Energy Corp CHK.N, for example, handed out $25 million in cash bonuses to executives just before it disclosed in May that it was considering bankruptcy. Chesapeake did not respond to requests for comment. Ben Dell, managing partner at investment firm Kimmeridge, said oil and gas firms are telling investors to be grateful the system works because, in some cases, CEOs are not getting 100% of their performance-based payouts. “The abuse has been going on for years,” said Dell, a critic of excessive executive compensation whose firm buys stakes in underperforming energy companies to push for change. He said investors would benefit from reforms in CEO pay structures, but that the barriers to change are high because investors generally put little pressure on companies to rein in executive pay. In proxy votes, investors overwhelmingly approve CEO pay packages in all sectors of the U.S. economy, including energy, regardless of stock performance. Average say-on-pay support in the energy sector was 90% in 2019, according to research firm Semler Brossy Consulting Group LLC. At NOV’s May 20 annual meeting, executive compensation received more than 90% support from shareholders. Exequity senior advisor Ben Burney, a leading expert on relative TSR, said it is fair for energy firms to judge their executives through comparisons to peers with similar business models. The volatility of energy prices makes broader comparisons more difficult, he said. “If you are at the top of the group, you get more. If you’re at the bottom of the group you get less,” Burney said. “You don’t have to reset goals with the ebb and flow of energy prices.” More than 90% of the largest U.S. oil and gas companies use relative TSR to calculate long-term stock incentives for senior executives, Burney said. Across the S&P 500, 60% of companies use relative TSR. The use of relative TSR has helped top executives at the 15 largest oil and gas producers receive more than $2 billion in reported compensation in the last decade, said Doug Terreson, an energy analyst at Evercore ISI. For example, Devon Energy Corp DVN.N CEO David Hager received $1.3 million in stock at the end of January as a reward for total shareholder returns falling by 41% over three years. That was good enough for an 11th place finish among its 15-company peer group, Devon disclosed in its proxy. Hager received only 60% of his target grant because Devon’s TSR was below median performance in the peer group. The previous year, he received no TSR-related payout because Devon ranked 13th out of 15 peers. A spokesman for Devon declined to comment. Over the past three years, Williams of NOV has been paid about $13 million on average annually. In February, he received shares equivalent to 200% of his original 2017 stock grant because the company’s relative TSR – a 32% decline in shareholder returns – was in the top quartile of the peer group. The company’s board of directors increased the number of shares it granted Williams in 2019 to keep his compensation high even as the stock lost value, another common tactic by energy firms over the past three years, according to company filings. NOV’s new cap limits CEOs to collecting 100% of their targeted stock grants if the company posts a negative three-year total return, regardless of how it stacks up against peer firms, according to the company’s April proxy filing. That rule did not apply to Williams’ payout in February. Many investors have lost patience with the poor returns of energy firms. Shale oil companies helped make the United States the world’s largest producer of oil and gas, but that hasn’t translated to bottom-line growth. Since the end of 2016, the market capitalization of the S&P 500 Energy Index .SPNY has fallen to about $725 billion, down 46%, according to data from financial information provider Refinitiv. Large-capitalization growth mutual funds, such as Fidelity's $100 billion-plus Contrafund FCNTX.O, have largely avoided energy stocks. Those left investing in energy are primarily passively managed index funds and smaller investment firms that typically do not have the same capacity to scrutinize executive compensation, nor the reputational heft to influence entrenched boards and management teams. Some investors are starting to push back, however. They are telling energy companies to include the S&P 500 index in their benchmark peer group. Burney said at least 42% of energy companies have agreed to cap awards if they have negative returns. Shawn Reynolds, a natural resources portfolio manager at asset manager VanEck, said paying executives based on relative performance – and rewarding negative returns – gives them a warped definition of success. “Executive compensation has to reflect the experience of the long-term shareholder,” he said. “You can’t expect to lose 20% of your stock price and get paid just because the industry loses 30%.”"
-48.6798845675551," National Oilwell Varco warns virus fallout could hit supply chain (Reuters) - U.S. oilfield equipment supplier National Oilwell Varco NOV.N on Friday called the coronavirus a ""wildcard"" in the oil industry's outlook, with an extended outbreak potentially hurting access to Chinese-make materials and foreign sales. The Houston-based company said further shutdowns at its Chinese suppliers could limit its production of certain products such as fiberglass resins and drilling pipe. For now, National Oilwell has the latitude to make up lost ground, executives added, noting it has a diversified supply chain. “[There is] still a lot of uncertainty related to the extent to which this will impact operations,” Jose Bayardo, chief finance officer, said on an earnings call with investors. China also is a growing market for its products, he said. Chief Executive Clay Williams added that he was equally concerned about the virus’ impact on global oil demand, which could affect its oil and gas customers. National Oilwell is one of the largest suppliers of oil drilling equipment. An outbreak of the coronavirus in China has roiled commodity markets in recent weeks. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies are weighing additional output cuts as demand for crude oil falls. U.S. crude futures were trading around $50.46 a barrel on Friday, on track for their fifth consecutive weekly decline. Shares of National Oilwell were up 11% on Friday afternoon after it beat analysts forecasts for quarterly earnings. “National Oilwell Varco has done a masterful job of controlling what it can control,” analysts for Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co wrote in a note on Friday, pointing to cost savings and working capital efficiencies."
-48.6798845675551," National Oilwell Varco profit beats estimates as cost cuts pay off (Reuters) - National Oilwell Varco NOV.N beat estimates for its fourth-quarter profit on Thursday, as the oilfield services provider cut costs to counter an ongoing decline in North American drilling activity. Lower crude prices and investor demand for higher returns have forced U.S. oil and gas companies to hold off on drilling, hurting earnings of companies that provide drilling and fracking services. The company took charges of $537 million in impairment and restructuring in the quarter due to declines in U.S. drilling activity and its measures to cut costs. Larger rivals Halliburton Co HAL.N and Schlumberger NV SLB.N have also undertaken cost-cutting efforts by laying off workforce and putting up assets for sale to boost earnings in a tough market. “The fourth quarter saw continued improvements in international and offshore markets, partially offset by another sequential decline in spending by our customers in North America,” CEO Clay Williams said in a statement. Net attributable loss to the company was $385 million, or $1.01 per share for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, compared with a profit of $12 million, or 3 cents per share, a year earlier. On an adjusted basis, National Oilwell Varco earned $1 per share, beating Refinitiv IBES analysts’ estimates of $0.16. Its revenue fell 5% to $2.28 billion, but beat estimates of $2.11 billion. The company's peer Patterson-UTI Energy Inc PTEN.O reported a bigger-than-expected quarterly loss earlier in the day."

-5.704938283537122," Oilfield service firm National Oilwell trims staff amid industry slump (Reuters) - U.S. oilfield supplier National Oilwell Varco Inc NOV.N is trimming its workforce, according to people familiar with the matter, as oil and gas customers have cut spending on services and equipment. The company recently began offering voluntary early retirement to eligible employees, three people said. Any discussion of workforce cuts would be part of its second-quarter earnings call next week, said a spokesman for the Houston-based company, who declined to comment further. Although global oil prices have rebounded from the market’s 2014-16 downturn, profits at the service companies that provide drilling and well-completion services have not recovered to the same extent. An index of oilfield service firms’ operating margins fell to a negative 32.8 from negative 6.6 in the bank’s earlier survey. Halliburton HAL.N, the largest provider of hydraulic fracturing services in the United States, this week said it would cut 8% of its workforce in North America. The largest oilfield services provider by revenue, Schlumberger NV SLB.N, this month said it expects softer demand for services in North America. National Oilwell Varco provides equipment and other services to the oil industry. It had roughly 35,000 employees at the end of 2018, up from about 32,000 a year earlier, according to regulatory filings. Its shares were up less than 1% at $22.01 on Wednesday."
