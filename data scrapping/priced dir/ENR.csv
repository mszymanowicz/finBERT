2.954166071273806," Duracell, Energizer end lawsuits over battery life claims NEW YORK (Reuters) - The makers of Energizer and Duracell batteries have ended two lawsuits accusing each other of advertising false claims to consumers about battery life. According to filings on Friday in Manhattan federal court, Energizer Holdings Inc and Duracell, the battery unit of Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc, agreed to voluntarily dismiss competing lawsuits filed there. Energizer sued Duracell in Sept. 2019 over claims the then-new “Optimum” batteries were more powerful and lasted longer than rival batteries. Duracell sued Energizer a year later, challenging claims that the latter’s MAX batteries lasted up to 50% longer than “basic” alkaline batteries. Both companies sought damages for false advertising under New York law and the federal Lanham Act, as well as halts to any improper advertising. The companies and their lawyers did not immediately respond on Monday to requests for comment. Duracell said it recently held a 45% share of the U.S. market for alkaline household batteries, while Energizer had a 26% share."
-1.8802450264218205," Warren Buffett's Duracell sues Energizer over battery life claims NEW YORK (Reuters) - Duracell, the battery unit of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc BRKa.N, sued the maker of Energizer batteries on Tuesday, accusing it falsely advertising that its Energizer MAX batteries last up to 50% longer than other alkaline batteries. The lawsuit follows Energizer Holdings Inc's ENR.N own lawsuit last Sept. 30 accusing Duracell of falsely advertising that its then-new ""Optimum"" batteries were more powerful and lasted longer than rival batteries. Duracell filed counterclaims alleging false advertising in that case. It is now accusing Energizer of having “doubled down” by claiming on battery packages, on printed coupons and through in-store advertising that MAX batteries are “up to 50% longer lasting than basic alkaline in demanding devices.” Energizer is attempting “to confuse and mislead consumers regarding the comparative benefits of Energizer’s MAX batteries relative to other alkaline batteries,” including Duracell’s Coppertop batteries, Duracell’s complaint said. Lawyers for Energizer did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Both lawsuits were filed in Manhattan federal court. The companies have sought damages for false advertising under New York law and the federal Lanham Act, as well as halts to any improper advertising. Duracell said it had a 45% share of the U.S. market for alkaline household batteries, while Energizer has a 26% share. Berkshire bought Duracell, which has offices in Bethel, Connecticut, from Procter & Gamble Co PG.N in February 2016. Energizer is based in St. Louis. The latest case is Duracell US Operations Inc v Energizer Brands LLC, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 20-07318."
-8.452643752119718," Varta gains conditional EU okay to buy Energizer's assets BRUSSELS, Dec 3 (Reuters) - German battery maker Varta secured EU antitrust approval on Tuesday to buy U.S rival Energizer’s Varta branded consumer batteries business after pledging to supply its products to wholesalers globally. Energizer announced the deal in May to address the European Commission’s concerns about its $1.25 billion bid for U.S. consumer products company Spectrum’s global auto care business last year. The EU competition enforcer said it had been concerned that the Varta deal might shut out rivals or lead to price hikes, prompting the company to offer concessions. “In order to address these concerns, Varta AG proposed to globally supply hearing aid batteries to any company currently or potentially active in the wholesale supply of hearing aid batteries under their own brand under certain conditions for a set period of time,” the Commission said.

15.975166831213977," Energizer sues Warren Buffett's Duracell over 'Optimum' battery claims NEW YORK (Reuters) - The maker of Energizer batteries sued the maker of Duracell batteries on Monday, accusing Duracell of duping consumers by implying that its new “Optimum” AA and AAA batteries are more powerful and last longer than all rival batteries. Energizer Holdings Inc ENR.N said Duracell, a unit of Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc BRKa.N, engaged in false advertising for Optimum with packaging that said its batteries offer ""extra life"" and ""extra power,"" and TV commercials that said: ""Both is better than not both."" It is only in the “mice-type” fine print, according to Energizer, that battery buyers learn that Optimum may outperform Duracell’s own Coppertop batteries, not rival batteries, and only in some devices. “These paltry and sporadic benefits are not the stuff great ads are made of and, indeed, barely seem worth touting at all,” Energizer said in its complaint in Manhattan federal court. The St. Louis-based company is seeking damages for false advertising under New York law and the federal Lanham Act, and a halt to any improper advertising. Duracell did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Berkshire bought Duracell, which has offices in Chicago and Bethel, Connecticut, from Procter & Gamble Co PG.N in February 2016. It was not named specifically as a defendant. The lawsuit is not the first Duracell has faced over Optimum, which were launched in July. In August, New Jersey vaping company What A Smoke LLC accused Duracell of infringing its trademark rights in “Optimum” with respect to batteries, battery chargers, liquids and other products associated with electronic cigarettes. That lawsuit was filed in the federal court in Newark, New Jersey. The case is Energizer Brands LLC v Duracell U.S. Operations LLC, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 19-09061."

-10.719452427533046," Energizer adds Armor All, STP brands in $1.25 billion Spectrum deal (Reuters) - Consumer products company Spectrum Brands Holdings Inc SPB.N said on Thursday it would sell its global auto care (GAC) business to battery maker Energizer Holdings Inc ENR.N in a cash-and-stock deal valued at about $1.25 billion. Energizer said the move will bolster its portfolio with well-known autocare brands such as Armor All, STP motor oils and A/C Pro, as it seeks to diversify and reach more retailers. Energizer will pay Spectrum $937.5 million in cash and $312.5 million in stock. Spectrum Auto Care recorded sales of $465 million in the last fiscal year, accounting for nearly 15 percent of Spectrum Brands’ total annual sales. This will be Energizer’s second deal with Spectrum this year. In January, it proposed to buy the consumer company’s battery and portable lighting business for $2 billion - a deal that is still under regulatory review. To speed up the approval process, Energizer proposed on Thursday to allay the European Commission’s concerns over the acquisition, saying it would divest Europe-based Varta consumer battery business that was part of the deal. That move is expected to reduce original deal’s value to between $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion. RBC Capital Markets and Credit Suisse were Spectrum Brands’ financial advisers while Evercore acted as Energizer’s financial adviser for the GAC business deal. Shares of Spectrum Brands, which makes George Foreman cookware and Remington grooming products, were up 5 percent. Energizer was trading down 1.6 pct."
