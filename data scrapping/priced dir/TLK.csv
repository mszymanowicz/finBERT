9.551950248742004," Indonesia's state-backed VC deploys $500 mln fund to help state firms Aug 18 (Reuters) - Indonesia’s MDI Ventures has closed a new $500-million fund designed to invest in startups that can partner with state-owned firms, the venture arm of state-backed telecoms firm Telkom said on Tuesday. The move is part of Indonesia’s strategy to make its telecoms giant more profitable and help modernize state companies in Southeast Asia’s largest economy. “The funds will be used to invest in startups primarily in series B and above that want to strengthen their position in Indonesia,” MDI’s vice-president, Aldi Adrian Hartanto, told Reuters. The firm would assist in such efforts through collaboration with Telkom and other state-owned enterprises, he added. The fund was raised through a commitment by Telkom, or PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia Tbk, which is listed on the New York Stock Exchange as well as in Indonesia, and with the backing of the ministry for state-owned enterprises (SOE). With $790 million in assets, MDI Ventures is one of Southeast Asia’s largest corporate venture capital firms. On Friday, it named Fajrin Rasyid, co-founder of Indonesian online marketplace Bukalapak and the head of Telkom Digital business, as its new chairman.

-11.415406732816592," Founder of Indonesia's Bukalapak to head Telkom's digital business SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Indonesian e-commerce startup Bukalapak said that its co-founder and president Fajrin Rasyid 34 has stepped down to become the head of digital business at state-owned PT Telekomunikasi Indonesia Tbk, (Telkom) TLKM.JK. The move, requested by State-Owned Enterprises Minister Erick Thohir, is part of the former businessman’s strategy to make the country’s telecoms giant more profitable and reduce its dependence on mobile services. However, it leaves Bukalapak without anyone from its founding team, after co-founder and chief executive Achmad Zaky stepped down in January. Bukalapak, valued at more than $2.5 billion during its last fundraising round in October, is backed by Singapore sovereign wealth fund GIC Pte Ltd GIC.UL, China's Ant Financial ANTFIN.UL, and Korea's Shinhan Financial Group Co Ltd 055550.KS. [L3N26P106] The company says it has served 92 million users in Indonesia's fast-growing e-commerce market, which has attracted foreign investors due to surging smartphone use and rising middle class income. But it is trailing Softbank-backed Indonesian company Tokopedia and Tencent-backed regional rival SEA SE.N."

This would be the second fund raising by state-controlled Telkom aimed at startup investments and it will be launched “very soon”, said Budi Gunadi Sadikin, deputy minister of state-owned enterprises, in an industry conference. He said the upcoming fund raising is targeted to be around $300 million to $500 million in size. “This is important because Telkom is an industry with very high capital expenditure with declining EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization) and flattening revenue,” Sadikin said. “We have to move on from only digital infrastructure to digital platform and digital sources.” Telkom had invested in 34 start-up companies in Indonesia and abroad in its first funding round, Sadikin said."
