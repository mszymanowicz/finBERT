-3.4148588901690107," Chipotle's profit misses estimates as COVID-19 costs mount (Reuters) - Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc on Tuesday missed Wall Street estimates for quarterly profit, hurt by costs related to keeping its business running during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the burrito chain’s shares falling nearly 2% in after-hours trading. Strong digital operations at the fast-casual chain, a standout performer in the industry during the coronavirus, have helped it ride out the worst of the impact, even as its expenses have climbed as it bolsters its delivery network. Digital sales rose nearly three-fold and drove a 5.7% rise in comparable sales, helped by a surge in online orders in some parts of the United States. Total revenue increased 11.6% to $1.6 billion for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, the company said. Excluding one-time items, the company earned $3.48 per share, missing the estimate of $3.73, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. “It is now well established that November was weak across the space, and while Chipotle is resilient, it is not immune,” Piper Sandler analysts wrote in a note after earnings report. The company’s share price was up more than 10% so far this year and rose 66% in 2020 - by far the best-performing stock in the restaurant industry, according to Credit Suisse. Its success came partly from its ability to ramp up digital sales quickly during the pandemic. For the full-year 2020, Chipotle’s digital sales grew 174.1% to $2.8 billion and made up 46.2% of sales. About half of digital sales were for delivery orders. The chain is testing quesadillas, as well as smoked brisket, after its January nationwide launch of cilantro-lime cauliflower rice for a limited time. Chipotle has not been providing sales forecasts during the pandemic. However, for 2021 it said it expects to open 200 new restaurants and have an effective tax rate between 25% and 27%. About 70% of its new restaurants will include “Chipotlane” digital drive-thrus. Sales at locations with Chipotlanes are 10 about 10% higher on average than those without, Chief Technology Officer Curt Garner told Reuters in an interview. The company is also testing out “carside” pickup, where an employee brings orders out to a customer’s car, in 29 restaurants. “What we’ve seen so far has been really encouraging,” Garner said."

9.758880201903866," Chipotle to hire 15,000 workers in the United States (Reuters) - Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc said on Monday it would hire 15,000 workers in the United States, as the fast-casual burrito chain benefits from strong demand during the COVID-19 pandemic. The move comes about five months after Chipotle said it planned to add 10,000 more people to its more than 85,000-strong workforce. It now employs about 94,000 people, most of them in the United States. Fast-food chains - mainly pizza and Mexican restaurants - have seen sales remain strong during the pandemic as customers crave comfort food and order in more. Chipotle had posted a 14% jump in revenue in its latest reported quarter. Chipotle in October had said it would open about 200 restaurants. The company had over 2,700 restaurants, as of September. Major pizza chains, including Papa John’s International Inc and Domino’s Pizza Inc, and other big names such as McDonald’s Corp have hired thousands of people in recent months to meet heightened demand even as family-owned restaurants have had to shut shop."
10.025903779373996," Chipotle profit falls on higher coronavirus-related expenses (Reuters) - Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc CMG.N on Wednesday posted an 18.6% drop in quarterly profit, hurt by higher beef prices, delivery costs and coronavirus-related expenses. Shares of the company, one of the best performers in the restaurant sector following a 60% rise this year, fell as much as 6% after the closing bell. Still, the burrito chain reported a three-fold jump in online sales, as consumers ordered more freshly prepared meals and favored to-go orders instead of dining inside restaurants. Comparable sales rose 8.3%, beating Wall Street expectations of a 7.59% rise, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Fast food restaurants - particularly pizza and Mexican restaurants - have seen sales increase amid the pandemic as customers craved comfort food, preferred the contactless nature of delivery, drive-thru and pick-up, and got tired of their own cooking at home. Chipotle’s digital sales could exceed $2.5 billion in 2020, more than double the amount in 2019, Chief Executive Officer Brian Niccol told analysts during a post-earnings conference call. Net income fell 18.6% to $80.2 million for the third quarter. On an adjusted basis, the company earned $3.76 per share, beating estimates of $3.47. Chipotle brought back its popular carne asada option mid-September, helping comparable sales during that period grow in the mid-single digits, Chipotle said, adding that the trend continued through October. The chain charged an extra $1 for its carne asada this year, compared with the 50-cent premium it charged when it launched in 2019 as a limited-time offering, according to Cowen analysts. It also raised menu prices for delivery items. Even so, that was not enough to offset the higher costs of delivery itself, combined with elevated beef prices. The average operating margin per restaurant was 19.5% for the quarter, a decrease from 20.8% from a year earlier, also hurt by fewer sales of beverages. “Between now and next year... if delivery shifts into in-store and shifts into order-ahead and pick-up, then I’d say our margins per share are headed on the way up,” Chief Financial Officer John Hartung told analysts. “If delivery stays the same or increases, we’ll have some challenges,” he said. He also said that labor costs will be around 25% in the fourth quarter as the benefit of menu price increases will be slightly offset by lower seasonal sales."
10.025903779373996," Chipotle's comparable sales beat on online ordering Oct 21 (Reuters) - Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc on Wednesday reported better-than-expected quarterly comparable sales growth, boosted by a surge in online orders from consumers avoiding dining out due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Chipotle, which is represented by Kannon Shanmugam and other lawyers from Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, filed a petition for certiorari on Friday seeking review of an April ruling by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that said more than 500 Chipotle “apprentices” could sue as a collective even though their job duties varied.

9.704119488317106," Chipotle beats quarterly estimates as digital sales more than triple (Reuters) - Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc CMG.N beat Wall Street expectations for second-quarter earnings on Wednesday, as soaring digital sales helped it recover amid the coronavirus crisis and continue the performance that boosted its share price 40% so far this year. Digital sales for the quarter - including customers who order ahead through Chipotle’s mobile app to pick up in special drive-thru “Chipotlanes” - grew 216% to nearly 61% of total sales. Overall comparable sales were 9.8% lower for the quarter ended June 30 but have turned positive, up 6.4% so far in July. In the third quarter, margins and earnings per share will likely remain bumpy, executives said during a conference call. With more Americans staying home due to the coronavirus health crisis, Chipotle has relied heavily on online orders in recent weeks. Shares of the Mexican fast-casual chain, which features bowls and burritos, fell slightly in after-market trading but are still 40% higher year-to-date, closing at $1,185.27 on Wednesday. Chipotle has also partnered with Uber Eats UBER.N and Grubhub Inc GRUB.N to bolster deliveries. Chief Technology Officer Curt Garner said in a phone interview that because Chipotle locations are company owned, it was easier to rethink and build out digital operations, including separate kitchens just for preparing online orders. “Having all of that in place as we came into these unprecedented times gave us the ability to quickly meet the changing customer need,” he said. The company expects to accelerate plans in 2021 to open new locations and now has 15 million people enrolled in its rewards program, up from 11.5 million reported in April. Total revenue fell 4.8% to $1.36 billion, its first decline in at least 14 quarters but still beating Wall Street estimates of $1.34 billion. Excluding one-time items, the fast-casual chain earned 40 cents per share, beating average analysts’ estimates of 35 cents, according to IBES data from Refinitiv."

18.488949107983256," Chipotle plans on hiring 10,000 workers to support drive-thru expansion (Reuters) - Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc CMG.N said on Wednesday it plans to hire as many as 10,000 employees over the next few months to help support the expansion of drive-thru lanes at its restaurants. The COVID-19 pandemic has curtailed dining-in at restaurants across the United States, resulting in a surge in online orders. Chipotle intends to cater to this demand by speeding up plans to add drive-thru lanes at its outlets. The company said 60% of its new restaurants will feature a drive-thru, or “Chipotlane”, where customers can pick-up orders without leaving their cars. The burrito chain’s online sales jumped 80% in the first quarter and demand on the company’s app is not expected to fall any time soon, as virus cases spike in many Southern and Western states. California, Chipotle’s biggest market, rolled back reopening plans on Monday and banned indoor restaurant dining. Chipotle’s hiring blitz comes as the U.S. unemployment rate hovers in double digits, with data last week showing 32.9 million people collected unemployment checks in the third week of June. Other restaurant chains such Domino's Pizza IncDPZ.N and McDonald's Corp MCD.N have also said they would hire thousands more workers."

Overall, same-store sales fell 16% in March as locations were forced to shut dining rooms. While in-store ordering was 75% lower at the start of April, delivery orders rose 150% and mobile pickup orders were 120% higher. For the first quarter, digital sales rose nearly 81% to $371.8 million and accounted for 26.3% of total sales, compared to 19.6% of sales in the fourth quarter. The company is looking to reopen its dining rooms in some areas in coming weeks but expects employees to still wear masks and gloves, offer hand sanitizer and likely have a worker just tasked with sanitizing tables and high-traffic areas, executives said on a call to discuss the quarterly results. “I’m very excited about the opportunity to get our dining rooms reopened,” said Chief Executive Brian Niccol. “I think we’re going to hang on to a lot of our gains, digitally.” He said the company could reopen stores “restaurant by restaurant” as more states start to lift restrictions on business operations enacted to help slow the spread of the virus. The burrito chain partnered with Uber Eats UBER.N in March to increase the number of regions where it can offer deliveries and is adding more drive-thru lanes at restaurants so customers can pick-up online orders without leaving their cars. Separately, the U.S. Department of Justice said on Tuesday Chipotle would pay $25 million to resolve criminal charges related to the company’s involvement in food borne illness outbreaks that sickened hundreds of people between 2015 and 2018. “These payments will unfortunately hurt our liquidity a bit, but we’re ready to put this old matter behind us,” Chief Financial Officer John Hartung said during the call.

Chipotle is securing access to a $500 million line of credit, had $909 million in cash and short-term investments, and no debt as of March 31.

72.9022329765105," Chipotle under pressure in New York over coronavirus sick leave NEW YORK (Reuters) - Less than two months after settling with New York City regulators over paid sick leave, Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc is under pressure for its policies amid the coronavirus pandemic. During a press call on Thursday, the chair of the city council’s health committee joined Chipotle employees and the union organizing them, SEIU 32BJ, to voice concern that the fast-casual chain’s emergency pay policies were not being properly implemented. “We need Chipotle to honor this,” City Councilman Mark Levine, who chairs the city’s Committee on Health, said of paid sick leave. Chipotle, which has 83,000 employees nationwide, sent internal notes to employees, held calls with general managers, posted videos and issued emails notifying them of special sick leave and other coronavirus polices, spokeswoman Erin Wolford said in an email. “Chipotle’s goal is to keep its employees safe and healthy and to keep our communities fed,” she said. “Employees across the country who have called our [nurse hotline] with symptoms, or reported they are being tested, or reported they have come into close contact with someone with COVID-19 are being paid while they are excluded from our restaurants.” Some restaurants have clashed with state and local governments over sick leave policies since well before the coronavirus crisis brought them into even sharper focus. Although New York City and several other cities and states require private employers to provide the benefit, three-fourths of U.S. food service workers do not get it, and major chains, including Dunkin’ Brands Group Inc and Wendy’s Co, offer none, according to the Center for Science in the Public Interest. In a settlement announced Feb. 26, New York City required Chipotle to rehire a worker who was fired when she tried to claim sick leave, and to provide $2,500 in restitution. The city’s investigation of Chipotle continues. The company normally offers 3 days of annual paid sick leave. Alexchayanne Diaz-Larui, 41, called out sick last week with a fever of 101 degrees, he said during the press call. Once he finally got through to Chipotle’s backlogged nurse hotline, he was told to stay home for 7 days. Human resources told him he needed a positive coronavirus test to claim the special sick leave - pay equal to his upcoming 2-week schedule or average hours worked, whichever is greater - despite a well-publicized shortage of test kits. “I was forced to go back to work not knowing if I have it or not,” he said. “I was given the runaround.”"

Since taking over, the former Taco Bell executive has rolled out several new intiatives, including the launch of new campaigns to showcase the quality of food and create more transparency around sourcing.

31.03037730443323," Ackman still likes Chipotle, says sold shares to manage portfolio NEW YORK, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Billionaire investor William Ackman, whose hedge fund earned double-digit returns last year with the help of strong gains in Chipotle Mexican Grill shares, said on Thursday he remained a “delighted long-term shareholder” even after selling some stock. “What started out as a large position recently became a massive one, in excess of 20% of capital,” Ackman told Reuters, adding “We sold stock earlier this week only for portfolio management reasons.” Ackman spoke one day after his Pershing Square Capital Management said in a regulatory filing the firm had cut its stake in the fast food restaurant chain to 4.2% from 5.4%. Pershing Square oversees $7 billion in assets. Investors, however, appeared unnerved by the news. In early trading, Chipotle’s stock price tumbled more than 8% to $777.02 a share. Even though stocks were falling sharply amid fears that companies will be affected by the spread of the coronavirus outbreak that originated in China, some investors worried that Ackman’s move could point to potential problems at Chipotle. Ackman pushed back, saying: “The company continues to generate extraordinary results, and we continue to be a delighted long-term shareholder.” In reference to Chipotle’s chief executive whom he helped install two years ago, he said the company, “under Brian Niccol’s leadership, has performed spectacularly since our initial investment in the company almost four years ago.” During Niccol’s first year on the job, the stock price skyrocketed nearly 200%. Last year, it climbed 94% and was instrumental in helping Pershing Square Holdings, one of Ackman’s portfolios, gain 58.1% year. Ackman, like other managers, has previously trimmed holdings in certain stocks when gains made the positions too large for his portfolio."

CMG.N. Fresh from posting a 58.1% return after fees in 2019, Ackman kicked off 2020 with a portfolio update that also mentioned his latest investment in Agilent Technologies Inc A.N for the first time. He sees a bright future for the testing-equipment company, saying it is currently underleveraged and that there is “substantial opportunity for further improvement.” He and his analysts see more than 800 basis points margin opportunity, far more than the company’s projected 50 to 70 basis points of annual margin expansion over the next few years. Ackman said Agilent is delivering strong performance under the current leadership team and that he paid an average $76.58 per share for the stake. The company’s share price, including dividends, has increased 12% from his average purchase cost in 2019 and is off 2% this year. Agilent was one of two new investments made in 2019. Pershing Square, which now manages $8.5 billion in assets, ranks as one of the industry’s most powerful activist investors where managers push corporations to perform better. Several years ago Ackman opted to take on a lower public profile, prompting investors to closely follow anything he says about his positions publicly. Pershing Square also exited its investment in Starbucks “after prospective returns became more modest following a total shareholder return of 73% in the 19 months that we owned” it. He is sticking with Chipotle, last year’s biggest winner for the firm with a 14.7% return, saying management has a “clear plan to drive continued progress in 2020.” Ackman also reported that David Klafter, a lawyer who had been a member of his investment team, moved to work for Ackman’s family office."

Chipotle also attracted diners through deals for members of its loyalty program and boosted online sales with a drive-thru option - called “Chipotlanes” - for orders placed on its app or website. The company’s steady growth is set to continue in 2020, according to guidance released on Tuesday, as Chief Executive Officer Brian Niccol steers it past the E. coli bacteria outbreaks that sickened customers in 14 states through early 2016. The California-based company expects to deliver mid-single digit percentage growth in comparable restaurant sales this year. It plans to open 150 to 165 new restaurants in 2020, with more than half to include drive-thrus. Part of Niccol’s turnaround success is from digital sales, or orders placed online. “In just three years, we have quadrupled the digital business, achieving over $1 billion in sales during 2019,” he said during a conference call. For the fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, digital sales rose 78.3% and accounted for 19.6% of total sales. Sales from restaurants open for at least 13 months rose 13.4%, beating analysts’ estimate of 9.52%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. New menu items also boosted sales, including carne asada, which launched in September as a temporary ingredient. The premium steak has been so popular that now the company’s supply chain team “is exploring options to see if we can add this as a permanent menu item at some point in the future,” Niccol said. He also hinted at opening up Chipotle’s partnerships with the delivery platforms DoorDash and Postmates to allow more people to access its bowls, burritos and tacos. “When the right opportunity presents itself, we’ll figure out whether we bring on additional players,” he said. “We’re open to it.” Chipotle also plans this year to use database marketing to personalize rewards for the 8.5 million members enrolled in its loyalty program, he said. Excluding one-time items, the company earned $2.86 per share, compared with estimates of $2.75. Revenue rose 17.5% to $1.44 billion, slightly higher than the estimate of $1.40 billion. Net income rose to $72.4 million, or $2.55 per share, from $32.02 million, or $1.15 per share, a year earlier. It estimates it will pay an effective full-year tax rate in 2020 between 26% and 29%."

-32.177395620116144," Chipotle accused of violating U.S. labor law on union organizing (Reuters) - The general counsel of a U.S. labor agency has accused Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc of violating U.S. labor law by allegedly firing an employee in New York in retaliation for complaining about workplace problems and trying to organize with a union. The office of the general counsel of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) filed the complaint on Dec. 12. The union involved, 32BJ, which is trying to organize workers at the Mexican fast-casual restaurant chain, received a copy of the complaint on Thursday. Because Chipotle’s restaurants are all owned by the corporation as a single employer, it is an easier target for union organizers than fast-food giant McDonald’s Corp, most of whose locations are owned and operated by franchisees. Chipotle spokespeople did not provide an immediate response to requests for comment. The NLRB’s general counsel, Peter Robb, alleged in the complaint that a manager at a restaurant in Manhattan in May threatened to fire employees if they engaged in union activities - even implying they might face physical violence - and promised promotions to other workers who provided information about the organizing. The complaint, which was filed with the NLRB, also alleges similar manager intimidation at another Manhattan store. One employee who complained about scheduling and other problems was fired. The complaint asks that Chipotle reimburse the fired employee for expenses incurred from work searches and for tax relief from any lump sum back pay awards. The complaint seeks no other remedy. The NLRB’s general counsel operates independently from the Board and is responsible for investigating and prosecuting unfair labor practices. Robb, who has been general counsel since November 2017, was appointed by President Donald Trump. The parent of 32BJ, the Service Employees International Union, is involved in the Fight for $15 and a Union, which has long sought to organize workers at McDonald’s. That effort suffered a setback of sorts last week when the full NLRB board approved McDonald’s Corp’s proposed settlement allowing the fast-food company to avoid a ruling on whether it is a “joint employer” of franchise workers and could be made to bargain with unions. While Fight for $15 and a Union said it would appeal, the decision suggests it may be a long road for organizers if they are not able to target the parent corporation and must instead bargain with thousands of individual U.S. owners. Chipotle must respond to the complaint by Dec. 26 and a hearing is set for March 2 in New York."
5.788920980756791," Chipotle sales beat expectations on new items, digital ordering NEW YORK (Reuters) - Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc CMG.N reported higher-than-expected quarterly sales on Tuesday, boosted by new menu items and expanded drive-up, delivery and digital ordering options. Comparable sales at stores open for at least 13 months rose 11% in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, beating analysts’ estimate of 9.27%, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Revenue grew 14.6% to $1.4 billion year over year, beating analysts’ expectations for a 12.7% increase to $1.38 billion. Store traffic was 7.5% higher. The Newport Beach, California-based Mexican fast-casual chain also reported adjusted earnings per share of $3.82, a full 60 cents above a mean forecast of $3.22, according to Refinitiv data. Chipotle’s share price has nearly doubled so far this year, even as the restaurant industry has faced pressure from increasing competition. The company has continued to recover from its E. Coli bacteria outbreaks that sickened customers in 14 states through early 2016. Chief Executive Brian Niccol, who was brought on board in February 2018, struck a modest tone about the positive news during a call with investors. “We are still in the early stages of our journey, and we need to stay focused on our priorities,” he said. “I couldn’t be prouder of where we are, but I’m also really excited about where we’re going.” Digital sales - including orders through its app, delivery partners and online - took off, growing nearly 88% in the quarter and accounting for 18.3% of total sales. Net income rose to $98.6 million, or $3.47 per share, from $38.2 million, or $1.36 per share, a year earlier. The company reduced the number of expected new store openings this year, but “only because we are building a really big pipeline for next year,” Niccol said in a phone interview after the earnings call. That is partly because it shifted its real estate strategy to build on the early success of “Chipotlanes,” or drive-thru pick-up lanes for customers that have already placed and paid for an order digitally. About half of the more than 80 new restaurants under construction will include Chipotlanes by the end of 2019. For 2020, the company plans to open another 150 to 165 new locations, with more than half having Chipotlanes. At the end of the quarter, it had 2,546 locations. The company’s new loyalty program, launched in March, has enrolled 7 million members, Niccol said. Traffic, including new customers, was also driven by a new steak menu item called carne asada. Supplies of the limited-time offering will run out by early December. In test markets, “when we removed the carne asada, we saw people continuing to have the Chipotle experience,” Niccol said."

0.5336662728919139," Chipotle faces more labor complaints at New York City stores NEW YORK (Reuters) - Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc is facing fresh claims that it violated New York City’s labor laws after the city sued the fast casual restaurant chain two weeks ago. Employees from five additional stores filed complaints with the city’s Department of Consumer and Worker Protection on Tuesday and walked off their jobs at lunchtime, according to Service Employees International Union 32BJ, the union organizing the workers. The violations make it hard for fast-food workers to plan their lives, 32BJ President Kyle Bragg said in a statement. “When fast food companies violate these provisions, workers lack the advance notice they need to plan other responsibilities such as second jobs, doctors’ appointments or childcare,” he said. On Sept. 10, the city sued Chipotle, accusing it of violating its Fair Workweek Law by failing to provide schedules at least two weeks in advance and failing to pay premiums for last-minute schedule changes, among other claims. The lawsuit stemmed from complaints by more than 30 workers at five Chipotle restaurants in Brooklyn. “Chipotle has been working cooperatively with the city to ensure we have systems and processes in place to comply with the law, so we believe the filing of charges was unnecessary,” Laurie Schalow, Chipotle’s chief corporate reputation officer, said in a statement at the time. “Regardless, we will continue to cooperate with the city and we are addressing any prior noncompliance concerns,” she said. Tuesday’s complaints bring the total number of New York City Chipotle locations facing accusations to more than 20, 32BJ said. The National Restaurant Association, the industry’s main lobbying group, the International Franchise Association (IFA) and the New York State Restaurant Association have been fighting the city’s law in court since December. They argue the policy is prohibitively expensive for franchises, which are independently owned and operate more like a small business than a major corporation. “The unaffordable costs associated with this well-intentioned policy make it a challenge for these franchise small businesses to operate, which unfortunately jeopardizes the livelihoods of the very employees it aims to protect,” said IFA spokesman Stephen Worley. Seattle, the California cities of San Francisco, San Jose and Emeryville; and the state of Oregon have approved similar measures."

Carne asada, a dish of thin steak slices seasoned with signature spices, will be offered on the menu for a limited period of time. It was piloted in Cincinnati, Ohio, and Fresno, California, Chipotle said. “It performed incredibly well in the test markets,” said Chris Brandt, chief marketing officer of Chipotle. Chipotle has been working to rebuild its image under Chief Executive Officer Brian Niccol after a series of food safety lapses hit the company’s reputation in 2015. It has been testing new menu items in addition to other initiatives such as new ad campaigns and loyalty program to boost its turnaround. In July, Niccol teased the national rollout of new additions to the menu including carne asada, quesadillas, desserts and nachos. Last year, Chipotle added condiment queso cheese to its menu, but was initially met with bad reviews from some Twitter users calling it a “crime against cheese”, forcing the company to tweak the recipe. The latest rollout begins on Tuesday for Chipotle Rewards loyalty program members through its app and would be made available to all customers on Sept. 19, the restaurant chain said. In January, the company launched a new line of “lifestyle bowls”, including paleo and keto salads for online customers.

6.56977117046311," Chipotle's online shift fuels highest sales growth in two years (Reuters) - Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc's CMG.N aggressive push into online orders, amped up ads around fresh ingredients and the addition of healthier meals helped the burrito chain post its highest sales growth at established restaurants in over two years. The company provided an upbeat sales forecast for the rest of the year, signaling it was turning the corner from a series of food-safety lapses since 2015. Shares rose 3.7% late on Tuesday, adding to the 71% gain for the year and setting them up for a new record on Wednesday. Over the past few years, Chipotle has unleashed a number of initiatives including partnering with delivery services such as Doordash and revamped its menu to win back customers. The efforts have paid off. Sales at restaurants open for at least 13 months jumped 10% in the second quarter, their biggest increase since the first quarter of 2017. Analysts had estimated an 8.3% rise. “Everything that Chipotle is doing is working,” BTIG analyst Peter Saleh said. “It’s driving the topline and that is putting them in the driver’s seat on the market side.” Online sales nearly doubled in the second quarter, and accounted for 18.2% of total revenue, up from 15.7% in the preceding quarter. Online-only options such as “Lifestyle Bowls”, healthier meals that include paleo, keto and vegan salads, also pulled in more customers. Chipotle rolled out nationally a points based loyalty program in March, further incentivizing customers to buy more burritos and tacos and also allowing the company to promote tailored deals and menu items. “Chipotle Rewards” now has over 5 million members, Chief Executive Officer Brian Niccol said in a conference call with analysts. “It’s a driver of same-store sales, not just for the next year but for many years to come,” Saleh said. Chipotle said it spent about 3.3% of revenue on marketing in the latest quarter, up from 2.5% in the preceding quarter. But margins improved to 21% in the quarter, beating estimates of 20% as the company raised prices. Chipotle said it expected full-year same-restaurant sales to increase in the high-single digit percentage, compared with the prior mid-to-high single digit range estimate. Revenue rose 13.2% to $1.43 billion, beating estimates of $1.41 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. Excluding items, the company earned $3.99 per share, topping of estimates of $3.76.

29.020046416390688," Trump tariffs could cost an extra nickel per burrito, says Chipotle (Reuters) - Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc on Monday estimated a $15 million hit from President Donald Trump’s proposed tariffs on Mexican imports, and said it could cover that by raising burrito prices by around 5 cents. The U.S.-based Mexican-themed chain’s finance chief Jack Hartung said its margins would be reduced by 20-30 basis points if the tariffs suggested by Trump go up to 25%, pushing up prices of avocados - the key ingredient in guacamole. Mexico is the largest supplier of agricultural produce to the United States, exporting more than $8 billion worth of vegetables last year, including $2.07 billion worth of avocados, according to the U.S. census bureau. “We know that we could easily solve the volatility in our supply chain by purchasing pre-mashed or processed avocados,” Hartung said in an email. “But we ... believe that using whole, fresh ingredients ... leads to better tasting guacamole.” For an interactive graphic on border crossings and cross-border trade, click here: tmsnrt.rs/2Khd82D Chipotle is averse to switching to cheaper pre-mashed avocados, mainly as its marketing message centers around the use of fresh ingredients. To reduce its dependence on Mexico - the world’s largest producer of avocados - the company has been sourcing the crop from other countries such as Peru and Chile in the last several months, spokeswoman Laurie Schalow told Reuters. According to Chipotle’s last annual filing, a “substantial volume” of its produce is grown in Mexico and other countries, and any rise in prices of ingredients like avocados would affect its operating results. Chipotle is among the first U.S. companies to warn of pressure on prices from Trump’s commitment last Thursday to impose a 5% tariff, rapidly ratcheting higher to 25% on Oct. 1, on all goods coming from Mexico unless illegal immigration across the southern U.S. border halts. “We could also consider passing on these costs through a modest price increase, such as about a nickel on a burrito,” Hartung said. Chipotle’s shares fell 1.6% on Monday, having lost 3% on a broadly weaker New York Stock Exchange on Friday."

14.668105206428924," Latest subpoena sours Chipotle's quarterly beat (Reuters) - Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc said on Thursday it received another subpoena from U.S. federal prosecutors, seeking information related to an outbreak that left hundreds of people sick last year in one of its Ohio restaurant. Shares of the burrito chain fell 5 percent following the disclosure and after analysts said they see limited valuation even as the company posted better-than-expected quarterly sales and profit on Wednesday. “Its not a new incident but (the subpoena) is enough to shake off some of the more skittish bulls on the story,” said Maxim Group analyst Stephen Anderson. Over the past three years, the company has faced a number of subpoenas regarding sicknesses linked to its restaurants following an E. Coli, salmonella and norovirus outbreaks at the company’s outlets dating back to late 2015 that affected hundreds across several states. The latest subpoena is the fourth and is part of an ongoing criminal investigation being conducted by the U.S. Attorney’s office for the Central District of California. Last August, a type of bacteria found in meat and pre-cooked food left at unsafe temperatures was responsible for making hundreds of people ill in a Powell, Ohio restaurant. The subpoena, disclosed here in a regulatory filing on Thursday, sought information related to the incidents of illnesses associated with the Ohio restaurant and restaurants in California, Massachusetts, and Virginia, that were covered under previous subpoenas. Wednesday’s results follow Chipotle’s efforts in ramping up promotions, adding new menu items, and extending its delivery options. It also launched a loyalty program to attract customers. The upbeat results also prompted the company to raise its full-year comparable sales growth forecast to mid-to-high-single-digit, from the prior expectations of mid-single-digit growth. “While the company upgraded their comp outlook, we believe Chipotle needs to continue to hit double-digit comps to justify the current multiple,” said Mizuho Securities analyst Jeremy Scott. Chipotle trades 52.18 times its 12-month forward earnings, while Yum! Brands trades at 26.07 times and McDonalds’s trades 23.74 times. Analysts also highlighted that higher commodity costs, loyalty redemptions, and rising food costs would hurt Chipotle’s margins. Jefferies analyst Andy Barish said Chipotle is well-positioned with its initiatives and believes it is still in the early innings of its transition process. “However, valuation keeps us at ‘hold’(rating),” he added."

The company has rolled out ad campaigns that showcased the fresh ingredients in its tacos and burritos and launched a loyalty program in March as Chief Executive Officer Brian Niccol rebuilds the company’s image after a series of food-safety lapses. “Customer engagement and visits are increasing as a result of compelling marketing message, more convenient access, including delivery and strong operations,” Niccol said on a post-earnings call. The company’s rewards program has signed up 3 million members since its launch, while it ran a “Free Delivery bowl” promotion through December to early January. “Chipotle rewards will be a key element that will provide topspin to our digital system,” Niccol said.

The company beat comparable-restaurant sales estimates by the biggest margin in nearly two years on Wednesday, driven by Niccol’s decision to focus on food delivery and partner with services Doordash and Postmates. Niccol, the former head of Taco bell where he introduced mobile ordering, also gave a marketing blitz to Chipotle to highlight the freshness of ingredients used in its tacos and burritos. Wall Street was convinced that Chipotle’s December quarter was not a just a flash in the pan and more of a sign of things to come, as it comes out of the shadow of food safety scares that plagued it over three years ago. “Chipotle’s fourth-quarter update offered the clearest evidence to date that it has corrected organizational issues that led to underwhelming customer experience the past several years,” Morningstar analyst R.J. Hottovy said. At least 13 analysts raised their price target on the stock to as high as $650, a level Chipotle’s shares have not seen since 2015 when a raft of food safety lapses wreaked havoc on the company’s reputation and stock price. Chipotle shares were last up 13.8 percent at $598.62, touching a three-year high. The company’s traffic growth of 2 percent is among the best in the restaurant industry, with acceleration expected throughout 2019, Bernstein analyst Sara Senatore said. The California-based company is also working to freshen up its menu with quesadillas and Mexican chocolate milkshakes to incentivise customers who are tired of burritos and tacos. “To those who argue/worry that those are specific, non-repeatable promotions, we would argue that there are plenty of ideas still to come and that the convenience and speed that digital & delivery offer has created new, incremental occasions,” Morgan Stanley analyst John Glass said."

More than three years after a series of food-borne illnesses at restaurants tarnished the burrito chain’s reputation, the company has tried to win back customers through fresh menus and targeted marketing campaigns. Its latest campaign, called “For Real,” ran both on social media platforms and at restaurants, showcasing the freshness of ingredients used in its tacos and burritos. “I believe their image rehabilitation is close to complete,” said Doug Ciocca, the CEO of Kavar Capital Partners, which does not currently own shares in Chipotle but has positions in other restaurant companies. Brian Niccol, who was installed as Chipotle’s CEO a year ago after a successful stint at Taco Bell, has focused on improving the company’s food delivery through promotions, while also transforming the restaurant experience with new technology. For example, Chipotle offered free delivery during the College Bowl season in December, and gave away its much loved guacamole for free for those ordering through its app on “National Avocado Day” last year. Such promotions, besides tie-ups with food-delivery services Doordash and Postmates, helped “digital sales” rise nearly 66 percent in the December quarter, compared with about 48 percent in the previous quarter. “We’re going all in on providing more convenient user access to our customers and the response so far has been great,” Chief Financial Officer John Hartung said in an interview. “You’ll see more of that during the year.” The company reported that sales at outlets open for at least 13 months jumped 6.1 percent in the three months ended December, much better than Wall Street analysts’ average forecast of a 4.49 percent increase, according to IBES Refinitiv data.

34.39915950292794," Some U.S. funds waiting for earnings to buy shares of surging Chipotle NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill have surged over 70 percent over the last 12 months, but some U.S. fund managers are waiting for Feb. 6 earnings results to confirm that the burrito-chain is truly back from its 2015 food safety crisis. The company’s shares lost nearly 70 percent of their value between October 2015 and February 2018 as it struggled to win back customers after a multi-state E. coli outbreak that was linked to Chipotle in late 2015 and early 2016. Shares have rebounded since their 2018 lows thanks in part to the moves of its new Chief Executive Brian Niccol, the former head of rival Yum Brand Inc’s Taco Bell, to invest heavily in digital ordering and delivery. Shares of the company are up more than 23 percent since the start of January alone, yet remain well below their record highs of 2015. “The company is transitioning and is now back on offense versus defense,” said Peter Saleh, an analyst at BTIG. An increased share buyback and a series of positive earnings surprises helped convince 35 actively-managed U.S. equity funds to add a position in the company in 2018, pushing its total fund ownership up by nearly 36 percent, according to data from Lipper. Yet for the company to win more converts, it must now show that it can not only expand on its digital offerings but can maintain its profitability despite rising minimum wages that have largely soured U.S. fund managers on restaurants overall, fund managers say. The average actively-managed U.S. equity fund has slightly less than 1 percent of its portfolio in restaurant stocks, or about 16 percent less than the weighting in the benchmark S&P 500, according to Lipper data. “I like to buy stocks at new highs only because management is proving the fact that they can deliver. We are right at that inflection point where an earnings miss is going to lead to a significant correction and a beat is going to send it much higher,” said Robert Bacarella, portfolio manager of the Monetta Fund. Bacarella, who does not currently own Chipotle but has in the past, said that he would likely add the company to his portfolio should it continue to beat estimates, despite its high valuation. Chipotle is currently trading at a price to earnings ratio of 78.2, nearly double its 52-week low of 40.8. The company is expected to report earnings per share of $1.37 on revenue of $1.1 billion in its most recent quarter, according to Refinitiv data. Barbara Miller, a portfolio manager of the $5.9 billion Federated Kaufmann fund, who does not currently have a position in the company but owns shares of Wingstop Inc, said investors will be watching whether Chipotle can maintain its margins despite a tight labor market and rising minimum wages in states including California, Florida, and New York. “There’s no question that labor costs will continue to rise and keeping people in what tend to be high-turnover jobs is more of a challenge,” she said. Chipotle’s move into online ordering and delivery could help it balance out rising labor costs because digital orders tend to have higher tickets, she said. But it will need another year without any food safety scares to win back all of its former customers, she said. “It’s usually at least a couple of years for a company to restore its reputation but now it could be longer,” she said. “If something goes viral these days it can be hard to live down.”"
28.18957926548105," Chipotle tops profit estimates as turnaround takes shape (Reuters) - Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc CMG.N topped Wall Street profit estimates on Thursday, as newer menu items and a marketing blitz helped the burrito chain recover from a series of food-safety lapses that had kept diners away. Chipotle shares, up over 40 percent this year thanks to optimism around new CEO Brian Niccol’s plan to improve the company’s image, rose nearly 2 percent in extended trading. Niccol has brought back popular items like chorizo and introduced a long-awaited loyalty program, limited-time items and food-delivery through a dedicated smartphone app as well as DoorDash. “We are seeing strong interest from new and infrequent customers as well as frequent customers,” Niccol said of Chipotle’s mobile app, speaking to analysts on a conference call. Sales through digital channels surged 48 percent in the quarter ended September, Chipotle said. The company has also overhauled its marketing with increased use of social media channels and an ad campaign that draws attention to its use of “real” ingredients, aimed at health-conscious diners. “Marketing did have an impact as we went on air and as customers start to see the commercials ... we did see an improvement in our sales,” Niccol said. The once-popular burrito chain’s sales and shares are yet to fully recover since its restaurants were linked to E. coli and salmonella outbreaks in 2015 that sickened hundreds of people. A new spate of food safety issues this July had added to Chipotle’s headaches. However, the latest health-related incident at a single outlet that caused nearly 700 people to fall sick, did not have a lasting impact on sales, Chief Financial Officer Jack Hartung said on the conference call. Sales at Chipotle restaurants open at least 13 months rose 4.4 percent in the third quarter, helped by price hikes, but fell short of Wall Street expectations of a 5.02 percent increase, according to Refinitiv data. “The miss (was) widely known and expected,” Wedbush Securities analyst Nick Setyan said, adding that Chipotle was seeing some early success with its turnaround. Net income roughly doubled year-over-year to $38.2 million, while restaurant-level operating margin climbed to 18.7 percent from 16.1 percent, as Chipotle kept expenses in check. Excluding one-time items, Chipotle earned $2.16 per share, topping estimates of $2 per share. Revenue rose nearly 9 percent to $1.23 billion, matching expectations."

Sales at Chipotle restaurants open at least 13 months rose 4.4 percent in the third quarter ended Sept. 30. Analysts, on average, expected a rise of 5.02 percent, according to Refinitiv data. Net profit rose to $38.2 million, or $1.36 per share, from $19.6 million, or 69 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose nearly 9 percent to $1.23 billion."
-0.4145801652048978," Ackman says plans to stick with Chipotle after trimming holding BOSTON (Reuters) - Billionaire investor William Ackman, whose hedge fund is posting double-digit returns largely thanks to gains in Chipotle Mexican Grill CMG.N shares, said on Friday he expects to stay a long-term investor even after he sold some of the shares. “Chipotle is in the very early stages of beginning to realize its potential,” the fund manager told Reuters on Friday, adding that he “loves” the stock. Ackman spoke one day after his Pershing Square Capital Management hedge fund said in a regulatory filing that the firm had cut its holding in Chipotle to 7.4 percent of the company from 10.4 percent. His firm sold 823,357 shares for portfolio management purposes, the fund manager said. He said the Chipotle position had grown to be more than 20 percent of his roughly $8 billion portfolio as the stock price appreciated and that it needed to be cut back. He has periodically trimmed positions as they became too big. News of the sale came after the market closed on Thursday and sparked some concerns on Friday that Ackman was possibly losing interest in the company after owning it for almost two years. Ackman has helped turn the company around, playing a big role in wooing Chipotle’s new Chief Executive Officer Brian Niccol from Taco Bell. Since Niccol took over in March, the stock has gained 92 percent through Thursday’s close of $483.99. On Friday the stock lost 1.74 percent to trade at $475.55 late in the session. Ackman’s hedge funds have gained roughly 15 percent so far this year, beating the average hedge fund, which lost roughly half a percent, according to data from Hedge Fund Research."

Pershing Square Capital Management held a 10 percent stake in the Burrito chain as of March 3, 2017. Ackman, who bought the stake in 2016 for an average cost of $405, helped install Brian Niccol as chief executive of Chipotle in February. Since then, the stock has gained 92 percent through Thursday’s close of $483.99. The company’s shares were down more than 1 percent at $478.60 after the bell. A Pershing Square representative declined to comment. Chipotle has been struggling to regain its reputation following a series of food safety lapses in 2015 that sickened customers with E. coli and salmonella and the recent outbreak of illness at its restaurant in Ohio."

The service is part of new Chief Executive Officer Brian Niccol’s plan to turnaround the burrito chain that has had its reputation and stock price take a hit from a series of food safety lapses. Chipotle said diners would get free delivery on any order of $10 or more for a limited time, with delivery available in at over 1,800 Chipotle restaurants that DoorDash currently serves. Analysts say another recent food safety incident at a Chipotle outlet in Ohio could also keep diners away from the restaurants. Chipotle said the delivery option would be made available nationwide through its app and website, with DoorDash as the last mile delivery partner.

-5.955838727929052," Illness at Ohio Chipotle caused by food-borne bacteria: local officials (Reuters) - A type of bacteria found in meat and pre-cooked food left at unsafe temperatures was responsible for sickening hundreds of people who ate at a Chipotle Mexican Grill CMG.N restaurant in Ohio, local health officials said on Thursday. The outbreak last month was the latest in a series of food safety lapses at the burrito chain, and health officials said it was caused by the clostridium perfringens bacterium, which often infects food that is prepared in large quantities and kept warm for a long time. The resulting illnesses are fairly common and affect nearly 1 million people each year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). People usually recover in a day or two and the infection cannot spread from person to person. Customers had last month complained of food poisoning and diarrhea after eating tacos and burrito bowls at the Powell, Ohio Chipotle restaurant. Health officials said 647 people had self-reported gastrointestinal symptoms after eating there between July 26 and July 30. A specific food has not been identified as the source of the illness, and the CDC is conducting further tests, they added. Though not as severe as Chipotle’s food safety lapses in 2015 that sickened customers with E. coli and salmonella, the outbreak in Ohio is a headache for CEO Brian Niccol, who has been trying to repair Chipotle’s reputation. “With all of Brian Niccol’s turnaround efforts, you really have to have food safety as a foundation of what you do,” Maxim Group analyst Stephen Anderson said. Chipotle’s leadership will retrain restaurant employees nationwide about food safety and wellness protocols during working hours starting next week, company spokeswoman Laurie Schalow via email. The burrito chain will not close any restaurants and will add a recurring online employee assessment for food safety standards. In 2016, Chipotle shut all its stores for a few hours for food safety training. Chipotle shares reversed course to fall 3.8 percent on Thursday afternoon after hitting a two-year high earlier."

6.149975269566248," Chipotle slumps 9 percent after Ohio outlet linked to food poisoning complaints (Reuters) - More than 100 people said they had fallen sick after eating at a Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc CMG.N restaurant in Ohio, sending shares of the burrito chain down as much as 9 percent on Tuesday. The customers said they suffered from food poisoning and diarrhea after eating dishes including tacos and burrito bowls at the Powell, Ohio restaurant over the past few days, according to food safety website iwaspoisoned.com. The Delaware General Health District, which is investigating the food safety incident, told Reuters the county health department had got more than 100 calls since receiving the first complaint linked to the restaurant on Sunday. Public information officer Traci Whittaker said the department was investigating food samples from the outlet, but is still not aware of the pathogen that caused the illnesses. The reports come just after the agency had routinely inspected the restaurant on July 26 and found that lettuce and beans were not stored at the right temperature. However, the infractions were immediately corrected, Whittaker said. Chipotle shut the restaurant on Monday after it received complaints of illness from two customers, Laurie Schalow, the company’s chief communications officer, said in an email. “We acted quickly and closed this single restaurant out of an abundance of caution yesterday. We are working with the local health department and we plan to reopen this restaurant today,” Schalow said on Tuesday. The Powell outlet said in a phone call that it was working to get the restaurant open by Tuesday afternoon. The news is another setback to the company, which was recovering from a series of high-profile food safety lapses in 2015 that sickened more than 100 customers with E. coli and salmonella and bruised Chipotle’s reputation and stock price. It is also the first major food safety issue under new Chief Executive Brian Niccol as he works to bring back customers to the Mexican food chain that once was an investor darling. The stock traded over $700 just two months before the 2015 food safety incidents. “If this story gains traction, it might have more serious implications for the stock. It certainly, at this point, is a negative. I think it is something the CEO should address,” Maxim Group analyst Stephen Anderson said. The company’s shares were down 5.6 percent at $439.60, erasing gains made since Chipotle reported stronger-than-expected profit and same-restaurant sales for its second quarter on Thursday."

-1.8757285371177335," Chipotle price hikes, queso cheese boost sales past estimates (Reuters) - Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc CMG.N topped analysts' estimates for same-restaurant sales on Thursday, boosted by higher prices and demand for its queso cheese dip as its new CEO focuses on turning around the once-hot burrito chain. Chipotle shares, which have soared over 56 percent this year, mainly buoyed by optimism around its new CEO, rose 6.3 percent in extended trading. The company has pulled off a successful hike in prices at a time when fast-food chains are relying on low-price value menus to boost sales and market share. The move shows that the premium burrito chain, despite past food safety scares, is largely escaping the intense competition in the value space that took a toll on McDonald's MCD.N quarterly U.S. same-store sales earlier on Thursday. Chipotle made a rare addition to its menu last year with queso cheese, but was met with bland reviews with some Twitter users calling it a “crime against cheese”, forcing the company to tweak the recipe. A 4 percent rise in prices helped sales at Chipotle restaurants, open for at least 13 months, increase 3.3 percent in the second quarter, beating analysts’ estimates of a 2.7 percent rise, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Niccol — in the five months at the helm — has made top management changes, spent more on marketing and focused on its online business. “We also saw in the quarter people really responded positively to the advertising that we put out there,” Niccol said. Net income fell to $46.9 million, or $1.68 per share, in the quarter ended June 30, from $66.73 million, or $2.32 per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 8.3 percent to $1.27 billion, hurt by a charge related to the closure of some underperforming restaurants. Excluding items, the company earned $2.87 cents per share. Analysts on average had expected the company to earn $2.80 per share on revenue of $1.26 billion."

6.107013940622866," Chipotle CEO plans marketing blitz, closing up to 65 stores (Reuters) - Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc CMG.N said on Wednesday the chain will shut up to 65 underperforming restaurants and revamp its marketing under Chief Executive Officer Brian Niccol, but many questions remain unanswered about what to expect under the new leadership. Chipotle’s share price has risen more than 80 percent since Niccol’s hiring was announced in February and as the company focused on how to increase online sales. Chipotle will add “in-app” delivery of its products to about 2,000 restaurants by the end of the year and launch a long-awaited loyalty program in 2019, executives said on a call with investors on Wednesday. Executives did not say whether fast-casual dining menu items such as quesadillas and nachos would be added to the menu, and they brushed aside a question about international plans, saying they would focus on “aggressive growth” in the United States. Shares fell 3.1 percent to $443 in after-hours trade after few details were delivered on how the beleaguered burrito maker would innovate its business model and improve its digital service. “There are some key areas they really did not address, notably international strategy,” Maxim Group analyst Stephen Anderson said. “Also capital allocation, particularly in regard to share buybacks and potential discussion for a dividend. I still think it will happen but it is probably going to be about a year or two away,” Anderson said. Executives said costs from corporate restructuring would cause the chain to take between $115 million to $135 million in charges, including about $50 million to $60 million in the second quarter. The chain will close 55 to 65 restaurants. Chipotle also said it would launch a customer loyalty program in 2019 and is exploring offering $2 tacos with a drink as part of a proposed “happy hour.” The announced changes come as the troubled burrito chain seeks to recover after a rash of food safety lapses dragged on the brand. After outbreaks of E. coli, salmonella and norovirus were linked to its restaurants in 2015, the company’s share price plummeted as diners retreated and rival chains grew their numbers through wider offerings and clever promotions. While Chipotle made its name as a pioneer of “real” ingredients, critics of the fast-casual chain have complained that its menu offerings have grown stale. Niccol, the former chief of Yum Brands Inc's YUM.N Taco Bell who spearheaded the popular ""Doritos Locos Tacos"" and $1 Nacho Fries prior to joining Chipotle in March, is on track to bring some new flair to the chain's menu. Earlier this month, the company announced it is testing five new items, including quesadillas and nachos, at its test kitchen in New York. Analysts and investors expect Niccol to steer the company in a more modern direction, including through technology improvements, menu expansion and potentially opening the brand up to franchising. Analysts on average expect Chipotle’s retail sales to grow 8.4 percent in 2018, following 15 percent growth in 2017 and a 13 percent drop in 2016, according to Thomson Reuters data."

5.742014201183437," Chipotle restaurant sales beat Street, CEO cites 'recovery story' LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc CMG.N on Wednesday reported sales at established restaurants and profit for the first quarter that beat expectations, and new Chief Executive Brian Niccol told investors that the beleaguered burrito chain has begun its turnaround. Chipotle shares jumped 10.5 percent in after-hours trading. Chipotle is “clearly a recovery story in the U.S.,” Niccol said in his first conference call with analysts and investors, after taking over as CEO on March 5. Wall Street is hungry to learn details of Niccol’s strategy for putting Chipotle’s sales slump from food safety lapses behind it and adding flair to a menu that has grown tired. Niccol, the former chief of Yum Brands Inc's YUM.N Taco Bell, is known for launching hot new menu items, such as $1 Nacho Fries shortly before he made the leap to Chipotle. Sales at Chipotle restaurants open a least 13 months rose a better-than-expected 2.2 percent in the first quarter, with menu price increases again offsetting declines in customer visits. Net profit jumped almost 29 percent to $59.4 million, or $2.13 per share, handily beating analysts’ average estimate of $1.57 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Chipotle has struggled since outbreaks of E.coli, salmonella and norovirus that were linked to the chain in 2015, and despite millions of dollars in free food giveaways it failed to win back diners. Niccol said “Mission One” is to make the brand more visible with messages that remind diners what makes the chain different. He brought in a Taco Bell alum to replace long-time Chipotle marketing chief Mark Crumpacker. And the chain has also already made some “simple pivots” on messaging - releasing punchy and light-hearted ads focusing on Chipotle’s “real” ingredients such as grilled adobo chicken, freshly made chips and hand-mashed guacamole. On the operational side, Chipotle set new goals for cutting food and packaging waste and linked executive compensation to sales and margin growth at restaurants. Other opportunities include adding new meal occasions - more likely late-night than breakfast in the near term - tweaking menus to broaden appeal, and increasing access through delivery, catering and mobile ordering, Niccol said. Selling the chain’s 2,441 restaurants, something some investors advocate, is not on the table. “We see no need to go down that path right now,” Niccol said. Chipotle shares are up about 35 percent since Feb. 13, when the company announced Niccol's hire. They are trading at a price-to-earnings ratio of 54, more than double that of McDonald's Corp MCD.N and Starbucks Corp SBUX.O, according to Thomson Reuters data. The 10.5 percent jump in Chipotle shares in extended trading on Wednesday brought them to $373.50. Still, they remain far below their all-time high of more than $742 in the summer of 2015, just months before news of the food poisoning outbreaks that sickened hundreds of U.S. customers and unmasked operational weaknesses at the former high-flying chain."

33.02015187094035," Chipotle rallies ahead of debut report from new CEO SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill CMG.N rallied on Wednesday ahead of the company's first quarterly report under a new chief executive hired to turn around the struggling burrito chain. Chipotle has surged 36 percent since announcing in February that it hired Brian Niccol from Yum Brands Inc's YUM.N Taco Bell unit as CEO to win back customers lost after a series of food safety lapses. Wall Street’s recent optimism has focused on what Niccol is likely to do, rather than on Chipotle’s performance during his short time at the helm. Niccol, known for his menu and marketing prowess, could refresh Chipotle’s limited offerings by, for instance, adding quesadillas, nachos or margaritas, and he could streamline operations across the chain’s 2,408 restaurants. He replaced Chipotle founder Steve Ells, who failed to put Chipotle back on track following outbreaks of E.coli, Salmonella and norovirus in 2015 that sickened hundreds of U.S. customers and crushed sales. The stock has lost half of its value from record highs just before those mishaps. Niccol, who will lead his first quarterly conference call with analysts on Wednesday after the stock market closes, took the helm on March 5, with under a month remaining in the quarter. “It seems unlikely that the quarter really will matter here as the focus will be entirely on new CEO Brian Niccol’s thoughts,” Quo Vadis Capital President John Zolidis wrote in a client note. Chipotle’s stock was up 2.1 percent at $340.20 at mid-day, outperforming a 0.1 percent rise in the S&P 500. Options activity implied traders expect a 6.6 percent swing in Chipotle’s stock by Friday, according to Trade Alerts. So far, Niccol has brought in a Taco Bell alum to replace long-time Chipotle marketing chief Mark Crumpacker, who in 2017 pleaded guilty to cocaine possession. He also announced plans to cut food and packaging waste and linked executive compensation to sales and margin growth at restaurants. Under Niccol, Chipotle could also boost technology-enabled sales and increase catering and deliveries, Maxim analyst Stephen Anderson wrote in a report.
